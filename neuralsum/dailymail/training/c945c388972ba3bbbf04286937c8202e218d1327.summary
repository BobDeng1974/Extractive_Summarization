by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:30 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 04:06 est , 25 october 2012 @entity2 faces a probe by the statistics watchdog after giving the clearest hint yet that the @entity7 economy is out of recession - before official data showed the economy grew by 1.0 per cent			1
an increasingly buoyant prime minister told @entity11 that after falls in inflation and unemployment ' the good news will keep on coming '			1
but the prime minister faced claims of breaking the law , because senior government figures get to see the economic growth figures 24 hours before they are made public - but must keep them secret			1
the @entity21 is now investigating whether the @entity22 broke the rules			1
@entity2 said drops in inflation and unemployment would be followed by more positive economic data mr @entity2 ’s remarks have been widely seen as confirmation that the longest double - dip recession since the @entity30 is finally over			1
economists have predicted that today ’s figures will show a return to growth , but @entity35 accused the pm of ‘ playing fast and loose ’ with the official data due to be released by the @entity38 at 9.30am today			1
a spokesman for the @entity21 said it had received a number of queries about the prime minister ’s words , adding : ' we are going to look into it			1
' @entity21 chairman @entity47 has previously called for pre-release access to statistics to be removed			1
' i just do not understand how a reasonable person could say that was necessary			0
'' yesterday @entity53 , a former @entity55 and @entity56 advisor to @entity57 , tweeted : ' just to be clear , the @entity36 received @entity59 's gdp figs at 9.30am today			2
his " good news " slip will cause a big row with the @entity38 , maybe more			0
' law is clear : " no indication of their content [ may be ] disclosed			2
" ' gross domestic product ( gdp ) - a broad measure for the total economy - grew by a higher than expected 1.0 per cent between july and september , ending three consecutive quarters of declining output			1
there has been a run of good economic news for the government in recent weeks			2
there are now more people in work than at any point since records began in 1971 , it emerged last week			0
the prime minister said every new set of good figures sent @entity35 ' into a complete decline ' in the three months to august , unemployment dropped by 50,000 to 2.53million			1
youth unemployment fell by 62,000 to 957,000 , the lowest figure for over a year			2
and in inflation in september dropped to 2.2 per cent , its lowest level for three years			1
labour leader @entity93 mocked mr @entity2 at @entity83 's questions for a ' disastrous week ' which had seen the resignation of his chief whip and the unravelling of an energy policy			0
but the @entity36 told the @entity100 : ‘ it 's only a bad week if you think it 's bad that unemployment 's coming down , it 's only a bad week if you regret inflation coming down			1
’ he said ‘ every piece of good news ’ sends @entity35 ‘ into a complete decline ’ , adding : ‘ i can tell him , the good news will keep on coming			0
’ @entity56 sought to play down the idea that he was referring to today ’s gdp figures			2
but a spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister clearly believes the government has the right policies			1
’ however , @entity35 said mr @entity2 was wrong to pre-empt the @entity38			0
@entity118 , @entity35 ’s shadow chief secretary to the treasury , said : ' the prime minister seems to have let slip what we already knew – that the @entity121 will help @entity7 finally emerge from the longest double - dip recession since the @entity30			1
the question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one - off @entity121 and @entity128 effects			0
' what really matters for jobs , living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years			0
' growth of one per cent would simply mean the economy is the same size as a year ago			2
a one - off boost from the @entity121 is no substitute for a long - term strategy and should not breed yet more complacency from @entity2 and @entity143			0
' however , @entity56 insisted mr @entity2 was not directly referring to the official figures			0
@entity7 emerged from recession in late 2009 , but two years later the economy started shrinking again			0
while the end of the recession will be good news , the @entity7 economy is still struggling			0
record numbers of people are now in work , according to figures last week			0
this graph drawn from figures from the @entity157 shows how many have had jobs since 1992 ( in thousands ) in its latest @entity161 , the @entity160 - based @entity159 said it expects the @entity7 economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year - far worse than the 0.2 per cent growth forecast in july			1
the bounce back to growth will also be tempered by warnings about the underlying health of the economy , with the recovery likely to be driven by one - off factors like the @entity121			0
@entity171 , chief @entity7 and @entity173 economist at @entity174 , warned any recovery was looking ' fragile , feeble and far from guaranteed '			0
' looking through the distortions to @entity178 in the second and third quarter , the likelihood is that the economy is eking out limited growth , ' he added			0
the economy shrank by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter of this year , according to the @entity38 , which was revised up gradually from an initial estimate of a 0.7 per cent decline .			2

the prime minister said drops in unemployment and inflation would be followed by more positive economic data
@entity157 today said economy grew by 1.0 per cent
ministers are given 24 hours ' notice but are supposed to keep them secret
@entity21 is investigating whether the pm broke the law
