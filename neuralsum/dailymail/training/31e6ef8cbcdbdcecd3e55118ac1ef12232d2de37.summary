@entity0 is to propose an ‘ emergency brake ’ that could be applied to prevent large numbers of immigrants arriving from @entity4			0
a system that would allow the @entity0 to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by senior ministers			2
initial negotiations are already under way over what would be a fundamental reform of the @entity18 ’s founding principle of free movement of people between countries , @entity12 sources say			1
proposals : @entity0 is to propose an ‘ emergency brake ’ that could be applied to prevent large numbers of immigrants arriving from @entity4 the idea is winning support in @entity26 and @entity27 , which have also seen large influxes of migrant workers from poorer states that have joined the @entity18			1
senior figures in some of the newer @entity18 states are also said to be open to reform , having seen their economies ‘ hollowed out ’ by the departure of better educated workers to richer countries			1
the ‘ emergency brake ’ on inflows from @entity4 countries would be applied if numbers exceeded expectations			0
the proposal will be a central demand of @entity45 ’s plan to renegotiate @entity0 ’s membership of the @entity18 if he wins next year ’s general election			1
it would allow the @entity0 or other countries to bar any further arrivals for a fixed period			0
plan : the proposal will be a central demand of @entity45 ’s plan to renegotiate @entity0 ’s membership of the @entity18 if he wins next year ’s general election this could prevent a repeat of what happened in 2004 , when @entity58 opted not to impose transitional controls on @entity18 migrants from countries , including @entity62 , which had joined the @entity18			1
the @entity63 predicted the decision would lead to around 13,000 additional immigrants a year coming to @entity0			0
but that year , net migration leapt by nearly 130,000			0
more recently , the @entity0 has seen a surge in arrivals from southern @entity4 countries still mired in economic misery			0
conservative ministers are understood to be prepared to use @entity0 ’s veto to prevent any further expansion of the @entity18 bloc unless free movement is reformed			1
they also want new rules to apply to all new member states stipulating their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed			0
suggestion : home secretary @entity84 said she and mr @entity45 have suggested that new @entity18 countries should not enjoy full free movement rights until their economy is at a certain level this is designed to prevent the overwhelming incentive for people to move from poor countries to richer ones			1
home secretary @entity84 , speaking at a fringe event at the @entity96 conference in @entity97 , said : ‘ we can control far more of the immigration from outside the @entity18 than inside it			0
‘ but this is an area where @entity45 and i have said we need to look to the future to talk about the rules , particularly for countries coming into the @entity18 in the future , and putting some sort of brake on their access to full free movement			2
‘ for example , one idea we ’ve suggested is they should n’t have full free movement rights until their gdp , their economy , is at a certain level compared to other economies within the @entity18			2
