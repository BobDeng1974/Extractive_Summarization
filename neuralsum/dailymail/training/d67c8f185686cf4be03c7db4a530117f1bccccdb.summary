it is a familiar story of an overseas player coming to the @entity2 and struggling with idiosyncrasies of @entity5 life when they arrive : the weather , the food , the intensity of the football			1
the only difference is that @entity11 is @entity5			1
being a 20 - year - old £ 4million recruit from @entity13 and making an immediate impact on the @entity2 is n’t so remarkable these days			1
being an @entity5 so immersed in @entity16 life , where he grew up and played for @entity17 , that his mum feared he was losing his native language is more noteworthy			1
‘ when i moved to the @entity17 academy and went to a @entity16 school my mum said she was worried because my @entity16 was getting better than my @entity5 , ’ said @entity11 , whose family moved to @entity13 when he was seven because his mother ’s role as director of a catering company meant she had to be there to prepare for @entity25			1
‘ my whole life was in @entity16			1
i only spoke to my family in @entity5			1
perhaps more importantly , @entity35 have two clean sheets in the @entity2 and he has settled in very well under @entity40			1
but however @entity41 he might look and however well connected he might be in @entity5 — his grandfather , @entity42 , was the former secretary of the @entity43 — it is bewildering to be back			1
although his parents now live in @entity46 , almost all his life has been spent in another country and he is still searching for his bearings			2
‘ it ’s really strange , ’ he said			2
‘ last time i was living here i was seven and i do n’t really remember it			2
it was n’t strange being here for a week , but then when i stayed here after that , two weeks , three weeks , then it became strange			2
but i ’m getting used to it			0
’ naturally he misses the country that was his home			0
‘ all my friends are @entity16 and live in @entity16			1
you have restaurants , places you go			0
the food ... ’ he said wistfully			0
the biggest difference ? ‘ the weather ! ’ he said instantly , though he claims he does n’t mind the rain			0
bargain : @entity11 was signed by @entity35 for £ 4.5 million from @entity17 hot spur : the 20 - year - old has scored two goals in as many games for his new club ironically , when he was first picked up by @entity17 scouts from his ex-pat existence — his school was initially an international one and his life on the @entity76 was conducted in @entity5 — he experienced the culture shock in reverse			1
‘ from eight years old to 13 , i did n’t live in at the academy but i was training at @entity17 and in the beginning i was seen as an outsider , ’ he said			1
‘ i did n’t speak the language very well which made it really hard			0
but once i had learnt the language and they realised i was n’t going anywhere , i did n’t have any problems			0
by the time i was 13 i was settled and i was just like one of them			0
’ it was a privileged start in life as @entity17 ’s academy is a prestigious alma mater , having produced @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
‘ they like to remind you , ’ he said			0
‘ there are pictures everywhere , big , big photographs			0
’ giving something back : @entity11 met students at the @entity104 to help young people @entity11 made a special visit to @entity104 in @entity46 to meet students studying in @entity110 ’s @entity109 programme , taking part in a q&a session			1
@entity110 ’s @entity109 programme uses football as way to engage young people in education it also afforded him opportunities most of his contemporaries have not had			1
instead of playing in the @entity2 ’s @entity119 at training grounds in front of scouts and parents for the past two years , he has featured in @entity17 ’s first team taking on the likes of @entity126 in front of 64,000 in the @entity129 derby			1
‘ i do n’t think anything anywhere matches playing @entity126 , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s just different to anything anywhere else			0
they ’re night games , they hate each other , there are flares and banners : everything goes off ; the whole country stops			2
apart from the big teams , there are n’t many competitive games in @entity13 , so when that game comes it ’s a big occasion			1
’ road to success : a young @entity11 ( @entity150 ) before he left @entity5 and joined @entity17 's academy ( r ) hero worship : a young @entity11 meets @entity5 icon @entity153 while he was in @entity16 equally , he has been schooled in an entirely different way from many young @entity5 players , only being allowed to play small - sided games until he was 12 , a move now replicated at most @entity5 clubs			1
‘ we played seven - a - side when i was much younger and you played a 2 - 3 - 1 with a goalkeeper			2
the two defenders — i was one of them — did n’t work as centre - backs , they worked as full - backs			1
you would go wide and one would attack at a time and be a big part of attacking			0
’ that presumably accounts for his adaptability at centre - half or right - back and his ability to bring the ball out with more poise than most @entity5 defenders			1
he sees himself as a ball - playing defender — ‘ i do n’t want to burst my own bubble but i ’d like to think so ’ — and cites the likes of @entity180 and @entity181 as influences			1
‘ i think any kid would choose to look at one of them , more than a traditional centre - back			1
it ’s more likeable , is n’t it ? ’ lost in translation : @entity11 has had to re-adapt to life in @entity5 after living in @entity16 for so long @entity191 : the 20 - year - old learned his football education while playing for @entity17 hall of fame : @entity95 and @entity94 ( r ) both started their careers at @entity17 he experienced traditional @entity5 coaching when he had a short spell at @entity199 on loan at 17 and it seems the main difference was the shouting			1
‘ it was tough , ’ he said			0
‘ in @entity16 you are not used to coaches screaming at you			1
they just sit there and watch			0
so it toughened me up			0
’ he laughs at the thought			0
‘ i was probably still seen as soft to them but it toughened me up ! ‘ that was hard for me , going to @entity210 because i was there by myself			0
i was 16 , 17			0
i had left @entity16 , which was my home and left my friends and family			2
so it was a massive culture shock			1
but it helped me a lot			0
i always say i went there a boy and went back a man			2
’ and although he returned to @entity17 after @entity199 , his intention was always to return to his home country if he could			1
‘ it ’s a massive step up			0
i ’m not going to get carried away saying it ’s the same , because it ’s not , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a completely different world			0
i was texting @entity223 at @entity224 the other day , because we were at @entity17 together and he said the same things			2
it ’s a different world in every way			0
every game is competitive , in every game the stadium is full , home and away			0
there are loads of great players : @entity35 have great players , @entity210 , @entity224 , it ’s full of superstars			1
’ familiar faces : @entity239 will come up against @entity240 ( @entity150 ) again when @entity35 face @entity210 he will be facing a few of those stars on sunday			2
one he knows well in @entity240 — ‘ a really , really good player ’ — having played against him when the @entity244 was at @entity126 ; another , @entity243 , is less familiar though he is equally unfazed			0
‘ it does n’t really bother me to be honest , ’ said @entity11			2
‘ they ’re great players but i just try to respect any player and try to do my best			2
i ’m not really bothered who it is			0
’ and given such confidence , you would imagine he will soon feel right at home here			0
it ’s not too late to play @entity254 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			2
