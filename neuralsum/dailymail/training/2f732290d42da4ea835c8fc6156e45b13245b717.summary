by @entity0 when @entity1 was just 25 , she started to notice bleeding every time she went to the toilet			1
she repeatedly visited her gp and expressed her concern that she was suffering from bowel cancer			1
on three occasions over six months , the doctor told her she was too young to have the disease			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity20 , told @entity21 : ‘ i thought i had cancer and that was my biggest fear but the doctor said i was too young			1
‘ despite the gp , i was still worried and it was always at the back of my mind			0
‘ i was told it was piles and i did believe the doctor in a way - i thought i would just have them removed			1
’ ms @entity1 , who plans events and weddings at her family ’s golf course , started to notice bleeding when she went to the toilet in january 2011			1
she also noticed that she was losing weight gradually and her stomach became uncomfortable			1
before she was diagnosed , ms @entity1 went to her gp four times suffering from bleeding when she went to the toilet , weight loss , fatigue and stomach pains ms @entity1 ( left as a bridesmaid at her best friend @entity11 's wedding ) had to have chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery after the cancer was finally diagnosed initially , she believed that her weight loss was down to working hard and being on her feet all day at work			1
however , by july she was starting to feel tired and her stomach was painful at night			2
between january and july ms @entity1 , who is now 28 , visited her gp three times			1
on the first occasion the doctor asked her what she believed was wrong with her and she said she thought she had bowel cancer			2
bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel			2
it is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer			2
symptoms include blood in the stools , a change in bowel habits , abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss			1
as the disease progresses , it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness			2
bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in @entity79 and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year			2
approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65			2
people who are older , who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat , those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk			0
people who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol , as well as those with a family history of the disease , are also at increased risk			0
source : @entity99 however , the doctor dismissed her concerns saying she was too young			2
at first , she was told she had piles and was given treatment for this but it failed to stop the bleeding			1
by the time she returned to the doctor , she had also developed acid reflux so she was given medication for this but that also failed to help			1
finally , at the end of the summer , she returned to the doctor for a fourth time and an internal examination revealed some old blood			2
as a result , the doctor referred her to a specialist thinking she might have @entity121 ’s disease			2
ms @entity1 had a procedure during which a camera was used to look at her bowel			1
she said : ‘ as soon as the doctor put the camera in , she went very serious			0
‘ she said she had found a polyp – i could see it on the screen and it was horrible			0
‘ the lady went to get a second opinion and the doctors said it was something they only see in the over- 50s			0
‘ even so , at this point i still just thought it was a polyp that would have to be cut out			0
’ ms @entity1 was quickly sent for an mri and ct scan at @entity140 and was given the results a week later			1
she was told that she had bowel cancer but that it had not spread			1
she told @entity21 : ‘ i was – i ca n’t really explain it – i got really angry and shouted at my parents that i knew i had cancer and no one believed me			1
’ ms @entity1 was advised that she would need to start treatment as soon as possible but that she could , firstly , have some of her eggs harvested and frozen as the treatment would leave her infertile			1
after much deliberation , she turned down the offer as she wanted to get on with the treatment			0
ms @entity1 ( second from right with friends during a charity run ) has been left with a stoma bag and has also been told that she will not be able to have children because of the treatment she received she had three months of chemotherapy followed by five weeks of radiotherapy			1
she then had a break from treatment to regain her strength before having surgery to remove the lower part of her bowel , including the tumour			1
as a result , she has been left with a stoma bag - she had to have an ileostomy which is a surgical procedure to link the end of the small intestine to an opening in the abdomen			2
she now has to connect an external bag – a stoma bag - to the opening to collect waste products			2
following the surgery , she had to have another three months of chemotherapy and she was only given the all clear in december 2012			1
she now has to have check - ups every six months but this will soon change to every two years if everything goes well			1
her surgeons have also explained that her cancer was not caused by her diet or lifestyle and that they are also unable to find a genetic cause			0
ms @entity1 has now been free of the disease for more than a year but continues to have regular check - ups they say she was probably just very unlucky			1
she said : ‘ i am angry that it took so long for me to get the diagnosis and i do n’t see that @entity193 any more			0
‘ but , i can see that doctors do n’t expect young people to have cancer – let alone bowel cancer			1
‘ i think that if people are bleeding they should always be checked out			0
’ she added : ‘ now it is like the cancer never happened to me – looking back it is like it happened to someone else			0
‘ but , now i really do think more about what i put in my body and i do think twice about drinking			0
‘ i just try to be happy – that is the main thing in life because you do n’t know what is around the corner			0
‘ it gives you a massive wakeup call and now i try not to do things i do n’t want to do but to focus on things that make me happy and that do n’t make me stressed			0

more than 40,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the @entity221 every year and it is the @entity221 's second biggest cancer killer			0

if caught at its earliest stages , 93 per cent of patients will live for more than five years			0
however , in 91 per cent of patients it has spread further by the time it is diagnosed			0
a recent study by private health insurer @entity238 healthcare revealed half of @entity221 people have ignored worrying symptoms such as lumps , pain or bleeding			1
it also showed that 48 per cent of men are unable to name a single symptom of bowel cancer			0
the research also revealed that one in three adults have turned down an invitation to take part in a screening programme and a third say they are too embarrassed to get checked			0
dr @entity256 , @entity238 healthcare ’s chief medical officer , said : ' when dealing with bowel cancer you ca n’t underestimate the importance of early diagnosis			0
' we need to increase people ’s understanding of the disease and encourage them to see their gp if they show signs or symptoms of the disease			0
