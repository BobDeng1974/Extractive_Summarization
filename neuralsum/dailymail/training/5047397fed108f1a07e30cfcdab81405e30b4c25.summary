by @entity1 reporter published : 05:53 est , 22 july 2012 updated : 02:27 est , 23 july 2012 more than 250 foreign criminals including killers , paedophiles , rapists and a terrorist were allowed to stay in the country last year on human rights grounds without @entity10 lawyers challenging their cases in court			1
their applications to stay were simply rubber stamped by a @entity15 official			1
the number of such cases has increased five-fold in the past three years			2
it has raised fears that some appeal cases are not being challenged in the courts when they should be			2
worrying : killers and rapists were among 250 foreign criminals who should have been deported at the end of their prison sentences but were instead allowed to stay in @entity27 without their cases being considered by a court however officials insisted it was pointless fighting appeals they were bound to lose			1
they said the real problem was immigration rules that allowed too many claims to succeed under @entity35 of the @entity36 , which guarantees the right to respect for private and family life action : home secretary @entity40 last year announced a crackdown on use of the ' right to a family life ' defence to avoid deportation a freedom of information request revealed more than 600 human rights appeal cases were approved by the @entity15 in the past four years			1
the number has risen from 56 in 2008 to 80 in 2009 , 217 in 2010 and 250 last year , it was reported yesterday			0
on top of the 250 cases that were not challenged , 409 offenders were allowed to stay last year after a judge approved their appeal against deportation			1
ministers have introduced tougher rules on the use of @entity35 8 , which has been blamed for allowing foreign criminals to stay in this country despite committing horrendous crimes			2
they include @entity61 , who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car			0
a @entity66 spokesman said it was pointless to challenge cases it expected to lose and had changed the rules to make it easier to reject human rights claims			1
he added : ‘ there is no point in wasting taxpayers ’ money contesting cases where we were advised we would lose			0
‘ we examined each claim but case law based on the old rules meant the courts were highly likely to uphold them			0
‘ that ’s why we changed the rules last month to help us remove criminals who try to use @entity35 8 to dodge deportation			0
‘ as a result , we believe that we will see fewer cases where the government is likely to lose and therefore fewer uncontested hearings			0
’ accusations : @entity94 , the @entity95 shadow immigration minister claimed the real problem is @entity40 's inability to get a grip of her department			0

one terrorist , up to eight killers and rapists , 20 robbers and eight paedophiles were given *permission* to stay
the @entity15 accepted that deporting them would be a breach or their human rights
