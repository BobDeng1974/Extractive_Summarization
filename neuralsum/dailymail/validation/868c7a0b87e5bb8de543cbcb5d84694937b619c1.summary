@entity0 returns to the @entity2 team after serving a two - match ban in domestic football and @entity5 admits the club has learned valuable lessons from the way he was allowed to leave for @entity9			1
@entity0 has become arguably the most important player in @entity5 's team , providing the midfield security and physical presence which allows others the freedom to create			1
the @entity2 boss insisted he would ' never ' have allowed the @entity17 to leave @entity18 but understands how it happened and applauded the board for showing the courage to sign him again for Â£ 22million , three years after he joined @entity9 as a makeweight in a deal to sign @entity25			1
@entity5 believes @entity2 were ' brave ' in deciding to bring @entity0 back to @entity18 @entity0 has become an important member of @entity2 's first team since rejoining @entity2 the 28 - year - old has missed @entity2 's last two games against @entity30 and @entity31 due to suspension ' @entity2 were brave by bringing him back , ' said @entity5			1
' if in this world you want to do the best for your club you do n't protect yourself from possible critics			2
you simply do what you think is the best			2
' we wanted a midfield player and we had on the table three or four but the best one he was a former @entity2 player			1
i do n't say a player they lost but they were brave to say we are sure this is the right one , we are sure he is the best one , we are sure he is going to be a success here			2
' probably the next time @entity2 does a deal with a young player they will keep control			1
at these ages , the evolution of players can be good or bad			0
you can loan or even sell a player but you have ways of being in control of his future			0
' another aspect is the fact that @entity2 had so many managers in these years			1
it is difficult for the business people on the board			0
for one manager , @entity0 is the right profile of player , another one thinks @entity0 can go because i do n't like him			1
this guy i like because he is fast , this guy i do n't like because he is small			0
' with a philosophy on the table , it is much easier for our board			0
if i was here , a left - footed player , 1.95 metres tall , would never , never , never leave			0
' @entity0 was handed a two - match suspension for pushing @entity81 's @entity80 @entity5 insists @entity0 would n't have been sold if he was in charge during the midfielder 's first @entity2 spell @entity0 was sent off against @entity81 last month for a retaliatory push on @entity80 and missed the @entity87 final against @entity30 and a @entity89 derby at @entity31 , when young centre - half @entity90 deputised in midfield			1
he returns to the team for the @entity94 last - 16 tie against @entity95 at @entity18 , which is poised at 1 - 1 after the first leg in @entity97			0
' it is goof to have him back with we did well without him , ' said @entity5			1
' so i 've told him maybe he is not so important			0
it was a bit of a joke and he laughed , but i told him we won a final and beat @entity31 at @entity31 , so we did well without him			0
' but he is important , of course he is			0
he is very important in the balance of our team			0
our team was developed with @entity0 in that position and everybody feels comfortable with him there			2
' @entity90 did amazingly well for us in those two games , in that position , but @entity90 is a central defender and will always sbe a central defender , while @entity0 is @entity0 and the team feels very good with him			2
