spreading the love : calling the move their spring offensive , saturday night 's protest was timed with the six - month anniversary peace versus police : though the protesters have come and gone in waves since the initial stand off , @entity7 has been the hub of the movement 's activity within @entity10 as they have in past marches , protesters led police on a series of cat - and - mouse chases			1

' @entity5 did some terrible things , especially @entity312 , but all of them			0
everyone from the banks to the rating agencies , they all knew they were doing wrong			0
... but they did it anyway			0

dressed in an outfit that might have been more appropriate for the @entity325 , the 61 - year - old salesman wore a green shamrock cap and carried a sign asking for saintly intervention : ' @entity329 : drive the snakes out of @entity5			0
' @entity331 @entity5 : earlier in the day , protesters chalked @entity334 - inspired phrases in @entity7 @entity335 held up a cardboard sign that read , ' @entity337 is coming , ' a reference , she said , both to the @entity151 and to the warm weather that is returning to @entity10			1
she said she believes the nicer weather will bring the crowds back to occupy protests , where numbers have dwindled in recent months since the group 's encampment was ousted from @entity7 by authorities in november			1

' the next couple of months , things are going to start to grow , like the flowers			0
' some have questioned whether the group can regain its momentum			0
this month , the finance accounting group in @entity10 reported that just about $ 119,000 remained in @entity5 's bank account - the equivalent of about two weeks ' worth of expenses			1
