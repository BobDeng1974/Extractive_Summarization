@entity6 had managed to crawl backwards through a gap in the cot at her home in @entity10 , @entity11 , but was left hanging mid air by her neck			1
the furniture boss who supplied the beds , @entity13 , who was described as the ' king of @entity16 ' was today fined £ 50,000 and given a suspended prison sentence			1
@entity6 managed to crawl backwards out of her cot and get trapped between the horizontal handrail the 19 - month - old was left dangling mid air by her neck and was only saved because her mother had been watching her on the baby monitor the 19 - month - old was only saved when her mother , @entity22 , happened to be watching the incident unfold on a baby monitor			1
days later a second toddler was found dangling from the £ 450 bed with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail			1
both mothers had purchased the @entity31 three - drawer cotbeds from @entity33 's company , @entity32 , which had the beds produced in @entity35 and imported back into @entity36 for distribution			2
@entity38 heard mrs @entity6 had put @entity6 in the cotbed for her lunchtime sleep on april 16 , 2013 , when she saw her getting into difficulty via the video monitoring system			1
she rushed upstairs to find her daughter hanging by her neck , which had become lodged in a gap between the end of the bed and a horizontal handrail			1
judge @entity48 told @entity13 : ' seeing her daughter on the baby video monitor screen hanging by her neck was , using her words , beyond description and completely traumatic to her			1
' one can only imagine the horror that mother must have felt			2
in her view , it is without doubt the fact she had a video monitor that saved her daughter 's life			2
' she added : ' this is a serious offence because it came through your negligence			0
it could have caused the loss of life of babies			0
' the crown 's case against the company and you was , with your negligence , this unsafe product was put on the market			0
' clearly , you did not act with all due diligence , or take all reasonable precautions to make sure such a situation would not occur			0
' the product itself was dealing with the most vulnerable people in society , and i know that you accept that			0
' @entity22 with her daughter @entity6 today after what she described as a ' traumatic ' experience judge @entity48 said the design of the cot ' could have been fatal ' and added that although @entity13 and the company had been ' naive and negligent ' , there was ' very strong mitigation ' on their behalf			1
nine days after @entity6 's incident , @entity94 , from @entity95 found her son dangling on the outside of the cot with his forehead jammed against the horizontal handrail			1
' it took both her and her mother to lift her son back through the gap , ' said judge @entity48			0
mrs @entity6 complained to @entity104 at @entity105 and officers took away the cotbed before confronting @entity108			2
they were shown a copy of the video of @entity6 and immediately recalled all the cots it had sent out around the country			2
the court was told no health and safety tests were carried out in the @entity36 , with the only quality control being made in the @entity35 factory , which did not comply with @entity36 safety standards			0
following test reports and an offer from @entity13 to give mrs @entity6 a part - refund , @entity108 was served a product recall notice in july 2013 , which recovered 93 per cent of the 212 cotbeds sold			1
the following month @entity104 received three lab test reports which identified failures , including test parameters and clauses relating to strength of certain parts , finger , head and neck entrapment , and @entity136 standards markings			0
@entity137 visited @entity108 in october and seized computer equipment			0
a month later @entity13 was interviewed under caution during which he confirmed the company had designed the @entity141 cotbed , which was produced in @entity35 and imported back into @entity36 for distribution			1
the court heard the prototype had been tested and passed in 2010 but the product placed on the market in 2013 had different dimensions and @entity13 had no proper quality control in this country			2
in mitigation @entity150 told the court neither @entity13 nor @entity108 set out to harm children with their cotbed , and the company accepted that it failed in not having proper quality control			1
she added that the company had acted quickly to remove the product from distribution and done all it could to trace the remaining cots , all of which were accepted by @entity163			0
@entity13 , company director of furniture supplier @entity32 , which distributed the beds , was today given a suspended prison sentence for placing an unsafe product on the market judge @entity48 described this as a serious offence but said the court acknowledged naivety and negligence on the part of the defendant , who at the time had no manufacturing experience , kept no technical product notes , and relied on an external company for testing to assess compliance with relevant @entity182			1
@entity13 , described as ' the king of @entity16 ' on a profile on the @entity108 website , entered pleas on the company 's behalf at an earlier hearing , admitting two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between january 2010 and july 2013			1
the 38 - year - old , of @entity194 , @entity195 , was given a three month prison sentence suspended for 12 months			2
he also pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to his company , which is based near @entity199 , @entity200 , and ordered to pay £ 500 to the two mothers			2
@entity108 was given a £ 12,000 fine and @entity13 and his company also face prosecution costs of £ 35,653			1
judge @entity48 said she felt able to suspend the jail sentence because of his lack of intent to cause injury in supplying the potentially deadly cots to the market			0
she added : ' it is very difficult to put a figure on the clear distress that both these ladies suffered			0
' in a statement read through solicitor @entity216 , @entity13 and @entity108 said they ' sincerely regretted ' any distress caused to the families			2
speaking outside court @entity13 ' solicitor , mr @entity216 , said : ' @entity222 and @entity223 wish to express their sincere regret for any distress caused to the families effected			2
' health and safety remains of paramount concern to mr @entity13 and the company			1
' speaking after the hearing mrs @entity6 said the court case brought an element of closure to the nightmare experience of seeing her daughter trapped by her neck in her cot			1
she said : ' i bought what i thought was the best for @entity6 - a premium quality cot bed			1
but it turned out to be a living hell			0
standards officers @entity244 ( right ) and @entity246 ( left ) examine the @entity31 three - drawer cotbed ' for a long time afterwards it gave me nightmares , and it made me nervous about putting @entity6 to bed			1
' the video monitor definitely saved her life			0
i 'd never have thought to buy one , but a friend suggested it			0
now i 'd urge every parent to consider a video monitor for their child			0
' trading standards officer @entity244 , who led the investigation , said the case demonstrated the department 's commitment to protecting families from products posing a safety risk , and was an example of the tough measures they were prepared to take			0
she said : ' this case highlights the need to be very careful buying online			0
before clicking the " buy " button , make sure you have a manufacturer 's code , product code and full contact details of the retailer , including a cancellation process in case you need to return the product , or there is a safety problem			0
' ms @entity244 added that they believe there are still 12 cotbeds out there that were n't reached during the product recall .			0
