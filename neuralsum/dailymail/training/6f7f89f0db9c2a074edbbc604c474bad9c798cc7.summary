by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 3 january 2013 2012 was the second wettest year in @entity3 history , the @entity1 has revealed today			1
official figures show that 1,330mm ( 52.4 inches ) of rain fell in the past 12 months - just 7mm short of the highest total reached in 2000			1
depressingly this new data also shows that four of the five wettest years ever to hit the @entity3 have been since the millennium			1
bad news : 2012 was the second wettest year on record and experts predict floods like this are even more likely battered @entity3 : @entity14 surrounded by flood water in @entity16 in november 2012 , one of many places to be hit badly by flooding last year the top five wettest years in the records dating back to 1910 are 2000 , 2012 , 1954 , 2008 and 2002			1
it came as @entity1 figures also showed the number of days of extreme rainfall is also hitting record levels , meaning the @entity3 can expect more years of floods			1
the @entity3 as a whole had 15 per cent more rainfall than average during the year , with @entity30 experiencing almost a third more rain than normal			1
overall 2012 was the wettest year on record for @entity30 and the third wettest for @entity34 , but @entity35 experienced only its 17th wettest year and in @entity36 it was the 40th wettest			1
1954 – 1309.1 mm 4			0
2002 – 1283.7mm almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded last year as the @entity3 was repeatedly battered by heavy rain , storms and floods			1
but 2012 began with a number of water companies imposing hosepipe bans as swathes of @entity30 faced drought following two dry winters			1
the dry weather then gave way to persistent rain , with the @entity3 experiencing a record april and june , and the wettest summer in a @entity53 ’ crops were hit by the unusually wet summer , while much of the @entity3 ’s wildlife struggled in the poor conditions , with only a few species including slugs and orchids thriving			2
the @entity1 said changes in sea surface temperatures as a result of natural cycles and a reduction in the amount of @entity67 sea ice could be helping to increase rainfall , but more research needed to be done to establish how big a role they were playing			2
same as last year then : today only part of a road can be seen above the flood water from the @entity75 near @entity76 , @entity77 sodden : only the speed limit signs from a submerged @entity77 road show the aftermath of the @entity75 bursting its banks serene : beautiful weather masks the fact that persistent heavy rain over recent weeks means this area has been completely flooded long - term averages over 30 - year periods show an increase in annual rainfall of about five per cent from 1981 - 2010 when compared to 1961 - 1990			2
it has also been revealed that torrential rain heavy enough to cause flash flooding is on the rise and climate change is probably the cause , a different @entity1 study looking at the last 50 years of figures has revealed today			1
official statistics show during the 1960s the heaviest rains of the year fell on an average of one in 125 days a year , but now it is closer to one in 75 days			2
extreme rain : this graph shows that since the 1960s there has been more and more days of torrential rain a year in @entity3 @entity109 spots : this map of @entity3 shows where the the highest levels of torrential rain in 24 hours tends to fall the @entity1 's chief scientist @entity114 says that the frequency of extreme rainfall events in the @entity3 looks to be increasing			1
' what this data is telling us is that the nature of our rainfall is changing and what we are seeing is more intense rain , more regularly , ' she told @entity124			2
' there ’s evidence we are getting slightly more rain in total , but more importantly it may be falling in more intense bursts – which can increase the risk of flooding , ' she said			0
' what this means is that when it raining there is more potential for more flash floods and surface water floods , like the ones we have seen this year			2
this means we have to look at the strength of our flood defences and also our drainage systems , including the use of more permeable surfaces			0
' heavy : warm air allows clouds to pick up more moisture , the @entity1 says , as this picture of @entity149 's skyline shows during one of many heavy rainstorms in the last year torrent : the @entity153 launch their boat in @entity16 in may , in floods often caused by sheer volume of rain rising temperatures are being blamed as for every 0.7 degrees the global temperatures rises , clouds can hold four per cent more rain , the @entity1 has said			1
' the data we have bears out that warmer air holds more water , ' @entity114 said			0
@entity167 head of policy @entity168 said climate change was already affecting the @entity3			0
' four of the five wettest years in the @entity3 have occurred since 2000 , and experts including the @entity1 expect extreme weather events such as intense rainfall to become more common as global warming takes hold			1
' there is still time to tackle climate change			0
we must end our dependency on dirty fossil fuels and reap the benefits of energy efficiency and developing clean power from the wind , waves and sun. ' typical scene : waves crash into the sea wall at @entity190 as the @entity3 was battered by rain and wind in 2012 dumped : increasing amounts of heavy downpours are happening , and being predicted for the future - like this one over @entity196 the @entity197 ( @entity197 ) warned that despite the wet year , there was a need for a coherent strategy to manage water resources to cope with drought as well as floods , including creating new storage facilities to catch rainfall			1
@entity197 water expert @entity206 said : ' without a strategy , we will continue to swing from flooding to drought and climate change will only exacerbate the situation			0
' developing new storage facilities across the country to harvest more rainfall must form part of this strategy - rainfall is becoming more varied in terms of time and place and we can no longer rely on large reservoirs in only a few locations			0
' it appears that in the long term , with a mix of years of high rainfall and years of drought			0
but the overall trend shows that there has been consistently more heavy rain in the last 50 years			1
in the early 1970s there were as few as one in 155 days of the heaviest rainfall , while in in 2000 - the wettest year on record , there were torrential downpours on one in 60 days			1
gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and buttercups gardeners have been warned to forget about creating the perfect @entity30 lawn , with changing weather patterns making it virtually impossible to plan the perfect garden			2
experts fear that summers will become more prone to extreme weather conditions , with torrential rain and prolonged droughts becoming the norm			2
gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and daffodils on their lawn as a result			0
drier springs and wetter summers will mean that flowers will also struggle to cultivate in beds and borders			0
@entity1 experts made the predictions at a recent @entity265			0
retire @entity267 professor @entity266 , an expert in turf management and garden history , said : ' my own view is that climate change wo n't affect gardens dramatically but the weather will			0
' nobody can tell one year to the next what we will have			0
' in terms of grass , i would say to a large extent that the less effort you put in the better			0
people should accept a higher cut of grass , more daisies and buttercups			0

1,330mm of rain fell in the last year - 7mm less than in 2000
four of five wettest years in @entity3 have been in last 12 years
2012 was the wettest year ever for @entity30 but not other home nations
number of days of torrential rain also up over last 50 years
@entity3 can expect more floods , @entity1 chief scientist tells @entity124
