the first piece was found on the streets of the @entity18 neighborhood in @entity19			0

’ the work , called ‘ the street is in play ’ , was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting			0
the audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically : ‘ before you , you will see a spray art by the artist @entity3			2
it 's probably been painted over by now			0
’ it also said that the ‘ children represent youth ’ and the ‘ sign represents , well , signs			2
’ but within hours of its whereabouts being announced , the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti but no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced , first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read : ' sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life ! ' a second piece of art was then uncovered in the @entity68 neighborhood underneath the @entity70 tourist attraction			1
the white , spray - painted text read : ‘ this is my @entity8 accent ’ in a traditional graffiti font , while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font : ‘ … normally i write like this			1
’ but that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it			0
@entity3 , a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of @entity84 , @entity85 and whose real identity is unknown , has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world , known for his trademark spray - paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary			2
a second @entity3 piece was uncovered in the @entity68 neighborhood of @entity8 underneath the @entity70 tourist attraction the artist appeared in and directed the 2010 @entity96 - nominated documentary ' @entity97 ' with his face and voice obscured			2
earlier this year , two spray - painted murals by @entity3 were pulled from an auction in @entity102 , including one entitled ' @entity103 , ' after questions arose about the ownership of the works and how the auction house obtained them			1
' @entity103 ' eventually sold at a private auction in @entity110 for $ 1.1 million in june			0
another @entity3 mural , the ' @entity112 ' found painted on the wall of a @entity115 gas station in 2008 , is up for auction in december in @entity117 , and estimated to fetch between $ 150,000 and $ 300,000			0
