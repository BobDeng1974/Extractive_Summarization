by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 02:23 est , 15 may 2012 it is a central @entity2 pied - a - terre with a price tag that only the world 's richest can afford to pay			1
a lavish apartment at the @entity7 development one @entity8 has come up for sale - one of only a handful of properties in the billionaire - friendly block to reach the open market - and it could be yours for a cool £ 65m			1
the five - bedroom flat , described on property finding website zoopla.co.uk as ' exceptional ' , has magnificent panoramic views of @entity8 and @entity20 and has been fitted out to the highest specifications			1
apartment @entity22 , marketed by luxury estate agents @entity24 , appeared on zoopla four days ago and is already attracting a flurry of interest			0
in the literature , the apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of ' @entity30 ' , on the 8th floor , enjoying some of the city 's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property			1
@entity36 : the spacious living areas have views across @entity8 on one side and across @entity20 and beyond on the other opulent : the luxury sitting room has been created by the @entity7 interior design team in addition to the five bedrooms , there are six bathrooms and three extensive reception areas			1
' the interior design of @entity51 responds both to its unique size of over 9,000 sq ft as well as its extraordinary location , ' the description reads			0
it goes on to detail how the apartment is divided into two wings , with five bedrooms found in the city wing , and all living and entertaining spaces found in the park wing			0
an ' impressive ' 65m hallway stretches from the park side to the city side , connecting both wings and forming the so - called ' spine ' of the apartment			0
the apartment was decorated by the @entity7 interior design team and is said to have taken inspiration from ' the two diverse perspectives of @entity2 , which uniquely combine in this apartment , to provide a truly modern interpretation of sophisticated and luxurious city living			2
' the property has reportedly already attracted a number of interested parties from across the globe since going up on @entity79 's website at the end of last week			0
when contacted , @entity24 preferred not to comment on the sale of the property , saying only that they had received a number of inquiries			0
they would not be drawn on the price , nor on the apartment 's potential to be sold for more or less than the asking price			0
airy : the 8th floor living space has views over the treetops of @entity2 's @entity8 comfort : with three reception rooms , there is no shortage of places for the eventual buyer of the apartment to entertain they would say only that it is ' early days ' for the sale of the property , and that they were expecting ' a lot of interest '			1
but while there will be many eager to catch a glimpse of the interior of the opulent development , industry insiders told @entity110 that there will likely be some system in place at @entity24 to prevent the curious carpet - treader from gaining entry just to have a look around			0
agencies who have previously represented properties at one @entity8 agencies have requested proof that any interested party should be able to afford the purchase of the property			2
it is likely that @entity24 will use a similar system			0
' other agencies who 've marketed properties in the building have demanded financial paperwork to stop rubber - neckers getting in			0
there are so many people who just want to have a look but have no intention of buying , and the other residents at the development are incredibly private people , and some of the world 's wealthiest , ' they told us			2
while they refused to confirm details , @entity24 agreed they would be likely to operate some sort of system to ensure that only those with the means to live in one @entity8 would be shown around the property			2
the buyer will join a roll call of billionaire residents , including developer @entity7 , who owns two properties at one @entity8			1
the property tycoon , who built the apartments with his brother @entity152 , owns two separate flats worth £ 31m and £ 26.2m on the 10th floor			2
two other apartments were sold for a combined £ 136 million to @entity158 mining tycoon @entity156 , who is thought to be investing a further £ 50 million to knock the properties together and refit them			0
despite being owned by some of the richest people in the world , the flats qualify for lower council tax than people living in an average @entity167 property because @entity168 has one of the lowest property valuations in the country			1
indeed , with many of the buyers never intending to live at the address , it was reported last year that just nine out of the 62 flats sold in one @entity8 - the world 's most expensive residential block - had been registered for council tax			1
council records revealed last year that only four owners in the block were paying the full council tax of £ 755.60 a year , plus £ 619.64 to the @entity183			1
a further five were reported to be paying the 50 per cent discounted council tax owed on a second home , making a considerable saving that will no doubt boost their already impressive wealth			2
but with so many of the building 's residents based elsewhere , the place has earned something of a reputation as a ghost town			0
subtle decor : the interior of the flat is done in muted tones one of the five bedrooms , with stunning views across @entity20 luxurious : the flat is one of the first to make it to the open market , and the first time the curious virtual carpet - treader has been afforded such an extensive glimpse inside the property prime spot : the development has panoramic views across @entity8 and @entity212 one @entity8 's developers , brothers @entity152 and @entity215 , outside the development at its launch in january last year , and right , he glass - fronted exterior of one @entity8 for sale : the property has appeared on the website of luxury estate agents @entity24 visit zoopla.co.uk to view the one @entity8 apartment + see below for @entity7 's teaser , showing what life inside one @entity8 could be like ...			1
