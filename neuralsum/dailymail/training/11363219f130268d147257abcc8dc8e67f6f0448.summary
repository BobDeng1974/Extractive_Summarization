@entity4 opposes same - sex marriage , warning it would ‘ risk the grave harm of undermining the rights of @entity32 and @entity33 to decide for themselves who they will and will not marry ’			2
but after being ousted , mr @entity21 said : ‘ on gay marriage the party is on the wrong side of public opinion and the wrong side of history			0
