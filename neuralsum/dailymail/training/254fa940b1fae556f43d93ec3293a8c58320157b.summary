nutty : sneezy the squirrel is so tame she lets @entity4 student @entity3 dress her up in a range of fetching hats a university student has struck up an incredible relationship with a tiny squirrel named @entity10 - who lets her dress it up in a range of eye catching hats			1
animal - loving @entity3 , 18 , started feeding peanuts to the squirrels on her campus at @entity4 in @entity19 , @entity20 , at the beginning of the school year			1
over time she noticed they were becoming more friendly and inching closer to her - with one in particular comfortable enough to eat straight from her hand			2
and as the level of trust between the pair continued to grow @entity3 decided that simply stroking the squirrel was no longer enough - so she began placing miniature hats on her new friend			1
she said : ' one day i was sitting under a tree and some kids nearby were feeding a group of squirrels and they were n't running away - so i decided to try the same thing			2
' they got friendlier and friendlier , particularly @entity39 , but i honestly do n't know what inspired me to put hats on her - i just wanted to see what i could do as it was funny			1
' i had a tiny doll hat with me and tried it			2
amazingly she sat there with it on long enough for me to take a picture			0
' then i started making different hats including a special birthday hat as it was my grandmother 's birthday so i sent her a picture which she loved			2
' ms @entity3 makes most of the hats herself - with some simply computer print outs that she folds up			1
others she finds at craft stores			0
she said she had , had lots of positive reaction to the pictures so far			0
' everyone in town and on campus loves it , ' she said			0

' @entity10 is so popular with students at @entity4 he now has his own @entity69 page , which has been liked by nearly 6,500 people			1
close : ms @entity3 , 18 , has struck up a remarkable relationship with @entity10 since befriending him the page features a selection of pictures of the squirrel in various costumes , under the caption ' a friendly little squirrel who wears hats to brighten up your day ! ' squirrels are naturally inquisitive animals with those who live close to , or among humans , sometimes prepared to approach them for food			1
the animals have very accurate spatial memories - used to a large degree to remember where they have buried caches of nuts			0
squirrels have even been known to pretend to bury nuts if they feel they are being watched by a rival			0
they do this by digging a hole and miming the placement of the nut , while actually keeping it in their mouths			0
they need to be quick witted to avoid a wide range of predators including humans , hawks , weasels , raccoons , and cats			0
squirrels belong to a large family of rodents called the @entity139			0
this includes a wide range of species , such as tree squirrels , ground squirrels , chipmunks , marmots , flying squirrels , and prairie dogs			0
squirrels are indigenous to the @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity151 , and have been introduced to @entity152			0
the introduction of grey squirrels to @entity155 has been blamed by conservationists for causing a steep decline in the country 's native red squirrel population			2
