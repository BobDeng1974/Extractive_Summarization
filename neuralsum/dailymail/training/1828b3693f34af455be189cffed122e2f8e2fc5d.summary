by @entity0 & @entity1 @entity2 said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish would be difficult and time consuming restaurants , cafés and schools are being forced by the @entity9 to identify and list 14 potential allergens in their food			1
@entity2 , the renowned cook and tv food expert , condemned the changes as a ‘ bureaucratic nightmare ’ that make life very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘ dish of the day ’			1
the law comes into effect later this year and will fundamentally change the way all food is sold in supermarkets , restaurants , office canteens and schools			1
anyone selling food will be required to label allergens under one of 14 headings – ranging from gluten to soya , milk and mustard to sesame , lupin and sulphur dioxide			2
however , while this might be a simple task for the big brand chains who have a limited range of standard items , like @entity46 ’s and @entity47 , it will be an enormous burden for independents who change their dishes based on the fresh ingredients that are available			1
the new rules are designed to protect the estimated 21 million @entity52 who claim to have food allergies and will be policed by council trading standards officers , who can bring prosecutions and fines			1
miss @entity2 said the bureaucracy involved in going through the ingredient in every new dish to decide whether it includes one of the 14 allergens would be difficult and time consuming			1
‘ my worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market , ’ she said			1
‘ fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has , but for proper cooks - a nightmare			1
’ the chairman of the @entity80 , the 7th @entity81 and runs porters in @entity83 , said : ‘ it is typical of the heavy - handedness of the @entity9 to bring in something like this			2
‘ it is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with			0
‘ it is well intentioned , obviously , and all restaurants want to protect their customers from harm , but this is just so complicated			0
the labelling will be easy for huge corporations like @entity47 and @entity46 's to comply with because they have limited menus ‘ you have to audit every menu item , but also , if you buy in sauces , for example , you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them , which is difficult and complicated			1
’ he said staff in his two restaurants are trained to offer advice on allergens , but he said : ‘ if we are required to print all the details on the menus , they will become an absolute travesty			0
‘ what people who have allergies need to do is to alert the staff when they visit a restaurant			2
if the staff are trained properly , they will then be able to explain which dishes they will have a problem with , ’ he said			0
restaurants will be required either to provide information sheets or chalk boards listing the allergen contents of each dish , or to have members of staff who are trained to provide the information dish by dish			0
the changes also present huge challenges to catering companies and the nation ’s school chefs , who are struggling to cope with the implementation of the new free school meals for the youngest primary school age children			0
@entity138 , the head of customer marketing at @entity140 , a foodservice wholesale distributor , said that there had been little discussion in the education sector around the changes , which form part of the @entity146 and come into force on december 13			0
‘ that will require any caterer effectively to provide information about the allergy implications of every dish on every menu , ’ she said			2
‘ if things change , if the recipes change or substitutions come in they ’ll need all the right processes , back of house to be able to make sure that that information ’s up to date			1
it ’s actually quite a lot to take on board			0
tree nuts ( such as walnut , hazelnut , almond etc. ) 8			0
sulphur dioxide ‘ it ’s a lot of work with understanding the allergens behind each dish , understanding the processes behind that , making sure there ’s information available for front and back of house teams about what allergens sit in what dishes , doing all the kitchen audits to make sure that there ’s no risk of contamination			2
’ she added : ‘ there does n’t appear to be very much useful research anywhere that allows us to understand what are the incidents of multiple allergies – how many children have allergies across all the 14 allergens			0
do we just come up with a totally allergy free recipe or do you focus on egg , dairy , nuts ? ‘ that ’s a real challenge for us all if we ’re developing recipes			0
’ the penalties for serving food containing ingredients that include allergens without making this clear to customers can be severe , even under the current law			0
in may last year , @entity218 ’s @entity217 restaurant was fined £ 8,500 after it served pasta to a coeliac after she requested a gluten free meal			0
@entity52 ’s @entity222 described the new allergen labelling rules as ‘ good news for consumers ’			1
it said : ‘ the new regulation brings @entity9 rules on general and nutrition labelling together into a single regulation to simplify and consolidate existing labelling legislation and applies in all member states			2
‘ these changes will provide allergen information in a clearer and more consistent way ; making it easier for people to make safer food choices when buying food			1

@entity2 described the changes as a ‘ bureaucratic nightmare '
new rules easy for @entity46 's and @entity47 but difficult for smaller eateries who change menu daily
@entity222 : ' it will be easier for people to make safer food choices when buying food ' !
