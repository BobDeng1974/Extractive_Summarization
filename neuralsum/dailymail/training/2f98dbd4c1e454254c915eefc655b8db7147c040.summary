he added that it was clear from their conversation they were among the intelligence community			0
@entity9 said the conversation initially centered around the event the men had just attended but soon turned to the @entity3 leaks , which were first reported by @entity32 reporter @entity31			1
the term ' disappeared ' refers to a secret murder or assassination carried out by dictatorship governments			0
@entity9 described the discussion on @entity49 as ' bravado ' and said he believed the disappearing comment was ' half joke half serious			2
' ' they were loud			0
lacked circumspection about comments & jokes , ' he wrote about the conversation in the busy airport lounge			0
defensive : director of national intelligence @entity61 said in a statement saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were ' reckless ' @entity9 said he did n't know the identities of the officials or which agency they worked for			1
he wrote on twitter that he recorded part of the conversation and took a number of poor quality photos , which he said he would post online			0
' was a shock to me and was n't prepared , ' he tweeted			0
the dinner was in honor of former @entity3 director @entity79 and chaired by former ambassador @entity80			2
the news comes after director of national intelligence @entity61 responded on saturday to the defended the classified government surveillance programs that were leaked during the week , insisting the measures kept @entity19 safe and were ' authorized by @entity84 '			1
hoping to ' dispel some of the myths ' after leaked documents published by @entity32 and the @entity87 shed light on two top - secret government surveillance programs , @entity61 said in a statement the purpose of the programs is ' to obtain foreign intelligence information , including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the @entity19 and its allies '			1
the classified document , published by @entity32 , detailed how a division of @entity100 was ordered to give cell phone records to the @entity3			1
the @entity32 and the @entity87 also reported that another program , called ' prism ' , was used by @entity19 intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top @entity108 companies like @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
in statements , those companies denied providing the government with special access to their files			0
@entity117 : the director of national intelligence @entity61 , left , released a statement on @entity103 , which is reported to have been used to gather information from the data centers of @entity108 companies like @entity111 , one of which is pictured left ' necessary ' : the top intelligence official , @entity61 , said the @entity3 's intelligence measures , carried out at sites like this one in @entity127 , were ' used to keep @entity19 safe ' both the phone - records program and @entity103 were approved by a judge , but @entity103 allowed government agencies to gain access to various internet conversations , including email			1
in his statement , @entity61 said @entity103 , which was authorized in the @entity135 , has been in place since 2008			2
the @entity137 reported on saturday that earlier this week the @entity3 filed a criminal report with the @entity139 in relation to the leaks			1
@entity61 called the disclosures ' reckless '			2
' in a rush to publish , media outlets have not given the full context – including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government – to these effective tools , ' he said			0
' in particular , the surveillance activities published in @entity32 and the @entity87 are lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed , and fully debated and authorized by @entity84			1
' @entity61 's statement came as a new @entity32 report revealed more information on the @entity3 's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence			1
documents obtained by the @entity32 reveal the government uses a data mining tool , called @entity162 , to map information the agency collects			2
the @entity32 reported the agency collected ' almost 3 billion pieces of intelligence from @entity19 computer networks over a 30 - day period ending in march 2013 '			1
national security : top intelligence official @entity61 said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are ' necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the @entity19 and its allies ' ' the tool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collections against that country , ' according to an @entity3 fact sheet about the program obtained by @entity32			1
in his statement , @entity61 said the agency is limited in discussing their intelligence gathering practices by the @entity3 's need to protect their methods and sources			1
' disclosing information about the specific methods the government uses to collect communications can obviously give our enemies a " playbook " of how to avoid detection , ' @entity61 said			2
@entity61 added the recent disclosures have caused ' significant misimpressions ' , adding he could not correct all ' inaccuracies ' without revealing even more classified information			2
in order to ' dispel some of the myths ' , the @entity3 also released a three - page fact sheet on intelligence collection as outlined by the @entity206			1
the fact sheet noted the government ' does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of @entity19 electronic communication service providers ' but only through court approval with provider 's knowledge			2
@entity84 also authorized the use of @entity103 , which the fact sheet called an ' internal government computer system ' and ' not an undisclosed collection or data mining program '			0
the fact sheet also tried to dispel many @entity19 ' concerns , noting the government can not target anyone 's computer or phone records without ' an appropriate , and documented , foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition ( such as for the prevention of terrorism , hostile cyber activities , or nuclear proliferation ) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the @entity19			1
the fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government			0
' finally , the notion that @entity241 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect			0
collection of intelligence information under @entity241 is subject to an extensive oversight regime , incorporating reviews by the @entity249 , @entity250 and judicial branches , ' the fact sheet said			0
in the fact sheet , @entity61 also highlighted how intelligence gathered using these programs has provided ' insight into terrorist networks and plans '			1
' for example , the intelligence community acquired information on a terrorist organization 's strategic planning efforts , ' he said in the fact sheet			2
' communications collected under @entity241 have yielded intelligence regarding proliferation networks and have directly and significantly contributed to successful operations to impede the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies			0
' president @entity271 also noted the importance of the intelligence programs in an event in @entity275 friday			0
' i came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs , ' he said according to multiple reports			0
' my team evaluated them			0
we scrubbed them thoroughly – we actually expanded some of the oversight , increased some of the safeguards			0
but my assessment and my team 's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks			0
you ca n't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience			0
we 're going have to make some choices as a society			0
