for most people reaching a weight loss goal is an excuse for a celebratory night out , a spa day , or maybe even a new wardrobe			1
but for one brave mother - of - two losing nearly 8st meant she was finally able to take part in her dream charity event : a daring sky dive			1
@entity9 , 28 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , weighed more than 18st when she applied to a do a skydive to fundraise for the @entity13 after her grandmother died of the disease			1
@entity9 slimmed down from 18st ( left ) to a trim 10st 4lb ( left ) through a meal replacement diet at her largest @entity19 was forced to sit on the sidelines at a theme park as she was too large to fit on any of the rides but after realising that her large frame meant she 'd never be able to do the jump , @entity23 was spurred into losing 7st 12lb and slimming down to a size 10			1
@entity23 said : ' i was distraught when i found out that i was too big to do the jump - i knew i had to do something			0
' now i 'm down to a healthy weight i feel so much better , and it 's meant i 've finally been able to raise money with my skydive			1
' shop assistant @entity23 spent years struggling with her weight and used to gorge on takeaways for lunch and dinner			1
@entity23 's impressive weight loss was spurred on by her desire to complete a skydive for the @entity13 ( pictured left holding her skydive certificate and right , in cream , heading to the plane ) @entity23 struggled with comfort eating and despite trying many fad diets , saw her weight continue to creep up prior to finding out she was over the maximum weight for the skydive @entity23 had already been on the receiving end of an embarrassing confrontation with a ride operator at a theme park			1
while queueing for a ride on a day trip with friends , the attendant approached her to say that she would not be able to fit into the seats			2
mortified , @entity23 had to stand aside and wait while her friends whizzed around on rollercoaster after rollercoaster			0
breakfast : nothing lunch : sausages and cheesy chips or a @entity66 snacks : creamy soup with six slices of bread with butter and two packets of crisps			0
dinner : takeaway : @entity76 or pizza			0
plus leftovers from daughter 's meals			0
evening snack : cheese on toast breakfast : @entity85 or porridge lunch : chicken salad and an apple or an orange with a yoghurt			0
dinner : a @entity94 recipe for example : 400 calorie toad in the hole , low fat @entity98 con carne , healthy lasagne			0
snacks : nothing after applying for the skydive and realising there was no chance of her size 22 body fitting into the jumpsuits @entity23 began a radical diet in a bid to finally slim down			1
she chose the rather drastic method of using meal replacement soups and shakes from the @entity94 and managed to slim to a size 10 , now weighing 10st 4lb			1
succeeding in her weight loss meant she was finally able to do her charitysky dive , raising £ 450 for the @entity13			1
@entity23 said : ' every time my weight came to be a problem i pushed it aside and hoped it would disappear			2
@entity23 , pictured here before and after she embarked on the diet , says her weight loss has dramatically increased her energy levels ' but after i looked into doing a skydive and realised i 'd be too big i could n't do it anymore			2
' the @entity13 is a charity really close to my heart and it was awful when i found out there was n't anything i could do			1
' i was exhausted , with two children under two , and i was carrying loads of extra weight , ' it was affecting my kids because i was n't able to play with them as energetically as i used to			2
' i was just too tired to be a good mum and even my husband @entity137 had noticed the difference in me			0
' i was comfort eating after my grandmother 's death , finishing the kids ' leftovers , and before i knew it the weight has just piled on			2
' i never knew when to stop and when was enough			0
' i wanted to be a happy and so i took action and turned my diet , and my life , around			0
' when i look back at pictures now it 's crazy to see how big i was			0
' now it 's such a great feeling knowing that my weight will never hold me back and i can wear whatever i want			0
