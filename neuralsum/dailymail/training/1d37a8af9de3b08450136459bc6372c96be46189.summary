@entity0 are set to sign @entity1 after opening talks with @entity3 over a £ 30million deal for the @entity6 striker			1
both clubs confirmed on tuesday that negotiations are under way , although a transfer fee and personal terms have yet to be agreed			1
@entity3 are demanding £ 25m up front plus £ 5m in add - ons , and @entity1 wants to double his earnings to £ 120,000 a week			1
although the 26 - year - old is at a training camp in @entity18 preparing for the @entity19 , his representatives were discussing terms with the @entity22 champions on tuesday night			1
@entity3 striker @entity1 is closing in on a january move to champions @entity0 the @entity6 international has scored more @entity22 goals ( 20 ) than any other player in 2014 @entity1 - 20 @entity27 - 16 @entity28 - 14 @entity29 - 14 @entity30 - 13 @entity31 - 13 city must ensure that any deal falls in line with the financial limitations imposed on them by @entity36 for breaching financial fair play rules			1
@entity38 would also have to cut one foreign player from his @entity41 squad if he wants to register @entity1 for next month ’s tie with @entity43			1
but @entity38 realised he needs a fourth senior striker after seeing @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity45 all sidelined by injury last month			1
speaking during a press conference on @entity49 , the city manager said : ' i think that is just one of the 20 or 30 names i have read from the beginning of the season until today that we are [ supposedly ] interested in			2
@entity1 holds off @entity56 ( left ) during a @entity22 match against @entity58 in december injuries to players including @entity27 ( left ) , @entity28 and @entity45 have left @entity0 short up front 2006 - 2008 : @entity62 2007 - 2008 : @entity63 ( loan ) 2008 - 2011 : @entity65 ( 59 apps , 22 gls ) 2011 - 2013 : @entity67 ( 65 , 46 ) 2013 - now : @entity3 ( 54 , 25 ) 2010 - now : @entity6 ( 32 , 11 ) ' i do n't think we are going to be too busy in this window			1
we have restrictions about the amount of money and about the number of players we can put in the @entity41 , so i do n't think it will be a special transfer window for our team			2
' the potential move for @entity1 , who is also a target for @entity80 , would be against @entity3 manager @entity82 's wishes after he stated on monday that he hoped no players would leave the @entity84 in january			1
asked whether he was expecting phone calls from clubs enquiring about @entity1 , @entity82 said : ' i hope not			1
i ca n't afford to lose players			2
' we have n't got a big squad as it is but what we do have is quality			0
i am looking to add , i 'm not looking to lose any players			0
' @entity1 is expected to be absent for several weeks as he takes part in the @entity19 during january @entity0 's interest is unsurprising since @entity1 scored more @entity22 goals than any other player during the 2014 calendar year - racking up 20 strikes to place him above @entity0 's leading scorer @entity27 ( 16 ) , while @entity29 and @entity28 netted 14 apiece			1
however , speaking to @entity100 in january after netting his 18th goal in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity103 , @entity1 said : ' i really do n't care about statistics			1
' the 26 - year - old insists he is more concerned with achieving personal ambitions while dismissing the perception that he is an easy - going guy			2
' i have to be in control , ' he said			0
' i am a hard person - i am not an easy guy			2
i want always to be in control , everything i do in football and outside			0
at the end of the season i want to do this , after next season i want to do that			0
i know who can help me , who ca n't help me			0
the people who can help , from the beginning i talk to them : " i want that and that - you have to help me			2
and if you help me , i help you			0
" @entity3 manager @entity82 ( right ) had previously said he hoped @entity1 would not be leaving in january ' i like to use my power			1
wherever we go , in the disco or anywhere , i am always talking about this every day			0
' i always tell my friends - @entity135 , ( @entity31 ) @entity136 , @entity137 - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know i am good with my head			2
you do n't have to be in the box , give me the ball			0
' if i head the ball one time it can be a goal			0
i try to be there in the right place			0
if i am not there , it is my mistake			0
' @entity153 texts me to say : " do n't let anyone destroy your objectives			0
