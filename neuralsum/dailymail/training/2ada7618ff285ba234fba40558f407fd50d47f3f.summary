by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 10:34 est , 30 january 2014 our teenage years are among the most awkward and self - conscious of our lives , and now scientists may have discovered why			0
researchers from @entity6 used mri scans to establish that feelings of embarrassment , awkwardness , and self - awareness are linked to a specific brain response that develops , and peaks , during adolescence			1
this region directly connects to the part of the brain that influences actions and behaviours , and could also explain why teenagers are so strongly influenced by peer pressure			1

this explains why adolescent years can be so difficult teenagers are more likely to take risks and are naturally inclined to heightened aggression , casual sex and binge - drinking , according to an @entity36 study			2
the report , carried out by psychologist @entity38 , of @entity39 in @entity40 , supports other research which describes adolescent behaviour as a way for teenagers to cope in a harsh environment			0
professor @entity38 : ' heightened risk - taking during adolescence is likely to be normal , biologically - driven , and , to some extent , inevitable			0
there is probably very little we can or ought to do			0
' the researchers made the discovery while studying the affect social evaluation has on brain activity and emotions			1
@entity57 evaluation is the process of evaluating people based on how they look , act and so on , and being aware of how others evaluate you			1
researchers claim that regions of the brain that develop later in life , such as the medial prefrontal cortex ( @entity69 ) , could play a unique role in the way teens , in particular , monitor this type of social evaluation			1
specifically , the researchers wanted to discover whether something as simple as being watched , or looked at , played a role in social evaluation among young people			1
they were also particularly interested to see how the @entity69 area of the brain in adolescents connected to the striatum - an area of the brain involved with controlling behaviours and action			2
the study involved 69 participants , ranging in age from eight to almost 22 years old			0
each participant was asked to complete tests that gauged emotional , physiological , and neural responses to social evaluation			1
the brain region that affects these emotions directly connects to the part of the brain that influences actions and behaviours			0
researchers claim this could also explain why teenagers are influenced by peer pressure and rely so heavily on social evaluation and approval from their friends , stock image of teenagers pictured researchers told the participants they would be testing a new video camera embedded in to the head coil of a functional @entity112 scanner , however the camera was n’t real			1
the participants watched a screen that told them whether the camera was on , off , or warming up			0
researchers used mri scans , stock image pictured , claim that regions of the brain that develop later in life , such as the medial prefrontal cortex ( @entity69 ) , could play a unique role in social evaluation they were also told that a same - sex peer of approximately the same age would be watching them via a video feed			1
the mri scans revealed that when adolescents thought they were being watched , there was an increase in activity between the @entity69 and striatum			2
adolescents also reported a heightened state of embarrassment and physiological arousal when asked to self - evaluate how the experiment made them feel			2
@entity137 , lead researcher and assistant professor of psychology at the university , said : ‘ our study identifies adolescence as a unique period of the lifespan in which self - conscious emotion , physiological reactivity , and activity in specific brain areas converge and peak in response to being evaluated by others			2
‘ we were concerned about whether simply being looked at was a strong enough ‘ social evaluation ’ to evoke emotional , physiological and neural responses			2
‘ our findings suggest that being watched , and to some extent anticipating being watched , were sufficient to elicit self - conscious emotional responses at each level of measurement			0
’ the findings were published in @entity160 , a journal of the @entity162			0
professor @entity137 and colleagues speculated that the mpfc - striatum pathway may be a route by which social evaluative contexts influence behaviour			0
the link may provide an initial clue as to why teenagers often engage in riskier behaviours when they ’re with their peers .			0

researchers assessed the impact social evaluation has on the brain
@entity57 evaluation is the process of evaluating people based on set criteria
study tracked brain activity when people thought they were being watched
activity in the brain was increased and peaked among adolescents
researchers believe this heightened level of self - awareness causes the increased feelings of embarrassment and awkwardness in teens
it could also explain why young people are more affected by peer pressure
