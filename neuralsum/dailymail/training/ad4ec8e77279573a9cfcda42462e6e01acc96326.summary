@entity0 has urged the @entity1 to build the momentum after launching their @entity4 qualifying campaign with a last - gasp victory in @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s men looked to be heading for a frustrating draw in @entity11 on sunday evening after being pegged back by the @entity7 , only for winger @entity12 to snatch the points with a dramatic late winner			1
they now head into next month ’s double header - on paper , at least , their easiest and most difficult matches , at home to @entity19 and away to reigning world champions @entity21 - brimming with confidence and determined to keep the ball rolling			1
great start : @entity12 celebrates scoring the winning goal against @entity7 bounced back : @entity26 ( left ) and team - mates dejected after @entity7 equalised but the men in green came back to win @entity0 , who won his 97th cap at the @entity32 @entity31 , said : ' look , it ’s momentum , it ’s just a key word			1
@entity9 and the staff have had to wait 10 months for their first competitive game and to get a win is huge			2
' now we can see the way the other results go and build from there			0
but you are coming away from home in the first game , three points - it ’s massive , it really is			2
' it was perfect , very , very perfect			0
it was a huge three points for us			0
people might have been thinking that 1 - 1 would n’t have been too bad , but believe me , we wanted to win this game beforehand			1
' going back to previous campaigns - you look at @entity55 in particular - when you come away , a long - distance travel , tough enough opposition			1
' but ultimately , we knew we could win the game and we did win it			0
we left it a little bit late , but what a special goal to win it for us			0
' @entity0 was one of a procession of players to heap praise on @entity12 after the final whistle , understandably so in the circumstances			1
all to play for : @entity70 's players congratulate @entity12 on scoring his first goal driven : @entity72 takes on @entity7 's @entity73 however , it was not just the fact that he scored the decisive goal which earned him the plaudits , but that he did so to cap arguably the best performance yet of his 70 - game senior international career			1
asked to play on the left in the absence of the injured @entity85 , the @entity82 midfielder looked the man most likely to break down @entity88 ’s men from the off , and so it proved when he accepted @entity92 ’s pass at the end of a swift 24th - minute break and slotted past keeper @entity95			1
but the @entity7 were level seven minutes before the break when midfielder @entity96 thumped a dipping shot past the helpless @entity98 , preferred to 38 - year - old @entity99 in the @entity101 goal , although @entity0 revealed his goalkeeper was unfortunate			2
he said : “ look , it ’s a good strike from the lad , but we probably should n’t have given him as much space			0
it ’s one of those			0
“ it did take a slight deflection - we have had a good look back at the videos - and it went in like an absolute rocket , so that was frustrating			0
” however , @entity12 saved the best for last and as the clock ticked into the 90th minute , he accepted another @entity92 pass , span and curled a delicious winner past substitute keeper @entity119 , sparking mass celebrations both on the field and from the bench as @entity9 and assistant @entity123 were handed the victory they so desperately wanted			1
pride : captain @entity127 leads @entity70 out for their first @entity4 qualifier victory : @entity130 challenges @entity131 for the ball asked if he had ever seen @entity12 produce a display of such quality , @entity0 said : ' to be fair , i have			2
it ’s consistency now he will need to find and maintain that , and more game - time at @entity82 too will help contribute to that			2
' but look , i have played with @entity140 in the @entity101 team for a long , long time and in training up against him too			0
i know the quality he has got , so the more times we can get him on the ball in the final third - less so in our half , where he gives it away for fun ! ' he is a top - drawer player			0
there are not many players in the world have that skill and finish to win the game for you			0

@entity12 's double lead @entity9 's men to a 2 - 1 victory
face @entity19 next month before travelling to world champions @entity21
also in @entity166 with @entity167 and @entity168
the @entity82 winger scored his fourth and fifth international goals in @entity11
@entity174 *defender* @entity26 full of praise for @entity12
also hopes @entity1 have learned their lessons from previous qualifying campaigns
