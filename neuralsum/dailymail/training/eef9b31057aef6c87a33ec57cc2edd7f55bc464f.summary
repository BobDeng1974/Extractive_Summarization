@entity0 could be without midfielder @entity1 for saturday ’s @entity3 clash with @entity4			1
@entity1 has been away on international duty with the @entity6 and is not due back in training until friday			2
that leaves manager @entity9 with a big decision ahead of a crucial game and it may well be that the @entity0 boss decides to rest his star midfielder ahead of tuesday ’s @entity16 visit to @entity17			1
@entity1 is a doubt for @entity0 's clash with @entity4 at the @entity20 on saturday @entity1 , pictured in action for @entity6 against @entity22 , will return to training with @entity0 on friday @entity1 has endured an indifferent season so far and has certainly not played well in @entity0 ’s two @entity16 games , the defeat by @entity27 and the home draw with @entity29			1
however he did score as @entity6 lost 4 - 3 to @entity22 in an @entity32 qualifier earlier this week			0
@entity9 has options if he wishes to leave @entity1 out , with former @entity35 midfielder @entity34 in particularly good form			2
@entity34 ( second from right ) is one of the midfield options available to @entity9 @entity34 scored eight goals against @entity4 during his 13 years with @entity35 , and he hopes to continue that good record this weekend			0
he told @entity0 's official website : ' i ’ve done alright against @entity4 over the years and playing them was always a big game at @entity35			0
' even when i was at @entity45 , @entity4 were big rivals so i ’ve always seen it is a big game and something to mark on the calendar and that does n’t change now i ’m at @entity0			0

@entity1 could miss @entity3 *showdown* with @entity4
midfielder returns to training on friday after international break
@entity9 could rest @entity1 with @entity16 coming up
@entity6 has made an indifferent start to the season for @entity0
