@entity0 never took his eyes off @entity2			1
in @entity5 ’s final training session ahead of the @entity7 derby , the manager was about to make a big call and wanted to gauge the reaction			1
‘ he only found out he was playing on friday , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i was looking at him when i announced it			0
the forward , signed from @entity13 in december 2011 , has continually impressed @entity0 but he wanted to see how the 19 - year - old would fare in his biggest test			1
@entity0 had no hesitation to throw @entity2 in his @entity5 starting line - up against @entity18 @entity2 ( middle ) was outstanding for @entity5 in the @entity7 derby against @entity18 the @entity5 youngster robs @entity22 of the ball during the @entity25 clash he did n’t disappoint			1
if the 192nd collision in the league between these clubs was instantly forgettable at least @entity2 , with his fearless running and boundless enthusiasm on his second @entity25 start , left @entity0 purring about the future			1
loan spells at @entity34 last season and @entity38 in the first half of this campaign gave the @entity39 under 20 international a valuable education but @entity0 recalled @entity2 at the start of january knowing he could contribute to @entity5 ’s push for a top - four spot			1
@entity44 and @entity45 have played 90 minutes together 11 times this season			0
@entity18 are unbeaten in those games			2
@entity2 might have settled this stalemate , as he hit the post from 25 yards			2
‘ maybe i have too much belief in young players , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but you never know until you throw them in			0
' this is a springboard for @entity2 ; to come to @entity56 and play like he did was outstanding			1
you can not say young @entity59 players do n’t have talent			0
’ @entity18 's @entity61 puts in a tackle on @entity2 during the first half at @entity56 @entity2 's heat map , as can be seen in @entity67 's @entity66 feature @entity68 , meanwhile , has insisted @entity69 has not alienated himself from @entity18 ’s squad after he missed a penalty against @entity72 last month , grabbing the ball ahead of regular taker @entity74			1
the @entity18 midfielder has said he will ‘ consider his options ’ at the end of the season			0
‘ i have n’t got an issue , ’ said @entity68			0
‘ it seems like we want to pick on @entity69 because he missed a penalty against @entity72			0
now because he says he wants to leave we are picking on him			0
' i have never had a conversation with @entity69 where he has told me he is not happy			0

@entity18 and @entity5 played out a 0 - 0 draw at @entity56 on *saturday*
in a dire *affair* @entity88 youngster @entity2 gave an impressive showing
it was only his second - ever *competitive* start for the club
@entity0 had no hesitation in starting the 19 - year - old
