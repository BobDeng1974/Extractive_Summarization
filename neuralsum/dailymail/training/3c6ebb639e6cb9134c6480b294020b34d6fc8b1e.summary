by @entity0 while traditional male escort agencies have been around a while , rent a @entity3 is a new offering with a twist ; the men on its books are contractually obligated not to have sexual encounters with clients			1
operating in 12 states from all corners of the @entity16 and gaining fast popularity , the men on the @entity13 a @entity3 books are all deemed handsome , intelligent , and multi-talented , and you can hire them as companions for $ 200 an hour			1
to investigate the @entity13 a @entity3 concept , 32 - year - old writer @entity21 , based in @entity22 , booked @entity24 ; an actor and fitness instructor , for a three hour liaison			1
' he was , without a doubt , a true gentleman , and a naturally amiable , well - educated guy , ' she tells @entity30			1
' he was , without a doubt , a true gentleman , and a naturally amiable , well - educated guy ' @entity24 was n't an easy choice			1
rent a @entity3 boasts men with a staggering range of professional offerings ; from ex pro-football players to professional poker players , international models to @entity46 's ; even teachers , professors and an aerospace engineer			1
@entity51 founder @entity50 tells miss @entity21 that she has women hire men for almost every purpose ; from home - improvements and babysitting to wedding plus - ones and piano lessons			1
in the end , however , given the price tag , miss @entity21 opts for @entity24 and doubles the date up with a one - on - one fitness session at the gym			1
with a serious bout of ' anxiety - induced cottonmouth , ' she met @entity24 dressed in her workout gear at the @entity67 & @entity68 club			2
stretch it out : to get the most bang for her buck , miss @entity21 opted for a personal training session ( pictured ) before she took @entity24 off for cocktails at a nearby bar in an account she penned for @entity76 , miss @entity21 wrote : ' i ’m grateful that @entity24 takes charge from the outset by guiding our conversation and instructing me where to go			0
' he 's done this before , i can tell , and he ’s a natural conversationalist			2
though i ca n’t seem to wipe the stupid girlish smile off my face , his presence puts me at ease			0
' and @entity24 's high - caliber modus operandi comes as no surprise			1
of the thousands of men to audition for a coveted spot on the rent a @entity3 books , only one per cent make it through the stringent screening and interview process			1
within minutes of her appointment , miss @entity21 finds herself shoulders - deep into a sweaty workout			2
' @entity24 is stretching me out on a mat , positioning my body with the authority of an expert , but also with the tenderness of a quasi-boyfriend , ' she writes			0
' in between exercises , we chat casually about our lives			0
' natural flirt : ' @entity24 positions my body with the authority of an expert , but also with the tenderness of a quasi-boyfriend , ' she writes			0
' in between exercises , we chat casually about our lives ' to follow up the session - which miss @entity21 is reluctant to refer to as a ' date ' - the pair enjoyed cocktails at a nearby bar			2
' the predetermined boundaries kept whatever connection existed between us at bay ' ' i was impressed , ' she tells @entity30 , adding that attractive as @entity24 was , it was easy not to fall too hard			0
' there was an underlying flirtatious element to our interactions , but it would be a serious stretch to say that i developed any sort of a crush on the man , ' she explains			0
' the predetermined boundaries kept whatever connection existed between us at bay			0
' when she asked @entity24 just how strict the @entity13 a @entity3 no - sex rules were , he remarked that because all men sign a contract vowing not to sleep with clients , it would be ' foolish , ' to do so , since ' all the power lies with the woman ' to report it to his boss			1
on the books : yours for an hourly rate , ' @entity148 , the professional basketball player ' ( left ) ' @entity147 , the @entity145 lookalike ' ( center ) and ' @entity145 , the globetrotting @entity152 ' ( right ) take your pick : ' @entity161 , the rebel ' ( left ) , ' @entity153 , the @entity154 revolutionary ' ( center ) and ' @entity156 , the wine sommelier and international model ' ( right ) despite anticipations of a very awkward farewell , miss @entity21 was surprised by how she felt walking away from her rent a @entity3 experience			1
' i feel liberated , ' she writes			0
' i do n’t have to worry about whether he ’ll text me within the next few hours , or whether he expects sex the next time i see him			0
overall i feel in control , if a bit broke			0
' ' people spend the equivalent on a host of other mood enhancing services ' and while the $ 200 per hour price tag may sound outrageous to some , miss @entity21 argues that it can actually be worth it , if you keep an open mind			0
' people spend the equivalent on a host of other mood enhancing services ; from therapy to impromptu shopping excursions and yoga classes , ' she tells @entity30			2
' as long as you can keep your head on straight throughout and remember that the experience is not essentially romantic or designed to lead anywhere but the here and now , it 's a healthy way to let loose and have a little fun			2
