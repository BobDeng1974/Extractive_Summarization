@entity0 has lost her court battle to stay in the military home she has remained living in since her airman husband left the ex-wife of an @entity6 squadron leader today lost her human rights court battle to stay in a @entity9 house			1
@entity0 , 46 , had appealed against a @entity11 ruling that she had to leave the property in @entity13 , @entity14			1
if she had won , it would have set a landmark precedent with serious implications for service families and the @entity19			0
but three senior judges unanimously dismissed her case , meaning she must now vacate the three - bedroom house			0
lord @entity26 , sitting with master of the @entity24 and @entity25 , told in their judgement how mrs @entity0 and her squadron leader husband @entity28 had moved into the property together in may 2005			1
but when he left in 2007 , she stayed on			2
the @entity9 served notice on her and in 2010 won a court order that she had to leave the property			1
but she still refused to move out claiming the eviction was against her right to family life under the @entity36			0
her legal team argued that the move was discriminatory and she would be left on the streets as she would not qualify for local authority help if evicted			0
but high court judge mr @entity41 rejected her arguments in 2013 and said she had to go			0
in dismissing her appeal today , @entity44 said the squadron leader had no more than a service tenancy , meaning that , once he had left , the @entity9 was entitled to take back possession			2
the court heard that the @entity9 argued that a threat to the security of tenure for service personnel would interfere with military effectiveness , especially if it prevented rapid redeployment of personnel			2
they claimed it would inhibit them in providing housing for service personnel and require it to rent accommodation locally from the private sector , which would be an unnecessary burden on the public purse			0
the judges agreed that the @entity9 had validly terminated her licence to remain in the property , and there was no breach of her human rights			1
the disputed property - where mrs @entity0 has lived for nearly 10 years - is in this street in @entity13 , near @entity75 , @entity14			1

@entity0 had moved into @entity9 property with airman husband in 2005
but when he left in 2007 , she stayed on in property , *citing* her human rights
*defence* *chiefs* won an order evicting her which was backed by @entity11
the @entity9 *insisted* losing military properties would hit *efficiency* of forces
mrs @entity0 has now lost an appeal and will be moved out of home
