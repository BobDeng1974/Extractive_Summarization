by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 03:31 est , 11 september 2012 the wealthiest man in @entity2 is to sue the country ’s biggest left - wing newspaper for running a front - page picture of him under the headline : ‘ get lost , you rich p * * * k ! ’ liberation ’s attack on @entity12 , 63 , worth around £ 32billion and also @entity14 ’s richest man , came after his decision to seek @entity17 nationality as president @entity18 prepares to introduce a 75 per cent tax rate for the super-wealthy			1
yesterday ’s headline , with a picture of mr @entity12 smiling in front of an overnight travel bag , read : ‘ @entity25 ! ’ tax avoidance : @entity12 has applied for @entity17 nationality news of his intention to quit @entity2 has prompted anger across the country , but mr @entity12 , whose @entity32 luxury - goods group runs companies such as @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , insists his desire to become a @entity17 has nothing to do with avoiding tax			1
he claims he is moving for personal reasons and will continue paying taxes in @entity2			0
but few believe him , and @entity11 was not alone in its attack			2
mr @entity18 , who has openly admitted that he dislikes rich people , said mr @entity46 ' should have reflected on what it means to ask for another nationality , because we are proud to be @entity2 '			1
@entity51 , minister for the @entity52 , also suggested mr @entity12 was unpatriotic saying : ' i expect the @entity2 , especially the richest ones , to be true patriots			1
' leftist politician @entity57 said the country did not need such ‘ parasites ’ and @entity60 lawmaker @entity59 said mr @entity12 was ‘ betraying @entity2 ’s recovery ’			1
but mr @entity12 , who runs luxury goods giant @entity32 – which includes designer brands like @entity34 and @entity36 – said @entity11 had gone too far			1
he is suing the paper for making ' public personal insults ' , with a statement reading : ' @entity12 has no other choice , given the extreme vulgarity and brutality ' of the headline in @entity11 , which is the @entity2 equivalent of @entity73			2
former prime minister of france @entity74 ( left ) said ‘ stupid decisions ’ by the socialist government led by president @entity18 ( right ) had prompted mr @entity12 to become a @entity17 if found guilty liberation will be expected to run a public apology , probably on its front page , although any fine will be nominal			1
politicians from right and left are now accusing mr @entity18 of driving wealth - creating tycoons out of the country to cities like @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 , where they will pay less tax			2
@entity74 , the conservative who stepped down as prime minister of france in may , said ' stupid decisions ' by the @entity96 who replaced his own government had prompted mr @entity12 to become a @entity17			1
mr @entity74 said : ' when you take stupid decisions , you get these terrible results			2
the chief of one of the best companies in the world , who symbolises @entity2 know - how and success , known throughout the world , has been prompted to change his nationality because of the fiscal policy which is being applied in our country			2
' ' if there 's a certain brutality , or vulgarity in @entity11 , it it precisely because of the situation in which we find ourselves			0
' @entity120 despite the row , mr @entity18 insists there will be ' no exceptions ' to his 75 per cent super tax , which with other contributions will see some giving up to 90 per cent of their salaries to the government			0
mr @entity18 said that the tax was ' symbolic ' and would ' set an example ' to everybody else in society			0
the @entity60 president has made no secret of the fact that he sees taxing the rich as the key to revitalising @entity2 's stagnant economy			0
@entity11 used the front page headline as a play on words on a similar insult former conservative president @entity143 used in 2008			0
mr @entity143 , a close personal friend of mr @entity12 , told a man who had been rude to him in a crowd in @entity146 : ' casse - toi , pauvre con '			1
this means ' go away , poor p * * * * ' , with the idea being that the @entity60 were telling multi-billionaires like mr @entity12 ' go away , rich p * * * * '			1
in an editorial linked to their front page , @entity11 made it clear that they were highlighting a nationwide debate about mr @entity18 apparently driving the rich out of @entity2 with his high taxes			0
' it is primarily ironic humour , ' said deputy editor @entity120			0
' if there 's a certain brutality , or vulgarity in @entity11 , it it precisely because of the situation in which we find ourselves			0
