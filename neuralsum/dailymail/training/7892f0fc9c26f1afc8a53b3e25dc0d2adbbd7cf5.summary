more than half of university - aged students have admitted to watching porn to help them find out more about sex			1
some 60 per cent of 2,500 people questioned said they learned more about intercourse by watching scenes online			1
a further 40 per cent questioned said watching porn online helped their understanding of sex - despite three quarters saying that porn provides unrealistic expectations , the research carried out by the @entity10 revealed			1
the majority of university students are getting their sex education from watching porn ( posed by model ) only a third of students said they felt that they could practically apply the knowledge taught in their sex and relationships lessons to real life			1
the same amount also admitted that they did not feel their @entity29 lessons helped their confidence , calling into question whether there needs to be changes made to the curriculum			1
the research found a ' real life ' education is absent in the classroom as @entity29 is treated like a science lesson with puberty , contraception , sexual health , bodies and anatomy listed as the top subjects covered			2
consent was never touched upon for two thirds , with relationships covered for less than half , and a fifth of students say they have not discussed lesbian , gay or transgender relationships in class			0
more than a third felt their @entity29 did not rate positively on equality and diversity			0
psychologist dr @entity60 said there are worrying issues with students using porn as their main source of sex education			1
he added : ' exposure to all aspects of pornography can become addictive , destroy sexually healthy relationships and encourage sexual aggression in both genders			0
' @entity73 is practically ubiquitous and easy fix			0
anonymity and affordability of online sex and hard core pornography has profound potential to create long - term chronically deficient sexual relationships , even among students			2
' despite many students saying that they found porn to be a good source of sex education they also agreed it leaves them with unrealistic expectations he continued : ' it is imperative that @entity29 is fully acceptable by all leading political parties , but more so , that we do not make hasty reactions to one major study			1
' this sensitive issue requires fresh thinking and knows what are the most appropriate questions to ask and replace the full stops by question marks			0
' @entity103 porn can destroy emotional intelligence and other aspects of self identity at a time in student life when 19 - year - old men especially are trying to negotiate their identity through life			2
' @entity10 vice president @entity111 said : ' we now urge all political parties to commit to statutory @entity29 in their general election manifestos , and accept that simple biology just wo n't cut it			1
' @entity116 is not a science lesson			0
people are being left with gaps in their education			2
inadequate @entity29 puts young people at risk			0
i find it alarming that sexual partners are listed as a top @entity29 source by our respondents			2
' consider this in light of the fact that consent was never even raised for two thirds of respondents			0
@entity10 runs consent workshops on campuses across the country , covering a vital aspect of @entity29 that this government misses			1
' the current system almost completely ignores @entity142 relationships			0
in a country where we passed an equal marriage bill , this is the height of hypocrisy			0
' students are having to look outside the education system to find any information that will help them learn more about @entity29 in real life			1
