it was an exit done with a flourish			0
having arrived in @entity3 by @entity4 , the @entity2 took a more direct route home and was picked up from the flight deck of @entity8 by a helicopter			1
smiling broadly as she climbed into the aircraft , the @entity2 , who had just completed a tour of the enormous vessel , was waved out of sight by sailors			0
her majesty travelled down to the @entity18 port early this morning and arrived shortly after the eclipse			0
greeted by sir @entity39 , the lord - lieutenant of @entity18 , the @entity2 stopped to say hello to the waiting crowds before being driven to @entity31 in her official state @entity42 which had been driven down for the occasion			2
the @entity2 is the sponsor of @entity8 , a titanic helicopter carrier that came into service in 1998 and has seen service in the @entity48 and the @entity49 among others			1
@entity8 , which glories in the nickname of ' @entity52 ' within the @entity53 , was also deployed to @entity54 in 2012 to help provide security during the @entity56			0
docked on a bend of the @entity59 , the gargantuan ship towered over river traffic and even managed to make the huge @entity61 look comparatively small			0
looking around : the queen is shown around the flight deck by @entity8 's captain , @entity64 all smiles : @entity2 , who had lunch onboard the ship , appeared to enjoy her day rising up : the @entity2 has a go on the elevator used to lift aircraft to @entity8 's deck impressive : the gargantuan @entity8 is shortly to become the @entity53 's flagship taking an interest : the @entity2 has now visited @entity8 on four separate occasions involved : her majesty is kept updated about the progress of the ship and its activities royal visit : the @entity2 inspects her honour guard during a re-dedication ceremony for @entity8 @entity2 , who was making her fourth visit to the ship , was welcomed to @entity31 , the @entity53 's @entity3 base , where she was welcomed by vice admiral @entity83 to the sound of a 21 - gun royal salute			1
joined by @entity31 's commanding officer , captain @entity86 and captain @entity64 of @entity8 , she then heard the @entity87 ahead of a re-dedication ceremony for the ship			1
her majesty , who was wearing the same cheerful ensemble worn for last year 's @entity91 service at @entity92 , then inspected a guard of honour drawn from the men and women serving on @entity8			1
she also was also shown around the helicopter carrier before being treated to lunch in @entity8 's @entity99			1
a @entity101 spokesman said : ' every @entity53 warship has a @entity25 and @entity2 holds this title with @entity8			2
' the relationship continues throughout the life of the ship , each successive captain keeping @entity2 informed of the ship 's activities and hosting visits			0

big arrival : the @entity4 pulls into @entity120 after a three - hour journey from @entity32 on duty : @entity2 , who was wearing a cheerful purple ensemble , steps off the train at @entity3 warm welcome : the queen was met by sir @entity39 ( centre ) and the lord mayor of @entity3 , @entity129 cheers : the queen was met at the station by a flag - waving crowd and was presented with several posies @entity135 : the @entity2 makes her way out of the station clutching a pretty posy of spring flowers on her way : the @entity2 's official state @entity42 had been driven down to meet her at the station ' it provides an appropriate occasion for @entity2 to reaffirm publicly her link to @entity8 and meet the new crew			1
' @entity8 is one of the most important ships in the @entity53 and is used to deploy @entity148 directly into war zones via helicopter or landing craft			2
as a result , the 380 - strong ship 's company includes the 9 @entity155 who operate the ship 's four @entity158 landing craft			0
the ship , which saw service during the @entity162 and was also deployed to @entity163 , has also seen service closer to home , most notably when it was used to ferry aircraft passengers stranded in @entity167 by the 2010 @entity169 eruption back across the @entity170			0
although every @entity53 warship has a @entity25 , @entity8 is the only one sponsored by the @entity2 , whose role includes being kept informed of its progress and making regular visits			2
