car rental companies in @entity1 are adding ' winterisation charges ' on their vehicles that will see standard rates soar for tourists			2
winter tyres and snow chains on hire cars are compulsory in some areas and can be up to £ 114			1
@entity10 researched the costs of five rental companies in seven @entity1 ski gateways ( @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 ) for a week 's hire from december 27 to january 3 , 2015			1
winter tyres are just one thing that will add cost to hiring a car in @entity1 this winter it found the average ' winterisation ' cost across the seven destinations was over £ 40 , but could be up to £ 114 in @entity14 with @entity28 , significantly increasing a customer 's overall rental cost			1
paying the winterisation charge of almost £ 60 in @entity17 with @entity33 , for instance , represents an additional 30 per cent on the original hire cost			1
in @entity36 and @entity37 winter tyres are mandatory , yet despite this @entity28 levy a ' winterisation ' charge of £ 25 in @entity16			2
the added charges for ' winterisation ' have been blasted by the founder of @entity10 snow chains must also be used , where instructed in mountainous areas , in @entity45 , @entity37 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity36 and @entity48			0
( average costs to hire a medium compact car for a week ) @entity14 - £ 409.43			1
the ' winterisation ' cost is included in the rental price in some instances but this varies greatl			0
for example @entity33 did not charge extra in @entity14 or @entity16 but charged £ 57 in @entity17 , £ 40 in @entity18 and £ 24 in @entity15			1
in @entity17 all five rental companies charged a ' winterisation ' fee averaging £ 53			2
' car hire companies are well known for surprise snowballing costs at the rental desk , ' said @entity63 , ceo and founder of @entity10			0
' why each individual customer should be held to account for winter tyres that have been changed once for the winter season is ludicrous and is another example of hidden costs that can make the original rental price not such a good deal			0
' ' it 's frustrating that that the rental companies use ' winter ' as yet another opportunity to make money from their car hire customer but unfortunately it 's your responsibility and not the rental company 's to make sure that you 're driving with the correct equipment for wintery conditions			0
' we advise that you shop around and make sure that you factor in the ' winterisation ' cost			0

research for seven destination show extra charges are over £ 40
but in @entity14 with @entity28 it could be as much as £ 114
in @entity17 *travellers* will pay an additional 30 *%* of original hire cost
