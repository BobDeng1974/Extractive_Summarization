@entity0 are ready to exploit a little - known @entity2 rule to sign @entity3 despite failing with a bid for @entity6 ’s striker in the transfer window			1
the @entity9 club were prepared to pay £ 4million for @entity3 and loan him back to @entity6 for the rest of the season , but were told that such a deal is against the regulations			1
however , it has emerged that , under @entity15 , @entity0 can sign a pre- contract with @entity3 and his club — subject to the approval of the @entity19 — which guarantees the player a transfer to @entity22 in the summer while allowing him to stay at @entity6 for the rest of this season			1
@entity0 want to sign @entity6 striker @entity3 , who is out of contract in the summer the @entity9 club are ready to exploit a @entity2 loophole to sign the player on a pre-contract the rule is designed to ensure transparency			1
while such an agreement is unusual , a similar deal was struck between @entity32 and @entity33 for @entity34 in january 2010 which set out the defender ’s £ 10m move to @entity38 six months later			2
@entity34 never played against @entity32 in that time , however , while @entity3 is set to face @entity0 when @entity6 visit @entity22 in a month			1
one of the criteria the board will examine is that there is no conflict of interest , such as undue pressure being put on @entity3 or @entity6 for him to miss that game			1
@entity6 were determined not to let @entity3 leave in the january window as they fight to stay in the @entity2 , but have accepted he will not sign a new contract when his four - year deal runs out at the end of the season			1
they stand to receive about £ 3m in compensation if he joins another @entity55 club in the summer but only £ 200,000 if he moves abroad			0
there was speculation on deadline day that the @entity60 under 21 striker was close to agreeing a pre- contract with @entity62			0
manager @entity63 admitted after saturday ’s defeat at @entity65 that the speculation had affected @entity3 ’s performance			2
@entity3 has impressed during his debut season in the @entity2 with @entity6 the striker , who was also linked heavily with @entity69 , has netted seven times in the @entity2 the 22 - year - old is known to favour a move to @entity0 and the feeling at @entity74 is that he will perform better for the remainder of the season if his future is resolved			1
@entity0 are prepared to pay up to £ 5m to keep @entity3 out of the clutches of their rivals			2
first on the agenda for @entity0 tonight is the @entity83 fourth - round replay against @entity84			2
they may start with @entity86 — once a popular loan player at @entity84 — as they look to advance in a competition manager @entity89 desperately wants to win after last week ’s narrow @entity91 semi-final defeat at @entity92			0
‘ if anything , that defeat has only promoted the development and momentum that we have , ’ said the @entity0 manager			2
‘ of course we wanted to get to the final but the performance level from the two games has given us great encouragement			0
‘ our best football is yet to come			0
we have got our identity back			0
we want to take that into the games and get to cup finals			0
‘ it will be a tough game for us			0
we have a big month coming up and we want to continue in the cup competitions as well as keeping the momentum going in the league			0
