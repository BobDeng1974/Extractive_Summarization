@entity1 's plans to field an unchanged team against @entity3 on saturday were shattered by another injury setback on tuesday night — leaving @entity5 poised to replace fellow @entity8 wing @entity6			1
having revealed at lunchtime that @entity6 trained fully in the morning , hours later the national coaches were forced to rule him out of the @entity11 at @entity12			1
the @entity14 - born soldier suffered a thigh injury in the 24 - 21 defeat against @entity17 last weekend			1
in response to the unwelcome development , @entity1 retained @entity20 in their squad to play the world ’s no 2 - ranked side			2
however , @entity5 — who made his test debut off the bench against @entity17 — is set to start on the right flank ; having long been identified by @entity27 as a player of star potential			1
@entity5 ( above ) is poised to replace @entity6 , who has been ruled out of @entity30 @entity6 suffered a thigh injury during @entity1 's 24 - 21 defeat to @entity17 last weekend head coach @entity27 said : ‘ @entity33 did some limited training but is unlikely to fully recover from his thigh injury in time for the game so @entity20 is in the group			1
’ there are also concerns about @entity41 flanker @entity40 , which has led to @entity43 captain @entity42 being kept on standby			1
@entity27 added : ‘ @entity40 is still sore from the weekend and sat out training so we are including five back rows to give us options			1
’ @entity40 will be given every chance to prove he is fit to face the @entity3 , as part of the same pack which started the match against the world champions four days ago			1
@entity40 ( above ) is also an injury concern as head coach @entity27 said he sat out training @entity5 ( above ) made his test debut when he came off the bench during the @entity17 defeat 15 @entity57 ( @entity58 ) 14 @entity5 ( @entity8 ) 13 @entity59 ( @entity60 ) 12 @entity61 ( @entity8 ) 11 @entity62 ( @entity63 ) 10 @entity64 ( @entity60 ) 9 @entity65 ( @entity58 ) 1 @entity66 ( @entity58 ) 2 @entity67 ( @entity41 ) 3 @entity68 ( @entity8 ) 4 @entity69 ( @entity8 ) 5 @entity70 ( @entity41 ) 6 @entity40 ( @entity41 ) 7 @entity71 ( @entity58 , capt ) 8 @entity73 ( @entity60 ) @entity74 understands @entity75 and his coaches had resolved to field an unchanged team , having decided that a fifth successive loss against the peerless @entity79 is no cause for panic			1
having identified the need to generate attacking fluency and cohesion , @entity75 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 wanted to give the same line - up another chance			2
that ambition was dashed by @entity6 ’s thigh problem , but earlier there had been better news			1
@entity8 centre @entity61 returned to training after illness , thus delaying the prospect of @entity98 and @entity64 being reunited as a 10 - 12 axis which proved mighty effective at age - group level			1
@entity41 forwards @entity67 and @entity70 are expected to be passed fit , despite both suffering concussion last weekend			2
as ever , midfield remains a focus for debate			2
the possibility of a @entity108 - @entity64 alliance came to the fore due to @entity1 ’s kicking deficiencies against the @entity17			1
however , the latest centre partnership — the 10th employed under @entity27 ; @entity61 and @entity59 — acquitted themselves well with a limited supply of prime possession			1
@entity74 understands @entity27 had wanted to name an unchanged side against @entity3 but the injury to @entity6 means changes will be made for the game against the number two ranked side @entity87 is well versed in the perennial @entity122 search for the most effective double - act in the 12 and 13 shirts , having been involved in it as a player and now as a coach			1
on tuesday , he said : ‘ i think it worked very well at the weekend			0
from a defensive point of view we were very solid and from an attacking one , we were very limited by what we got			0
‘ but we saw what @entity61 could do in the first test in @entity17 when we got front - foot ball — the right type of ball			1
@entity61 and @entity59 are on top of their game			0
you have got two guys that are massively confident at the moment			0
@entity27 was full of praise for @entity61 ( above ) for his performance against @entity17 @entity27 added that @entity61 's partner in the centre @entity59 ( centre ) is on top of his game ‘ @entity61 is doing all right with @entity64 and we expect a big performance this weekend , too			1
’ @entity87 also acknowledged the need for midfield continuity , which has often been an elusive target due to disruptive injuries			0
at present , @entity155 and @entity156 are out of the selection equation but @entity87 knows @entity1 need to stick , rather than keep twisting			0
‘ there is good competition in those areas but it is about consistency , ’ said the @entity160 - winner			0
‘ at the end of the day you want a good established 12 and 13 who can do a job for you			0
you want to get the combinations right			0
@entity59 runs with the ball during the @entity1 media session held at @entity174 on november 11 @entity3 hope to make up for defeat in @entity176 by making @entity1 suffer at @entity12 on saturday			2
@entity177 , @entity3 ’s assistant coach , says the @entity3 believe holding @entity1 to 15 points or less will provide a platform for victory			0
he said : ‘ if you concede less than 15 , you have a good chance of winning test matches , but we know we ’ve got big improvements to make			0
’ ‘ @entity156 and @entity185 did exceptionally well in the @entity186			0
@entity156 is injured now and @entity61 has had a fantastic start to the season , so he deserves his shot			0
@entity59 has been exceptional for @entity60 yet again and he deserves a shot			0
’ @entity59 has often been classified as a wonderfully effective defensive centre without any positive credentials as an attacking force			0
but it was his fine pass which teed up @entity62 ’s early try against @entity17 and @entity87 added : ‘ @entity59 does the simple things very well			1
@entity185 passes the ball during the @entity1 training session at @entity174 on tuesday the @entity1 team lined up to observe a two minutes silence on @entity202 at 11 o'clock ‘ he carries the ball well and what he brings to the team is what you do n’t see			2
it is how he makes the team feel			2
‘ he is one of the leaders			0
he is composed , he gives the guys solutions on the pitch and everybody feels very comfortable with him around			0
’ @entity1 are on high alert about the prospect of facing a @entity3 side who are reeling from their emphatic defeat against the @entity221 in @entity176 last saturday			2
@entity87 spoke about the need to ‘ stop the big green machine rolling ’ and added : ‘ we know what is coming			0

@entity27 wanted to field unchanged team from @entity17 defeat
but @entity6 's thigh injury put paid to those plans
fellow @entity8 wing @entity5 is poised to fill the void
@entity40 is also an injury doubt for the @entity30
