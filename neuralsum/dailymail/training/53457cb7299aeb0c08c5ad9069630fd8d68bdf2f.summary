by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 05:16 est , 27 august 2013 a @entity2 advert has gone viral after the actors it features were deemed ' the world 's worst ' by online critics			1
the video , which was leaked on to @entity8 , has faced criticism with thousands of people claiming the the men and woman featured desperately fail to convince the viewer of their excitement about the promoted piece of computer hardware			2
the three - minute long film which praises the technology company 's @entity19 drive has been taken down from various user accounts			2
' after complaining that her computer takes too long to reboot she is given the new hardware to test			0
stick to the day job : this actor failed to deliver a convincing performance looking distinctly less than enthusiastic the whole way through the three minute long video the actor feigned surprise when the product appeared on screen ' aw , i did it , did you see that ? ' she says after successfully attaching the equipment to her laptop			1
two male actors are also featured but deliver equally unconvincing performances			0
one half - heartedly asks : ' wow , this is the @entity68 right ? ' while the other proclaims : ' it 's so thin and light ! '			0
a thread on social news and entertainment website , @entity74 , has offered unimpressed viewers a platform to discuss their thoughts on the video , under the title : ' @entity81 ad featuring possibly the world 's worst actors			1
' really ? : this actor perhaps went over the top in his portrayal of a businessman who 's fed up of his computer slowing down this actor 's flailing attempt to promote the piece of hardware does little to entice viewers comments include one from a person who claims to have taken part in the video , acting out the role of one of the businessmen			1
under his username , @entity102 , he said the advert was never intended to be released in @entity105 , and only be viewed in @entity29			1
written by non-native @entity107 speakers , he said the technology giant instructed him and the other two actors to speak deliberately slowly so their words could be ' dubbed over in @entity111 ' insisting he could ' do a better job ' , the commenter said he was merely following the director 's instructions			1
@entity81 has not responded since video emerged			0
other critics claim however the video 's flaws stem further than poor acting , and that the script used is out - dated and sexist			2
' why did they make the woman so much dumber than the men ? ' one user commented			0
' when i 'm not helping my children with homework or looking at pictures of them , i leave the computer on while doing housework ! i did n't realize they had computers in 1950 , ' said another .			0
