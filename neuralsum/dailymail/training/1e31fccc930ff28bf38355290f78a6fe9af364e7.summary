by @entity0 this contraption looks like something the @entity3 would use during a painful assimilation operation			0
but despite its terrifying appearance , these strange goggles have been designed to help astronauts see better in space			1
and it does n’t need complicated cyborg technology to work – all that ’s required is eyewash solution , a pump and a willing test subject			1
@entity18 astronaut @entity17 tests the space eyewash goggles at @entity21 s @entity20 in @entity22 the goggles have been designed to clear flecks of dust and other particles from an astronaut ’s vision while on board the @entity29			1
in zero gravity , all manner of substances could be found floating around in the air , from dust to chilli flakes and even sweat			2
if something gets into an astronaut ’s eye , it ’s difficult to get it out because rinsing it under running water is impossible			2
we are the @entity3 : the contraption has been likened to something @entity47 's the @entity3 ( pictured ) would use during a painful assimilation operation when firefighters want to extinguish a blaze , they often douse it with water			0
astronauts on board the @entity29 , however , are experimenting with a form of water that does the opposite			1
instead of stopping fire , this water helps start it			0
' we call it ‘ " supercritical water , " ' said @entity64 of the @entity65 in @entity66			0
' and it has some interesting properties			0
' water becomes supercritical when it compressed to a pressure of 217 atmospheres and heated above 373 ° @entity73 above that so - called critical point , ordinary @entity74 transforms into something that is neither solid , liquid , nor gas			0
it 's more of a ' liquid - like gas			0
' ' when supercritical water is mixed with organic material , a chemical reaction takes place — oxidation , ' said @entity64			0
' it 's a form of burning without flames			0
' the @entity29 does n’t have running tap water , and if it did , the stream would float away in expanding bubbles of silvery liquid			2
to combat the problem , engineers have come up with the space eye - wash googles , seen here on @entity18 astronaut @entity17 at @entity20 in @entity22			1
the goggles are connected to a specially - formulated solution that is pumped around the eyes			1
although the contraption might look painful , @entity17 said : ‘ it does not feel weird , but on the contrary it is good to know that we have these items onboard			1
this medical refresher course is getting @entity17 ready for his @entity108 mission that begins 28 may			2
@entity17 will be leaving for space with cosmonaut @entity110 and @entity21 astronaut @entity111 for a six - month expedition on the @entity29			1
the geophysicist and volcanologist will become the third @entity115 to visit the @entity29			2

goggles are connected to eyewash solution which is pumped around eyes
engineers designed the *device* to help astronaut 's wash irritating dust and particles from their eyes while onboard the @entity29
the *system* is shown here being tested by @entity18 astronaut @entity17
