by @entity0 published : 16:25 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 13 december 2012 lying deep beneath the streets of @entity2 , hidden in the secret vaults of the @entity4 , is 4,600 tonnes of ' forgotten gold '			1
worth £ 197billion pounds , the rows of gold bullions - which are kept in a closely guarded location - are rarely seen by outsiders			1
but the @entity4 's precious metal reserves - each shelf worth £ 35million each - have been filmed by the @entity12 for a new series about elements called @entity15			1
given coveted access he reveals the incredible sight of row upon row of the gold bars displayed like ' chocolates in the duty free at the airport ' he says : ' i 've never seen so much gold			1
in fact , i 've never seen so much of any element			0
' the prof sad he and his film team had to go through a host of security checks to access the vault			2
all cash must be left as the door , because no one is allowed to bring money into the vault			0
he said : ' @entity59 's first reaction is that it ca n't be real because normally you do n't see such things			2
it looks like chocolates in the duty free at the airport			1
' but these really are solid gold bars and it is extraordinary			1
there is n't any smell because metals do n't smell and it 's very quiet because of the thick walls to keep it secure			2
' it 's been very cold recently and i was ready to be shivering but it 's nice and warm but i suppose gold colour gives you a feeling of warmth so it maybe partly psychological			1
' although @entity81 owns around 310 tones of gold ' other organisations ' use the secure vault to store their bullion			0
prof @entity18 was allowed to film the vault for the university as part of a series about elements called @entity15 if all the gold in the world was gathered in one space it would fill the size of just one large house even when bars are sold , they are not removed from the cavernous space			1
instead , each bar has its own number and that is simply transferred to the ownership of the buyer			0
the oldest bar in the vault has been there since 1916			0
he added : ' the beauty of gold is that it is very inactive			0
it looks just the same now as it did in 1916			0
it has n't tarnished , it has n't got oxide layers on the surface			0
' the bank allowed him to show off two individual bars , one originally from @entity121 and one from @entity122 each weighing round 28 lbs and worth about £ 435,000 each			1
the academic has estimated if all the gold ever mined was made into bricks it would end up in a block 20 metres cubed or around 60ft wide , high and deep			1
this means if all the gold in the world was gathered in one space it would fill the size of just one large house			0
but as he stands between the piles of 28lb 24 - carat gold bullion , prof @entity18 confesses he is slightly disappointed by the scene			2
' @entity139 is an exciting element , it has interesting chemistry and it 's just sitting here doing nothing ' ' it 's enormously impressive but it 's a bit sad , rather like a mausoleum where the dead gold is sitting waiting for people to remember it			2
' ' it should be doing exciting reactions , ' he adds .			0
