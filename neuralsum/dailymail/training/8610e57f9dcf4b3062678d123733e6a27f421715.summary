by @entity0 the parents of a murder victim were devastated when they overheard a judge say victim impact statements ‘ make no difference ’ at a parole hearing for one of their son ’s killers			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , who had made their statement on a video link , heard judge @entity15 ’s comments when the link was accidentally left open			1
their son @entity17 , 21 , was stabbed to death in 2001 by a gang of four men , in what police suspect was a case of mistaken identity			1
pain : @entity10 and @entity11 had just finished giving a statement when they heard the judges comments two of the killers , doormen @entity29 , 26 , and @entity32 , 24 , were caught and were sentenced to life imprisonment , but recently applied to the @entity34 to be moved to an open prison			1
mr @entity11 ’s parents , who opposed the move , were invited to read a victim statement to the judge before he came to a decision			1
in their statement at @entity32 ’s hearing , they said they were ‘ serving a life sentence of heartache and grief and pain ’			0
mrs @entity47 , 58 , told the @entity48 : ‘ the judge was sympathetic and thanked us for reading the statement and said he was closing the link			1
‘ they could n’t hear us or see us any longer but we still had the link open and could see and hear them			2
‘ the judge turned round and said to someone else in the room , “ i feel so very sorry for these families			0
they make these statements thinking they are going to make a difference , but they make no difference at all			2
someone should tell them ”			0
’ tragic : their son @entity17 , 21 , was stabbed to death in 2001 but his killers are applying for an open prison mother - of - five @entity47 , who described @entity17 as a ‘ fabulous son ’ , added : ‘ it was as though time stopped			1
@entity11 and i looked at each in disbelief , we were dumbfounded			2
‘ the heartache that we go through to do these statements , to be told they do n’t make any difference			2
’ judge @entity15 apologised for his remark , which he said was made in a ‘ private conversation ’			1
he said : ‘ i am sorry if what they overheard upset them and if it made them feel that what they had said had no impact because it certainly did , but what it ca n’t do is affect our judgment of his [ @entity32 ’s ] risk			0
‘ we do n’t think that victims necessarily have explained to them what the role of the board is and what we have to take into account			0
’ @entity34 chairman sir @entity102 said there would be an investigation into what was said			0
he added that victims should be told what their statements may or may not achieve			0
in a hearing , the @entity34 assesses the risk a prisoner poses , taking into account their offending history , their progress and reports from psychologists and prison officers			0
the board says victims can ‘ play an important part ’ in helping them reach a decision and can affect the conditions of release , such as an order not to contact victims			0
but @entity11 and mrs @entity47 , from @entity123 , @entity124 , said the @entity34 has been misleading about the role of victim statements			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ what is the point ? why are we being put through pain and heartbreak for no apparent reason ? i feel the judge was an honourable man and he was very , very honest			1
we were privy to a conversation that we would not normally be			0
so i just feel he ’s very honest			0
’ mrs @entity47 added : ‘ i ’m pleased we heard that statement because it ’s not just for us , it ’s for other victims ’ families			1
we go through so much anyway , but then to realise the pain that you ’ve gone through trying to make a difference for your loved - one is n’t making any difference at all ... they ’re not being truthful to victims ’ families			2
’ ' sorry ' : judge @entity15 apologised to the family after remarking that their words will ' make no difference ' in their statement , @entity11 and mrs @entity47 described how they rushed to hospital after @entity17 was stabbed 15 times on a night out			1

that sight of @entity17 will haunt us forever			0
’ his last words to his father were : ‘ i ca n’t breathe			0
