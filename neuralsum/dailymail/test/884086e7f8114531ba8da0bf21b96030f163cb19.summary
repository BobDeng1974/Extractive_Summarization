a mother - of - two lost more than ten stone after she became concerned that her size was causing her to look like a man			1
@entity4 , 39 , piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children , reaching a worrying 20st 3lb			1
however , the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions			2
@entity4 became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight @entity4 's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight			1
before she slimmed down @entity4 's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure - hiding garments , and she was afraid she was losing her femininity			1
@entity4 who lives in @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape			1
' i only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when i was fat - i was trying to cover up my body because i was embarrassed			2
i stopped looking like a woman			2
' now i 've slimmed down and i feel confident enough to wear dresses again			2
i feel healthy and very feminine			2
' @entity4 married her husband @entity36 , 41 , in 1999			1
after the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep - fat fryer			2
@entity4 piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children , as she became heavier she worried that her husband @entity42 would not see her as the ' sexy ' woman he married before her weight loss @entity4 was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 the housewife 's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev , deep - fried chicken , potato croquettes and burgers			1
she said : ' we loved pizza , chips and chicken kievs			2
the deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house			0
' soon after @entity4 gave birth to her children @entity66 , now 14 , and @entity67 , 13 , and her weight gain accelerated			1
eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her			0
the turning point came for @entity4 when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area @entity4 joined @entity77 in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks ' i tried to take pride in my appearance , but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering , i ordered all my clothes from catalogues			1
' before long i had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man			1
i had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman			0
i was worried that the the sexy , curvy bride which @entity42 had married had disappeared forever			1
' the turning point came for @entity4 when she was out with her children on @entity98 in 2011			1
she had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up			0
she said : ' i was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home			0
i was hot and sweaty and i had to stop to catch my breath			0
' my weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - i knew it was time to change			0
' when i got home that night i found a @entity77 leaflet had been posted through my door			1
i thought it was a sign			0
' @entity4 started attending her local @entity77 classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight			1
she said : ' it took all my courage to go to the meetings - i was convinced everyone would judge me			0
@entity4 feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing ' three weeks later i 'd shed a stone and i celebrated by telling my husband and the kids			1
they were all very supportive and amazed at what i had done			0
' in a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch			0
@entity4 even threw out her double deep - fat - fryer			1
the devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off			2
soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good			0
she said : ' i love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me			0
i do n't need to order from catalogues any more			0
' i feel fantastic and i look great			0
i have a new life now			0
' breakfast : nothing lunch : fry - up with four slices of buttered bread dinner : chicken @entity148 with potato croquettes and chips snacks : crisps breakfast : porridge with berries lunch : scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms dinner : chicken stir - fry snacks : throughout the day she snacks on yoghurt and fresh fruit			0
