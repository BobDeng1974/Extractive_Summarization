while having a baby is a joyous time for families , nine months of pregnancy followed by the sleepless nights , the challenges of breast feeding and hormonal changes have their own effect on new mums			1
as the @entity11 prepares to have her second child next month , she ’ll no doubt be prepared for any post-birth eventuality			1
but just in case , we ’ve helped prepare a shopping list of must - have products that have been tried and tested by from other @entity19 mothers including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity21 has long been a fan of @entity37 , £ 8.95 , a mixture of calendula , lavender , rosemary oils and vitamins a and @entity43 , that claims to soften skin to prevent the marks and also reduce the appearance of stretch marks after pregnancy			1
she said : ' it [ @entity37 ] prevents wrinkles around my eyes and stretch marks over my body			1
' for best results the makers of @entity37 , recommend that it 's applied twice daily for at least three months reality tv star @entity57 apparently loves @entity37 , £ 8.95 , for preventing stretch marks on her body for best results @entity37 , which includes vitamin a and e , should be applied twice daily for at least three months @entity22 's hair supplement post-natal hair loss is an issue for many new mothers			1
this is because pregnancy hormones stop womens ’ usual daily hair - shedding , giving the appearance of extra-thick hair			1
but once the hormones return to normal about three to six months after birth , the extra hair finally falls out			2
although many mums fear they 're going bald , in fact their hair is returning to normal in a process that can take up to a year			2
@entity22 noticed her hair was thinning after having both her children @entity82 , aged 11 , and @entity81 , now three			1
she told @entity92 in 2012 : ‘ when i had [ first son ] @entity82 , i was 24 and did n’t really experience any changes to my hair or skin			2
but with my second child , i got acne , all my hair fell out after he was born , and i definitely had to work out to drop the weight			2
no pregnancy is easy to bounce back from			2
’ but her stylist @entity94 credits the supplement @entity96 for restoring her tousled locks to their full thickness			2
@entity96 , £ 49.95 one month supply , contains an amino acid called @entity101 , discovered by a @entity103 dermatologist who was studying the @entity105 population of @entity106 and noticed their thick , healthy hair , which he linked to the protein now used in the capsules to boost hair growth			1
like many new mothers , actress @entity22 experienced post-partum hair loss and thinning after having both of her children , @entity82 , aged 11 , and son of @entity117 frontman @entity116 , @entity81 , now aged 3 @entity118 while ' waist training ' by wearing a structured corset for several hours a day to cinch in your waist has recently become a celebrity craze , @entity20 swore by a similar practice after giving birth to her two daughters @entity127 , seven , and @entity128 , four			1
it 's thought that compression from the girdle helps the uterus to return to normal size			2
also , during pregnancy the muscle that runs down the centre of the stomach separates and it 's thought that the corsets can help push them back together again more quickly			1
the @entity141 star said : ' i wore a double corset day and night for three months			0
it was brutal ; it ’s not for everyone			0
it was sweaty , but worth it			0
' @entity20 has said that after having both of her children , she started wearing her corset immediately , until the ' loosely - goosey ' feeling had disappeared			0
@entity20 revealed that she wore a post-partum girdle for two to three months to get rid of her ' mum - tum ' post-natal corsets promise to hold stomachs in place and support backs after birth @entity23 's natural body oil @entity23 might have landed herself in hot water for many of the extreme health recommendations featured on her website @entity164 , but her top pregnancy tip appears to be less controversial			1
talking about how she fended off stretch marks while pregnant with her two children , @entity168 , eight , and @entity169 , 14 , the actress says she slathered herself with sweet almond oil			1
she wrote on @entity164 : ' use copious amounts of sweet almond oil on your belly , thighs , and breasts			2
' apply the oil in an infinity symbol or figure eight pattern around your breasts to help stimulate lymphatic drainage and relieve any chest ache or discomfort			0
' @entity23 suggests applying @entity184 to your belly , thighs and breasts to help stretching skin @entity190 ' @entity189 the @entity192 model has recently given birth to her first child @entity194 and has n't wasted any time in dishing out tips for other mothers			0
writing on her website mollysims.com , the model consulted a lactation consultant to advise on the problem of low milk supply			0
she wrote : ' most treatment plans for low milk supply call for increased caloric intake , plenty of fluids , and herbal supplements such as fenugreek or goat ’s rue			0
' available at most health food shops , the herbal supplements are both widely recognised as ancient remedies used by women to increase breast milk supply			0
@entity192 actress and model @entity190 recommends herbal supplements to help with low breast milk supply herbal remedy @entity218 has been been used for centuries by women to boost breast milk supply naturally ( left ) ; @entity23 recommends rubbing sweet almond oil into breasts @entity224 's @entity223 sore nipples are a common complaint of many women who choose to breastfeed			1
@entity228 , professional dancer and wife of former @entity231 bandmember @entity230 , has revealed that while breastfeeding her baby @entity232 , who arrived in september last year , she has relied on @entity234 nipple cream , £ 10.99			0
' that has been my saviour for breastfeeding			0
i would have started putting it on before he arrived if i had known ! it ’s like magic cream , ' she told @entity244			0
specially developed to help soothe and protect sore , cracked nipples , the cream is natural with no preservatives or additives			0
it also has no taste , colour or perfume , and is hypoallergenic , so there 's no need to remove before breastfeeding			0
