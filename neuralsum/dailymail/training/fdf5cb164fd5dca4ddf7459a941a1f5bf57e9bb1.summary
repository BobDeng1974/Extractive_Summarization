it comes after the @entity14 president stopped off at @entity4 on his return home from the @entity18 summit in @entity19 in september			2
@entity0 visited @entity4 today to highlight a tunnel passing @entity4 , which is among dozens of new road schemes announced by the government mr @entity0 arrived at the @entity24 site to welcome the £ 15bm investment into @entity27 's roads mr @entity0 's visit came after @entity1 visited the @entity29 earlier this morning mr @entity1 was first to arrive at @entity4 – trumpeting the government 's announcement that the @entity33 close to the famous stones will be put into a tunnel , thus easing conditions at a notorious bottleneck			1
the prime minister then arrived at the @entity24 landmark claiming there was now an ' unstoppable momentum ' behind the scheme			1
he said : ' i think we are both delighted that it is going ahead because it 's been the work of our government to get the government 's finances under control			0
' but frankly the more politicians that come here and say it 's good that we are building the roads the country needs , frankly the happier i will be			0
' asked whether the project would go ahead even if there was a change of government in may , mr @entity0 said : ' it has unstoppable momentum now , because the plan for the tunnel is robust , the money in the national budget is there , the vital importance of infrastructure is now accepted by everybody			2
i think this is now unstoppable			0
' the tunnel is part of a £ 2 billion scheme to dual the entire @entity33 and @entity74 to the @entity75			2
