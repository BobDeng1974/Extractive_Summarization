he was pasty - faced and overweight , with a hacking cough and shabby clothes that smelled of booze , tobacco and worse			1
yet @entity5 could get the ladies into bed , all right — even though he was n’t much good under the covers			1
@entity5 was as faithful as a randy rabbit , but he wooed women with a shower of sensual , shimmering words that fell on the parched earth of their souls			1
the love of his life was as destructive and damaged as he was , and though others tried to save him from himself , the writer was doomed to die at 39 , after a ( disputed ) mammoth drinking session in @entity21			0
@entity23 rabbit : @entity5 was constantly unfaithful , but wooed women with a shower of sensual , shimmering words six decades after his death , @entity5 is creeping back into fashion			1
but the superb rolling music of his lines is n’t to everybody ’s taste ; some prefer their poetry crisper , sharper , cooler			0
the trouble is that there have been many , many accounts of his shambolic , sponging , drunken life — and the more you read , the harder it is to separate the petulant , self - indulgent , overgrown child from the glorious bard , who is surely one of the most interesting voices of the last century			0
@entity45 paints a largely sympathetic portrait of the poet , which is fitting , since her unique ‘ way in ’ is through the eyes of her own father , the distinguished painter @entity51			0
he completed three portraits of his lifelong friend — and these ( pictured on the book jacket ) give @entity45 her loose structure : the ‘ three lives ’			0
what makes this book so readable is the fact that it offers rather more than @entity5 and his insalubrious escapades			1
portrait of a poet : @entity5 by his friend , painter @entity51 @entity51 creates an affectionate group - memoir of a creative set of young @entity67 — @entity5 , @entity51 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 — who left the land of their fathers to make their way in the world , painting , writing and making music			1
there are some lovely stories			0
when the painter and the poet were sharing a chaotic flat in @entity84 , @entity51 was in charge of the rent , ‘ and while @entity5 only had a mattress to sleep on , if he did n’t pay his share , @entity51 , who was much taller and stronger , would pick him up , turn him upside down and shake him till any loose change fell out of his trouser pockets ’			2
@entity5 ’s nastier side displayed itself very early			1
he was used to being molly - coddled by his too - devoted mother @entity94 and hated having to fend for himself			0
so he wrote to a @entity96 friend ‘ complaining about the “ little maggots ” he was living with and how boring and provincial he found them ’			0
nowhere in her book does @entity45 indicate that her father was anything other than a good friend to the often - disgusting @entity5 — and , indeed , after the poet ’s premature death , @entity51 was very caring and attentive to @entity94			1
in 1936 , @entity5 met @entity105 , who had been neglected by appalling parents and raped by the artist @entity107			2
she was to match @entity5 in alcoholism and promiscuity , and expressed her rage and frustration at his dissolute , irresponsible life by physically attacking him			2
she was a pretty dreadful mother , by all accounts , and her own children knew the feel of her fists			0
on the other hand , @entity45 comments that it ’s hard not to empathise with the hard - pressed woman who said : ‘ had i not gone to the pub with @entity5 i would have been left there , sitting like a fool			2
’ unlikely lothario : despite being pasty - faced , overweight and constantly smelling of booze , @entity5 ( played by @entity124 ) could get ladies into bed the author is at pains to remind us of @entity5 ’s quieter , gentler side , too , and brings us up to date with what happened after his death : the long struggles over his inheritance and what became of children and grandchildren			1
her analysis of his literary legacy is deft , but almost the most delightful thing about this book is its tribute to her talented father , who died in 1999 and was clearly a man of integrity			0
which , i ’m afraid , nobody could say of @entity5 .			2

despite being pasty and overweight , the writer was a hit with the ladies
unfortunately he was *n't* much good under the covers
new biography offers a different , gentler aspect to @entity5 , but also shows his nastier side
