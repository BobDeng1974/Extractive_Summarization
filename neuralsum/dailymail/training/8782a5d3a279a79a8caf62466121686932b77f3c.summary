by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 4 february 2013 the government 's ' fixation ' with wind turbines will ' steal @entity5 's soul ' if politicians continue to come up with ways of producing green energy			1
@entity10 's conservative leader @entity9 said that the beautiful @entity11 is at risk of being scarred by up to 400 new wind turbines which will be erected there			1
the leader complained that district councils in the area , which hosts the protected national park , waste thousands of pounds trying to appeal against planning decisions to install turbines , but commonly lose the fight			1
spoilt view : a wind farm at @entity25 , @entity11 , @entity26 , - one of many which will ' scar ' the landscape anti-wind farm campaigners claim @entity26 hosts as many turbines as all the other counties of @entity34 combined , according to the @entity35			1
speaking to the newspaper , mr @entity9 said there is a ' very , very strong feeling in @entity26 that we are taking more than our fair share ' of wind farms			1
he has written to @entity42 , a @entity44 energy minster , attacking the government 's policy on wind farms			2
he said that communities felt they could not stop the march of the wind farms across the country			2
mr @entity42 has previously pledged to stop the spread of wind farms but was ruled over by senior ministers			0
the row comes after a 115ft wind turbine crashed to the ground after being forced over in high winds			0
the @entity11 is one of the @entity59 's most stunning natural attractions , and attracts thousands of tourists every year the £ 250,000 tower was left a ' mangled , blackened wreck with melted blades ' , say witnesses , after apparently struggling to stand up to 50mph gusts last week			0
experts believe the winds were so strong the blades span out of control causing the massive structure to catch fire and collapse			0
it was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years – but has lasted just three			0
renewable energy company @entity73 installed the @entity74 e- 3120 @entity76 turbine at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , despite protests from villagers who said it would be noisy and spoil the view			0
in july a government agency admitted for the first time that wind farms can wipe tens of thousands of pounds off the value of homes			0
the @entity89 was forced to re-band homes into lower council tax categories , confirming what most residents who live near the giant turbines already know : they are detrimental to property prices			2
the move has made it harder for the wind farm industry to dismiss public concerns over the impact of their turbines .			1
