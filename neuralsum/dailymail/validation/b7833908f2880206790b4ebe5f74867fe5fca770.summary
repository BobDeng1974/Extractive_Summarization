it was a case of ‘ @entity1 ’ after a massive swordfish was caught by a 16 - year - old boy in @entity4 that weighed over three times his bodyweight and which took him six hours to get into the boat			1
the amazing feat was pulled off by teenage fisherman @entity10 - who weighs just 70kg - when he caught the record - breaking 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish about 35km off @entity4 ’s @entity12			1
what made the effort even more incredible was that the teenager caught the 263.5kg fish using just 24kg fishing line			1
it was for this reason it took him so long to reel the huge fish in as he was afraid the line would snap			2
i was pretty exhausted by then but once the fish was in the boat i just felt massive relief , ' @entity10 told @entity35 ' then there was a huge amount of excitement			1
lots of screaming and celebrating after that , and a team hug			0
it ’s something i ’m very proud of			2
' it 's believed to be the biggest swordfish ever hooked in @entity46 waters by amateurs			0
it beat the current @entity46 heaviest record catch for using only a 24kg line by 156 kilos , and beat the @entity46 all - tackle record by 88kg			2
it took @entity10 ( left ) six hours to get the giant 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish into the boat @entity10 kept the fish and divided it up amongst his mates who helped him to eat it			1
normally he uses the ' tag and release ' method when he catches fish , but made an exception this time as it was so big and he was going to eat it with his friends			0
apart from fishing @entity10 ’s in his first year doing a school - based apprenticeship as an automotive mechanic			1
' i ’ve been fishing all my life			0
it took a lot of concentration – a lot of mental and physical work			0
i just had to stay focused and not give up			0
after all that you have to hope you can land it , ' @entity10 says			2
‘ the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat			1
it ’s when things can go start to go wrong and people start to panic			0
there ’s always a lot more pressure as the fish gets closer to the boat			2
' @entity10 battled with the huge fish despite feeling mentally and physically exhausted @entity10 was onboard his friend @entity87 ’s 7m boat @entity87 while competing in the @entity90 fishing competition last saturday when he made his memorable catch			1
@entity87 explained that @entity10 had to stay patient and not rush into making any mistakes			1
' i mean the last three hours of the fight the fish was only 50 metres from the boat swimming around			0
@entity10 just had to be careful because the line was so much lighter than the weight of the fish , ' @entity87 told @entity35			1
the 16 - year - old was able to catch the massive swordfish using only 24kg fishing line ' it jumped about 23 times to try and get rid of the hook , but we still were n’t sure how big it was			1
it was only when we got it onto the boat that we realised the size of it			0
' @entity10 was really physically and mentally finished by the end			2
he really had to concentrate the whole time and not stop for a moment			0
' he did tremendously well for a boy of his age to land this kind of a fish			0
he ’s obviously a naturally talented fisherman			0
' the 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish jumps out of the sea to try and get rid of the hook			1

16 - year - old @entity10 from @entity4 *achieved* the amazing feat
the broad - bill swordfish weighed more than three times heavier than @entity10
he caught it using only 24kg fishing line off @entity4 ’s @entity12
@entity10 was onboard his friend @entity87 ’s 7m boat @entity134
' the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat , ' says @entity10
