@entity1 midfielder @entity0 says @entity2 have not been affected by uncertainty surrounding the venue for next week 's opening @entity6 qualifier against @entity7			1
the @entity8 said on wednesday that the game would take place as planned at @entity7 's new @entity11 , where a recently - laid @entity13 artificial surface attracted close scrutiny from @entity16 officials			1
' @entity16 has confirmed that the match will go ahead in @entity7 after the 3g pitch was given the green light , ' the @entity8 posted on its official website			1
no concern : @entity0 says @entity2 have not been affected over the uncertainty surrounding @entity7 's pitch plans were in place to switch the game to @entity27 had the surface failed final checks , but the go - ahead has now been given just six days before @entity2 ' @entity6 kick - off			1
' it does n't matter what pitch we play on , whatever surface , our focus on is how we play and perform , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have got to be confident whatever happens - we are there to get three points , and we have got to make sure that 's what we do			1
' we would prefer to play on grass , that 's what we do week in week out and it 's an obvious preference			1
' but we 've all played on artificial surfaces enough times to know what to expect from it , and it 's not a problem			2
' it 's not been an ideal situation not knowing where we were playing the game			2
it 's been more of an issue for fans with their travel arrangements , and you feel for them			2
star billing : @entity62 ( right ) and @entity63 train with @entity2 at the @entity64 ball inspection : @entity62 inspects a football during training ahead of the @entity6 qualifier at @entity7 happy times : @entity62 sees the funny side in the run up to the start of the @entity6 qualifiers ' but as a squad it 's not something we 've talked about too much			1
it 's not been affecting our preparations and we will get on with it			2
' @entity2 will not train on a 3g surface before tackling the @entity83 minnows next tuesday , but they should encounter few problems - either with the pitch or their opponents			1
and a strong start would set them up nicely for next month 's successive home games against @entity89 and @entity90			2
' it is a huge tournament , and we ca n't wait to get the campaign under way , ' @entity0 added			2
leading the way : @entity62 runs in front of the @entity2 squad during a jog around the stadium kicking practice : @entity62 was back in @entity64 for the first time since winning the @entity102 with @entity103 ' it sounds obvious to say it , but the start is vital			1
you want to get off the mark with a quick three points			0
' we 've got the belief and confidence we can make a good start and make big things happen in this group			0
it is a long road , but every minute we are together counts towards that end goal			0
' the change in the amount of teams that qualify has given us a boost			0
that , coupled with the players we 've got , we are really confident we can hit the ground running			0
' it is a group filled with tough teams , but we feel we can compete with them all			0
' @entity2 manager @entity128 will travel with a squad that contains star men @entity62 and @entity63 , and their combined impact is not lost on @entity0			1
under watch : @entity2 will hope to qualify for the @entity133 under @entity128 's management ' we 've got the likes of @entity62 and @entity63 , who have played consistently at the highest level for their clubs , and they are going to bring that to the table for us as well , which is fantastic , ' he said			1
' we expect to perform , and we have the quality to win the game			0
it 's as simple as that , really			0
' there is strong competition for places , and that always breeds success			0
' no - one can rest on their laurels			0
they know if they take their eye off the ball and do n't perform to the level expected , then someone else is going to take their place			0
' in training , you can see the standards have improved , and that can only hold us in good stead , really			0
