@entity1 ’s devilish duo of @entity2 and @entity3 were on hand to inspire future @entity7 boss @entity6 ’s side to victory against @entity9 in @entity10			1
the @entity11 , so impressive during their 5 - 1 thrashing of @entity14 in their opening group b fixture , made hard work of what many believed would be a routine win			0
@entity19 and @entity3 , in particular , raised their performances when needed in the second half though , as @entity1 overturned a 2 - 1 scoreline to make it two wins from two			1
leap of joy : @entity2 celebrates scoring as @entity1 defeat @entity9 3 - 2 at the @entity29 @entity31 strike : @entity2 recovered from a sluggish start to score @entity1 's second goal the magic number : @entity7 striker took his @entity29 tally to three goals in the group stage video @entity11 fans celebrate following five - goal thriller red alert ! @entity6 ( @entity42 ) and @entity2 will be showing their talents for @entity7 next man hug time ! @entity2 congratulates @entity45 after he scores the wining goal the @entity7 forward ’s booking shortly after the break seemed to spark him to life			1
the yellow card means he will miss @entity1 ’s final group match against @entity55 , but within minutes of his foul for a stray elbow he had drawn the @entity11 level with an emphatic finish into the roof of the net			2
despite the goal taking him to eleven in his last 10 appearances for the national side , van @entity2 ’s goal came as quite a surprise after an abject first - half performance			2
the @entity7 attacker was anonymous in the first half , completing just a single pass as @entity1 were outthought and outmuscled by their opponents			2
a fine individual goal from @entity3 gave @entity1 the lead in the 20th minute , before former @entity77 star @entity76 equalised for @entity9 with an outrageous first - time volley			1
going @entity11 : @entity2 ( @entity42 ) lines up with his @entity1 teammates ahead of the game in @entity81 the future is @entity1 : @entity1 fans get into the spirit of things as the game against @entity9 kicks off carnival time ! @entity1 fans fuse @entity90 @entity89 costumes with their traditional colours a handball from @entity1 full - back @entity93 gifted @entity9 a penalty , with captain @entity96 making no mistake from the spot , sweeping the ball past @entity100			1
it was then that @entity101 came to the rescue			0
the striker received a pass inside the @entity106 box , turned instinctively and then smashed a shot past @entity108			0
minutes later @entity1 were ahead through @entity45 , the 20 - year - old beating @entity108 with a speculative effort from distance that bounced in front of the keeper and nestled in the bottom right corner			2
captain fantastic : @entity2 lines up against @entity9 in the tunnel before kick off catch me if you can : @entity2 speeds away from @entity9 's @entity120 in the first half flying @entity11 : @entity2 had a lacklustre first - half - only completing a single pass pull the trigger : @entity2 lines up a shot against @entity9 in their second group game at the @entity29 that 's a blow ! obin van @entity2 is floored after a challenge with @entity131 ( ground l ) @entity133 set @entity1 up with the exact same team that beat @entity14 so convincingly last week			1
yet they struggled to reproduce the intensity of that performance , as @entity9 dominated the first half , with @entity76 causing mayhem inside the @entity11 box			0
watch @entity9 and you know exactly how they are going to score			0
their full - backs and wingers try and hit @entity76 in the air at every opportunity			0
there were warning signs for the @entity11 early on , but they seemed to switch off after going ahead through @entity3			0
one minute and nine seconds later @entity76 equalised with a finish @entity2 would have been proud of			0
tunnel vision : @entity1 manager @entity6 waits with his players before walking out to the @entity153 words of advice : the future @entity7 manager speaks to defender @entity157 concern : the @entity11 manager looks on after @entity160 is taken off on a stretcher with serious injury the @entity164 attacker let a long diagonal drop over his shoulder and then lashed a volley in off the bar with his supposedly weaker foot			1
@entity1 improved considerably all over the pitch after the break , with their defence breathing a collective sigh of relief when @entity76 was withdrawn midway through the second half			0
@entity133 showed tactical flexibility by abandoning his five - man defence in the second half in favour of a flat back - four			0
this gave @entity1 a solidity they had been lacking before the interval and allowed them to deal with @entity9 ’s considerable aerial threat			2
a number of reported @entity7 targets were also on show for @entity1			1
@entity190 , who revealed he would find it difficult to turn down an approach from his national boss , drifted in and out of the game , while left - back @entity157 again impressed , grabbing his third assist of the tournament to set up @entity3 in the first - half			1
flash : @entity3 sped through to open the scoring for @entity1 with his third @entity29 goal in @entity90 @entity201 lived : @entity9 equalised within a minute after a wonder goal from @entity76 video top 10 goals from @entity204 on the spot : @entity9 captain @entity96 gave @entity9 the lead with a penalty following a harsh handball			1

@entity1 came back to defeat @entity9 3 - 2 in their @entity212 game
