@entity1 's education reforms have suffered a fresh blow after his flagship policy of giving universities a say over the content of @entity7 was discontinued			1
he wanted universities to take ' ownership ' of the exams by dictating their syllabus and reviewing them annually			2
the reforms were designed to address concerns from academics that a-levels were not rigorous enough to prepare students for university			1
the failure to commit to a continuing academic - led review might be viewed as the latest weakening of mr @entity1 â€™s reforms since he was sacked as education secretary in july last year it is understood the board , formed of academics at @entity28 universities , will soon be registered as a dormant company after a decision by @entity31 ( pictured ) , minister of state for education but the @entity33 formed 18 months ago to oversee this process has been mothballed , it has emerged			1
the decision by education minister @entity31 will be seen by some as the latest weakening of mr @entity1 's reforms since he was sacked as @entity36 last july			0
since then , his replacement @entity38 has been dubbed ' ms u-turn ' because of her differing views on key issues including grammar schools and pupil punishment			0
the @entity46 said the advisory board could be recalled , but its suspension is likely to disappoint many academics keen for the sector to retain a role in ensuring the exam 's rigour			0
although mr @entity1 had suggested all a-levels would be scrutinised , only three subjects underwent major reviews			2
some of the board 's recommendations were shelved after proving unpopular with teachers .			0

under @entity1 , universities were to take ' ownership ' of a-levels
aimed to address concerns from academics they were not rigorous enough
but now advisory body of *professors* to oversee this has been mothballed
