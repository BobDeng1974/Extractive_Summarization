a @entity1 mother who never gave up hope of finding her beloved son cried tears of joy as she was finally reunited with him - 26 years after child traffickers snatched the four - year - old from the street			1
@entity11 's son @entity10 vanished in september 1989 , taken from the street by two strangers who no one ever saw again			1
his disappearance left @entity16 distraught , and over the years she did all she could to find her little boy , writing nearly 10,000 letters and appearing on television countless times , always holding the only photo she had of @entity10 , taken when he was three years old			1
she even tried to infiltrate the child trafficker 's network , in the vein hope it might lead her to her son			0
yet in the end , it would be the picture she had showed to thousands over the years which would finally reunite her with the son who was living on the other side of the world , the @entity28 reported			2
tears of joy : @entity11 was reunited with her son @entity10 26 years after he was snatched from the street delight : @entity11 , 53 , had never given up hope - and the entire village turned up to celebrate the reunion shock : @entity10 , who was given a different name , had no idea he had been taken , thinking he was an orphan @entity11 decided to give the search for her son one final push after her daughter @entity50 was diagnosed with leukaemia			1
neither @entity11 nor her ex-husband were a match as bone marrow donors , but the 53 - year - old knew there was one last chance : the son she had n't seen for more than a quarter of a century			1
so @entity11 appeared on television once more - and this time , a man recognised the three - year - old in the picture as his friend , now called @entity64			1
but there was another hurdle : @entity67 was now living half way across the world in @entity70 , where he had moved a few years before to work as a driver			0
it transpired @entity10 had been brought up by a foster family more than 1,000 miles away in @entity74 , in the north of the country			0
he , like many other children in @entity1 , had no idea that he had not been orphaned , but snatched - so he had no idea the pain his mother was feeling back at home			2
small chance : @entity11 only had this picture of her son , aged three , to help with the search luck : the picture was seen by one of @entity10 's friends , who thought they could be the same person			1
pictured : @entity10 ( far right ) and his son , four , with his mother inspiration : @entity11 was spurred on to reignite the search after her daughter - pictured here with her brother and nephew - was diagnosed with leukaemia alone : @entity11 feared she would be left without a family - but instead managed got a new grandson @entity11 said : ' i was devastated - but the whole thing was made worse by the fact that everybody , including my husband , blamed me for losing our son			1
' @entity11 's husband was so desperate to heal the hole in their lives , he even brought another boy back to the house on one occasion			2
devoted : @entity11 , pictured here with her son , was so determined she once pretended to be a businesswoman to enter a child traffickers house in the hope it would lead her to @entity10 but @entity11 told him to take the young boy back again			1
' for all i knew this poor child could have ended up in the adoption process because of traffickers and i did n't want anything to do with it , ' she said			0
the stress led the couple to divorce five years later , and @entity11 was left bringing up their daughter alone			2
but her search continued , although it led to many false leads , with people trying to extort money from the desperate mother			0
at one time , she managed to trace a young snatched boy right to his new home - only to discover it was not her son , but that of a neighbour 's			2
@entity11 even disguised herself as a businesswoman to enter into the home of a suspected trafficker , but was exposed and had to flee			1
but @entity11 made the conscious decision to keep one vital piece of information secret , so she would not be tricked : a distinctive mole on @entity10 's face			1
so when the now - grown @entity10 's friend showed her a picture of her son as a 30 - year - old man , it was the mole which meant she knew for sure it was him			1
so when @entity10 returned to @entity1 to get his visa renewed , he took a blood test - proving he was the missing youngster			2
@entity156 : @entity11 , seen her with her daughter @entity50 , even once found the kidnapped son of a neighbour recognition : @entity11 and @entity160 were finally brought back together this week , to the delight of everyone large family : @entity10 is married , and @entity11 now has a daughter - in - law ( pictured ) and a grandson unbelievable : ' i never gave up hope , but it was getting towards the end of my life and i thought that maybe it was n't meant to be that we would be reunited in this life , ' @entity11 said it lead to a tearful reunion between @entity10 and @entity11 , as well as her grandson - who , at four , is the same age as @entity10 when he was taken			1
' i looked for my son for 26 years , and never gave up hope but it was getting towards the end of my life and i thought that although i know he 's out there somewhere , maybe it was n't meant to be that we would be reunited in this life , ' she said			0
' and it seemed as if everything was going wrong when my daughter was diagnosed with leukaemia			2
' i ca n't believe i have both my children back now , plus my son has got married and i even have grandchildren			0
' as for @entity10 , he is still trying to come to terms with what has happened			0
' i feel incredible , ' @entity10 told @entity192			0
' i did n’t know how to tell my current mother the news , i did n’t know how to face either			0
' but , one thing i ’m certain of is that my birth - mother must have endured so much			0
' @entity10 , who was raised with three older sisters and a younger brother , is also clear on his responsibilities to his mothers , even if he is n't quite sure how it will work			0
' i ’ll try to take care of both mothers , they are both my mothers			0
i ’m still coming up with a solid plan , and my birth - mother respects my choice , ' he said .			0
