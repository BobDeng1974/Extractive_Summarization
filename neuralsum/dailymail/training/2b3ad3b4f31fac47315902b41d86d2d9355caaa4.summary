scores of firefighters saved nine people from a burning mansion in @entity5 in the early hours of yesterday some 70 firefighters were battling the blaze in the early hours and attempted to control the flames from above taken away : crews removed valuable items and paintings from the house after they had controlled the flames she said : ‘ clearly these paintings belong to a serious collector of @entity47 art. ‘ one is almost certainly a @entity23 , one of his harbour scenes , maybe nightfall on the @entity90 painted similar views in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity5			1

‘ these pictures are in terrible frames and look like duds to me , bad production copies of @entity136 pictures acquired by the owners of the house , ’ he said			2
‘ i would have said they are worth a few hundred pounds at the most			2
’ @entity140 said firemen had told them they removed the paintings because the property ‘ looked like an art gallery ’			2
