by @entity0 a scientist discovered a new species of wasp less than a millimetre long living in a tree in his son ’s school playground			1
dr @entity9 , an insect expert at @entity11 ’s @entity10 , found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree			1
he said : ‘ i noticed some of the whiteflies looked slightly different to the others so i took them to the laboratory			2
when i saw the wasp inside i knew it looked different to anything i ’d seen before			1
’ dr @entity9 , an insect expert at @entity11 's @entity10 , found this @entity22 wasp living in a tree in his son 's school playground the 54 - year - old found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree five years ago - but tests to establish the wasp as a new species have only just been completed dr @entity9 , 54 , made the discovery five years ago at @entity34 in @entity35 , where his son @entity36 was a pupil			1
but rigorous tests to establish the wasp as a new species – named @entity22 – have only just been completed			2
the wasp , which dr @entity9 named after fellow @entity34 scientist dr @entity41 , is a parasitoid , meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects			1
the wasp is a parasitoid , meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects			2
an official description of the wasp was published last week he added : ' when i saw the wasp inside i knew it looked different to anything i 'd seen before but i thought it might be a species from @entity56 that had come over to the @entity57			1
i was really surprised when i realised it was native to the @entity57 and was previously unknown			1
' finding an undiscovered insect in the rainforests of @entity61 is relatively easy but the fauna of @entity63 is some of the most studied in the world so to find something new here is a real thrill , and makes it even closer to my heart			2
' and you never get over that thrill of peering down a microscope and realising what you 're looking at is something new			0
' initial dna testing showed the insect to be unknown anywhere on earth , but rigorous research and testing had to take place			0
the wasp had to be checked against other similar creatures and a detailed scientific description written before it could be confirmed			0
the official description of the @entity22 , which the species is now called , was officially published last week in the @entity87			0
dr @entity41 is chairman of trustees at the @entity97 which promotes taxonomic research to support biodiversity studies and conservation			0
dr @entity9 is a leading scientist who works at the @entity10 but 88 - year - old dr @entity41 , who has been studying mammals since he was nine , is no stranger to seeing his name associated with scientific breakthroughs			1
he said : ' i now have a flea , a bug , a sand cat and a wasp named after me , which is obviously quite an honour			0
dr @entity9 's wasp is a particularly interesting one - it was found right here in @entity112 just a few hundred yards from my home			1
' people have been studying the fauna of @entity57 for more than two centuries and these things do n't tend to happen very often			2
it shows how remarkable the environment can be you can find something so remarkable in the most ordinary place			0
' dr @entity123 confesses even though he 's travelled the world looking for insects he rarely walks past a plant - even in the @entity57 - without studying it for insects			1
he added : ' it sounds strange but it 's what i do			0
i 'm always looking at plants and the insects on them			0
' i work with some of the smallest insects on @entity135 , sometimes as small as a fraction of a millimetre long , so i 'm used to looking for miniscule things most people would n't even notice			0

leading scientist discovers a new @entity57 native species of wasp in @entity35
dr @entity9 made the discovery at @entity34
he thought bugs looked unusual so took them to the lab for closer look
