' an anonymous bidder bought the letter for £ 11,875 - three times its estimate - while a photograph @entity6 took of a young girl with a bucket and spade in @entity25 in 1882 fetched £ 5,250			1
@entity6 , whose real name was @entity6 , wrote the three - page letter to a friend he addressed as mrs @entity29 almost 30 years after first achieving fame for his @entity7 books			1
the author said he resented giving his autograph and hated people finding out his real name			2
he wrote : ' @entity36 , i do n't think i explained successfully my reasons for disliking letters of mine being put into autograph - collections			2
' all that sort of publicity leads to strangers [ underlined ] hearing of my real name in connection with the books , and to my being pointed out to , and stared at by , strangers , and treated as a " lion "			1
' and i hate all that so intensely that sometimes i almost wish i had never written any books at all			1
' he said he realised plenty of people ' like being looked at as a notoriety ' and could not understand why he used a pen - name and craved anonymity			0
but he went on : ' we are not all made on the same pattern : & our likes & dislikes are very different '			0

when he received letters addressed to @entity80 , talking about @entity6 , he returned them with a copy of the notice			0
it read : ' mr @entity6 ... neither claims nor acknowledges any connection with any pseudonym or with any book not published under his own name '			0

the auction house had predicted worldwide interest from collectors of @entity7 memorabilia			2
revealing : the back page of the letter said he was different from those who craved publicity it comes after another letter by @entity6 emerged in 2008 , cryptically answering modern - day speculation as to whether he was a paedophile			2
written to the muse for @entity7 , @entity111 , it read : ' thank you for the sight of the pretty photographs , but do n't keep the child in for me - i am fearfully busy - and what could [ @entity6 's contemporary ] miss @entity117 have been thinking of to say such things of me ? ' she must have taken some remark of mine about liking children and have said to herself for " some " read " all " , for " girls " read " boys " and for " ten " read " two " - such a method of exaggeration is wholly unfounded			2
' @entity7 , depicting the journey of a young girl through a fantasy world , was published under the pen name @entity6 in 1865 by @entity131 rarities : the auction also contained an unpublished letter from @entity135 to his publishers discussing the difficulties of completing @entity138 , the third part of his famous @entity142 trilogy the author 's own illustrations were replaced by those of @entity146 , a more accomplished artist already famous for his work on @entity148			1
