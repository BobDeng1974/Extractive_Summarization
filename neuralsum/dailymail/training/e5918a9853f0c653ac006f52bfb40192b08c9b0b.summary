@entity5 , a primary school teacher , said : ' it was a bit like a military operation , we had a big map with all the piers detailed on each so we could see which were near each other to visit			2
' we could only do it on the weekends so we had to make sure we got in as much as we could			0
' we had to plan all our routes in detail but it was worth it , especially for the kiss at each one			0
' we learned so much about each pier , about how it was made and how it came to be			2
they were huge places back in their heyday so it was fascinating to find out all about them			0
' now , after completing their adventure , @entity5 has written a book detailing their journey			1

' the pier at @entity107 was shut to the public because it needed a lot of repairs doing to it , ' said @entity5			1

she said : ' the pier is so quirky and yet so quintessentially @entity146			2

' we have a soft spot for @entity159 as well			0
we had hoped to marry on @entity15 's pier but it was n't to be because they had n't rebuilt it in time			2
