' the vet could n’t believe his injuries were so minor after such a fall			0

it was his enthusiasm that got the better of him - but he will be on a lead in the future			0

two - year - old *plunged* into the shaft while out on golf course with owner

@entity3 *responded* and was rescued with only minor injuries and in good spirits
