by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 29 august 2012 sir @entity1 last night launched a dramatic court bid to prevent the government stripping him of his lucrative rail franchise			1
the @entity6 boss is seeking a judicial review of the decision to hand a 13 - year franchise to run the @entity10 to rival @entity11 , which bid £ 2billion more			1
his move came just hours before transport secretary @entity13 was due to formally sign off the deal with @entity11			2
sir @entity1 branded the government ’s decision this month ‘ insane ’ , claiming @entity11 bid too much and will either pull out of the franchise early or go bust			1
the billionaire entrepreneur appealed to @entity29 to intervene , and called for the contract to be examined by @entity31			0
miss @entity13 yesterday insisted the process had been ‘ fair ’			0
yesterday @entity33 , which has operated the @entity10 line since 1997 , said the procurement process had ‘ ignored substantial risks to taxpayers ’			0
on the legal challenge , @entity11 said : ‘ there has been no complaint about the process , which was carefully described in advance , until @entity43 had lost			1
’ following the @entity10 decision by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , transport secretary @entity13 had been due to sign off the contract this week			0
@entity6 is now hoping that its legal challenge will delay the signing			1
in the past few days , @entity19 and members of the @entity50 said they hoped the final signing could be deferred until the matter could be debated in @entity53			0
@entity11 chief executive @entity54 insists the company will deliver on its winning bid the business magnate has repeatedly expressed concerns that @entity11 would not be able to live up to its financial and service - providing targets for @entity10			1
the tycoon said : ' we had hoped that @entity53 or an external review would be able to scrutinise this badly - flawed process before the franchise was signed			2
' in a statement , @entity6 said yesterday : ' @entity67 ( @entity67 ) has yesterday commenced court proceedings in respect of the decision to award the @entity10 franchise to @entity11			1
' we have tried for three weeks to get clarity over the @entity45 ’s decision and to have a number of key questions answered			0
on each occasion we have been refused information			0
' we are left with no choice but to commence court proceedings as we believe the procurement process has ignored the substantial risks to taxpayers and customers of delivering @entity11 ’s bid over the course of the franchise			1
' @entity6 went on : ' in addition it ( the process ) has ignored the @entity45 ’s own assessment that @entity67 ’s bid was more deliverable and a lower risk			1
we question whether @entity11 ’s bid has been correctly risk adjusted by the department given all of its supposed incremental value is delivered after 2022			1
' the current process is geared to selecting the highest risk bid and needs to be independently audited to prevent a repeat of former franchise failures			2
' the billionaire said hopes of a @entity102 or external review would be denied ' if the @entity45 follows through with its determination to rush through the process before @entity53 returns next week '			2
he added that signing off the franchise now ' ignores the wishes of more than 150,000 people who signed the @entity109 e-petition in 10 days , the @entity110 , two important commons committees and many backbench conservative mps who wanted a debate before the decision is taken , not a post-mortem afterwards '			0
sir @entity1 said : ' we have not taken this decision lightly , but it is the only course now available to try to unravel this sorry process			1
' @entity43 has lost its @entity10 main line franchise to transport company @entity11 , in a bidding war which sir @entity1 branded ' insane ' such is his desperation for the decision to be reviewed , the @entity6 boss made an offer to run the @entity10 for free , allowing @entity53 time to scrutinise the decision , which the @entity6 boss calls ' outrageous ' , to award the franchise to rival @entity11			1
he has claimed that @entity11 's bid will lead to ' almost certain bankruptcy ' and made the last - ditch appeal to the government to delay signing the 13 - year contract on tuesday			1
he said @entity33 and @entity133 would operate the joint venture on a not - for - profit basis or donate profits to charity if the franchise needed to be extended beyond december for a few months to allow @entity53 to investigate the decision			0
transport secretary @entity13 had been due to sign off the contract this week responding to news of the legal challenge , @entity11 said yesterday : ' we have every confidence in the @entity45 ’s process which is rigorous , detailed and fair and in which bids are thoroughly tested			1
there has been no complaint about the process , which was carefully described in advance , until @entity43 had lost commercially			0
' @entity11 went on : ' our plans for the new @entity152 franchise include faster journeys , new trains , more seats and more direct services from @entity157 than currently on offer			2
' there will be improved wifi , better catering , refurbished stations and standard anytime fares will be reduced by 15 % on average within the first two years			0
we look forward to welcoming passengers to their new and exciting @entity152 service in december and creating a better railway for all			0
' our focus is to ensure a smooth transition with continuity for staff and passengers alike			0
we want to get on with delivering the many benefits and improvements we are offering without delay or disruption			0
we will continue to prepare for a successful start up of the new franchise on december 9			0
' the new @entity10 franchise will last for 13 years and four months , with an option to extend to a total of 15 years			0
last year , @entity6 , which more than doubled annual passenger numbers during its 15 - year stewardship of the line , paid a £ 168 million premium to the government on @entity10			2
the @entity11 bid is worth £ 5.5 billion at net present value , with @entity6 believed to have bid £ 4.8 billion			1
@entity11 ’s annual premiums will grow steadily over the course of its franchise			2
sir @entity1 fears that @entity11 will run into financial difficulties in the same way that two former operators of the @entity199 main line - @entity197 and @entity200 - did			1
he said that for @entity6 to have bid more on @entity10 ' would have involved dramatic cuts to customer quality and considerable fare rises which we were unwilling to entertain '			2
