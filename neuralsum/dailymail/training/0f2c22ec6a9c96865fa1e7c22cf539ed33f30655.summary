he blasted his way into the building and used a high - powered rifle to kill 20 children and six adults , including the principal who tried to stop him			1
but now it has been revealed he had more ammunition in the form of multiple , high - capacity clips each capable of holding 30 bullets , raising the possibility @entity3 had planned an even deadlier massacre and was stopped short			1
' there was a lot of ammo , a lot of clips , ' said state police lt. @entity38			2

' the chief medical examiner has said the ammunition was the type designed to break up inside a victim 's body and inflict the maximum amount of damage , tearing apart bone and tissue			0
mr @entity38 said that @entity3 had ' hundreds ' of bullets remaining when he killed himself in the school , and was in possession of multiple high - capacity magazines for all of the four guns he brought with him			1
@entity3 had a bushmaster .223 - caliber rifle and two handguns on his person when his dead body was found by police , and he also had a shotgun in the car parked outside of the building			1
' the bushmaster was used in the school in its entirety and the handgun was used to take his own life , ' mr @entity38 said in a sunday afternoon press conference			1
speaking on @entity73 's ' @entity72 , ' gov. @entity71 said @entity3 shot himself as police entered the building			2
' we surmise that it was during the second classroom episode that he heard responders coming and apparently at that , decided to take his own life , ' @entity76 said			0
@entity76 offered no possible motive for the shooting and a law enforcement official has said police have found no letters or diaries left behind that could shed light on it			0

all six adults killed at the school were women			1
of the 20 children , eight were boys and 12 were girls			1

' asked how many bullets were fired , @entity106 said , ' i 'm lucky if i can tell you how many i found			0
' parents identified the children through photos to spare them some shock , @entity106 said			2
the terrible details about the last moments of young innocents emerged as authorities released their names and ages - the youngest 6 and 7 , the oldest 56			2
witnesses say @entity3 was going from room to room shooting people , after first killing the principal @entity6 and the school psychologist @entity6 execution - style when they confronted him in the hallway @entity3 shot his mother , @entity127 , before driving to @entity6 shooting 26 people including 20 children they included @entity6 , a little girl who had just moved to @entity6 from @entity132 ; @entity133 , a 27 - year - old teacher who apparently died while trying to hide her pupils ; and principal @entity6 , who authorities said lunged at the gunman in an attempt to overtake him			1
the tragedy has plunged @entity6 into mourning and added the picturesque @entity143 community of 27,000 people to the grim map of towns where mass shootings in recent years have periodically reignited the national debate over gun control but led to little change			1
residents and faith leaders were sure to reflect sunday on the mass shooting and what meaning , if any , to find in it			0
