by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:58 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 26 june 2013 a divided @entity2 said tuesday that federal law does n't require that a @entity5 child be taken away from her adoptive parents and given to her biological father , meaning that the girl will be moved once more			1
the girl was put up for adoption by her mother and was raised by a @entity13 family for more than two years before the state 's courts cited an old law - intended to protect @entity5 families - and forced the girl to be put in the care of her biological father , who has @entity5 ancestry			1
@entity13 courts said the 1978 @entity22 favored the biological father of the girl , named @entity25			1
but the @entity13 couple who raised her for the first 27 months of her life appealed that decision			0
happy family : @entity31 and @entity32 were in the delivery room when @entity25 was born in @entity34 in september 2009 justice @entity35 , writing for the court 's majority , said the federal law did n't apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of the child and abandoned her before birth			1
@entity35 also said the law does n't stop @entity46 from adopting the child when no other eligible candidates stepped forward			0
the law ' does n't apply in cases where the @entity52 parent never had custody of the @entity52 child , ' said @entity35 , who was joined in his opinion by chief justice @entity55 , and justices @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
' @entity60 would put certain vulnerable children at a great disadvantage solely because an ancestor – even a remote one – was an @entity52 , ' @entity35 said			2
' a biological @entity52 father could abandon his child in utero and refuse any support for the birth mother – perhaps contributing to the mother 's decision to put the child up for adoption – and then could play his @entity22 trump card at the eleventh hour to override the mother 's decision and the child 's best interest			1
' i 'm always going to be her daddy ' : @entity81 and daughter @entity25 met for the first time on @entity83 2011 ‘ if this were possible , many prospective adoptive parents would surely pause before adopting any child who might possibly qualify as an @entity52 under the @entity22			1
' the court 's 5 - 4 decision sends the case back to the @entity13 courts			0
but justice @entity91 dissented and pointed out that the court 's ruling does n't mean the baby , whose is only known publicly as @entity25 , will now go back to her adoptive parents			2
september 2009 : @entity25 is born in @entity34 , with the @entity96 present at the birth january 2010 : @entity98 signs away his custody rights but days later files an appeal december 2011 : @entity25 is handed over to her biological father after a family court in @entity13 grants him custody july 2012 : @entity104 upholds the custody decision april 2013 : @entity106 @entity2 hears an appeal from the @entity96 july 2013 : court sides 5 - 4 with the adoptive family ' the majority does not and can not foreclose the possibility that on remand , @entity114 's paternal grandparents or other members of the @entity116 may formally petition for adoption of @entity114 , ' she said			1
' if these parties do so , and if on remand , @entity122 's parental rights are terminated so that an adoption becomes possible , they will then be entitled to consideration under the order of preference established in ' federal law			1
her dissent was joined by justices @entity130 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
@entity91 said the court 's decision turns the law ' upside down , reading it from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is manifestly contrary to @entity141 ' express purpose in enacting @entity22 : preserving the familial bonds between @entity52 parents and their children and , more broadly , @entity52 tribes ' relationships with the future citizens who are ` vital to ( their ) continued existence and integrity			1
' added @entity130 in a separate dissent : ' this father wants to raise his daughter , and the statute amply protects his right to do so			0
there is no reason in law or policy to dilute that protection			0
' the @entity161 administration , 18 states , several @entity52 tribes , current and former members of @entity141 and children 's welfare groups filed briefs in support of the father			2
the future of @entity171 is being discussed at the @entity106 @entity2 on tuesday the @entity172 and the @entity173 were among the groups that filed briefs in support of the @entity13 couple			0
@entity81 , a member of the @entity116 , invoked the federal law to stop the adoption arranged by the girl 's @entity181 mother when she was pregnant and the @entity183 , @entity13 - area couple , @entity31 and @entity32			1
the couple was present at @entity25 's birth in @entity34			0
@entity81 had never met his daughter and , after the mother rebuffed his marriage proposal , played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after @entity25 was born			2
but when @entity81 found out @entity25 was going to be adopted , he objected and said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions			2
@entity13 courts agreed and @entity81 took @entity25 , now 3 , back to @entity34 at the end of 2011 , even though she had lived with the @entity96 for the first 27 months of her life			0
@entity198 , president of the @entity141 , said the court 's decision leaves the @entity22 in place , which he called ' the most important law to protect native children and families			2
' busy week : the @entity2 has been handing down a number of important decisions this week ' while we are pleased the court has upheld @entity22 , we 're very disappointed for @entity81 , @entity25 , and the @entity98 family that the court has ruled to send the case back to the @entity13 courts on a technicality , ' @entity198 said			1
' however , the courts in @entity13 have previously affirmed that @entity81 is @entity25 's father and that he is a fit parent			2
we are confident that his parental rights will be upheld , and that @entity25 will stay with her family			0
' @entity91 said ' the anguish this case has caused will only be compounded ' by the court 's ruling if another change is made in the girl 's living arrangements			0
' @entity114 has now resided with her father for 18 months , ' she said			0
' however difficult it must have been for her to leave @entity226 's home when she was just over 2 years old , it will be equally devastating now , if at the age of three and a half , she is again removed from her home and sent to live halfway across the country			0

biological father @entity81 was able to gain custody of his daughter after invoking @entity22 of 1978
federal law gives @entity52 parents preference in custody *battles*
judges ruled in favor of adoptive family saying the father abandoned her at birth and had no legal rights to her as a result
comes during busy week for the @entity2 who also ruled on affirmative action and *voting* rights
