‘ the betrayal is so incredibly intense that nothing you have prepares you for the emotions			0

and so it ’s just really hard to camp on one particular emotion , ’ @entity37 told @entity38			0
good samaritan : former clinic worker @entity54 called the @entity37 family to tell them that their dog was alive and used for experiments the mother of two from @entity14 said her pet , which was supposedly terminally ill , was able to walk and jump into her minivan on his own when she came to rescue him			1

the @entity86 has launched an investigation to determine if any other animals were mistreated at the clinic			0
late wednesday afternoon , dr @entity17 spoke out in his own defense , calling the allegations against him ' a bunch of hooey			1
' speaking to the @entity96 , the veteran medic said that it was mrs @entity13 who wanted her dog euthanized , but he could not bring himself to do it			0
@entity17 also said @entity54 , who contacted the @entity37 family about their dog , was just a disgruntled former employee who wanted to get back at him			2
the former @entity81 staffer , however , insisted that she quit her job because she could not continue working in a place where animals are mistreated			0

the veterinarian even kindly offered to bury the 5 - year - old @entity2 on his farm			2
the family gave @entity17 the green light to euthanize @entity4 , and even brought their son , @entity133 , to the clinic to say his final farewell to the four - legged friend			2
‘ so i brought him [ @entity133 ] in and had our tearful goodbyes , and we went over very specifically our plans for burial of @entity4 , and that was the end of it , ’ @entity13 recalled			0
then on april 21 , out of the blue mrs @entity13 got a call from @entity54 , a former employee at @entity81 , who told the woman that dr @entity17 never euthanized @entity4 , and instead he has kept him around as a plasma donor for other pets			1
‘ i remember coming in and them extracting blood from @entity4 , and basically shaving him , extracting his blood for the other animal upstairs , ’ @entity165 said to @entity166 , adding that the dog was kept locked up almost the whole time , denied treatment and he had been injured by another worker			0

' according to @entity4 's owner , the pooch still has rehabilitation ahead of him , but an mri has confirmed that he never had a congenital spinal defect			1
@entity54 revealed that there was also a cat that dr @entity17 was supposed to put down because he had abscess in his mouth and could not eat			1
‘ dr @entity17 changed his name to @entity227 , had us put him in the dog ward and left him there , and this time that i came back in in 2013 , he 's still there , ’ said the former clinic staffer			1
