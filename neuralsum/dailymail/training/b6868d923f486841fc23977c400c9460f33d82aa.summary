by @entity0 making a splash : @entity2 of @entity3 has been taking one - year - old @entity4 for swimming lessons in the private pool at @entity7 the teenage queen finessed her breaststroke there			1
a young prince @entity10 sailed toy boats across it			0
it ’s where prince @entity14 learnt to swim — and now @entity4 goes there for his weekly splash about			1
for , as the @entity19 recently revealed , the @entity18 has been taking one - year - old @entity4 for swimming lessons in the private pool at @entity7 , a place steeped in history and tradition			1
over the past 76 years , nearly every member of the firm has learnt to swim in the pool , which has survived bomb damage and outlasted a king			1
yet apart from one photograph taken during @entity32 , when the pool was bombed , it remains an extremely private place of leisure for the @entity36 , with no publicly available images of the interior			1
indeed , the only clues to its design stem from a letter that sir @entity43 , from the @entity44 , wrote to @entity45 in 1938 when the pool was being designed			2
he requested the @entity48 ’s approval for the lining and walkway around the pool to be made of vitreous mosaic tiles rather than the glazed variety as it was ‘ less harsh in appearance and less slippery ’			2
enclosing samples of the tiles , he suggested the edge be marked in black mosaic with two bands of green , one below the level of the water and another near the bottom of the pool , to add ‘ sparkle and liveliness to the water ’			2
as his design suggests , the pool is certainly not extravagant , and it has none of today ’s usual trappings of a jacuzzi , sauna or sunbeds			2
prince @entity43 still swims there every day			0
although , perhaps surprisingly , it is n’t just the blue - blooded windsors who enjoy the privilege of bathing there			0
according to royal author @entity84 , members of the @entity83 can use the pool at ‘ certain specified times ’ when no member of the royal family wants to swim			1
although , of course , there is a special protocol			0
‘ the rule is that if a staff member is swimming and one of the @entity36 appears , they have to get out , unless invited to remain , which often happens , ’ @entity84 says in his book , not in front of the @entity98 : @entity99			2
‘ if when the staff member turns up a @entity101 is already in the pool , the servant , and this includes senior members such as the private secretary or @entity107 , will not attempt to join them			1
it ’s a rule that seems to work well and these days the @entity110 is the only permanent royal resident at the @entity7 who still uses the pool regularly			1
’ staff are also only allowed to swim in a minimum group of three , in case anyone gets into trouble — so that one can stay with the casualty and the other raise the alarm			2
and while there is no strict clothing code as such , the natural decorum of @entity7 residents mean you will not see overly revealing swimming attire			1
steeped in history : over the past 76 years , nearly every member of the firm has learnt to swim in the pool ( circled ) , which has survived bomb damage and outlasted a king but its newest attendee , @entity4 , is a particularly special guest given that the pool was conceived by the newly crowned @entity45 to guard the privacy of his daughters princess @entity137 and princess @entity138			1
he commissioned it when the family was adapting to its newly public role two years after the abdication of @entity144 ,			2
‘ while they were still living at @entity151 , the @entity150 had been enjoying swimming lessons at the @entity153 and no one had taken much notice of the two little girls in their regulation swimming costumes , ’ writes @entity145 , wife of former @entity147 chancellor @entity146 , in her book @entity149			1
‘ but now that princess @entity137 was heir to the throne they attracted too much attention			0
‘ so in summer 1938 it was decided to build ‘ a swimming bath and squash court on the north side of the @entity7 in one of @entity167 ’s conservatories			1
’ @entity171 architect @entity170 , then a 26 - year - old employee of @entity169 , produced drawings for the @entity174 pavilion — on the right - hand side of the palace and designed by renowned architect @entity167 in the 19th century — to be converted into a pool			2
though little is heard or told of the pool now , its construction was covered in the press at the time : ‘ when princess @entity137 and princess @entity184 returned to @entity7 with @entity45 and @entity137 from @entity185 recently , they found a big surprise awaiting them in the palace grounds , ’ read one newspaper article , dated january 14 , 1939			1
privacy : the newly - crowned @entity45 ( right ) built the pool so his daughters @entity193 and @entity138 ( front ) could continue their swimming lessons without attracting too much attention ‘ the surprise was a new swimming pool , which was specially constructed for the two little princesses so they may have their weekly swimming lessons next year at their own home			1
‘ while the @entity204 was in @entity171 , workmen were busy digging out the pool , which is a full - sized affair with the bottom and walls of thick concrete , and now they are engaged on the final process of tiling			2
the pool will , it is hoped , be ready for the princesses to have their first swim in it in the spring			1
princess @entity137 , who has been having lessons for about three years , is already a fine swimmer and this year she passed with honours her test for a life - saving certificate			1
‘ her younger sister , princess @entity184 , although she has not been learning to swim so long , is already proficient			2
almost every weekend during the summer , the princesses have races and games in their other pool at @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227			0
’ water babies : after the war , the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim with prince @entity10 and @entity233 ( pictured with their parents in 1953 ) both took their first strokes there the future @entity238 was already an adept swimmer as she and her sister had been taught at a young age by veteran swimming teacher @entity241 , of the @entity153 , who also trained their aunt , the princess royal , at the leisure centre near their former home at 145 @entity151			1
miss @entity241 never got into the pool but taught her pupils the motions by lying on a wooden bench , before they got into the water			0
she then tied a rope around the young princesses ’ waists and pulled them along on a wooden pole , gradually releasing the rope until they swam unaided			0
@entity138 , who was younger , plumper and clumsier , was at a disadvantage			1
‘ you look like an aeroplane about to conk out , ’ her sister once joked			0
and when she clung to the edge of the pool , @entity137 told her : ‘ do n’t be a limpet			0
’ ‘ the then princess @entity137 showed no fear of the water either in swimming or diving and went on to an advanced level , winning a silver medal for life - saving when she was still a very young girl , ’ added @entity84			0
however the two young princesses barely had time to enjoy their gift before @entity32 broke out			0
on september 10 , 1940 , a year after the pool was completed , it was damaged during the @entity272 by a delayed - action bomb			0
the @entity274 was not in residence when the bomb exploded , shattering the windows in the @entity278 — although four days later they were in an upstairs sitting room at the @entity7 when it was hit for the second time , by five @entity282 bombs , sparking the @entity238 ’s famous remark : ‘ i ’m glad we ’ve been bombed			1
now i can look the @entity285 in the eye			0
’ photographs survive of @entity45 and @entity137 inspecting the damage with the prime minister , @entity289			0
on the back of one picture , the @entity45 wrote : ‘ bomb exploded at 1.25am tuesday september 10			0
every window broken on all floors			0
the only exception is swinging lamp under garden entrance canopy			0
’ after the war , the pool was rebuilt and a second generation of royals learnt to swim — prince @entity10 , @entity233 , prince @entity302 and @entity303 all took their first strokes there			1
but it was an eight - year - old prince @entity10 who decided it was the perfect location for an alternative hobby : sailing model boats			0
he even invited fellow pupils from exclusive @entity315 prep school @entity313 — where he spent two terms , the first member of the royal family to attend school rather than be tutored privately — to trek a mile down the road to join him on his adventures			0
early start : both prince @entity10 and princess @entity322 splashed about in the pool teaching @entity14 and @entity324 to swim			1
prince @entity10 revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age fellow pupil @entity329 , 65 , said later : ‘ we all made small model boats in woodwork and @entity10 invited us to the swimming pool at @entity7 to sail them			1
as we went to launch ours , he brought out his replica of the @entity336 was not fair at times			0
’ in later years , princess @entity322 regularly used the pool , leaving home at 7am in a scarlet tracksuit and driving from @entity340 to @entity7 for a 20 - minute swim			1
leaving her bikinis for holidays , she donned a one - piece to swim up to 30 lengths of breaststroke , crawl and backstroke , to limber up for her day			0
like most dedicated swimmers , @entity322 was loath to miss her early morning exercise			0
at @entity349 , which has no pool , she drove to the nearby @entity351 , often taking @entity352 with her for an hour ’s swim followed by aerobics			2
she even swam in the @entity7 pool on the first day of her official separation from the @entity10 and retreated there for a solitary swim on christmas day that year			1
in happier times both @entity10 and princess @entity322 splashed about in the pool teaching @entity14 and @entity324 to swim			2
prince @entity10 revealed later that he had instilled a love of water in his eldest son from an early age			0
‘ i threw him in the swimming pool on occasions , ’ he said			2
‘ instead of putting him off , it enthused him			0
’ now @entity4 is splashing around in the pool — perhaps the most exclusive stretch of water in @entity370			1
@entity0 is author of @entity18 : the making of a princess .			0

@entity4 has swimming lessons in the pool at @entity7
over the past 76 years nearly every @entity101 has learnt to swim in the pool
there are no publicly available images of the private pool *'s* interior
