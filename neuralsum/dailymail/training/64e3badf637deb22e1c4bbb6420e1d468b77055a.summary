by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 13:08 est , 29 august 2012 jailed @entity1 can keep his household luxuries a cannabis dealer who embarked on a ' life of @entity6 ' can keep his haul of luxuries - after claiming he paid for them with his £ 14,400 a year in state handouts			1
jobless @entity1 , 27 , claimed extra welfare payments due to his epilepsy but topped up his benefits by buying and dealing in cannabis - and then splashed out on a range of electrical goods			1
when police raided his house , officers discovered it was stuffed with high value electrical goods , including a large fridge freezer , a 47 - inch flat screen tv worth £ 700 with surround sound systems , an @entity25 and a dvd player			1
they also found two expensive leather sofas in the lounge and designer clothing and footwear and a @entity32 vacuum cleaner			0
@entity1 had also had a £ 44 a month virgin subscription for his tv and had a gym membership for himself and his unemployed brother @entity36 , 21 , who was said to be his carer			1
at @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity1 claimed he paid for everything in the house and for his cannabis with his income support , housing benefit and carers allowance and with the help of his mother , who assisted him financially when he was ' struggling			1
' but despite him facing having the luxuries confiscated under @entity51 laws a judge was told police and prosecutors did not want to pursue it - with no reason given for the decision			2
mr recorder @entity56 , @entity57 , said he was ' stuck with ' the prosecution ’s decision not to have a proceeds of crime investigation and said his hands were tied - but he did rule that @entity1 made the money from drug dealing			1
police believed it would not be worthwhile investigating whether it could seize all of @entity1 's household luxuries as officers had already confiscated £ 1,000 in cash they had found in his pocket			2
it means @entity1 will still be able to enjoy the expensive goods when he is freed after serving just four months of his eight month jail term after he admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply			1
the money and drugs were confiscated			0
earlier the court heard police went to @entity1 ’ home in @entity38 last september and found four men - one of whom was under the influence of cannabis			1
living the high life : the jobless cannabis smoker said his state handouts paid for his luxurious lifestyle , which included flat screen tvs , @entity32 hoovers and an xbox console ( his possessions are not pictured here ) the officers discovered 140 grams of cannabis worth £ 1,400 in different parts of the house , but mostly in a tv unit in the lounge and in a kitchen cupboard and also 32 bags			1
@entity1 also handed the police a £ 1,000 bundle of bank notes from his pocket , telling them there was ' just over a grand ' and had pointed to the tv unit , saying there was cannabis in it			2
@entity1 was interviewed and told officers he used between £ 20 and £ 30 of cannabis a day but claimed he paid for his heavy drugs habit and the luxury items from his benefits and with the help of his mother			1
he said his brother was his carer , received carer ’s allowance and had no other income			0
@entity1 admitted to smoking ten cannabis joints a day - but said he did not profit from the habit ( pictured posed by model ) the hearing was told each month , @entity1 had £ 300 in housing benefit , £ 660 in income support and £ 275 in carer ’s allowance , paid into his bank account			1
he was said to get a higher level of benefits because of his disability			0
his monthly outgoings , including his cannabis habit , a £ 44 @entity133 subscription , gym membership and £ 340 rent , came to about £ 1,300			1
the defendant had claimed he paid for his heavy drugs habit and the luxury items from his benefits and with the help of his mother			0
@entity1 had admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply , on the basis he would sometimes sell drugs to friends only at cost price and did n’t make a penny			1
but a trial was held over the facts in which the prosecution had successfully argued he must have been making money as he was living beyond his means and there was no other explanation for his lifestyle and the cash			0
@entity157 , prosecuting , said ' it does n’t make sense for him to be simply giving cannabis to friends at cost price			0
he has n’t got enough money coming in from his benefits to pay for his cannabis habit			0
@entity38 @entity165 was told about the cannabis smoker 's lavish lifestyle - but did not confiscate his haul of luxuries ' clearly the defendant must have been profiting from drug dealing			2
there is no other explanation for the lifestyle and the cash			0
' giving evidence , @entity1 said he was on medication for his epilepsy and suffered seizures often			0
he said he tried to buy cannabis in bulk to get it cheaper			0
@entity1 said he smoked 10 joints a day and mixed cannabis with cigarettes			2
he told the court : ' i only put a bit of tobacco in , as nicotine kills you			0
' sentencing the judge mr recorder @entity56 , @entity57 , said he was ' stuck with ' the prosecution ’s decision not to have a proceeds of crime investigation and added : ' there must have been a commercial element , to enable him to live a lifestyle beyond the means provided by the state			1
' ' benefits are not intended to fund a drug habit of between of £ 150 to £ 200 a week			0
the benefits were intended to provide for the necessities of life , to ensure that he is clothed and fed and provided for			0
' ' you sought to minimise the extent of your drug dealing to try and explain away all the expensive goods at your home			0
' you suggested you borrowed money from your mother from time to time , but it was apparent the figures did not add up			0
the judge said @entity1 had been caught red - handed , had ' lied comprehensively ' to the court about the circumstances in which he had been supplying cannabis and his financial circumstances			2
@entity221 said @entity1 ’s epilepsy had not interfered with what was ' otherwise an active and luxurious lifestyle			1
' the judge continued : ' the public would be appalled if epilepsy were allowed to excuse you a jail sentence when you were still able to go a gym and enjoy all the trappings of a drug dealer ’s lifestyle			2
