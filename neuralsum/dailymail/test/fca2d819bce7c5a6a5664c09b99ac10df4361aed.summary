if @entity1 manage to overturn the 3 - 1 @entity3 quarter - final first leg scoreline handed to them by @entity5 last week , @entity0 will have his eyes on a very special record			1
should @entity9 's side go all the way and claim this season 's title as @entity14 champions , @entity0 will become only the second player to win @entity14 football 's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at @entity20 and @entity21			1
the only other player to have done so is @entity24 legend @entity23 , who lifted the famous piece of silverware for @entity27 , @entity21 and @entity24			2
@entity0 could become only the second player to win the @entity3 with three different teams @entity0 in action during @entity1 's 3 - 1 @entity3 quarter - final defeat against @entity5 last week it is quite an achievement , and one that the @entity33 maestro recently admitted to thinking about			1
' there is one player who has won three champions @entity36 with three different clubs : [ @entity23 ] @entity23			0
of course it is in my mind			0
the end of my career is near , ' @entity0 told @entity44			0
' i do n't have many years left but it is one of the targets			0
it is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the @entity3 is special , ' he added			0
@entity0 won the @entity3 in his first season at @entity20 when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005			2
and last season he was part of @entity55 's side to take the title , even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over @entity61			0
@entity0 celebrates winning @entity63 's top club prize in his first season with @entity20 in 2005 @entity0 ( on the ground ) scored the equaliser for @entity20 during the 3 - 3 against @entity24 before the @entity68 club won 3 - 2 on penalties @entity70 - @entity5 ( 2004 ) , @entity71 ( 2012 ) @entity72 - @entity5 ( 2004 ) , @entity71 ( 2012 ) @entity73 ( 2008 ) @entity21 ( 2014 ) @entity74 - @entity5 ( 2004 ) , @entity75 ( 2006 ) @entity76 - @entity75 ( 2006 ) , @entity77 ( 2010 ) @entity78 - @entity1 ( 2001 ) , @entity79 ( 2008 ) @entity80 - @entity81 ( 1996 ) , @entity82 ( 1997 ) @entity84 - @entity83 ( 1991 ) , @entity81 ( 1996 ) @entity85 ( 1993 ) , @entity81 ( 1996 ) @entity86 - @entity27 ( 1995 ) , @entity79 ( 2008 ) @entity87 - @entity24 ( 1994 ) , @entity21 ( 1998 ) @entity88 ( 1993 ) , @entity24 ( 1994 ) @entity89 - @entity83 ( 1991 ) , @entity24 ( 1994 ) @entity90 - @entity91 ( 1988 ) , @entity75 ( 1992 ) @entity92 - @entity93 ( 1986 ) , @entity83 ( 1991 ) @entity79 ( 1968 ) , @entity94 ( 1982 ) @entity95 - @entity77 ( 1965 ) , @entity24 ( 1969 ) @entity23 won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with @entity27 , 1998 with @entity21 and twice with @entity24 , in 2003 and 2007			1
at 33 and with a club as strong as @entity1 on a two - year deal under @entity9 , @entity0 could even attempt to match @entity23 's total achievement			2
@entity76 could also equal @entity23 's record if he manages to earn a @entity3 medal with @entity105 , but the 32 - year - old midfielder has his work cut - out as the @entity109 side trail to a 3 - 1 aggregate scoreline against @entity75			1
names to have retired with two @entity3 medals while at two different teams include the likes of @entity74 with @entity5 ( 2004 ) and @entity75 ( 2006 ) and former @entity114 goalkeeper @entity86 who had been part of the 1995 @entity27 squad before holding the trophy once again with the @entity118			0
midfielder @entity76 could would equal @entity23 's record if he were to win the @entity3 with @entity105 the @entity119 was suspended for @entity21 's @entity3 final victory against @entity61 last year @entity23 ( centre ) won four @entity3 with three clubs , including two with @entity24 the @entity124 midfielder celebrates with the famous trophy after @entity21 's victory against @entity81 in 1998			1

@entity0 won @entity3 with @entity20 and @entity21
he scored the vital equaliser for the @entity130 in his first season at the club
the @entity119 was in @entity21 's *triumphant* side last season
