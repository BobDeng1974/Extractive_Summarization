by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 13 september 2013 any allotment is a labour of love , requiring hours of meticulous effort and precise trimming to make it just so			0
but green - fingered @entity7 has taken precision gardening to a new level by creating a garden small enough to fit on a table - top			0
mrs @entity7 , 65 , who has tended a full - size plot for 10 years , shook up her local allotment society when she unveiled her creation - which mimics the full - size version in amazing detail			2
@entity7 's pristine plot measures just 34 inches by 16 inches the tiny allotment is an exact copy of the full - sized plot tended by @entity21 her mini-allotment , which is just 34 inches wide and 16 inches long , was lovingly constructed from astroturf , plywood , and even made tiny cuttings of plants to represent full - size flowers and veg			1
mrs @entity7 , a grandmother of four from @entity29 , @entity30 , is the secretary of her allotment society and came up with the tiny project for a horticultural show			1
she said : ' i just came up with the idea for something different - when i unveiled it they were very impressed			0
' mrs @entity7 crafted this tiny shed from plywood and roofing felt all of the replica plants are made of living material - the leeks are blades of grass , the cauliflowers are tiny flower buds and the beetroots are browning conifer leaves ' i 've always done lots of knitting but i 've never done anything like this before			1
‘ the shed is plywood with real roofing felt and the greenhouse is made out of clear plastic			1
the grass is bits of astroturf and the plants are real living plants , from bits of grass to flowers , for all the crops			2
’ ' it took me months ... you ca n't actually get veg to grow as small as that so it 's not really edible but it looks good			0
' mrs @entity7 started work on the project over a year ago and had it ready for the growing season			2
it will be on display in a local village show next week .			0
