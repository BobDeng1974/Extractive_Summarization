@entity0 has spent £ 6,000 installing three bike pumps a cash - strapped council has been slammed for spending £ 6,000 on just three bike pumps			1
@entity0 in the east @entity4 , has come under fire from local residents for splashing out on the ' ridiculous luxury			1
' the pumps , which are made by @entity9 , of @entity10 , cost around £ 2,000 to buy and install			1
@entity11 of the @entity12 said : ' taxpayers will be furious at this ridiculous waste of money			1
' at a time when councils across the country are pleading poverty , it 's ludicrous to waste quite so much cash on this scheme			2
' those at the top of the @entity0 need to sort out their priorities			2
' @entity26 , 81 , of @entity0 , said : ' when i was younger i used to race bikes and the very first thing you do is check your tyres			2
' i think most people have bike pumps now and i really do n't think they will be used that much			1
' it 's silly having them so close together as well			0
it should be moved further away , to the other side of town perhaps			0
' and they certainly are n't worth £ 6,000 - you can buy a pump for a quid			1
' the pumps have been placed outside @entity0 's @entity45 and council offices and a third will be situated at the city 's railway station @entity49 , 41 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' sometimes you wonder what planet these councillors are on			2
one minute they 're moaning because the government is slashing their cash and the next moment they are spending money on bike pumps			1
' @entity61 , 38 , from @entity0 , said : ' if the council had just made me redundant and then spent £ 6,000 on bike pumps i would be absolutely livid			1
it makes you think councils just ca n't be trusted with public money			0
' ' @entity69 , 59 , from @entity70 , @entity51 , said : ' i 'm all for encouraging people to cycle but these pumps are a ridiculous luxury when the country is supposed to be broke			1
in an age when people have to learn to be more self - reliant , you would like to think that would include being able to pump up your own tyres			0
' derby resident reacted angrily to the decision with one branding the bike pumps a ' ridiculous luxury ' @entity84 councillor @entity83 , cabinet member for @entity85 and @entity86 , said : ' the council 's cabinet has set aside around £ 6,000 from the @entity89 to fund a series of public bike pumps			1

' the pumps will fit varying types of valves and due to their high - volume capacity they can inflate tyres very quickly with little physical effort			0
' the pumps are free to use by all cyclists			0

' the first one was installed in the summer outside @entity45 , the city centre free secure bike park and cycle hub on @entity108			0
