the @entity7 established a strong position thanks to a ton from top - scoring @entity10 , yet @entity2 boasted a centurion of their own in @entity13 , who shrugged off injury to make 105 at @entity15			1
@entity16 was the pick of the bowlers with his four wickets maintaining belief @entity0 could restrict the @entity2 in @entity21			1
a late flurry from @entity23 , however , got the home team over the line as they recorded a three - wicket triumph			1

@entity63 ( 51 ) and @entity10 steadied the ship with a 90 - run third - wicket stand , before the former bottom - edged a @entity67 delivery to @entity57 at long - on			0
@entity57 then got in on the action with the ball , accounting for the wickets of @entity16 ( 23 ) and @entity71 ( 15 ) - both caught behind by @entity73			2
@entity74 contributed 40 and @entity75 11 before falling to @entity76 in the final three overs			0

@entity76 had contributed 39 runs before slicing to @entity102 at sweeper cover and succumbing to @entity106 @entity23 proved the matchwinner for @entity2 as he smashed a six and a four in back - to - back balls @entity86 followed in the 42nd over , @entity75 striking him in front of middle and leg			1
@entity57 's intervention meant the decision went to review , but @entity116 confirmed the end of his 56 - run stand			0
