on a cold monday in february 2012 , 46 - year - old @entity1 police officer @entity0 became a tragic statistic — one of hundreds of @entity5 patients injured or killed each year when medical devices fail			1
@entity7 , who was suffering from heart failure , was being rushed by ambulance from @entity10 for life - saving surgery in a specialist cardiac unit at @entity14 ’s @entity13			2
his failing heart was relying on a special pump — a portable version of an intra-aortic balloon pump , inserted into his main artery			0
in 2013 , there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog , the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries such pumps , which inflate and deflate a balloon in the artery , are used as temporary support for the heart in patients who are awaiting urgent cardiac surgery			1
but half - way through the 40 - mile drive to the hospital where the specialist team was on standby to perform an emergency operation , the battery powering his pump failed			1
@entity45 hospital documents obtained by @entity46 reveal that the battery , which had been fully charged before the ambulance journey , was faulty			0
with no spare battery on board , the transfer team from the @entity50 were helpless and the ambulance was forced to divert to nearby @entity54 , where the balloon had to be removed ( an inactive balloon can quickly cause blood clots to form )			0
later that day pc @entity0 was sent on to his original destination , but died the following day			0
an inquest into his death heard from a consultant cardiologist from the @entity13 who said it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ that the failure of the pump had contributed to @entity7 ’s death			0
the @entity50 also reiterated to @entity46 that its patient had experienced ‘ no clinical adverse effects ’ but had ‘ sadly died after a sudden deterioration in his condition ’			0
there is no doubt , however , that the failure of the pump did mean that @entity7 was not able to have the life - saving surgery he was meant to have			0
furthermore , after his death , the trust issued advice to all teams transferring patients with intra-aortic balloon pumps to carry a spare battery			0
it can be of no consolation to @entity7 ’s loved ones to learn that many other families ’ lives have also been shattered when medical equipment failed patients			1
the official figures for the number of @entity5 patients injured or killed each year by faulty medical equipment are shocking			1
in 2013 , there were 13,600 reports of failed devices to the watchdog , the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) — these were linked to 309 deaths and 5,000 serious injuries			1
the numbers are rising : over the past decade there have been almost 100,000 reports of failed devices , involving 2,300 deaths and 22,000 injuries			1
it 's difficult to shake the impression that medical devices are being rushed onto the market but these official figures could be just a fraction of the true human cost of unreliable medical equipment			1
for in a stunning admission to @entity46 , the @entity26 says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad			1
its experts have told us that , based on global research and work carried out following the scandal over the @entity124 breast implants ( which were made using industrial silicone with a high risk of rupture ) , they believe reporting of such incidents to be less than 20 per cent of the real figure — and possibly as low as 10 per cent			1
if this is true , this would mean in 2013 there were actually a shocking 68,000 adverse incidents , with 25,000 injuries and 1,545 deaths			1
@entity137 to the past decade , this produces a shocking tally that almost beggars belief : almost 500,000 incidents , 11,500 deaths and 110,000 serious injuries			1
asked if it would be reasonable to extrapolate the figures in this way , @entity143 , the watchdog ’s manager responsible for adverse incident reporting and medical devices , said : ‘ there ’s nothing new with that kind of analysis			2
the question is , of those incidents : were the serious ones reported ? ’ there was , he adds , no way of knowing			0
one of the reasons for this is an extraordinary culture of secrecy embedded in @entity164 law			0
under @entity173 20 of the 1993 @entity167 , ‘ all the parties involved in the application of this @entity167 are bound to observe confidentiality with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their tasks ’			2
in other words , the @entity26 ca n’t breathe a word			1
‘ we ca n’t give you which trusts and which medical device manufacturers were involved , ’ explains mr @entity143			2
’ that ’s why the @entity26 never named the manufacturer in an earlier death linked to a failed battery in an intra-aortic balloon pump			1
yet these two incidents were neither the first nor the last time this type of device has failed			2
on march 24 last year , @entity188 , a division of @entity191 medical technology giant @entity190 , urgently recalled more than 12,000 of its intra-aortic balloon pumps			0
it had received more than 100 reports that a simple design fault — a misshapen ring — was causing the device to shut down ‘ without any visual or audible warning ’			2
this could result in a sudden and potentially fatal loss of blood pressure			0
a patient died as a result			0
@entity190 issued a previous urgent recall for the same device in 2010 when it discovered the screens indicating the pump ’s performance tended to go blank			0
@entity208 , the communications manager for @entity190 , told the @entity209 : ‘ our products , by their very nature , are used in life - threatening and critical care environments countless times each day			2
' if we believe that any are not safe , or do not meet our specifications , we institute immediate corrective action and we will continue to do so			0
’ @entity190 is not alone : each year the @entity26 receives approximately 1,000 safety notices from manufacturers alerting the watchdog to problems with their products			1
yet while the @entity26 is not allowed to name the manufacturers , it was able to reveal that the most frequent failures have been in expensive , high ‑ tech equipment being used in critical situations , such as operations and in intensive care			1
the @entity26 is also allowed to name names and products when a reported failing could have widespread safety implications , issuing a @entity231			1
the @entity26 has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients but here , too , the figures are far from reassuring			1
in 2014 , 49 such alerts were issued			0
the most recent was on december 18 , warning of a risk of serious injury to babies in an infant warmer made by @entity243			0
a faulty retaining nut meant the heater unit ‘ may partially detach ’			0
in the past year , device manufacturers , including some of the biggest names , have issued close to 1,000 so - called field safety notices			2
they make for hair - raising reading			0
at one end of the scale was a wheelchair that might suddenly tip its seat backwards and an instrument for orthopaedic surgery so badly designed that it could n’t be cleaned properly , exposing patients to the risk of infection			0
more obviously life - threatening were faulty defibrillators , which are increasingly in the hands of inexperienced community volunteers			0
last year , the @entity26 issued an alert for one ‘ smart ’ defibrillator which advised life - savers to use too slow a rate of chest compression			1
another defibrillator incorrectly displayed a ‘ do not touch the patient ’ icon — which , according to the @entity26 ’s masterful understatement , ‘ could affect patient outcome ’			1
grave faults were also highlighted in pumps that automatically administer drugs to patients , a ventilator used to aid breathing during surgery and a software program for analysing ct scans			0
the number of @entity284 patent applications for medical devices doubled between 2002 and 2012 , outstripping applications from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors ( there are already 500,000 different types of medical devices being used in the @entity5 )			2
and it ’s difficult to shake the impression that these devices are being rushed onto the market insufficiently tried and tested			2
this is reinforced by the shocking number of times the @entity26 has had to send manufacturers back to the drawing board with devices that had been already used on patients			1
in 2013 alone , manufacturers were ordered to give 1,129 ‘ undertakings to improve designs , manufacturing processes and quality systems ’			0
and between 2011 and 2013 , production ceased on 143 products , said a spokesman , ‘ partly or wholly because of @entity26 intervention or because a company felt it did n’t want to make the necessary changes for commercial reasons ’			1
the @entity26 is prevented from telling us which ones			1
a spokesman for the @entity317 ( @entity317 ) rejected any suggestion products were being rushed out , saying they were ‘ put onto the market with processes backing them up to ensure they meet the correct standards ’			0
furthermore , monitoring the products after they ’ve been launched ‘ enables manufacturers to learn lessons from any field reports — if there is a situation identified by @entity26 or others where improvements need to be made , then manufacturers will respond to that ’			1
the number of reports of faulty medical devices involving new joints and this is perhaps the most shocking thing of all			1
for the regulation of medical devices is a bit like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted			2
under @entity164 law , private companies , known as ‘ notified bodies ’ , ‘ assess medical devices for quality , safety and [ check ] that they work ’			2
they then hand out the ce mark allowing these devices to be marketed in @entity284			2
thereafter , ‘ post-market surveillance ’ — essentially , waiting to see if something goes wrong — is used to identify any problems			0
in other words , everyone from the manufacturers to the @entity26 and the notified bodies seems to accept that device failures are inevitable — with patients serving as guinea pigs			1
the @entity26 says it is working urgently with @entity364 to eradicate the problem of under - reporting			1
in the meantime , following the @entity26 experts ’ revelations to @entity46 , the watchdog now says that its investigations have whittled down the number of deaths associated with device failures in its most recent official report from 309 to just 86			1
it is an extraordinary u-turn on its own published official figures			0
there is no doubt that the system is fundamentally — and potentially dangerously — flawed			0
‘ two things are certain , ’ says @entity381 , chief executive of the patient charity @entity382			0
‘ far too many people are needlessly dying or being harmed as a result of faulty devices or poor use of devices , and the reported incidents are still an understatement of how big the problem is			2
’ what we do know is clearly just the tip of the iceberg .			0

over past decade there have been almost 100,000 reports of failed devices
this involved 2,300 deaths and 22,000 injuries but could be just a fraction
the @entity26 says it fears the true toll could be more than five times as bad
most frequent failures have been in expensive , high ‑ tech equipment
