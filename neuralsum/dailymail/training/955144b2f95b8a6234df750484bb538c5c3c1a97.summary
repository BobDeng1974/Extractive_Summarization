roast dinner was named as the ultimate comfort food by 43 per cent of those questioned , beating steak and chips , scones with jam and clotted cream and apple crumble into second , third and fourth place			1

some 50 per cent of those questioned by @entity49 said a traditional roast was the dish they cooked at least once a month , beating spaghetti @entity53 at 49 per cent and curry at 43 per cent			1
currying favour : chicken tikka masala , long cited by many as one of the country 's most popular dishes came in at number 14 , having been beaten by pizza , lasagne and spaghetti @entity53 and despite not being able to walk down a high street without passing several coffee shops , the great @entity7 cup of tea still holds a place in the hearts of many			1

the survey also showed that while almost half of @entity7 still eat together as a household every day , at least two - thirds of them are watching at least one screen and a fifth are in front of two or more screens			2
time for tea : despite not being able to walk down a high street without passing several coffee shops , the great @entity7 cup of tea still holds a place in the hearts of many around half of people said they could confidently cook ten or more dishes from scratch but a full 10 per cent of the population say the can not cook a thing - including 16 per cent of men			1
the study also revealed that the horsemeat scandal appears to have had little impact on buying and eating habits			0

tv dinner : while almost half of @entity7 still eat together as a household every day , at least two - thirds of them are watching at least one screen @entity34 @entity33 editor @entity137 said : ' the impact of the horsemeat scandal has meant that people are more concerned about where meat is coming from			1
however it is interesting to note that more people are cutting back on meat consumption due to concerns about cost rather than the scandal			2
' butchers also do n't seem to be benefiting to any great extent			0
the vast majority of respondents only sometimes , rarely or never visit high street shops , with the perceived cost again being the most common reason			0
' what is of concern is that five million respondents say they are unable to cook a single recipe			0
we know that cooking is a feel - good activity , with large numbers of respondents saying they felt happy , comforted or inspired when cooking , so the more we can encourage people to cook , the better			2
' chef @entity165 said he hoped to see more men master the basics in the kitchen			0
' we can see that overall the nation 's cooking ability is good , but there seems to be a group who have n't ever learned the basics , including a disproportionate number of men , ' he said			0
