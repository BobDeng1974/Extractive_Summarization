by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 21 october 2013 when a 9 - year - old @entity2 , @entity4 girl recently turned on her new @entity6 princess walkie talkie for the first time , she was subjected to the filthy conversation of two truckers			1
no sooner had stepmother @entity10 popped batteries into the bright pink toy , than it began to spout profanity and even racist slurs			1
apparently the same frequency used by the toy is used by nearby trucker cb radios			0
no good , buddy : @entity10 demonstrates how her 9 - year - old stepdaughter 's @entity6 princess walkie talkie is stuck on a trucker frequency trucker talk : though it is pink and adorned with @entity6 royals , the toy began to spout profanity and racial slurs as soon as they popped in the batteries ‘ we picked up some things that she should n’t be hearing , or any child should be hearing , ’ the appalled @entity10 told @entity32 ’s @entity31			1
@entity10 declined to specify what her young stepdaughter heard , but foul trucker talk must have come as a surprise no matter how filthy			1
making matters worse for the girl : her walkie talkie only has one frequency , so she ca n’t shut the dirty talk off			0
not so sweet : ' we picked up some things that she shouldn ¿ t be hearing , or any child should be hearing , ' said @entity10 , though she did n't get any more specific frequently used : many common devices use the @entity54 frequency			2
unfortunately for the @entity10 family , so do cb radios used by many truck drivers according to the sticker on the back of the walkie talkie , it uses a frequency of @entity63			2
in addition to candy - colored kid ’s communication devices , the frequency is commonly used by remote controlled toy cars as well as wireless computer keyboards and mice			0
it ’s also used by cb radios			0
angry : @entity10 said she plans to contact the @entity73 about the issue @entity78 for citizen ’s band , the compact radios are well - known as the preferred method for long - haul truckers to relay information about traffic , police activity , and — unfortunately for the @entity10 family — their swarthy trash talk			0
@entity2 , @entity4 also happens to be near @entity85 , the @entity86 ’s busiest highway			1
@entity10 told @entity31 she plans to contact the @entity73 .			0

@entity10 of @entity2 , @entity4 was horrified to hear the filthy conversation between truckers spouting from the toy as soon as they popped in the batteries
@entity10 's stepdaughter can no longer play with the toy since it has only one frequency
