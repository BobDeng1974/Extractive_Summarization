by @entity0 published : 02:18 est , 16 june 2012 updated : 06:40 est , 18 june 2012 children are to be banned from a city centre under draconian plans to tackle anti-social behaviour			1
critics said the decision to stop anyone under 16 walking the streets of @entity9 after dark was akin to something ‘ you ’d expect in @entity12 , not @entity13 ’			1
police are introducing the curfew , believed to be the first time children have been banned from an entire city centre , to rid the area of yobbish behaviour			1
@entity20 : children will be banned from @entity9 town centre from monday as police and the council in the @entity26 attempt to tackle anti-social behaviour the strict rules , which apply between 9pm and 6am from today , mean anyone caught in the forbidden zone over the next six months could be jailed for three months or face a £ 2,500 fine			1
but parents and politicians have criticised the move , which they claim will ‘ criminalise ’ all young people			0
membership of sports groups , youth centres and even churches could be affected , they say			2
@entity40 , director of civil liberties campaign group @entity41 , said : ‘ the idea you could be fined or imprisoned for walking through the town centre simply because you are 15 and not accompanied by a parent is simply madness			2
‘ to say that anyone under 16 who is unaccompanied between 9pm and 6am is a criminal is the kind of draconian law you ’d expect in @entity12 , not @entity13			1
criminalising every young person in @entity9 – without any need for them to be engaged in any wrongdoing – is an unwarranted and disproportionate intrusion into the civil liberties of thousands of perfectly law - abiding young people			1
’ one mother , @entity59 , of nearby @entity60 , said : ‘ my son is 16 , our local cinema is 25 miles away			0
he would n’t be allowed to walk from the bus stop with these rules			0
’ councillor @entity66 , chairman of the people of @entity68 , said the curfew was a ‘ total over-reaction ’			0
‘ it is totally unjust and a massive over-reaction to do this to young people in the city , ’ he said			2
‘ the police are making out @entity9 is much worse than it is - believe it or not this is not the @entity77 we are living in			1
draconian : drastic new rules mean unaccompanied under - 16s will be banned from @entity9 town centre ‘ there does n’t seem to have been any consultation with the local community – everyone i ’ve spoken to thinks it is a bad move			1
’ banned areas include city parks , public areas and 24 individual streets			2
the curfew is being introduced despite claims violent crime has fallen by almost a quarter in the city after a previous measure which led to 110 individuals being banned from the area			2
@entity99 , the @entity100 , said imposing a blanket ban was ‘ heavy - handed ’ and an ‘ ineffective way of combating anti-social behaviour ’			0
‘ it demonises under 16s , isolates them from their communities , alienates them from police and spreads the misconception all young people are troublemakers , ’ he said			0
speaking on behalf of @entity114 and @entity115 , who are jointly introducing the measure , inspector @entity113 defended the move			0
‘ many people are working very hard to improve and regenerate the city centre as well as just wanting to enjoy their daily lives without being intimidated or harassed and i have no doubt dispersal order areas will assist in that endeavour , ’ he said			0
last night a ‘ @entity127 ’ @entity126 page had almost 1,000 members			0
@entity130 mp @entity129 , a minister in the @entity131 , said he would be raising the curfew with @entity133 , chief constable of @entity114 , later this week			1
‘ i am concerned we have a measure that is indiscriminately barring a whole section of the population from the town centre , ’ he added .			0
