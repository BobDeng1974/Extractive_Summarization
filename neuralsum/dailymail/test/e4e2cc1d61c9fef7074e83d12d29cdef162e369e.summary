a family has been awarded $ 150 million by a jury after a four - year - old boy was killed when @entity3 exploded into flames three years ago			1
jurors in @entity7 , @entity5 ruled on thursday that the @entity9 manufacturer , @entity8 , acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of @entity14 ' @entity13 with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle			1
@entity17 , of @entity18 , @entity5 , was killed when the jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck in march 2012			1
@entity14 ' @entity17 , four , was killed three years ago when his family 's @entity3 exploded when it was rear - ended this march 6 , 2012 photo shows the scene of a crash in @entity18 , @entity5 , where four - year - old @entity27 was burned and died when a @entity3 was struck from the rear by a @entity30 pickup truck the fuel tank leaked , engulfing the @entity19 in flames and killing the four - year - old			1
the verdict came nearly two years after @entity8 compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled - down recall of some older - model jeeps with the rear - mounted tanks			1
the tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind , making them susceptible to punctures and fires			0
federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash fires because of the rear - mounted fuel tanks			1
the jury of 11 women and one man , ruled after a nine - day trial that @entity8 was 99 per cent at fault for the crash and the pickup driver was 1 per cent at fault			1
jurors also determined that @entity8 failed to warn the family of the hazards of driving the @entity19			1
they ruled that the @entity59 should get $ 30 million for @entity27 's pain and suffering and $ 120 million for the full value of his life , according to a verdict form			2
@entity64 , spokesman for @entity8 parent company @entity65 , said the company is disappointed with the verdict and would appeal			2
@entity8 , he said , was prevented from presenting data submitted to federal safety regulators showing that the vehicles did not pose an unreasonable safety risk			2
' the vehicles are not defective , ' @entity64 said			0
although the verdict is large , it is n't the largest judgment ever against an automaker in a personal injury case			0
in 1999 , for example , a @entity80 jury ordered @entity82 to pay $ 4.9 billion to @entity83 and @entity84 after their @entity85 was rear - ended and burst into flames			1
in that case , four children in the back seat were severely injured			0
the family of a four - year - old boy who was killed when a @entity3 ( pictured ) exploded in 2012 has been awarded $ 150 million by a jury in @entity5 the amount was reduced on appeal to $ 1.2 billion			1
and in 2004 , a woman paralyzed when her @entity96 rolled over won a $ 369 million verdict from @entity98 that was later reduced to $ 83 million , which @entity98 eventually paid after exhausting its appeals all the way to the @entity104 @entity103			0
@entity105 , a professor at the @entity107 law school , said it will be difficult for @entity8 to overturn a jury verdict , but an appeals court might reduce the amount			2
he questioned @entity8 's decision to take the case to trial because of the horrific nature of the crash			2
@entity105 said the @entity17 verdict is likely to lead others to sue the company or to speed along cases that are already in the system			0
@entity8 has long contended that the @entity19 were no more dangerous than comparable suvs built at the time			0
it used that argument to convince the @entity125 in 2013 to allow it to recall 1.56 million jeeps after the government agency initially recommended that 2.7 million be repaired			0
under the recall , @entity8 agreed to install trailer hitches in the rear as an extra layer of protection			2
safety advocates have called the size of the recall and the fix inadequate			0
on thursday , @entity136 , the head of the @entity137 , called on the government to reopen its investigation against @entity8			0
@entity125 spokesman @entity140 said late thursday that the agency monitors legal decisions and ' if new information emerges , we take it into account and act appropriately			0
' @entity147 attorney @entity146 argued during the trial that @entity27 's death resulted from the fire because of the gas tank 's poor position			1
the child was on his way to a tennis lesson when the suv was struck from behind			0
' numerous witnesses saw @entity27 struggling to escape and heard him screaming for help , ' the family 's lawsuit alleged			1
the lawsuit alleged that @entity8 placed the gas tank in a ' crush zone ' behind the rear axle and knew the location was dangerous , and that the company failed to protect the gas tank against rupturing			1
trial testimony showed that the compromise with safety regulators over the recall was worked out in a @entity173 airport meeting between @entity175 @entity8 ceo @entity174 , former transportation secretary @entity176 and @entity177 administrator @entity177			0
@entity136 noted that @entity177 now works for @entity178 , a law firm that has represented @entity8 .			0
