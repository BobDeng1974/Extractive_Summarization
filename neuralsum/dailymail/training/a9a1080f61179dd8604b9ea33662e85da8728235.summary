swathes of @entity1 have been entombed in a four - inch thick layer of ice after @entity4 was hit by a freak blizzard			1
pylons buckled under the extraordinary weather conditions , leaving more than 35,000 households - up to 100,000 people - without power			1
the damage is expected to reach € 66million			1
but authorities are not yet able to reach more remote parts of the country which have been cut off as the transport network failed			2
anything which come into contact with the rain was soon covered in a thick layer of impenetrable ice			0
extreme weather chaser @entity40 took photographs of damage wreaked by the terrifying natural phenomenon			0
mr @entity40 , 32 , said cars , buildings , bridges , roads , trees , road signs and powerlines disappeared in the storm 's icy aftermath			2
deep freeze : trees are snapped like matchsticks under the weight of ice which have covered much of @entity1 @entity59 : an impenetrable layer of ice has enveloped vegetation after a record - breaking blizzard swept across @entity1 and parts of @entity4 ice storms strike in @entity1 every few years , but this one was ' extremely unusual ' and covered nearly the entire country , he said			1
mr @entity40 , from south west @entity1 , said : ' we 've been hit by a record breaking and historic ice storm			1
' it brought an extreme black ice accumulation , at some places there was more than 10cm of ice thickness			0
frozen solid : a car lies encased in a thick layer of ice as temperatures plunge in parts of @entity1 @entity83 : freak weather conditions meant rain turned almost instantly to ice as soon as it landed - encasing swathes of the @entity1 landscape in frost ' it was brought about by the valleys being in negative temperatures , while the upper levels were experiencing warm and above zero temperatures			1
' very heavy rain was falling for several days and rapidly freezing on everything			0
' ice storms happen every few years across some areas in @entity1 , but this one covered almost the whole country			1
' that 's extremely unusual and especially with so much damage done			0
' nearly half of all forests in the country were badly damaged or destroyed - that 's approximately 500,000 hectares of woods			1
' numerous electric poles and powerlines were brought down and more than 100,000 people went without power for several days			0
cold snap : the freezing weather brought transport links to a halt as ice made travelling treacherous ' railways were badly damaged too and it will take several weeks before they are all fully operational again			2
' some areas are still experiencing deep ice cover but it is expected to melt over the next couple of days as warm temperatures and rain are expected			0
' mr @entity40 , who lives in south west @entity1 , took the shots in the towns of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
the worst hit areas were those between 500 and 800 metres above sea level , he said			0
he added : ' the ice was very thick and strong , so much so that one could actually climb on it			0
' it covered everything from cars , buildings , bridges , roads , trees , road signs to powerlines			0
' i know it will take some days before it 's all completely melted			0
' clashing weather : a combination of a warm wet front meeting an unusually cold climate caused the rare ice storm to cover the landscape in stunning icicles treacherous : this steep descent , left , is made almost impassible by the ice storm which caused pylons , right , to buckle in the freak subzero temperatures mr @entity40 , who works as a supervisor on motorway road weather information systems , said his home was on the edge of the disaster			1
the damage to @entity1 's infrastructure caused by heavy ice in the past week will cost at least € 66 million ( $ 89 million ) , although extensive forest devastation could push the sum much higher , government ministers said yesterday			1
infrastructure minister @entity167 said damage to electricity powerlines was estimated at around € 27million , plus another € 10 million for the power distribution system			1
' the damage is extraordinary because of broken ( power ) cables , fallen trees			0
today we still have 35,000 households without electricity , ' @entity167 told reporters after a cabinet session			1
damage to the state railway was put at € 20 million , while the repair of roads could cost at least € 9 million , he said			2
brittle : the record - breaking blizzard covered hundreds of miles of road in a thick coating of ice isolated : government agencies have not yet been able to assess the true scale of the damage caused by the blizzard because swathes of the countryside are still cut off the devastation , which will take months to repair , occurred mostly in west @entity1 where a freak ice storm coated parked cars , petrol stations , street signs and houses and brought down electricity lines and trees			1
the extreme weather comes at a bad time for the tiny @entity207 member country , which is already going through the worst economic crisis in its two decades as an independent state , @entity1 narrowly avoided an @entity207 / @entity211 bailout last year			2
farming minister @entity212 said damage to forests , which cover almost 60 per cent of @entity1 , was staggering but could not be estimated just yet			2
' we can not remember ever having had this kind of damage , ' he said			0
a detailed assessment would be possible only after more than 6,000 kilometres ( 3,750 miles ) of backroads , clogged with snow , ice and fallen trees , are cleared			0
@entity212 said @entity1 would soon start talks on ' favourable , long - term loans ' with the @entity225 and the @entity226			2
local media reported that the government may also apply for funds from the @entity207 's solidarity fund , set up for major natural disasters in member states .			0
