@entity2 authorities have banned beach parties on some holiday islands to stop gatherings that can get out of control and lead to violence after the murder of two @entity10 backpackers last month , an official said on monday			1
the bodies of @entity10 @entity12 , 23 , and @entity13 , 24 , were discovered a beach on the tourist island of @entity16 , or @entity17 , on sept. 15			1
two @entity19 men have been arrested and charged with the murders			0
@entity21 , governor of @entity22 which includes @entity16 , said all beach parties would be banned with the exception of a @entity25 on @entity26 , following negative publicity after the murders			1
' this is aimed at tourists ' safety			0
sometimes these parties are held at secluded locations that are difficult to reach and where we can not offer adequate protection			1
' the ban on parties covers all islands in the province which , as well as @entity16 and @entity55 , includes @entity56			1
@entity21 said authorities on the islands were taking down posters advertising parties			2
' some people who come to the islands want peace and quiet but there are all sorts of parties , ' he said			0
police said the arrested men ( pictured ) had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves @entity73 murder detectives have travelled in secret to a @entity2 island where two @entity10 backpackers were brutally murdered amid concerns two @entity19 bar workers may have been wrongly arrested in connection with their deaths ' this is also because of the killings on @entity16 ... it 's time to put things in order			2
' police say @entity12 and @entity13 had been out drinking and went to a secluded stretch of beach where they were killed			1
their murders have dented @entity2 's tourism industry , which accounts for nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product , at a time when the sector is struggling to recover from months of political unrest and a may 22 coup			0
the police investigation has been tainted by suspicion the two @entity19 suspects may have been tortured during interrogation			0
@entity2 's human rights commission has opened an inquiry into allegations of police torture			0
but the @entity25 that attracts thousands of young foreigners every month , as well as its share of bad publicity , had dodged the ban as it was well organised , @entity21 said			2

@entity22 province , which includes @entity16 , is to ban all beach parties
the only one that will remain *allowed* is @entity25 on @entity55 island
@entity12 and @entity13 were murdered on @entity16 last month
governor says ban is for ' tourist protection ' as many beaches are *remote* and therefore difficult to ' offer adequate protection '
