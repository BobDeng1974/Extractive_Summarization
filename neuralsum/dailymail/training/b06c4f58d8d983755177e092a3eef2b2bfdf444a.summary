by @entity0 @entity1 had a theory			2
there were too many nuclear weapons in the world , he said , and not enough people being smacked in the mouth			2
@entity10 , by its very nature , resolves that			2
a lot of people get smacked in the mouth in boxing			1
yet it is not just the explosive small - scale violence that chimes with @entity1 ’s world view			2
what he was getting at , one presumes , is that many of the great conflicts and calamities of our age could have been solved by low level direct action a lot earlier			2
if a right - thinking person had put @entity30 on his backside in 1919 , do the fascists march on @entity32 in 1922 ? simple : forget the great conflicts and rivalries , one punch was all it took on saturday night for @entity37 champion : the @entity39 defended his @entity41 and @entity42 world super-middleweight titles after beating @entity43 a good right - hander , as thrown by @entity37 at @entity45 on saturday night , realigns even the most fervent uprising			1
and that reassessment was unavoidable once it landed			2
suddenly , @entity43 sat beside his conqueror for ringside interviews , a reduced , subdued , some would say broken figure			1
all the truth that was needed came in that right - hander			2
it told its own story : who was the champion , the better fighter , the winner and better man			2
@entity37 left @entity60 lying on the @entity45 canvas like a character from the cartoon @entity64			1
he fell as @entity66 falls : leg trapped beneath his body , arms splayed awkwardly			1
the difference being that @entity66 is animated with limitless possibilities for the effects of misadventure , while @entity43 ’ physical disorder was appallingly real			1
it was the doubled leg that offered the clue			2
nobody in command of his senses stays like that			0
referee @entity80 knew @entity43 was gone and called the contest off , immediately			1
floored : the way @entity43 was knocked out at @entity45 was similar to @entity66 from @entity64 ( below ) please : @entity43 pleaded with the referee to let the fight continue but it was far too late ... he 'd blown it @entity1 , tongue - in - cheek , imagined a swift , sudden end to confrontation , and @entity37 delivered it			1
around the ring , supporters of both men were shouting the odds , debating the points , calling the shots			0
some had @entity43 ahead , like one of the judges , but a good right - hander renders all previous notation or nuance irrelevant			1
who won the sixth ? suddenly , it did not matter			0
@entity1 thought a good punch might prevent the nuclear option , but there was something of the red button about the way @entity37 finished this fight , too			1
he modestly stated that he was not a knockout puncher — and not in a sly way of putting @entity43 down , either , although it no doubt provoked an inner wince from those with affection for the @entity118 — but one can not imagine many in the super-middleweight division , and a fair few heavier , that would have remained upright after that			1
it was a thing of beauty			1
each replay met with louder and louder gasps and groans from those watching @entity45 ’s big screens			0
it put one in mind of @entity133 ’s knockout of @entity134 in 2001 , another brutal right that ended a rematch , and a conversation			1
that 's got ta hurt : @entity37 's punch was a thing of beauty , similar to @entity133 ' on @entity134 in 2001 before the fight , opinion was divided about whether @entity133 had the heart , the will , the ability to regain his crown			1
@entity133 hushed that talk in four , @entity134 struggling to get up like a zoo animal hit with a tranquiliser dart			1
@entity37 said he had delivered blows as devastating , but not as momentous			1
‘ the history of the fight , the way people will look back on it in years to come , that was the punch that finished it off , ’ he said			1
‘ in that way , it was probably the best punch i ’ve landed in my life			2
it closed the show , and that ’s what world - class fighters do			0
‘ my legacy was definitely at stake			0
my career was over if i lost tonight			0
this was the biggest @entity170 fight in @entity171 and i did n’t want to be remembered as the loser of it			1
so this was one of the most satisfying nights of my life			0
i ’ve had the weight of the world on my shoulders , i ’ve had @entity43 in my ear for a year			1
‘ he was on at me before the @entity182 fight in may 2013			0
i have n’t heard the end of it			0
i knew within 48 hours of the first fight that this rematch had to happen			2
’ no other athletes are confronted with legacy talk like boxers			0
tough : the pair had to conduct post-match interviews after , with @entity37 admitting his legacy was at stake legacy : sir @entity195 was an exception of those who would have to face the questions @entity37 does typically , only men like sir @entity195 , three decades at the @entity202 coal face , field questions about their standing in the pantheon			1
the day @entity206 retires , or @entity208 , it will be considered , too			0
yet all boxers are required to assess			0
@entity37 is an outstanding fighter , among the best of his generation , yet he still dreams of a major fight in @entity213			1
there are two boxers out there , @entity217 and @entity218 of @entity219 , who would stand a good chance of defeating him			0
@entity217 , an @entity221 , has already done it			0
perhaps that is why @entity37 is respected stateside , but not revered			1
nevertheless , the legacy questions came			0
maybe , on a night when more than 80,000 filled @entity45 — and more seats could have been sold were the public prepared to have their view entirely compromised — it simply felt like a consequential occasion			0
@entity37 may yet fight @entity229 in @entity213 , but he is 36 now			1
his place in @entity171 boxing history is assured and he is mindful of timing his farewell			1
nobody wants to leave a loser			0
one more ? @entity37 may face @entity229 ( or others ) , his place in @entity171 boxing history is already assured the future is uncertain for @entity43 , but in a darker way			1
he was damned with faint praise by @entity240 , who spoke of him as a future champion , but only if he learned to operate within his limitations			0
he needs to target a weaker belt - holder , seemed to be the message			0
‘ it ’s about levels , ’ @entity37 said			1
‘ he ’s not quite got the toughness that you need at the top			0
i ’ve got ingredients that you ca n’t teach			0
if i fight @entity43 10 times i ’ll beat him 10 times			1
he ’s got to prove to me he can take more than one punch like that			2
he ’s missing the final ingredient , the ability to stand up against the top guys			0
i ’m not a one - punch man			2
i ’m a concussion puncher , but i flattened him tonight			0
’ another moment of reflection , and he made the baying , brawling , boiling vat of humanity that spilled over on @entity171 boxing ’s biggest night , suddenly seem a distant hum. ‘ when did i do it ? ’ @entity37 mused			1
‘ @entity268 eight ? that ’s another four - and - a - half rounds , 13 minutes or so			0
that ’s a long time to be in front of me with them little gloves on			0
’ a lonely place , the ring			0
maybe that ’s why mankind worked so hard to invent those big bombs			0
the hand - to - hand stuff was just too horrible .			2

@entity37 retains @entity41 and @entity42 titles in rematch against @entity43 on saturday
the @entity39 knocked the challenger out in eighth round with right hand
he left @entity43 laying on the floor like he was @entity66 from @entity64
the punch that settled it was a thing of beauty
similar to @entity133 ' on @entity296 in 2001
@entity37 will go down in @entity171 boxing history , regardless of any more fights
