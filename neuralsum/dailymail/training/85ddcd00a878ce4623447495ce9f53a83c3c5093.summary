the figures highlight the unequal improvements in health across @entity5 and will encourage calls for a ‘ measurement of wellbeing ’ as a marker of progress			2
the @entity48 says that although average life expectancy is rising across the region , increasing by five years since 1980 to reach 76 in 2010 , major inequities are found between men and women and between countries			2
the leading health risk factors for @entity5 today include tobacco and harmful alcohol use overall , life expectancy for women reached an average of 80 in 2010 , while that for men was 72.5 years			2
lifestyle and occupational differences largely explain this gap			0

and diseases of the circulatory system such as heart disease and stroke are the most important cause of premature death before the age of 65 , accounting for nearly 50 per cent of the total			0

@entity93 , @entity94 regional director for @entity5 , said : ‘ the @entity95 is undergoing important changes that are shaping health priorities , and the needs for disease prevention and care in the future			0
‘ the trends identified in this report help us to anticipate some of the challenges that @entity5 is facing and will face in the future			0
‘ but there are persistent and widespread inequities in health across the @entity109 , which in some cases are worsening			0
these are unnecessary and unjust and must be a priority for us to address collectively			0
