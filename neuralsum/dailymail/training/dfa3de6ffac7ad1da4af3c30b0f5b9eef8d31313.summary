lucy the beagle is a very naughty dog			0
but also a very smart one			0
while her owner , @entity3 , was out of the house , the dog was caught on camera strategically getting ready - to - eat chicken nuggets out of the hot micro-oven sitting on the kitchen counter			1
the video captures the beagle at first moving restlessly around the kitchen floor as she smells the food being cooked			0
@entity17 then moves around the dining table until a brilliant plan pops into her mind - the chair ! she strategically pushes the chair from underneath the table with her paw so it is close enough to the kitchen counter so that she can jump up			1
she balances slowly along the counter past the sink and opens the oven door with her paw			2
the oven is too hot inside to stick her nose in , so she uses her paw again to pull out the tray of chicken nuggets			2
they land on the floor and , hey presto , dinner is served ! the video has been seen by almost 300,000 viewers on @entity46			0
ca n't reach : the beagle is seen trying to scramble up the from the side of the counter but to no avail ... there must be a way : the dog circles the kitchen table looking for a way to get those nuggets one paw at a time : the dog pushes the chair out from underneath the table and gets it close enough to the counter she jumps up on the chair but realises she is standing in a difficult angle try again : she jumps down and gets in the right position she 's up ! the dog leaps from the floor to the counter top in two neat jumps open sesame : she expertly paws the oven door open come to mama : then she pulls out the tray on which the deliciously - smelling chicken nuggets await her salivating mouth on the floor : the goodies and tray land on the floor with a big crash dinner is served : @entity17 devours the nuggets in seconds			1
