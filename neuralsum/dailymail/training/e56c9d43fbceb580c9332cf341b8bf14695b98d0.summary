by @entity0 in the history of unlikely unions , @entity3 and the @entity4 must be up there with @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , and @entity10 and one of the @entity12			1
one local mp has called this @entity14 ‘ the biggest thing to happen to @entity3 since the industrial revolution ’ , and that is the sense one has in @entity17 , which on friday evening will host the teams ’ presentation in the @entity20 , and on saturday will witness the official start when the 198 riders roll out of the city en route to @entity25			1
this is the most distant and northerly @entity14 — a year after the most southerly , in @entity27 — in the @entity4 ’s 111 years			1
confident : @entity28 says @entity29 are in rude health ahead of the big race @entity33 service : the @entity34 is ready to defend his title in this year 's @entity4 favourite : @entity29 's @entity36 rider @entity28 has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey versatile : @entity28 ( in yellow ) is strong at climbing as well as time trials , which should give him the edge mentor : @entity28 ( right ) with @entity29 team principal @entity44 during the @entity4 video @entity28 & the @entity4 @entity3 have embraced the honour in a way never seen before.the @entity4 colours — yellow , green and red polka - dots , representing each of the three main jerseys — are everywhere , decorating @entity3 farms and even sheep			1
the county has caught yellow fever , with pubs adopting @entity59 names and @entity61 restaurants offering ‘ naan @entity62 ’ , though the @entity62 being honoured , @entity54 , will be missing			1
@entity59 ’s elite police force , the @entity65 , will escort the race in @entity3 , and on wednesday they cruised in on their gleaming blue motorcycles , along with @entity4 director @entity68 and five - time winner @entity69 , @entity59 ’s last champion , 29 years ago			1
just as predictable as another year without a @entity59 winner is a pre-tour drugs scandal , and on wednesday it was duly delivered			1
@entity72 , the @entity73 who rides for the @entity77 @entity76 team , confirmed he tested positive for probenicid at his national championships in february			0
@entity72 , who had a spell in the yellow jersey last year , released a statement saying that he aims to clear his name			0
‘ i had no knowledge of probenecid nor have i ever taken the substance knowingly in any manner , ’ he said			0
ready : sky employees from @entity17 unveil the world 's biggest jersey ahead of the @entity91 geared up : @entity3 will host the @entity14 , with @entity28 looking to retain his yellow jersey @entity28 , @entity36 ’s defending champion , is a former team - mate of @entity72 , having ridden with him on the @entity94 team in 2008 - 09			1
they also know each other from @entity73 , where @entity28 spent his formative years			2
‘ it was quite shocking this morning to hear the news about @entity72 , ’ said @entity28			2
‘ it ’s always harder when you know someone on a personal level			0
’ @entity28 has had his own problems in recent weeks			2
an illness at the @entity105 in early may meant he raced on medication that would normally be banned , but which was allowed thanks to a therapeutic - use exemption			0
then he crashed in his last outing before the @entity4 , the @entity110 , and suffered with the after - effects			2
‘ i ’m more or less recovered , ’ he said on wednesday			0
‘ i took quite a big knock to my left hip and there was a bit of underlying bruising there			0
i felt for the next week after the crash i just was n’t quite pedalling as i normally would			0
‘ it did take me a good week to get back into things , start seeing the same power readings as i would normally expect and be the normal me again			0
it was a reminder that anything can go wrong at any time , especially this first week of the @entity4			2
it ’s always a stressful environment being in the peloton over the first few days			0
i think given @entity3 ’s narrow , twisting , undulating roads on the first couple of stages it ’s going to make for some pretty hairy racing			1
’ absent : 2012 @entity4 winner @entity133 ( centre ) was not selected by @entity29 threat : @entity137 's @entity136 is @entity28 's most likely challenger in this year 's @entity4 @entity138 of stage 2 of the @entity4 @entity28 leads a strong @entity29 line - up , albeit one without @entity54			1
‘ just to make absolutely clear , i do not have a role in selection , ’ said @entity28 in response to a question about his famously frosty relationship with the @entity145 winner			2
@entity54 ’ presence would ‘ not necessarily ’ be uncomfortable , added @entity28 , but ‘ it would definitely change the dynamic having @entity133 on the team			1
that ’s bike racing : you ’re not always going to be best friends with everyone on the team all the time			0
‘ the team that i have got around me , ’ he added , ‘ i would say it is probably the strongest team that @entity29 has fielded at the @entity4			0

official start of the @entity4 will take place in @entity17
@entity28 is *hoping* to defend his title , but @entity133 is not racing
@entity59 ’s elite police force , the @entity65 , will escort the race in @entity3
