by @entity0 @entity1 , 62 , died from heart failure following a routine knee operation a 62 - year - old grandfather died from heart failure while undergoing a routine knee operation after @entity8 doctors failed to act when he showed signs of cardiac distress , it emerged today			1
@entity1 was assessed at the @entity12 in @entity13 and found to have an abnormal heart reading just a week before the procedure			1
but doctors went ahead with a total knee replacement even though he complained of chest pains in the anaesthetic room			1
and medics even refused to halt the operation when the father - of - three started showing signs of cardiac distress in the theatre			1
the grandfather - of - two suffered a cardiac arrest and died after being transferred to @entity26 just hours after the operation on february 9 , 2011			1
today his family received an admission of responsibility from the @entity12			2
expert evidence found a catalogue of failings at the hospital and concluded mr @entity1 would still be alive today if staff had halted the knee surgery			1
but his wife @entity36 , 54 , a former nurse , said she was furious she had received no apology for her ‘ needless ’ loss			0
mrs @entity39 , who worked at the @entity12 at the time of her husband ’s death , but has since left , added : ‘ i went to the theatre recovery room on my lunch break and it was unusually quiet			1
‘ i remember asking two nurses where my husband was and when i said his name was @entity1 , their faces just dropped			2
‘ i was told he would be transferred to @entity51 where they could treat him			0
‘ because of my job i knew the policy was that doctors can only transfer patients once they are stable so i hoped that was the case			0
‘ but when i arrived i was taken straight into the relative ’s room and was told @entity1 had suffered a cardiac arrest and there was nothing anybody could do , he had died			1
mr @entity1 complained of chest pains while in the anaesthetic room at the @entity12 in @entity13 but the operation went ahead without further investigation ‘ @entity1 ’s death has left a huge hole in all of our lives			1
‘ had they taken notice of his complaints of chest pain and carried out the necessary investigations he may still be here today			1
‘ whilst i am relieved the @entity12 has admitted liability , it wo n’t bring him back			2
’ mr @entity1 , from @entity79 , @entity80 , left behind his devastated wife @entity36 , his three children and two grandchildren			0
the part - time driver was referred to the @entity12 in 2010 by his gp after suffering from knee pain			2
doctors said he would need a complete replacement and a decision was made that he would stay awake during the surgery			0
but medics went ahead with the operation despite clinicians hearing him complain of chest pains and feeling unwell beforehand			0
the trust confirmed in writing that ‘ had the procedure therefore been discontinued when the deceased first developed chest pain it is likely that the arrhythmia would have been avoided and the cardiac arrest would not have occurred ’			1
the family are now in line for a compensation payout following the admission of liability			0
an inquest into mr @entity1 ’s death at @entity108 last year heard he was coughing as the operation began and his oxygen levels had dropped			2
as he struggled to breathe , cracking noises were heard through the stethoscope which was fluid leaking into his lungs , but the surgery continued			0
a coroner criticised the anaesthetic records at the hospital and recommended bosses use the case as an example in lessons to all of their staff on the importance of competent record keeping			0
and an independent review carried out by the @entity126 after mr @entity1 ’s death found a catalogue of mistakes had been made including ‘ extremely poor ’ record keeping			2
the probe also said the leadership by the senior anaesthetist was ‘ poor ’ and revealed the standard of pre-operative assessment was also ‘ poor ’			0
@entity135 , a medical law expert at @entity136 , who represented the family , said : ‘ there are clear guidelines in place on the importance of assessing a patient ’s pre and ongoing - surgery condition so there is no excuse for all of these points being noted as poor in the independent review that was carried out following @entity1 ’s death			2
‘ the evidence we obtained from medical experts was clear - a complaint of chest pain should have led to the surgery being stopped			1
‘ instead , a catalogue of failings meant mr @entity1 died a completely preventable death which has obviously been incredibly hard for his family to come to terms with			2
‘ whilst we welcome the admission of liability from the @entity12 we remain concerned at the lack of reassurance that lessons have been learnt and improvements made to protect patient safety in future			0
‘ the @entity1 ’s and future patients deserve confirmation that every possible step has been taken to prevent the same mistakes from happening again			0
’ during the operation the surgeons also failed to stop operating when mr @entity1 started to show signs of cardiac distress			1
the hospital has now admitted responsibility for his death @entity180 , chief executive of the hospital trust , said : ' the @entity12 apologises sincerely to the family of mr @entity1 for their loss and the on going distress this has caused			1
' the trust has admitted liability in this case for failure to discontinue the patient 's operation when there were clear indications that this should have been considered			0
' since 2011 the trust has put in place a number of measures to make sure the same mistakes do n’t happen again			0
' in acknowledging the findings of an independent review carried out by the @entity126 after mr @entity1 ’s death , the trust has developed a new method of pre-operative assessment where a consultant anaesthetist is available to consider pre-existing conditions likely to affect surgery and to call for additional tests as necessary			1
' we have extended and improved our training within the operating team and carried out a peer review of best practice , to improve communication			0
' we ’re carrying out an ongoing review of record keeping , and in several unannounced visits by the @entity219 ( @entity219 ) and @entity220 ( @entity220 ) improvements to our record keeping have been acknowledged on each occasion			0
