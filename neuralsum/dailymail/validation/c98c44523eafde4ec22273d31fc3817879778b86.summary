a spring training baseball game between @entity1 and @entity2 was held up by a pitch invasion of honey bees			1
the pesky visitors landed on the backstop netting and microphone during sunday 's game in @entity9 , @entity10 , causing quite a buzz			1
the unusual visitors delayed the start as an exterminator was brought in to deal with the swarm			2
not safe : the match between @entity1 and @entity2 was delayed when a swarm of bees traveled across the pitch and landed on the net ( top right ) bee swarms are common in @entity10 in march and it 's not the first time the @entity2 have had to deal with the flying nuisances			1

fortunately , they stayed there until we could get rid of them			0
' pitch invasion : the honey bees flew across the pitch and settled on the microphone and back netting in the match in @entity9 , @entity10 but @entity1 boss @entity47 was left a little saddened by the whole thing			1
he said : ' i 've never seen mass bee genocide like that			0
' all you have to do is get some smoke			0
trust me , i live in the country			0
' you take some smoke out there because the queen is in there somewhere , you get a @entity59 and suck them all in and take them out to the parking lot and let them go			0
' they 're just honey bees , man			0
there 's a decline in honey bees			2
