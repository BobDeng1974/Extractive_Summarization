@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s return to fitness will not result in @entity4 resorting to long - ball tactics			2
@entity2 could make his first start of the season against @entity8 on saturday after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in pre-season			1
@entity4 striker @entity2 has only made one brief substitute appearance this season the loss of the target man was viewed as a huge blow ahead of the season , but @entity17 ’s prolific form has helped @entity4 cope without @entity2			1
@entity17 is struggling with a back injury and that could open the door for 6ft 4in @entity2 to return			1
but @entity0 insists the @entity23 striker ’s selection would not signal an aerial attack			0
@entity2 's last goal for @entity4 was in the 3 - 1 victory over @entity27 last season ‘ we play slightly different in that we play more into @entity2 ’s feet than we do into [ @entity32 ] @entity31 or @entity17 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity31 and @entity17 are so pacy we are a massive threat in behind the opposition when the midfield players like @entity36 , @entity37 or @entity38 start sliding balls down the side of defenders			2
‘ @entity2 is not such a big threat in that area , he is a much bigger threat in terms of setting up attacks to get into the final third by playing into his feet or chest and not playing into his head			0
‘ no way do i tell a player to just knock it up to @entity2 ’s head			0
i want them to be talented enough to knock it into @entity2 ’s feet or chest			0
we want it on @entity2 ’s head when it is crossed into the box because that is where he is at his best and where he can score			0

the striker has recovered from an ankle injury sustained in pre-season
