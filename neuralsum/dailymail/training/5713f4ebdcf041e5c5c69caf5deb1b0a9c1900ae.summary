lurking in the streets of central @entity1 are a group of men who are being paid good money to do nothing more than just ape about ... literally			0
with their faces painted grey and white , they have adopted the antics of the langur species of monkey in order to scare away their pesky macaque cousins which break into houses , steal food and scare the living daylights out of residents			1
so the @entity20 has decided to turn the tables and put the frighteners into the cheeky raiders by setting the more ferocious langur monkeys onto them - even if they are only men in disguise			1
the plan appears to be working well			0
man dressed as monkey : a @entity33 worshipper in a @entity35 monkey god costume			2
the guards ' costumes are not dissimilar to this according to the @entity39 , the men - who not only disguise themselves as langurs but have also learned to shriek like them - leap out from behind bushes and trees and give their simian cousins the fright of their lives , sending them scurrying out of town			1
the human - into - monkey trick - reversing man 's evolution - has developed from an earlier practice of patrolling @entity1 's streets with real langurs that walked on leads with their trainers , particularly through the city 's posh neighbourhoods			2
but then the @entity59 government passed a law preventing langurs from being keep in captivity - and back came the bandit macaques to take up the pilfering where they had left off			2

monkey trouble : macaques have long blighted the streets of @entity1 , breaking into houses , stealing food and scaring the living daylights out of residents step up : the human - into - monkey trick - reversing man 's evolution - has developed from an earlier practice of patrolling @entity1 's streets with real langurs that walked on leads with their trainers , particularly through the city 's posh neighbourhood then came the idea of getting people to pose as langurs - and there was a ready team to do that			1
@entity96 , a monkey impersonator , rustled up a number of his friends and soon there were 40 of them ready to paint their faces , stick some fur onto their arms and legs , and start screeching at the macaque invaders			1
' i 'll growl at them or chase them with a stick , ' he says			0
time will tell just how effective the monkey men are , but early results are said to be promising			0
a senior official at the council said the practice was the only available option since the ban on keeping trained langurs came into effect			0
' these young men have trained themselves to pose as langurs , ' he said			0
' we have no option but to hire them because , as per law , even an officer who calls for a langur and its master to drive away monkeys can be booked and jailed , ' he said .			0
