@entity9 , who currently lives in @entity10 , filed suit against @entity12 's on friday , alleging the auction house had sold off the 300 - year - old , 34.65 - carat @entity16 diamond to an anonymous buyer on behalf of someone other than its rightful owner			1
named the @entity21 , the pink gem ' is one the rarest , perhaps most famous and illustrious pink diamonds in the world , ' according to the complaint filed in @entity27 supreme court			0

having just wed his second wife , @entity62 , @entity59 made a gift of the diamond - one that carried a caveat			2
@entity59 's new bride would ' not have unfettered access to ' her husband 's collection of precious stones , according to the complaint			0

prized possession : the jewel came into @entity9 's family 's possession when @entity59 ( pictured ) , the founder of @entity5 newspaper @entity60 , purchased the stone in 1961 high society : @entity59 ( right ) had a taste for precious stones , and was reported to have bought the diamond in @entity87 after losing big at the @entity89 casino the younger @entity9 agreed to let @entity62 hold onto the diamond ' because she was quite active and influential in @entity5 politics and sponsored political , social and business meetings at her home , ' a gift @entity59 bequeathed her in his will			1
