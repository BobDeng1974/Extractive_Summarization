@entity0 are set to impose a maximum power limit on gas and electric ovens next month which could threaten the sunday roast			1
an @entity6 ruling will require ' new energy efficiency requirements for ovens , hobs and range hoods ' by next month			1
officials insist it will cut waste and improve value for money , but critics fear it will take longer to warm up ovens to cook the sunday joint			1
new measures will be brought on february 26 for electric and gas - fired ovens			0
shops will still be able to sell existing models , but an eco-design directive will be introduced over several years			1
but the measures have been criticised by some @entity34 who say it is further evidence of @entity6 chiefs meddling in our everyday lives			1
@entity41 mep @entity40 told the @entity42 on sunday : ' if people want a low or high - powered oven , they 're quite capable of deciding for themselves			0
' if we banned all household appliances in @entity49 , it would still only cut carbon emissions by 0.5 per cent			0
' the planned changes follow a string of controversial energy - saving measures brought in by the @entity6 and aim to cut costs , improve competitiveness and reduce carbon emissions			1
new energy efficiency measures will be brought on february 26 for electric and gas - fired ovens ( stock ) energy efficiency limit for cavities of domestic ovens : within one year - less than 146 within two years - less than 121 within five years - less than 96 for domestic ( electric ) hobs : within one year - 210 @entity64 within three years - @entity65 within five years - 195 @entity64 new measures came into effect on january 1 which demand that everything from computer modems to ' smart ' televisions must have the ability to go into standby mode if no task is performed for several minutes			1
although coffee machines bought at @entity77 are likely to be exempt from the ruling , new ones must meet the stringent @entity6 energy regulations			1
but it could prompt another retail frenzy as people rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes			0
the @entity84 says the changes will save consumers money on their electricity bills and be better for the environment , but critics say it will leave people with cold coffee			2
the new rules state that drip filter coffee machines that have insulated jugs to keep the drink warm must power down their heated plate or element five minutes after brewing			0
those with non-insulated jugs must go on standby within 40 minutes of use			0
espresso machines should turn off after half an hour			0
@entity34 @entity40 said : ' if people want a low or high - powered oven , they 're quite capable of deciding for themselves ' @entity110 @entity109 mep @entity108 told the @entity111 : ' this is another example of how we are losing control over the smallest details of our affairs			0
' the @entity6 should really find something better to do			2
all consumers want more efficiency from household appliances to cut their energy bills but there is already enormous pressure from the market on firms to provide that			1
' @entity6 officials apply these blanket regulations from @entity0 without looking into the problems			1
' this really should be a matter for the industry , the market and , perhaps , national legislation rather than yet more interference from @entity0			2
' elsewhere , traditional lightbulbs have been axed and @entity49 barred powerful vacuum cleaners in september in what was later dubbed ' @entity139 ' and which sparked a stampede to buy high - power models in the @entity110			0
the directive banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and this will be further reduced to 900 watts by 2017			0
the @entity6 is also expected to impose limits on high - power hairdryers , irons , kettles , toasters and even lawn mowers			2
a spokesman for the @entity84 said : ' these policies save money , help tackle climate change and reduce energy imports from @entity159 and the @entity160			2

@entity6 will introduce new energy efficiency requirements for ovens and hobs
existing models will still be sold , but new design *gradually* introduced
officials in @entity0 say it will cut waste and improve value for money
but critics fear it will take longer to warm up ovens to cook sunday roast
