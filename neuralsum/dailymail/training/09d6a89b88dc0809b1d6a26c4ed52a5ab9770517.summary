when travelling abroad , the familiar sight of your favourite fast food menu can be a comforting thing			0
selecting your favourite burger from the board above the counter could leave you at higher risk of suffering a stroke , heart attack or heart failure , depending on where you are			2
a new study has compared 19 iconic products from global retailers @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , and found salt levels vary dramatically			1
experts have criticised the ' chaotic approach ' by manufacturers to the levels in various foods , which include a @entity27 , cornflakes , @entity30 burger , @entity31 and fitness cereal			1
and choosing a @entity34 in @entity35 means you are consuming almost 1g more salt than someone eating the same burger in @entity38			1
the international study , conducted by @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , highlights these vast disparities in salt content , prompting experts to call for the food giants to reduce their salt levels			1
the average daily recommended intake for an adult is currently 6g , but is set to reduce to 5g by 2025 on the advice of the @entity67			0
professor @entity68 , @entity58 chairman , and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity71 , @entity72 , said reducing salt levels in food is ' the most cost - effective measure ' known to reduce the number of people suffering a dying from strokes , heart attacks and heart failure			1
a number of the retailers told @entity85 salt levels in food is a ' complex issue ' which is ' influenced by a variety of factors , including culture and individual preferences ' , that are considered on a product - by - product basis			1
but while the variation may appear to be the result of different taste preferences , experts at @entity58 said the theory is disproved by the findings			2
a spokesman for @entity58 said : ' global taste preferences can not be blamed for the difference in salt content , as no one country consistently has the saltiest foods			1
' for example , the @entity104 has the most salty @entity19 's @entity106 , but the least salty @entity19 's @entity107			1
' @entity108 , international programme lead at @entity58 , said the study shows food retailers are able to make their products using less salt , but choose not to			1
a @entity17 original @entity115 in the @entity45 contains 3.5g of salt per burger , three times as much as the same product sold in @entity51 , which has 1.05g of salt per burger ' manufacturers are clearly able to make products with less salt , but deliberately choose not to , despite salt damaging their customer 's health , ' she said			1
' this study also highlights a lack of consistent nutrition labelling and portion size across the world which is adding to consumer confusion , as people can not choose the less salty options , even if they want to			0
' consistent front of pack nutrient labelling should be provided on all products to allow consumers to make better - informed choices			0
' she said there has been a positive change over time , with salt levels falling in some products since @entity58 last conducted the study in 2006			1
for example , @entity19 's cornflakes in @entity147 and @entity148 have seen salt levels reduce from 2.38g per 100g in 2006 to 1.30g in 2014 - a reduction of almost half the salt			1
a possible explanation is that the product is now being manufactured in the @entity155 , where salt targets have been set , and sold in @entity157			2
the @entity58 spokesman said : ' the fact that they ( salt levels ) are acceptable for consumers across @entity157 further highlights , quite clearly , that reductions in salt contents are not noticed by the population and can easily therefore be achieved across the world			1
' another finding of the survey was that salt levels in @entity172 six - inch sandwich has been cut in all countries included in the study			1
@entity19 's cornflakes sold in @entity176 contains 1.90g of salt per 100g compared to the same cereal sold in the @entity155 at 1.25g of salt per 100g - a difference of more salt than a standard packet of ready salted crisps the biggest reduction was seen in the @entity155 , dropping from 3g of salt to 1.7g per portion - a reduction of 43 per cent			1
meanwhile the salt content in a @entity30 has also fallen in all countries since 2006			2
in @entity35 levels have fallen from 3.83g to 2.3g salt per portion - a fall of 1.5g			1
but researchers said it is ' disappointing ' to note some products have not altered the levels of salt across in eight years			2
@entity198 levels in @entity19 's @entity107 cereal in the @entity104 and @entity200 has remained at 0.65g per 100g and 0.95g respectively			1
and in @entity35 a @entity201 's @entity27 still contains 2.55g salt per portion			1
alarmingly some products have seen salt levels increase since 2006			2
@entity201 's @entity27 in @entity51 , @entity206 and @entity207 has gone up in the last eight years			2
in the @entity155 the salt content of the @entity34 has increased on average since @entity58 's last survey , from 2.2g per portion to 2.64g - a 20 per cent rise despite calls to reduce the population 's salt intake			1
however ms @entity108 said the @entity155 is ' leading the way in salt reduction '			0
' the @entity155 has set salt targets for over 80 categories of food , however this survey shows that more still needs to be done , ' she said			2
@entity223 cereal has 2g of salt per 100g in @entity225 , while consumers in @entity227 can eat the same product with less than half the salt at 0.72 of salt per 100g ' it is also clear that greater focus needs to be put on the out of home food sector			0
' @entity198 should be going down , not up			0
' this is a major problem , especially with so many people grabbing food on the go			0
' professor @entity68 , said : ' reducing salt is the most cost - effective measure that we know to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from strokes , heart attacks and heart failure			1
' at the @entity249 in may 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30 per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day , by 2025			0
' our study has shown that many global food manufacturers are not doing enough to help achieve this target , which is completely unacceptable			2
' indeed this survey reveals a chaotic approach by these world renowned iconic brands and immediate action is required now			0
' @entity198 should be reduced in all their products to the lowest level in all countries , and further if we are really going to tackle the huge and burdening problem of strokes , heart attacks and heart failure			1
' these companies need to take a much greater corporate and ethical responsibility for what they are doing to their customers			0
' reducing salt levels in various products across the world is a ' complex issue ' , the retailers told @entity85			1
reducing salt levels in various products across the world is a ' complex issue ' , the retailers told @entity85 a @entity16 spokeswoman said the company , which operates in 98 countries , is ' committed to providing menu options ' to meet individual nutritional needs			1
she said they have ' successfully reduced the sodium content in many products around the world '			0
' as part of its global menu innovation process , @entity290 develops standards for its menu items , ' she told @entity85			0
' due to varying local regulations , @entity290 allows for some flexibility in its menu specifications in certain countries			0
@entity290 ’s approach ensures that all @entity16 restaurants have items that meet our stringent food quality standards in each region			0
' @entity305 , for @entity20 , said : ' @entity198 reduction in food is influenced by a variety of factors , including culture and individual preferences			0
' this is why @entity223 takes a product - by - product approach to its food reformulation efforts to cut salt			1
' he said the company has achieved a double - digit percentage reduction in salt from more than 2,400 @entity20 products , including cereals , since 2005 , when the sodium reduction policy was introduced			2
' the reduction since 2005 represents around 14,500 tonnes of salt and we will be doing more , ' he told @entity85			0
' we have set the objective to cut salt in our products by a further 10 per cent by 2016			2
' @entity223 also fully supports the @entity67 target for salt intake of no more than 5g per person , per day by 2025			0
' the challenge in all of this is to cut salt in our foods without consumers resorting to salt shakers or choosing saltier foods			2
this is why awareness raising of this issue and partnership with a variety of stakeholders , including governments , is so important			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity19 's added : ' since 1998 , @entity19 ’s has been engaged in a voluntary effort to reduce the amount of salt contained in our cereals in @entity157			1
' worldwide , @entity19 ’s is continually seeking ways to improve the nutrition profile of our foods – including lowering salt – without compromising taste or quality			0
' these plans vary by geography for many reasons , including raw material supplies , product renovation schedules and cultural and consumer taste preferences			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity18 brand said with more than 42,000 branches across the world , ' exact product formulation differs between countries dependent on specific suppliers '			2
' the @entity18 brand works hard to reduce salt wherever possible , not just in the @entity155 but worldwide			1
' a @entity201 's global spokesman , said : ' while @entity201 ’s is a global company , we operate as local businesses in a decentralised manner			0
' different countries have different menu choices , ingredient combinations , and portion sizes that depend on , for example , customer taste preferences , local regulations , local restaurant ingredient reporting requirements , supply chain capabilities , and the competitive marketplace			0
' @entity15 is working to reduce sodium in our menu items			0
' the timing and reduction amounts vary by country and menu item			0
because nutritional values vary around the world , @entity201 ’s markets have different baselines for measuring sodium content and different opportunities to reduce sodium			0
' he said they have made progress in @entity157 , where they have reduced salt in @entity408 fries by at least 20 per cent , and levels in @entity410 by 14 per cent			0
@entity85 has also contacted @entity15 and @entity17 for comment .			2

study carried out by @entity57 ( @entity58 ) surveyed products by @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity19
iconic food included @entity27 , @entity31 , @entity417 , @entity418 , @entity420 six - inch sandwiches
none of the 19 products showed consistency in salt levels across the world
@entity44 in @entity45 has three times as much salt as @entity51
@entity34 in @entity35 has 1g more salt than the same product in @entity38
@entity19 's cornflakes in @entity176 have 0.45g more salt than those in the @entity155 - equivalent to a standard bag of @entity439 crisps
@entity58 experts called on food manufacturers to cut salt content in all food
professor @entity68 said reducing salt levels is the ' most cost - effective measure ' known to reduce strokes , heart attacks and heart failure
