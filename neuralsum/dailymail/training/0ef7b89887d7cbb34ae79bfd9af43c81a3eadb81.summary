by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 24 january 2013 the @entity1 is failing to win over ethnic minority voters because it remains tarnished by the legacy of @entity4 , a @entity1 minister said yesterday			1
treasury minister @entity5 – whose father emigrated to the @entity7 from @entity8 in 1961 with just £ 5 in his pocket – said the @entity10 are still being hurt by their association with mr @entity4			1
in april 1968 , mr @entity4 , a member of @entity13 ’s shadow cabinet , delivered his hugely controversial ‘ @entity15 ’ speech which was widely condemned as racist			1
treasury minister @entity5 said the @entity1 party 's image had not recovered from the anti-immigration speeches made by former minister @entity4 senior government sources say that @entity22 is so concerned that the issue of race is damaging support for the @entity10 that he is planning to address it head - on with a speech in the next two months			1
the prime minister chaired a @entity30 meeting last week at which ministers were shown evidence that the single biggest factor in voters not backing the @entity10 is race – far outweighing wealth , class or where someone lives			2
but mr @entity5 ’s intervention , in an interview with @entity41 , will anger those @entity10 who bristle at any suggestion that the @entity1 are the ‘ nasty party ’			2
mr @entity5 said that when his father ’s friends were told that he had become an mp they assumed he must be representing the @entity49			0
mr @entity5 said @entity22 should give a major speech to improve the @entity1 's image with ethnic minority voters ‘ i said to him , “ @entity55 , why do you think that ’s the case ? ” he said “ i ’ll sum it up for you in two words – @entity4 ”			1
’ mr @entity5 added : ‘ the damage that was done to the party ’s image in the 1970s , particularly by @entity4 , is something we still have n’t been able to shake off			1
’ he said this will ‘ require the prime minister , someone of that standing ’ , to say @entity4 ‘ does n’t represent what the @entity1 is today in any way and to set out what the @entity1 actually is when it comes to race relations , multiculturalism and so forth ’			2
mr @entity4 was sacked from the @entity1 front bench after his speech in 1968 but many right - wingers believe he was prophetic about the effects of mass immigration on @entity7 society			2
mr @entity22 has already asked for ideas for a speech to combat the idea that the spirit of @entity4 is alive in the modern @entity1 and is seeking ideas for policies which will dramatise the common values between conservatives and non-white voters			1
conservative research shows that many ethnic minority voters share @entity1 values on the promotion of family and hard work			2
campaign bosses believe the @entity10 can boost their support with the @entity98 community and middle class voters of @entity101 origin			0
but they have been told by pollsters that they will struggle to win more votes from the black community and among poor @entity106 immigrants			0
mr @entity22 has already set up @entity107 of @entity101 and other groups to cement relations with the @entity8 and @entity111 communities			1
@entity4 was a senior @entity1 politician in the 1950s and 1960s , serving as a @entity113 minister and health minister under @entity115			0
but in 1968 he was sacked as shadow defence secretary by @entity1 leader @entity13 for a controversial speech on @entity119 immigration			0
he claimed that not all immigrants wanted to integrate in @entity7 , instead seeking to foster racial and religious differences ' with a view to the exercise of actual domination , first over fellow - immigrants and then over the rest of the population '			0
he added : ' as i look ahead , i am filled with foreboding			0
like the @entity130 , i seem to see " the @entity131 foaming with much blood "			0
' it became known as the @entity15			0
@entity13 said it was ' inflammatory and liable to damage race relations '			0
more than 40 years later , treasury minister @entity5 said that damage has still not been repaired			1

treasury minister says anti-immigration speeches four decades *ago* still tarnish conservative party
*son* of a @entity8 *bus* *driver* calls on @entity22 to give a major speech to repair damage
