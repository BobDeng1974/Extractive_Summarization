by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:40 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:16 est , 28 december 2013 it is a @entity4 collaboration between the @entity5 and @entity6 , which has provided heat to millions of homes across @entity5			1
but the little - known @entity9 - to - megawatts programme , which has seen 20,000 decommissioned @entity6 nuclear warheads transformed into nuclear energy in the @entity5 , has drawn to a close this month			1
the final shipment of low enriched uranium ( @entity16 ) was unloaded at the @entity17 in @entity18 on december 10 after a four - week journey by sea from @entity21			1
the recycling and transfer of the uranium to the @entity5 was formalised in a 1993 agreement and has seen hundreds of shipments arrive in the @entity5 destined for the country 's nuclear reactors			2
the programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all @entity5 electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs powered via the scheme in the last two decades			1
the shipment marks the end of the unprecedented programme , which has seen the @entity5 pay its former enemy $ 8billion ( Â £ 5bn ) in the last 20 years			1
the programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all @entity5 electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs have been powered via the scheme in the last two decades the shipments are transported from @entity21 to @entity5 by sea , before they are taken to the @entity53 plant to be converted into uranium pellets used to fuel nuclear reactors across @entity5 the four cylinders of @entity16 was taken from @entity57 to the @entity58 in @entity59 , where it will be turned into uranium oxide pellets destined for nuclear power plants across the country			1
towards the end of the @entity31 , @entity65 , a former deputy assistant secretary at the @entity5 @entity66 , was given the task of seeking ways to collaborate with past enemies			1
his quest saw him travel through the @entity6 countryside , to military facilities , many of which were not on the map			0
describing a typical scene , mr @entity65 said : ' @entity78 were broken , gates were not locked , and there were very few people around			0
' but it was inside the crumbling , dilapidated buildings that the @entity6 government stored the uranium from thousands of decommissioned nuclear weapons			1
concerned that the material could so easily fall into the wrong hands , mr @entity65 and his colleagues decided the situation was so dangerous that they needed to negotiate with the @entity6 to persuade them to sell the surplus to the @entity5			2
initially , the @entity6 refused			0
' it was a matter of pride , principle and patriotism , ' said mr @entity65			0
' even though they did n't need that excess material , [ and ] they did n't have the money to protect it , they did n't want to let go of it			0
' but the @entity6 nuclear industry needed funding and so the government yielded and a deal was struck in 1993			2
the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , is the @entity5 government agent responsible for implementing the historic agreement			0
before the uranium was shipped to the @entity5 , the bomb - grade highly enriched uranium was converted and diluted into low enriched uranium			2
' @entity9 made a substantial contribution both to the elimination of nuclear weapons material and to nuclear energy generation in the @entity5 , ' said @entity5 energy secretary @entity120			1
' nearly every commercial nuclear reactor in the @entity5 received nuclear fuel under the programme			2
' this agreement serves as an example of what the @entity5 and @entity6 can achieve when we work together , and we are carrying this success forward into other nonproliferation activities with each other and with our international partners			2
' for two decades , one in ten light bulbs in @entity5 has been powered by nuclear material from @entity6 nuclear warheads			1
' ' the 1993 @entity5 - @entity136 has proven to be one of the most successful nuclear nonproliferation partnerships ever undertaken , ' @entity135 added			2
' the completion of this " swords to ploughshares " program represents a major victory both for the @entity5 and @entity6			0
' @entity145 spokeswoman @entity144 , said in a statement : ' the @entity5 and @entity6 are commemorating the completion of one of the most successful non-proliferation programs in our history			0
' the @entity5 and @entity6 remain strongly committed to building on this success , and will continue to collaborate across various fields of nonproliferation , nuclear security and nuclear research and development			2
' the initiative has come to an end after @entity6 claimed the @entity5 was not paying enough for the uranium - which is roughly the equivalent value to 10 billion barrels of crude oil			1
while the @entity9 - to - megawatts programme has ended , @entity6 will continue to supply uranium to the @entity5			1
a new 10 - year programme is expected to supply around half the level of the previous scheme by 2015 , with the option to increase it to the same level as the @entity9 - to - megawatts programme if both sides agree			1
the difference is that , under the new contract , the supply will no longer come from decommissioned warheads , but from @entity6 's commercial activities			0
the programme came to an end this month as the last shipment reached the @entity5 the process began with the removal of the warheads and their highly enriched uranium metal components			1
at plants in @entity187 and @entity188 the components are ground down into metal shavings , which are then heated and converted into a highly enriched uranium oxide			0
that was then heated to make a gas , which was mixed with a very low enriched uranium material before it was diluted to less than five per cent concentration the fissionable uranium - 235 isotope , a level too low to be of any military value but ideal for producing electric power			0
the material is then transferred to 2.5 - tonne steel cylinders , enclosed in protective shipping containers and sent to a storage facility in @entity21			0
after completing its journey to @entity5 , the shipment is then taken to the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) plant in @entity53 , where it is tested to ensure it meets the appropriate specifications			0
it is then converted into uranium oxide pellets and fabricated into fuel assemblies			0
delivered to plants across the @entity5 to be used in their nuclear reactors to create energy .			0

in the last two decades 10 per cent of @entity5 electricity was fueled by the decommissioned @entity6 warheads
the @entity9 - to - megawatts programme was agreed in 1993 and has seen 500 tonnes of old warheads converted into electricity
around one in 10 light bulbs have been powered through the scheme in the last 20 years
last shipment reached the @entity17 from @entity21 this month
@entity5 energy secretary @entity120 said programme has been *instrumental* in the elimination of nuclear weapons left over from the @entity31
