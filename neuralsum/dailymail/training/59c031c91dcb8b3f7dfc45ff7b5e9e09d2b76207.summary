@entity0 will walk straight into a @entity2 headache if @entity3 finish sixth in the @entity4 on sunday			1
@entity3 will not cancel a lucrative pre-season tour of the @entity6 if they do qualify for @entity7 - leaving their new manager the task of picking two different @entity3 teams to play in different continents at the same time			1
the sixth - placed team will be required to enter the @entity2 at the third qualifying round stage and the first leg will have to be played on july 31 â€“ less than 48 hours after @entity3 are due to meet @entity19 in the @entity6 capital @entity53 it leaves @entity0 , whose appointment is expected to be confirmed in the next few days , the conundrum of picking one team for a prestigious @entity6 tour , and another good enough to ensure they can progress in the @entity2			1
to add to the complication , @entity3 's players who get to the latter stages of the @entity62 which ends on july 13 will still be on holiday			1
@entity3 will play at least four games in @entity6 this summer in the @entity66 between july 23 and august 4			1
the second leg of the @entity2 tie would be on august 7			2
no player is likely to be asked to play in both competitions but it does raise the possibility of @entity0 jetting from @entity53 straight to wherever @entity3 's @entity74 game is			1

' it is a consideration with my team selection as i want to be in @entity7			0
i think @entity3 should be in @entity7			2
obviously everyone wants to be in the @entity86 but with the squad we have got it would be good if we were in @entity7 , ' said @entity76			0
' i do n't think @entity90 ( who have not been in @entity7 this season ) have the size of squad that we 've got			0
i know from the last few weeks the selection problems you do have and that the manager will have next season if there is only one game a week			0
' it could be beneficial if we were in the competition			0
it could bring on players or give people games where they need it			0
' i played in @entity7 at 17 and 18 and it helped me as it was a different experience			0
it definitely brings you along quicker			0

the top - placed team will meet the winners of the other group featuring @entity90 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
the @entity6 hosts will expect @entity3 's big guns to go on tour leaving @entity0 to pick a shadow side for @entity7			1
