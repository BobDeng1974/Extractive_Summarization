trees grown as a biofuel have been seen as a greener , cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but could be having a detrimental effect on air quality			2
according to a new report they release a chemical into the air that , when mixed with other pollutants , can damage human health and reduce crop yields			2
the red hotspots show where deaths are expected to rise the most as a result of trees planted as biofuel crops			1
‘ growing biofuels is thought to be a good thing because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , ’ said @entity27 , who worked on the study with colleagues from at @entity30			1
‘ what we 're saying is “ yes , that 's great , but biofuels could also have a detrimental effect on air quality			2
‘ large - scale production of biofuels in @entity6 would have small but significant effects on human mortality and crop yields			1
‘ as far as we know , no one has looked at the air quality of growing biofuel crops before			2
’ the report , published in the journal @entity53 , looked into the impact of a @entity56 scheme to slow climate change by producing more biofuels			2
a similar impact would be expected wherever biofuels were produced in large quantities in areas suffering air pollution , including the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity67 , willow or eucalyptus trees , all used as fast - growing sources of renewable wood fuel , emit high levels of the chemical isoprene as they grow , the study said			1
@entity75 forms toxic ozone when mixed with other air pollutants in sunlight			1
the report estimated that ozone from wood - based energy to meet the @entity56 's 2020 goal would cause nearly 1,400 premature deaths a year , costing society £ 4.4 billion ( $ 7.1bn )			1
the @entity6 plan would also reduce the annual value of wheat and maize production by £ 900 million ( $ 1.5bn ) since ozone impairs crop growth , the study added			1
changes in monthly mean ozone levels in july caused by trees grown for biofuel			1
@entity96 shows the highest rises			0
air pollution from extra isoprene is likely to reduce wheat and maize crops			1
@entity96 indicates the worst hit areas			0
other scientists said the findings showed that the impact of biofuels on human health needs to be taken into consideration when planning crops			2
but they said it is one of many factors and that the advantages of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels should not be ignored			2
dr @entity115 , scientific director of the @entity116 , @entity117 , did not see the study ’s findings being a reason to reverse the @entity122 ’s biofuels policies			0
‘ it is well known that many trees emit isoprene and efforts have been placed on reducing this , ’ she said			1
‘ we have flagged this up as a target for research , pointing out that reducing isoprene emissions from willow would not only reduce greenhouse gases but reduce loss of carbon from the plant			1
‘ having said that , at least one previous publication i know of does not suggest that the levels harm air quality			0
‘ for all these reasons we do not see that the @entity122 needs to reconsider its interest in biofuels			0
’ wheat is one of the crops likely to suffer a fall in yield			0
prof @entity150 , of the @entity151 , added : ‘ there are many different biofuel crops , cultivation methods , production and processing systems post-harvest , and different final biofuels			1
‘ each one has advantages and disadvantages , which must be compared to the advantages and disadvantages of alternative options			0
‘ the key is to ensure that the policies driving biofuel development and adoption are properly formulated to take account of these complexities			0
’ siting new biofuel plantations far away from polluted population centres would help limit ozone formation , the study suggested			0
genetic engineering might be used to reduce isoprene emissions , it said			1
@entity177 can cause lung problems and is blamed for killing about 22,000 people a year in @entity6			0
overall air pollution , mainly from fossil fuels , causes about 500,000 premature deaths in @entity6 a year , according to the @entity183			0
he noted that the main reason to shift to biofuels was to cut emissions of carbon dioxide , mainly from fossil fuels , that @entity191 studies project will become ever more damaging this century			1
the @entity191 ' @entity192 estimates global warming has caused more than 140,000 deaths annually worldwide since the 1970s			0
the biggest impact was recorded in developing nations where floods , droughts and other disasters blamed on climate change left millions of people suffering from diarrhoea , malnutrition , malaria and dengue fever			0
burning biofuels is viewed as neutral for climate change because plants soak up carbon when they grow and release it when they burn or rot			0
fossil fuels , by contrast , add carbon to the atmosphere from underground stores millions of years old .			0

@entity75 released by trees can produce oxone in the atmosphere
fast - growing trees ideal as biofuels produce high levels of isoprene
emissions expected to reduce wheat and maize production by £ *900,000*
