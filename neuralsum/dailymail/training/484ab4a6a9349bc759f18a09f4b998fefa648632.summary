@entity0 has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			1
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity6 and @entity7 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity0 research benefits humanity			1
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			1
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity6 and @entity7 ( pictured ) , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity0 research benefits humanity			1
the document , drafted by the @entity19 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity0 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			1
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			1
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity0 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			2
@entity6 previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines , to ' summoning the demon ' but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity0 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity0 may put millions of people out of work			1
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			1
' our ai systems must do what we want them to do , ' the letter says			0
' many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of @entity0 while mitigating adverse effects , which could include increased inequality and unemployment			1
' other signatories to the @entity19 's letter include @entity84 , executive director of @entity85 and @entity86 , professor of physics at the @entity88 and a @entity90 laureate			2
the letter comes just weeks after professor @entity7 warned that @entity0 could someday overtake humans			1
@entity93 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			0
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity99 , a @entity101 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			0
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number one risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity114 's @entity113 said in a recent interview			0
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity0 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			2
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity128 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
neuroscientist @entity130 , 37 , founded @entity114 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
speaking at event in @entity136 , the physicist told the @entity137 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity0 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			2
' in november , @entity6 , the entrepreneur behind @entity149 and @entity150 , warned that the risk of ' something seriously dangerous happening ' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years			2
he has previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines , to ' summoning the demon '			1
speaking at the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) @entity159 in october , @entity6 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			2
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			0
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			0
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			0
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			0
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and â€¦ he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' the letter issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity0 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1

letter says there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity0 is making good progress
areas benefiting from @entity0 research include driverless cars and robot motion
but in the short term , it warns @entity0 may put millions of people out of work
in the long term , robots could become far more intelligent than humans
@entity6 has previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines to ' summoning the demon '
