by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:09 pm on 16th august 2011 it was supposed to be the fightback tour across the @entity5 heartland to re-engage with @entity5 voters			0
but president @entity7 appeared flustered and uncomfortable as he was confronted by angry @entity9 activists as he kicked off his make - or - break bus tour last night			1
a beleaguered mr @entity7 is trying to counter a massive in drop in popularity as a @entity14 poll shows his approval rating has slumped to a record low of below 40 per cent			1
@entity18 called for more civility from the administration , saying : ' your vice president is calling people like me , a @entity9 member , a “ terrorist ”			1
’ mr @entity18 was referring to media reports that vice president @entity25 had made the remark at a private meeting on debt with @entity41 @entity40 earlier this month			2
as mr @entity18 and another activist further questioned the president after the meeting , he stammered his answers while trying to continue to shake the hands of more supportive people at the event			2
during the meeting , mr @entity7 had responded : ‘ i absolutely agree that everybody needs to try to tone down the rhetoric			2
more welcoming : president @entity7 shakes hands as he today greets people outside his hotel in @entity55 , @entity21 tour : mr @entity7 gets a high - five from a young boy this morning in need of a hug ? @entity7 today embraces a woman who said it was her birthday an specially built armoured bus has been bought to be used by the president to use during the 2012 election campaign			1
the bus costing at least $ 1.1 million is being used by mr @entity7 as he travels across the @entity66			1
the @entity67 has paid $ 2.2 million for two buses that will be used by the president and @entity71 candidates , but the cost is likely to be much higher because of extra security features added after manufacture			1
@entity67 spokesman @entity75 said : ' we 've been overdue for having this asset in our protective fleet for some time			2
' we 've been protecting presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates all the way back to the 1980s using buses during bus tours			0
' ' they 're certainly going to be used for bus tours around the country , ' as well as other events , he added			0
' when protectees go to remote areas , go camping or on a motorcycle trip , we 'll bring the asset out as a mobile security facility , ' he told @entity95			0
' in fairness , since i have been called a socialist who was n’t born in this country , who is destroying @entity5 and taking away its freedoms because i passed a health care bill , i am all for lowering the rhetoric			0
’ today , on the second day of the three - day bus tour , mr @entity7 is spending time promoting rural economic policies , among the series of remedies he is pushing to fire up job growth			1
the president began with an early morning workout at a @entity55 gym and later chatted with a few locals outside his hotel before getting on the bus to his next event , a @entity117 at @entity118 in @entity119			2
as the tour kicked off , @entity71 presidential hopeful @entity120 attacked @entity7 , calling the trip around @entity66 states a ' @entity124 '			2
the comment , which refers to the @entity127 iconic 1967 album ' @entity128 ' , is a continuation of the @entity71 frontrunner 's unrelenting attack on @entity7 - a strategy he has pursued at the expense of criticising his @entity71 rivals			1
a statement released by the @entity120 camp said : ' during his @entity124 bus tour this week , it is unlikely president @entity7 will speak with unemployed @entity5 , to near - bankrupt business owners , or to families struggling to survive in this economy			1
' he is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class			0
' turning this economy around will require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually worked in the private sector			0
' the @entity5 president will make five stops on the three - state trip to @entity21 , @entity153 and @entity154 - in the first bus tour since he famously criss - crossed the country in 2008 seeking the presidency			2
convoy : the president 's motorcade , which includes a new $ 1.1m coach is passing through the @entity66 slump : president @entity7 's job approval rating dropped to 40 per cent during the week spanning august 8 - 14 feeling the heat : president @entity7 wipes his brow as he takes questions on his bus tour the elaborate $ 1.1 million battle - bus - nicknamed @entity168 one - is the first of its kind to be bought by the @entity67			1
it comes after a summer spent fighting politicians in @entity173 over the nation 's debt crisis - and a day after two ' fast - rising ' republicans were mobbed at a fundraiser in @entity21 - where @entity7 will make his first stop			1
@entity7 will have the chance to absorb the public 's anger and do his best to give optimistic answers as he travels between town hall stops			1
and with unemployment standing above nine per cent , the country feeling the deep pinch of a stunted recovery and suffering the humiliation of a major debt agency lowering its credit rating , it seems he will have a lot to talk about			0
his aides have revealed he is unlikely to engage any of his potential @entity71 rivals by name			0
but , with his poll rating falling , he intends to draw sharp contrasts between his ideas on the economy and the @entity71 approach			0
he has dismissed that as little more than slashing spending on vital programs like education and @entity203 , the programme that provides health care for the poor			0
sources also said that he was ready to hear complaints from disaffected @entity40 tired of his compromises with @entity71 , and from a public disgusted with a dysfunctional @entity173			0
tour : the make - or - break tour comes as poll numbers indicated the president had slumped to an all - time - low of just 39 per cent talks : @entity7 meets six - year - old @entity215 outside the @entity217 cafe in @entity218 , @entity154 talks : @entity7 had lunch with five post- 9/11 @entity154 veterans at the @entity222 in @entity223 @entity224 around : @entity7 was pictured clutching a pie and mimicking telephone calls during his tour the tour itinerary takes @entity7 through three states he won in 2008 , but where he now needs to shore up his standing			1
in @entity21 , he returns to a state that handed him a key victory over @entity40 rival @entity233 in 2008			0
but it is now where @entity71 have been blanketing the state in preparation for its first - in - the - nation caucuses			0
the first signal that their plan could be bearing fruition came last night when the two fastest - rising stars in the race for the 2012 @entity71 presidential nomination were mobbed by adoring republicans as they attended a fundraiser in the state			0
@entity248 , fresh off her win in a closely watched test vote in the long road to choosing @entity7 's opponent , portrayed herself as a mainstream midwesterner			1
the audience is rapt at the president delivers a speech at @entity258 's @entity257 in @entity223 , @entity154 on monday audience : @entity7 speaks during a town hall meeting , monday , aug. 15 , 2011 , at the @entity261 in @entity55 , @entity21 playtime : children from public schools in the town of @entity266 , @entity154 , help @entity7 get up after he sat down with them for a picture front runner : leading @entity71 presidential candidate @entity120 speaks during a campaign stop today newcomer @entity270 introduced himself as a common - sense executive focused on jobs			1
both candidates attended the same county dinner in northern @entity21 one day after the race was upended by @entity248 's victory in the @entity21 straw poll and @entity270 's announcement of his candidacy			0
and while both candidates have strong ties to the influential evangelical wing of the party and are popular with upstart tea party supporters , they told activists at the @entity289 @entity71 's @entity288 dinner in @entity290 that they have credibility on the party 's leading priority , @entity280 made a similar outing last year , travelling the @entity66 in a two - day , three - state tour in april 2010 that took him to @entity21 , @entity153 and @entity297			2
there was no bus , but the president 's motorcade made hours - long drives through rural areas , passing school children waving @entity5 flags and seniors sitting on lawn chairs			1
the trip gave him a chance to engage in some of the grass roots politicking he perfected in 2008 during weeks spent campaigning in the small towns that would help carry him to victory in places like @entity21			0

president polls just 39 per cent - an all time low
