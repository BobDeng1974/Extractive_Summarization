by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 2 april 2013 a second toll motorway is planned as part of a road building drive to power @entity5 ’s faltering economic recovery – but it will take 18 years to complete			1
ministers are planning to revive a decades - old plan to ease congestion on part of the @entity10 in @entity11 , which is expected to be announced in june			1
@entity12 has agreed to underwrite the £ 1billion project , @entity15 sources claimed , which will be part of a major programme of upgrades to other major roads			0
a new relief road in @entity20 could became the second toll motorway in @entity5 similar to the current section of the @entity23 , pictured transport officials are understood to be considering several other possible projects including an upgrade to the @entity27 of @entity28 which would link @entity29 and @entity30 by dual carriageway for the first time ; the @entity33 in southwest @entity34 , and the @entity35 running through the @entity36			1
the @entity10 scheme was first considered in 1989 and plans were unveiled almost ten years ago , but shelved five years later due to spiralling costs			0
it is now expected to be the centrepiece of an infrastructure package , after the chancellor announced an extra £ 3.3billion a year in funding for major projects to boost jobs and growth			1
but it will take three years of preparation and 15 years to build and is not expected to open until the year 2031 , highlighting the problems the government faces with getting major works underway			0
@entity12 announced £ 3billion extra a year in infrastructure spending in last month 's budget @entity55 claimed the controversial high speed 2 railway line – opposed by many of his backbenchers - was ‘ vital ’ if @entity5 was to compete in the ‘ global race ’			0
but the first fast trains to @entity61 will not run until 2026 and the second phase to @entity63 and @entity64 will not be ready until the mid- 2030s			0
the anticipated announcement in this summer ’s @entity66 follows a government row about whether to embark on major and costly infrastructure investment to take advantage of low interest rates , to create jobs and improve the local economy			1
the @entity10 project , 14 - miles stretch of dual carriageway as a relief road between junctions 23 and 29 , is intended to end notorious bottlenecks at the @entity79 on the outskirts of @entity81			2
it has a budget of £ 830million over 15 years , and a toll will be operated by the @entity15 to pay it back			2
it is not without controversy as while ministers claim it will boost the @entity11 economy as the roads are predicted to become more congested , campaigners warn it could backfire			1
@entity95 president @entity94 said introducing tolls could deter motorists , which he said had been a problem on the @entity5 ’s first tolled motorway , the 27 - mile @entity101 near @entity61			1
he said : ‘ we have seen with the @entity101 that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges			2
' there is already a toll to get into @entity20 on the @entity108 but no toll to get out			2
there is no doubt that the @entity10 around @entity81 needs improving			0
at the moment if there is a bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for drivers			1
‘ but if the road is tolled it reduced its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it and will simply avoid it			0
’ the @entity33 is controversial due to environmental objections as it would run through scenic countryside and it has been claimed it could disturb archaeological remains at @entity128			0
but the @entity35 in @entity129 , an accident blackspot where dozens of motorists have died , would be welcomed .			0

chancellor ' set to announce new toll road along the @entity135 in @entity11 '
@entity95 claims road would not boost economy as drivers would shun the cost
