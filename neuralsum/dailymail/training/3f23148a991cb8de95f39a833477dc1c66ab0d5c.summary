by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:32 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 18:23 est , 20 june 2012 a @entity3 congressional panel voted on wednesday to hold attorney general @entity4 in contempt of @entity6 for his failure to turn in sensitive @entity9 documents after a grueling six hours deliberating on @entity10			1
after the 23 - 17 party - line vote , the controversy will now be passed onto the full @entity13 , which will vote on it next week , unless there is a resolution in the interim			1
in the case , the @entity19 administration invoked executive privilege for the first time since coming to office , withholding some documents related to a failed gun - running investigation			1
decision made : after six hours of arguments and amendments , members on the @entity29 side of the @entity30 consider a vote to hold attorney general @entity4 in contempt of @entity6 announcement : @entity35 representative @entity35 , centre , delivers remarks to reporters after the committee approved a resolution holding attorney general holder in contempt of @entity6 attorney general @entity4 talks to reporters after meeting with @entity30 chairman @entity43 the @entity29 - controlled @entity13 ' @entity30 , on a party - line vote , decided to cite the nation 's top law enforcement officer in connection with the operation , code - named ' @entity49			1
' the move set up a new confrontation between the @entity53 president and @entity6			0
house speaker @entity54 and majority leader @entity55 said if the requested documents were submitted before that vote , it would provide an opportunity to resolve the issue			0
in theory , an official charged with contempt could be punished with a fine or jail , but no one expects it to come to that			0
weeks or months of controversy feeding into the presidential election campaign is the more likely result			0
@entity29 were already taking advantage of the moment to portray the president as a participant in a cover - up , just as congressional @entity53 did when they fought with president @entity77 over that administration 's refusal to turn over documents relating to the dismissal of a group of federal prosecutors			2
' until now , everyone believed that the decisions regarding ' @entity49 were confined to the @entity9 , ' said @entity86 , a spokesman for @entity54			2
he added : ' the @entity88 decision to invoke executive privilege implies that @entity88 officials were either involved in the @entity49 operation or the cover - up that followed			1
' presidents since @entity94 have claimed executive privilege to protect internal documents and conversations in similar disputes with @entity6 with varying results , as the courts have never given presidents any absolute authority to defy subpoenas from @entity6			1
even before the vote , the @entity88 criticized the panel chaired by conservative representative @entity43			0
president @entity19 has granted an 11th - hour request by attorney general @entity4 to exert executive privilege over the @entity107 documents the @entity9 has said ' instead of creating jobs or strengthening the middle - class , congressional @entity29 are spending their time on a politically - motivated , taxpayer - funded election - year fishing expedition , ' @entity88 communications director @entity108 told @entity113			1
@entity114 and other @entity29 on the panel accused the @entity9 that @entity4 heads of stonewalling and trying to protect its political appointees from potentially embarrassing revelations about the botched gun - running probe			2
' the frustration of this committee in not getting documents for a year and a half must be satisfied today , ' @entity114 said			0
the documents , requested by a @entity13 committee , explain how the @entity9 learned that there were problems with the operation that resulted in hundreds of guns illicitly purchased in @entity132 gun shops winding up in @entity133			2
in february 2011 , when the controversy over the law enforcement operation was first disclosed , the department denied that agents had engaged in gun - walking			0
' it ’s a whole variety of material , and it ’s consistent with what we have already made available — emails , documents of that nature — that really go into the way in which the department handled itself from february of 2011 until december of 2011 , ' @entity4 told reporters			2
the @entity149 says that president @entity19 has exerted executive privilege over @entity49 documents after attorney general @entity4 made the personal request ordinarily , such deliberative documents are off - limits to @entity6			1
in @entity49 , the @entity9 ’s initial incorrect denials are seen as providing justification for @entity6 ’ document demands			2
@entity43 and the @entity13 @entity29 leadership have asked whether the department ’s initial denial in a feb. 4 , 2011 , letter to sen. @entity162 , @entity163 , was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation			0
the material ' pretty clearly demonstrates that there was no intention to mislead , to deceive , ' @entity4 told reporters			0
' the attorney general has made an unprecedented offer to turn over documents that are part of the @entity9 ’s internal deliberations and work product and to brief the committee on their contents , ' said rep. @entity179 of @entity180 , one of the committee ’s @entity53 and a former federal prosecutor			1
' regrettably , chairman @entity43 refuses to take yes for an answer			0
' ' we have offered to make materials available ... to brief on those documents , to answer any questions that might come up with regard to the documents that we produced , ' the attorney general said			1
' the ball ’s in their court , ' @entity4 said			0
' we made what we thought was an extraordinary offer			0
' @entity43 took a different view : ' after this meeting i can not say that i am optimistic ' for avoiding a contempt vote			0
attorney general @entity4 ( right ) walks through @entity204 to speak to reporters following his meeting on @entity10 in @entity207 on tuesday @entity43 spokesman @entity208 said that at the meeting , ' the attorney general indicated he would only be willing to produce a subset of documents that numbered fewer than 1,300 pages if the committee would first agree that the production of these documents would end the committee ’s investigation of the @entity9			1
' @entity43 declined the offer			0
in a letter to @entity43 on tuesday night , deputy attorney general @entity218 said ' our offer would have provided the committee with unprecedented access to these documents , many of which are not covered by the committee ’s subpoenas in this matter			1
' the @entity88 move came in response to a planned vote by the @entity30 to hold attorney general @entity4 in contempt of @entity6 for withholding the documents			1
the panel 's chairman , @entity29 @entity43 , vowed to press on with the contempt charge			0
' i write now to inform you that the president has asserted executive privilege over relevant ... documents , ' deputy attorney general @entity218 wrote to the committee			1
executive privilege allows the @entity88 to argue that some private communications between the president and members of his administration can not be divulged to @entity6			1
' this untimely assertion by the @entity9 falls short of any reason to delay today 's proceedings , ' @entity43 said			0
if the @entity13 panel votes to charge @entity4 with contempt , it would then be up to the @entity254 to decide whether to bring that charge against the nation 's top law enforcement officer			1
the process could take months or even years of court battles and further poison the political atmosphere in a presidential election year			0
for months , the committee and the @entity9 have been in negotiations over documents related to federal law enforcement 's handling of the ' @entity49 ' probe of guns heading from the @entity3 into @entity133 and then being used by @entity133 drug cartels			2
president @entity19 asserted executive privilege for the first time wednesday			1
he applied the presidential power to withhold documents a @entity13 committee is seeking in an investigation of a flawed gun - smuggling probe called @entity49			2
presidents have the right to invoke executive privilege to preserve the confidentiality of information and documents in the face of legislative inquiries			2
the @entity88 says presidents have asserted that privilege 25 times since 1980			0
here 's a look at how many times each president since @entity290 have asserted executive privilege : president @entity19 : 1 president @entity77 : 6 president @entity291 : 14 president @entity292 : 1 president @entity290 : 3			1

@entity294 found attorney general @entity4 in contempt for ' @entity49 ' documents
controversy will go to full @entity13 next week unless resolution reached
