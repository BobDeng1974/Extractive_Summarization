the family of a two - year - old diagnosed with a rare brain tumour say they have been forced to beg for their daughter 's life – after she was refused @entity7 funding for treatment			1
@entity9 and his wife @entity10 say the @entity7 is denying their daughter a ' chance at life ' by refusing to fund proton beam therapy			1
the desperate couple say the pioneering treatment is the best chance that their daughter @entity18 has at beating her rare but deadly , primitive neuroectodermal tumour ( @entity21 )			2
they now need to raise £ 250,000 to fund the treatment – which is only available abroad - as they believe it is less invasive than radiotherapy , which can have devastating side effects			1
the family of two - year - old @entity29 , who has been diagnosed with a rare brain tumour , say they have lost their dignity in begging for their daughter 's life mr and mrs @entity29 want to take @entity18 to the @entity36 for proton beam therapy , but have been turned down for funding from the @entity7			1
mrs @entity29 said : ' the @entity7 have n't given her a chance of life			1
it 's absolutely disgusting ' @entity43 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			2
it is not available in the @entity49 , but the @entity7 sometimes offers funding for some patients to go abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy			1
mr and mrs @entity29 - who have both work for the @entity7 - fear they may have to follow in the footsteps of the parents of @entity57 who rejected @entity7 advice and took their own children abroad for the treatment when the @entity7 refused to fund it			2
mrs @entity29 said : ' the @entity7 have n't given her a chance of life			1
' it 's absolutely disgusting			0
we 've both worked for the @entity7 for a long time , but now we want something back , but they ca n't help us			0
' they have made us lose our dignity and beg for our daughter 's life			0
' @entity18 was diagnosed with the tumour in may last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy - coming back from death more than once			1
mr and mrs @entity29 , who live in @entity75 , @entity76 , want to take her for specialist proton beam therapy in @entity36 to save her life			1
the family has already raised £ 80,000 to pay for accommodation across the pond , after receiving support from the @entity7 rugby team and @entity85 star and cancer survivor @entity84			1
they applied to the @entity88 but were turned down			0
now they need to raise a further £ 170,000 to cover the cost of the treatment - and they face a race against time as the tumour could grow at any moment			2
@entity18 was diagnosed with the tumour in may last year and has since fought through numerous operations and sessions of chemotherapy			1
the family need to raise £ 250,000 for the proton beam therapy treatment , and have so far raised £ 80,000 if they ca n't raise enough money for treatment , @entity18 will have to have radiotherapy — which has a high chance of leaving her unable to live an independent life			1
mr @entity9 highlighted the case of @entity57 's family , and said : ' ninety per cent of me wishes we had done what they did			0
' @entity57 's family removed him from @entity113 , taking him to @entity114 last year , for the pioneering treatment , which was later paid for by the @entity7			2
the family had raised similar concerns about radiotherapy			0
a @entity120 spokeswoman said proton beam therapy is only commissioned on a very limited basis , and clinical guidelines define which cancers the therapy is an effective treatment for			1
@entity127 are set to wear special wristbands to raise awareness of @entity18 's plight when they take on @entity132 tomorrow			2

@entity43 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			2
the radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy x-rays , used in conventional radiotherapy			0
unlike an x-ray , the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body			0
it enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely			0
@entity43 beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision			0
it is not available on the @entity7 , but sometimes the health service funds patients going abroad for the treatment the beam can be more finely controlled , in both its width and its depth , so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours , with less risk to healthy tissues			0
the therapy is not available in the @entity49 , though the @entity7 will fund sending patients abroad if their care team thinks they are ideally suited to receive proton beam therapy			1
around 400 patients – mostly children – have been abroad since 2008			0
the @entity7 choices website says : ‘ some overseas clinics providing proton beam therapy heavily market their services to parents who are understandably desperate to get treatment for their children			1
‘ @entity43 beam therapy can be very costly and it is not clear whether all children treated privately abroad are treated appropriately			0
‘ it is important not to lose sight of the fact that conventional radiotherapy is , in most cases , both safe and effective with a low risk of complications			0
