by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 faced a barrage of criticism last week after going ahead with a surfing holiday as @entity6 descended into turmoil			1
but it seems the @entity10 's murderous rampage across the @entity11 is still not enough to tempt him back to @entity13			2
for just four days later , he 's back on the board despite @entity17 ' calls for an emergency recall as the news is dominated by fears of radicalised @entity21			2
@entity35 human rights chief @entity34 today called on the international community to treat as a priority the ' appalling , widespread ' crimes being committed by @entity10 forces in @entity6 , including killings , slavery , sexual crimes and targeting people on ethnic or religious grounds			1
however , the prime minister was seen enjoying the bank holiday monday alongside hundreds of other surfers in @entity48			0
polls last week revealed more than 80 per cent of @entity21 voters do not believe that @entity2 can handle the @entity6 crisis from his holiday beach			1
he made a flying 19 - hour return visit to @entity54 following @entity30 's murder before going back to the south west			1
unfazed : he has admitted there is poor phone signal at the beach but he went out surfing again anyway like water off a duck 's back : the @entity35 has called on the international community to act to stop the @entity10 after the murder of @entity30 , but @entity2 will work from the beach mr @entity2 said : ‘ wherever i am in the world i am always within a few feet of a @entity67			1
’ but , he admitted , his phone reception in @entity48 is very poor			2
on friday , an onlooker said : ' he seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself			0
' he did n't do any real surfing - the conditions were n't really there for it - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times			0
@entity77 mp @entity76 , the former @entity21 human rights envoy to @entity6 , was equally furious about mr @entity2 's decision to return to his holiday in @entity21			1
she said : ‘ i just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in @entity82 – it is just not good enough			2
taking advantage of the august gloom : the prime minister was one of hundreds of surfers out in the waves today for @entity90 monday as a chilly wind swept over south west @entity92 packed : it was raining with grey skies but @entity96 surfers were undeterred as they hit the waves in their droves ' if he is serious about the threat to @entity21 , as he says he is and as he ought to be , then he should not be pushing off on holiday			0
' he should be recalling mps to @entity103 so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response			0
' up to 670 prisoners from @entity110 prison in the city of @entity112 were killed by @entity10 on june 10 after being taken by truck to a vacant area and screened for @entity115 , she said , quoting survivors and witnesses to the ' massacre ' as telling @entity35 human rights investigators			0
preparation : these holidaymakers enjoyed the long weekend by preparing for a surfing session it marked a gloomy end to the final holiday of the summer in 2014 with rain forecast for the coming week ' such cold - blooded , systematic and intentional killings of civilians , after singling them out for their religious affiliation , may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity , ' @entity34 said			0
the @entity135 splinter group seized control of the @entity6 city of @entity112 on june 10 , putting security forces to flight in a show of strength against the @entity144 - led @entity143 government			0
@entity34 , a former @entity35 war crimes judge , called on the @entity6 government and international community to protect vulnerable ethnic and religious communities , including at least 13,000 @entity148 in @entity149 besieged by @entity151 forces since mid-june amid ' fear of a possible imminent massacre ' .			1
