by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 14:28 est , 20 november 2012 these staggering pictures of a beautiful rare white deer might seem like something straight out of a @entity5 adventure			1
but they were in fact taken by a @entity9 family in @entity10 , @entity11 as they literally came face to face with the stuff of legends			1
the shots of the white stag were captured by @entity19 and @entity20 who were stunned to come across the mythical creature - said by many to be a lucky charm - as they took their four - year - old daughter @entity24 to her dance school			1
beautiful : @entity27 and her family spotted this rare white deer near @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity30 rare : far from being afraid of the @entity33 fmily , the white stag led them long the pathway towards four - year - old @entity24 's dance school the family were driving through the @entity39 forest when they spotted the unusual stag and slammed on the brakes			1
but the ghost - like deer was not fussed with the stunned family and stared them down before running off back into the forest			1
@entity19 , 30 , said she had never seen or heard about white deer before and took a snap of the animal			1
the family now hope that spotting the creature will bring them a slice of luck before @entity55			1
she said : ' usually deer disappear into the trees , but this one did n’t , and just kept walking up the road in front of us			1
' it led us a considerable distance right up the road until we got to a cattle grid then it jumped into the woods			0
' we went over the grid and parked in the @entity71 car park and there it was again right in front of us , staring straight at us			0
graceful : the beautiful creature eventually disappeared silently into the bushes ' i took its picture then it just silently disappeared into the woods again			1
' after the discovery on saturday , @entity19 went home , ironically to @entity81 in @entity82 , and looked up white deer on the internet			1
@entity19 found that many people believe a white stag is a lucky omen and they also hold a place in the mythology of many cultures			1
legend has it on the island of @entity94 that if a white stag in seen then a member of the ruling family , the @entity95 , has died			2
@entity19 added : ' it ’s a bit weird when you think about it , us in @entity81 , then this unusual stag			1
' the whole thing sounds like a good omen to me			0
@entity55 is coming up , and a lottery win would be nice			1
' @entity24 who was being taken to her class could n’t believe her eyes and ran to her shocked teacher claiming : ' a white deer led us up the road			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity116 said it was unlikely the deer was an albino and was more likely to have a rare condition called leucism			2
she said : ' white deer are rare			2
they can either be albinos or they can have a rare genetic pattern called leucism which causes a reduction in the pigment of their hair and skin			0
' white deer are often confused with albino deer but the albino is distinctive because of its characteristic red eyes			2
unlike an albino , leucism causes a reduction in pigmentation and not just melanin			0
there are several well known references to the white deer in mythology , legend and literature : according to the @entity9 legend , in 1128 , @entity147 , @entity148 of @entity9 decided to go hunting on the @entity150 of the @entity151 , against the wishes of his priest			2
while hunting he saw a huge white stag , or " hart " , and while giving chase he was thrown from his horse			0
the white hart charged forward to kill him , so @entity147 - son of @entity160 and @entity161 - called on @entity162 to save him			2
as the king grasped the hart 's antlers , they miraculously turned in to a large cross , and the beast raised its head and vanished			0
inspired by his vision , @entity147 built a shrine to the @entity151 - meaning @entity173 - on the spot where the miracle occurred			2
the ruin of @entity177 can still be seen today , at the foot of the @entity179 next to @entity180			0
the @entity181 in @entity183 's grassmarket , reputedly the oldest pub in the capital , took its name from the legend			0
the @entity187 considered white stags to be messengers from the " other world " and their appearance was said to herald some profound change in the lives of those who encountered them			0
in the @entity197 , the @entity196 is fabled to grant wishes to whoever catches him			0
and in the @entity203 legend , the white stag is the creature that can never be caught			0
@entity203 's repeatedly unsuccessful pursuit of the white stag represents mankind 's quest for spiritual knowledge			0
in @entity210 a white stag was said to be instrumental in the conversion of the martyr @entity212 after he saw a vision of the animal that told him he would suffer for @entity215 .			0

@entity19 and @entity20 came across the creature in @entity10 , @entity11 , while taking daughter @entity24 to a dance class
the family now hope that the *sighting* of the deer - a lucky charm according to many - will lead to a lottery win in time for @entity55
