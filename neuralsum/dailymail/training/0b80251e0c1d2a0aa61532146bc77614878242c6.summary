white working - class pupils need the same @entity3 language support as foreign classmates , a study suggests white working - class pupils should be given the same @entity3 language support as foreign classmates to stop them falling behind , according to a report			1
it found some working - class pupils can not even recognise their own name when they start school – and there is not enough money to help them			2
it comes a week after a government report found white working - class pupils had the worst exam results of any ethnic group			1
the study , in the @entity21 borough of @entity22 , found those children from ethnic minorities with @entity3 as a second language were articulate by the time they reached year six because of the level of support they had			0
they are also given a thorough induction to help with their @entity3 skills when they first arrive			0
white working - class pupils , on the other hand , who had language skills so bad they struggle to communicate with their peers had a severe lack of support			1
the report also found that social deprivation and the low aspirations of parents have fuelled low achievement among white , working - class pupils in @entity48			1
the paper , which is being presented at a conference at @entity52 ’s @entity51 today , concludes : ‘ members of staff felt school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working - class community			2
’ one co-ordinator told researchers that pupils who had @entity3 as an additional language could recognise the difference between ‘ bigger ’ and ‘ biggest ’ – but ‘ the white children did not have the vocabulary ’			0
the authors , dr @entity68 , of @entity69 , and dr @entity70 , from @entity71 , warn that the failure of government statistics to distinguish the white @entity75 ethnic group by social background has also masked the problem			0
the study , drawing on statistical analysis , evidence from parents , focus groups and schools , confirms that one of the biggest groups of underachievers is the white working class and their performance , at both @entity89 two and @entity89 four , are considerably below those of all other major ethnic groups at national level			0
the study in the @entity21 borough of @entity22 found children from ethnic minorities with @entity3 as a second language were articulate by the time they reached year six because of the level of support they had ( stock pic ) the national data shows that 32 per cent of white @entity75 pupils eligible for @entity106 ( @entity106 ) achieved 5 + @entity108 grades at @entity109 , compared with 65 per cent who are not eligible for @entity106			2
the gap is 33 % compared to smaller gaps for all other ethnic groups			0
the report also found that social deprivation and the low aspirations of parents have fuelled low achievement among white , working - class pupils in @entity48			1
it found that the low achievement of many white working - class pupils has been obscured by middle - class success in the @entity3 school system .			1

study found pupils with @entity3 as second language were articulate by year six
but white working - class pupils struggled to communicate with peers
study shows white working - class pupils are one of biggest underachievers
