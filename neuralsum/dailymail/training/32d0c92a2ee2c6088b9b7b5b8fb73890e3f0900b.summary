it was on october 1 , 1996 that a relatively unknown @entity1 called @entity2 was unveiled at @entity3 as the new manager of @entity5			1
his appointment was , it 's fair to say , greeted with a mixture of bemusement and incredulity			0
one newspaper ran the back page headline ' @entity13 ? ' but little did we know then that @entity2 's arrival would herald the start of one of the most glorious chapters in the club 's history			1
in the 18 years since , he has delivered three @entity23 titles , five @entity24 and reached a @entity26 final			1
to commemorate the anniversary , here 's our rundown - in no particular order - of the greatest players of the @entity2 era			1
@entity33 @entity33 scores against @entity34 at @entity3 in the @entity23 the @entity36 master was already at @entity3 when @entity2 arrived but the @entity1 transformed him into an influential forward			1
@entity33 contributed memorable goals - who can forget that hat - trick at @entity34 or the pirouette at @entity42 - and was excellent for a decade , scoring 120 goals in 423 matches			2
@entity45 @entity45 scores a penalty for @entity5 against @entity47 during his first spell at the club the @entity1 had played under @entity2 at @entity50 and they were reunited for £ 11m in august 1999			1
@entity45 quickly established himself as a world class forward and a club legend , scoring 92 goals and powering them to the @entity23 title in 2002 and 2004			2
he was also voted @entity56 in consecutive years			0
@entity57 @entity57 avoids the challenge of @entity60 's @entity59 during a @entity26 game @entity2 's enforcer through the glory years , @entity57 is undoubtedly one of the best midfielders of modern times and has won pretty much every trophy on offer			1
he was a man who never shirked a tackle and inspired @entity5 to victory in countless important games during his nine ever - present seasons			2
@entity72 @entity72 scores @entity5 's third goal against @entity74 in the @entity75 considering @entity72 joined as a 17 - year - old for just £ 500,000 , his return of 28 goals , the @entity23 and the @entity79 is n't at all bad			1
though his time at @entity3 was short - lived , and included a few little dramas , he was a prolific scorer at the time for the @entity82			0
@entity83 @entity1 midfielder @entity83 powers past two @entity86 defenders in the @entity26 another man who played under @entity2 at @entity50 , midfielder @entity83 arrived for £ 2.5m in june 1997			1
that proved a bargain as his consistent performances helped @entity5 win the @entity91 in 1998 and he formed a formidable partnership with @entity57			2
. @entity93 @entity93 avoids a challenge from @entity96 's @entity95 during a @entity23 game in 1999 the scarily fast @entity36 winger was a key member of the double - winning side and memorably scored the crucial goal at @entity101 that turned the tide in the title race			2
he contributed 40 goals in all for the @entity82 - not bad for a winger - and left innumerable full backs terrified at the thought of facing him			0
@entity109 @entity109 and @entity2 celebrate winning the @entity23 in 1998 @entity110 was already part of the furniture at @entity3 long before @entity2 arrived but the manager got five more seasons out of the 30 - year - old			1
he captained the team to @entity117 in 1998 and 2002 , sealing his legendary status at the club he represented with distinction in a career spanning three decades			0
@entity122 @entity122 beats @entity123 to the ball during a defeat against @entity74 another pillar in that formidable @entity5 back line , @entity122 was actually largely out of favour during the 1998 double season , playing only 18 times in the league			2
but he soon regained his place and was integral for a few more seasons , signing off with a title winners ' medal as part of the @entity138 team			0
@entity139 right back @entity139 was described by @entity2 as his greatest ever signing the versatile @entity141 was one of @entity2 's most under - rated but valuable signings , arriving for £ 7.2m in the summer of 2000			1
after taking a little time to find his place in the team , @entity139 became an indispensible part of both the 2002 double winners and the @entity138			0
@entity149 @entity149 was a stalwart for @entity2 's sides during the 1990s and early 2000s long - established as @entity5 's no 1 , @entity2 rightly saw no reason to remove @entity149 when he arrived at the club			1
the keeper continued to excel , and was vital in all the @entity82 ' triumphs during the early @entity2 era			0
he was capable of making seemingly impossible saves , notably the one to keep out @entity159 's header against @entity160 in the 2003 @entity79 semi-final			0
@entity162 @entity162 has recovered from a serious injury to become one of @entity5 's most important players it 's only right to include a member of the successful team @entity2 is currently trying to mould at @entity5 and @entity162 would certainly be the choice of many			1
the @entity169 has really kicked on over the last two seasons , scoring a lot of goals and turning in consistently influential displays			0
he was the club 's player of the season in 2013 - 2014 and capped it with the winning goal in the @entity79 final , ending the club 's embarrassing nine - year trophy drought			0
@entity180 @entity180 left @entity181 for @entity5 and then returned to @entity182 in 2011 one of @entity2 's biggest success stories , taking a rough diamond of a 16 - year - old from @entity181 and turning him into a dynamic midfielder and club captain			1
@entity180 had the @entity182 flair and the grit required to succeed in the @entity23 and @entity5 were sorry to see him return home in 2011			1
@entity191 @entity192 established himself as one of the best left backs in the world at @entity5 before leaving in 2006 the youth graduate who became the best left back in the world , @entity191 may have been more successful at @entity96 but he was made at @entity5			0
he won the @entity23 twice and the @entity79 three times , making 228 first - team appearances in all			0
his rampaging runs down the left side and crossing , not to mention his tireless defensive work , were vital during the @entity138 season			0
@entity206 @entity1 midfielder @entity206 holds of @entity208 's @entity207 during a @entity210 derby in 2006 @entity5 fought off competition from @entity212 and @entity213 to sign the elegant @entity1 attacker @entity206 and he was worth it			1
imperious during the 2001 - 2002 double season , he created more goals than anyone else in the league			0
his polished technique , passing and finishing skills were also very much in evidence during the invincible years			0
@entity222 the sight of @entity222 celebrating was a familiar one during his eight seasons at @entity5 one of the most prolific strikers of the @entity2 era , @entity225 scored 132 goals in 277 matches during his eight seasons at the club			1
arriving from @entity232 in 2004 for a mere £ 2.75m , the @entity36 wasted little time in showing his predatory instinct and was particularly impressive in the 2008 - 2009 ( 20 goals ) and 2011 - 2012 ( 37 ) seasons			0
@entity236 signed on a free transfer from @entity208 , @entity236 went onto become a legend at @entity5 his transfer from rivals @entity208 in 2001 certainly ruffled a few feathers but @entity236 dispelled all criticism by winning the @entity23 and @entity79 in his first season			2
a natural successor to the retiring @entity109 and @entity122 , @entity236 produced regular commanding performances at the heart of the @entity5 defence			2
@entity247 @entity247 scores for @entity5 against @entity248 in the @entity26 in 2004 his £ 3m fee back in 1998 was a @entity251 record but it proved a bargain for @entity2			2
@entity247 scored and created many important goals during the @entity91 season and filled many roles across the midfield and in attack			0
he made in excess of 300 appearances for the club , winning two league titles and three @entity24			2
@entity262 @entity262 is tackled by @entity263 of @entity264 during a pre-season friendly the ultimate ' unsung hero ' , @entity262 put in scores of pivotal performances for @entity2 's teams			1
he stunned @entity96 with a 30 - yard goal in the 2002 fa cup final and captained the side to a 5 - 1 win over @entity274 in the @entity275			0
he made 339 league appearances for the club between 1992 and 2004			0
