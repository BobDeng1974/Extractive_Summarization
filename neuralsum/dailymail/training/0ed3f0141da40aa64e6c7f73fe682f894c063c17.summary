by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 another year , another @entity3 season			1
the 2014 - 15 edition of the four - nation competition promises to be the ‘ most competitive , interesting and exciting ’ yet , according to former @entity9 , @entity6 and @entity7 prop @entity8			1
with the @entity15 beginning in @entity16 next september , potential @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 representatives will be keen to showcase their credentials for their clubs and provinces			2
exciting : @entity20 pundit @entity8 expects the @entity3 season to be ' most competitive ' ever favourites : @entity8 believes his former side @entity7 are favourites to win an unprecedented third - straight title prediction : @entity20 rugby pundit @entity8 expects an extremely competitive @entity3 season rivalries : derbies , like @entity30 - @entity29 , will take on even greater significance in this season says @entity8 @entity20 have acquired the rights for the @entity3 this season , and their rugby union analyst @entity8 is excited to see how the season will unfold - especially with the new @entity37 qualifying system			1
with the @entity41 being replaced with the @entity42 for the 2014 - 15 season , the best placed team from each country in the @entity40 will qualify outright for the competition , as will the three highest ranked teams not already qualified			2
the eighth and ninth placed sides will then compete in a four - team play - off with an @entity16 and @entity49 side for the remaining @entity37 spot			1
and speaking ahead of the new season @entity8 , capped 45 times by the country of his birth and three times by the @entity9 , said : ' it ’s going to be a long season going all the way through to the @entity15 but certainly there is more excitement going into the @entity3 than in previous season			1
i think it can be the most competitive , interesting and exciting ever			0
' it should get off to a cracking start with @entity30 - @entity7 as that ’s always a big one			1
a lot of the national players are n’t available but with the pressures of qualification for the @entity72 it will be quite interesting to see how much the frontline players are pushed out early on in the season in particular			0
' @entity75 ( @entity7 ) - the 25 - year - old fly - half or centre ' excelled in last season 's final and he can replace @entity79 as the focal point of the @entity7 side '			1
time to shine : @entity75 starred for @entity7 in last season 's @entity3 final and can improve this year too @entity84 ( @entity85 ) - the 34 - year - old @entity87 @entity15 - winning full - back will ' really help @entity85 out and allow them to continue to become real challengers '			1
pedigree : @entity87 @entity15 - winner @entity84 gives @entity85 some much - needed experience @entity91 ( @entity92 ) - the 23 - year - old former @entity94 fly - half will be a ' big player for @entity96 - he is young , ambitious and talented with @entity98 experience and he has the potential to be a truly outstanding player '			1
outstanding : @entity91 is a young and exciting back who can thrive at @entity92 this season new format : @entity104 prop @entity8 ( centre ) thinks @entity37 qualification will make the league more exciting former @entity109 prop @entity8 believes every single match now takes on a huge significance , with a solitary point potentially the difference between qualification for @entity116 's premier competition or not			1
' derbies in @entity14 and @entity13 are going to be huge now as it could be the difference between whether you get @entity37 qualification or not , ' he continued			0
' it ’s very important they do get those top spaces , from a financial point of view			0
the distance @entity29 are behind @entity30 on the pitch makes it a very tough season for them in particular			2
' all sides like @entity85 and the ( @entity131 ) @entity129 will be targeting that fifth position because then you will be pretty much guaranteed a @entity37 spot			0
' a lot goes down to the @entity12 regions			0
in the past i have felt they have been happy with mid-table respectability but it puts pressure on them and the @entity145 sides because you can not just sit on your hands anymore			0
' @entity92 , meanwhile , seem to have a new renewed ambition after the club versus country row was solved in @entity12 and i expect them to go well this year			0
there is n't much between the @entity12 sides with the @entity129 improving and the @entity155 weakening somewhat , so it will be fascinating to see			0
' big miss : @entity7 and @entity6 legend @entity79 has retired but @entity8 expects his old side to compete gone : @entity7 have also lost the experience of @entity160 but @entity8 thinks they have what it takes again strong : @entity163 have made great progress recently and @entity8 thinks they have the power to challenge again despite the retirement of @entity145 stalwarts @entity79 and @entity160 , @entity8 is still tipping his old side to claim an unprecedented third title in a row			1
he expects @entity7 's main challengers to come for @entity6 too , but thinks @entity30 and @entity96 could throw up a potential surprise			1
@entity8 said : ' i think @entity7 are looking very strong again			2
obviously the leadership of @entity176 and @entity160 will be missed but they have some big players like @entity179			0
they ’re still the favourites for me			0
' @entity163 will be up there , as will @entity181			2
@entity181 are difficult ones as there is a massive change going on behind the scenes			0
@entity30 as they showed last few season are a very , very consistent side			2
' from the @entity12 sides , i think @entity96 are looking good , particularly with the signing of @entity190			2
they have lacked consistency but they now have @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity190			0
this is the year they might start becoming a contender again			0
' challengers : @entity92 ( left ) have recruited well while @entity181 ( right ) are always there or thereabouts success : former @entity9 prop @entity8 expects the 2014 - 15 @entity3 season to be the best campaign yet @entity20 will offer more live rugby than ever before this season with over 360 games including action from the @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity42 and autumn internationals .			1
