a @entity4 man who had veins protruding from his chest was diagnosed with @entity27 's disease , a rare and poorly understood condition that causes swelling of the blood vessels when doctors at the @entity32 in @entity33 , examined him , they found varices - rough , dliated veins - of the chest and abdominal wall			1
varicose veins in the legs also fall under the umbrella term of varices			1
these had been caused by an obstruction of the superior vena cava ( @entity45 ) - a large vein that carries blood from the body straight to the heart			0
it lies in the middle of the chest , behind the breast bone			0
superior vena cava obstruction ( @entity55 ) occurs when something blocks the blood from flowing along the svc			0
the walls of the @entity45 are thin , meaning they easily become squashed			0
a ct scan of his chest also revealed a dilated inferior vena cava - the vein that carries blood from the lower body to the heart - and a heart condition which meant the heart is restricted from stretching and filling with blood properly			2
the man was eventually diagnosed with @entity27 's disease , a rare and poorly understood condition that causes inflammation ( swelling ) of the blood vessels			1
