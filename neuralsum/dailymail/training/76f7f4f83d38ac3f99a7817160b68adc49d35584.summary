@entity1 's @entity0 made the ideal start to his bid for a third @entity5 title of the season - and second in @entity6 - in the @entity7 on thursday			1
@entity0 , who won the @entity8 in april and the rain - shortened @entity9 masters three weeks ago , carded a flawless opening 65 at a damp @entity11 to finish seven under par , one shot ahead of compatriot @entity14 , @entity16 's @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17			1
starting from the 10th , @entity0 birdied his first four holes and picked up another shot at the par - three 17th to reach the turn in 31 , before recording further birdies at the second and ninth			1
@entity0 has made an impressive start to the @entity7 as he leads the way on day one ' i think this country likes me , ' joked the 24 - year - old			1
' for me , this golf course is pretty much the same as the one where i won in @entity31			0
' i like this type of golf course with water and the target golf			0
i enjoy being in @entity6 and i 'm going to try my best the next few days to do the same things i did in april			0
' @entity0 is a close friend of both @entity14 - whose flawless 66 was achieved despite cracking the face of his driver during the round - and @entity40 star @entity39 , who returned a two - under - par 70 and is helping inspire the new generation of @entity1 players			1
' no @entity1 player has won a major or something like that , but i think we have a good mix between the older generation and young generation , ' @entity0 added			1
' @entity39 played the @entity40 this year and i think it showed all the @entity1 players it 's possible to play a big event like that and be in position to be in the @entity40 in @entity1 in 2018			2
' for my part i 'm thinking only about that , to be in @entity1 in 2018 at @entity55 , it 's an amazing place			2
i think we will have , i hope , two or three players on the @entity40 in 2018			0
@entity59 finds himself two shots behind @entity0 after shaking off jet lag to card a respectable 67 @entity62 tees off during the first round at @entity64 in @entity65 ' we have a good generation			1
every year some @entity1 players win and new players come on the @entity5			2
' @entity59 , who won the @entity69 at @entity55 earlier this season , was two shots behind @entity0 after shaking off jet - lag to card a 67 in the first event of the @entity5 's @entity73			1
' i got here tuesday morning and have n't really been feeling my best the last couple of days , ' said @entity59 , who was knocked out in the group stage in the defence of his @entity76 a fortnight ago			2
' it 's the first sort of long trip of the year for me and the body took a little bit of time to catch up			0
thankfully i felt much , much better this morning and the energy level has felt good			0
' the golf course is fairly soft due to the rain			0
it 's playing very long ( 7,600 yards ) , but the greens are very receptive and you can attack a few pins			0
' i 've had a lot of yardage in my hand most of the day out there			0
we counted up , i think i had seven iron shots from outside of 200 yards on this golf course			0
' certainly for a guy like me who does n't hit it maybe as far as some of the other guys , i have to be precise with my iron play and putt well , and i putted well today			0
that was one of the keys			0
' after a disappointing start to the series @entity105 recovered to sign off for a level - par 72 @entity59 's @entity40 team - mates @entity108 and @entity110 were among a six - strong group on four under par which also featured @entity114 's @entity62 , who won his first @entity5 event - the @entity116 - on his 228th appearance at the start of october			1
@entity62 started on the back nine and covered it in 32 before picking up another shot on the third , the 34 - year - old dropping his only shot of the day on the ninth when his approach plugged in a greenside bunker			2
@entity105 signed for a level - par 72 after recovering from being four over par after his first four holes , the world number six having run up a triple - bogey eight on the par - five 13th			1
but @entity130 struggled to a two - over - par 74 which contained five bogeys and three birdies and left the world number 43 joint 62nd in the 78 - strong field .			1
