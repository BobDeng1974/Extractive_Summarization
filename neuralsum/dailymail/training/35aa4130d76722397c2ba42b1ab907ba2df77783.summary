when @entity1 named its latest lightning connector it may have been more pioneering than first thought as a team of scientists have now used the power of a firebolt to charge a mobile phone			1
researchers from @entity9 used an alternating current , powered by a transformer , and were able to recreate a bolt of electricity by passing 200,000 volts across an 11 - inch gap			1
this generated the same heat , light and charge produced by a bolt of lighting , which was then used to charge the battery on a @entity23 925 phone			1

this generated the same heat , light and charge produced by a bolt of lighting			1
the charge was then passed through a second , controlling transformer , that connected to the phone 's battery			2
it took just a single bolt to charge the phone			0
' for most of us , lightning can be a truly terrifying , powerful and awe - inspiring force of nature			0
' but boffins from @entity23 and the @entity9 put their heads together to try and tame the beast , ' said @entity62 on the @entity64 blog			2
' they succeeded , and in a world ’s first they were able to use simulated lightning to charge a @entity23 phone			1
' @entity69 from the university passed the extremely high voltage across a gap between two conducting tubes in order to generate the bolt			0
the charge was then passed through a second , controlling transformer , connected to the phone 's battery			2
' we were amazed to see that the @entity23 circuitry somehow stabilised the noisy signal , allowing the battery to be charged ' added @entity69			0
' this discovery proves that the device can be charged with a current that passes through the air , and is a huge step towards understanding a natural power like lightning and harnessing its energy			0
' @entity92 is created from static electricity that forms when the balance of the electric charge between a cloud and the earth is disrupted			2
this disruption occurs during storms , as clouds move and fill with rain			0
simulated lightning is touted as an alternative power source in places where electricity is scarce			0
however , @entity23 sales boss @entity106 said : ' we are n’t recommending people try this experiment at home			0
' the electric charge was passed through a second , controlling transformer , connected to the phone 's battery			0
it took just a single bolt to charge the @entity118 handset , pictured			0

scientists recreated lightning in a *lab* at the @entity9
they used a transformer to send 200,000 volts across an 11 - inch gap
this created the same level of heat , light and charge produced by lightning
the electricity was then used to charge a @entity23 phone
