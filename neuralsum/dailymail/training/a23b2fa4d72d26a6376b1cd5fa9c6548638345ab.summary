@entity1 commercial was supposed to make young girls feel empowered by using the phrase ' like a girl ' as a positive description , rather than an insult			1
but after it aired during sunday night 's game , sour @entity8 users created the hashtag ' # likeaboy ' to demand they got some attention too			1
' can we get a # @entity16 commercial too please ? , ' one @entity8 user , @entity14 , wrote			2
the commercial contrasts responses from a group of young adults with responses from a group of young girls when they are asked to run , throw and fight ' like a girl '			1
mocking : for its @entity1 commercial , @entity1 ' asked a group of young people to run , fight or throw ' like a girl ' and filmed their mocking responses fighters : but when they asked young girls the same thing , their responses were determined and powerful the first group mock girls by running dramatically , flailing their arms and legs and weakly attempting to throw a ball			1
by contrast , the young girls run , throw and fight with determination			1
when one is asked what it means to ' run like a girl ' , she responds : ' it means run fast as you can			1
' but male viewers were n't happy at being left out			0
' seriously # likeagirl is the most insulting commercial ever and there better be a # likeaboy commercial , ' @entity48 wrote on @entity8			1
@entity52 added : ' # @entity16 because i can actually run and throw			2
' ' hopefully one day men can have equality and treated the same # @entity57 , ' @entity54 added			0
left out : after it aired , viewers took to @entity8 to claim boys should get the same treatment , above and below as more self - proclaimed ' meninists ' - men who believe they need their own movement to counter feminism - ranted about inequality , other viewers started to take note			2
' seconds after # @entity70 started trending , someone created # @entity16 bc masculinity needs constant reassurance & attention , ' wrote one user with the handle @ @entity74			0
another user named @entity76 added : ' the difference between like a boy and like a girl is that " @entity82 " has never been used as a generalized insult against men			0
' others used the men 's new @entity8 handle to deride them			2
one user , @ @entity87 , wrote : ' when women get a commercial dedicated to feminism and empowerment , get annoyed and start making fun of it # @entity16			0
' speaking out : but after their complaints , men and women started fighting back by using the new hashtag another , @entity100 , added : ' throw a tantrum that there 's one commercial about girls in 4 hour event centered around masculinity @entity82 ' despite the outcry , many @entity1 viewers commended @entity1 for the empowering advert			1
' # @entity70 is the best thing to happen			0
ever , ' wrote @entity109			0
@entity110 added : ' to boys making fun of the # @entity114 commercial : i hope @entity116 blesses you with a baby girl and i wan na see you tell her what shes incapable of			0

always ' @entity1 commercial shows a group of people being asked to run , fight or throw ' like a girl ' and their mocking responses
when young girls are asked to do the same , they run as fast as they can
after the commercial aired , men took to @entity8 to complain that there was not also a commercial for them and started the hashtag ' # likeaboy '
other @entity8 users *slammed* them for the idea
