@entity1 may be the presumptive @entity2 frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race , but she is by no means the party 's ' inevitable ' nominee , a likely challenger said thursday			1
' maybe that 's the way it is today , ' former @entity7 gov. @entity6 acknowledged on @entity12 's ' @entity11 ' program			1
' most years there is the inevitable frontrunner			0
and that inevitable frontrunner is inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable , ' he added			0
not ' inevitable ' ? former @entity7 gov. @entity6 threw cold water on the idea that his party will give @entity1 a neasy route to a presidential nomination @entity21 : @entity22 faced bruising questions on tuesday at the @entity24 from a crush of reorters fixated on ' email-gate ' the timing of @entity6 's jab is notable			1
@entity22 is embroiled in controversy about her use of a private email account for her entire four years as secretary of state , and her tuesday press conference did little to quell the furor			1
but @entity6 seemed to dismiss the growing scandal			2
even if the federal government had an iron - clad retention policy that covered every agency , he said , it 's not the sort of thing he wants to campaign on			0
' none of that would make a hill of difference , ' @entity6 insisted , to @entity49 struggling to make ends meet in a time of slow economic growth			2
@entity22 's never - ending email story is ' not the issue that 's going to restore our economy , ' the former governor said			0
' people do n't care so much about email policies			2
' still , he said it was ' important ' for the former secretary of state to follow federal laws and regulations			2
a @entity66 report thursday said that congressional @entity2 are still desperate for mrs. @entity1 to run in 2016 , saying she is ' simply too big to fail			1
' while she tops all polls on who @entity2 would pick for president , @entity6 countered the notion that the most powerful woman in @entity49 politics was a lock for the nomination			1
and he stressed that if he threw his hat in the ring , he would not be aiming for a consolation prize like the vice presidency or a cabinet post			0
' i would be running not only to win but to govern well , to make the case to the people of the country there are better choices we can make together that will make wages go up and to make college more affordable for our kids again , ' @entity6 said			1
' we do n't have any announced candidates yet , ' he noted , ' but i 've never run a bad race and i 've never gone all out when i 've gone all in			1
' timing : the ' @entity11 ' appearance on @entity12 came during a week when @entity22 's feet are being held to the fire in what 's being called ' email-gate ' he said he expected a ' robust conversation ' among @entity2 during the campaign			1
but @entity6 appeared unwilling to unsheathe the knives just yet , declining to say whether @entity22 did anything wrong in her email kerfuffle			2
he said he will announce his political intentions this spring			0
@entity22 observers expect her to do the same			0
last week , when @entity7 's long - serving senator @entity107 announced she would not seek re-election in 2016 , instead of jumping into the battle to replace her , @entity6 begged off			1
still , he has a long way to go â€“ on the calendar and in polls			0
an @entity115 survey this week showed @entity22 with 86 percent support , versus just 11 percent for @entity6			0
' am i really up to 11 percent ? ' he asked with a grin .			0

@entity6 went on @entity12 and said if he runs for president he ' would be running not only to win but to govern well '
' we do n't have any announced candidates yet , ' he said , ' but i 've never run a bad race '
interview comes as @entity1 is under fire for keeping her email *communications* off governmet servers as secretary of state
@entity2 is still counting on her to carry the day but *primary* elections wo n't *happen* until early 2016
