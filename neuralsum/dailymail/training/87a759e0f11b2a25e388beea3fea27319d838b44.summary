by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:51 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 10:39 est , 17 april 2013 the defense attorney for @entity3 has claimed his client was suffering from a mental illness caused by a deep dependency on his ex-wife when he murdered his three young daughters last summer			1
@entity3 has admitted to killing his three daughters - 11 - year - old @entity10 , eight - year - old @entity11 and @entity12 , five , - on july 10 last year , but claims he was not responsible due to mental illness			1
defense attorney @entity14 said his client became mentally unstable following his divorce due to depression which was compounded by the personality disorder involving his dependence on his ex-wife			2
the killings , @entity14 told jurors , were in some ways not about people ; they were about the dependency , which stemmed from his childhood relationships with his parents and later transferred to @entity27			2
‘ this crime is deeply rooted in @entity3 's dependency , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ that 's where all this comes from			0
’ both sides made closing arguments tuesday , april 16 , in @entity3 's insanity trial , reports @entity47			1
but prosecutor @entity48 countered in his closing statement by saying there was nothing puzzling or mysterious about the crimes ; @entity3 killed his three girls because he was jealous and angry			1
horror : @entity54 , 11 , @entity55 , 8 , and @entity56 , 5 , were found dead in their home after their father cut their throats ‘ please do not be fooled into thinking that just because a father murders his children that he must be insane , ’ @entity48 said			1
" angry that his wife left him and would n't take him back , " @entity48 said			0
@entity3 was in control of his actions and made a clear choice , the prosecutor said			1
" he chose the satisfaction of revenge over the satisfaction of being a father , " @entity48 said			0
@entity3 's fate is now in the hands of a @entity78 jury			1
should the jury find @entity3 not responsible for the killings , he would be committed to a mental health institution , possibly for life			1
if found responsible , he will be sentenced to life in prison			0
last week @entity3 's aunt had told the court that the killer was ' unplanned by his mom and unwanted by his dad '			2
@entity3 argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his dependency on his ex-wife @entity92 @entity93 appeared at the trial along with @entity3 's mother , father and prison psychiatrist			1
ms fix also said that the family had a history of depression			0
his father also testified that @entity3 was a difficult baby who did not like to be touched			2
@entity103 testified that his son @entity3 was a rebellious and belligerent teen who had some ' run - ins with the law '			1
the elder @entity3 says his son stole a gun , brought it to high school and was expelled			2
however he admitted that his son became a better person after marrying his wife @entity92 and that he liked being a father to his three daughters			2
@entity103 said that when his son 's marriage broke down and his estranged wife began seeing someone else then he began to behave strangely and made deeply alarming remarks			0
according to @entity120 , mr @entity119 said : ' there was one phone call received around two o'clock in the morning			0
he was very despondent , depressed			0
tragic lives taken too soon : @entity10 , 11 , five - year - old @entity12 and eight - year - old @entity11 ( left to right ) charged : @entity3 , 34 , of @entity124 , @entity125 , faces three counts of first - degree intentional homicide - each a mandatory life sentence if convicted for stabbing his three daughters to death ' sounded like he was always weeping			1
that he wanted to do terrible things to @entity132 ' boyfriend			0
he wanted to hurt the girls to show how much pain he was in			0
' the murder suspect 's mother @entity135 told jurors that her son became extremely depressed when he and his wife @entity92 broke up			0
she said that mental illness was common in other relatives			0
ms @entity93 said that she had been deeply concerned that @entity3 was going to harm his daughters when he made phone calls to her			1
dr @entity144 , a prison psychiatrist , also took the stand			0
he explained that while @entity146 was depressed , he did not appear to have a mental condition that would legally support an insanity defense			0
@entity144 says @entity3 told him what happened at the house was a ' spur of the moment thing '			2
@entity3 told @entity144 he tried to help @entity12 find her shoes , and the next thing he knew , he had his hands on her neck and was strangling her before then slitting his three daughters ' throats .			1

trial to *decide* if @entity3 , 35 , was insane when he killed his three daughters - 11 - year - old @entity10 , 8 - year - old @entity11 and 5 - year - old @entity12
