by @entity0 when my father cuts the grass , leaving neat parallel lines up and down the lawn , his two - year - old grandson — my son @entity1 — follows him with his toy mower			1
wherever @entity8 is , so too is his little shadow — copying , watching , unconsciously learning new skills from the grandfather he adores			2
@entity1 can count up to 12 : he has learned this with the gentle guidance of my father , a retired accountant , who bought him his first book of numbers			2
she has the capacity to distract my one - year - old daughter @entity24 with a puzzle or a picture book while spooning food into her mouth that she will not eat for me			1
i had not realised just how valuable my own parents ’ presence in my children ’s lives would be until i moved back home with them — and brought my husband and two children with me			1
i now appreciate the wonder of grandparents : they know how to quell an infant tantrum , how to cajole a reluctant baby into eating			2
this is because they have experience and wisdom			2
after all , they ’ve practised with their own children			1
like so many 30 and 40 - somethings , financial constraints mean my husband and i can not yet afford a home in modern - day @entity57			1
so , 18 months ago , we moved back in with my parents			1
and the experience has taught me so much that i ’m not sure we are in a hurry to leave			2
why ? nine years ago , my husband @entity23 and i decided to start a new life in @entity65			1
for some years it was wonderful , but after my first baby , my heart began to ache with longing for my parents			1
when they visited i was entranced by the way their smiling eyes would lock with my baby son ’s			2
my mother had an amazing knack of soothing @entity1			0
when he cried , she ’d scoop him up and he ’d instantly relax in her arms			0
i had left my childhood home in @entity80 , north @entity81 at 19 intending to forge my own path			0
i did n’t for a moment see myself returning to live with my parents again 15 years later , along with my own family			1
but life does n’t ever go to plan			0
if it did , the four of us would be making a home of our own , with @entity23 and i scratching our children ’s heights on a door frame door			1
instead , we have joined the boomerang generation			0
we are back in the neat , four - bedroom , suburban semi where my parents raised my sister , @entity97 , 31 , and i. and we ’re not the only ones			1
figures from the @entity101 recently revealed that in 2013 , more than 3.3 million adults in the @entity57 aged between 20 and 34 — 26 per cent of this age group — were living with their parents , because of the economic downturn			1
this was almost 667,000 more than in 1996 , the first year such figures were available			0
@entity0 and @entity23 moved in with her parents after leaving @entity65 18 months and have no plans to move out so , how did @entity23 and i end up back home ? i had read @entity112 at @entity113 and while living there i met @entity23 , a graphic designer from @entity65			1
after graduating , @entity23 and i moved to his home country			1
property was a third of the price it was in the @entity57 capital , so for the cost of a two - bed flat in a dreary @entity81 suburb we could live in a spacious house with a garden			1
i was working for a national newspaper , while @entity23 had a children ’s book published and he ’d become a freelance designer and illustrator			1
in november 2010 , a few months before we married , we bought a home in @entity134 for £ 250,000			0
when @entity1 was born in december 2011 , he made our house a home , i concluded			0
and yet when he turned one , and we had another baby on the way , the pull of my family in @entity57 had become wrenching			1
@entity23 ’s parents are divorced and lived too far away to visit regularly			1
my parents had been to stay with us twice in @entity1 ’s first six months			2
when it came for them to go back to @entity81 my heart almost broke			2
the attraction of a life in @entity149 close to my mum and dad was stronger than the lure of our comfortable lifestyle in @entity65			0
@entity155 , in january 2013 , we moved back with only the sketch - iest of plans			1
there was one thing we were sure about , though — we ’d stay with my mum and dad until we found our feet			0
that was 18 months ago , and we are still no closer to having a home of our own			0
perhaps we will be ready to leave in a year			0
we do not really know			0
yet even as i contemplate leaving my parents , i feel ambivalent			2
if i do find work , if we find a home , we will still rely on them for childcare			0
without their help , we would be paying full - time nursery fees , making a home once again unaffordable			2
but more than that , my parents ’ constant presence in their grandchildren ’s lives has enriched them immeasurably			2
almost three - quarter of a million @entity57 families have three or more generations living under one roof			1
the other day @entity1 announced he knew his right hand from his left — ‘ @entity8 taught me ! ’ and when he recites his numbers , and i watch my father ’s proud smile , my heart does a little leap of joy			0
yet there are times when i feel , though my parents make no complaint , that we must have tried their patience			2
they should be enjoying their empty nest			0
i look at the children ’s playroom and know it should be used for entertaining			2
i look at the garden which we have converted into a mini obstacle course			0
we ’ve taken the bedrooms on the first floor , and my parents had to retreat to the converted loft to sleep			2
my parents are unfailingly tolerant , and despite the chaos , my mum has only once implored me to tidy up the children ’s mess			1
caring for two young children is a young person ’s job , so i know mum and dad must get tired , especially as the energy of a two - year - old boy is inexhaustible			1
‘ let ’s play football , @entity215 , ’ @entity1 will often beg , and my mother will dutifully spend the whole morning kicking a ball to and fro			0
after , i ’ll beg her to go upstairs for a rest and she will insist she is ok			0
but their energy does not flag			0
if @entity23 is not home in time for bedtime , @entity220 will improvise a story for @entity1 , who listens entranced			1
yet while i am moved beyond words by the bond between my children and my parents , i desperately wish we were making memories in our own home			1
@entity0 claims two - year - old @entity1 ( right ) and one - year - old @entity24 ( left ) have learnt a lot from their grandparents one day , our little family will have its own place			1
but from shared - living , i ’ve learned that having the people you love around you when you are bringing up babies is immeasurably wonderful			1
and @entity1 and @entity24 have gained most			0
i watch their daily interaction with their grandparents			0
i see my dad teaching @entity1 how to play golf in the garden , i watch my mother rock @entity24 to sleep in her arms			0
such inter-generational living is the norm in some families in my @entity251 culture , although it was n’t a way of life my parents or i ever intended for ourselves			1
but it has enriched us all			0
when i was exhausted after sleepless nights with a teething toddler , my mother was there to help			0
when @entity23 and i have looked at each other in despair , my father has been there quietly supportive , proffering advice if we needed it			1
my parents ’ magnanimity and generosity is humbling , and i am constantly amazed by the depth of their selflessness			2
but @entity8 is 68 and my mother , 63			0
they should be downsizing to somewhere quiet and taking frequent holidays and entertaining friends for lunch and supper			0
@entity23 and i miss our privacy and independence			1
we are sad , from time to time , about how life is			0
but we are also hopeful			0
and above all , we are supremely , boundlessly grateful			0

@entity0 moved back in with her parents with husband @entity23 and children
more than 3.3 million adults aged 20 - 34 in the @entity57 are living with parents
