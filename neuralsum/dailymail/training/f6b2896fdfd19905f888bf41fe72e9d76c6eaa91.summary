when their five - year - old pestered them to let him play on their @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity7 ’s first instinct was to say no. but faced with the distraction of a house full of visitors , along with their son ’s insistence that the game he wanted to play was free , and you might understand why they eventually said yes			2
that decision was a costly one			2
the next day they found out their son @entity20 ’s little game - playing session had cost them £ 1,700			1
although @entity39 has since refunded the full amount , the family said it has been a tough lesson to learn			1
@entity20 had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called @entity45 , which involves touching the @entity3 screen to aim ninja - style weapons at cartoon zombies			1
his parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home			2
but by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen , @entity20 was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ ammunition ’			2
his mother knew nothing about his subsequent spending spree until she saw emails from @entity58 the following day listing what he had bought			1
‘ @entity20 was pestering us to let him have a go on the @entity3 , ’ she said from the family home in @entity61 , near @entity62			2
‘ he kept saying it was a free game so my husband put in the passcode and handed it to him			0
the app involves throwing darts and bombs at zombies and users can get extras ... but at a cost the game is free but the creators get their money from extra weapons ‘ it worried me when he asked for the password but i had a look at the game , it said it was free so i did n’t think there would be a problem			1
' we had lots of visitors in the house and were both a little preoccupied			0
i woke up monday morning and looked at my emails and had loads from @entity58			1

‘ i ca n’t believe he was able to spend so much , ’ said mrs kitchen , a mother of five who runs a children ’s entertainment business with her husband			0
‘ it was far too easy a thing for him to do and more should be done to limit stuff like this from happening			0
‘ i told @entity20 he ’d better get ready for bed and run and hide before @entity115 got home			0
‘ through his tears he turned back and said “ but where can i hide ? ” bless him – that stopped me being angry but of course , it ’s a lot of money			0
’ @entity20 said : ‘ i said to @entity115 can you put the passcode for the game , he said no and then i said it was free so he said yes			0
the next day it cost lots of money			0
i was worried and i felt sad			0
i ’m not sure how i did it , i thought it was free			0
‘ i ’m banned from the @entity3 now			0
’ mr @entity28 , 44 , said : ‘ i was livid			1
but @entity20 was very sorry so i could n’t stay mad at him for long			0
i ’m relieved that they have said they are going to give us back our money			0
’ an @entity39 spokesman said it was vital that parents kept their passcodes safe and said software was available to prevent children from using the @entity143			1
