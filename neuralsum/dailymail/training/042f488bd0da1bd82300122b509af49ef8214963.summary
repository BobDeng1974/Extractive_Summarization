a handwritten notebook by @entity1 , the @entity3 code - breaking genius depicted by @entity4 in the @entity6 - nominated @entity5 , is going on the auction block			1
the 56 - page manuscript was written at the time the @entity11 mathematician and computer science pioneer was working to break the seemingly unbreakable @entity13 codes used by the @entity14 throughout @entity3 it is being sold by @entity16 in @entity17 on april 13 and is expected to bring at least $ 1 million			1
it is believed to be the only extensive @entity1 manuscript known to exist , the auctioneer said the notebook contains @entity1 's complex mathematical and computer science notations			1

it dates from 1942 , when @entity1 was trying to break the seemingly unbreakable code with his team of cryptanalysts at @entity11 's @entity3 code and cypher school @entity32			1
in one entry @entity1 writes about a complex calculus notation			2
' the @entity37 notation i find extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one i understood the best once ! it certainly implies that some relation between x and y has been laid down eg , y = x2 +3x ...
