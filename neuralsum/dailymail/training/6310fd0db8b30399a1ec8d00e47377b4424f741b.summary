unidentified material that washed ashore in @entity2 and is being examined for any link to the lost @entity5 plane is unlikely to have come from the jet , an official revealed today			1
the @entity7 had been scrutinising photos of the object , which washed ashore six miles east of @entity10 in @entity2 state			1
but @entity12 , chief commissioner of the bureau , said an initial analysis of the material - which appeared to be sheet metal with rivets - suggested it was not from @entity17			1
at this stage , we are not getting excited			0
’ he added that the analysis of the material would likely be completed overnight and a formal statement issued tomorrow			0
@entity10 is near @entity2 's south - western tip , about 190 miles from @entity30 , where the search has been headquartered			1
meanwhile , @entity2 's prime minister said today that failure to find any clue in the most likely crash site of the lost jet would not spell the end of the search			1
this was because officials plan soon to bring in more powerful sonar equipment that can delve deeper beneath the @entity42			0
objects washed up east of @entity10 ( pictured ) were being looked at to see if they were from the missing flight looking : captain flt lt @entity45 of the @entity47 @entity46 flying a p - 3 orion during a search trying to locate missing @entity24 over the @entity42 the search coordination centre said a robotic submarine , the @entity52 's @entity51 21 , had scanned more than 80 per cent of the 120 - sq mile seabed search zone off the @entity56 west coast , creating a three - dimensional sonar map of the ocean floor			1
nothing of interest had been found			0
' we do not consider this likely to be of use to our search for @entity24			1
at this stage , we are not getting excited ' @entity12 , @entity7 chief commissioner the 2.8 - mile deep search area is a circle 12 miles wide around an area where sonar equipment picked up a signal on april 8 consistent with a plane 's black boxes			1
but the batteries powering those signals are now believed dead			0
defence minister @entity76 said @entity2 was consulting with @entity5 , @entity77 and the @entity78 on the next phase of the search for the plane , which disappeared on march 8			1
details on the next phase are likely to be announced next week			0
mr @entity76 said more powerful towed side - scan commercial sonar equipment would probably be deployed , similar to the remote - controlled subs that found @entity86 12,500f under the @entity87 in 1985 and the @entity56 @entity89 wreck @entity90 in the @entity42 off the @entity56 coast , north of the current search area , in 2008			2
@entity77 relatives of passengers on the missing @entity17 rest during a meeting ‘ the next phase , i think , is that we step up with potentially a more powerful , more capable side - scan sonar to do deeper water , ’ mr @entity76 said			2
' the next phase , i think , is that we step up with potentially a more powerful , more capable side - scan sonar to do deeper water ' @entity76 , defence minister while the @entity51 had less than one - fifth of the seabed search area to complete , mr @entity76 estimated that task would take another two weeks			2
@entity56 prime minister @entity103 said the airliner 's probable impact zone was 430 miles long and 50 miles wide			2
a new search strategy would be adopted if nothing is found in the current seabed search zone			0
‘ if at the end of that period we find nothing , we are not going to abandon the search , we may well rethink the search , but we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery , ’ mr @entity103 told reporters			0
reflective : a man stands in front of a billboard as @entity77 relatives of passengers on the missing @entity17 have a meeting at the @entity122 in @entity123 map : a handout image released by the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity2 , shows the current planned search areas in the @entity42 , west of @entity2 ‘ we owe it to the families of the 239 people on board , we owe it to the hundreds of millions - indeed billions - of people who travel by air to try to get to the bottom of this			1
' we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery ' @entity103 , @entity56 prime minister ‘ the only way we can get to the bottom of this is to keep searching the probable impact zone until we find something or until we have searched it as thoroughly as human ingenuity allows at this time			0
’ the focus of the next search phase will be decided by continuing analysis of information including flight data and sound detections of the suspected beacons , mr @entity76 said			2
‘ a lot of this seabed has not even been hydrographically surveyed before - some of it has - but we 're flying blind , ’ he said , adding that the seabed in the vicinity of the search was up to four miles deep			2
anger : a @entity77 relative of a passenger on missing flight at a meeting at @entity122 in @entity123 did not crash : dr @entity166 says missing @entity17 ( file photo ) could not have crashed because modern communications systems meant that it could not simply disappear off the radar the search centre said an air search involving 10 planes was suspended for a second day because of heavy seas and poor visibility			0
but 12 ships would join wednesday 's search of an expanse covering 14,500 sq miles , centred 1,000 miles north - west of @entity30			1
radar and satellite data show the jet veered far off course on march 8 for unknown reasons during its flight from @entity184 , @entity5 , to @entity123			1
an analysis indicates it would have run out of fuel in the remote section of ocean where the search has been focused			0
not one piece of confirmed debris has been found since the massive multinational hunt began .			0
