lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of the disease			1
more than 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the @entity79			2
often in the early stages of the disease there are no signs or symptoms			0

the disease mainly affects older people			0
it is rare in people younger than 40 , while rates rise sharply with age			0
