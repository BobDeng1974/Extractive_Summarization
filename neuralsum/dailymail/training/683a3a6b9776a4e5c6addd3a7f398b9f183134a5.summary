by @entity0 , business correspondent families should fix their mortgages to protect themselves against ‘ a real risk of exposure to rising interest rates ’ , a senior member of the @entity2 said yesterday			1
mortgages have never been cheaper since the @entity2 cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent nearly five years ago , the lowest level in its 320 - year history			1
but the comments , from @entity13 , will fuel families ’ fears that rates are set to rise sooner rather than later			0
mortgages have never been cheaper since the @entity2 cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent nearly five years ago , the lowest level in its 320 - year history they came ahead of a survey from the @entity19 saying house prices are rising at an ‘ unsustainable ’ rate and are a nightmare for people trying to get on to the property ladder or to climb up it			1
it says the problem is fuelled by the toxic combination of rising numbers of people wanting to buy but a chronic lack of homes for sale			1
while many parts of the country are not affected , the problem exists in @entity37 , many parts of the @entity39 as well as various ‘ micro markets ’ – particular villages or neighbourhoods – around the country			2
grilled by the treasury select committee yesterday , mr @entity13 , who sits on the @entity2 ’s financial policy committee , was asked about fixed - rate mortgages			1
the @entity19 say house prices are rising at an ' unsustainable ' rate and are a nightmare for people trying to get on to the property ladder he said that , for ‘ practical purposes ’ , interest rates in @entity54 are ‘ close to zero ’			1
mr @entity13 added : ‘ so you have also got to make a judgment about the future			0
certainly my judgment would be this would be a good time [ to fix your mortgage ]			0
’ mr @entity13 , who worked at @entity63 for 23 years , does not sit on the @entity2 ’s interest rate setting committee			1
his advice comes as the @entity67 said yesterday nearly nine in ten families who are taking out a mortgage are choosing a fixed - rate loan , the highest number since records began			0
@entity2 governor @entity73 has urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come one expert said yesterday homeowners must accept that the @entity2 ’s base rate is ‘ only going to go up			1
’ at present , the financial markets expect the @entity2 ’s base rate will be 3 per cent in five years ’ time			1
in november , 88 per cent of people who took out a new mortgage or remortgaged their existing deal opted for a fixed - rate loan , according to the @entity67			2
a fixed - rate loan means they pay a fixed interest rate for a set period of time , such as a five - year deal charging a rate of 3 per cent			2
the @entity67 said fixed rate mortgages have a ‘ strong attraction ’ , particularly as they are so much cheaper than other types of deals at the moment			0
at the same committee hearing , @entity73 , the @entity2 ’s governor , also urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come			2
he said : ‘ we need to ensure that lenders and households consider their ability to service their mortgages and retain their homes in more adverse , higher interest rate , scenarios			0
’ mr @entity73 also said house prices are likely to continue rising robustly until the middle of next year as the recovery picks up pace			0
he told @entity116 : ‘ our general expectation has been for a continuation of current momentum – house price momentum , mortgage activity , credit growth momentum – into 2014 , before decelerating around the middle of 2015 towards 2016			0
’ across the board : house prices are rising in all regions but there is a big gap in the pace of increase outpaced : @entity135 prices paid by first - time buyers are rising faster than the wider market and those paid by home movers , the @entity133 data shows			0
but @entity19 warned of ‘ a growing risk of another house price boom ’ and said urgent action is needed by the @entity2			1
the latest official figures , from the @entity133 , show house prices in @entity37 are rising at 11.6 per cent a year and 4.5 per cent in the @entity39			0
the @entity19 report , published today , said demand is being fuelled by the cheapest mortgages in history , the government ’s help to buy scheme as well as the increased availability of loans for people with deposits of less than ten per cent			2
official figures reveal house prices are nearly 80 per cent higher in @entity37 than they are in the rest of the country .			0
