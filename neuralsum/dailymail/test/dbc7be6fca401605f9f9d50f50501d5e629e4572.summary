@entity0 has been heavily linked with the newly created role of director of @entity4 cricket – and for captain @entity5 the move can not come soon enough if it gets him out of the commentary box			1
@entity0 is currently in the @entity8 working as part of the @entity11 's commentary team but has made no secret in his desire to replace @entity14 in the top job in @entity17 cricket			1
but in his role as a commentator for @entity21 the former @entity4 skipper put the ultimate curse on @entity5 by praising him moments before he lost his wicket in the second innings			1
@entity5 walks off after being dismissed by @entity26 @entity5 kicks out in frustration after being dismissed for 13 caught by @entity28 @entity0 praised @entity5 in the commentary box moments before he was dismissed @entity5 has struggled with the bat over the last year and lost the one day captaincy at the end of last year			1
the @entity4 captain scored 11 in the first innings but was looking better in the seconding innings which lead @entity0 praise him in the commentary box			2
he said : ' i know it is early and i know they will say it is commentator 's curse , but i am watching his ( @entity5 's ) movement			1
and the movement is so much better than last year			2
you watch his right foot , he goes back with his left foot now ... ' but before @entity0 could finish his sentence @entity5 was tempted to follow a @entity26 delivery outside off stump and squirted a waist - high catch to gully for 13			1
despite being the favourite for the director of cricket job , @entity0 is seeking more clarity over the role			2
speaking earlier this week , he said : ' i think the role needs to be defined , what exactly it is and what the team require			0
i do n't think anyone can say whether they are interested or not until then			0
' all i 've said is i 'd like to know what that role is , as @entity65 has said , and @entity66			0
all of us would be ¬ interested if the role was right			0
so it 's just a case of waiting to see			0
' but despite an @entity72 summer on the horizon , @entity0 added : ' i do n't think the @entity74 have to panic			2
they have to take their time			0
' we have a big summer coming up , but this is about the future of @entity4 cricket			0

@entity0 said @entity5 's movement had improved since last year
@entity5 was caught for 13 moments after @entity0 's praise
@entity5 has struggled with the bat over the last year
