a lesbian couple have spent £ 13,000 having @entity2 semen and fertility treatment shipped to their @entity5 home so their child will look like a @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , both 34 , have chosen to buy sperm from @entity2 because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes and because @entity5 sperm ' does n't cut the mustard '			1
the married couple , from @entity17 , @entity18 , used @entity8 's eggs for the insemination after receiving £ 300 - a - time vials of @entity2 sperm in the post and later successfully conceived via @entity24			1
@entity9 and @entity25 ( right ) , from @entity18 , have chosen to buy sperm from @entity2 because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes just like them and because @entity5 sperm ' does n't cut the mustard ' the married couple used @entity8 's eggs for the insemination after receiving £ 300 - a - time vials of @entity2 sperm in the post			1
@entity9 is now pregnant and they are expecting their baby in late july @entity9 put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and , after a heart - breaking miscarriage , she is now five months pregnant			2
@entity8 , a buildings manager , said : ' @entity2 sperm is the best in the world and such high quality			2
' @entity5 sperm is more than double the price and just does n't cut the mustard			1
' at least with a @entity49 we knew our baby would be attractive and blonde like us			0
' i suppose he would look a bit like a @entity7 , but we want our son to look like us			0
' the pair , who got legally married in february , ordered their @entity2 semen from @entity60 - the world 's largest sperm bank which has a motto of : ‘ congratulations , it ’s a @entity7 ’			1
however , after inseminating @entity9 with four vials of @entity2 sperm , she had still not fallen pregnant so they forked out £ 5,000 for a round of @entity24 treatment			1
the couple said they chose to go to @entity2 to buy the sperm because they wanted their child to look like them - blonde with blue eyes			2
both women are naturally blonde , although @entity9 dyes her hair dark brown @entity9 ( left ) put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and , after a heart - breaking miscarriage , she is now five months pregnant			2
the pair are delighted with the results of @entity24 @entity9 shows of her baby bump ( left ) while partner @entity8 ( centre ) and a friend look on			1
right : the couple pictured on their wedding day last year			0
they said they are ' so pleased ' they finally have a baby on the way that worked but she miscarried , so they spent another £ 5,000 on @entity24 and have so far bought ten vials of @entity103 sperm			1
@entity9 is due to give birth on july 23 but the couple want to keep the sex of their fair - haired baby secret for the time being			0
@entity9 , a chef , who dyes her hair brown , said : ' we are just so pleased that after spending £ 13,000 we finally have a little one on the way			1
' it does n't matter that we have rinsed our savings and scrimped and saved for years to get where we are			0
' her partner added : ' with my eggs and @entity9 carrying the baby , he or she really is ours and we could n't be happier			2
' the couple are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their little one , but have chosen to keep the sex a secret for now @entity8 and @entity9 are among thousands of @entity5 women who are flocking to @entity2 to buy foreign sperm @entity2 sperm now accounts for a third of the total used by @entity5 fertility clinics			1
women from all over the world are choosing to go @entity136 when they need a sperm donor , with shortages of homegrown sperm and better service cited as the main reasons for doing so			0
according to dr @entity143 , a fertility expert at the @entity144 , people prefer going abroad because of a lack of @entity5 sperm donors			1
he said : ' we do n't have enough donors in the @entity5 to meet the national need			0
we do n't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough donors - even when men want to donate			0
' often there simply is n't the size and scale within small @entity156 clinics to consider having a donor recruitment programme - plus if you 're not confident that sufficient men are going to ring up and become sperm donors , the economics of it simply are n't going to work			0
' @entity2 clinic @entity60 – which is the world 's largest sperm bank – is also popular because of its customer service , according to experts			2
@entity167 , ceo of the @entity168 , said : ' it 's much easier for a @entity5 clinic to order sperm from @entity2 which is @entity172 - exed the next day than to try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them			1
' the @entity2 model is customer service driven			0
it knows how to deal well with customers , it has a good website , and that 's what we could do in the @entity5 as well - it 's not rocket science			2
' choice : @entity2 's sperm banks , among them @entity186 , deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales dr @entity143 added : ' @entity2 is geographically close to the @entity5			1
i think there 's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond that we have with @entity2			0
' most women flocking to @entity2 for sperm are lesbians or single women in their 30s and 40s who do not see why a lack of partner should be a barrier to motherhood			0
it is only in the past few years that there has been a ' viking invasion ' of @entity5 , due to changes in the law that banned anonymous sperm donation in @entity5 , leading to a rapid decline in donors			0
a @entity5 sperm donor has to be prepared for the fact that any resulting child will have the right to trace them at the age of 18			2
however , @entity2 sperm donors are n't anonymous and the detail given about the donor is extensive , which is part of the attraction			0
with a @entity5 sperm donor , you get a number and choice of hair colour , while @entity2 sperm donors offer detail you can imagine including family background , job description , education and pictures of the man as a baby or child			1
one expert said : ' donors write personal messages about why they are a donor			0
you even get to hear their voice			0
' the @entity241 clinic has been running for 25 years and boasts 30,000 babies born worldwide			0
but a @entity7 baby does n't come cheap , with @entity2 sperm bought over the internet and delivered to an address in @entity5 costing £ 460 .			1

they said they *ventured* abroad as @entity5 sperm ' does n't cut the mustard '
