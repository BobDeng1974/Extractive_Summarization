unhappy : @entity0 , 35 , is preparing to sue @entity1 for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification ' all the time ' @entity1 yesterday referred shock police racism allegations by @entity7 ’s brother to the force watchdog			1
describing the claims by teacher @entity0 , 35 , as a ‘ very serious matter ’ , the @entity9 passed his complaint on to the @entity13			1
in a strongly worded statement , the @entity9 said it would not tolerate ‘ any form of racism ’ and promised strong action if any of its officers were found to have acted in a ‘ racist manner ’			1
senior labour mp @entity21 said he was ‘ astonished ’ to learn of mr @entity0 ’s apparent treatment by police			1
yard boss sir @entity25 ordered an investigation hours after mr @entity0 claimed in yesterday ’s @entity27 that he had been stopped by police up to 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin			1
mr @entity0 alleges officers from @entity1 have repeatedly targeted him as part of a sustained campaign of harassment			1
the angry father of one , whose teenage brother was murdered in a racist attack in 1993 , instructed lawyers to seek redress from the @entity9 following his latest encounter with police in south @entity43			1
he said he was moved to act after he was pulled over by two officers who saw him driving his @entity45 near his home in @entity47			2
today we can reveal further details of the incident , which has sparked a new crisis in @entity53 ’s biggest police force			2
mr @entity0 said that as he approached his flat on the afternoon of november 16 , he looked at the driver of a police vehicle as he passed it and continued to his flat			1
while driving down the road , he noticed that the police vehicle had turned around and it drove towards him at ‘ great speed ’ , he said			2
the police vehicle pulled up and two officers got out to check his details			2
when he asked why he was stopped , one officer told him he was ‘ naturally suspicious ’ of him , he claimed			1
but later , he said , the other officer told him he had been stopped under @entity65 of the @entity66 1988 , which gives police the power to pull over a vehicle			1
mr @entity0 ’s lawyers said that although the law gives officers authority to stop a car , ‘ it does not cover the reason for the stop ’			1
brothers : @entity0 ( right ) pictured at home with his elder sibling @entity80 ( left ) , who was murdered they claim the officers were trying , retrospectively , to ‘ justify ’ their decision to check his details			1
a letter of complaint was sent to sir @entity25 on tuesday , naming the officers allegedly involved in the latest incident and warning of future legal proceedings			2
mr @entity0 ’s solicitor , @entity92 , said his complaint related specifically to when he was stopped at 5.20pm on november 16			1
‘ that was the straw that broke the camel ’s back , ’ he said			1
‘ that was the culmination of a course of conduct over many years which amounted to harassment and discrimination based upon his skin colour , his ethnic origin			1
’ he added : ‘ we are delighted that they [ @entity1 ] are pursuing it so quickly			2
’ family : murdered teenager @entity7 's mother @entity108 ( left ) and her son @entity109 ( right ) pictured at a memorial held in his honour in april last year mr @entity21 , chairman of the @entity112 , said : ‘ i am astonished at the way in which @entity0 seems to have been treated			1
no citizen of the @entity53 should be expected to face what appears to be a consistent campaign of stop and search			0
’ @entity1 said mr @entity0 ’s complaint would be ‘ investigated thoroughly and speedily ’			1
‘ stop and search is an important tool to combat crime and is supported by the community if it is used professionally and fairly , ’ it said			0
‘ the commissioner has made it clear that he will not tolerate any form of racism in the @entity9			2
‘ strong action will be taken against any individuals in the @entity9 if they are found to have acted in a racist manner			0
’ @entity131 : the boys ' mother @entity132 who has long campaigned to rid the police of racism mr @entity0 ’s brother was stabbed to death by a gang of five or six attackers in @entity140 , south - east @entity43 , in 1993 , at the age of 18			1
the original investigation into his death failed to solve the case and was dogged by allegations of corruption and racism			2
the @entity148 later concluded that the @entity9 was ‘ institutionally racist ’			0
only two of the killers have been convicted			0
home secretary @entity151 ( left ) has paid tribute to the campaigning work of @entity132			2
mr @entity0 sent a letter of complaint to @entity9 commissioner @entity25 ( right ) outlining his concerns @entity0 , who is engaged and has a two - year - old son , said he was ‘ angry and frustrated ’ and felt there had been little progress in the way police deal with black people			1
an @entity13 spokesman said it was considering mr @entity0 ’s complaint ‘ to determine the level of @entity13 involvement ’			1
the watchdog could decide to launch its own , independent investigation , to supervise an investigation or to refer it back to the @entity9 to carry out an internal inquiry			0
remembered : a police cctv surveillance van at the site of the @entity7 memorial stone in @entity140 , south - east @entity43 by @entity175 angry : @entity0 with his mother @entity176 stop and search powers have been an issue of huge controversy since the @entity181 report branded the police ‘ institutionally racist ’			1
but , while there has been a fall in the overall number of searches , figures suggest a black person remains far more likely to be stopped by police than somebody who is white			2
particular alarm has been raised over a police power known as @entity193			0
this allows officers to stop and search people and cars where they believe violence or disorder may be about to take place			0
a study by the @entity202 found police are ‘ significantly ’ more likely to use @entity193 of the @entity204 against black people than white people			0
the power is used most often by the @entity9 , which carried out three - quarters of the stops between 2008 and 2011 – 258,000 in total			0
the commission found that in 2008 - 09 , the @entity9 stopped 68 out of every 1,000 black people in its area			2
this fell to 32.8 per 1,000 by 2010 - 11			0
for all ethnic groups in @entity216 , it was 3.3 stops per 1,000 people in 2008/09 , falling to 1.3 in 2010/11			0
the report also highlighted huge rates of ‘ racial disproportionality ’			0
an officer in the @entity223 was 28 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person in 2010/11			0
in @entity227 the figure was 21 times , in the @entity9 11 times , and for @entity231 police it was 31 times			0
the most widely used stop and search power is section 1 of the @entity236			0
in 2010/11 , it was used on 1,222,378 people			0
the 2011 census found that 86 per cent of the population classified themselves as white			0
but , according to the latest @entity245 statistics , only 66 per cent of those stopped across @entity216 and @entity243 were white			2
some 15 per cent were black and 10 per cent were @entity246			0
the activities of the @entity9 had a huge impact on the figures			0
in @entity43 ( where just under 58 per cent of the population is white ) , only 43 per cent of those searched defined themselves as white			1
three in ten were black , and 16 per cent were @entity246			0
if the @entity9 ’s figures are stripped out of the nationwide statistics , 84 per cent of searches were on white people – broadly in line with the ethnic mix of the country			0
last year , dr @entity262 , a member of the @entity7 inquiry panel , argued that officers who targeted suspects on grounds of their skin colour alone should be prosecuted for misusing public resources .			0

@entity80 's brother @entity0 , 35 , left furious by harassment
final straw said to be when he was stopped in @entity43 in november
mother @entity108 says ' racism has not gone away '
