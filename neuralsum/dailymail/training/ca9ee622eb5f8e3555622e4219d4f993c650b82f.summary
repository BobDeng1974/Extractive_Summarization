by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor scores of @entity5 jobs could be shipped off to @entity6 under cost - saving plans being considered by health chiefs , unions have claimed			1
the country 's biggest health union , @entity9 , said the cuts could cost 900 @entity13 workers their jobs - with many going to the subcontinent			2
@entity5 @entity17 managers are set to consider the plans at a crunch board meeting tomorrow			1
health secretary @entity19 is not in control of the day - to - day running of the @entity5			1
a new body called @entity17 was created and put in charge by his predecessor @entity23 , in his controversial overhaul of the health service most of the roles under threat are low paid ' back office ' jobs , such as dealing with prescription charges , payments to @entity33 and crucial referrals for cancer screening			1
@entity9 has written to board members urging them to reconsider the plans , which emerged in agenda papers published last week			2
a spokeswoman for @entity17 confirmed to @entity40 that the proposal was due to be debated tomorrow			1
she said : ' there 's going to be some discussion at our board meeting tomorrow			1
' an @entity17 spokesman later added : ' this is a very important set of changes that we are considering for the benefit of patients and the public			1
' the aim is to free up funding from administrative costs for frontline health services			0
' we have worked closely with our staff and the unions to ensure we understand their views and concerns			2
no final decision will be made until june			0
' one of the proposals being considered is that the number of staff currently working in @entity6 would rise from about 20 to about 60			0
@entity67 , @entity9 's head of health , attacked the plan and called on @entity17 to keep the jobs in @entity13			1
she said : ' these proposals have been hammered out behind closed doors and are mired in secrecy			1
' staff are being kept in the dark about their futures and this is very upsetting and disruptive for them personally and for the service			0
' the potential loss of at least 900 jobs and the closure of dozens of offices across the @entity13 will be a bitter blow to workers and their families			0
' at a time when many companies are bringing back services from abroad , it is shameful that @entity17 is seeking to make quick savings by outsourcing some work to @entity6			2
' ordinary health staff will be furious at the revelation that @entity13 jobs could be outsourced to @entity6			0
it comes just days after the expenses claims of former health service chief sir @entity96 and his @entity17 colleagues were revealed the controversial proposals come after it emerged nine health officials from @entity17 spent almost £ 200,000 last year on fine dining , taxi fares and hotels at up to £ 500 a night			1
patients ’ groups said it was ' an absolute disgrace ' that officials cutting jobs across the @entity5 were able to enjoy such perks			2
@entity17 was set up by ministers , as part of @entity23 's overhaul of the health service , and was headed by sir @entity96 until he stood down recently			1
sir @entity96 billed taxpayers for a total of £ 32,000 during 2013 - 14 , the figures show , including £ 6,700 on taxis			0
the 69 claims for taxis and cars include one fare of more than £ 500 for a journey from @entity124 to @entity125			0
the highest individual bill was for @entity127 , national director for patients and information , who spent £ 46,000 during the year — including more than £ 21,000 on hotels and dining , with claims of up to £ 370 a night			0
mr @entity127 , who is responsible for the troubled programme to centralise gp records , also spent almost £ 7,000 on air fares			0
@entity137 , @entity5 chief nursing officer , spent more than £ 27,000 in total , including £ 8,000 on hotels and dining , the records show			2

the sums claimed include £ 491 on a four night stay in a hotel in @entity146 , following a £ 313 train journey from @entity148			0
the new head of the health service , @entity149 , has now announced a clampdown on lavish spending and a ban on first - class travel , telling staff at @entity17 to ' think like a patient and act like a taxpayer '			1
@entity159 , chief executive of the @entity105 ’ @entity158 , said : ' it is an absolute disgrace when patients are waiting longer for care , when frontline staff are so overloaded , and when there are such difficulties in some parts of the service , to see this scale of excess at the top of the organisation			0
' @entity173 , from charity @entity174 , added : ' it ’s ludicrous for the organisers of the @entity5 to live a lavish lifestyle while trying to persuade the rest of the health service to save billions on providing care to patients			1
it really is an outrage that these sorts of sums have been diverted from the taxpayer , when they were intended for patient care			0
