by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is confident he can re-launch his career under @entity4 after announcing his return to @entity6 in style			1
the 21 - year - old , who joined @entity9 from @entity6 in a £ 15million switch in january last year , headed back to @entity11 on loan last week having made only a handful of appearances for his new club			1
he was introduced as a 70th - minute substitute at @entity17 and was to have the final say in a dramatic conclusion to an eventful 3 - 3 draw as he demonstrated the talent which attracted @entity9 in a thrilling cameo			1
' he 's let us get on with it and told me to do what i do			0
he 's seen me play before , so he allowed me to go out there and express myself			0
' i have n't really played too much , so coming off the bench i do n't mind because i 'm getting my fitness back			2
but i 'm definitely looking forward to starting a few games			0
' i had to make the move here because i was n't getting minutes on the pitch , so coming back here will definitely push my career forward			2
' @entity30 's strike came five minutes into seven minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game and after he had seen an earlier effort correctly ruled out for offside and been denied twice by @entity52 keeper @entity51			1
he said : ' to be honest , i 'd missed way too many chances before that , so i 'm buzzing to get the goal			0
high five : @entity6 manager @entity4 ( second left ) congratulates scoring substitute @entity2 ' since i came back , i 've been comfortable and everyone has shown me love around the place			1
all i need to do is get settled again and get playing			0
it 's always great to play and i feel at home doing that here with players i 've played with before			0
' i go back home and my dad gives me advice and what i have to do in the next game , so i 'm comfortable and i 'm happy			0
' if @entity30 claimed the headlines on the pitch , @entity4 did so off it as his second spell in charge unfolded in topsy - turvy fashion			1
@entity6 were ahead within 30 seconds when @entity51 could only turn @entity74 's shot on to the post and @entity76 slammed the rebound into the roof of the net			2
it took @entity29 , who had failed too register in either of their opening two @entity84 fixtures , until the 38th minute to break their duck when full - back @entity87 bundled home from close range with the help of a series of ricochets and a deflection off @entity95			1
hugs all round : @entity97 ( left ) embraces goalscorer @entity2 ( right ) who came off the bench to score however , having started the first half dozily , @entity101 's men were guilty of the same offence in the second , allowing @entity104 time and space to tee up @entity107 's pass before volleying it across @entity109 and into the far corner			1
minutes after @entity4 had turned to @entity111 , @entity101 handed 18 - year - old @entity112 his chance , and the @entity115 - born midfielder very nearly won the game for the home side			1
his 74th - minute back - post header after @entity121 's corner had flicked off defender @entity97 restored parity , and when his curling 89th minute shot came back off the post , @entity123 supplied the final touch to claim his first goal in more than five years			2
that should have been enough to claim a first league victory of the campaign , but a lack of discipline and concentration handed @entity30 his chance , and he took it with aplomb			2
@entity101 , who has himself considered @entity30 as a potential signing in the recent past , was understandably disappointed at the result , but confident for what lies ahead			0
he said : ' i think we have got a good group			0
i think we have still got things to do going forward			0
' i think against the better teams , we are probably well set , but we need to find ways through - maybe that bottom half of the @entity84 is where we are going to have to be a bit more patient and show a bit more quality			0
