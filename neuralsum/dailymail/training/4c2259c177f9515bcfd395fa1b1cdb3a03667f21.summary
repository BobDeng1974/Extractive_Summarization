scientists have discovered a brand new species of dinosaur with a nose so big it 's right there in its name			1
@entity6 , or ' @entity7 , ' was discovered in @entity8 back in the 1990s , but scientists never pieced its skull together			1
the skull was stored and forgotten at @entity12 until recently , when researchers from @entity14 and @entity15 of @entity16 put it together and realized its something brand new			1
it 's the first dinosaur of the hadrosaur type -- duck - billed dinos more often known for their large head ornaments than super schnozes , ever found in the area			2
' we â€™ve found other hadrosaurs from the same time period but located about 200 miles farther south that are adapted to a different environment , ' researcher @entity47 from @entity14 told @entity48			0
weighing in at a massive 8,500 pounds and measuring around 30 feet long , the swamp - dwelling beast had one of the biggest body - to - nose ratios of any dinosaur yet discovered			1
so what was the nose used for ? scientists have no idea			0
' the purpose of such a big nose is still a mystery , ' @entity47 said			0
' we are already sniffing out answers to these questions			0
' however , scientists do have a hunch about what brought the beast to its watery end -- a giant crocodile			0
' it seemed like a great possibility that such an attack could have caused the rapid death of a large dinosaur and helped it to be buried quickly by taking it to the bottom of a river , ' @entity47 said			0
@entity77 : @entity6 { ' nose king ' ) was an 8,500 pound herbivore that lived in the swamps of northern @entity8			1
scientists actually discovered it in the 1990s , but did n't piece the schnozzy skull together until recently			2

scientists found the @entity6 in storage at @entity12 in @entity8
the big beaked hadrosaur skull was *unearthed* in the 1990s but had been *unclassified* until recently
@entity89 was 30 feet long and weighed over 8,500 pounds - its nose is one of the largest in the dino kingdom *compared* to its body size
