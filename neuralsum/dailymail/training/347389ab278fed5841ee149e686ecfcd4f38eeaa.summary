how much are you looking forward to it ? @entity2 : more than ever			1
it is my favourite game of the season			2
i enjoy winning at @entity41 , but @entity42 is closer			2
i can feel the hate , the bitterness			0
if there is one ground where i could pick a win , it is @entity24			0
they are great supporters — and i have a lot of respect for them — but for the hell they give me , this is the place			0
@entity3 : i was playing in your first derby			1
you came on as a sub and played at right back			0
my dad said afterwards : ‘ your right back can play			0
’ i said : ‘ wait until you see him play in central midfield , dad ! ’ @entity2 : i felt like a kid invited to a man ’s game			1
i looked like a kid and i played like a kid in many ways			0
when i cleared one off the line , i celebrated like i had scored the winning goal ! being a local lad , i grew up around the derby			2
my dad is a massive red and my mum ’s brother is a massive blue			0
so for years and years , even before i sampled it for myself , i loved the games			0

good news : @entity96 is only just off his crutches ! @entity2 : that tackle was so bad , i could have been sent off twice			1
i went out for dinner that night and who should be in the same restaurant ? @entity96			0
he was a big unit and i would n’t fancy a one - on - one with him off the pitch			2
he put his arm around me , he was great , but my emotion got the better of me in that game			0
that ’s the key to derby games ; do n’t play with your fire			2
it will start at a ferocious pace , the tackles will be flying			0

now and in the future			2
@entity2 : @entity11 need to sign up @entity135 now			1
when i was coming through , once i had a couple of years remaining , my contract would be renewed to avoid the worry			0
i see @entity138 with a year left and @entity135 ’s ( contract situation ) in the paper too much and i know there is no smoke without fire			1
my message to the club is : get these done			0

he ’s got a bit of @entity151 about him			1
@entity2 : he ’s got everything			1
he ’s got a bit of @entity151 and @entity135 rolled into one and if he keeps listening to the right people , he will be one for @entity170			1

i played for @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 ( among others ) and i have notes of tactics and formations , but i need to see for myself too			0
it kills me to think i ’m going to move away from all this , but i am excited about the challenges ahead , even if i feel a little sad too			0
@entity3 : and you can lower your golf handicap			2
@entity2 : i do n’t want anyone in @entity208 to think i am going to take it easy			2
i want to start games , score goals			0
