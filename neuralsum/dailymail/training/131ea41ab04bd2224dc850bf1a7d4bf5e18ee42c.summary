by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ samcunningham the vultures who have been circling @entity4 finally descended this summer and tore great chunks out of the club			1
@entity7 have had the biggest feed , devouring their heart , @entity10 , and the guts , @entity12			1
on sunday , they went for the spine with @entity14 completing his £ 20million move to @entity16			1
@entity17 ripped out the most tender part of all in young full back @entity19			1
@entity21 took off with the brain ; their manager @entity23			1
but what ’s left of a club who , in just four seasons , rose from @entity47 to an eighth - place finish in the @entity49 ? a side who in their first campaign back in the top flight were described as the best to play at @entity54 , by sir @entity55			1
since former executive chairman @entity57 quit in january after a dispute with owner @entity59 , there has been a complete overhaul at the top			0
new manager @entity62 insists he was aware of the situation after meeting their head of football development @entity66			2
‘ the first meeting with @entity66 was open and the information was clear about the squad , ’ said @entity62			2
‘ i knew @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity19 would go			1
i had no influence on that			0
the most important message i gave is that we will keep the philosophy and ambition of the club			2
’ plenty to shout about : @entity4 centre - back @entity14 is on the brink of a £ 20million switch to @entity7 @entity82 's a done deal for @entity7 soon to be rivals ? @entity41 is moving to @entity40 while @entity42 is wanted by @entity21 in their first game last season , a 1 - 0 win at @entity86 ( aug 17 ) , @entity4 ’ starting @entity87 included @entity91 , @entity14 , @entity92 , @entity19 , @entity42 , @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity93			1
all have left or been linked with moves			2
team : @entity96 ; @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity14 , @entity19 ; @entity10 , @entity42 , @entity97 , @entity98 ; @entity12 , @entity93			1
the problem is , those who work closely with @entity4 say that the philosophy has altered			2
one source said : ‘ under @entity57 it was very much like @entity104 or @entity105 , where it does n’t matter who the head coach is it ’s just that you do right by the club			0
’ in march , @entity59 appointed @entity110 as chairman — a bold move given he had no football experience , though he had just led @entity114 to ice hockey gold at the @entity116			0
his complete absence from @entity4 in the past six weeks , during such a crucial period , has not gone unnoticed by staff even though he has been keeping in touch by telephone			2
critics argue that @entity59 and @entity110 know nothing about football and @entity66 is out of his depth			0
‘ getting @entity59 to stabilise the club after @entity57 left is like getting a lunatic to run an asylum , ’ said a source who has worked with a number of top - flight clubs			1
promises that @entity66 made to the fans in april have already been shattered			0
‘ we want to retain the players we ’ve got , ’ he said			0
‘ i think our fans deserve to understand that there is not going to be a fire sale here			0
’ three months later their four best players have gone or are about to go with others set to follow			0
@entity142 , who played for @entity4 for 16 years , suggests losing key figures around the club is nothing new			1
‘ when you ’re a club of our size after the season we had there ’s always a chance vultures will nick our best players , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’ve had to live with that , we ’ve generally sold our most talented boys that came through our system			0
that ’s the way it is			0
’ bad boy : @entity162 are keen on signing @entity163 who joined the @entity4 from @entity165 last summer on target : frontman @entity93 has at least been offered a new deal to ward off any potential suitors adamant : @entity57 believes @entity4 's star men would have stayed had he remained in charge but another @entity4 legend @entity172 is upset			1
‘ i do n’t know when this is going to stop , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s sad to see a side which was only going to get better being broken up			0
it ’s getting beyond a joke			0
it ’s the fans i feel for			0
’ it is understood the majority of funds made from sales — £ 27m for @entity19 , £ 25m for @entity10 , £ 4m for @entity12 and £ 20m for @entity14 — will be spent on recruitment			1
they are looking to sign six players in total for around £ 10m each rather than three at £ 20m			2
they have already signed @entity24 from @entity187 for £ 10.9m to replace @entity10 and spent £ 8m on @entity188 ’s @entity26 for @entity12			1
they will stick with their policy of bringing through players from their highly successful academy			0
for instance , 18 - year - old @entity194 is seen as the long - term replacement for @entity19			2
‘ when we start the season we will have a very good team , ’ @entity62 insisted			1
‘ we will bring in players with even better qualities			0
’ but promises have already been broken and some are tipping @entity4 for relegation			2
indeed , the club ’s future could well be decided by the time the transfer window shuts at the end of next month			0
tough task : new manager @entity62 must essentially build a @entity4 first team from scratch floored : new @entity4 striker @entity26 looks on during the @entity4 ' friendly win over @entity213 making plans : @entity62 and new wideman @entity24 chat on the training field in @entity217			1
