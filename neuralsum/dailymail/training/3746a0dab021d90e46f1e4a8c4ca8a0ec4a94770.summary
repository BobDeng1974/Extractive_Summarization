@entity0 has revealed an ambitious project to develop a pill that would test for cancer and other illnesses			1
it would contain microscopic particles - nanoparticles - which can travel through the bloodstream and search for early signs of disease			1
the tech giant hopes the system will one day allow cancer , heart disease and other diseases to be diagnosed and treated far earlier than they are today			1
it says that nanoparticles could be combined with a wearable sensor to ' sniff ' out and attach themselves to diseased cells - which could then be monitored using a handheld sensor nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream			1
they would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell			0
this would be done by ' painting ' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells			0
they 'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream			2
the core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic , so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it , where they could be detected and counted			1
experts at @entity0 are studying various non-invasive techniques , like light and radio waves , for detecting and counting the particles			2
the technology is being developed at @entity0 's @entity55 , where work is also underway on smart contact lenses to monitor diabetes and special cutlery to eliminate the tremors of patients			1
' much of the improvement in cancer survival rates over the last 30 years is due to earlier detection , like skin cancer screening and pap smears , ' @entity0 said			1
' yet for many serious diseases , there still are n't good enough diagnostics to help doctors catch them in their earliest stages , when they 're most treatable			2
' pancreatic cancer is famously elusive , with only three per cent of cases found in the first , most curable stage			0
and some lung cancer tumours are so aggressive that they even kill people who go for annual @entity78 screening , growing deadly in less than 12 months			0
' @entity0 's engineers hope to harness the chemical signals given off by cells as they become diseased			1
' we wondered : could continuous measurement of subtle changes in the chemistry of the blood be a way to detect a disease very early , when it 's most treatable ? ' the idea is that a patient would swallow a pill containing the microscopic particles , which travel through their bloodstream , searching for malignant cells			1
the particles would then report their findings to a sensor device that is worn on the body			0
@entity0 said the microscopic particles could be magnetised and coated with antibodies that bind with specific proteins or cells associated with various diseases			1
a wearable sensor would track the particles ' magnetic fields			0
@entity0 said : ' although we 're still in the early stages of scientific exploration , we can imagine many different applications of this technology			1
' maybe there could be a test for the enzymes given off by arterial plaques that are about to rupture and cause a heart attack or stroke			0
a @entity0 smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with @entity122 pharmaceutical company @entity121			0
it works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears , before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition			0
' perhaps someone could develop a diagnostic for post-surgery or post-chemo cancer patients – that 's a lot of anxious people right there			2
@entity0 said it has already started work on the project , and plans to license the technology to medical firms to develop the finished tests			1
the project was inspired by a @entity0 engineer			1
two years ago , @entity0 software engineer @entity147 was hit by a car while riding his bicycle			2
' he has no memory of the accident , but he 'll never forget this : in the hospital emergency room , a doctor told him that his medical scans , intended to check for internal bleeding , had revealed a tumor in his kidney , ' the firm said			0
renal cancer typically has few if any symptoms until it 's too late			0
thanks to this unlikely early diagnosis , @entity147 had surgery to remove the tumor and is now cancer free			0
he 's now a member of the @entity170 team and inspired them to pursue this project			2
' we 've run many promising experiments around four core components of a nanodiagnostics platform – designing nanoparticles , binding them to target cells , detecting them with a non-invasive device , and counting them			0
' it could take years to reveal the potential of this technology – nature is a formidable foe – but we hope it 's less than a decade , given what 's at stake			0

@entity0 's @entity55 is developing a pill to test for anver and other diseases
it would contain magnetic nanoparticles that travel trough the bloodstream and search for early signs of disease , before being detected by a wearable
technology would allow cancer , heart disease patients to be diagnosed and treated far earlier that they are today , @entity0 says
the project was inspired by engineer who was *knocked* off his bike - and doctors *spotted* a tumour while treating him
