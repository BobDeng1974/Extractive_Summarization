these colourful photographs may look like works of modern art , but they are really actually close - ups of chemical reactions			1
they show reactions taking place after acid is dripped onto a flower , or when a copper sulphate solution was mixed with sodium hydroxide , to create copper sulphate precipitate , which looks like a brilliantly blue swimming pool			2
the images showcase the dazzling array of colours and textures created when chemicals clash			1

this image shows purple cabbage being dipped into hydrochloric acid			0
the acid solution causes the cabbage to change colour from purple to red the images were created by a group of scientists from the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) in @entity32 , @entity33			1
titled ' @entity35 , ' the project is the brainchild of @entity37 , an associate professor at the university			1
professor @entity37 became fascinated by chemical reactions during his studies and joined with two other professors at @entity31 in february to share their love of colourful potions by taking photographs			1

this photo shows basic copper sulphate precipitate ( blue ) which was formed after copper sulphate solution was added to a solution of sodium hydroxide professor @entity37 became fascinated by chemical reactions during his studies and joined with two other professors at @entity31 in february to share their love of colourful potions by taking photographs			2
this ' wishbone ' flower had sodium hydroxide solution dropped onto its petals , which made them change colour from purple to yellow with help from @entity66 and visual effects experts , professor @entity37 , professor @entity68 and dr @entity64 - researched which reactions would look the most eye - catching on camera			1
this was one of the reactions they chose - the formation of ice blue copper sulphate crystals with help from @entity66 and visual effects experts , professor @entity37 , professor @entity68 and dr @entity64 researched which reactions would look the most eye - catching on camera			1
the scientists then carried out small - scale experiments before shooting the best possible images of the prettiest reactions			1
the trio upload the work to their website - including reactions such as precipitation , crystallisation , bubbling and metal displacement – where they proved popular			0

this photo shows cobalt chloride crystals growing in a solution of sodium silicate , which includes compounds used in drain cleaner the trio of scientists have documented colourful reactions including including precipitation , crystallisation , bubbling and metal displacement			0
this reaction was made when nickel hydroxide precipitate ( the green liquid ) formed after nickel sulphate was added to a solution of sodium hydroxide professor @entity37 said : ‘ i was always fascinated by the beauty of chemistry - both the colourful chemical reactions and the invisible molecular structures			2
’ he shot reactions such as this one - silver chloride precipitate ( white ) which formed after silver nitrate was added to a solution of sodium chloride professor @entity37 , avoids working with reactions that could potentially be hazardous			0
‘ i was always fascinated by the beauty of chemistry - both the colourful chemical reactions and the invisible molecular structures , ’ he said			0
‘ the first step was doing research and selecting the potential reactions that could be beautiful then we conducted experiments and make sure these reactions were indeed worth filming			0
this photo may look like a strange underwater scene , or even an alien landscape , but it is zinc reacting with copper sulphate solution to form red copper			0
the sulphate solution is used so much by the scientists because of its beautiful blue colour this image shows an eggshell reacting with hydrochloric acid to produce carbon dioxide bubbles , which cling to the shell professor @entity37 said : ' during experiments , something unexpected could happen and we ended up getting some extra beautiful shots			0
’ this is one of them			0
it shows purple cabbage being dipped into sodium hydroxide solution , which causes it to change colour ‘ once we found the proper reactions , the third step was to optimise both the reaction parameters and our shooting techniques and make sure we get the perfect images			2
‘ however , during experiments , something unexpected could happen and we ended up getting some extra beautiful shots			0
’ the experts chose which reactions they wanted to record carefully , making sure that they would appear as eye - catching as possible , using specialist equipment			1
here , green fluorescent droplets are formed by mixing the chemicals inside a glow stick this image may look like an egg attack , associated with trick - or - treaters at @entity173			0
but in fact , it shows cadmium sulphide precipitate ( in yellow ) being made after cadmium nitrate was added to a solution of sodium sulphide			0
