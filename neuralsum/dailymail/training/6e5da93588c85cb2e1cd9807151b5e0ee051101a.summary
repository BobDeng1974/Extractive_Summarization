by @entity0 published : 02:14 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 1 june 2012 when the @entity5 sensor , which gives @entity7 's gaming console the ability to ' see ' you and respond to your body movements was launched , the thing that took everyone by surprise was what could be done with it outside of gaming			1
one of the latest projects spawned by enthusiasts brings science - fiction - like holograms to the masses - using nothing more than a dslr camera , which have reduced in price over the last few years to become affordable to the masses , and a @entity5			2
the @entity23 uses the raw , high - definition footage of a dslr camera and maps it against the 3d space that the @entity5 can see , bringing , as the video below shows , a hologram effect from equipment which can be found in many households			1
the technology mixes the images from a dslr camera with an @entity5 sensor to create holograms the @entity5 sensor is able to detect a view in @entity40 , and then software maps the images to create a hologram the @entity43 was designed by @entity44 , @entity45 and photographer @entity46 at the the @entity47 in @entity48			2
the team has now released the software and instructions on the project website to allow people to try this at home			0
while the @entity5 was primarily released for gaming , @entity7 suddenly found themselves with a surprise hit - one of the fastest - selling gadgets in history - when enthusiasts and programmers realised they could hook it up to a computer and push a new frontier in technology			1
@entity7 quickly cottoned on to the side potentials of the device and released drivers for @entity69 , allowing programmers to jump onboard			0
from space agencies strapping the sensors onto satellites , to movie fans giving their televisions a unique , body - controlled remote control , the humble game controller accidentally gave people a glimpse of the future			0
multi-track : the technology can pick up more than one person at a time the technology can also be used to landscape rooms and other vistas the equipment : a standard dslr , available in most electronics shops for around Â£ 400 , can be used to produce the images see video here :			0

@entity7 's body - tracking sensor takes on life of its own as enthusiasts take to new technology
hooking up a *digital* camera allows users to film **holographic** videos or make **holographic** phone - calls
@entity23 release software *online* for other @entity5 *owners* to play with
