rapper @entity0 has been revealed as the most prolific celebrity user of photo sharing app @entity2			1
according to data compiled by addiction website addiction - @entity5 , the 43 - year - old has posted more images than any other famous person currently using the app , including selfie queens @entity11 and @entity12			1
but @entity0 - whose real name is @entity0 , @entity14 - was also revealed to have posted more references to drugs and alcohol than any other celebrity , with fellow rapper @entity19 coming a close second			1
indeed , it seems rappers in general have a particular fondness for the photo sharing ; of the 40 celebrities included on the list of most active users , a whopping 27 were rappers , while just six actors or actresses , four models and three comedians were also included			2
but when ranked according to number of illicit images shared on the site , rappers , including @entity59 and @entity60 , made up the top 15 spots on the list			0
setting an example for his fellow rappers however , is @entity66 , who has posted just one image which contained surprisingly , the @entity11 clan , who are renowned for their seemingly - constant @entity2 updates , featured fairly far down on the list , with @entity71 , @entity11 and their younger sister @entity74 placing ninth , tenth and eleventh respectively			1
illicit images : the website also revealed which celebrities post the most references to drugs and alcohol risky rappers : of all the users revealed to have posted the most illicit images , the majority were rappers but when it came to the more illicit @entity2 updates , the reality stars will no doubt be happy to hear that they fell even further down the list			1
according to @entity92 , both @entity11 and @entity71 have posted a total of 21 photos which contained references to drugs or alcohol , while @entity74 - who is only 19 and therefore not yet legal to drink in the @entity97 - has posted ten			1
the data does show that the number of celebrities posting images which contain references to drugs - and the frequency with which they have posted them - has decreased significantly since 2011 , when the site became available to all members of the public			0
however the number of images containing references to alcohol has increased substantially			0
' we can see the growth and decline of celebrity @entity2 shares of drugs and alcohol images each month since 2011 , ' the website states			2
strike a pose : surprisingly selfie queens @entity11 ( @entity122 ) and @entity123 ( r ) featured fairly far down on the list the perfect pout : @entity74 also featured on the list , just below her older sisters ' it ’s clear that sharing drugs has decreased significantly as the social media platform has become more prominent , but sharing alcohol posts has risen as the site ’s popularity has surged			2
' the website also questions whether celebrities ' eagerness to post such mature content is having a direct impact on the number of their fans who turn to drinking and drug use in an attempt to follow in their famous idols ' footsteps			0
' as @entity2 has grown more popular , so has its popularity with celebrities , some of whom use social media to candidly and directly interact with fans , ' the website explains			0
' when drug use comes into the equation , we have to wonder what kind of message is being sent			0
are celebrities promoting drug and alcohol abuse ? if @entity0 ’s lighting up right now , why do n’t i ? '			0
