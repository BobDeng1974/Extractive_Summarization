with the transfer window firmly closed until january , @entity1 clubs up and down the land have a few months to reflect on their summer business			1
but which sides had a window to remember ? who surprised their rivals with some wise acquisitions ? and which players who chose to go elsewhere would 've been the biggest asset to @entity13 's top - flight ? we asked our three wise men - @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - those questions and more			1
here 's what they had to say			0
they got most of their business done early and always seemed to be in control			0
the way @entity23 has started is so impressive and we 've still not seen @entity43 , who is a top player			1
and the money they 've spent is not too bad when you compare it to @entity29			1
perfect start : @entity23 has bagged four goals already after joining @entity35 from @entity50 @entity18 : @entity35 did their business early and got £ 50million for @entity52			1
further down the table , @entity53 did well to keep @entity55			0
and i really want @entity57 to do well			0
he 's been a scapegoat for too long			0
new and old : @entity59 ( left ) is pulling the strings in @entity35 's midfield while @entity62 ( right ) has returned to the club to provide experience @entity17 : it 's a full house			1
@entity35 won it the day they sold @entity52 for £ 50m			1
and then they got £ 28m for @entity67			0
financial fair play rules have made them become better negotiators			0
reasons to smile : @entity35 boss @entity72 ( right ) finds his side on top of the @entity1 table is @entity24 good business for @entity77 ? @entity78 : it is good business			1
@entity29 are becoming a team of galacticos and he does n’t fit into that			1
i ’m not sure @entity29 have ever been convinced about him			2
it will be exciting for him to work with @entity89			0
he improves young players and has a superb record with top strikers : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			2
@entity24 is not clinical in front of goal but he ’ll practise that			2
i remember @entity100 rarely hitting the target when he first joined @entity77 but @entity89 had him practising and the improvement was phenomental			1
he ’s the same price as @entity104 but @entity24 will be here for the long term , @entity104 wo n’t			2
my only worry is that he could be in mourning about leaving such a great club			2
he needs to realise he has joined another and can finally take centre stage			0
fresh start : @entity24 left @entity29 to join @entity77 in a £ 16million deal on transfer deadline day @entity16 : i can see the positives of his move from both sides			1
his goalscoring record is n’t great so i can see why @entity29 have moved him on			1
a lot of people at @entity29 will be loath to see a local lad go			2
and he has real pace , which @entity29 do n’t have much of			2
he ’s a good fit for @entity77 but he ’ll play a similar role : sometimes he ’ll be out wide , sometimes through the middle and sometimes on the bench			2
is he really going to be their @entity132 striker ? @entity133 : i like him and always hear good things about his attitude and personality			0
he ’s a good athlete but does n’t score enough goals and does n’t get in the right positions enough			0
i ’m pleased for @entity77 fans that they signed someone			2
@entity24 is going there with a real point to prove			1
point to prove : @entity24 , pictured in @entity13 training , will be hoping for regular playing time at the @entity149 outside the heavyweights , who got the best deal ? @entity133 : @entity153 signed match - winners in @entity155 and @entity156			1
and i wo n’t apologise for saying it but @entity159 is an excellent signing — he ’s a monster , exactly what @entity162 needed			1
he ’s got a tremendous attitude and work ethic and is an infectious character who will rub off on everyone			0
talented : the signing of @entity169 midfielder @entity156 on loan from @entity171 was a coup for @entity153 @entity78 : @entity153 landing @entity156			1
he was never a bad player , he just fell out with @entity174			0
he has so much ability			0
@entity16 : i agree on @entity159			2
he ’s a big strong player , who impressed me for @entity177			0
he has a physical presence and @entity162 needed @entity1 experience			1
they just have to keep him fit			0
one signing you wish had happened ... @entity16 : i ’d have loved to have seen @entity183 come back to the @entity1 instead of moving to @entity184			1
he ’s such a good passer of the ball			0
i do n’t know why @entity187 did n’t want him			0
instead he went to @entity188			0
he passes the ball so cleanly			0
@entity133 : i agree with @entity18 on @entity183 and would have also liked to have seen @entity77 sign @entity190			1
they are so close to being title contenders			0
moving on : @entity183 ( left ) left @entity188 for @entity184 , while @entity186 ( right ) went the other way @entity195 breaks records across the board			1

the summer transfer window closed on monday night
@entity35 *strengthened* their squad and sold their *unwanted* players
@entity23 has *helped* fire @entity72 's side to the top of the table
@entity24 has a point to prove after leaving @entity29
the 23 - year - old joined @entity77 in a £ 16million deadline day deal
@entity153 have made some *inspired* signings , *including* @entity156 on loan
@entity159 will give @entity162 a strong presence in central midfield
@entity183 and @entity186 would 've been great *additions* to the @entity1 but both moved elsewhere
