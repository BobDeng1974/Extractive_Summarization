did @entity0 lift the work of an independent artist to use in its @entity4 town - takeover campaign ? they did if you ask the clever mind behind a t - shirt of a @entity9			1
at a seemingly similar real life truck , the 90s pop - rapper personally handed out ice cream this past weekend at @entity16 's @entity15 pop - up party town in @entity17			1
artist @entity18 says someone in the @entity16 marketing campaign swiped his design and hired the 90s star to come help drum up publicity , all without paying him a penny			1
similar ? @entity16 's version : here is @entity28 giving out ice cream at the @entity30 in @entity17 , where @entity0 built a pop - up party town over the weekend plagiarism ? here is the graphic artist @entity18 says he created for a t - shirt company before the weekend 's festivities in @entity17 winners and losers ? revelers packed the town of @entity17 for @entity42 , which was a boon for @entity0 , but @entity18 believes he 's lost out on @entity18 's t - shirt , a rendering of @entity28 holds a cartoon cone beside a truck emblazoned with the words ' @entity48			1
' beside it floats the original white pop - rapper 's head			1
on the ' @entity53 ' at this past weekend 's @entity55 party , that same head of @entity28 , or one that looks eerily like it , floats on the side of the vehicle			1
' it ’s pretty clearly exactly what i drew , ' @entity18 told @entity63			2
' i do n’t know if it was by accident or what			0
' @entity18 initially took his frustrations out via social media			2
' no problem , ' the graphic designer tweeted bitterly			0
' feel free to steal my work			0
i 'm sure times are tight for @ @entity73 ' he maintained his bitter tone in a september 7 @entity77 post that has since gone viral			0
' thank you to @entity79 for liking my work ( and idea ) so much they decided to steal it , ' wrote the @entity85 - based artist			2
' why should a little mom and pop company like @entity0 pay artists for their original property ? ' @entity0 has since issued a statement on the matter : ' @entity0 and @entity79 respect the property and creativity of artists , and we ’re looking into the situation ' as has @entity28 himself , in his own way			1
' now i see it , ' @entity28 tweeted , presumably in reference to the similarity between t - shirt and truck			0
' looking @entity107 pimpin , luv your artwork			0
' while @entity18 may have months or years of legal battles ahead , things are n't looking all bad for the graphic designer			0
' on the bright side @entity28 now follows me on twitter , ' @entity18 said			0
bright side : @entity18 would later complain that he was angry about @entity16 's alleged uncredited use of his work , but gush that at least it got @entity28 to follow him on @entity119			2

@entity0 had 90s pop - rapper *manning* a @entity53 at their @entity15 town takeover in @entity17 this weekend
artist @entity18 *contends* the company used his work on the truck and he received no *compensation*
