by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:01 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 20:15 est , 26 february 2013 a senior @entity2 was last night sensationally accused of trying to gag a whistleblower who spoke out over the spiralling sexual harassment scandal engulfing the party			1
on monday night , lord @entity6 made an ‘ aggressive ’ telephone call to a former party activist who had complained she had witnessed the former @entity2 chief executive @entity11 molesting a party member more than a decade ago			1
he was apparently furious that she had contacted the @entity14 to complain that her allegations had been swept under the carpet when she tried to raise the alarm at the time			1
peers : lord @entity6 introduced to the @entity20 ( left ) standing next to @entity11 ( right ) the woman , whose identity we are not revealing , said she had been left deeply upset by the conversation – which suggests that even this week , as the scandal was unfolding , senior party figures were attempting to silence the whistleblowers			1
last night @entity2 president @entity28 said lord @entity6 ’s intervention had been ‘ wholly unacceptable ’ , while sources close to @entity31 said he had been reprimanded by the party ’s chief whip			1
the peer , who was the @entity2 ’ director of operations at the height of the claims against @entity11 , will now be subject to the party ’s two inquiries into the affair			1
senior sources suggested the woman would even be encouraged to contact @entity44 detectives who are assessing the allegations against @entity11			1
the @entity14 has learned that complaints were made to @entity6 , as the party ’s then director of operations , about @entity11 ’s alleged inappropriate behaviour in 2003			1
but lord @entity6 , who was recommended for a peerage by mr @entity31 in 2011 , is accused of failing to investigate the accusations thoroughly			1
after witnessing a young female political researcher upset by @entity11 ’s alleged touching at a hotel during an ‘ away weekend ’ , a senior activist said she went through official channels and reported the incident			2
she complained to @entity6 , who was in charge of all human resource issues			1
the @entity2 are too dodgy - we 're voting for @entity61 the @entity2 member , who is still active in local government , said she approached him in his office and asked if they could discuss @entity11 ’s behaviour			2
lord @entity6 is said to have replied : ‘ that ’s not very clever			1
he [ @entity11 ] has been silly			2
i will speak to him and deal with it			2
’ shortly after the @entity14 put the claims about the 2003 complaints to @entity6 , he rang the female activist while she was putting her children to bed			1
the woman said : ‘ he rang up and said “ i ’m not very happy as i ’ve just had a call from the @entity14 ”			1
he demanded to know why i was speaking to journalists just days before the @entity81 by - election and branded me silly			2
‘ his tone was very harsh and it just took me back to the intimidating atmosphere when i was working in the party ’s headquarters ten years ago			2
i reported it straight away to @entity28 as people should n’t be put off from coming forward			2
‘ i know of two other people who reported the incident to @entity6 at the time and everyone was aware of it			1
but nothing was done and @entity11 was not formally interviewed or disciplined by the party			2
‘ a lot of us who complained were later marginalised and dismissed as ‘ silly girls ’ or ‘ hormonal women ’ by getting upset about the claims and making an issue of it			1
’ last night a senior @entity2 source said mr @entity31 regarded lord @entity6 ’s behaviour as ‘ completely unacceptable ’ and said he had been rebuked by chief whip @entity105			1
the source added : ‘ he has been left under no illusion that that is what people think			2
this is all now going to have to form part of the independent investigations			2
’ mr @entity28 said : ‘ his actions were wholly unacceptable and this conversation will now form part of our independent investigations			0
the party has a duty of care to the alleged victims , and they are my priority – as is the need to ensure that due process is properly followed			0
’ when questioned by the mail , lord @entity6 did not deny that complaints were made to him about @entity11 ’s behaviour in 2003			1
he said : ‘ there is an investigation and i ’m not going to talk about internal party matters to the @entity14			1
’ lord @entity6 ran the party ’s headquarters under leaders @entity132 , @entity133 and mr @entity31			1
he failed three times to get elected to the @entity135			0
minister for women : @entity137 women targeted in the alleged sexual harassment scandal were referred to as ‘ @entity11 ’s red hot babes ’ , a former @entity2 councillor claimed yesterday			0
the woman , who asked to be identified only as ‘ @entity142 ’ , said she and at least nine other women had been on the receiving end of unwanted advances from @entity11 in incidents dating back to 2001			1
in an extraordinary interview , she also said she had confided in a number of senior figures – including @entity150 , a close ally of @entity31 – over the peer ’s conduct			0
it is the first time mr @entity150 , a health minister , has been linked to the affair			0
it means a string of senior @entity2 , including chief secretary to the treasury @entity157 and minister for women @entity137 , are now facing questions about what they knew of the allegations			1
speaking to the @entity165 ’s @entity164 , she said : ‘ @entity137 [ @entity166 ] did the best she could with a bad situation , because at the time , we were all saying , we do n’t want this to go public , we really do n’t want this to go public , we do n’t want to be in the public domain			0
‘ in fact at one point , someone referred to us as “ @entity11 ’s red hot babes ”			0
’ ‘ we did n’t want any of these headlines , ’ she added			0
@entity142 also said it was clear that @entity2 leader @entity31 ‘ did n’t know how to deal with it and then did n’t deal with it well ’			0
she said she had told mr @entity150 , @entity166 and former party president @entity179 about an ‘ extremely distressing ’ encounter with @entity11 at a hotel in 2008 , where he was talking to women activists about how they could become mps			0
after dinner , she said , @entity11 sat next to her			0
she claimed : ‘ at first i thought it was an accident – his leg brushed against me and then his hand brushed against my leg			0
‘ so i moved away a little			0
and then he moved a little closer			0
and i moved away again , and the brushing of my leg kept continuing			0
‘ so i kept moving further away			0
and eventually i said , “ look i ’m going to go off to bed ”			0
and he said “ i ’ll walk up with you ”			0
’ despite her protests , @entity11 walked her upstairs , she claimed , and suggested that she join him in his room for another drink – a suggestion she ‘ very politely and very firmly ’ rejected			0
she said : ‘ of course men do try it on , but this is a man with an almighty amount of power			0
at the time he held the purse strings for any winnable seat			0
