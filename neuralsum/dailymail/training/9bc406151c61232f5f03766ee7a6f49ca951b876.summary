@entity0 put the damp squib of 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by running roughshod over a miserable @entity4 in a manner not properly reflected by the scoreline			1
@entity7 and former toffee @entity8 scored the first - half goals that secured the points although @entity0 ’s star man was their @entity12 forward @entity11 , who dazzled with his best performance of the season at the heart of everything good about the hosts			1
and then there was @entity4 ; poor , sorry , shambolically defensive @entity4 , losing a fourth game on the bounce to leave their campaign beached if not quite mired in a relegation battle			1
they improved from woeful in the first half to mediocre in the second but something is badly awry in @entity26 ’s team and needs fixing , quickly			2
in the calendar year they played 18 home league games and won a pitiful three all year , and one this season			1
their win - draw - loss statistics at the @entity105 were 3 - 4 - 11 , or relegation standard when it is almost inevitably a struggling team ’s home form that keeps them			1
they finished the year with another home reverse , 1 - 0 to @entity112 on sunday , and the dreadful showings at home were a large part of why they started the day hovering above the relegation zone			1
@entity53 had responded to suggestions before the game that he was among candidates for the manager ’s job at @entity123 by saying he was ‘ flattered ’ but ruled himself out			0
‘ i ’m determined to see this through with @entity0 and make sure we stay in the @entity97 , ’ he said			1
@entity7 rises above @entity4 full back @entity75 to head @entity0 in front at the @entity105 on @entity128 @entity7 turns away to celebrate as @entity4 captain gives @entity75 a rueful look after he was beaten in the air @entity0 's @entity7 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after heading @entity53 's side into the lead @entity38 was given his marching orders by referee @entity89 after picking up two second - half yellow cards @entity38 walks off down the tunnel past his manager @entity26 after being dismissed in the 86th minute for a second bookable offence the @entity4 players look dejected as they wait for @entity0 players to return to their positions after the opening goal his first game of a new year duly began with four changes to the starting xi from the @entity112 loss , with @entity56 dropped to the bench after an achilles problem , @entity61 and @entity66 both benched and @entity151 injured			1
in came @entity48 and @entity55 to defence while @entity11 and former @entity4 front man @entity8 both returned , as the pairing up top			1
@entity56 was on the field inside 23 minutes in any case , replacing @entity55 , off with a hamstring pull			0
@entity4 came into the game on the back of three straight league defeats and with just one win in seven in what is easily @entity26 ’s most troubling spell in charge since taking over from @entity163 in the summer of 2013			2
there is a gag that is becoming a common refrain and holds no amusement for @entity4 supporters but it is painful because it is true : @entity26 ’s team is starting to defend like his leaky @entity172 of old			2
five changes from the xi who started in last weekend ’s 3 - 2 defeat to @entity123 included @entity83 dropping to the bench and @entity177 dropping off the radar altogether			2
@entity82 was also benched , along with @entity179 , while @entity180 was injured			0
the quintet coming in - @entity69 , @entity86 , @entity78 , @entity182 and @entity74 - did so into a rare and peculiar 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 that had @entity70 as part of a three - man defensive line with @entity185 and @entity75 on the flanks of a midfield four			1
@entity4 looked the livelier for all of two minutes as @entity72 charged down the right and set up @entity77 , whose cutback found nobody , and then it was pretty much @entity0 for most of the first half			1
@entity0 forward @entity11 put in a man of the match display as the @entity12 dazzled with his best performance if the season @entity4 captain @entity69 has word with goalkeeper @entity196 during @entity4 's fourth consecutive league defeat @entity11 holds off the challenge of @entity4 midfielder @entity70 as the former @entity201 man stumbles to the ground @entity26 holds his arms out as he watches his side concede twice in the first half to fall to another defeat @entity53 ’s men should have had a penalty in the third minute when @entity70 fouled @entity11 , replays confirming it was inside the area			1
instead a free - kick was given on the edge of the box as @entity8 smacked it high and over			1
@entity11 then dispossessed @entity74 and whipped in a shot , forcing @entity31 into a smart pushed save			2
@entity4 had plenty of possesion and did not much with it , @entity78 ’s long - range shot , high , being a case in point			1
the visitors also had a penalty shout when @entity74 was squished by two defenders running towards the area but nothing was given and it was far from conclusive			0
with @entity56 on for @entity55 and @entity11 causing all sorts of distractions , it was a matter of time before @entity0 made their efforts count			2
in the 33rd minute they did , @entity7 outjumping @entity75 to meet @entity56 ’s cross with a header to the bottom right corner			1
@entity0 were close to doubling the lead eight minutes later when @entity56 and @entity11 combined , the latter ’s shot blocked , and did double it shortly afterwards as @entity8 ran onto @entity11 ’s ball over the top and lobbed @entity31			1
@entity26 needed to change something , urgently , and he made a double change at half - time , bringing on £ 28m summer signing @entity79 and @entity73			2
that changed the dynamic of the match , with @entity4 finally creating chances			2
@entity79 had efforts missed and saved , @entity74 was thwarted more than once and @entity76 had a good chance blocked			0
and still @entity0 came back , @entity11 absolutely outstanding and they pushed for more goals on this bright dawn of a new year			2
@entity253 writhes around in agony as the first - half substitute had to leave the field after picking up an injury @entity253 receives attention from medical staff as @entity26 complains to the referee and fourth official afterwards , @entity26 claimed he ‘ loves the pressure ’ as he was forced to bat away concerns that he could be the next @entity97 manager to be sacked			1
@entity26 insisted : ‘ i know my team has quality			0
the reality is we are low on confidence and once the goal goes in , we are a completely different side			0
it ’s a new year , a fresh year and ( we need to ) quickly turns things around			0
’ @entity53 , happy to see the end of a difficult 2014 , said : ‘ it ’s been probably our best performance			0
‘ we ’ve seen glimpses of it but from the first minute to the 90th there was a determination that it was going to be our day			0
’ he was full of praise for @entity11 , whose season has been disrupted by trips to @entity280 for international duty and the birth of his child			0
‘ he ’s found it difficult , ’ @entity53 said			0
‘ we ’ve needed to give him time			0
i think he ’s proved what a good player he can be for us			0
’ @entity53 confirmed he is interested in signing former @entity201 forward @entity286 , 32 , this month			0
‘ you ask any club in the bottom of the division , all of us would say “ yes ” , ’ he added			0
‘ whether we can do it financially is another problem			0
but if he becomes available , which i believe he is , then we ’d love to do something			0

@entity0 edged away from the relegation zone after beating @entity4 at the @entity105 on *thursday*
@entity7 gave @entity0 the lead when he out jumped @entity75 headed home @entity253 's cross
@entity0 doubled their lead 10 minutes later when former @entity4 man @entity8 calmly finished past @entity31
this was @entity4 's fourth consecutive @entity97 defeat and their fifth in six games
