@entity0 last night accused @entity1 of existing in a ‘ parallel universe ’ and ‘ insulting taxpayers ’ last night as @entity5 budget talks collapsed in acrimony			1
in the strongest condemnation of @entity5 institutions ever issued by a @entity10 prime minister , mr @entity0 reacted with scorn after being accused of ‘ blackmailing ’ other leaders by demanding spending cuts and defending @entity10 ’s rebate			1
mr @entity0 said he was astonished that @entity5 bosses were refusing to cut ‘ a single euro ’ from their spending plans – as the two - day summit designed to fix the next seven - year budget deal for the @entity5 broke up without agreement			1
front row left to right , @entity36 prime minister @entity35 , @entity38 's prime minister @entity37 , @entity40 prime minister @entity39 , @entity42 prime minister @entity41 , @entity44 president @entity43 , @entity46 president @entity45 , @entity27 president @entity26 , @entity48 president @entity47 , @entity50 president @entity49 , @entity52 president @entity51 , @entity54 prime minister @entity53 , @entity56 prime minister @entity55 , @entity58 prime minister @entity57			0
back row left to right , @entity60 prime minister @entity59 , @entity62 's prime minister @entity61 , @entity64 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity65 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity66 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity67 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity68 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity69 's prime minister @entity63 , @entity70 @entity63 @entity10 officials were also ‘ surprised ’ @entity5 bosses thought it appropriate to serve leaders with 1992 @entity74 , a red wine costing £ 120 a bottle , as they discussed spending plans.but having made it clear he would veto the budget unless ‘ tens of billions ’ were slashed from it , the prime minister won crucial support from @entity83 ’s @entity82			1
@entity50 , @entity40 , @entity67 and other southern economies who do best out of the budget were horrified at the new alliance between the pair , dubbed ‘ @entity90 ’ or ‘ @entity91 ’ by angry @entity5 officials			1
the prime minister deserves great credit for trying to force the spendthrift @entity5 elite to join the real world , in which national budgets are being slashed and household incomes ruthlessly squeezed			2
we also applaud mr @entity0 for recruiting @entity83 as a powerful ally in resisting a budget deal that would have done nothing to slim down the grotesquely bloated @entity1 bureaucracy			1
a note of caution , however : the arrogant , self - serving , and unaccountable @entity5 elite rarely takes no for an answer			1
the pm will need to be every bit as determined when they come calling with an updated but doubtless equally ludicrous list of budget demands early next year			0
the two - day summit was deadlocked by a split between northern countries who put more into the @entity5 budget than they get out , including @entity10 , @entity83 , the @entity58 and @entity68 – and those who are net recipients , such as @entity67 and @entity40			1
@entity50 president @entity49 , who opposed any cuts in the @entity119 of farm subsidies , which hugely benefits his country , insisted he would not agree to any cut in the @entity5 budget			1
as he left @entity1 last night , mr @entity0 said those countries who , like @entity10 , ‘ write the cheques ’ were entitled to block the deal being put forward by @entity27 president @entity26			2
‘ we ’re not going to be tough on budgets at home just to come here and sign up to big increases in @entity134 spending , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ we need to cut unaffordable spending – that ’s what ’s happening at home , that ’s what needs to happen here			0
’ setting out a range of areas where the budget could be slashed in a way that ‘ would not result in hardship for any member states ’ , he suggested a cut in the @entity5 ’s justice and security budget , and was scathing about the @entity52 ’s refusal to countenance any reduction in the pay and perks of 40,000 @entity155			1
he said the @entity5 ’s administration budget of 56billion euros should be cut by ten billion , but @entity5 bosses instead wanted to increase it to 63billion euros			1
the prime minister said 200 @entity5 officials were paid more than him , adding that @entity10 has had to cut administration budgets in @entity162 departments by a third			2
‘ @entity1 continues to exist as if it is in a parallel universe , ’ he said			0
@entity165 premier @entity74 is a red @entity167 blend loved by wine connoisseurs – and even the less outstanding 1992 vintage which @entity5 leaders were served still costs £ 120 a bottle			2
the wine was given a valuable boost when it was drunk by @entity175 ’s @entity174 in the film @entity177			0
the 1992 vintage is considered one of its ‘ least successful ’ years but , according to one reviewer , was still ‘ eminently drinkable ’			0
experts recommended the 1992 should have been drunk at least four years ago			0
in the film , @entity174 drank the 1982 vintage which costs at least £ 220 a bottle			0
as one - to - one negotiations between individual @entity5 leaders and @entity27 president @entity26 dragged on for hours longer than scheduled on thursday , mr @entity0 got so fed up that he sloped off for lunch at a nearby @entity66 brasserie and dinner at a fish restaurant			1
‘ @entity5 institutions simply have to adjust to the real world			2
last night the @entity52 did n’t offer a single euro in savings – not one euro – insulting @entity134 taxpayers			0
‘ who is there to stand up for the taxpayer ? which institution in @entity134 is there to say “ where is the money going to come from , who is going to pay for this ? ” he insisted the budget rebate negotiated by @entity206 , worth £ 3.2billion last year , remained ‘ completely justified ’ despite demands by other @entity5 leaders it be scaled back			1
he also vowed to continue to defend it in future negotiations , with another budget summit expected in february			0
@entity10 officials were privately scathing about the refusal of mr @entity26 to offer a better deal , with one saying the president had ‘ f * * * * * it up ’			0
mr @entity0 insisted it was still possible to salvage a deal at a future summit , but again suggested the @entity10 people would have to be asked to give ‘ fresh consent ’ for a renegotiated relationship with @entity1			2
@entity52 president @entity51 said : ‘ we want of course efficiency gains			0
by efficiency gains i mean reducing costs that are avoidable but not necessarily cutting the capacity of the @entity134 institutions to act			0
the reality is the @entity5 budget is small , only around 2 per cent of total public expenditure in the @entity5			2
’ @entity233 , president of the @entity235 and @entity236 group in the @entity44 , to which @entity238 @entity237 belong , said the summit had been ‘ disastrous ’ and blamed mr @entity0			2
mr @entity0 ’s stance was welcomed by @entity243 @entity242 @entity241 , who said the prime minister ‘ has done as much as anyone reasonably could ’			0
@entity83 chancellor @entity82 was driven through rain to arrive at day two of the budget talks , with hopes of a deal fading the prime minister warned other @entity5 leaders to stop ' tinkering ' with @entity134 's budget @entity5 president @entity26 arrived at the summit day , struggling to meet the conflicting demands of all 27 countries , with @entity50 president @entity49 demanding increases in subsidies for farmers a long night ahead : @entity0 , @entity83 chancellor @entity82 and @entity58 prime minister @entity57 take a break from talks last night with a deal still a long way off video : @entity0 says big cuts need to be made as he begins @entity5 summit in @entity1			1

summit aimed at agreeing spending for 2014 - 2020 *dramatically* called off
@entity0 warned too many countries were only willing to ' tinker ' with the @entity5 's vast budget
@entity63 demanded *proposals* to slash pay and *pensions* of the 40,000 - strong @entity277 workforce
@entity5 bosses were said to have reacted ' very *defensively* ' to suggestions
@entity83 chancellor @entity82 has ' doubts ' about reaching agreement
