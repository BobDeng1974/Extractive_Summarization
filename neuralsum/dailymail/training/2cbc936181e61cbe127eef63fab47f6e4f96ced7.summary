close - up : although @entity1 and @entity2 endured a stormy relationship during their first film @entity6 , a new biography has claimed they would disappear inside his trailer together when making @entity10 in 1987 with that permanent grin , quizzical eyebrow and wicked gleam in his eye , @entity2 has famously seduced scores of glamorous women , amply living up to the ‘ horny little devil ’ he played in @entity18			1
but the serene @entity1 , @entity19 ’s sweetheart , was never assumed to be one of them			1
they had endured a notably stormy relationship on their first film together , heartburn			0
so — as a new biography claims — there was some surprise among fellow cast and crew of their second movie , the 1987 drama @entity10 , when @entity1 , then aged 37 , disappeared into @entity2 ’s @entity35 trailer for long @entity36 with her 50 - year - old co-star			1
according to biographer @entity39 , the pair were n’t discussing the script			1
he claims the trailer would rock around with such energy that it seemed to be balanced on thin springs — ‘ four overworked @entity47 ’ , as one alleged witness put it , referring to the popular children ’s spring toy			0
‘ whatever is going on inside that @entity35 , it ’s starting to get out of hand , to the point where it ’s embarrassing a lot of people on the set , ’ grumbled a film insider , we are told			1
but how true are these claims ? @entity1 had been married to sculptor @entity61 since 1978 , and she denied allegations of an affair at the time			1
@entity2 was in an on - off relationship with actress @entity65 and was also secretly seeing the @entity67 - born actress @entity66 , says biographer @entity39			1
ironweed , in which the couple played a homeless couple in the @entity71 , was filmed over 17 weeks in @entity72 in @entity73			0
‘ as soon as it began , rumours exploded like wild mushrooms that something was going on between @entity2 and his co-star , @entity1 “ i ’ll - never - work - with - him - again ” @entity1 , ’ says @entity39			1
‘ there had been talk that the two had grown unusually close , but both denied it			0
’ but @entity2 ’s alleged tryst with @entity1 is not the only shocking claim in the new biography of the famously hard - living superstar which details a drug use that was almost as compulsive as his womanising			1
@entity19 insider @entity39 ’s book , @entity2 : a biography , which came out in the @entity93 yesterday , would be enough to sink a dozen other @entity19 careers in a tsunami of embarrassment , but one can only imagine it will simply widen the cheeky grin on the famously shameless star ’s face			1
on screen : in the 1987 film @entity1 , then aged 37 , and @entity2 , who was 50 , played vagrants in depression era @entity93 denial : @entity1 , pictured with @entity2 and @entity106 in 2010 , denied allegations of an affair during filming of @entity10 , in which the pair played a homeless couple @entity2 , 76 , is now into his fifth decade at the top of the @entity19 tree , and has a record 12 @entity117 nominations ( he ’s won three ) under his nowadays rather strained belt			1
but as @entity39 details , the child of a poor @entity121 family worked hard for his success			1
and he played hard , too			0
even before he was famous , the parties that @entity2 would throw — the sex , drinks and drugs — were well - known in @entity128			1
at what was dubbed the ‘ wildest house in @entity19 ’ , @entity2 presided over ‘ round - the - clock partying , drinks , drugs , sex			1
and beautiful , hot , willing girls who loved to get just as high as the boys and have a good time , ’ writes @entity39			1
the refrigerator never had any food in it , just milk — for @entity2 ’s sensitive stomach — and beer , with cannabis in the freezer to keep it fresh			1
@entity145 , an old crony of @entity2 and another hard partier , says he always remembers his friend in those days with ‘ cheap red wine on his lips ’ — permanently tipsy and ‘ ready to offer any comfort he could to whatever woman needed it ’			1
actress @entity155 was @entity2 ’s first and only wife from 1962 to 1968			2
but it was his introduction to @entity158 , the hallucinogen that powered so many @entity160 songs and which was , in @entity2 ’s @entity19 , prescribed by some psychiatrists , that had possibly the greater impact on his life			2
history : @entity2 reputedly slept with 2,000 women ( he modestly insists he never counted ) , but the one that lasted the longest - 17 years - was @entity65 , who he was pictured with here in 1976 he told friends that after taking it for the first time , he had seen the face of @entity173 and the drug also gave him castration and homoerotic fear fantasies , as well as revelations about having been an unloved child			1
yet @entity2 continued to take @entity158 for years , along with marijuana and , later , cocaine			2
the last of these drugs apparently helped with @entity2 ’s secret failing — a severe drawback for a lothario — premature ejaculation			2
@entity2 ’s acting career is now so feted that it is hard to believe that it took him some time to establish himself in @entity19 and , in despair at the lack of work , even switched at one point to screenwriting			1
revelations : @entity19 insider @entity39 's book , @entity2 : a biography , came out in the @entity93 yesterday but even if the acting roles took time coming , his charisma made him a permanent presence at parties			1
whether it was @entity202 and his wife hosting , or @entity204 and her film director boyfriend @entity205 , @entity2 would be there , holding court and keeping everyone entertained with his amazing stories			2
only one person outdid @entity2 in the hedonism stakes			2
@entity145 would throw weekend sex parties , gathering the ‘ hottest starlets and all the available young men , some single and some not , who wanted to get whacked out and share beds with these naked , luscious , beautiful women ’			0
but @entity2 would usually shut himself away in his bedroom , tapping out screenplays furiously on his typewriter			2
it was in 1969 that @entity2 broke into the big time after he appeared in the cult drugs culture film @entity225			1
recruited largely because the director believed the affable @entity2 would keep co-stars @entity227 and @entity229 from fighting , @entity2 was stoned almost the whole time ( he reportedly smoked 155 joints during the time it took to film just one key scene )			1
stardom quickly engulfed @entity2 in the @entity237 with a succession of acclaimed films including @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and , of course , 1980 ’s @entity244			2
having divested himself of his wife and daughter , after the former grew tired of his womanising and divorced him , the eternal bachelor moved into a mansion next door to @entity253 and down @entity254 from @entity255			0
( the road was dubbed @entity254 in their honour )			0
though @entity255 was a legendary skirt - chaser , @entity19 insiders say @entity2 left him standing when it came to success with women			1
indeed , the pair would play childish tit - for - tat games in trying to steal girlfriends off each other			2
veteran film producer @entity268 said @entity2 was the ‘ better swordsman ’ when it came to cutting through the starlet population of @entity19			2
the actor , he said , was a ‘ very big player			0
not even @entity255 has been so successful with women ’			0
better swordsman : though @entity255 was a legendary skirt - chaser , @entity19 insiders say @entity2 left him standing when it came to success with women he added : ‘ i ’ve been at parties where @entity2 ’s been there			1
@entity255 ’s been there , @entity281 ’s been there , @entity279			0
all the girls go to @entity2			2
’ naturally , @entity2 exploited the sexual opportunities stardom gave him			2
making his debut as a director in the 1971 film drama @entity288 , @entity2 decided that in - depth research was needed to find the perfect girl for the brief non-sexual nudity in the film			1
stoned on cannabis , he auditioned more than 100 attractive young actresses in his @entity19 office , making each disrobe in front of him and then subjecting them to a ‘ near - medical examination ’			0
determined : @entity2 , 76 , is now into his fifth decade at the top of the @entity19 tree , and has a record 12 @entity117 nominations under his belt @entity2 reputedly slept with 2,000 women ( he modestly insists he never counted ) , but the one that lasted the longest — 17 years amazingly — was @entity65			2
she was 14 years his junior and admitted he fulfilled a paternal need in her			0
‘ @entity2 is very definitely a real man , one who gets your blood going , ’ she told @entity39			1
it was just as well he did , as she had to put up with a lot of cheating			0
at a party thrown by @entity316 after @entity244 premiere , @entity2 could n’t make up his mind whom to pursue , but eventually ended up sharing a room for the night with @entity67 actress @entity321			0
not content , he then sent roses every hour on the hour to the other woman who had caught his eye at the party , notorious rock groupie @entity327			0
age difference never bothered @entity2			0
he was the other side of 50 when he began an affair with 19 - year - old @entity67 actress @entity331			0
stripping off for @entity333 later , she told the magazine @entity2 was a ‘ naughty little boy ’ and ‘ guaranteed non-stop sex machine into fun and games , like spankings , handcuffs , whips and @entity342 pictures ’			0
@entity65 left @entity2 for good in 1989 , tired of all the other women			0
for the next few years , his ‘ number one ’ girlfriend was @entity346 , mother of two of his four children , although she too got fed up with his womanising and left him in 1999			0
other relationships have followed with glamorous young actresses including @entity352 and @entity354 star @entity353			0
at this year ’s @entity117 , he tried one of his old chat - up lines — ‘ you look like an old girlfriend ’ — on the visibly embarrassed award winner @entity359			0
just 22 — young enough to be his granddaughter — she cringed at his attentions as she tried to give an interview			0
@entity2 , who never missed a cue on set , could n’t have failed to pick up on that one			0
he ’d always been so good at playing creepy characters			0
was he now in danger of becoming one ?			0
