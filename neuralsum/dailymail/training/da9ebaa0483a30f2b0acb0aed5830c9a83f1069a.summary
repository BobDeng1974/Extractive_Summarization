@entity0 is a force of nature			1
@entity3 is a force which defies nature			2
the weather is set fair for @entity7 but the micro-climate about to be generated by 80,000 people inside @entity10 is brewing up a storm			1
@entity3 ’s thunderous punches and the lightning fists of @entity0 threaten to make this a saturday night as electrifying as it is historic			1
the @entity35 and @entity7 ’s @entity36 each predict one - sided victories by knock - out which will leave no scope for the kind of controversy ignited by the abrupt conclusion to their first , dramatic encounter			1
you pay your money – either to be there , to watch on tv or place a bet – and you take your choice			0
the great @entity52 public are split down the middle			0
the bookmakers have @entity3 as the marginal favourite but @entity0 still close to even money			1
a majority of the fraternity of the ring appear to favour @entity3 – with @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and legendary @entity65 promoter @entity64 among those telling me that experience will out – but there are plenty of dissenters			2
war : the two fought out a brutal encounter in @entity75 in the first fight controversy : the fight was stopped by referee @entity79 in the ninth round - perhaps prematurely what everyone seems to agree upon is that @entity0 needs to win early or @entity3 gets him late			1
everyone , that is , except the combatants themselves			0
@entity0 says : ‘ i expect to ko @entity3 with a left hook in the third round but if he survives i will dominate even more the longer it goes			1
’ @entity3 says : ‘ i will box properly this time and take @entity89 out in the middle to late rounds			2
unless he actually does come out looking for that third - round win , in which case i stop him early			1
what we know for sure is that the 26 - year - old @entity0 gained the nation ’s respect with his instant flooring of @entity3 six months ago and the lead he held on the scorecards before referee @entity79 jumped hastily between them in the ninth round			1
more significantly , he also caught the attention of the world super-middleweight champion			0
@entity3 went into their first fight underestimating @entity108 to the point of under - preparing and was so irritated by the presumptuous attitude of an opponent 10 years his junior that he fought with near - suicidal anger instead of a calculating brain			2
‘ i ’m not making that mistake again , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve trained back to the physical condition i achieved in my 20s			0
’ workout : @entity3 works out in @entity119 in @entity120 earlier this week looking good : @entity0 hits the pads at @entity122 , west @entity7 that has been done by a return to road running instead of cutting corners on the treadmill and with a tough strengthening regime which has included , most eye - catchingly , the repeated battering of a lorry tyre with a heavy metal bar			1
@entity3 has also addressed his complacency issue by engaging a sports psychologist			2
he says : ‘ i will be fighting with my mind not my emotions			0
i wo n’t be charging out again looking for a quick one - shot ko to teach him a lesson — and getting caught myself			0
‘ instead of the worst @entity3 of my career , @entity89 is now facing the best @entity3 there ’s ever been			2
’ to which @entity0 says : ‘ that ’s just not true			2
he should have lost the first fight and he ca n’t win this fight			0
i ’m a better boxer than him in every aspect and he just ca n’t change			0
’ must see : media and fans pack into @entity27 to witness the weigh - in fighting talk : @entity3 and @entity0 once again went at it during the weigh - in on the opposite page , @entity60 , who is grooming @entity154 as his own heir to greatness in @entity157 , advises @entity3 to make some basic adjustments ‘ not least by keeping his left hand up by the side of his head to block those big @entity0 rights			1
’ whether he will pay heed is open to doubt			0
@entity3 knows the risk entailed in keeping that arm low but it has always been one he is prepared to take			2
armed with that iron chin he is willing to absorb a big shot so he can keep jabbing and hooking with his left from unusual and unexpected angles , adhering to the ring maxim that it is the punches opponents do not see coming which are most devastating			0
while the late friday afternoon timing of the weigh - in could create a stamina issue for @entity0 if he has to toil down to the 12 - stone limit — even though he denies he is not a 12 - round fighter — the real key to this intriguing contest lies secreted deep in the contrasting personalities of these two men			1
confident : @entity3 says he will be in better shape and a better frame of mind for the rematch both are proud and excited to be the central characters in a passion play being staged before the biggest boxing audience in @entity52 since the war			2
but while @entity0 says ‘ 80,000 or 8,000 is the same to me , ’ @entity3 declares himself ‘ honoured and humbled by the magnitude of the occasion			1
’ @entity0 reports knowledge and experience gained from the original clash , while @entity3 says : ‘ you ca n’t beat a man like me with bravado			1
’ @entity0 , as he prepares to move on to @entity203 promoters @entity204 , is setting himself the target of ‘ an impressive performance to make the world sit up and take notice			0
@entity3 says : ‘ i have no real interest in becoming a celebrity			0
it ’s the winning that comes first			0
’ the scale of interest has been driven by the public ’s love affair with these battles of @entity52 and such rematches make a lot of money for all concerned			0
better ? @entity0 said he ' expects ' to beat @entity3 in the third round with a left hook promoter @entity222 took a gamble booking @entity10 for the night after an @entity225 match but he has successfully tapped into a popular mood of fascination			1
projected @entity229 pay - per - view sales of a million may fall just short of @entity231 ’s record 1.2m for his @entity233 fight with @entity234 but if it is achieved then @entity3 will bank anything up to £ 10m , @entity0 close to £ 2m			1
being the defending champion has its purse privileges , which @entity3 has earned the hard way as he goes into his 12th straight world - title fight , all but one against the elite fighters in his division			1
although , at coming up to 37 , he has no plans for imminent retirement he was asked this week how he would like to be remembered whenever that day comes			0
@entity3 replied : ‘ as a warrior who feared no man and ducked no - one			2
’ time for action : the pair go face to face for real at @entity10 on saturday night as one who predicted he would stop @entity0 in the ninth round of the first fight , i expect @entity3 to be fractionally more patient before his world - class battle - hardening prevails again , in the 10th or 11th			1
but whatever the result , that epitaph of his has already been assured			0
@entity260 , @entity261 , is live on @entity262 .			0

@entity3 and @entity0 prepare to clash at @entity10
80,000 people will pack inside the national *stadium* on saturday night
the @entity35 is a *narrow* favourite against @entity269
huge purse could be worth up to £ 10m for @entity3 and £ 2m for @entity0
i predict a battle - hardened @entity3 to win in the 10th or 11th round
