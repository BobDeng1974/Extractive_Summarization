by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 4 march 2013 it has always been said a few stiff drinks make the plainest face more inviting - but ‘ beer goggles ’ do not make us think people are more attractive than they are , experts have claimed			1
it is rather a fluke of nature that alcohol closes down the section of the mind that stops us acting on impulse long before it deadens the ‘ reptilian ’ part responsible for our sexual urges , says dr @entity17			1
the area of the brain that makes us want to mate is the oldest part - and sited so far down it keeps functioning however much we drink - until we are ready to pass out			2
' beer goggles ' do not make us think people are more attractive than they are , brain expert dr @entity17 claims dr @entity26 says it is a myth that beer goggles fool us into thinking someone is more attractive than they really are			1
but even relatively small amounts of alcohol will stop the various parts of the brain working properly together			2
dr @entity26 , senior lecturer in the @entity35 at @entity36 , has been pulling together a range of research into how alcohol affects the brain , as the nation ’s drink problem increases			1
she says that while evolution had made women more choosy about who they go to bed with , both sexes are looking for a soul mate - and personality is just as important as looks in selecting a partner			0
however , all this goes out of the window when we drink because of the sequence in which alcohol acts on areas of the brain			2
she said : ‘ alcohol switches off the rational and decision making areas of the brain while leaving the areas to do with sexual desire relatively intact , and so this explains beer goggles			1
‘ we still see others basically as they are			0
there is no imagined physical transformation - just more desire			0
’ however , a number of previous studies have suggested we start seeing things when the opposite sex and alcohol are involved			0
alcohol affects the part of the mind responsible for impulse before the part responsible for sexual urges , claims scientist a @entity85 experiment claimed people do appear more attractive to both sexes after they have had a drink			1
@entity90 research maintained that men rated pictures of women more highly after looking at alcohol - linked words and @entity96 ’s @entity95 claimed men and women had problems rating faces for attractiveness after drinking			0
however , dr @entity26 ’s book , @entity104 , argues men and women do not see each other any differently no matter how much they drink			1
but after as little as half a pint of beer alcohol starts bonding with the receptors of the upper lobes which control decision - making			2
the more primitive section of the brain in the cortex below which governs our sex drive is carrying on unaffected			0
normally , this part of the brain is kept in check by the upper lobes			2
so , while sober we are constantly weighing up questions of looks versus personality in our search for the right soul mate			0
when sober you would look at a member of the opposite sex and decide you were not attracted to them			0
but that decision making process was impaired by alcohol			0
however , a bag of crisps or peanuts could stop things getting out of hand , dr @entity26 says			1
‘ you would have some food in your stomach and the salt would aid rehydration by retaining water and stopping you pee - ing it all away , ’ she said			0
the first area of the brain to be affected by alcohol is cerebellum - the motor control area			2
next to go is the frontal lobes which control our rational decision - making			0
sexual desire is in the reptilian section of the mind under the cortex			1
even though women use both sides of the brain to make sexual decisions this was no defence against alcohol			1
' beer goggles ' affect both sides of the brain , particularly the frontal lobes which we use to make decisions and recognise the consequences of our actions			1
the other thing which informs sexual desire is pheromones which we can smell and cause us to be attracted subconsciously to people with different immune systems so off - spring will have elements of both and be stronger			1
once the brain started rehydrating and the alcohol loosened its grip on the receptors of the brain it had bound to and rational thinking returned			2
dr @entity26 said : ‘ memory may not come back but rationality does			1
as the brain rehydrates and the toxins are flushed away the alcohol ceases to bind to the brain receptors and the frontal lobes kick back in			2
’ she believes that the booze culture needed more research before a whole new generation was born to couples who could not stand each other			0
while love - hate relationships have now been largely explained away by pheromones - which trigger the basic instinct to mate - drink - fuelled romance was being driven by social change			0
traditionally , it was the man who - having had one too many - made the advances while the more sober woman decided whether to accept or reject			0
but with more and more men and women being flung together by booze , dr @entity26 argues it is vital to understand how the rules of attraction are bent by over indulgence : ‘ we have got to try and work out what the social effect alcohol is having now in an era when contraception is widely available and we have a culture where drinking is the norm , ’ she said			1
‘ new studies are going to be very interesting in how it affects the rules of attraction			0
‘ pheromones may be turned off by beer goggles			1
it ’s entirely possible they are - but we do n’t know			0

' beer goggles ' do not make us think people are more attractive , says @entity36 expert dr @entity26
alcohol closes the part of the brain responsible for impulse before the part responsible for sexual desire
