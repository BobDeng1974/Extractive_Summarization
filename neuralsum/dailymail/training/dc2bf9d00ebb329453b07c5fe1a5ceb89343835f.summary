by @entity0 last updated at 7:17 pm on 25th november 2011 it will give shopping centres valuable data on where customers go and how long they spend there			2
but it might feel a bit like they 're spying on you			0
two @entity11 malls in @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity14 , are launching a trial to track shopper ’s movements through their mobile phone signals			1
the novel idea will run between @entity20 and @entity21 at @entity22 in @entity14 and @entity23 in @entity12			1
new idea : two @entity11 malls in @entity12 and @entity14 are launching a trial to track shopper 's movements through their mobile phone signals ( file picture ) @entity28 , which manages both malls , will not hold personal data as everything tracked is anonymous , reported @entity32			1
with millions of @entity11 being worked up into a sweat over potential bargains to be had on @entity20 , scientists have come up with the perfect way of working out what excites them the most			1
wearing perspiration - sensitive brace , 50 shoppers in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 were monitored by experts from the @entity45 the information they retrieve will then be sold on to retailers , who are always keen to find out what makes people spend			2
crucially , the bracelet wearers will shop both in store and online – allowing firms to discover what difference – if any – it makes to the buying experience			0
it measures movement , body temperature and electrodermal activity – barely noticeable changes in skin sweat levels , the @entity57 reported			0
if a shopper ’s excited or frustrated , electrodermal activity will go up			0
if they ’re relaxed or bored , it will go down			0
‘ we wo n't be looking at singular shoppers , ’ @entity28 ’s @entity67 told @entity32			2
‘ the system monitors patterns of movement			0
‘ we can see , like migrating birds , where people are going to , ’ she added , saying they have no need to know anybody ’s phone number or identity			1
shopping centres have previously tracked the movement of people - but mobile phones have never been used to achieve this			0
customers do not have to participate in the trial - but they will have to turn off their phones to make sure they are n't involved , reported @entity32			2
signs around the malls are already warning people about the system , which works through a number of strategically - positioned antennas			1
they will pick up the phone ’s identification number and track it through the area , but it can not take photos or store purchase details , reported @entity32			1
the technology has been used in @entity101 and @entity102 , but that does not stop some critics getting worried about the system ’s security			0
‘ most of this information is harmless and nobody ever does anything nefarious with it , ’ @entity107 of @entity108 told @entity32			0
on call : customers do not have to participate in the trial - but they will have to turn off their phones to ensure this ( file picture ) ‘ but ( what ) happens when you start having hackers potentially having access to this information and being able to track your movements ? ’ hackers ' attempts will however be made more difficult by the fact the identification numbers will be scrambled twice .			1

trial to run between @entity20 and @entity21
two malls in @entity12 and @entity14 will track shoppers
antenna will follow your phone 's identification number
