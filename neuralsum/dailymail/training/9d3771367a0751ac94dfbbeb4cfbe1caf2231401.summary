by @entity0 estimate , one of the best horses ever owned by the @entity3 , could have run her last race after trailing home last behind @entity7 in the @entity8			1
nine days after making global headlines when it emerged she was one of seven horses to test positive to @entity13 — a case linked to contaminated feed which means she will be disqualified from her second place in the @entity17 in june — the sir @entity19 - trained mare , ridden by @entity20 , appeared ill - at - ease on @entity22 ’s gradients and never looked like justifying her position as 2 - 1 favourite			1
it was a second career defeat at the track , with @entity28 ( below ) having finished third in the 2012 @entity29			1
it is understood the horse was one of the runners in the @entity8 line - up subject to a post-race dope test			1
given the backdrop to the race , the @entity36 had little option			1
it was entirely a cosmetic but necessary procedure to head off any conspiracy theorists			2
emotional : @entity20 ( right ) had to be consoled by his trainer sir @entity19 after last - place finish with running options now thin on the ground , retirement is now a big option			1
that would be a sad end to a career for a mare who gave her owner one of her most joyous days on a racecourse with victory in the 2013 @entity17			2
certainly plans for an exciting potential swansong in @entity58 ’s @entity57 in november look certain to be shelved			2
@entity19 said : ‘ @entity20 said she was n’t letting herself down and i was n’t happy from a long way out			1
’ royal racing adviser @entity61 added : ‘ we were hopeful that if she did well that we would be brave enough to go to the @entity64 to sharpen her up and see if she had enough toe for @entity67			2
now we are back to the drawing board			0
the option are so limited			0
we will have to see what the @entity3 thinks			0
’ a second shot at the @entity57 is a possibility for @entity73 - owned @entity7 , who finished a neck in front of @entity77 - trained stablemate @entity78			1
back of the pack : the @entity80 was riding the @entity3 's horse estimate at the @entity82 on thursday third , four and a half lengths further back in a race run at an uneven tempo , was @entity88 - owned 2013 winner @entity86			1
definitely retired is @entity90 - trained @entity89			0
the @entity64 mare , who was third in the @entity17 , sustained a suspensory ligament injury when bravely winning the @entity29 under @entity94			0
a sense of excitement swept the track when it emerged film star @entity98 was a guest of @entity22 ’s owner @entity99			0
he generated a frenzy of attention when presenting model @entity102 with her prize for winning the charity @entity105			0
@entity98 is best known for his mission : impossible films and trainer @entity108 must have felt that finding a winner was getting that way after five seconds on the opening two days			0
but the tide turned as his two - year - olds @entity114 and @entity115 scored under @entity116			0
the latter , impressive in the @entity118 , is 8 - 1 favourite for next year ’s @entity120 with @entity121 .			0

@entity20 finished last in @entity82
he was @entity80 in 2006 , 2008 and 2009
rode into last place on a horse owned by the queen
