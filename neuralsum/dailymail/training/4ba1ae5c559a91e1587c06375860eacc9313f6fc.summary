by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 19:55 est , 22 may 2013 @entity1 yesterday won backing from the @entity3 , as it welcomed improvements in the economy			1
it will come as a relief to the chancellor who was last month heavily criticised by the watchdog 's chief economist for sticking to his austerity policies			2
the @entity3 yesterday urged mr @entity1 to cut business taxes and increase infrastructure spending to build on the burgeoning recovery			1
managing director of the @entity3 @entity17 arrives to the @entity19 finance ministers meeting in @entity20 ( left ) and @entity1 it also warned the country remains ' a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery ' because of the eurozone crisis , a shortage of bank lending and government cuts			1
the annual report on the @entity30 , published after two weeks of in - depth analysis by @entity3 inspectors , called for extra spending to offset the impact of his planned cuts this year but stopped short of demanding that austerity is ditched altogether			1
indeed , it backed the chancellor 's ' essential ' efforts to eliminate the record £ 159billion deficit racked up by @entity42 and described his plans as ' credible '			1
mr @entity1 said : ' i agree that it is right to prioritise infrastructure investment where we can			2
' that 's why we are investing more in capital than my predecessor planned			2
that 's why i 've added in the last two years to those plans			0
and that 's why it will be a focus of the spending round next month			2
' the @entity3 report came as official figures yesterday showed the government borrowed £ 119.5billion last year , slightly down from £ 120.9billion in 2011 - 12			0
while backing the deficit reduction , the @entity3 report went on to warn that the £ 10billion of cuts due this year ' will be a drag on growth '			1
the chancellor addressed a press conference at the @entity66 , with @entity3 assessors looking on after their issued their call for measures to boost growth to ensure stronger growth , the report called for tax cuts for businesses and billions of pounds of extra spending on infrastructure projects such as schools repairs and social housing			1

' it also called on ministers to outline a ' clear strategy ' for selling government stakes in taxpayer - backed lenders @entity89 and @entity90			0
and it urged the @entity92 to consider pumping more money into the economy and ' provide assurance ' to households and investors that interest rates will remain at rock bottom ' until the recovery reaches full momentum '			0
the analysis of the chancellor 's handling of the economy was better than many in the @entity66 feared			0
last month the @entity3 's chief economist @entity107 accused mr @entity1 of ' playing with fire ' by sticking with his austerity policies while the economy was so weak			1
however , @entity111 , deputy to @entity3 managing director @entity17 , acknowledged ' there is no single silver bullet ' to solve the @entity30 's problems			2
he said : ' we recognise that higher fiscal support for the economy is not a straight forward as the deficit is still high			0
' but the government 's credible medium - term consolidation plan affords space to provide this support			0
' the government should be more supportive of growth than it has been and plans to be			0
' shadow chancellor @entity125 said : ' the @entity3 is clear that we are a long way from the strong and sustained recovery we need , and backs the warnings we have made for three years that the government 's plans are a drag on growth and risk doing long - term damage			1
' but @entity135 , director general of the @entity136 , said : ' the @entity3 's assessment chimes with our own view that a modest recovery looks to be taking shape			1
but there is still room for manoeuvre to boost growth and jobs within the current strategy			0
' the government must now dramatically step up the pace of action in these areas			0
