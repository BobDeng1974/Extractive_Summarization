by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 07:58 est , 30 november 2012 custom - designed personal electronics could soon be available thanks to a new material that can be used to 3d print objects including working sensors			1
the material , nicknamed ‘ carbomorph ’ , enables users to lay down electronic tracks and sensors as part of a @entity12 printed structure			1
this could , for example , allow the printer to create touch - sensitive areas which can then be connected to a simple electronic circuit board			2
breakthrough : @entity20 's dr @entity19 holds a video games controller he and his team @entity12 printed using a new material that is both conductive and piezo - resistive the revolutionary new material was created by a team from the @entity20 , who have so far used it to to print gloves with embedded flex sensors and computer game controllers with touch - sensitive buttons			1
the next step is to work on printing much more complex structures and electronic components including the wires and cables required to connect the devices to computers			2
dr @entity19 of @entity20 's @entity39 led the research , which is detailed in a study published in the open - access journal @entity43			1
while 3d printers have until now been useful for basic prototyping , the products they create are disappointingly inert and functional elements like electronic sensors have had to be to be manually attached			1
fully working : the material , nicknamed carbomorph , enables users to lay down electronic tracks and sensors as part of a @entity12 printed structure ' it ’s always great seeing the complex and intricate models of devices such as mobile phones or television remote controls that can be produced with 3d printing , ' dr @entity19 said			1
' but that ’s it , they are invariably models that do n’t really function			0
' ' we set about trying to find a way in which we could actually print out a functioning electronic device from a 3d printer			2
' in order to achieve their goal , dr @entity19 's team created carbomorph , a conductive medium which could be made into shapes with 3d printers			0
it is based on @entity82 filler , a readily available , inexpensive byproduct of the petrochemical industry , which conducts electricity			0
the team mixed the @entity82 with a readily available modelling plastic called polymorph until they had a substance that was usable in 3d printers but still conducted electricity			0
even more useful , the new material was also found to be piezo - resistive , meaning that its electrical resistance changes when it is squeezed			2
the paper describes how the @entity20 team were able to use multiple strips of carbomorph to build an ' exo - glove ' which is capable of detecting fingers flexing , and in a release they showed a computer game controller made entirely of the stuff , right down to working buttons			1
multiple applications : the @entity20 team were able to use multiple strips of carbomorph to build an ' exo - glove ' which is capable of detecting fingers flexing dr @entity19 and his team hope their new material could ' meet the demands of entrepreneurs , designers and artists wishing to create ever more complex and high - tech products ' using 3d printing			1
anyone in the world could soon have access to a 3d printable gun through the internet			0
a @entity123 start - up plans to distribute schematics for the weapons free of charge			0
@entity127 , a company which wants to extend the @entity123 second amendment rights to the entire world , hopes to test prototypes of the printable weapons by the end of the year			0
' this project could very well change the way we think about gun control and consumption , ' the organisation says on their website			0
' how do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the @entity145 ? let ’s find out			0
' ' in the long term , this technology could revolutionise the way we produce the world around us , making products such as personal electronics a lot more individualised and unique and in the process reducing electronic waste , ' dr @entity19 said			2
' designers could also use it to understand better how people tactilely interact with products by monitoring sensors embedded into objects			2
' however , in the short term i can see this technology having a major impact in the educational sector			0
' for example , allowing the next generation of young engineers to get hands - on experience of using advanced manufacturing technology to design fairly high - tech devices and products right there in the classroom			1
' the printed sensors can be monitored using existing open - source electronics and freely available programming libraries			1
a major advantage of using 3d printing is that sockets for connection to equipment such as interface electronics can be printed out instead of connected using conductive glues or paints .			0

researchers from @entity20 say electronic tracks and sensors can now be integral to a @entity12 printed structure
they hope their new material will be useful to entrepreneurs and *trainee* engineers prototyping new high - tech products
