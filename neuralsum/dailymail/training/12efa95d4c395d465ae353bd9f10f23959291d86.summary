@entity0 hope to have @entity2 coach @entity1 in place as their new manager by the end of the week			1
the @entity8 champions are digging in their heels over compensation for the man hailed in his homeland as his the new @entity13			1
however , @entity1 ’s agent @entity14 was in @entity15 to agree terms on wednesday and @entity0 hope that the deal can be concluded quickly			1
to the rescue : is @entity1 the man to save @entity0 ? incoming : @entity21 coach @entity1 could be appointed this week that will obviously depend on a compromise being reached with his current club as the 38 - year - old ’s reward for leading @entity2 to their first title in 43 years was a new contract until 2016			1
speaking after @entity2 crashed out of the @entity30 following a 4 - 2 extra-time defeat in @entity32 , a cagey @entity1 gave little away , insisting : ‘ it ’s just speculation			1
and there will always be speculation around people who are doing well			2
‘ of course i am flattered			0
it ’s great to be linked to a club like @entity0			1
but i ’ve been in this game for a long time , and nothing is secure yet			0
’ asked how he will respond if @entity0 formally offer him the job , @entity1 added : ‘ that ’s speculation			1
’ big character : @entity1 has been likened to @entity45 coach @entity13 who is well admired @entity1 stepped into the manager ’s chair in 2008 after playing for the club and has improved the league position every year since , culminating in a cup win four years ago and @entity2 ’s first championship win since 1970			1
he signed a new deal in the winter after travelling abroad on a training trip to visit @entity13 in @entity45			1
@entity55 understands he was originally considered as a potential replacement for @entity57 as @entity58 2 under @entity59			2
asked if he had paid any visits to @entity61 , however , he said : ‘ no , i was never there			0
i have just watched a game there once			0
’ @entity1 is credited with developing @entity65 , the midfielder who joined @entity0 in a £ 1.5million deal last january , and building a formidable team on a fraction of rivals @entity70 ’s budget			1
rejection : @entity71 reportedly turned down the job linked : @entity73 was also believed to be in the running @entity75 , @entity71 and @entity73 have all been spoken to by @entity61 powerbrokers over the role vacated by @entity59 a fortnight ago			1
but @entity61 sources have confirmed @entity1 is now the frontrunner and chief executive @entity79 hopes to make an announcement on the new man in the coming days			2
‘ there ’s nothing more we can say , we are still working on it , ’ said @entity79			0
‘ but hopefully we can over the next few days or at least during the next week , have something to say			0
‘ we talk to more people and hopefully we will get the right man soon			0
’ @entity8 media reports say @entity79 contacted @entity2 to express an interest in speaking to @entity1 on tuesday night			2
compensation now looks to be the greatest obstacle to agreement			0
‘ it ’s always fun when there is speculation in the media about the players and coaches of @entity2 , ’ said the @entity8 club ’s chief executive @entity94			2
‘ it shows that we have arrived on the map of @entity104			0
on behalf of the club , it is flattering			0
‘ but we have no comments in relation to any requests for our players or coaches			0
‘ generally speaking , we think is it exciting and nice that they are being linked with major clubs in @entity104			0
it says something that we have built the club over time			0
’ @entity70 and @entity120 club @entity118 have been linked with moves for the talented coach in the recent past , but @entity2 chairman @entity124 refused to comment , saying : ‘ you know for sure that we can not comment on rumours			2
’ outgoing : @entity59 stepped down as @entity0 boss at the end of last season			1
