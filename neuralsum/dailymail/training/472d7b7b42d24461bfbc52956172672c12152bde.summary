@entity0 saw nearly 600 earthquakes in 24 hours last week - the worst swarm of tremors in nearly a decade			2
monitors show a concentration of seismic activity in the region which has sent shockwaves through the the @entity9 town			1
starting just before 5am on thursday they have ranged between 1.0 and 3.8 in magnitude			1
yellow dots show tremors in the last 12 hours and green in the last 24 hours at least 109 of the earthquakes were magnitude 2.0 or greater , and at least six , however , were greater than magnitude 3.0			2
a member of the @entity21 told the @entity22 that it is the worst spell seen in @entity9 's @entity24 in at least 10 years			1
researcher @entity25 said that they now be tracking the area - one of the most seismically active in the country - closely			1
even though they have sent ripples through the community , residents say they are used to it as there are constantly small shocks			1
there are 17 volcanoes in the region , however most of them are dormant , while there are a countless number of fault lines across the @entity42 - a 20 - mile depression next to @entity44			1
the crater was formed 760,000 years ago during a ' super-eruption ' which saw hot ash blanket most of the @entity49 states mr @entity25 described that deep down in the earth , there is magma , but it is not moving and not what is causing the earthquakes			0
the swarms are partly caused by volcanic activity under @entity44 - a volcano which has n't erupted in 57,000 years he said : ' it does n't mean that the volcano is any more active , ' he said			2
' it 's an ongoing process in an volcanic system			0
' the earthquakes are usually triggered when water and carbon dioxide above the magma move to higher layers of the earth 's crust and cracks in the faults			0
the increase in fluid pressure sets off the movements			0
in the 1980s , the area was hit with a succession 6.0 - magnitude tremors			0
however it may have been overshadowed by the @entity76 eruption in @entity77 - when 57 people died			0
at the beginning of this year , residents commemorated the 20th anniversary of the @entity83 earthquake			0
it centered in @entity85 , a neighborhood in the north - central @entity87 region of @entity88 , killing 57 people and injuring more than 5,000			0
there are a countless number of fault lines across the @entity42 - a 20 - mile crater or depression next to @entity44			1

@entity95 started just before 5am on thursday in the town in @entity9
shocks ranged from between 1.0 and 3.8 in magnitude
researchers from the @entity21 says it is the worst in 10 years
the @entity104 is one of the most seismically active areas in the @entity107
it has 17 volcanoes and a large amount of small fault lines running through
