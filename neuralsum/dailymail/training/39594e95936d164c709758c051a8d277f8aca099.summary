after a few delays and almost 9 years after the last installment , @entity3 3 charms its way onto the @entity5 but is it a ‘ must have ’ @entity8 exclusive that will help shift more @entity5 consoles ? whilst it ’s a title well worth owning , as a potential ‘ system seller ’ it inadvertently highlights some key flaws with @entity8 and the @entity5 the game sets the scene in a potential not - too - distant future @entity17 scenario ; the world is overpopulated and all food sources have been depleted			1
probing vessels are launched out into space to find a planet that could potentially house additional food sources that can be brought back to @entity17			0
vibrant : there is no denying that @entity26 is one of the @entity5 's best - looking titles fortunately , one such planet was found and on their entry into its atmosphere , our three characters @entity32 , @entity33 and captain @entity34 become separated			1
the adventure begins here as the characters have to reunite themselves , find enough food sources to avoid hunger and feed the population back home and find a way to power their ship to get them back home			2
thankfully this new world is inhabited by very friendly pikmin who are happy to help out			0
in @entity3 3 players are encouraged to explore their surroundings and discover the best ways to navigate obstacles , whilst utilising the best way to use the various forms of @entity26 available			1
each different colour @entity3 has its own ability , red pikmin withstand fire , black rock @entity3 shatter crystal obstacles , yellow can be thrown high and are immune to electricity , blue are resistant to water and winged @entity26 that can fly			1
each different @entity3 type allows for the game to be played in a number of different ways			1
previous areas can be re-explored once new pikmin types are encountered allowing for a good balance in strategy and exploratory gameplay			2
players will have to decide which @entity3 to use for which obstacle whilst also attempting to split tasks between the three characters			1
however , all exploring must be done in daylight hours with all @entity3 returning to their ‘ @entity81 ’ ( their home ) , before dark lest the wild beasts catch them			1
yet as each day passes more food is consumed by the characters so constant exploration to find food is key during daylight hours			2
pikmin are controlled using the @entity92 , which is where one of problems lies			1
it simply is n’t ideal controlling a crosshair with the @entity5 gamepad to whistle commands , throw pikmin and navigate obstacles			0
the cursor movement just does n’t quite lend itself to the game			0
@entity104 : despite some control issues , there 's plenty here to sink your teeth into use a standard wiimote though and the game plays perfectly , yet as you ca n’t do this for off - tv play it ’s an exercise in futility			2
the @entity5 has often played on its innovation and the capabilities of the system and gamepad			0
it ’s ironic for @entity8 that one of its most anticipated titles could have played better on its previous hardware			0
that being said @entity26 is still a very fun , charming experience with immersive strategy and exploration elements			2
there ’s plenty to sink teeth into and packs a lot more of a punch than previous @entity5 titles			0
it may not quite save the system , but it ’s a worthy addition to the @entity5 nonetheless			0
let us know what you think on @entity138 : @ @entity139 and on @entity140 : @entity141 .			0

charming characters and *visuals*
well - balanced gameplay
lots of @entity3 who all have different abilities
poor *integration* with the @entity92
