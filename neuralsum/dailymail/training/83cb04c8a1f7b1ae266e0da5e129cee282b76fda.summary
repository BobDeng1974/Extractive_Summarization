by @entity0 they were intended to be among the first animals to join the 350 - mile - high club , but now a group of geckos sent into space to reproduce may be at risk			1
the five lizards - four male and one female - launched on a research satellite on 19 july to study the effects of weightlessness on their sex lives			1
but @entity15 space officials have now revealed that the @entity18 - @entity17 satellite is not responding to commands , and there are fears the mission may be lost			1
a satellite containing five geckos is feared out of control			2
the five lizards are flying in the @entity28 experiment aboard the satellite ( shown )			2
they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity			0
their habitat , monitored by video camera , has enough food for two months five lizards are flying on the @entity28 experiment aboard the satellite			2
contained in a small room , they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity			0
the species being used is the @entity48 ornate day gecko ( @entity50 ornate ) , according to @entity51 , which can reach up to 4.7 inches ( 12 centimetres ) in length			0
inside their habitat is a ventilation system to supply fresh air , food for two months , environmental control in the form of temperature and light and a waste disposal system			0
a video camera is being used to monitor their behaviour and any eggs that are produced			0
these are expected to hatch after 40 days , which means they would hatch while the mission is still in space - an important goal that would assess the effects of microgravity on birth			1
if control of the satellite is regained , the geckos and their offspring will be assessed on their return to @entity81			2
the @entity82 of satellites are a continuation of the @entity15 @entity86 spacecraft , which are intended to observe the effects of space travel on different species			2
aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms from both @entity15 and @entity96			1
the two - month mission was planned to monitor by video how well the geckos sexually reproduce in space before returning them safely to @entity81			1
following the launch , the satellite was failing to respond to commands to start its engine and move to a higher orbit , according to the progress space firm			0
however the rest of its systems are operating nominally , which means the animals on board are still alive			1
‘ the equipment which is working in automatic mode , and in particular the experiment with the geckos is working according to the programme , ’ said @entity113 , a spokesman of @entity15 's @entity114 , which is running the experiment			0
@entity121 said the design of the @entity17 ‘ allows for the functioning of the satellite in automatic mode for a long time			2
’ the biological experiment launched from the @entity126 in @entity127 last week is feared lost			1
ground controllers are unable to communicate with the @entity18 - @entity17 satellite ( illustration shown )			1
the @entity18 series of satellites are designed to perform biological experiments in space a space expert cited by @entity136 said that in its current orbit the satellite could stay up in space as long as three or four months			1
regaining control over the satellite 's engine will be needed to ensure its controlled return to @entity81 as planned in two months to recover the geckos for further study			1
at the moment the spacecraft is stuck in an orbital height of about 155 miles ( 250 kilometres )			0
the original mission specification , however , called for the spacecraft to be raised to an altitude of 357 miles ( 575 km )			0
but the planned burn to get the spacecraft to this height did not occur after the launch due to a malfunction , leaving it stuck in a lower orbit			0
ground controllers are now rushing to try and regain communication , as it 's unknown how long it can survive at this lower orbit with atmospheric drag			1
if control is regained , the capsule will re-enter @entity81 's atmosphere in mid-september and land via parachute in southern @entity15			0
failure to do so will mean it will be unlikely that the animals on board can be returned alive to @entity81			2
a similar fate befell gerbils , mice and fish aboard a @entity15 @entity173 satellite last year , which crashed shortly after launch			0
pictured is the launch of the satellite on a @entity178 rocket from @entity126 in the early hours of 19 july			0
aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms			1
it is a continuation of @entity15 's @entity86 series of satellites , which are also designed to perform biological experiments in space			0

a biological experiment launched from @entity127 last week is feared lost
ground controllers are unable to communicate with the @entity18 - @entity17 satellite
on board it has five geckos intended to reproduce and test the effects of microgravity on reproduction
but while the animals are alive , the satellite can not be controlled
this means that the planned landing in two months might not be possible
