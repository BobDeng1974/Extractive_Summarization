the barristers ’ chambers led by @entity4 has indicated it will support the strike , in which the elite lawyers who work as trial advocates have said they will refuse to turn up to court on monday morning			1

there is n’t a position from him personally			0
’ mr @entity4 has been head of @entity31 since 2010 – billed in legal directories as ‘ the chambers of @entity34 ’ – and so can be assumed to have been a leading voice in the chambers ’ discussions about the dispute			2

yesterday , mr @entity40 ’s civil servants published figures showing 1,200 barristers are paid more than £ 100,000 a year in public money for work in the criminal courts , and that 300 of them were paid more than £ 200,000 in fees from the taxpayer			0
mr @entity40 proposes to cut legal aid fees for criminal barristers in everyday trials by around 10 per cent , and to chop as much as 30 per cent off the bills of barristers appearing in the longest - running and most expensive cases			2
a spokesman for the chambers said though it was backing the action , the prime minister 's brother had no ' personal position ' there will also be an attempt to cut the number of spurious cases brought by prisoners and funded by legal aid , an end to automatic legal aid for anybody with a disposable income higher than £ 37,500 a year , a squeeze on judicial review cases and a residency test to try to stop those without connections to the @entity84 getting legal aid for civil cases			1
