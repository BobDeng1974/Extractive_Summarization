consumers in @entity4 and the @entity12 have taken to @entity13 irked at the implication that anything over a size 10 is considered ' large '			1
the @entity1 line - which is accompanied by the tag ' it suits me and i like it ' - is a 400 - piece collection available online now and in stores from tomorrow			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' the secret to this new project lies in the care taken in the technical pattern details from size to size and in being able to offer a high quality collection for any moment of the day , aimed at a modern and demanding woman who wants to feel attractive , sexy and fashionable			2
' consequently , the aim of @entity34 by @entity2 is to dress a young target market in sizes 12 to 24 with garments designed to be comfortable , feminine and modern			1

a campaign group in @entity4 have called for the line 's withdrawal			2

i would like to see more retailers doing the same			0

' what differentiates said brand is the attention to technical details , pattern to pattern and size to size , and the selection of garment materials and fabrics , which have been produced to be more comfortable , feminine and modern			0
