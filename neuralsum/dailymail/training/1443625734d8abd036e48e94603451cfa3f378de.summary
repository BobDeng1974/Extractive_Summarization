by @entity0 sir @entity1 , chairman of the taxpayer - funded high - speed rail scheme , said it would be wrong to ‘ skimp ’ on employing workers for the £ 50billion project opponents of the costly @entity8 rail project have reacted with fury after its boss said he needed to hire at least 20 to 30 people on more than the prime minister ’s £ 142,500 salary in the next six months			1
sir @entity1 , chairman of the taxpayer - funded high - speed rail scheme , said it would be wrong to ‘ skimp ’ on employing workers for the £ 50billion project			1
but mps today said the project had turned into a ‘ glorious gravy train ’ and accused bosses of showing ‘ complete disregard ’ for those having to stump up the money			2
sir @entity1 , who himself is paid £ 597,000 , said it was ‘ absolutely essential ’ to pay more to get the right people for the jobs			1
‘ the worst money you can save is skimping on hiring the best people , ’ he told @entity27			2
‘ i am determined that we hire the best people			2
we are not going to pay over the odds , we probably wo n't even pay what the private sector would pay			0
’ he added : ‘ we have to have the flexibility to hire the right people now rather than when something gets into a problem in years to come			2
' sir @entity1 said the staff would be held accountable for their performance and ‘ if they do n't perform they 'll go ’			1
‘ they wo n't be on long - term government pensions or long - term tenure , ’ he said			0
‘ at a senior level , you are talking about people above the prime minister 's salary , in the next six months we need to hire 20 or 30 of those at least to do a project of this size			1
’ earlier this year , @entity8 hired new chief executive @entity56 on a salary of £ 750,000			1
@entity58 , conservative mp for @entity59 , said that the spending was ‘ out of control ’			0
he said : ‘ i find these salaries hard to justify , but it is hard to justify the cost of the whole project			2
‘ it just goes to show the enormous amount of money that will have to be spent to get dubious returns			0
it confirms what many of us feared			0
‘ i do not agree that these salaries would be paid in the private sector			2
i think people think , ' oh it ’s public money , so we ’ll spend it '			0
’ @entity78 , @entity79 mp for @entity80 , said : ‘ this just confirms my worry that @entity8 will be another massive folly that we pour endless money into			1
‘ taxpayers will have to fund these massive salaries and have every right to get mad			0
it is ridiculous and shows a complete disregard for those paying for this			0
the project is turning into one glorious gravy train and i do n’t like it			0
‘ at a time when money is desperately needed for other transportation links this seems wrong			0
there just is not a desperate need for a faster link to @entity101			1
’ @entity103 , director of the @entity85 ’ @entity102 , said : ‘ @entity8 is a ridiculous vanity project that ’s already going to cost every man , woman and child a cool £ 1,000			1
‘ inflated salaries are only going to push the cost up even further and those in charge of @entity8 have a moral duty to spend taxpayers ’ money appropriately			1
it ’s time to scrap this extortionate train - set before it derails the public finances			0
’ the first phase of @entity8 between @entity101 and @entity118 is due to be complete in 2026 , before the second phase of a y - shaped section linking the line to @entity122 and @entity123 is due to be finished in 2032 - 33			1
the total cost of the project is estimated at £ 42.6bn , of which £ 14.56bn is contingency , with a further £ 7.5bn needed for the high - speed trains			1
however , sir @entity1 refused to give a guarantee that the project would not run over budget			1
he said : ‘ i can never guarantee anything personally			0
‘ what i can do it put in place the decision - making process and the right people to make sure we make the right decisions and we can properly and adequately manage the budget			0
’ the coalition government has repeatedly said public servants should not be paid more than the prime minister			0
but transport secretary @entity145 said the salaries estimated by sir @entity1 ‘ fell within the budget we 've set ’ , but would need to get @entity150 clearance			1
mr @entity145 told @entity152 : ‘ it has to go through a procedure , i have to get clearance from the @entity150 and that will be done			1
i 'm ok with that			0
’ he added : ' these people are not civil servants , they are engineers at the height of their skills who would be paid a lot more in the private sector			1
i hope we find the best people for this project			2
it 's a very important project			0
’ a spokeswoman for the prime minister said : ‘ this is a vital infrastructure project and of course it is important that we have the right people running and working on that project in order to deliver it on time and on budget and at good value for the taxpayer			2
’ earlier this week a committee of six mps began the process of scrutinising the nearly 2,000 objections to the @entity8 bill			2
the fate of the scheme will be decided in a vote of all mps .			0

sir @entity1 says it would be wrong to ' skimp ' on £ 50billion project
@entity8 body plans to employ 20 to 30 people in senior roles on over £ 142,500
anyone paid more than @entity196 must get @entity150 *permission*
line connecting @entity101 to @entity118 and the north will cut *journey* times
but *critics* say it is too *expensive* and will wreck the *countryside*
