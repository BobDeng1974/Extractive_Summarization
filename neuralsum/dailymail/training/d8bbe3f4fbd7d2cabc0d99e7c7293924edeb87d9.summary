mistletoe ... it is hard to quantify how much joy and misery one sprig of a plant could bring every year			0
it is the stuff of horrors - a drunken colleague lurching towards you at the office @entity10 with the plant held above their head			0
or , the cause of happiness , when a person finally gets to plant a smacker on the lips of a man or woman that they have been admiring from afar			0
so spare a thought for @entity24 , 22 , and @entity25 , 26 , who bravely took to the streets of @entity27 earlier this week in a competition to see who could get the most smooches from members of the public			1
the @entity36 filmed the reactions of the people they approached			1
@entity24 won the competition with double @entity25 's kiss count			1
the pair gamely took on the challenge from the social network @entity45 , who handed them go pro cameras attached to a mistletoe - covered helmet each			0
the social experiment took place in @entity51 and @entity52 on a grey monday afternoon , but they still managed to attract several kisses each			2
unsurprisingly , @entity24 came out as the clear winner at the end of the competition , with 18 men happy to provide her with a peck on the cheek or lips			1
@entity25 struggled considerably at the beginning of the experiment , with most women turning him down without a second glance , but he was saved by a group of female tourists who each gave a kiss after dancing around him in a circle and ended with a respectable nine smooches			2
@entity72 from @entity45 said : ' interestingly , the experiment found that @entity36 are more adventurous when in groups , which applies to both sexes			2
' the guys were more up for a kiss when their friends were there and encouraging them to plant a kiss on @entity24 's cheek			1
' girls were also more up for a quick smooch under the mistletoe when they were with their friends			0
' in fact , @entity25 's score shot up after a group of girls encircled him and then went for a kiss			1
