by @entity0 just when you thought it was safe to login to a secure website , hackers have found a way to steal data simply by recording the sounds a pc makes			1
using a microphone in a mobile , scientists were able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer ’s central processing unit ( cpu ) as secure information was being decrypted			1
by then identifying the certain parts of information that each of these unique sounds related to , they were able to extract the content of private emails			1
using a mobile phone , left , scientists were able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer 's cpu , right , as secure information was being decrypted			1
by identifying the certain parts of information that each of these unique sounds related to , researchers were able to extract the content of private emails when data is sent over a secure server using what ’s called an @entity36 algorithm , the cpus make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops			1
@entity36 algorithms are used to send data over web browsers and emails , for example , and involves a public key being used with a private key to package up and send information securely			1
each of these loops signifies a particular step in the decryption process , and these loops can vary depending on the type of information being sent			0
the microphone records these subtle loop sounds to build a picture of what the @entity36 key looks like			1
once it knows each part of the 4096 - bit encryption key , it uses a method called a ‘ key extraction attack ’ to reveal the information			2
this method could , in theory , also be used to steal passwords , logins or any other secure information entered into a web page			0
this is because when data is entered into a website and sent over a secure server using what ’s called an @entity36 algorithm , the cpus make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops			1
@entity36 algorithms are used to send data and involve a public key being used with a private key to package up and send this information securely			1
each of these loops signifies a particular step in the decryption process , and these loops can vary depending on the type of information being sent and the pc being used			2
the microphone records these subtle loop sounds to build a picture of what the @entity36 key looks like			1
once it knows each part of the 4096 - bit encryption key , it uses a method called a ' key extraction attack ' to reveal the information			2
this whole process can be carried out in less than an hour , according to the researchers , by low - quality microphones placed near the pc , to high - quality microphones placed up to 13ft away			0
when data is sent over a secure server and decrypted , using what 's called an @entity36 algorithm , cpus make unique and distinctive sounds known as loops			1
the microphone records these subtle loop sounds to build a picture of what the @entity36 key looks like			1
different pcs make different sounds , as shown in these recordings early this month , @entity116 computer scientists proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans			2
using built - in microphones and speakers in laptops , the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft away from each other			0
they came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘ hacker ’ machine			0
the researchers chose to use sounds that are too high pitched for humans to hear and harnessed the microphone and speakers in a @entity144 computer to transmit keystrokes from one computer to another			0
the researchers said this distance could also be increased using a laser microphone or vibrometer			0
however , in order to hack the emails in the study , the researchers did have to send thousands of encrypted emails			0
the email client had to then decrypt them all automatically , without opening individual emails			0
plus the noises made during decryption had to be clear enough to recognise and were made using a specific software called @entity162			0
it is unclear how effective the process would be if any of these variables changed			0
as the researchers explained in their paper @entity172 via @entity173 : ‘ we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack , applicable to @entity162 ’s current implementation of @entity36			2
the attack can extract full 4096 - bit @entity36 decryption keys from laptop computers ( of various models ) , within an hour , using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts			2
‘ we experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out , using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer , or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away			0
’ the developers of @entity162 have also now developed a patch for this vulnerability , included in version 1.4.16 of @entity162 .			0

scientists have found a way to hack pcs based on the noises they make
when information is sent over a server , it is encrypted to make it secure
this creates what is called a secure key using the @entity36 algorithm
later on , when this data is decrypted , the pc makes a set of unique sounds
these sounds , or cpu loops , can be used to extract the private details
