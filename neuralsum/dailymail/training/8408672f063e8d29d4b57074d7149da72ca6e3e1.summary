by @entity0 auctioneers in @entity2 were left stunned when a buyer spent £ 500,000 on three garages - even though the lot came without planning permission			1
for the same staggering amount , the owner could have bought a sprawling country retreat or even a fleet of luxury sports cars			2
but the winning bid could prove to be a bargain if planning permission is granted for the site in @entity16 , south - west @entity2 , where a semi-detached home can sell for £ 1.46 million			1
but there was so much interest in the site that the first bid came in at £ 175,000 when the lot went under the hammer at @entity45 in @entity2			1
investors in the saleroom and on the phone battled it out for the freehold garages , which have parking at the front and are built on the side of a semi-detached family home			1
the winning bidder ended up paying £ 500,000 for the three garages - almost three times the average price paid for a home in @entity30 and @entity31 last month			1
with the money spent on the sought - after garages , the owner could have bought @entity61 , a 28 - bedroom @entity62 listed manor house in @entity64 which went on the market at £ 500,000 earlier this month			1
it also could have bought five luxury @entity67 , which cost around £ 98,000 each			2
sprawling : @entity62 listed @entity61 in @entity64 went on sale for £ 500,000 earlier this month			1
as well as 28 bedrooms , the property boasts 19 reception rooms , an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms high - end home : one of the spacious reception rooms inside @entity61 , which could have been bought for the £ 500,000 spent on the three @entity2 garages			1
one estate agent called the bid a ' shrewd ' investment in the catalogue issued for the sale , @entity81 said the garages ' may be considered suitable for redevelopment or reuse '			0
however , there is currently no planning permission , making the £ 370,000 premium all the more extraordinary			0
@entity90 , divisional managing director for @entity81 , said : ' this again demonstrates the benefits of auction disposal to our clients			0
' if the unnamed buyer does manage to get planning permission , then their speculative punt could pay off			0
@entity100 says the average price of a home in @entity16 is £ 640,000 , with a terraced property costing £ 905,000			1
a semi in the area costs £ 1.46 million			2
luxury drive : for the same eye - watering amount , the new owner of the three garages could have bought five @entity110 , pictured			2
the price could prove a bargain if the owner is granted planning permission @entity115 , a property buying agent , today described the purchase as ' shrewd '			0
he said : ' i am not surprised to hear the price			0
the conversion of garages into homes is very much in vogue at the moment			0
' the mayor 's office have identified hundred of sites which could be used to solve the capital 's housing crisis			0
i expect these garages will turn out to be a shrewd place for the buyer to park their money			0
' the three garages in @entity16 is the latest big - figure sale of a lock - up in the capital			0
in may , an investor bought a row of six garages in @entity142 in the @entity143 of the city which were offered with no planning permission for £ 700,000 - ten times the estimate price			1
and in april , a former coach house in @entity148 , which was used to park the mayor of @entity151 's car , sold for £ 550,000 .			2

the row of garages in south - west @entity2 had a guide price of £ 130,000
but they sold for £ 500,000 - three times average house price in @entity30
the money could have bought sprawling @entity161 in @entity64
@entity163 could pay off as semi-detached home in area can sell for £ *1.46million*
