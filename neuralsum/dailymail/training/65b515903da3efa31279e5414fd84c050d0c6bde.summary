by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:08 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 15:26 est , 1 november 2012 a @entity3 mp was today ordered to pay compensation to her best friend after sacking her from her constituency office			1
@entity7 was awarded a payout after @entity9 , mp for @entity10 , let her go in a ‘ staff reshuffle ’			1
mrs @entity7 backed mrs @entity9 to stand for the @entity3 party before she won the seat in 2010 , and worked in her office for two years			1
@entity9 , @entity3 mp for @entity10 , was told to pay £ 1,296.68 to best friend @entity7 after sacking her from her constituency office but in february this year , she was sacked and replaced by another employee			1
despite being best friends , mrs @entity7 then started legal proceedings claiming she had been ‘ unfairly dismissed ’ mrs @entity9			1
today , judge @entity18 ruled in her favour , and ordered the mp to pay her ex-secretary £ 1,296.88			2
mrs @entity9 , is the mp for @entity10 and was elected during the 2010 general election			1
she is pictured outside number 10 handing in a petition requesting a block on pornographic websites			2
judge @entity18 said there had been an ‘ absence of consultation ’ and there had been discussion about whether mrs @entity7 would be considered for the new job			2
she said : ‘ it was conceded by the respondent that the dismissal of the claimant by reason of redundancy was unfair and so i find			2
there was clearly an absence of consultation			2
‘ although the respondent considered whether the claimant should be offered the role to which mrs @entity44 was appointed , no discussion of that possibility took place with the claimant			0
‘ in addition no notice of the meeting at which she was informed of her redundancy was given and she was not informed of her right to be accompanied at that meeting			0
’ the judge said that if a ‘ fair procedure ’ had been followed and mrs @entity7 had been consulted there was a ‘ 100 per cent likelihood ’ that she would have lost her job anyway			0
the compensation of £ 1,296.88 reflected the length of time that mrs @entity7 ’s employment might have been extended in order to enable a fair redundancy procedure			0
mrs @entity9 told the tribunal in @entity67 that she was forced to fire her friend when senior advisor , @entity69 , left his job in november 2011			0
the mp said she was unable to replace mr @entity69 and so decided to split his extensive job role between her @entity73 and @entity10 offices			1
she hired @entity44 - who was able to cover both policy and ‘ surgery only ’ roles - in her @entity10 office at the expense of mrs @entity7			1
mrs @entity9 told the hearing : ‘ it was clear from our early experiences that she [ mrs @entity7 ] would struggle with more responsibility			0
‘ the claimant required a lot of managing and support , particularly in the it area and all of this led me to believed that this would not be something she would not be able to do , she would be incapable			0
‘ i could not afford to keep mrs @entity7 on doing a surgery only job and employ someone to do a local policy job			0
i found someone who could do both			0

worked for two years and supported her through election in @entity10
