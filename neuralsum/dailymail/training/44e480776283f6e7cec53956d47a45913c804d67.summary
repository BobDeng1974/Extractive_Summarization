by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 7 december 2012 anger : @entity2 will pay £ 20million in corporation tax over the next two years after it was accused of acting ' immorally ' for not paying the levy over the last three years @entity2 last night caved in to public pressure and agreed to pay millions in corporation tax amid fears of a growing consumer boycott			1
the global coffee group struck a deal with @entity10 to pay £ 20million over the next two years , whether or not it reports a profit			1
the move will bring valuable money into @entity15 coffers and piles pressure on other multi-nationals such as @entity18 and @entity19 to restructure their affairs to make contributions			1
but critics said the figure was an ‘ arbitrary ’ contribution to try to quell public anger over @entity2 ’ financial affairs and warned it could go back to its ‘ immoral ’ tax - avoiding ways within 12 months			1
the deal , they said , was evidence of @entity30 running a ‘ voluntary ’ tax system where companies opt to pay what they like , rather than what they owe			2
@entity2 has also agreed to suspend the clever accounting techniques it used to push profits overseas and minimise its tax bill			2
it has not paid corporation tax for 14 of the past 15 years of trading in the @entity30 , despite owning more than 700 stores and taking more than £ 3billion in sales since arriving in @entity30			1
last year the coffee giant registered sales of £ 398million but claimed to make a loss of £ 33million – giving it a corporation tax bill of zero			1
but now it will hand over £ 10million for the year , under the terms of yesterday ’s deal			2
it will also pay ‘ in the region of £ 10million ’ next year , despite not knowing what its sales or profits will be			2
tax accountant @entity55 said : ‘ the accusation is that we ’re now asking for tax on a voluntary basis			0
this is n’t a church collection – if you owe it , then you should pay it			0
’ he added : ‘ my fear is that @entity2 have n’t changed anything			0
these payments are token gestures			0
’ by registering huge costs in the @entity30 , @entity2 was able to report losses year after year to the taxman , meaning it faced no corporation tax			1
freebies : a @entity2 worker hands out hot chocolate to cold shoppers in @entity76 's @entity75 , but the public are upset about the lack of tax they have paid it did this by charging its @entity30 arm royalty fees for using the @entity2 logo and coffee to a sister company in the @entity86			1
six per cent of the revenue from every cup of coffee sold in @entity30 was given to the @entity86 for the rights to use the name			0
this will be suspended for 12 months after yesterday ’s deal			0
@entity2 ’ arrangements , which critics said were designed specifically to avoid paying corporation tax , also saw it buying its coffee through @entity98 , even though the beans never arrived on @entity98 soil			1
it also took out loans from other parts of the company , located in lower - tax areas , for which it was charged large interest rates			2
yesterday @entity30 boss @entity106 said the group would put those practices on ice ‘ for two years or until we make a profit ’			0
' @entity111 ' : mp @entity112 called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the government should back boycotts like the one facing @entity2 crackdown plans : treasury chief secretary @entity119 is backing a boycott on @entity2 and other companies accused of avoiding tax he said ‘ doing the right thing is part of the @entity129 of our company ’ , but added ‘ we have always organised our tax affairs according to the letter of the law ’			0
the company last night could not offer any firm assurances that it would not reinstate its old methods for pushing profits to @entity98 and the @entity86 once the period had ended			0
it said the changes were not permanent			0
‘ offering to pay some tax if and when it suits you does n’t stop you being a tax dodger , ’ said @entity137 , a spokesman for protest group @entity138 , which is organising demonstrations in 40 @entity2 outlets this weekend			2
‘ this announcement is just a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure			1
it ’s a hollow promise			0
’ a spokesman for @entity10 said : ‘ corporation tax is not a voluntary tax and @entity150 sets out the rules and rates for businesses to follow			1
the public expects businesses to pay their fair share and @entity10 will challenge , through the courts if necessary , any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the @entity30 tax law			2
’ the move will pile pressure on @entity18 and @entity19 to bow to public pressure and contribute to government coffers			1
all three were brought before the @entity165 last month to explain why they paid little or no corporation tax			1
shadow business secretary @entity168 said : ‘ @entity2 have much to do to rebuild trust among their customers and the public			0
this is a welcome first step			0
no doubt other firms will want to consider following their lead			0

the @entity178 - owned coffee chain has paid just £ *8.6* million in corporation tax in the past 14 years
after public pressure , it will pay £ 20million to the @entity15 over the next two years
*campaigners* are *unhappy* with the pledge , and are preparing to protest at cafes on *saturday*
there are hopes that @entity19 and @entity18 will be next to pay more tax
