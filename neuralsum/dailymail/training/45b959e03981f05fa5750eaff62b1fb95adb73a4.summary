@entity0 will be bidding to host a football tournament in 2018 after all — despite the ignominy that still surrounds their doomed @entity4 campaign			1
the @entity6 board agreed at their last meeting that @entity0 would apply to stage the @entity8 , with the decision due to be made by the @entity11 executive committee in @entity12 at the end of this month			1
@entity6 relations with @entity15 remain at rock bottom , ruling out any ambition of hosting a global competition for the foreseeable future			2
@entity20 would be the hub for the @entity23 under 17 championship in 2018 - if the bid is successful but there are no such problems with @entity11 , with whom the @entity6 have been bridge - building since the vote debacle in @entity30 in 2010			1
and that despite three of the @entity11 executive — @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 — taking part in the flawed @entity4 election			1
the @entity8 tournament , in which @entity39 ’s @entity4 - winning goalscorer @entity38 made his name , will feature 16 nations in 2018			2
the @entity6 plan is for @entity20 , outside @entity43 , to be the hub of the event , with other matches at nearby grounds			0
there is little or no job security in professional football , so the social media app @entity52 , designed to connect football people and help them find a role in the game , is starting to make an impression			0
this has been helped by the involvement in the burgeoning business of founder and double @entity62 @entity61			0
his hands - on approach included offering @entity52 membership to @entity68 midfielder @entity67 , who had advertised himself for work anywhere in the world on business recruitment site @entity71			0
@entity73 legend @entity61 hopes @entity52 will help people connect together and find a role in the game the remarkable crowds at @entity79 ’s @entity78 to watch relocated @entity81 point to a healthy @entity83 appetite for rugby			0
yet the only @entity4 2015 venue that still has tickets available for all three of its matches is @entity90 ’s @entity89			1
nearby @entity91 , home to @entity92 , is a rugby stronghold that would surely have sold out by now , but tournament organisers deemed its off - field facilities unsuitable for a @entity4			2
meanwhile , @entity96 sold 200,000 tickets between november and @entity98 , suggesting a campaign promoting buying tickets as @entity98 presents proved successful			1
over 15,000 people were in attendance to see @entity81 win 41 - 16 at the @entity78 on sunday @entity104 have predictably taken up their option to extend their tv rights contract with the @entity107 until 2019			0
but this monopoly of live test cricket comes when two county chief executives , @entity112 ’s @entity111 and @entity114 ’s @entity113 , have gone public about the need for terrestrial tv exposure to arrest falling participation numbers and dwindling interest in domestic @entity119			0
@entity111 has expressed the need for @entity109 cricket to receive more exposure on terrestrial tv @entity126 drop @entity124 @entity132 , having lost their @entity127 and live @entity130 and @entity131 rights , will not be renewing the contracts of pundit @entity124 and presenter @entity134 at the end of the season			1
the decision was mutual with @entity124 , one of the best operators in the difficult role of co-commentator			1
he wants to work on live football and has offers from international broadcasters			0
however , shedding football personnel does n’t say much about @entity126 ’s ambitions to take @entity146 highlights off the @entity147 in the @entity149 tv rights auction next month			1
@entity124 ( right ) will be leaving his role as co-commentator at @entity126 at the end of the season @entity153 , @entity154 director and @entity0 candidate for @entity15 ’s @entity157 vice-presidency , prefers to conduct his football business away from the spotlight			1
so it ’s surprising @entity161 has agreed to talk about the contentious subject of third - party football ownership at a conference in @entity166 next week			0
@entity154 director @entity153 will be talking about third - party football ownership in @entity166 next week it has emerged @entity0 , who spent more than £ 2m on the flawed @entity173 website to highlight facilities nationwide , used web developers based in @entity176			2
however , this arrangement will cease when @entity173 — that was hardly used despite the massive cost — is merged soon with london 2012 legacy site be inspired			0
a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ lots of companies do this to keep costs down and get access to specific expertise			2

@entity0 will to bid to host the @entity23 under 17 championship
decision will be made by the @entity11 executive committee in @entity12 at the end of this month
elsewhere @entity124 is to leave @entity126 at the end of the season
presenter @entity134 will also be leaving the company
@entity200 2015 also sold 200,000 tickets between november and @entity98 for the @entity202 later this year
