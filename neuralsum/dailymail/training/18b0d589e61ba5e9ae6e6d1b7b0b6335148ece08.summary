first came the 3m tall kangaroos which were so big they were unable to hop like their modern - day cousins			1
now scientists believe they have discovered @entity4 , a giant wombat - like creature that was bigger than a small family car			1
at four metres long and 1.7 metres across the shoulders , the @entity7 was the largest marsupial of its time , weighing up to 2800 kilograms , when it roamed what is today known as @entity12 until they were wiped out about 25,000 years ago			1
another prehistoric super-sized creature was the giant marsupial lion , which was found across @entity12 and were even spotted soon after @entity29 settled @entity30			1
the thylacoleo carnifex had a wide , heavy , short - snouted skull with an extra long shearing tooth , according to @entity26			2
it grew to 1.5 metres long and 75 centimetres at the shoulder and weighed between 90 to 160 kilograms			0
the giant marsupial lion , called @entity36 had a wide , heavy , short - snouted skull with the longest shearing tooth and could grow up to 1.5 metres long scientists revealed new research that kangaroos are descended from giant ten - foot ( three metre tall ) creatures that were too heavy to hop			1
pictured taller than basketballer @entity43 who is 2.16 metres tall news of the giant creatures that roamed ancient @entity12 comes after scientists revealed new evidence that modern - day kangaroos are descended from giant 3m creatures that were too heavy to hop			1
it was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven - stone frame that they learned to bounce			2
professor @entity55 , from @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , said : ‘ i do n't think they could have gotten that large unless they were walking			2
’ the team , whose research was published in the journal @entity65 , analysed bones from more than 140 past and present kangaroo and wallaby skeletons , making nearly 100 measurements of each animal			0
unlike modern red and grey kangaroos , the giant animals called sthenurine kangaroos lacked specialised features enabling rapid hopping			1
their bone structure indicated they had an upright posture and were able to support their weight on one foot at a time			0
hop-less ! kangaroos are descended from giant ten - foot ( three metres ) creatures that were too heavy to hop , new research suggests			1
their extinct ancestors strode around the @entity12 outback 100,000 years ago , walking on two legs it was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven - stone frame that they learned to bounce			1
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity12 outback ( pictured ) large - bodied sthenurine kangaroos - a now extinct relative to modern - day kangaroos - first appeared in the middle @entity109 period and became extinct in the @entity110			1
they were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs			1
the largest of these kangaroos weighed around 38 stone ( 240kg ) - almost three times as much as a modern kangaroo			1
larger hip and knee joints , as well as more stable ankle joints , meant the large animals were more suited to walking			2
it was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven - stone frame that they learned to bounce			2
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity12 outback			1
the creatures had large hips and knees and stable ankle joints that would have helped them walk on two legs			2
their hands were poorly suited for moving on all fours , but adapted for foraging			0
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity12 outback			1
using elasticity in the tendons of their large legs to bounce is an effective , low - energy way to move at speed for long periods			1
but it only remains efficient if body weight remains low			0
the giant ancient kangaroos would simply have been too heavy , the scientists suggest			1
professor @entity55 said : ‘ people often interpret the behaviour of extinct animals as resembling that of the ones known today , but how would we interpret a giraffe or an elephant known only from the fossil record ? ‘ we need to consider that extinct animals may have been doing something different from any of the living forms , and the bony anatomy provides great clues			0
’ whether or not reliance on walking rather than faster and more efficient hopping led to the ancient kangaoroos becoming extinct is unknown			0
professor @entity55 said they may have struggled to elude human hunters , or been unable to migrate far enough to find food as the climate became more arid			1
in july , scientists from @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 in @entity180 discovered that a kangaroo ’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			2
' we found that when a kangaroo is walking , it uses its tail just like a leg , ' said associate professor @entity190 of @entity191 in in @entity179 , @entity180			0
‘ they use it to support , propel and power their motion			0
in fact , they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs			0
' ' what we did n't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing			2
it was pretty darn surprising , ’ said associate professor @entity207 at the @entity208			0
this summer , scientists discovered that a red kangaroo 's tail provides as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			2
the tail skeleton of a kangaoo is pictured right red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in @entity12			1
when grazing on grass , they move both hind feet forward ' paired limb ' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies			0
' they appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat , ' said professor @entity207			0
' but it turns out it is not really that awkward , just weird			0
' in human movement , the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake , which is not especially efficient , said professor @entity207			0
professor @entity190 said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg			0
‘ their tails have more than 20 vertebrae , taking on the role of our foot , calf , and thigh bones			0
' the kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders , then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction .			0

the hippopotamus - sized wombat was the largest marsupial known
the wombat 's ancestors lived to be the size of a @entity20
another super-size creature was the giant marsupial lion
while scientists revealed this week that the giant kangaroos were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs
modern kangaroos are thought to hop in order to efficiently cover the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity12 outback
