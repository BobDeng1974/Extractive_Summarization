@entity0 won their first @entity1 since 1992 in dramatic fashion , beating @entity3 9 - 8 on penalties			1
@entity5 smashed his spot - kick against the crossbar but the @entity8 recovered in the shoot - out , eventually taking the title when goalkeeper @entity11 saved from his opposite number @entity13 and then stepped up to score			1
it was an exciting end to a game that had been anything but , with @entity16 stars @entity5 and @entity17 unable to create enough to win the game in 90 , or even 120 minutes			1
however , once again , the @entity0 captain was less than the star we know he can be when played further forward			2
ahead of him @entity5 was even more frustrated , unable to get into the game and carrying none of the goal - threat that saw him become the @entity16 ’s top scorer in 2014			2
time after time @entity25 ’s newest striker failed to hold the ball , or to find a team - mate once he had got it under control			0
indeed , as has been the case for much of this season , the @entity25 stars were outshone for most of the game by a @entity97 counterpart			0
@entity40 , who has shown throughout this tournament why @entity99 made such an effort to secure him on loan this season , was the best player on the pitch for much of the game			0
his excellent play on the right wing brought most of @entity3 ’s attacking joy , most notably when he got in behind and crossed for captain @entity42 in the 70th minute , only for the former @entity108 striker to miss his kick			2
and it was @entity40 who came closest to finding the net during the 90 minutes which occasionally promised much but eventually delivered little			1
the @entity99 winger struck the post with a lovely dipping shot that had beaten @entity11 completely , but did n’t quite have enough bend to take it into the corner of the net			0
the black stars hit the upright again not long after , @entity38 getting in behind the defence and wrong - footing @entity11 , only to see his shot go behind off the frame of the goal			0
@entity17 ( centre ) celebrates having won the @entity1 with the @entity0 , following a penalty shoot - out win over @entity3 @entity0 captain and @entity129 star @entity17 is presented with the @entity1 trophy on sunday evening those near - misses aside , neither side looked much like breaking the deadlock			1
neither @entity11 , playing for the first time in the tournament in the absence of the injured @entity137 , nor @entity75 was forced to make too taxing a save , even as the game ticked into extra time			0
@entity42 missed his kick when well - placed , @entity32 saw a header go just wide , and @entity146 , off the bench to replace @entity145 ’s @entity144 , wasted a decent half chance for the @entity3			1
the elephants , for their part , were once again content to sit back and let @entity3 have the majority of possession , playing much of their best football on the break			2
@entity156 forward @entity155 ( right ) and @entity158 midfielder @entity157 deliver the @entity160 trophy @entity0 's @entity161 ( centre ) makes a high challenge on @entity3 's @entity36 during the @entity1 final on sunday evening @entity25 striker @entity5 fires towards goal as the @entity0 struggled to break down a resolute @entity3 side former @entity167 forward @entity63 attempts to keep possession for the favourites in the @entity1 final against @entity3 @entity63 was a menace from the start , running at defenders with the mix of skilful play and uncontrolled chaos that has become his speciality			1
the former @entity167 man , as is his way , rarely had much in the way of end product , but he was always a threat for the @entity184 defence			0
he really should have scored in the second period of extra time , but took a poor touch when he was through on goal			0
the one time that that @entity63 did pick the perfect pass the opportunity was spurned by @entity61 , the winger who once plied his trade for @entity192			0
following a dreadful mistake from @entity33 , @entity61 was played in on goal , only to blast over from 15 yards			0
@entity0 's @entity56 ( centre ) attempts an acrobatic overhead kick with the surrounding @entity3 defence watching on @entity0 and @entity25 talisman @entity17 drives forward under the attention of @entity3 's midfielder @entity37 it was the @entity201 ’ best chance in a game noticeable more for the three red cards that did n’t happen than for anything that did			1
@entity42 was the first beneficiary , when he stamped on @entity55 off the ball , unspotted by referee @entity74			2
@entity42 ’s team - mate @entity32 was equally lucky when he headbutted @entity55 in the second half , and @entity74 again failed to notice			1
a referee can only give what he sees , however , so both @entity209 incidents , though wrong , can be understood			0
how the official contrived to let @entity161 stay on the pitch , however , is another matter			0
there is no question he saw the kick to @entity36 ’s groin , which though not malicious was certainly painful for the @entity223 man , and prompted a yellow card			0
@entity0 coach @entity225 reacts as a decision goes against his side during the @entity1 final on sunday evening @entity3 's midfielder @entity38 ( right ) challenges @entity0 's midfielder @entity161 as their sides vie for the @entity1 2015 title he also awarded a free kick when the @entity0 midfield cynically chopped down @entity40 to stop an attack , but inexplicably decided it was not worthy of a second yellow card			1
it was the closest we came to drama at @entity29 until the shoot - out			1
but as the remnants of the @entity0 ‘ golden generation ’ now know , waiting a long time for success makes it all the sweeter			2
@entity3 's forward @entity42 ( right ) vies with @entity0 's midfielder @entity17 in the air during the @entity160 final @entity3 's midfielder @entity38 ( left ) speaks to @entity3 's coach @entity251 during the @entity160 final ahead of extra-time @entity25 striker @entity5 misses his penalty early on in the shoot - out , with his effort crashing off the woodwork @entity3 's goalkeeper @entity13 dives as he fails to save the winning penalty from @entity0 's goalkeeper @entity11 @entity0 's goalkeeper @entity11 scores the winning spot - kick before celebrating his team 's triumph on sunday @entity3 's midfielder @entity38 is comforted by his coach @entity251 at the end of the @entity160 final defeat @entity0 's head coach @entity225 ( centre ) celebrates and dances with his players after winning the @entity1			1

@entity3 's @entity32 appeared to headbutt @entity55 on the hour mark but was left *unpunished*
the match ended *goalless* after 90 minutes and went to extra-time to decide the eventual winner
however the teams remained in deadlock and the final was *contested* on penalties
the pair competed in a penalty shoot - out in the 1992 final as @entity0 won with *24* penalties taken and *21* scored
