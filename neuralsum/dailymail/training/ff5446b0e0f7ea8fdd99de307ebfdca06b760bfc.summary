@entity0 has divide between top eight and bottom 11 if you want to know why @entity3 was sacked , look at the table will @entity5 and @entity6 meet at @entity7 as equals ? by @entity9 @entity10 : 12:26 est , 27 december 2013 @entity11 : 12:56 est , 27 december 2013 a game of two halves ? now it ’s a table of two halves			1
@entity16 , in football , is not between north and south			1
it is the gap which separates those who might have been described by @entity20 as @entity21			1
the @entity22 and @entity23 : @entity25 's @entity24 ( left ) celebrates his second goal against @entity6 on @entity27 but the @entity6 ' @entity28 ( right ) despairs @entity29 of a difference : @entity31 ( second right ) celebrates but the @entity34 players hold their heads plenty to celebrate : @entity37 , led by @entity38 ( centre ) will challenge for the title there are now two divisions within the @entity0 : 1 ) a @entity43 comprised of the eight top clubs – the rich and the famous ; 2 ) a sub-division made up of the 11 teams all anxiously hunched within five points of relegation			1
marooned between them , in a @entity50 of neither great aspiration nor fearful desperation , are @entity53			2
@entity54 are six points behind them but the real void is the 10 points which separate the @entity58 from the @entity59			2
@entity59 are bringing up the rear of the major clubs but are still in a different league from those toiling below them , a league predicated on money and influence within the game			2
as we approach this weekend , the exact half - way point of the season , we know already that the title and @entity74 places will be shared among four from the top eight of @entity25 , @entity37 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity59			1
this , of course , is exactly what the @entity0 moguls had in mind – the executives as well as the bosses of the major clubs – when they broke away from the good old - fashioned @entity87			1
namely the power and the glory and the tv money to the big boys			2
witness this half - term @entity92 on @entity93 – @entity79 v @entity25 followed by @entity76 v @entity77			2
the irony – cleverly hidden behind all the glitzy hype and grasping propaganda about the self - proclaimed @entity99 in @entity100 - is that this has been achieved by a dumbing down of standards			2
switch off the rah - rah - rah television volume – either that or go to games which are more dead than live – and watch some of the basement brigade try to play football against each other			2
the great divide : there is a gap between the top eight ( above ) and the bottom 11 ( below ) unless you are a dyed - in - the - wool supporter of one of the clubs , you can lose the will to live			1
many of these matches are morasses of clumsy ball control , wayward passes , @entity125 tackles , lumbering movement and missed chances			2
empty seats at grounds around the country are reminders that you ca n’t fool all the people , all the time			2
and yet the @entity0 takes delight in pointing out that , on a given day , these teams can give the giants a run for their vast amounts of money			1
what that really tells us is that the good are not as great as they would have us believe			0
take the three dominant teams of recent seasons , none of whom are as impressive as they used to be			0
heavyweight battle : @entity76 's @entity149 ( left ) faces a @entity77 side featuring @entity151 and @entity152 ( right ) on ' @entity92 ' @entity80 , by their own admission , are in a flux of transition following the retirement of sir @entity158			0
@entity37 ’s indifferent away form , by common consensus , does not reflect their vast expenditure in the transfer market			0
@entity76 , by @entity164 ’s admission , are not the force they used to be			0
yet all are still up there			0
only @entity25 have maintained their level			0
consequently their flowing , if somewhat fragile , football has taken them to the top … and may keep them there			1
@entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 are also beneficiaries of the slippage above them – as well as the deficiencies below			0
this is not to say the second half of the season will be unexciting			0
down but not out : it 's tight at the bottom and both @entity184 's @entity183 and @entity185 , for who @entity186 ( right ) scored the winner , secured victories on @entity27 entertainment , more than quality , is the name of the @entity0 game and this division of the haves from the have - nots serves their purpose			1
it will be fascinating finding out if @entity199 can end the @entity25 trophy drought			0
and whether @entity78 or @entity79 can dislodge one or two of the @entity202 from @entity74 qualification			0
also , with so many teams hovering around the drop zone , the sub-division promises to be a cliff - hanger to the end			0
but as @entity20 wrote , @entity22 were privileged but not so lovely as they were made to appear			0
and of @entity23 11 , three are most certainly doomed			1
how the @entity0 has concentrated power into the hands of the richest few : this is how the table looked on @entity27 night in the year of the @entity0 ’s inception , 1992 , through key stages down the decades : shock leaders : @entity217 were top after @entity27 1992 and finished the first @entity0 season in third flying @entity217 : @entity220 ( left ) and @entity221 ( right ) were key players in that @entity217 side villans were heroes : @entity225 topped the table after @entity27 1998 main man : @entity228 was the star for @entity225 that season , especially in scoring this hat - trick against @entity25 united on top : sir @entity158 's men led after @entity27 but @entity25 won the title invincible : @entity234 and @entity25 were second after @entity27 but won the league and were unbeaten is it really such a surprise @entity3 has been sacked ? take a look at the table			1
@entity240 are one point above the @entity0 relegation places			1
of the four teams below them , @entity185 , @entity243 and @entity183 all changed managers - and all achieved improbable victories on @entity27			0
only @entity6 have stuck with their man			1
but although they lost on @entity27 and fell into the drop zone , to be brutally honest they looked more convincing against leaders @entity25 than @entity240 did against a middling @entity53			0
time 's up : @entity3 has been sacked by @entity240 ... but given their league position , is it such a surprise ? @entity3 did a near - miraculous job in bringing top - flight football back to @entity258			1
so while @entity240 ’s slide is being blamed on their weird - seeming @entity264 owner , @entity262 can get out with his reputation intact , a hefty pay - off and high prospects of immediate re-employment			0
it is , as football managers are so prone to saying , a result			0
can the day really be fast approaching when @entity5 , currently @entity271 leaders , will have the ironic pleasure of going to the @entity7 to play @entity6 , now in the @entity0 relegation places ? we @entity276 ’s fans are beginning to believe			1
not that we wish misfortune upon our blood brothers at @entity279			0
even better if we end up doing it in the @entity0 .			1

@entity0 has divide between top eight and bottom 11
if you want to know why @entity3 was sacked , look at the table
will @entity5 and @entity6 meet at @entity7 as equals ?
