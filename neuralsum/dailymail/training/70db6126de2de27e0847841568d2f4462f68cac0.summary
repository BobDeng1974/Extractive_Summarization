just as @entity1 would n't be complete without pumpkin carving or ghoulish decorations , it would n't be the same without @entity5 's now traditional prank on kids			2
the @entity8 host tricked unsuspecting youngsters across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their @entity1 candy			1
the results , which were caught on camera and shared a four - minute video , show kids kicking and screaming - and even swearing - at their chuckling parents			1
the video is part of @entity5 's annual prank on kids enraged : one little girl howls and then begins kicking her legs after learning there 's no candy left anger : two brothers break down in sobs - and continue to be mad even when their mother says it 's a joke one girl throws a monstrous fit - pushing over chairs , throwing plates and screaming - while another little boy refuses to believe his mother and turfs through kitchen drawers in search of his snacks			1
' get out , ' he scowls at her			0
others are simply in disbelief at how their parents could eat so much , with one asking : ' all of it ? every single bite ? you must have a bellyache			2
' but some of the children are understanding of their parents ' sweet teeth , and gently reassure them that it 's ok			1
in a show of kindness , one little boy lifts his hand to his mother as he insists ' it 's fine , it 's fine ' - before giving her a hug			0
make it stop ! one youngster can only shake his head and moan as his dad helps himself to his candy warning : a boy sobs , left , while another checks all the kitchen drawers and then tells his mom : ' get out ' fit : one girl throws a chair to the ground and then picks up a plate from a table and throws it on the floor oops : one girl does n't miss a beat after her dad says her candy is gone - and bombards him with expletives @entity5 first encouraged parents to trick their kids with the prank in 2011 and has been doing the same every year since			1
' we did it again this year and got more videos than ever before , ' the show explained on its @entity99 page			2
' we sifted through more than a thousand and whittled it down to our favorites			0
' at the end of the clip , @entity5 explained that if parents and their kids really did get too much candy , they could send it to the troops via @entity108 by november 15			1
' thanks to all the parents who participated - and apologies to the kids who participated as well , ' he said , laughing			2
in past years , some people have failed to find the prank funny			0
up to his usual tricks : @entity5 has pranked kids across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their @entity1 candy ' pranking your own children is not harmless fun , but is cruel and potentially damaging , ' @entity121 , a professor at @entity123 's department of psychological sciences , said last year			1
he questioned whether parents were looking out for the best interests of the child			0
but this year 's viewers were tickled by the video			0
' this has to be the funniest series on the internet ! its a pity its only once a year ! [ sic ] ' one wrote			0
another warned : ' one day , those kids will hunt you down @entity5			0

the @entity8 host pranked kids for the fourth year in a row
