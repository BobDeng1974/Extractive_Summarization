by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:55 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 15 may 2013 in the running : @entity3 is about to announce his campaign to be mayor of @entity6 @entity3 is about to announce that he will run to be mayor of @entity6 , it was reported today			1
the disgraced former congressman has been flirting with the idea of a political comeback ever since he re-emerged into the public eye earlier this year			2
now he is believed to have appointed a campaign manager , and will officially announce his candidacy within the next few days			1
mr @entity3 , 48 , was forced to resign as @entity16 congressman for a district in @entity18 in 2011 after it emerged that he had sent explicit pictures of himself to a 21 - year - old woman			1
over the past few months the @entity22 has conducted a series of interviews in a bid to rehabilitate his public image , and has long been suspected of harbouring an ambition to succeed @entity28 as mayor			0
one poll last month put mr @entity3 at second place among @entity6 voters , behind only the current favourite @entity33			1
now sources have confirmed that he will announce his candidacy before @entity36 on may 27 in order to meet the deadlines for filing election papers next month			0
' he 's definitely running , ' a friend told the @entity41 today			0
a major step towards confirming his candidacy came this month when mr @entity3 hired @entity45 as his campaign manager , according to @entity47			1
mr @entity45 is an experienced @entity48 operative who was involved with a congressional campaign in @entity50 ahead of last year 's elections			1
the candidate has also hired a press secretary and is moving to appoint staff to other key roles			0
couple : mr @entity3 is married @entity57 , who is one of the top aides to @entity59 mr @entity3 suffered a blow this week when it emerged that he will not attract the support of @entity62 and @entity59 , who have distanced themselves from him despite their friendship with his wife @entity57 , one of the top aides to the former secretary of state			2
' the @entity69 wish @entity3 would just disappear			2
every time he pops up , it ’s a reminder of @entity62 ’s scandal with @entity72 , and it is n’t helpful to @entity59 ’s hopes for 2016 , ' an unidentified @entity22 told the @entity41 's @entity74			0
the references to @entity72 will inevitably be a distraction if @entity59 decides to run as the @entity48 nominee for president in the next election , and since many consider her the party 's front runner , it is important for her to take steps to keep it that way			2
close : but mrs @entity59 and her husband are unlikely to support mr @entity3 's mayoral bid this year overlapping : @entity59 , seen here when she was a senator for @entity6 , worked with then - congressman @entity3 and knows him socially through her work with @entity57 mr @entity3 has been opening up publicly in the last month through a series of interviews to reintroduce himself to @entity6 , and in one of the profiles ms @entity57 told the @entity94 that mrs @entity59 was a major source of support for her when the scandal broke			1
' we ’ve had a lot of personal conversations , none of which i feel comfortable talking about			0
but what i will say about her , and for that matter her entire family , the unconditional love and support they have given me has been a real gift , ' she told the @entity94			0
it comes as little shock that ms @entity57 finds the former president a supportive friend as well , since he performed her wedding ceremony in 2010			0
the potential problems with a @entity3 campaign are effectively connected to how close ms @entity57 is with her longtime boss , who is now considered favourite to be the next @entity48 presidential nominee .			1

@entity3 will announce start of campaign within next few days , source says
has hired experienced @entity48 operative as his campaign manager
