@entity0 , who retired from the @entity1 last month , says authorities have no clear idea about immigrants in this country the newly - retired boss of @entity8 's @entity7 has admitted that immigration to this country was out of control under @entity12 and politicians have no idea ' who is here and who is n't '			1
@entity0 , who retired from the @entity18 last month , blamed the problem on a surge of illegal immigrants who came to the country between 2000 - 2003			1
he said : ' there was a huge influx and frankly i do n't think we have ever recovered from that '			1
speaking as ministers attempted to tackle a backlog of 750,000 cases , mr @entity0 said the problem began over a decade ago when immigrants flooded in			1
he said that after they arrived , many then changed their names and were now undetectable by authorities			0
in a forthright newspaper interview today , mr @entity0 , who was awarded the @entity36 this year for the work he did on security at last summer 's @entity39 , said it was difficult for border officials to cope with such a huge influx of people , adding : ' there 's little you can do other than take their details and pass them on			1
' his candid comments come days after home secretary @entity51 killed off the @entity7 after five years of catastrophic failure			2
the agency behind a string of immigration scandals was cut in two and brought under @entity57 control as mrs may condemned the agency , set up under @entity12 , as suffering from a ' closed , secretive and defensive culture '			2
former @entity1 chief @entity0 said immigration was out of control under @entity12 between 2000 - 2003 the home secretary said the enormous backlog of 320,000 cases would take 24 years to clear			1
in today 's interview with @entity67 , mr @entity0 said the immigration problems could have been avoided with the introduction of @entity71 cards and passport finger - printing			1
he said mrs may 's changes , which involve the @entity7 being split into two organisations , one to deal with visas and the other to track down illegal immigrants , would help combat the problem			2
the @entity1 was created in 2008 to replace the @entity79 in the @entity57 , a department which was already in chaos , with asylum claims piling up , and staff badly demoralised			0
former head of the @entity84 , left , was removed by home secretary @entity51 , right , last year at one point 100,000 letters were found to be unopened and some 14,000 applicants had already been refused the right to stay but were still pleading with the @entity1 to reconsider			1
in 2011 mrs may removed @entity84 , the @entity7 's head , after discovering that @entity8 's passport checks had been removed without sanction			1
and she finally killed the @entity7 off last month after five years of failure under @entity92 , the mandarin who led the @entity1 from its inception			2
despite the crisis after crisis that typified the @entity1 under her control , ms @entity92 has now gone to a £ 180,000 - a - year role with @entity100			2
in an unprecedented speech in the @entity102 last month , mrs may laid the blame for the agency ’s failings firmly at @entity12 ’s door , saying it was unable to cope with the number of migrants admitted by the last government			2
she indicated she would pass new laws to remove illegal immigrants and foreign criminals from @entity8			2
mrs may told @entity114 : ' @entity1 was given @entity7 status to keep its work at an arm ’s length from ministers			0
it created a closed , secretive and defensive culture			0
’ on april 1 , the @entity1 was divided into two sections , one to deal with immigration visas and one to deal with immigration law enforcement			0
tip of the iceberg : illegal immigrants sleeping rough in a camp under the @entity130 near @entity131 mrs may said the latter department would have ' law enforcement at its heart and get tough on those who break our immigration laws '			0
she said she was returning responsibility for controlling immigration to the heart of the @entity57 after a backlog of 300,000 immigration cases built up which would take 24 years to work through			0
her no - nonsense moves came after a scathing report by the @entity145 which revealed ministers had not been given correct information about the scale of the problem for years and accused the @entity7 of incompetence and foot - dragging			1
last year it emerged that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to stay here without proper checks after their cases were put into storage and little or no effort made to trace the individuals concerned			0
a government inspector discovered that some 124,000 cases were put on one side , of whom it later emerged that 37,500 people could have been easily located and potentially expelled from the country			0
the now - defunct @entity1 was typified for a stream of crises in which thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to remain here a further 10,000 cases classified as having ‘ legal barriers to removal ’ had , in fact , just never been opened			0
officials also repeatedly misled @entity177 over what was happening , according to @entity179 , the chief inspector of @entity180			0
other scandals at the @entity7 included half a million people travelling by @entity184 let in without being checked against a list of murderers and terrorists , expensive biometric passport machinery turned off on 15,000 occasions , and students waved through without their visas being examined			0
@entity0 was appointed director general of the @entity18 in september 2012 after ensuring the @entity39 passed by trouble - free			1
he had already had a career at the @entity57 spanning several decades , having served as head of ports and borders in both @entity196 ( 2000 - 03 ) and the @entity8 ( 2005 - 07 )			1
in 2007 he became the first regional director for the @entity1 in @entity198 and the @entity199 , and in 2010 he was appointed the first full - time senior responsible owner for the @entity201			0
last year mr @entity0 became the joint @entity202 for the @entity39			1
after his retirement last month , he became a consultant on global border security issues .			0

*ex-ukba* head @entity0 blames *massive* influx under @entity12 in 2000 - 2003
he says @entity8 has ' never recovered ' from chaos when 100,000 came each year
@entity0 says *scrapping* the *shambolic* @entity7 and splitting it into two will help tackle the issue
