a collection of around 500 fairytales left forgotten in an archive for more than 150 years have been discovered in @entity3			1
the stories - written around the same time as the @entity6 folk tales - offer a new selection of entrapped princesses , evil witches and dashing young princes			2
historian @entity11 gathered the unique collection of stories in the 1800s from across the @entity16 region of @entity17 in @entity3			1
the fairytales were collected by historian @entity19 in the 1800s - around the same time the @entity6 were writing tales such as the @entity21 , shown in a sketch by @entity23 in 1829 many of the tales were told to him by local country folk , labourers and servants which had previously only been passed on through the generations by word of mouth			1
he completed a book on his findings called @entity34 der @entity17 – @entity35 , which came out in three volumes in 1857 , 1858 and 1859 , which included the fairy tales and historical background on them			1
in 1885 , @entity40 said this about him : ' nowhere in the whole of @entity3 is anyone collecting [ folklore ] so accurately , thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear			2
' but his book never gained prominence and faded into obscurity			2
it was only when @entity17 cultural curator @entity51 was sifting through his work which had been stored in an archive in @entity54 , @entity3 , for 150 years , that his work re-emerged into the public domain			1
ms @entity51 has now published a selection of fairytales from @entity61 's collection , the @entity57 reports			1
the book is called @entity63 - meaning ' scarab beetle ' which is better known in @entity65 as a ' dung beetle '			0
legends : @entity68 's collection has never - heard - before tales but also more well - known stories like @entity6 's @entity71 , depicted in a drawing by @entity73 ms @entity51 chose the beetle because it buries its most treasured possession - its eggs - which she says is symbolic of the hidden knowledge and wisdom to be found in fairytales			1
many of the fairytales in the collection had been completely lost to the public consciousness until now			2
one story tells of a maiden who escapes a witch by transforming herself into a pond			0
the witch then lies on her stomach and drinks all the water , swallowing the young girl			0
but once she has drunk the pond , the girl uses a knife to cut her way out of the witch			0
ther are also more well - known but local examples of tales such as @entity102 and @entity103			0
ms @entity51 says the fairytales were invented for people of all ages			0
she said : ' their main purpose was to help young adults on their path to adulthood , showing them that dangers and challenges can be overcome through virtue , prudence and courage			0
' ms @entity51 helped to found the @entity116 , an interdisciplinary committee devoted to analysing his work and publicising it .			0

many were passed from generation to generation by word of mouth in the @entity16 region of @entity17 in @entity3
