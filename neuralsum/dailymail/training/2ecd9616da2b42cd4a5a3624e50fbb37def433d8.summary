he 's no stranger to selfies and has even posted a tweet but prince @entity3 revealed that he ' hates ' twitter while meeting teenagers in @entity7 today			1
the prince was at @entity8 in east @entity7 , where he was introduced to the 60 ' digital media champions ' lined up to help promote september 's @entity10			1
but the royal admitted candidly : ‘ i really quite hate @entity4 ' as he took the opportunity to hit out at the social networking site for what he sees as its ‘ invasion ’ of his privacy during an impromptu q&a			2
' the issue for myself and my family , put quite simply , is that it 's very hard for me to tweet about the @entity10 and tweet about something that means a lot to me , whereas i at the same time really quite hate @entity4 by the invasion of privacy			2
i think you all understand what i 'm talking about			0
’ although @entity39 and @entity40 both use social media to promote the work of the @entity43 , @entity3 , who is fourth in line to the throne , has often spoken of his anger at the way details or pictures of his whereabouts outside of official engagements are made public on the internet			1
but it seems that not all social media is off limits , as during the visit , he admitted that he once had a @entity59 account – for which he used the pseudonym @entity62			0
enjoying himself : prince @entity3 was on cheerful form as he told of his hopes for september 's @entity10 friendly chat : despite his dislike of social media , @entity3 hopes the ' digital champions ' will help spread the word @entity3 was meeting 60 students from six @entity7 schools taking classes at @entity8 on how to @entity4 and use @entity59 and other websites as they prepare to become ‘ digital champions ’ for the @entity10			1
the prince has spearheaded the event , which will be held between september 10th and 14th at the @entity78 , and will see 400 wounded servicemen and women from 14 countries compete in everything from volleyball to archery			0
speaking off the cuff , @entity3 told his audience : ‘ for me this is an opportunity for the @entity91 public to say thank you to these people from across the world for their service			2
you only hear about the guys who die , you never hear about the injuries			0
‘ so to give this opportunity to all these guys who have been injured and managed to survive thanks to the amazing medical care we have nowadays , i think that 's a really powerful message to send to everybody			0
some of them should n't be alive but they are			0
’ snap happy : a student at @entity8 films @entity3 as he tells teens about the @entity10 he told the students how he was inspired by the @entity109 , a similar event held in the @entity111 , during a visit to @entity113 in 2012 and vowed to make their concept global			1
since then he has immobilised the @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity118 organisers to throw their weight behind the event			0
during the very relaxed visit @entity3 sat in on three workshops at the school , at one point even taking over and asking the young people questions about why they like social media			1
he posed for photographs with several of the students and encouraged them to ‘ get out of the classroom ’ to take pictures and tweet from @entity118 locations			0
after the event - and despite his disdain for the site - photos of prince @entity3 flooded onto @entity4 , with students telling of their delight at meeting him			1
no escape : prince @entity3 was the subject of a series of delighted selfies , including this from @entity143 popular : this twitpic of prince @entity3 also appeared on the site as his ' digital champions ' got to work one , @entity143 , who describes himself as a ' passionate @entity148 fan and a fan of sport in general , ' tweeted : ' @entity151 prince @entity3			1
@entity153 training to be a # @entity154 social media ambassador ! ' even the teachers could n't resist getting in on the act with the staff at one sixth form college , sir @entity159 in @entity160 , writing : ' so proud of our students ... you were fantastic as usual ! ! thank you @ @entity164 and # @entity165 ' .			2
