a while ago , i visited a @entity2 nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year			1
it was like a slow - motion factory ; tissue - cultured plantlets came in at one end , flowering specimens trundled out of the other , each in a posh ceramic pot. orchids , particularly @entity14 ( moth orchids ) , have become @entity16 's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks			1
moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and , with care , they can flourish for years			1
but it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs			1
@entity28 beauty : moth orchids ( pictured ) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms more than 22,000 species of orchids make up @entity34 , the world 's largest flowering plant family			1
about 50 are native to @entity16 , and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow			1
with such a huge range of habitats , orchids ' needs differ widely			1
but once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids , it 's not hard to keep them happy			1
@entity49 @entity14 , like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes , meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees			1
they subsist on rain or mist , and nourishment comes from debris lodging in the tree bark , so their sparse roots are as important for clinging on as for absorbing nutrients			2
in a pot in your house , the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest			1
that means a minimum 16 degrees @entity70 ambience , humidity and good light			2
to boost humidity in spring and summer spray rainwater on to the leaves from an atomiser ( if possible always use rainwater warmed to room temperature )			2
in winter , move your orchid closer to an east or west - facing window and the extra light will encourage flowering			0
the commonest cause of death is overwatering			0
to avoid that , imagine the orchid perched up a tree , soaked by rain from time to time but drying out in between			0
cram the roots into wet compost and it will die			1
that is why it is best to grow epiphytes in slatted containers or transparent , perforated orchid pots and to allow the prehensile roots to poke into the air			0
during the growing season , feed monthly with special orchid feed			0
but in winter , reduce watering and do not feed			0
@entity105 - @entity104 phalaenopsis should last for about three months but , when they fade , you can persuade the old stem to sprout again			0
feel it carefully for swellings ( nodes ) near the base			0
if you cut the stem just above the second node from the base , a new flower spike should develop			0
repot your orchid only if it has become pot - bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years			1
do that when the pale roots develop green tips ; a sign the plant is ready to repot			2
use special epiphytic orchid compost â€” it will appear coarse and lumpy and is available at good garden centres			0
remove any dead or shrivelled roots , shorten the remaining healthy ones to about 12cm and replant the orchid in the same size pot. pack the compost in firmly for stability and allow any upward - facing roots to grow out over the container 's sides			2
water thoroughly , making sure all the compost is moist and that the water drains away easily			0
next year , when the repotting has worked and you are flush with success , start looking for different orchids			2
the number of new varieties introduced each year beggars belief			0
