the @entity0 , the largest stealth destroyer ever built for the @entity2 , was launched into the waters of the @entity4 in @entity5 for the first time on monday			1
the big ship touched water without fanfare after a ceremony scheduled was earlier this month was canceled due to the partial federal government shutdown			1
dozens of local residents gathered to watch the hours - long process of floating the ship in a dry dock			2
in the water for the first time , the ship was a sight to behold			2
the first - in - class @entity21 , the largest @entity2 destroyer ever built , floats off a submerged dry dock in the @entity4 , on monday the @entity21 looks like no other @entity25 warship , with an angular profile and clean carbon fiber superstructure that hides antennas and radar masts ‘ it 's absolutely massive			1
it 's higher than the tree line on the other side			0
it 's an absolutely huge ship - very imposing			2
it 's massively dominating the waterfront , ’ said @entity35 , executive director of the @entity36 , who watched the process from her office down river from the shipyard			0
the @entity21 looks like no other @entity25 warship , with an angular profile and clean carbon fiber superstructure that hides antennas and radar masts			1
‘ the @entity21 is really in a league of its own , ’ said defense consultant @entity47 , author of the ‘ the @entity48 to @entity49			0
’ workers at @entity53 , part of @entity55 , will continue working on the ship throughout the winter			2
the shipyard hopes to hold a rescheduled christening in the spring , with sea trials following in the fall			1
@entity53 plans to deliver the ship to the @entity2 in 2015			1
like a giant nose , the forward hull body of the first - in - class @entity21 , the largest @entity2 destroyer ever built , juts out of its dry dock in @entity53 , @entity5 in action : an artist rendering of the @entity69 which will be one of the more heavily armed and expensive ships in the @entity2 originally envisioned as a ‘ stealth destroyer , ’ the @entity21 has a low - slung appearance and angles that deflect radar			1
its wave - piercing hull aims for a smoother ride			0
the 610 - foot ship is a behemoth that 's longer and bigger than the current class of destroyers			2
it was originally designed for shore bombardment and features a 155mm ‘ @entity88 ’ that fires rocket - propelled warheads that have a range of nearly 100 miles			2
thanks to computers and automation , it will have only about half the complement of sailors as the current generation of destroyers			0
critics , however , felt the @entity2 was trying to incorporate too much new technology - a new hull , computer automation , electric propulsion , new radar and new gun - into one package			1
at one point , the program was nearly scrapped because of growing cost			0
eventually , the program was truncated to three ships , the @entity21 being the first			0
the first - in - class @entity21 features an unusual wave - piercing hull , electric drive propulsion , advanced sonar and guided missiles , and a new gun that fires rocket - propelled warheads as far as 100 miles @entity53 hopes to hold a rescheduled christening in the spring and plans to deliver the ship to the @entity2 in 2015 with its fearsome array of weapons , radar evading silhouette and $ 7billion price tag , this is one of @entity25 's most deadly - and expensive - warships ever			1
equipped with guns capable of firing warheads 100 miles , stealth features , and engine able to generate enough power to run 78,000 homes , the @entity2 is hoping it with guarantee its naval supremacy for decades to come			1
after embarrassing troubles with its latest class of surface warships , the @entity2 is hoping for a winner from a new destroyer that 's ready to go into the water			1
so far , construction of the first - in - class @entity21 , is on time and on budget , something that 's a rarity in new defense programs , officials said			0
the christening of the ship bearing the name of the late admiral @entity21 was canceled earlier this month because of the federal government shutdown			1
fearsome : the $ 7billion first - in - class @entity21 rises from the dry docks in @entity53 in @entity151 , @entity5 hulking : first - in - class @entity0 is the largest @entity2 destroyer ever built the public christening ceremony featuring @entity21 's two daughters will be rescheduled for the spring			1
admiral @entity21 served in destroyers during @entity158 and was awarded a @entity159 for valor at the @entity161			0
as the nation 's youngest chief of naval operations , appointed at age 49 by president @entity166 , he fought to end racial discrimination and allowed women to serve on ships for the first time			2
like its namesake , the ship is innovative			2
it is so big that @entity53 built a 106 - foot - tall , $ 40 million ' @entity174 ' to accommodate its large hull segments			0
the ship is 100 feet longer than the existing class of destroyers			0
it features an unusual wave - piercing hull , electric drive propulsion , advanced sonar and guided missiles , and a new gun that fires rocket - propelled warheads as far as 100 miles			0
unlike warships with towering radar - and antenna - laden superstructures , the @entity21 will ride low to the water to minimize its radar signature , making it stealthier than others			0
deadly force : armed with up to 80 @entity195 cruise missiles and designed to back up @entity196 on amphibious missions the @entity0 is so expensive only three will be built resembling a 19th century ironclad warship the @entity0 uses a 21st century version of a ' tumblehome ' hull displacement : 14,564 long tons ( 14,798 t ) length : 600 ft ( 180 m ) @entity206 : 80.7 ft ( 24.6 m ) draft : 27.6 ft ( 8.4 m ) propulsion : two @entity210 gas turbines driving @entity212 generators and emergency diesel generators , 78 mw ( 105,000 shp ) ; two propellers driven by electric motors speed : over 30 kn ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) weapons : 20 × @entity219 vls modules , with a total of 80 launch cells @entity222 ( @entity222 ) , four per cell @entity224 , one per cell vertical @entity227 ( @entity226 ) , one per cell two × 155 mm / 62 caliber @entity88 920 × 155 mm rounds total ; 600 in automated store with @entity232 room with up to 320 rounds ( non-automatic ) as of april 2005 70 – 100 @entity234 rounds planned as of 2005 of total two × mk 110 57 mm gun ( @entity237 ) originally envisioned for shore bombardment , the ship 's size and power plant that can produce 78 megawatts of electricity - enough to power 78,000 homes - make it a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun , which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound			1
there are so many computers and so much automation that it 'll need fewer sailors , operating with a crew of 158 , nearly half the complement aboard the current generation of destroyers			0
' the concept of the @entity21 is sort of a bridge between the traditions of the past and the new world of networked warfare and precision guided munitions , ' said @entity270 , defense analyst at the @entity271			0
' it 's not so much a radical concept as it is an attempt to pull off a full range of missions with a ship that has one foot in the present and one foot in the future			0
' the @entity2 once envisioned building more than 20 of the ships			1
but the ship has so many sophisticated features and its cost grew so high that senior @entity2 officials tried to kill the program			1
instead , it was truncated to just three ships , the first being @entity21			0
the @entity21 will cost more than $ 3.5 billion - about three times that of current destroyers - but the program has not been beset by big cost overruns or delays , officials said			0
the fact that construction has gone smoothly is a relief for the @entity2 , which has dealt with embarrassing troubles on its new class of speedy warship , dubbed the ' littoral combat ship			1
' those smaller ships , designed to operate close to shore in littoral waters , have been plagued by escalating costs , production delays and mechanical problems			2
what you get for $ 7 billion dollars : a guide to the @entity0 's unique features a model of the @entity313 destroyer to be built by @entity53 and @entity314 is displayed during a contract signing ceremony at the @entity316 mission modules that give them the flexibility to perform roles including anti-submarine warfare and minesweeping are not ready , even though the first ships have been commissioned			1
' that ship is a total disaster , ' said @entity326 , a naval historian , analyst and author			2
against that backdrop , shipbuilders at @entity53 have been toiling away on the @entity0 , the first entirely new ship built on the banks of the @entity4 since the original @entity333 was christened more than 20 years ago			1
@entity334 , president of @entity335 , which represents 3,200 shipbuilders , said it 's been a challenging project with a new hull design , composite materials and new technology			0
' it is a radical departure from what we 've known			0
whether the @entity2 is satisfied with the design of the ship is up to them			1
we can only build what they asked for , ' he said , adding , ' i hope they 'll be pleased with it			0
we 'd like to build as many of them as we can			0
' the keel plate for the @entity357 the destroyers will be a new class of multi-mission @entity2 surface combatant ship designed to operate as part of a joint maritime fleet			1

@entity0 launched into the waters of the @entity4 in @entity5 on monday
little fanfare as official ceremony was canceled due to government shutdown
christening rescheduled for the spring , but the ship wo *n’t* be delivered to the @entity2 until 2015
looks like no other warship with angular profile and clean carbon fiber superstructure that hides antennas and radar masts
designed to maintain @entity25 naval supremacy for decades to come
