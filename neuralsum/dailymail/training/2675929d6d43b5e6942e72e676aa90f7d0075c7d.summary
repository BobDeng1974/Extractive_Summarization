@entity2 ' super-storms ' pose a ' catastrophic ' and ' long - lasting ' threat to life on @entity5 , a scientist has warned			2
these huge storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun and are accompanied by coronal mass ejections , or @entity11			1
cmes are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun ’s surface into space			1
a solar eruption could take out the @entity25 , along with many electrical systems across the world they are often preceded by a solar flare - a massive release of energy from the sun in the form of gamma rays , x-rays , protons and electrons			2
a solar superstorm occurs when a @entity12 of sufficient magnitude tears into the @entity5 ’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart			2
such an event would induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines , causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components			1
@entity49 , who was a member of an international task force - dubbed @entity51 - set up to identify the risks of a solar storm and how its impact could be minimised , warned of the danger man faces from ' solar super-storms			1
' a solar superstorm occurs when a @entity12 of sufficient magnitude tears into the @entity5 ’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart mr @entity49 , carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at @entity62 , said it is only a ' matter of time ' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards @entity5			1
he says such a storm would wreak havoc with communication systems and power supplies , crippling vital services such as transport , sanitation and medicine			0
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity5 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			2
' without power , people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations , get money from cash dispensers or pay online , ' he said			0
' @entity108 and sewage systems would be affected too , meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip , with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning			0
' the largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the @entity118 , named after the @entity120 astronomer @entity119 who spotted the preceding solar flare			0
this massive @entity12 released about 1022 kj of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion @entity125 bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the @entity5 at speeds of up to 3000 km / s. however , its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles ( 200,000 km ) of telegraph lines			1
mr @entity49 makes it clear in the latest issue of @entity136 that these types of events are not just a threat , but inevitable			1
@entity141 scientists have predicted that the @entity5 is in the path of a @entity119 - level event every 150 years on average			2
this means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent			0
this image of a huge solar flare ( top left ) was captured by the @entity152 ( @entity152 )			0
one of the most dramatic features is the way the entire surface of the sun seems to ripple with the force of the eruption the 40 - strong international team of scientists from @entity51 gathered at the @entity161 in @entity162 last year to identify the best ways of limiting the potential damage of a solar super-storm			1
a sub-group of scientists concluded that advanced space - weather forecasting is the best solution , which could be achieved by sending an array of 16 lunchbox - sized cube satellites into orbit around the @entity2 the network could give around a week ’s notice of where , when and with what magnitude solar storms will take place , providing adequate time to switch off vulnerable power lines , re-orientate satellites , ground planes and begin national recovery programmes			1
mr @entity49 ’s own solution is to design spacecraft and satellites so that the sensitive , on - board instruments are better protected again sudden increases in radiation from solar storms			1
he suggests redistributing the existing internal architecture of a craft so that sensitive payloads are surrounded by non-sensitive bulk material such as polyethylene , aluminium and water			0
mr @entity49 added : ' as a species , we have never been more vulnerable to the volatile mood of our nearest star , but it is well within our ability , skill and expertise as humans to protect ourselves			1

huge storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun
they can induce surges of electrical currents in the ground on @entity5
a storm can also affect overhead transmission lines causing a black out
warning comes from , @entity49 , a member of the @entity51 task force
@entity51 was set up to find out how to reduce the impact of solar storms
mr @entity49 says it is only a ' matter of time ' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards @entity5
