' on our return to the car i found a parking ticket on the windscreen and found my ticket on the floor just under the driver 's seat			1
not backing down : @entity68 have insisted they followed the correct procedures and made the ' appropriate decision ' ' as this was an unfortunate occurrence i assumed it would be cleared up by us sending a letter and the actual ticket to @entity39 council explaining what had happened , which i did			2
