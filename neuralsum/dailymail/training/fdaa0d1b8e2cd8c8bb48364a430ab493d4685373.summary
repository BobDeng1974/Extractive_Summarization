@entity0 believes @entity2 ’s comeback second behind dodging bullets at @entity4 on saturday has left the gelding with a ‘ realistic ’ chance of winning back his @entity8 crown at the @entity9 on march 11			1
the @entity11 trainer , who felt the exacting pace in the @entity13 set by eventual fourth @entity14 ultimately took its toll on a gelding racing for the first time in 13 months , also insists he is not unduly concerned by the ‘ low level bleed ’ detected from the nine - year - old ’s nostrils under veterinary examination while being routinely tested in the immediate aftermath of the race			0
@entity0 said : ‘ we could do without it but it is something we can live with			2
if you looked at him this morning you would not see anything or know it had happened			0
@entity2 recuperated from a heart problem to make comeback at @entity4 on saturday ‘ there was no mucus , which was important			1
’ @entity2 , who has recuperated from a heart problem , now heads straight to the @entity9 as 3 - 1 joint favourite for the @entity41 with sponsors @entity42 , bracketed with recuperating reigning champion @entity44 who is due to make his return to action in the @entity38 at @entity39 on february 7			1
@entity0 added : ‘ if you look at the time of the race it confirms @entity49 ( @entity50 on @entity14 ) went a really good gallop			1
there was no hiding place and no chance of having a breather even for a few strides			0
@entity0 is confident @entity2 has nearly fully recovered from heart problem ‘ there was that moment turning in when you just thought a miracle was going to happen but his legs turned to jelly			1
he 's had a fairly intense build - up , which is why he was more than 80 per cent fit			1
he was probably nearer 90 per cent			2
i think it 's realistic for him to regain his crown at @entity9			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 ’s @entity69 winner @entity70 has been ruled out for the season after injuries sustained in the spring			0
trainer @entity73 blamed a ‘ little muscle problem ’ for the defeat of @entity75 at @entity76 as the @entity77 ’ @entity79 winner got back on the successful chasing trail with a bloodless victory at @entity82			0
@entity86 - trained @entity85 winner @entity84 could return to the track for the @entity89 @entity88 on february 8 while the feature @entity91 was won by @entity92 , trained by @entity93 and ridden by @entity95 - based @entity94 .			0
