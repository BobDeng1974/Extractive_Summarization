@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts his side can not afford not to turn up in another big game if their top - four ambitions are to survive			1
prior to the international break the @entity8 ' 13 - match unbeaten league run was ended at home to @entity12 - chasing rivals @entity11 , leaving them five points adrift of the qualification places			1
defeat at third - placed @entity16 would be a huge blow to their aspirations of returning to @entity21 's elite for a second successive season			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 has urged his team to perform well in the clash with @entity16 on saturday @entity0 knows they must avoid a repeat of the disappointing first - half display against @entity11 which led to their defeat			1
' we 've made it difficult for ourselves because of our last performance and result , but it 's certainly achievable , ' he said of their top - four chances			0
' over the course of the last three months , apart from the last game , we 've performed very well and we have got results			0
' i think people might look at it ( the trip to @entity16 ) as a must - win game			2
for me , it is a must - perform game , we want to perform well and we know that when we do that we 've got every chance of winning , whether that 's at home or away			0
@entity0 watches over training as he prepares his side to face @entity16 at the @entity49 on saturday the @entity1 boss addresses his players ahead of the pivotal clash with @entity16 in @entity53 ' we 've had a long two weeks , it 's probably one of the few games where after the international break we 've had to suffer a little bit , because we did n't perform and lost , but there is extra motivation there to get something from the game and that is something that we clearly want to achieve			1
' these final eight games are going to be exciting games and there is still every possibility for us to make the top four			0
' many see the two sides as being similar in their approach to how they play , particularly in relation to how they like to keep the ball			0
that was a feature missing in the @entity11 game and it cost them dearly and @entity0 has spent a fortnight over the international break assessing where it went wrong after enjoying so much success in the previous three months			1
' our possession was n't good enough in our last game , ' he added			0
@entity1 captain @entity87 is suspended having been sent off against @entity11 ' the key for us in the first - half against @entity11 was that we did n't keep the ball well enough and , positionally , we were never in position to receive the ball and press the ball			1
' we 've talked about that , we 've analysed that and we 've worked on that ; in order for us to maximise how we 've been working we need to keep the ball better and be technically better			0
' that 's a huge part of our game , and it 's @entity16 's game			0
but for us , we 'll go there and tactically we are very clear on the idea of the game and we need to get something from the game , that 's clear			0
' but that was the same before we played the @entity11 game ; @entity16 was a game that we wanted to ensure that we got at least a point from and that will be the case at the weekend			2
' @entity114 trained on thursday ahead of @entity1 's trip to @entity16 in the @entity116 ' we 'll be going there looking forward to the game and really motivated to get back to winning again			1
' @entity1 have been boosted by striker @entity114 's return to training after a hip injury , while fellow @entity123 international @entity122 is also expected to be fit after pulling out of @entity125 's squad			2
however , they will be missing centre - back @entity126 , a virtual ever - present in the league this season , as he begins a three - match suspension alongside captain @entity87 .			1

@entity126 and @entity87 are suspended for the pivotal clash
