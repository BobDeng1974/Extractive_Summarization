it is often said that the greatest leaders are those who can delegate responsibility			2
prime ministers , presidents and world leaders have all spoken through history of the effectiveness of spreading the burden of power amongst the right people			2
this is an approach which @entity12 is adopting as @entity14 manager by handing extra responsibility to @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to act as ' unit leaders ' among his squad			1
@entity14 boss @entity12 has created ' unit leaders ' within his squad to improve performances the @entity14 manager is trying something different in the wake of a diabolical @entity25 in @entity26 and the need to reignite the national mood around the team			1
@entity12 has set up ' unit meetings ' – split into attack , midfield and defence – in an attempt to get his team animated			1
striker @entity16 , midfielder @entity17 and defender @entity18 have been handed the responsibility of galvanising their respective groups			1
in these meetings @entity14 coaches play videos of matches and training to talk players through how they can improve , but it is no longer a one - way process			1
@entity12 ( left ) has appointed striker @entity16 ( right ) as his attack ' unit leader ' in the @entity14 squad ' there are three units , ' @entity12 explained ahead of @entity54 qualifiers against @entity55 and @entity56 next week			1
' we 're trying to encourage players to take responsibility , to take ownership of their performances and to speak out			0
' so the meetings are n't just the coaches with their videos and their principles telling the players this is it , this is what we expect you to do			0
' we 're asking them to stand up themselves and make certain , so when we leave the meeting we know the players have understood everything completely , that there 's no chance they 've sat there quietly listening to us , nodding their heads wisely but not fully certain of what 's required			0
' this is a far cry from the scene set by @entity84 when he claimed that @entity14 players were ' treated like complete babies ' in the launch of his new book last week			2
@entity17 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) have been named midfield and defence ' unit leaders ' @entity12 pointed out that the @entity93 defender had never been a part of any of his squads since he took charge two - and - a - half years ago			1
and this is very much @entity12 empowering his players to stand up and be counted			2
' in each of the groups i 've asked people like @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity17 to make certain they animate the group , that they prod people , ' @entity12 added			1
' we 'll prod , the coaches , but i 've always prodded in every team meeting i 've done			0
i 've always asked for questions , but often you do n't get a response			0
' i 'm asking for the prodding to come from the players themselves where one of them will turn round to the group and say , ' look , what do you think ? do you understand ? is the message clear to you ? do you really now understand what 's required ? ' ' get people to speak , that 's what it 's all about			0
' @entity12 ( right ) has been quick to defend questions about @entity14 captain @entity124 's ( left ) at the head of them all is captain @entity124			1
his temperament and ability to lead the national team has been questioned since he was sent off for kicking @entity131 in @entity133 's match against @entity134 last weekend			1
but @entity12 insisted : ' if someone wants to write that @entity124 has n't got the temperament i ca n't stop them doing it			2
all i can tell you is : they are wrong			0
' i am happy with @entity124 , i am happy with the role he is playing , i am happy with the responsibility he is taking , and i think the other players are too			0
' he is filling big boots			0
not just of @entity149 , he has played in teams with different captains before him and many of them were top men			0
' @entity124 ( centre ) was sent off in @entity133 's 2 - 1 win against @entity134 last weekend @entity124 ( right ) was sent off for kicking out at @entity131 in their @entity156 encounter last week @entity12 added : ' the great thing with @entity124 as it was with @entity158 , is the passion they have for football , for their country , and for their clubs – both were basically one - club men if you take @entity124 leaving @entity166 at a young age			1
' they can transmit that passion to a lot of the younger players			0
they can get their points across			0

@entity12 has named @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity17 as his ' unit leaders ' among his @entity14 squad
@entity12 has named the trio as ' leaders ' to galvanise their national team - mates in their respective positions of defence , midfield and attack
the ' unit leaders ' is a new *initiative* setup by @entity12 after @entity14 's *shoddy* @entity25 performance in @entity26
