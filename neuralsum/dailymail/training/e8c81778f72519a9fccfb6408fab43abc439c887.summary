' the advice is to avoid all travel to @entity6 - anyone who does travel is putting themselves in considerable danger			2
' travelling abroad for the purpose of engaging in terrorist related activity is an offence and we will seek to prosecute anyone engaged in this type of activity			0
' the issue is not unique to @entity45 or @entity58 and is a priority for police and security services across the @entity9			1

he told @entity118 's @entity117 programme : ' you speak to prison governors , as i do , prison officers , as i do - the inadequacy of the training is quite shocking			2
@entity99 justice secretary @entity98 warned that radicalisation in prisons was a big problem and called on greater efforts to combat it ' but also their inability to tackle this problem is a big issue and we should be doing much , much more			0
' there 's no point in politicians from this government coming on with their heads in their hands , blaming parents or mosques - important roles that they have to play as well			2
' earlier , he told the programme : ' the mosques actually do a good job			0

' the problem is with the internet now , with social media , with @entity150			0
' our ability as parents or as governors of a mosque are less than they were and we 've got to redouble our efforts to stop the source , these preachers of hate , getting into people 's bedrooms			0
' i think we 've got to recognise that if you are a young person born and raised in this country and the first time somebody shows you a role model is a bearded man with a @entity168 in @entity169 , or somebody doing bad things in @entity6 or @entity40 , it 's a problem			1

' mr @entity192 said police and intelligence resources were stretched in terms of numbers and knowing where the returning jihadists are			0
he said : ' with this whole business in @entity6 , although there is no linear projection from foreign fighters to domestic terrorists , it 's inevitable that a number will fall into this category			2
