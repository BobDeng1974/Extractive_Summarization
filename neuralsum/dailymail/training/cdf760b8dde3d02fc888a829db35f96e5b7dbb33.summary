scientists are worried about the world 's declining honey bee population , which could devastate the crops and lead to food shortages across the globe			2
now , in a bid to stop the rapid decline , experts have fitted ‘ backpack ’ sensors to 5,000 bees in @entity12 to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by the ‘ colony collapse disorder ’ that is decimating bee populations in other countries			1
the research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well			1
researchers quickly glued the tiny @entity38 sensors to their backs while they were sleepy			1
after a few minutes , the honeybees woke up and were ready to return to their hive and start gathering valuable information			2
dr @entity44 said : ‘ this is a non-destructive process and the sensors appear to have no impact on the bee 's ability to fly and carry out its normal duties			2
’ scientists at the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) have fitted 5,000 tiny sensors , measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of honey bees in @entity28 , @entity29 , before releasing them into the wild			1
it is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring			0
‘ honey bees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture , which various crops rely on to increase yields ’ said @entity24 science leader dr @entity57 , who is heading up the swarm sensing project			1
‘ a recent @entity24 study showed bee pollination in @entity68 beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent			1
‘ around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination , but honey bee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded @entity77 mite and @entity78			0
‘ thankfully , @entity12 is currently free from both of those threats , ’ he added			0
the bees ' high - tech backpacks ( pictured ) are tiny @entity38 ( @entity38 ) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point			1
the information is then sent to a central location where researchers can build a three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape the research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honey bees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals			1
‘ using this technology , we aim to understand the bee 's relationship with its environment , ’ said dr de @entity44			0
‘ this should help us understand optimal productivity conditions as well as further our knowledge of the cause of colony collapse disorder , ’ in which worker bees from a beehive or @entity115 honey bee colony abruptly disappear			1
the bees ’ high - tech backpacks are tiny @entity38 ( @entity38 ) sensors that record when an insect passes a particular check point			1
the information is then sent remotely to a central location where researchers can use the signals from the 5,000 sensors to build a comprehensive three dimensional model and discover how the insects move through the landscape			1
dr @entity44 said : ‘ bees are social insects that return to the same point and operate on a very predictable schedule			1
there are only enough honeybees in @entity137 to properly pollinate a quarter of the country ’s crops , scientists claim			0
destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees , which are vital for food production			0
professor @entity149 of the @entity150 , who led the research project , said : ‘ we face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity156 , found that @entity115 has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops			2
bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides			0
previous studies have estimated that the number of @entity137 honeybees have halved over the last 25 years			0
scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination			2
the new pesticide , @entity172 / gna , has no effect on bees ' learning , which is key to their foraging for food			0
researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly ' bee safe ' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies			0
a stock image of crop spraying is pictured ' any change in their behaviour indicates a change in their environment			0
if we can model their movements , we 'll be able to recognise very quickly when their activity shows variation and identify the cause			0
' this will help us understand how to maximise their productivity as well as monitor for any biosecurity risks			0
' the scientists involved in the project believe that understanding bee behaviour will give farmers and fruit growers improved management knowledge , which will help them increase the benefit received from nature ’s free pollination service			2
the researchers are working with the @entity215 , the @entity216 , local beekeepers in @entity28 and fruit growers around the state to trial the technology			1
the next stage of the project is to reduce the size of the sensors to only 1mm so they can be attached to smaller insects such as mosquitoes and fruit flies .			2

scientists at the @entity24 are tracking a colony in @entity28 , @entity29
bees wear tiny @entity38 sensors to provide researchers with information needed to discover how the insects move through the landscape
