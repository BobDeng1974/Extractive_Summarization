by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 04:35 est , 5 november 2013 high ambitions : @entity2 , 21 , from @entity3 , will train at taxpayers ' expense taxpayers face a bill of tens of thousands of pounds so a failed asylum seeker can train to be a pilot			2
@entity2 will be given flying lessons costing £ 10,000 even though the government says he must leave the @entity12 next year			1
the 21 - year - old from @entity3 will also get up to £ 10,000 in living expenses			1
a council is being forced to pay up after a court ruled it must meet mr @entity2 ’s education costs after leaving school			1
critics called the decision a ‘ blank cheque ’ which is ‘ deeply unfair ’ on taxpayers and questioned whether learning to fly should be paid from the public purse			1
the council is also funding mr @entity2 ’s younger brother , @entity25 , 20 , to start a degree at @entity27			1
the @entity28 came to the @entity12 with their older brother and father in 2004			2
their asylum application was refused but they were granted discretionary leave to stay in the @entity12 until november 2014			0
shortly after their arrival , they were abandoned by the older family members			0
they were placed in council care in @entity39 and attended a local comprehensive , where they attained gcses and a-levels			2
by law , local authorities have a duty to help meet training costs of those with no parents so that they can enter the workplace			1
usually , these costs are living expenses for apprenticeships and college courses – not the enormous sums associated with a degree or professional qualification			1
victory : @entity2 , who will train for a year to become a pilot , sits at the controls of a plane but the brothers ’ lawyers argued that the council should pick up the bill as their immigration status barred them from applying for a student loan			2
@entity69 - controlled @entity39 city council fought the claim in the @entity71 and the @entity72 , but lost , in a ruling likely to set a precedent for other claims			2
it now faces providing loans of up to £ 20,000 per year to each brother , with the amount to be repaid once they start work			1
the brothers plan to apply for indefinite leave to remain in the @entity12 but there is no guarantee it will be granted			0
they may be able to transfer to a normal student loan arrangement if their application is successful – which could see them repaying some of the cost of their education			0
mr @entity2 is taking the lessons at flight training @entity91 at @entity93 , @entity94 , and hopes to then apply for a degree in aviation			0
the training for a private pilot ’s licence involves a minimum of 45 flying hours and seven theoretical exams as well as a flight test			0
the flying school charges £ 165 per hour - long training session , while a flight test costs £ 185			1
aerial view : mr @entity2 is taking the lessons at flight training @entity91 at @entity93 ( pictured ) in @entity94 , and hopes to then apply for a degree in aviation yesterday @entity109 , a @entity109 councillor , said : ‘ i can see why the council should support them going to a local college and so on but this seems over and above what people would expect			2
the public would be surprised that the council is obliged to pay for flying lessons			0
‘ we have n’t budgeted for this			0
is this a blank cheque to give them whatever they ask for ? ’ if @entity124 seeks to pursue a degree after his flying lessons , the council fears it will have to foot the bill for that too – up to £ 30,000 in fees and a similar amount in living costs			1
@entity133 , of the @entity134 ’ @entity132 , said : ‘ this judgment is absolutely farcical and deeply unfair on the taxpayers footing the bill			1
' we have n’t budgeted for this			0
is this a blank cheque to give them whatever they ask for ? ' - @entity109 , @entity109 councillor ‘ lots of parents scrimp and save to provide their children opportunities for further education , yet now they ’re also paying for this young man ’s flying lessons			1
the brothers were granted leave to remain , not a free ride			0
’ @entity154 @entity153 mep @entity152 added : ‘ i find this totally bizarre			0
the council are in a difficult position if the @entity72 has ordered it but most taxpayers will be appalled that they are funding flying lessons for a refugee , however well intentioned he is			1
’ the brothers both applied for courses beginning last autumn , but when they discovered the funding was not available they deferred their places			0
they then instructed lawyers to pursue a claim with @entity168 to provide the funding			1
@entity170 , of @entity171 , said : ‘ we are thrilled that the @entity72 found in favour of our clients			0
they will now be able to go on to higher education , where they plan to complete their studies , secure a career here in the @entity12 and repay their student loans in full to @entity39 city council			2
’ the case came about after the government changed the rules in 2011 as to who could apply for a student loan			0
the new rules stated those with discretionary leave to remain were no longer eligible for a loan .			0

@entity193 will also get up to £ 10,000 in living expenses
court rules council must meet his education costs after leaving school
critics call decision ' blank cheque ' which is ' deeply unfair ' on taxpayers
