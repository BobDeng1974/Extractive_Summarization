by @entity0 when the @entity3 poet @entity2 was writing @entity4 around 2,800 years ago , the @entity1 went through an abrupt period of cooling , caused by the sun - and the same could happen again soon			1
scientists at the @entity9 analysed lake sediment in @entity11 , and found direct evidence of a sudden cooling caused by a ' solar minimum '			1
some scientists suspect that the current period of high solar activity - including increased sunspots and solar storms thsi year - will be followed by a ' minimum ' period , which could even cause an @entity21			1
scientists at the @entity9 analysed lake sediment in @entity11 , and found direct evidence of a sudden cooling caused by a ' solar minimum ' when the @entity3 poet homer was writing @entity4 around 2,800 years ago , the @entity1 went through an abrupt period of cooling , caused by the sun - and the same could happen again soon if the @entity9 research is correct , a new ' solar minimum ' could have a direct impact on @entity1 's climate - cooling our planet drastically , and knocking the predictions of global - warming alarmists out of whack			1
dr @entity38 of the @entity9 said , ' an abrupt cooling in @entity40 together with an increase in humidity and particularly in windiness coincided with a sustained reduction in solar activity 2800 years ago			1
' @entity38 's measurement 's of lake sediments allow ' a precise dating even of short - term climate changes			0
' the ' @entity50 ' - the solar minimum that coincided with the famous poet 's lifetime - caused a cool period that lasted 200 years			1
' scientists from the @entity55 for @entity9 in collaboration with @entity58 and @entity59 colleagues provide evidence for a direct solar - climate linkage on centennial timescales , ' say the researchers			2
' using the most modern methodological approach , they analysed sediments from @entity11 , a maar lake in the @entity67 / @entity66 , to determine annual variations in climate and solar activity			2
' suggestions that the sun might affect climate so profoundly are controversial			0
@entity75 ’s use of fossil fuels has led to billions of tons of carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere , triggering global temperature rises from which experts believe we will take millennia to recover			0
that is the consensus view			0
three centuries ago similar changes in the @entity87 were linked to a period of almost unprecedented cold , known as the ‘ little ice - age ’ - a time when the ice on @entity95 ’s @entity94 was regularly a foot deep and when thousands went hungry because crops froze in the fields			2
@entity100 on the @entity94 at @entity95 1683 : his best evidence for this link comes from the last time the @entity87 went to sleep , the so - called @entity105 ¿ period from 1645 to 1715 the link between solar ‘ moods ’ and the weather down here on @entity1 was first noticed in the 1970s , when the @entity111 astronomer @entity110 noticed a strong correlation between historic weather records and contemporaneous accounts of solar activity , most notably the long record of sunspots published a century before by the astronomer @entity118			2
@entity110 noticed that a ‘ quiet ’ @entity87 correlates with cold weather and a manic phase means warmer conditions			0
his best evidence for this link comes from the last time the @entity87 went to sleep , the so - called ‘ @entity124 ’ period from 1645 to 1715			0
during this period and for about a century either side , much of @entity40 and @entity125 suffered a succession of bitterly cold winters and damp washout summers - the ‘ little ice age ’ .			0

@entity11 sediment proves ' solar minimum ' caused 200 years of cooling 2,800 years ago
new minimum *due* soon - after this year 's increased sunspot activity
@entity87 's activity can cause changes in @entity1 's climate , claim scientists
may throw predictions of global warming out of whack
