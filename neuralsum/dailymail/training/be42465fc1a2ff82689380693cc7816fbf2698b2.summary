by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 19:01 est , 6 september 2012 @entity1 behaving badly : @entity0 gets set to fool the nation when i turned up on set for my new @entity6 hidden camera series @entity7 , i thought someone was playing a joke on me			1
there were 25 crew waiting to get started , compared to the five of us who made @entity15 back in 2000			1
how can you secretly film people with 25 crew hanging about , i thought ? it soon became apparent , however , that these people were going to make my life a whole lot easier so i could concentrate on what i was good at : approaching strangers as different characters and causing mayhem			1
the cameramen used all sorts of methods to conceal themselves			1
we even had a ‘ pram - cam ’ , with a camera inside instead of a baby			1
at first it looked a bit weird with a beefy bloke pretending to play with his baby for hours on end , so we provided him with a female member of the production team to look like his wife and it all appeared a bit less suspicious			1
we also used workmen ’s tents			1
we ’d set these up in the middle of a square , and it was incredible how no one paid them a blind bit of notice			2
the idea was to film stuff all over @entity54 ... and we did just that			2
it was mostly a very easy and happy shoot , but when you ’re dealing with the general public you never quite know what ’s going to happen			2
we were filming in the @entity60 at @entity61 with me as a vicar who ca n’t help behaving badly , and i had just pretended to spray a cyclist ( the vicar loathes cyclists ) with @entity67			1
the cyclist then crashes into the river			2
normally passers - by just watch whatever scene is being acted out and do that very @entity54 thing of not wanting to get involved			2
this time , however , an angry man announced he was going to headbutt me			2
hidden fear : @entity0 had to stop filming his new series in @entity76 after he was threatened by a man claiming to be a member of the local mafia but i stood my ground , as i presumed most people who headbutt people do n’t announce the fact in advance			1
this was very nearly a big mistake , as at least four times he pulled his head back as if to strike			0
he calmed down when he learned it was for tv and found it very funny			0
until he remembered that the lady he was with was not his wife and quickly refused all consent for us to show it			0
this turned out to be a common theme while we were filming			1
you ’d be amazed at the number of people who are n’t with the person they ’re supposed to be with			0
we also spent a week targeting @entity54 tourists in @entity106 , which is where i nearly came to sticky end			0
i was playing a @entity76 lothario , with tight leather pants and flowing locks , and was about to approach some @entity114 ‘ ladeeez ’ on the beach			0
@entity116 , a huge @entity115 appeared and squared up to me			0
it turned out he was convinced i ’d been driving a car that had knocked him off his motorbike			0
to make things worse , i was told in terrified , hushed whispers that he was ‘ local mafia ’			0
an executive decision was taken and i was bundled into a van and driven back to the hotel , where i spent the rest of the day in the pool as it was considered too dangerous to film			0
nice work if you can get it ! @entity7 , @entity133 , 6.55pm .			0
