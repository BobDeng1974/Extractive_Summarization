' mr @entity7 said he felt compelled to tell his story after mr @entity3 said that thousands of people with @entity1 in the @entity69 were not @entity69			1

it ’s not a good place for any of them to be , i know , but 60 per cent of them are not @entity69 nationals			0

he told @entity39 : ' i thought , " what 's another way of doing it ? " even though i knew people were surviving from @entity1 , i thought , " perhaps if i can make myself so ill , get the worst strain possible , that would be one way of getting rid of myself			2
'' ' but the prospective mp said he realised once he was diagnosed he did not want @entity1 at all , and that all his actions were just an attempt to ' annihilate ' himself			0
