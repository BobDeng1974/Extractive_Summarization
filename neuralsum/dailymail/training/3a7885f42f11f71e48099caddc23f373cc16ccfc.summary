excessive ? a new report claims that @entity1 was shot more than a hundred times by @entity3 in the 2011 raid special operations sources have claimed that the terror leader was shot more than one hundred times in the fatal 2011 raid			1
a new report from a website known within the intelligence and armed services community claims that the sheer number of times that @entity1 was shot is the reason why the government has never released photos of his dead body			1
citing two confidential sources , the @entity20 tells how ' operator after operator took turns dumping magazines - worth of ammunition into @entity1 â€™s body '			1
the site goes on to argue that while the @entity3 may have felt it was ' morally , legally , and ethically appropriate to shoot the body a few times to ensure that he is really dead and no longer a threat , ' that does not justify the extent of this damage			1
' what happened on the @entity1 raid is beyond excessive			2
the level of excess shown was not about making sure that @entity1 was no longer a threat			0
the excess was pure self - indulgence , ' author @entity41 writes			0
at the time of the assassination , president @entity44 and his administration argued that they were justified in never releasing the photos of the dead body or the burial at sea because they could be used as propaganda for @entity55			1
the new theories , however , suggest that they are just trying to avoid retribution for allegedly being excessive			2
in his book , @entity85 does not put a firm number on the amount of bullets used but it sounds far less excessive than the latest reports			2
' in his death throes , he was still twitching and convulsing			0
another assaulter and i trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds , ' @entity85 wrote in @entity103 which was published in september 2012			0
' the bullets tore into him , slamming his body into the floor until he was motionless			0
' incorrect depiction : the latest information suggests the raid of the @entity1 compound went down very differently to the events since fictionalized in @entity60 in films like @entity61 , pictured his version : @entity85 , who was a member of @entity115 who was at the raid described them using far fewer bullets to kill the elderly terror leader tension : the raid of @entity1 's @entity67 compound was watched by president @entity44 and his closest advisers in the @entity123 of the @entity124 @entity41 argues that the number of bullets used is less of a issue pertaining specifically to this particular case but grows problematic if it represents a changing attitude within the @entity3			1
' gone unchecked , these actions get worse over time , ' the @entity131 special operations veteran writes			0
' the real issue is not that @entity1 was turned into @entity135 cheese , but rather that this type of behavior has become a @entity138 in this unit			0

special ops sources have claimed that the navy seal team *unloaded* *multiple* magazines full of ammunition into the dead terror leader 's corpse
some think the alleged excessive *treatment* is the reason why the @entity44 administration has not released the ' death photos ' of the @entity55 leader
@entity124 has always said that any photos of his dead body or sea burial would be used as propaganda by terror cells
