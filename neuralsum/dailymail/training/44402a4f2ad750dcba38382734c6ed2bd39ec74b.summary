by @entity1 reporter published : 23:27 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 23:34 est , 22 august 2013 when you have an audience with the @entity5 , it 's worth making an impression - a concept that this little boy appears to have fully grasped			0
the toddler , who has not been identified , dropped to the floor of a cafe , for some attention - grabbing kicking and flailing while president @entity14 held an informal meeting on thursday			1
@entity14 , who was meeting with college students and graduates alongside education secretary @entity18 , appeared not to have noticed the antics at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
look at me ! @entity14 , with education secretary @entity18 , talks with college students at @entity25 , as a child plays on the floor , in @entity21 , @entity22 on thursday a woman sitting with a stroller at a table opposite the high - powered group appears to be the boy 's mother as she laughs at his antics			1
official @entity36 photographer @entity35 posted the picture on @entity38 on thursday with the words : ' a young boy plays as @entity14 lunches with college students and their parents in @entity21 , @entity22			1
' the president had lunch at the café and deli during his college affordability bus tour on thursday			2
as his motorcade made its way from @entity51 to @entity52 , the president stopped off in @entity21 to have lunch at a restaurant with a small group of college students , recent graduates and their parents			1
he then made another pitch for his college affordability proposals to a crowd of high school students , parents and educators at @entity52 ’s @entity64			1
focused : @entity14 appeared not to see the toddler rolling around on the floor just in front of him as he ate lunch with college students and recent graduates in @entity21 @entity14 is touting a new program that will rate colleges by the expected income of their graduates , compared against the cost of tuition			1
@entity14 says the plan will help parents and students make better - informed decisions about higher education			1
but the proposed overhaul faced immediate skepticism from college leaders who worry the rankings could cost their institutions millions of dollars , as well as from congressional @entity87 wary of deepening the government ’s role in higher education			2
the president , speaking to a student - heavy crowd of 7,000 at the @entity51 , said he expected pushback from those who have profited from the ballooning cost of college			2
but he argued that with the nation ’s economy still shaky and students facing increasing global competition , making college affordable is ' an economic imperative '			1
' higher education can not be a luxury , ' @entity14 said during the first stop on the tour through @entity22 and @entity108			1
' every @entity110 family should be able to get it			0
' bus tour : @entity14 delivers remarks at the @entity51 in @entity22 as he travels around to promote his plan to cut college costs republicans on @entity117 weighed in quickly with criticism			1
@entity119 of @entity120 , the top @entity87 on the @entity121 , cast the proposal as government overreach and suggested a state - by - state approach would be preferable			0
' @entity125 needs to be careful about taking a good idea for one state and forcing all 6,000 institutions of higher education to do the exact same thing , turning @entity125 into a sort of national school board for our colleges and universities , ' @entity119 said			0
for colleges and universities , millions of federal aid dollars could be on the line if schools are downgraded under the government rating system			0
however , if colleges line up against the idea of tying ratings to federal aid , the proposal would face nearly impossible odds			0
almost all members of @entity148 have colleges or universities in their districts , and a coordinated effort to rally students and educators against the plan would probably kill it quickly			2
' this is extraordinarily complicated stuff , and it ’s not clear we have the complete data or accurate data , ' said @entity161 , the president of the @entity162 that represents colleges and universities in @entity125			0
from @entity51 , @entity14 climbed aboard his armored black bus for a road trip that was to take him through western and central @entity22 as well as northeastern @entity108 over two days			1
' @entity166 ' : @entity14 's bus drives through the streets of @entity52 after the president spoke about affordable college education at @entity64 on thursday the education - focused trip underscores the degree to which the @entity36 is seeking to keep the president ’s public agenda focused on domestic issues , even as international crises flair in @entity178 and @entity179			1
' as we ’re weighing these domestic policy positions and foreign policy decisions , the president puts the interests of the @entity110 first , ' @entity36 spokesman @entity180 said			0
' the fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the president has his priorities straight			0
' the education proposals are part of the broader economic agenda @entity14 has been pitching across the country this summer			1
the tour is aimed at building public support for his economic policies ahead of fiscal fights with @entity148 this fall			0
the rising cost of college has increasingly become a burden for many @entity110			2
according to administration figures , the tuition costs at public , four - year universities has tripled over the last 30 years and average student loan debt stands at $ 26,000			0
over the past five years , the tuition sticker price at public four - year colleges is up 27 per cent beyond overall inflation , according to a @entity211 survey			0
at private schools , the average student ’s cost has risen 13 percent beyond overall inflation			0
meet and greet : president @entity14 shakes hands with @entity216 , 66 , in @entity21 , as he talks to patrons outside @entity218 's on @entity219 there has been little consensus among policymakers on how to curb college costs			1
while @entity14 ’s proposal could give colleges an incentive to slow increases , it could also add massive reporting requirements that could be a burden on schools already struggling to make ends meet			1
the new rating system does not require congressional approval , and the @entity36 is aiming to have it set up before the 2015 school year			0
but @entity14 does need support from @entity148 in order to use the ratings as a basis for parceling out federal financial aid			1
in addition to tuition , schools will also be rated on average student loan debt , graduation rates and the average earnings of graduates			2
under @entity14 ’s proposal , students attending highly rated schools could receive larger grants and more affordable loans			1
the president is also seeking legislation to give colleges a ' bonus ' based on the number of students they graduate who received @entity258			2
the goal is to encourage colleges to enroll and graduate low - and moderate - income students			2
@entity14 ’s other proposals include a requirement that colleges with high dropout rates distribute student aid over the course of the semester rather than in a lump sum			1
the aim is to ensure that students who drop out do not receive funds for time they are not in school			0
the president also renewed his call for a $ 1 billion college ' @entity278 ' competition that would reward states that make significant changes in higher education policies while also containing tuition costs			0
for @entity14 , who has made no secret of his desire to get out of @entity125 when he can , the bus tours have become a favorite method for reconnecting with the public			2
beyond his official events , the president often makes unscheduled stops at local restaurants and businesses , and sometimes pulls off on the side of the road to greet cheering crowds			0
on friday , @entity14 plans to hold a town hall meeting at @entity297 , then travel to @entity298 , @entity108 , for an event at @entity300			1
vice president @entity301 , a @entity298 native , is to join @entity14 in his hometown			2
@entity301 has spent much of the week in @entity303 , where his son @entity304 underwent a medical procedure at a cancer center			0
the president ’s highly secure bus was purchased by the @entity309 in 2011 for $ 1.1 million			0
the bus - unofficially known as ' @entity166 ' - has dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights .			0
