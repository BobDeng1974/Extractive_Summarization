fitting an airport into an area that measures just 2.3 square miles was never going to be easy task			1
thankfully , @entity4 had a novel way of solving the issue			2
the airport which serves the @entity9 overseas territory has made full use of the minimal space and lack of flat land available by building its only runway through the heart of the peninsula ’s busiest road			1
for about 10 minutes , traffic stays at a standstill to allow a flights to depart and arrive from @entity9 cities including @entity41 , @entity42 , or @entity43			1
a pair of barriers close ahead of every landing and departure , which currently number around 30 a week , all flying to and from the @entity9			0
the airport is just 500 yards from the centre of @entity4 - the shortest commute of any major airport in the world			1
as well as serving cars and other vehicles , the road also carries pedestrians in and out of @entity4			1
there are currently three flights operated daily to @entity59 and @entity60 , and three flights a week to @entity43 it was in 2007 the government released plans for a new four - lane road that would divert traffic through a tunnel under the runway as a result , the @entity20 programme @entity21 once ranked the airport the fifth most extreme airport in the world			1

however , the runway was later extended into the @entity106 using rock blasted from the historic @entity108 which was being excavated by the military who were creating a series of tunnels inside			0
the four - lane main road was then added which leads from the centre of @entity4 , through the airport , and up to the @entity79 border which lies just north of the runway			1
at one stage , the road across the runway was considered to be constraining operations at the airport because of the increase in traffic following the signing of the @entity126 in 2006			2
