by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 12:45 est , 25 july 2013 tragedy : six - year - old @entity2 died from pneumonia after a doctor mistook him for another child with a ' do not resuscitate order ' a boy of six died after a hospital doctor mixed him up with another child who was subject to a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order , an inquest heard			1
dr @entity12 admitted she stopped staff who were trying to save @entity2 ’s life and said she had not bothered to check his identity			1
the paediatric registrar said : ‘ i should have checked the face before stopping			1
‘ but i had been working for 12 hours with no break			2
’ @entity2 , who had @entity20 ’s syndrome , was admitted to the @entity21 with breathing difficulties , a raised temperature and high heart rate			1
his condition deteriorated and he suffered a cardiac arrest			0
dr @entity27 , 36 , admitted she was ‘ not on top of things ’ having recently returned from 13 months of maternity leave			1
she said that during her time off work , she had become ‘ deskilled in the management and treatment of shock ’ , failed to recognise @entity2 was in shock and failed to recognise his ‘ grossly abnormal ’ blood results			2
a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order on a patient ’s file means that a doctor is not required to revive a patient if their heart stops			0
they are issued after discussions with parents or their family			0
they are designed to prevent unnecessary suffering , for example if a patient ’s condition is such that resuscitation is unlikely to succeed or if successful resuscitation would lead to a poor quality of life			0
but @entity2 ’s mother @entity58 , 39 , described him as a ‘ tough little cookie ’ and confirmed a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order had never been placed on him			2
heartbroken : @entity2 's parents @entity61 and @entity63 both attended the inquest into their son 's death yesterday dr @entity27 confused @entity2 with another youngster on the same ward who was subject to a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order , the inquest at @entity68 heard			1
@entity2 died of pneumonia in the hospital on february 18 , 2011 , the same day he was admitted , after @entity75 interrupted attempts to resuscitate him			1
asked by @entity79 coroner @entity78 whether she actually saw @entity2 ’s face before telling staff to stop , dr @entity27 said : ‘ there were a lot of people in the room and i ca n’t remember if i saw a face or not			1
‘ but what was important to me was not to resuscitate a child that was not to be resuscitated			2
’ she realised her mistake only when another doctor asked her : ‘ why is @entity2 not for resuscitation ? ’ dr @entity27 then shouted : ‘ he is for resus – it ’s the wrong patient , ’ the inquest heard			1
as soon as she realised her mistake , she returned to @entity2 and tried to treat him as part of a team of medics who battled for nearly an hour to resuscitate him , but were unsuccessful			2
paediatric registrar dr @entity12 said she was ' not on top of things ' after working a 12 hour shift without a break at @entity21 , pictured she was also questioned about why she had telephoned @entity2 ’s mother two days after his death			1
dr @entity27 told the inquest it was ‘ just out of courtesy ’ and claimed she only later found out from the hospital trust that she was not meant to			1
yesterday mrs @entity58 and her husband @entity63 , 47 , of @entity110 , @entity79 , who also have a younger daughter , listened as the inquest was told how the ‘ crash team ’ was called when @entity2 went into cardiac arrest at about 7.45pm			2
his mother had been at his bedside and it was she who first asked for help			0
staff nurse @entity120 wept as she told how doctors ‘ came running ’ and began trying to resuscitate @entity2 , but then dr @entity27 told them to stop			1
she said : ‘ it was very overwhelming			0
i tried to save him and i could n’t			0
’ the inquest , expected to last another four days , continues			0
do not resuscitate orders would normally be issued when resuscitation will not restart the heart or breathing , will be of no benefit to the patient , or when the burdens are outweighed by the benefits			0
guidelines issued by the @entity134 and the @entity135 require discussion with patients or their family before the orders can be made			0
they can be made if resuscitation is unlikely to succeed ; if a mentally competent patient has consistently asked not to be resuscitated , or has said so in their will ; or if resuscitation would lead to poor quality of life			0
the process of keeping patients breathing can be violent and cause trauma to patients , such as broken ribs , other fractures , a ruptured spleen or brain damage .			0
