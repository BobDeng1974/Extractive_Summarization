by @entity0 published : 08:35 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 11:16 est , 11 october 2012 the parents of twins dying from a rare genetic disorder which will kill them before they 're 12 are planning the family ’s final holiday together			1
seven - year - old brothers @entity6 and @entity8 were born apparently perfectly healthy but were diagnosed with deadly @entity10 ’s disease when they were three			1
they are the only identical twins in the world with the neurological condition which affects just one in every 300,000 births			1
doctors told devastated parents @entity17 and @entity19 their sons would probably die before they were teenagers			1
@entity6 and @entity8 ( pictured with parents @entity19 and @entity17 ) are the only twins in the @entity23 suffering from @entity10 disease , a rare degenerative condition which means they will die before their 12th birthday the boys were born apparently perfectly healthy but the one - in - a - million illness has left them blind and autistic the boys are now almost completely blind and suffer from autism			1
in the coming years they are also likely to become wheelchair bound			0
blood tests revealed their parents - who were initially told they could not have children - both carry the @entity10 gene which they passed onto their sons			1
now the couple , from @entity38 , are planning a final dream holiday for the family before their sons - who turned seven on last month - become too ill to travel			1
mr @entity8 , 34 , who quit his job as a furniture maker to care for his sons , said : ' it is heartbreaking watching the boys deteriorate and knowing that there is nothing that can be done			1
' we are just making the most of each day that they are still here			0
' the boys both love swimming , so we take them to the pool four times a week			0
but what they really love is the sun. even though they are blind they can tell it 's is bright when it ’s sunny so they are much happier in summer			2
we went on holiday to @entity63 thanks to the charity starlight			2
we now want to take them on holiday to @entity67 where they can swim with dolphins			1
the twins aged three months with mother @entity17 ( left ) and today ( right )			2
their birth was remarkable as the couple had been told they would be unable to have children ' when @entity17 and i got together we swam with dolphins in the @entity77 and we always said if we had children we ’d do it with them			1
it ’s our final wish to do that one thing for our boys			2
' that would be a real dream for us to do that but obviously that costs a lot but we are saving up			0
' the couple , who have been together for 10 years , were delighted when @entity17 fell pregnant in 2004			0
doctors had told mr @entity8 he was unlikely to be able to father children after undergoing gruelling chemotherapy after being struck down with leukaemia aged 19			1
ms @entity17 was also warned the chances of her being able to conceive were low after suffering from endometriosis			0
but against incredible odds , her pregnancy was healthy and @entity6 was born weighing 3lbs 11oz while @entity8 was born minutes later weighing 4lbs 20z			1
they sat up at the age of 11 months , took their first steps at 21 months , and even started to say their first words			0
but before the age of three , their mother noticed their eyes started to flicker and they tripped over things			0
the boys ' parents , pictured in the @entity77 several years ago , are planning a final family holiday to @entity67 to swim with dolphins the boys were referred to a paediatrician at the @entity112 in @entity38 where tests discovered they were both blind , despite having been born with perfect eyesight			1
in august 2010 they were diagnosed with @entity115 ( @entity115 ) and their parents were told the boys had less than 10 years to live			1
the disease is an inherited disorder of the nervous system which emerges in early childhood			2
the cruel disease leaves youngsters blind , bedridden , and mentally impaired - with the life expectancy for children with the disease between 8 - 12 years			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity128 said the charity was not aware of any other twins in the @entity23 with the condition			2
ms @entity17 , a nurse , said : ' at first i thought that it was because the sun was in their eyes , or it was just that they were being clumsy			0
' but when their eyes started to flicker , i knew something was wrong			0
now blind and autistic , the twins can not understand why they can no longer see , read or stand for themselves ' they would try and pick up objects from the floor and completely miss them			1
it was as if they were struggling to see			0
' we were so shocked when we were told that they had lost their sight , as when they were born there had been nothing wrong with their vision			2
' i ’d heard of @entity115 , and i knew it was something terrible			0
when the doctors told us that they both had it , it was devastating			2
' we 'd never imagined it could be anything as serious as that			0
we were so shocked , we could n’t speak			0
' she said the twins ' frustration at the situation makes the situation even more heartbreaking			2
' it is very difficult and frustrating for them as they do n’t understand why they ca n’t see any more , or read their favourite books			0
' it ’s also hard because it ’s like having toddlers who can reach anything , so we have to be with them constantly			0
' all our efforts are focused on making the most of the time we 've got left			0

@entity6 and @entity8 the only identical twins in the world with deadly neurological condition @entity10 disease
born seemingly healthy but now blind and autistic and will need wheelchairs
diagnosis even more devastating for their parents who were told they would never have children
