from tiny keyboards that learn your intentions to ones that fold in half to save space , the race is on to modify the humble computer keyboard , which has remained largely unchanged since it was invented			2
now @entity8 has been granted a patent that hints that the clunky piece of hardware could one day be replaced with not much at all			1
it suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet , any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard			1
just like magic : @entity8 has been granted a patent ( image shown ) that suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet , any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard the design would make it far easier to type on devices with smaller touchscreens , which are currently dominated by pop - up keyboards			1
the patent suggests that a user would tap on a surface just as if they were typing on a regular keyboard			1
the audio sensors would decipher vibrations made by tapping to work out which ‘ keys ’ a user is pressing and the corresponding letters would appear on a screen , like normal , @entity35 reported			1
the patent hints that the @entity8 is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise large piece of hardware , which have outgrown portable devices such as tablets and phones			1
a @entity50 patent ( pictured ) shows a system that could turn a user ’s hand into a keyboard developers have created a keyboard cover that turns every key of the board into one emoji			1
once installed , the @entity61 key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to @entity67 posts , tweets and even official documents			0
developers have made a keyboard cover that turns every key into one emoji ( shown ) the @entity73 and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at @entity79 - based @entity78			2
each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust , dirt and liquid			0
more than 150 emoji are accessible directly from the keyboard but using the @entity90 , and option keys gives access to related characters			0
it is available to pre-order from @entity94 for just $ 15 ( £ 10 ) and , if funded , will ship in april			0
the design may have a few drawbacks however , as it could make typing tricky for people who ca n’t touch type and no cushioning when pressing ‘ keys ’ would mean that the process could become uncomfortable or even painful after a while			0
while the patent filing does n’t mean that @entity8 is working on the design , it hints that the firm is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise the traditionally large piece of hardware , which has outgrown many portable devices such as tablets and phones			1
a patent filed by @entity50 last march showed a wearable system that could turn a user ’s hand into a keyboard			1
in the proposed system , people wearing a camera - on a @entity121 - style device dubbed @entity122 - would be able to look down at their hands , which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard , and use their thumbs to select the keys , negating the need for a physical keyboard			2
the patent reads : ‘ recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses - type terminal and wristwatch terminals			0
‘ such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen			0
' the system involves a camera for capturing an image , a storage unit that stores the ‘ key to hand mapping table , ’ a display and a control unit			2
numbers could be assigned to a forefinger , for example , while symbols could be assigned to the middle finger			0
alternatively , letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to bottom			0
users would then use their thumb to ‘ press ’ the various keys on both hands			0
the camera would capture the movement of the thumb , or identify the force pressed onto each finger , to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly .			2

patent suggests audio sensors could be plugged into a phone or tablet
sensors could *detect* vibrations to work out which ' key ' is being pressed
system would transform any flat surface into a full size keyboard
