with her soft dark hair and huge doe eyes , her lips gently pursed and her daughter seated on her lap , @entity0 looked every inch the respectable @entity8 wife			1
but with war just around the corner , life for @entity0 , a mother - of - two who lived in @entity10 , was about to be turned upside down			2
after her husband was sent to fight on the @entity14 , @entity0 took a job in a cafe and it was there she would meet and fall in love with a docker named @entity20			1
tragically , it was a meeting that would have fatal consequences			0
’ @entity0 wrote in her diary at the time			2
less than a year later , @entity0 ’s life was in freefall , ending with her suicide in 1918			1
now the story of @entity0 and her doomed love affair have been turned into a novel - although this is one tale where the truth is even more shocking than fiction			2
' there was great pressure to conform to the strict moral codes of the " respectable " working classes , ' explains author @entity45 , who first came across @entity0 's story while working as a journalist at the @entity47			2
' when war came , women were expected to do their duty , to roll up their sleeves and support the war effort wholeheartedly			0
' in 1915 , when @entity0 was 23 , her husband @entity26 was called up , joining the @entity54 and @entity55 in the december of that year			1
horrors : wounded soldiers from one of the @entity10 regiments struggle away from the frontline in 1916 story : @entity45 , a former @entity47 journalist , has turned @entity0 's story into a novel , before the fall with @entity26 shipped off to @entity63 shortly afterwards , @entity0 was left to bring up two children on the meagre separation allowance of 3s 6d a week , topped up to 7s by the government			1
it was n't enough and so , @entity0 took a job in a cafe			2
there , she regularly encountered a handsome young docker named @entity20 and the two swiftly embarked on an affair			1
' i can imagine she might have been reluctant to work in the munitions factories , ' adds @entity45			0
' although the work was well - paid , handling the chemicals could have a serious effect on workers ’ health			0
' the café must have seemed a much safer option and another perk was that @entity0 was allowed a meal with each shift			2
food became scarce as the war dragged on , so this would have been a bonus			0
' despite the affair , @entity0 , who was described by her employer as ‘ respectable , sober and hard - working ’ , continued to write regularly to her husband as he fought in @entity63 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
but in late summer 1917 , @entity0 's carefully constructed world came crashing down when she discovered that she was pregnant			1
' it would have been clear that the father was not @entity0 ’s husband – he had been away for 16 months without leave , ' says @entity45			1
' @entity0 was shunned by her family and forced to leave her job			1
she moved out of the @entity10 terrace she ’d been sharing with her sister without leaving a forwarding address			0
' in fact , @entity0 had n't moved very far at all , taking her two children and moving in with @entity20 in a fourth - floor flat in @entity107			1
but even then she was n't able to escape the opprobrium heaped on her for falling in love with a man not her husband			0
tough times : @entity10 was subjected to regular zeppelin bombing attacks during the @entity113 @entity114 : many amenities , among them @entity10 buses which were used to ferry troops , were unavailable ' there ’s another " d " word which would have haunted @entity0 – the notion of disgrace , ' adds @entity45			0
' it ’s not a word we hear so often now , but for much of the 20th century it was a standard insult to women who had fallen foul of the strict moral codes which governed working class families			0
' @entity0 would have been branded a disgrace to herself , to her family , and to her country			2
' worse was to come			0
in july 1918 , six weeks after baby @entity132 was born , @entity0 received a letter from her husband that announced he was being allowed home from the front on leave			1
convinced that his return would mean being separated from her children and a life in the workhouse , @entity0 could see only one way out			2
on the morning of july 18th , police arrived at the flat in @entity107 to find @entity0 and her baby lying dead in bed			1
both had died from poison			0
' well , there are plenty like me , ' wrote @entity0 in what would prove to be her last diary entry			0
' i shall not be missed for long			0
' luck , then 32 , attempted to follow by throwing himself under a train at @entity157 station but was unsuccessful and instead found himself under arrest for the murder of @entity0 and her child			1
double tragedy : @entity0 's husband @entity26 , already reeling from the horror of the trenches , never recovered story : the tragic tale of @entity25 and @entity20 has been turned into a novel two months later , he was convicted of their murder and spent the rest of the war in prison before being recommended for release in 1921			1
' the law stated that if there was a suicide pact and one person survived , the survivor was automatically charged with murder , ' explains @entity45			0
' @entity20 was sentenced to hang but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after a petition was sent to the @entity185			0
' in 1921 , @entity20 was recommended for release , but there the trail goes cold			2
the most likely explanation is that @entity20 changed his name when he was released			2
' @entity0 's two children , a son and a daughter , were left to be brought up by relatives while her husband @entity26 was devastated by his wife 's death			1
@entity25 , a decent , straightforward man , was both bewildered by his wife 's actions and left distraught by her death which he was told of in a blunt telegram that read : ' wife and baby dead			1
' according to his granddaughter @entity207 , @entity26 ' never recovered from what happened '			1
' he tried to drown his misery with drink , ' adds @entity45			0
' he died in hospital in the 1940s			0
' @entity0 herself was largely forgotten , sensationalised in media reports at the time but left in the shadows by her own family who wanted nothing more than to forget what had happened			1
' i do n’t think @entity0 was a bad or immoral person so i truly think she reasoned it out and decided that suicide was the most honourable escape , ' says @entity45			2
' poverty plays a huge part			0
there was simply no money , and once her husband discovered the affair – he was finally due home on leave in july 1918 - the separation allowance would have been stopped			1
' the next option would have been a home for " fallen women " or the workhouse			0
she would have been separated from her baby and her older children and she would never have been able to live down the shame			0
' @entity45 's novel , @entity240 , £ 16.99 , is published by @entity242			0
