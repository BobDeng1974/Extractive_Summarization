the romantics will pick @entity2 or @entity3 , the statistics lovers will go for @entity4 or , at a push , @entity6			1
but for me there is one standout contender for manager of the year and that 's @entity12			1
think about what he walked into and what he was expected to achieve in a short space of time			0
you can only be impressed			0
the stricken patient was fading fast , but the @entity23 doctor has n't just stuck plasters over the wounds , he 's breathed life into a giant and resurrected it back to rude health			2
@entity28 boss @entity12 is among those in the running for manager of the year @entity28 's players celebrate together during the derby win against rivals @entity34 @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 celebrate during the 4 - 2 win against @entity34 @entity39 is punching above his weight at @entity34 ... the club must think big or forever remain small forget @entity42 and @entity43 ... the best player in the @entity45 this weekend was @entity47 's @entity46 how stupid do some @entity50 football ' experts ' look now ? after the early - season defeats at @entity52 and @entity47 , they were laying into @entity53			1
they should have known better			0
when a manager as great as @entity53 turns up in the @entity45 , we should all be grateful to witness his genius at close quarters			2
so while he was busy trying to rectify the massive problems he inherited at @entity28 , there were too many who could n't wait to hammer him for every single slip - up			1
and now they 've all gone quiet as @entity28 cement their place in the top four			2
job done – so far , at least			0
the critics will probably say he has n't won anything			0
listen , @entity28 were seventh last season , their defence was decimated in the summer , and this season the two big signings – @entity77 and @entity78 – have , for different reasons , failed to hit the heights they achieved previously			1
@entity81 celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by @entity85 snapper @entity83 despite all of that , @entity53 has taken @entity28 back to where they wanted to be – into the top four			2
in fact , it 's mid-april and @entity28 are still in the title race ( unlikely , but they 're just a point behind @entity92 so of course they 're still in it )			1
sunday 's derby victory was utterly convincing			0
and it highlighted one of the biggest strengths of @entity53 's reign at @entity28 so far – the way he has worked with and improved individual players			1
all of a sudden @entity36 looks brilliant – it was n't just sunday , he 's been arguably @entity28 's best player this season			1
how many managers could have made @entity36 look convincing in a @entity28 shirt ? at the start of the season i was asking the question about @entity111 and @entity112 – could they make the centre - half spots their own ? i think that question is still pertinent , but those two played very well against @entity34 and are starting to look the part in the @entity116 back four			1
players once moaned about , such as @entity81 and @entity36 , are now pivotal parts of the team under @entity53 @entity53 ’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like @entity36 and @entity81 have benefited @entity43 looks indispensible again , when even i was doubting if he would recover from the @entity125 debacle			0
and who knew @entity81 could be so influential for @entity28 ? even @entity53 's decision to give @entity35 the captaincy looks inspired			2
he 's had a brilliant season and he 's led the @entity28 resurgence on the field superbly			2
impressive stuff , so all the critics need to calm down and pay a bit more respect to @entity53 , he deserved a better reception from the @entity50 football public based on his career record alone			0
a little more than a year ago @entity28 were humiliated at home by @entity34			1
@entity53 has single - handedly raised the sinking ship back to the surface , steadied it , and got it sailing full steam ahead			0
he just needs to add a bit of polish next season			0
@entity78 ( third right ) and @entity77 ( right ) were left out of the starting xi by @entity53 on sunday @entity53 shakes hands with his opposite number @entity39 after the final whistle at @entity116			0

@entity28 4 - 2 @entity34 : click here for the match report
@entity12 is in with a shout of winning manager of the year
@entity158 's @entity4 and @entity159 's @entity3 are too
@entity2 could be in if he saves @entity161 from *relegation*
@entity164 : @entity34 must think big or forever remain small
