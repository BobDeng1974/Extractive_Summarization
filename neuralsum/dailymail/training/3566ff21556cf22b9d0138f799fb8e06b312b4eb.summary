by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the stress of the weekly shop can be the cause of a headache for most people			1
but for @entity11 the contents of his shopping basket - and its cost - has become more than a question of simply what he buys and strikes at the heart of his ability to put himself on the side of cash - strapped families			1
first he flounded when put on the spot about how much he spends on a weekly shop			1
now his claim to have a frugal grocery bill of as little as £ 70 has suffered a fresh blow , after it emerged he regularly spends £ 2.25 on an artisan loaf of bread and has his ‘ assertive ’ hair styled by a celebrity crimper			1
he will declare : ‘ @entity50 to make your family better off			2
’ the tour started early this morning with a stop at @entity34 , where he enjoyed a modest bacon sandwich and bought a large bunch of red roses			2
but his attempt to appear to understand the difficulties cash - strapped voters face has been undermined by revelations about the contents of his shopping basket			1
@entity64 claim to often see him popping into the @entity65 in @entity66			1
he regularly buys himself a £ 2 cappuccino , a £ 2.25 loaf of bread and occasional treats himself to a £ 1 croissant , according to @entity72			1
mr @entity11 , who lives nearby with wife @entity73 and sons @entity75 and @entity76 , is also a regular customer at @entity77 where he runs up a bill of around £ 15 on organic milk , fruit and vegetables			1
little wonder , then , that he seemed unsure what to say when grilled on the breakfast tv sofa about his own spending habits			2
appearing on @entity91 ’s @entity90 , mr @entity11 claimed the ‘ cost - of - living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and i am determined we tackle it ’			2
asked about the average weekly household grocery bill , mr @entity11 responded : ‘ it depends on how much you are spending			1
’ pressed on his own family 's bill , mr @entity11 said : ‘ we probably spend £ 70 , £ 80 a week on groceries at least , probably more than that			1
‘ the point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what i am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people			2
’ but tv presenter @entity107 took him to task for appearing out of touch			2
she told him : ‘ the average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £ 100			1
so you are going to be spending significantly more than £ 70 or £ 80			2
‘ people will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality			2
’ official figures for 2012 show that a family of four spent on average £ 113.12 every week , rising to £ 165.48 when eating out was included			2
mr @entity11 is said to be a regular at @entity65 in smart @entity66 in @entity124 mr @entity11 often pops to @entity125 , near to where he lives in @entity124 with wife @entity73 and sons @entity76 ( right ) and @entity75 ( left ) , to buy a loaf of bread costing £ 2.25 hairdresser @entity37 , who has styled @entity130 , has revealed how she tried to give @entity11 a more ' assertive ' haircut all politicians want like a sprinkling of celebrity stardust			1
now it is emerged that @entity11 has had his hair cut by a celebrity crimper who has styled the likes of @entity130 , @entity140 ’s @entity139 and @entity142 ’s @entity141			1
hairdresser @entity37 has revealed how she gave the @entity50 leader a more ‘ assertive ’ style			1
‘ it 's really nice : quite soft and very thick			2
i 've run my hands through lots of politicians ' hair , but his took me by surprise , ’ she told @entity72			2
miss @entity37 runs a salon in @entity153 but is often called upon to style the stars			1
she first tackled the @entity155 in 2010 , when asked to prepare him for an appearance on @entity157			0
‘ i moved his parting so it sat flatter and made his hair much more assertive , but i do n't think he liked it very much			1
‘ i do n't know if he felt it was too much like his brother 's , but it 's since gone a little bit floppy - haired toff			0
i think we had something very assertive there , but i think what he wants varies depending on how insecure he is			1
’ mr @entity11 is such a fan of his local @entity170 restaurant that the menu declares it to be his favourite			0
he has previously said his favourite meal is a @entity174 - duck , spring rolls , sweet and sour chicken			0
mr @entity11 also appeared uncomfortable when discussing his own circumstances			0
he earns £ 139,000 as leader of the opposition , and his wife @entity73 is reported to earn £ 200,000 - a - year as a lawyer			1
their home is said to be worth more £ 2million			0
mr @entity11 conceded : ‘ i am relatively comfortably off , but what i know is that there are deep issues that need to be tackled			0
’ the @entity50 leader suffered further humiliation in a subsequent radio interview because he did not know the name of the @entity191 leader at a battleground council			1
his blunders were seized on by the @entity194 , who accused him of being a ‘ champagne socialist ’			0
the interviews made for a day of woe for mr @entity11 as voters prepare to go to the polls tomorrow for @entity202 and local council elections			0
he has been under pressure after two polls last week put the @entity194 ahead for the first time in two years			0
he hopes to draw a line under interest in his own spending with a new focus on @entity50 policies ahead of local and @entity212 elections tomorrow			0
he is embarking on a 10 visits - taking him from @entity124 to his @entity215 constituency via towns in the @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 & @entity221			1
the @entity50 leader added : ' if i have heard one message most of all in this campaign , it is the depths of discontent about the way the country is run			2
' the challenges go beyond this government			0
and people are asking whether any political party can turn it round ? ' can anyone rebuild the link between a hard day 's work and ordinary family finances ? ' that link that used to be the foundation of our country 's prosperity			0
that used to guarantee the people of this country a decent life for them and their families			0
' my answer is that @entity50 can and @entity50 will			0
people should vote @entity50 on thursday to make @entity253 better than this			0
vote @entity50 to make your family better off			0
' @entity50 has attempted to show that despite the economic recovery , ordinary people are not feeling better off			0
following the @entity91 interview yesterday morning , mr @entity11 attempted to correct his blunder , saying his overall shopping bill would be ‘ slightly higher ’ than he suggested			1
the correction backfired because he implied that the £ 70 or £ 80 was for ‘ basic fruit and vegetables ’			1
speaking on @entity264 , he said : ‘ well , i said this morning it was on the basic groceries , the basic fruit and vegetables , about £ 70 or £ 80 – the total shopping bill was slightly higher than that , obviously			1
’ mr @entity11 was tackled about his finances during a difficult interview on @entity91 's @entity90 mr @entity11 ’s day then got worse during an interview on @entity274 in which he was shown to lack knowledge of local politicians			0
@entity277 , the interviewer , asked him what he made of ‘ @entity279 ’ without saying who he was			0
mr @entity11 asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no idea who he was talking about , and asked the presenter to ‘ enlighten ’ him			0
in a toe - curling exchange , mr @entity277 told him mr @entity279 was the @entity286 on @entity288 council			0
mr @entity11 then blundered again by referring to mr @entity279 as the leader of @entity288 council , when in fact the council is controlled by conservatives			2
flailing , mr @entity11 said : ‘ i think he is doing a good job for @entity50 on the council			0
’ @entity295 mp @entity294 said : ‘ @entity11 has sealed his credentials as an out of touch champagne socialist who has no idea how hard - working people live			0
' the @entity50 leader is the man without a plan , stumbling from opportunist gimmick to gimmick , with policies unravelling by the day			1
even his own mps do n’t trust him			0
