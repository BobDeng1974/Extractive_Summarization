@entity0 annexed by the @entity1 , the rest of @entity3 at risk as @entity7 troops mass on its borders … it is not as if the world ’s leaders do not have enough real - life international problems to keep them busy			2
nevertheless , with the crisis deepening in the east , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity14 and @entity16 president @entity15 ended up playing a computer game dubbed ‘ nukes on the loose ’ at a conference this week			1
‘ it could be the @entity46 , or @entity47 , @entity48 or anywhere , ’ the 53 world leaders at the @entity30 were told			1
the game , split across four three - minute videos , involves terrorists stealing nuclear material from an unidentified country which has not properly secured its stockpile			1
they use uranium to build a bomb which could kill millions of people if unleashed			0
with the clock ticking , mr @entity20 and his fellow leaders – each playing the game on touch screen computers – had to figure out what to do			1
asked about the threat @entity7 poses to world security , @entity19 said he was more worried about a rogue attack @entity20 held discussions with @entity70 secretary general @entity69 during the summit at the @entity40 after each video , they made their decision from four options and the answers were shared anonymously with the group for discussion			2
the leaders were reported to have enjoyed the video game and president @entity19 even told delegates that the @entity82 regularly performs similar exercises			2
he had @entity82 ’s top adviser on weapons of mass destruction , @entity88 - @entity87 , at his side during the game but the other leaders were alone			2
however , among all the excitable men , there was at least one leader who raised an eyebrow at the proceedings			0
@entity97 chancellor @entity14 was said to have been apprehensive taking part in a role - playing game about such a serious issue , especially alone , whereas in real life she would have advisers			2
@entity97 chancellor @entity14 was said to be slightly out of her depth during the video games because she was without her usual advisers but while she normally plays hardball in negotiations , in this case she was talked around			0
the summit ’s @entity38 organisers said it was the first time they had tried anything like this , but felt the ‘ interactive approach ’ was successful and the participants were ‘ enthusiastic ’			0
@entity30 spokesman @entity118 said it was a ‘ fictitious but realistic scenario ’ and the right outcome was achieved by countries working together			1
‘ it was quite innovative and not the convention in a summit like this , ’ he added			0
‘ usually the leaders of delegations just make a statement			0
[ but ] the leaders debated freely			0
’ a diplomatic source told @entity131 that the nukes video game was actually a tough test for leaders			1
‘ it put them on the spot , ’ said the source			0
‘ should they inform the public or keep them in the dark ? should they work with other countries or stand alone to try to thwart the attack ? the leaders were asked about whether they would keep the crisis private or go public , whether they would work together or stand alone , and how to bring the human cost down to an ' acceptable ' level ‘ how should they make the cold calculation of how to get a more sustainable human cost in terms of deaths ? ’ the video game has been compared to the 1983 @entity154 thriller @entity152 , starring @entity155 as a hacker who accesses a @entity82 military super-computer , nearly triggering a nuclear war			1
a @entity161 source said : ‘ the pm liked the interactive style and the fact that leaders were confronted with different events they had to respond to			0
’ the nukes game was played on monday , the first day of the summit , which is aimed at discussing ways to protect the world from nuclear weapons .			1

@entity30 leaders asked to play ' nukes on the loose ' game
it involved four three minutes videos based on fake nuclear crisis
leaders were asked to watch clips and then submit anonymous responses
asked whether they would keep crisis private or go public , how they would *minimise* *civilians* *causalities* and whether to work with other countries
answers were then used as a basis for a debate afterwards
