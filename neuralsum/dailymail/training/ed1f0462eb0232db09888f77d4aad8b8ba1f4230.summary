by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 18:56 est , 10 december 2013 the controversial low - calorie artificial sweetener , aspartame , has been cleared by @entity4 food experts as ‘ safe for human consumption ’			1
the move has been welcomed by manufacturers , who have been using the sugar alternative in fizzy drinks , such as @entity11 , and snacks for 30 years			1
however , one leading @entity14 expert has accused the @entity4 experts of failing consumers and being biased in favour of the food industry			1
@entity19 : the move has been welcomed by manufacturers , who have been using the sugar alternative in fizzy drinks , such as @entity11 , and snacks for 30 years @entity26 has come under suspicion as a result of research studies drawing links to everything from allergic reactions to cancer and premature births			1
however , a study by experts on behalf of the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , has found it has no harmful effects			2
@entity36 said yesterday : ‘ @entity26 and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure			1
’ the chairman of the expert panel which assessed the sweetener , dr @entity45 ( correct ) @entity46 , said : ‘ this opinion represents one of the most comprehensive risk assessments of aspartame ever undertaken			1
‘ it ’s a step forward in strengthening consumer confidence in the scientific underpinning of the @entity56 food safety system and the regulation of food additives			1
’ concerns about artificial sweeteners , such as aspartame , have centred on the fact that they contain methanol			1
methanol is a nerve toxin , which can be metabolised in the body to form formic acid , which is another nerve toxin , as well as formaldehyde , which is the chemical used to preserve dead bodies			2
suspicion : @entity26 has come under suspicion as a result of research studies drawing links to everything from allergic reactions to cancer and premature births however , the @entity36 panel said methanol is also found in other foods such as fruit and vegetables , while the exposure related to consuming aspartame was ‘ low ’			1
the findings of @entity36 echo the results of a study published by @entity14 ’s @entity90 last week , which found no evidence of harm as a result of human feeding trials			2
human guinea pigs were fed cereal snack bars , some of which contained the artificial sweetener , by a team of researchers at @entity102			2
the study recruited 50 people who had reported reactions after consuming aspartame in the past , such as headaches and nausea			0
however , the investigation found no evidence of harm			0
@entity111 , the professor of @entity112 at the @entity113 , questioned the validity of the @entity36 conclusions			0
he said the @entity36 panel set up to carry out the safety assessment was dominated by experts linked to manufacturers or regulators that have previously supported aspartame			0
‘ i am very disappointed but not remotely surprised , ’ he said			1
‘ the announcement demonstrates that the @entity36 panel on food additives is biased in favour of the chemical and food industries and can not be relied on to protect or promote consumer interests or public health			2
’ the professor pointed to several studies that raise questions about the safety of aspartame and justify the need for further research			0
an @entity56 funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby			0
the professor also highlighted work by the independent @entity145 in @entity146 , which has published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans			0
the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) welcomed the @entity36 opinion and quoted professor @entity156 , from the @entity157 , supporting the decision			0
prof @entity156 reassured consumers , saying : ‘ the food industry is a very closely regulated sector			2
the @entity162 on @entity163 added to @entity164 is made up of excellent experts from a wide range of disciplines who have analysed and assessed all available data			0
‘ people should be confident that the data reviewed is the most up - to - date and that the @entity36 opinion is based on all existing scientific facts			0
@entity26 is a simple compound made from two amino acids and a methyl group , all of which occur naturally in the diet and are consumed in larger amounts from other normal dietary sources			0

has been used as sugar alternative for 30 years
