could @entity0 and @entity1 lead @entity2 out on the first morning of the @entity3 ? that would create some noise among the spectators gathered in the wonderful amphitheatre that has been created around the first tee , would n’t it ? @entity0 and @entity1 were the fourballs partnership that changed everything at @entity12 , of course , but @entity2 captain @entity14 will be all too aware of the perils associated with such a pairing as well			1
it might be a decade ago but nobody as steeped in @entity3 lore as the @entity20 will forget what happened when the @entity22 paired @entity23 and @entity24 in 2004			1
when they were beaten comfortably it was such a psychological blow it set the tone for a record - breaking defeat			0
could @entity0 and @entity1 lead @entity2 out on the first morning of the @entity3 on friday imagine what a boost it would give the visitors if a @entity22 partnership took down that talismanic pairing ? a move that ’s not without risk for @entity14 , therefore , but one he appears to be leaning towards			1
one of those where you look like a genius if it works and get pilloried if it does n’t			0
two partnerships seem fairly set for the opening morning			0
near neighbours @entity44 and @entity46 will almost certainly be partners , as will @entity49 and @entity48			0
two more players whose form this season warrants action on the first morning are @entity52 and @entity53			0
why not those two great mates @entity1 and @entity54 ? they are at their best in foursomes and will team up in the afternoon			1
the @entity22 ? again , two partnerships are cast in stone			1
@entity59 and @entity24 and @entity60 and @entity61 will see action			2
when @entity23 and @entity24 were paired at the @entity64 they were beaten comfortably who plays with @entity66 is the big question and @entity70 , at 20 the youngest player on either team , would be an exciting answer			1
if that goes well you could see the two of them playing all five matches			0
veteran @entity77 would be a prosaic alternative , with @entity79 and one of the rookies — @entity82 or @entity83 — completing the morning line - up			0
by all means , play the game yourself at home			0
how do you counter all the songs of the @entity2 fans who will gather from first light around the first tee ? the @entity22 players are hoping their supporters will follow the lead of their ‘ soccer ’ fans at the @entity99 and adopt the chant : ‘ we believe that we can win			2
’ @entity22 captain @entity102 said : ‘ there will be some noise out there			1
but it ’s hard to see the @entity22 , who do n’t really go in for singing , getting much of a look in			2
how @entity14 performs at the @entity3 could determine who is chosen as a future @entity2 captain video pundits provide insight into potential pairings when @entity14 was made @entity2 ’s captain it marked a shift away from the recent tradition of skippers being either proven major winners or larger - than - life personalities			1
when @entity102 was given the @entity22 equivalent , it ended the practice of the @entity22 captaincy being handed to distinguished former players whose careers had just come to a natural end			1
the fate of the two incumbents this week , therefore , will go beyond the usual cartoonish portrayal that sees one depicted as @entity132 and the loser as captain cock - up			2
what happens at @entity137 will go a long way to determining future captains on both sides			1
if @entity2 lose the clamour to turn the clock back and go for a @entity143 or a @entity144 will be considerable			0
but if @entity2 win and @entity14 plays a blinder , it will create a template and help considerably the chances of solid members of the tour citizenry like @entity152 and @entity153			2
@entity22 @entity3 captain @entity102 said this they will use this tournament to make up for @entity12 @entity22 took a huge gamble with @entity61			1
knowing the players well , as @entity14 does , is supposed to be a key part of the job but @entity61 will rule with brush strokes and rely on the respect he undoubtedly commands			2
how that works out could well determine whether his successor is another legend … or a @entity167 loyalist			0
quote of the week ‘ i ’ve made it very clear to my team that this is a redemption trip			0
it ’s time for us to make amends for what happened at @entity12			1
’ @entity22 captain @entity102 spells out his theme			1
at @entity12 last time it was the spirit of @entity180 that infused the @entity2 team			2
here at @entity182 has ensured that popular coach @entity183 , his own mentor and someone who lent a guiding hand to so many before he passed away in july , will not be forgotten			0
before any of his players left the practice range and went to the first tee at a tournament , @entity186 would shake their hands and tell them : ‘ happiest days of your lives			0
’ those are the last words any @entity2 player will see before he leaves the team room and makes his way to the first tee .			0

@entity1 and @entity0 could be paired together in @entity3
pairing could be compared to @entity24 and @entity23 in 2004
@entity14 *'s* *performance* could decide fate of future captains
@entity102 says @entity22 are here to make up for @entity12
