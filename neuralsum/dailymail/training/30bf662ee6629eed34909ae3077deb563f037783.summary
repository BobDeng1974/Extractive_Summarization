sir @entity0 may have rhapsodised about playing tennis with @entity2 , who had ‘ the speed of a swallow , the grace of a boy ’			2
but the modern tennis heroine has rather more weapons in her arsenal — and we are not just talking about ability on the court			2
@entity13 , 20 years old and @entity14 , is gloriously blonde with perfectly regular , brilliantly white film - star teeth , a pair of oiled thighs that could crack walnuts , half a million fans on @entity20 — and a @entity22 profile which ranges from the flirtatious to the , frankly , provocative			1
indeed , the new face of women ’s tennis — who will be fighting to be crowned @entity28 champion today — likes to post pictures of herself lounging seductively in bikinis and pouting in fancy dress			1
@entity42 , money - making and with an ambition and drive which make the rest of the tennis crowd — no offence @entity48 — look like a bunch of shuffling amateurs			2
her smitten fans , known as the @entity52 , follow her around the globe and , in a mawkish display of puppy love , throw teddy bears on to the court , some with proposals of marriage attached			0
adorable though she may be , @entity13 can also be utterly ruthless — in a charming way — when it comes to fulfilling her role as champ - in - waiting			1
for example , she was once best friends with @entity36 tennis hope @entity35 , who is also 20			1
they met aged nine and were inseparable for a decade			0
they were once so close that @entity69 stayed with @entity70 at her family home near the @entity73 when they played there			1
as teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars — including @entity48 — performing @entity80 dance moves			1
bffs no more : when asked if she was close with @entity70 anymore , @entity13 said : ' no. i do n't think so			1
i 'm sure you guys can figure out that one ... i 'll leave it at that ' tight bond : as teenagers @entity13 would stay at @entity70 's house when she played at @entity28 but there has been an acrimonious falling out			1
asked yesterday if they were still close , @entity13 responded bluntly : ‘ no. i do n’t think so , ’ adding ‘ i ’m sure you guys can figure out that one			1
i ’ll leave it at that			0
’ the rift is believed to be over @entity97 , the leading coach who runs the @entity99 tennis academy where they first met			1
while the pair previously shared his services , he now coaches @entity13 exclusively			1
their friendship has deteriorated further during the past year as @entity13 accelerated ahead of her former friend			1
she has climbed into the tennis top ranks , while @entity70 peaked when she reached the fourth round of last year ’s @entity28 , then missed this year ’s championships with a wrist injury			1
she now languishes at 91 in the world rankings			2
tennis insiders say the girls no longer speak , let alone post pictures of themselves together on social networking sites as they once did so regularly			2
but the duo , pictured in june last year at the @entity117 party , reportedly fell out after their joint coach @entity97 started to work with @entity13 exclusively before the @entity119 , @entity13 said she did n’t have a best friend : ‘ i do n’t think the tennis tour is the place to have friends			1
for me it ’s all competition			0
’ where her twin sister @entity125 is concerned , @entity13 says they are ‘ opposites ’ and ‘ very different ’			1
@entity125 , she adds , ‘ retired from tennis aged six ’ , and they see little of each other as @entity13 criss - crosses the globe in search of sporting glory			1
@entity125 , a student , is the older by six minutes			0
speaking to reporters , she claimed to have a telepathic link with @entity13 and broke into a broad smile over her sister ’s achievements			1
‘ every day i am just in awe , ’ she said			0
‘ i have seen everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years			2
she has sacrificed a lot to get where she is today			0
’ @entity13 has self - belief and focus by the bucketload			1
when she met tennis legend @entity147 at an event in @entity149 in january , she was far from over-awed			2
@entity147 tweeted : ‘ @ @entity150 has informed me that there are more cameras focused on her			0
’ by the end of the day they were apparently friends , and @entity147 wrote : ‘ ok , spent the whole day with @ @entity156 : genuine , mature , determined , and really funny ! ! ! ’ or , as she told a reporter that day , more bluntly : ‘ she is as tough as nails			2
’ so who is @entity13 ? born on february 25 , 1994 , in @entity161 , she is the product of a wealthy suburban upbringing			1
her father @entity164 , known as @entity165 , is an investment banker , and mum @entity166 is a great fan of the @entity167 — which is why she called her twin girls @entity13 and @entity125			2
‘ when i was young my mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and i still keep it on my bedside table , ’ @entity13 says			2
her younger brother is named @entity174 after prince @entity174 and the eldest of the siblings is @entity176 , after princess @entity177 of @entity178			0
home was in the posh suburb of @entity181 — in the same street as former @entity14 prime minister @entity183			2
the children were introduced to tennis at a young age , but @entity13 , then aged five , detested the ‘ childish ’ games involving hula hoops and balloons that were supposed to interest them in the sport			1
the @entity14 player , who is becoming the face of women 's tennis has an army of fans dubbed ' @entity197 ' , faces no 6 seed @entity199 tomorrow in the women 's singles final at @entity28 fist pump : @entity13 celebrates a point in her match against @entity206 's @entity205 during the @entity208 semi-finals on july 3 ‘ all of the kids , including my sister , loved the games , except me , ’ she told the @entity210 newspaper			1
‘ i hated them , i just wanted to hit more balls and actually play tennis			2
‘ eventually , i started playing three times a week , then took private lessons and played my first tournament aged eight			0
i loved it right away			0
’ extraordinarily , this was when she decided that tennis was to be her life			2
‘ @entity223 is very young to decide what you want to do in life , but that is pretty much when i decided , ’ she said			0
when she was 12 , @entity13 had the chance to move to @entity99 to train with coach @entity97 at his academy			1
the whole family relocated to @entity99 from @entity161 — and moved back a few years later , after @entity231 agreed to pay for an exclusive trainer for her in @entity161			2
she continues to train with @entity97 in @entity99 for part of the year , and spends the rest of it on the tour , going home to @entity161 for visits when she can			1
fancy dress : tennis star @entity13 , 20 , right , pictured with her twin sister @entity125 in ' sexy policewomen ' costume @entity244 — like the parents of champs @entity246 and @entity248 — has taken a hands - on approach to building his daughter ’s sporting career , sometimes with excessive zeal			1
@entity13 tried to claim thousands that he personally spent on his daughter ’s dream in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 as business losses against tax — but @entity14 ’s tax service disallowed it			1
an embarrassing episode perhaps , but @entity13 continued her march to tennis glory			1
she won @entity28 in 2012 and last year was named @entity265 tennis newcomer of the year			1
she reached the semis of the @entity267 in january and the @entity268			0
her prize money to date stands at £ 1 million — her greater earnings come from endorsements , which so far include @entity272 and @entity273 , and she has been in @entity274 and other fashion magazines			0
she is now being courted by watch manufacturers , jewellery designers , clothes labels and banks			0
@entity48 , the best financially rewarded female athlete on the planet , netted £ 15 million last year with her deals with @entity282 , @entity283 , et al			0
@entity13 ’s agent , @entity285 , is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world			1
‘ she ’s got the personality , she ’s got the game , she ’s got the looks , ’ he said			0
‘ she speaks two languages [ @entity292 and @entity293 ] and the crossover appeal is great			0
@entity296 fans love her , @entity292 fans love her			0
’ ‘ she understands that the better she plays tennis , the more money , the more marketable and the more famous she will be			0
but it ’s all centred on the tennis			0
’ @entity302 , of sports agency @entity303 , agrees that @entity13 could unseat the glorious @entity48 as the game ’s top earner			2
her use of social media already sets her apart and makes her all the more valuable as a commodity			0
she is , online at least , an unabashed flirt — posting a selfie with the actor @entity311 earlier this year ; a picture of herself on her birthday , lying on her bed surrounded by flowers and birthday wishes ; and one on @entity318 with a hand - drawn card : ‘ from me , to me			0
’ all of which makes her fans love her even more			0
she is , though , apparently quietly going out with @entity323 ice hockey player @entity322 , who plays for a @entity14 team			1
before that she was dating @entity296 tennis star @entity326			0
she faces no 6 seed @entity199 today as @entity14 ’s first @entity328 singles finalist at @entity28 , and is brimming with confidence			1
‘ it ’s not a surprise to me			0
i expect to be in these finals			0
i totally feel like i belong			0
i want to make my own history			0
’ as well as her own millions .			0

@entity14 @entity13 , 20 , will compete in @entity28 singles final
she and @entity36 player @entity35 were best friends for ten years
but the pair fell out , reportedly about their former coach @entity97
friendship deteriorated as @entity13 flew up the rankings ahead of @entity70
@entity13 said : ' i do n't think the tennis tour is the place to have friends '
