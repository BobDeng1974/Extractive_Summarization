possibility : the idea that @entity2 , 29 , of @entity3 , might have ordered the attack - or even led it herself - is not far - fetched at all last night , as the bodies were still being counted at the shopping mall , one @entity6 woman was notably slow to join the condemnation			1
for @entity2 , the daughter of a former @entity6 soldier who grew up attending school discos in @entity3 , views these awful events as a cause for jubilation			1
@entity16 anti-terror police revealed yesterday that @entity2 - who is known to many as the @entity2 - may be the brains behind the operation to bring terror to the heart of @entity16 , a country once synonymous with the sexual high - jinks of the @entity24 expatriate set , but rapidly becoming a new battleground in the war between @entity27 and the @entity28			2
‘ i suspect this woman @entity2 is behind this attack , ’ a senior anti-terror source told me last night as survivors described how a woman in a veil appeared to be commanding the other terrorists as they hunted down and killed non-muslim shoppers			1
the idea that she might have ordered the attack – or even led it herself – is not far - fetched at all			0
having converted to @entity27 as a young woman and married a man who went on to be a 7/7 @entity46 suicide bomber , she has become a key figure in the terror group behind this weekend ’s attack			1
@entity2 has even been involved in training a group of all - female suicide attackers at camps in lawless neighbouring @entity54			1
the pair married three years later			0
when her husband was named as one of four suicide bombers who blew up tube trains and a bus in 2005 , killing 52 people , @entity2 initially condemned her late husband ’s attack and denied any knowledge of his plan			1
more than eight years later , @entity2 is one of @entity89 ’s main recruiters in @entity90 and is an official spokesman for @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , the terrorist group behind the horror in @entity65			1
as well as railing against ‘ infidels in the @entity28 ’ , @entity2 had previously used a @entity98 account to denounce a rival foreign terrorist in the text - speak of a teenager			1
‘ @entity105 [ for your information ] sam lewthwaite thinks u r a irritating obnoxious contemptible little @entity107 , ’ she wrote			0
( ‘ @entity111 ’ is a contraction of mujahideen – a jihadist )			0
backup : more soldiers from the @entity114 arrived to strengthen the already large numbers of troops available to deal with the siege at the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity16 the object of her anger was @entity121 , a former student from @entity122			2
last week he was shot dead in an ambush by terrorists loyal to the @entity2			2
‘ may his fate serve as a lesson to all those who want to follow in his footsteps as a poster boy for jihad , ’ @entity2 wrote gleefully on @entity98			2
teenage years : @entity2 grew up attending school discos in @entity3 to add to her name for ruthlessness , the @entity2 did not mention in her tweets that a @entity6 man reputed to be her second husband was also killed in the ambush			1
her fearless reputation within @entity90 ’s growing @entity27 terror network has been strengthened by her own involvement as a mujahid – or warrior – during a series of bombings and shootings in @entity16 ’s tourist areas			0
known to her devoted followers as dada muzungu – swahili for white sister – @entity2 moved to @entity16 with her three children in 2007			2
a small , dumpy woman , she cut off all links with her family in @entity6 and became immersed in @entity90 ’s @entity27 terror networks , forging links with other @entity6 fanatics who had come to @entity16 to wage ‘ jihad ’ against non-believers			2
it was last year that details of @entity2 ’s secret new life emerged in grisly detail			0
a white woman , later identified as @entity2 , had led a group of terrorists who fired grenades into a bar in @entity170 , the @entity16 coastal tourist resort popular with @entity6			1
three people , including a child , were killed and more than 50 injured			0
in truth , i was deeply sceptical when news was first leaked two years ago about the @entity2 ’s alleged role as a terrorist with the group now causing carnage in @entity65			1
yet now , having spent time among her acolytes in the @entity27 stronghold where she once lived near @entity170 , and in briefings with police , prosecutors and senior investigators during subsequent investigations in @entity65 , i have no doubt that @entity2 is a cold - blooded killer and a dangerous ideologue			1
senior officers in @entity16 have told me they will kill her on sight			0
so far , however , she has avoided arrest by wearing all - concealing @entity27 dress as she has flitted between @entity54 , @entity16 and @entity196			0
former home : the 29 - year - old grew up as a normal teenager in @entity71 ( file picture ) , @entity3 , before meeting a @entity201 in an online chat room when she was 17			1
the pair married three years later meanwhile , the group she is allied to continues to wreak havoc in the region			0
@entity92 grew out of the chaos of @entity54 , and has seen jihadists wage a brutal war to impose strict sharia law in the @entity90 state			0
' i suspect this woman @entity2 is behind this attack ' senior anti-terror source but @entity16 forces , supported by @entity6 and @entity217 , have been waging war across the border in @entity54 in an attempt to keep the @entity27 from power			1
with the war against @entity92 in @entity54 proving highly effective , @entity16 ’s support has made it a key enemy of the @entity27			0
even before this weekend ’s attack , the activities of @entity2 and her fellow terrorists had turned @entity16 into a place of fear and paranoia			2
clearly , the @entity2 has a taste for blood			0
it remains to be seen whether she will live long enough to kill again .			0
