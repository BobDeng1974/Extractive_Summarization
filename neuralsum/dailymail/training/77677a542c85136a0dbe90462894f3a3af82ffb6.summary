by @entity0 pet owners in @entity2 are being told to keep a close eye on their four - legged friends after hundreds of dog remains were found near the border of @entity7			1
it is thought the dog remains , made up of hundreds of skins and bones which had been abandoned in a forest in @entity13 , northeastern @entity2 , were destined for @entity14 and @entity15			1
there , dog meat is considered a delicacy , but is also used to make leather products – in particular golf gloves made from canine testicles			2
in danger : smugglers kidnap pet dogs as they are easier to catch than strays , and sell the skin to leather manufacturers in @entity15 and @entity14 the find was made last month by @entity2 police , who revealed the purpose of the practice , which is illegal in @entity2			1
‘ the skins would be bleached - some are then sent ( by smugglers ) to other countries to be made into gloves for playing golf , ’ @entity33 , from a special police unit to suppress smuggling and the trade in animal parts , told @entity38			0
' extra soft ' : the skin from dogs ' testicles are used to make golfing gloves ' experts say that dog skins are also used for instruments such as drums			1
’ mr @entity33 said the find is linked to the march raids on two makeshift factories in the area where smugglers would strip skin from dogs and preserve the meat			0
dog skin is highly sought after by manufacturers of golf gloves , predominantly the skin from the testicles as it is particularly soft , @entity61 , co-founder and vice-president of @entity2 dog welfare organisation @entity63 , told @entity69			1
although there are thousands of stray dogs in @entity2 ’s many large cities , smugglers prefer domestic pets as they are easier to catch , mr @entity61 says			0
‘ stray dogs are extremely difficult to catch			0
it ’s far easier to catch pet dogs or unwanted service dogs , ’ he says , adding that the illegal dog trade is extremely cruel			0
mr @entity61 , who has lived in @entity2 for over a decade , says dogs are often packed into cages before being dragged out and skinned alive			0
local campaign group @entity82 confirmed that dog skin is used for golf gloves , hats and wallets and that smugglers will offer to pay around $ 10 for a live dog , including pets and strays			2
brutal : it is illegal to kill dogs for meat in @entity2 , but many take the risk to make money off the lucrative market in @entity15			2
