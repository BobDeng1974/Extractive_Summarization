it was never about money , i wanted to make sure this does n't happen again			0
' at the time i thought the hospital was doing everything they could to help mum , but after she died i had a gut feeling that something was n't quite how it should be , and i was right			2
' the death certificate said she died from internal bleeding and i later discovered she should have been given a ppi which would have stopped this			2
' my mum lost her life unnecessarily			0
i just wanted to get justice for my mum and now i 've got that			0
' my mum was a proud woman			0
she never wanted a fuss			0
' before she became ill she was very independent , she would come shopping with us and visit all the time			0
' but after she collapsed the first time she was in excruciating pain and that never went away until the day she died			0
