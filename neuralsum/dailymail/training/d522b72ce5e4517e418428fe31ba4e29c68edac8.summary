by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 3 january 2013 he 's used to having the best of everything , so it 's unlikely @entity6 football club owner @entity5 enjoyed battling for space to anchor his super yacht off the coast of @entity10			1
the tycoon was forced to moor his white luxury yacht @entity12 just a stone 's throw away from the huge blue ship owned by @entity18 's prime minister and foreign minister @entity19			1
and with the two yachts anchored @entity22 in front of the harbor @entity25 on the @entity27 island , the battle was on for which billionaire has the nicest boat with the most luxury , helicopters , and jet skis			0
battle of the super yachts : billionaire @entity5 got to size up the competition after anchoring his white ship @entity12 ( back ) next to the @entity36 owned by the emir of @entity18 @entity19 @entity38 rich : the two yachts are owned by the world 's 50th richest man @entity5 , pictured left , and @entity18 's prime minister and foreign minister @entity19 , pictured right @entity5 's £ 1billion yacht @entity12 is the world 's largest privately owned yacht at 557ft long - beating the @entity36 which is a mere 436ft ( but still longer than a football pitch )			1
despite being smaller than the @entity12 , the @entity36 is still one of the world 's largest and was named the second most beautiful yacht across the globe after it was built in 2008			2
the yacht can accommodate 24 guests in 10 guest suites with two vip suites for the yacht owner , the emir of @entity18 , as well as a further 55 rooms to house the staff needed to man the ship			2
the suites are large and each has its own bathroom , living room and double bedroom			0
size is n't everything : the @entity36 is more than 100ft shorter than @entity12 but still longer than a football pitch the height of luxury : the @entity36 has 10 luxury guest suites that each come with its own bedroom , bathroom and living room the boat boasts a cinema , outside bars , inside swimming pool , outside jacuzzi , sunbathing places and a helicopter pad			0
the yacht also has all the usual equipment for watersport entertainment and numerous jet skies and boys ' toys			0
but @entity5 , who was visiting the island for his annual @entity90 at his @entity92 estate , has made sure his vessel is kitted out to be the ultimate in super yacht luxury			2
the @entity12 has two swimming pools , two helicopter pads , a dedicated disco hall , around 30 cabins , a mini-submarine , and even a missile defence system			0
the vessel has eighty members of staff to operate the craft who all wear discreet tan uniforms while on board			0
big competition : @entity5 's @entity12 is the largest private yacht in the world at 557ft and has around 30 individual suites powerful : the @entity12 has two swimming pools , two helicopter pads , a disco hall , a mini-submarine and a missile defence system when the ship was ordered the initial cost was estimated at around £ 330million , but by the time mr @entity5 took delivery in 2010 it was spiralling towards the £ 1billion mark because of the extra luxury fittings and security measures			1
mr @entity5 , 46 , who has six children with his first wife @entity124 and girlfriend @entity124 , uses his fleet of luxury boats to travel around the world and to get to his large estate on the island where he has hosted @entity90 parties for the last four years			2
the world 's rich and famous descend on @entity10 for the bash - which often cost several million - at the 70 - acre estate			1
as @entity19 arrived in his ship in time for the party , it seems he may have been one of the many influential guests of @entity5 - now the 5th richest person in @entity139 and the 50th richest person in the world			0
on the guest list : the two ships , @entity12 back and @entity36 front , were both pictured moored off the coast of the @entity27 island of @entity10 where @entity5 holds his annual @entity90 parties party like no other : celebs were treated to a massive fireworks display ( pictured last year ) at @entity5 's 70 - acre @entity10 estate @entity152 @entity152 's luxury yacht : the music mogul 's @entity155 cruiser , where he is currently residing in the @entity27 , is 196 ft long , accommodates 12 guests plus a crew of 14 and costs $ 450,000 per week to charter @entity160 and twitter founder @entity161 battle of the boats : model @entity164 is currently holidaying in @entity10 with @entity166 founder @entity161 on super yacht @entity167 , which is 160ft long and accommodates 12 guests with a crew of 10 , worth $ 275,000 a week @entity172 party boat : @entity174 is currently in @entity10 on his luxury yacht ' @entity176 ' , where he invited numerous celebrity pals to spend @entity90			1

the @entity6 owner travelled to the island on his £ 1billion yacht @entity12 for his @entity90 at his luxury 70 - acre estate
but fellow guests - such as @entity18 's prime minister - had already got the best spot in their own super yachts
