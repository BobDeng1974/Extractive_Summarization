by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 20 august 2013 a maths teacher and his students have confirmed what many cookie lovers have long suspected – there simply is n’t as much creme filling in @entity7 and @entity8 as the manufacturers claim			1
@entity10 , who teaches at a high school in @entity12 , @entity13 , decided the confusion surrounding @entity16 fillings would be the perfect case study to engage his students in using maths in real life			1
@entity10 , 32 , brought one package each of regular @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity21 to class			1
a maths teacher and his students have confirmed what many cookie lovers have long suspected ¿ there simply is n't as much creme filling in @entity7 as the manufacturers claim the students weighed ten @entity8 , left , and ten @entity16 , right he then split his students into different groups , with some measuring the cookies ' height and some their weight			1
‘ we weighed 10 of each - @entity7 , @entity21 and regular , ’ he told @entity35			2
‘ and we weighed five wafers alone to deduct from the total			0
’ using mathematical equations to determine the creme content of the cookies , @entity10 's students found that the bigger oreos did n’t include as much filling as their packaging suggested			1
the @entity16 were only 1.86 times the size of regular @entity8 , rather than double as the name suggests			2
according to @entity10 and his students , @entity16 were only 1.86 the size of a regular oreo and @entity8 were 2.68 the size of a regular cookie school teacher @entity10 decided the confusion surrounding @entity16 fillings was a perfect example to engage his students in using maths according to the students ' measurements , the @entity56 had 2.68 times the amount of creme of the regular @entity8			1
while the packaging does n’t get specific about how much creme is in each @entity63 it is fair to say expectations have been set higher than just over two and half times the amount in a regular cookie			0
@entity10 said his students were surprised by their findings , which he has documented on his @entity71 blog			0
@entity72 reached out to @entity73 , which makes @entity8 , for comment about the apparent lack of filling in its cookies			0
they replied , ' while i ’m not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting , i can confirm for you that our recipe for the @entity84 has double the @entity85 , or creme filling when compared with our base , or original @entity63 cookie			2
' @entity10 and his students also weighed 10 regular oreos and five wafers to deduct from the various totals earlier this year @entity93 got into trouble with consumers after one man posted this photo of his not quite footlong sandwich the discovery follows the revelation earlier this year by a man in @entity102 that sandwich chain @entity93 was selling supposed ' footlong ' subs that were just 11 inches in length			0
he posted a photo on @entity108 of his sandwich beside a measuring tape showing that it was a whole inch shorter than advertised			0
subway responded by claiming that the word footlong is a ' registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub ' and ' not intended to be a measurement of length			0

high school maths teacher @entity10 and his students carried out an *experiment* on packs of @entity8 , @entity16 and @entity122
they found that the @entity7 and @entity21 do n't include as much creme filling as their *product* names would lead you to believe
