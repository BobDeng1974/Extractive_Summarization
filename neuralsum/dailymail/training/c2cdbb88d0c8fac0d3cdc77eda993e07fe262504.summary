by @entity1 reporter @entity3 ’s military said saturday that devices it claimed it invented to detect and cure @entity5 and hepatitis c need six more months of testing			1
the army had earlier promised to reveal the technology to the public this coming monday after making what experts dismissed as an outlandish claim last february			2
at a news conference then , the head of the army ’s @entity15 said the military had produced an ' astonishing , miraculous scientific invention ' that could detect @entity5 , hepatitis and other viruses without taking blood samples and also purify the blood of those suffering from the diseases			1
the claim caused uproar among scientists and the public , with many pointing out that it had not been properly verified			1
still six months away apparently : a device the @entity3 army claims will detect and cure @entity5 and @entity34 - seen here on @entity3 state television on february 25 - needs more testing , the army said saturday it was also lampooned in a famous satirical program that has now been taken off the air			1
the claim hit a sensitive nerve in @entity3 , where @entity43 is an epidemic			0
some studies estimate that up to 10 percent of 86 million @entity3 have it , making it the country with the highest prevalence in the world			0
in a press conference held in a military hospital in @entity53 saturday , a military doctor said the devices needed further tests before they could be released to the public			1
' scientific integrity mandates that i delay the start of the public release until the experimentation period is over , to allow for a follow up with patients already using it , ' @entity3 ’s state news agency @entity57 quoted maj. gen. @entity65 , director of the @entity66 , as saying			0
@entity67 said doctors had already started testing one of the machines , the so - called ' @entity71 ' , on 80 @entity43 patients who were also being treated with medication			0
saturday ’s news conference notably dropped any mention of the devices as a cure for @entity5 , only referring to hepatitis			2
the army had earlier promised to reveal the technology to the public this coming monday after making what experts dismissed as an outlandish claim last february			2
they have not elaborated on how the device works the original claim in february raised concerns that the military ’s offer of seemingly inconceivable future devices would draw @entity3 back into a pattern of broken promises by successive rulers who would frequently announce grand initiatives that failed to meet expectations			1
generals working on the project and pro-military media adopted a defensive stance over the matter , insisting that the invention would be released to the public and that any criticism of it was part of a foreign plot to rob @entity3 of a major scientific victory			0
@entity67 said the armed forces will set up a medical center to treat the viruses in the @entity114 province of @entity115 to carry out the tests and declare results .			0
