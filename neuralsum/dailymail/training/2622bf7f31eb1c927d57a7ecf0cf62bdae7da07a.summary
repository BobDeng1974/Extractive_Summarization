by @entity0 as i arrive home these days , my heart starts to beat a little faster			1
after 15 years of marriage , my husband can still bring a flush of excitement to my cheeks and a girlish smile to my lips			1
but it ’s not the prospect of a massage with scented oils that gets my pulse racing , or the long , lingering kisses he surprises me with			2
it ’s the glorious sight of the bins neatly placed outside the front door , the prospect of crisply - ironed sheets in the laundry room , and the delicious smell of a home - cooked meal in the kitchen			2
my husband has become a domestic god — and , to me , that ’s pure romance			1
new regime : claire at home with husband @entity32 trust me , there is nothing more erotic than the sight of your husband in a pinny to re-spark a dormant libido			1
last week , a report revealed couples who divide the domestic chores score higher on marital satisfaction and are more likely to stay together than those who do n’t			1
i could have saved the @entity46 researchers a lot of time and money based on my findings alone			2
how ? well , a year ago , fed up with @entity32 ’s chronic untidiness and refusal to help in the house , i went on strike for a week			1
now i am convinced it is the best thing i ever did			2
it most certainly saved our marriage			2
our relationship had become toxic			2
@entity32 is a photographer , mostly working at night			1
i have a stressful job as a newspaper executive			2
yet the responsibility for caring for our children , @entity62 , age 14 , and ten - year - old @entity64 , plus the shopping , cooking and cleaning , had been dumped firmly on my shoulders			1
a typical day ? after a ten - hour shift at work in @entity74 , i ’d commute for two hours back to our house in @entity77			2
i ’d return exhausted , only to find piles of dirty laundry , two hungry , dirty children , and @entity32 sitting in front of the computer surrounded by discarded @entity84 wrappers — his evening meal of choice			1
at bedtime , i was rarely in the mood for sex			2
@entity32 and i would exchange a few barbed comments and we ’d climb glumly into bed , before sleeping back - to - back without touching i never liked to cause a scene in front of the children , so would inwardly seethe as i supervised bedtime , cooked and tidied up			1
it was n’t unusual for me to still be wearing my coat as i ironed school shirts and stacked the dishwasher at 10.30 pm — i was so busy i ’d forget to take it off on my return			2
hardly surprising , then , that at bedtime , i was rarely in the mood for sex			2
@entity32 and i would exchange a few barbed comments — he assuming i was ‘ in a strop about something ’ and not daring to venture further — and we ’d climb glumly into bed , before sleeping back - to - back without touching			1
this could go on for weeks and weeks			2
and it made me sad , comparing this to the exciting early days of our marriage			1
although i never seriously considered leaving @entity32 , i ’d reconciled myself to an existence where we shared a house and surname but little else			1
he was n’t happy either , and was puzzled by my lack of interest in our love life and fed up with my constant nagging			2
pure romance : the couple are both happier since @entity32 became a domestic god the final straw for me came one night exactly a year ago , when i returned home late after a difficult day to find the children watching tv and eating takeaways on the sofa , the house in complete chaos , no milk in the fridge and nothing for me to eat unless i cooked it for myself			1
close to tears , i rang my elder sister			0
she told me things could not continue like this for the sake of my mental and physical health , not to mention the example i was setting the children			0
was it right for @entity62 or @entity64 to see their mother as little more than a skivvy — and an unhappy one ? so i devised a plan			0
for one week , i would leave @entity32 in charge of all things domestic and shut my eyes to the resulting mess			1
i was hoping the shock tactic would force him into action			0
that he would not only appreciate the sheer amount of work it took to run our house , but also see the truth of why i was left feeling so tired and unsexy every evening			0
the house rapidly descended into chaos , with the sink piled high with sticky plates , the children searching for lost pe kits and curtains staying drawn for days			0
the stress and discomfort worked where nagging had singularly failed			0
the penny finally dropped for @entity32 , especially when i wrote about my feelings about the situation at home in this newspaper			1
shocked and hurt , he asked : ‘ what can i do ? ’ i replied : ‘ for a start , you can stop asking me what to do			0
take responsibility for our home			0
’ the next morning , @entity32 leapt out of bed and brought me up a cup of coffee , before making a lovely cooked breakfast			1
he walked @entity64 to school and tidied the kitchen			0
and that evening the house was tidy , he ’d put a wash on , and had even managed to make a risotto instead of buying a pizza			1
but , best of all , the bins had been put out for collection			0
suddenly , instead of feeling like a taken - for - granted domestic slave , i felt pampered and cosseted			1
suddenly , instead of feeling like a taken - for - granted domestic slave , i felt pampered and cosseted			1
no wonder the grateful kiss i gave him turned into something a bit more enthusiastic no wonder the grateful kiss i gave him turned into something a bit more enthusiastic			0
all the same , i was sceptical this was anything more than a one - day wonder			0
@entity32 , after all , is an @entity212 mamma ’s boy and was brought up in a wealthy , aristocratic family where staff did the housework			1
it had simply never occurred to him he would be expected to pitch in after we married			0
as far as he was concerned , it was enough that he pulled in a salary			0
the fact that i brought home the bacon , too , did n’t seem to count			0
however , i had been raised very differently			0
my father was a new man before the term was even invented			0
despite working two jobs , he would always get up in the night to change a nappy , and brought my mother breakfast in bed			0
no wonder , with such different domestic expectations , @entity32 and i had started to @entity233 waited with dread for the moment when he would stop making an effort and we ’d slide back into our unhappy groove			1
but , a year on , that moment has never come			0
now , instead of feeling angry and exploited , i am comforted by the feeling that @entity32 and i work as a team			1
i have learned to temper my perfectionism			0
i still colour - code my underwear but no longer force my standards onto others			0
husbands take note : women will make more effort int he bedroom if you help out around the house @entity254 , instead of nagging , i tempt him to do the housework with gadgets he ’ll enjoy using			1
ever since i brought home a @entity260 breadmaker , he has made fresh loaves for the family every day			1
he recently came home with a carpet cleaner and got to work			0
‘ just look at the dirt i ’ve got out of this carpet , ’ he said proudly afterwards			0
at last @entity32 was taking pride in our home , and this has had a huge impact on the whole family			1
the children see we ’re all responsible for the house , not just me , so they have started helping too			0
@entity64 can tackle a whole basket of ironing			0
@entity62 packs his school bag and , last weekend , made bacon sandwiches for everyone and loaded the dishwasher afterwards			1
but the best thing of all about sharing the domestic load ? our love life has never been better			2
for one thing , i find @entity32 even more attractive , as he ’s physically fitter			1
in the old days , he would lounge about , smoking and eating chocolate , but since doing the housework , he ’s lost a stone			0
we no longer need a gardener and eat fewer takeaways			0
what we save is spent on date nights instead			0
this @entity291 , @entity32 bought me jewellery for the first time			1
and he took me away to a hotel for @entity295			0
also , because he now appreciates everything i do for the family , my nagging is a thing of the past so here ’s my advice to all you husbands out there : if you want your wife to make more of an effort in the bedroom , start by putting some effort yourself into the rest of the house			1
the results may make you the happiest man ever .			2

couples who divide domestic chores have higher marital satisfaction
