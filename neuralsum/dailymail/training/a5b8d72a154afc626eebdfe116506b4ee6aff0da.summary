@entity1 legend @entity0 believes @entity3 captain @entity2 has been subject to unfair criticism following his side ’s slow start to the 2014/15 @entity8 campaign			1
@entity2 was criticised for a lacklustre performance last weekend as @entity1 lost 3 - 1 against @entity10 in a game that saw the midfielder lose possession on 14 different occasions while winning just 25 per cent of his tackles			1
the 34 - year - old has played every minute of @entity1 ’s campaign so far , which has seen the @entity20 club lose three of their opening five @entity8 games , but @entity0 believes @entity2 ca n’t be the only player to shoulder the blame			1
@entity0 says it is unfair for @entity2 to be the only one criticised for @entity1 's recent results @entity0 played for @entity1 for 10 years and scored 84 @entity8 goals for the club speaking at the unveiling of @entity31 ’s new @entity30 lighting system , @entity0 told @entity32 : ‘ to say @entity2 is tired already is ridiculous			1
’ ’ you ca n’t just criticise him , the team as a whole have n’t been playing well			0
‘ @entity2 is the best in the @entity8 in that deep - lying role and it ’s just a matter of the team getting confidence back			2
’ the former @entity1 and @entity42 winger is also confident his old club can recover from their slow start , but does n’t think @entity46 ’ side will be challenging for the title this season			1
@entity1 ’s second - placed finish last term saw the @entity3 push @entity51 to the final day , but after three defeats in five games so far , @entity0 believes a summer of changes will leave his old club battling for nothing more than a top four finish			1
@entity46 speaks with @entity2 during @entity1 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity10 last saturday @entity0 says he still wo n't rule out @entity1 winning the @entity8 title despite their bad start ‘ i make @entity62 favourites with @entity51 just behind them , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ that ’s not to say that @entity1 wo n’t get back to the form they were in last season , because they will			2
‘ it will just take time for the new players to get used to each other - there were a lot of changes of the summer , but i think @entity1 will still finish third or fourth			0
after losing £ 75million striker @entity74 to @entity75 , @entity46 looked to replenish his squad with seven new faces including former @entity51 forward @entity78 , who sealed a £ 16m deal from @entity81			2
despite his bad - boy reputation , @entity0 is confident @entity78 can become a star of the @entity84 , as long as the @entity86 ‘ knuckles down ’			2
he added : ‘ i expect @entity78 to knuckle down and become a top player for the club			0
‘ i know that he ’s a great player and if there ’s a club where he can do right both on and off the field then it ’s @entity1			0
‘ @entity46 wo n’t be like @entity94 and try and fight him in training			2
he will be handled in the right way			0
@entity78 has arrived for £ 16m from @entity81 and @entity0 expects him to shine at @entity97 @entity46 will probably deal with @entity78 in a different way to how @entity94 did ... @entity0 ( right , with @entity99 and @entity100 ) was speaking at the unveiling of @entity31 ’s @entity30 lighting system speaking underneath the updated @entity31 arch , which will now see thousands of led lights react to moments such as goals scored , crowd noise and social media sentiment , @entity0 believes the new technology will help the atmosphere at the iconic stadium			1
‘ this new technology will make watching a football match become an even more interactive experience as the lights change when the crowd cheer			0
‘ i ca n’t so that i ’d have noticed such a thing as a player as i ’d be concentrating on scoring , but i ’m sure it will attract more fans to @entity31			0
’ the superfast 4g and fibre broadband provider , @entity30 , has installed the world 's fastest interactive led lighting system on the @entity31 arch. the stadium is on course to become the world ’s most connected stadium , thanks to the ground - breaking six year partnership deal with the telecommunications firm			0

@entity1 have lost three out of their first five @entity8 games
but legend @entity0 says @entity2 should not be criticised
many have said captain is too old to perform at the *highest* level
@entity0 also expects @entity78 to shine under @entity46
@entity62 and @entity51 are the favourites for the title
but @entity0 still wo n't rule out @entity1 despite their poor start
