by @entity1 reporter published : 11:43 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 19:57 est , 26 july 2012 @entity4 's men 's football team got off to a nervous start in their opening match against @entity7 , taking an early lead but allowing the @entity9 to draw level late in the second half			1
a packed @entity12 greeted the team with an enormous roar as they took to the field hoping to follow the example set by the women 's team who yesterday beat @entity20 1 - 0 in their opening match			1
it all started well as @entity24 @entity23 , who had been booed by sections of the crowd in the opening minutes , found the perfect way to silence his critics , by netting off a @entity30 cross			1
1 - 0 @entity31 : a delighted @entity23 celebrates after slotting in the opening goal for @entity4 @entity33 silences his critics netting from a @entity30 cross to put @entity4 ahead here we go : @entity30 leads out @entity31 for their opening match against @entity7 the first @entity4 @entity39 men 's football team since 1960 pose for their pre-match team photo @entity4 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity30 , @entity33 , @entity48 , @entity49			1

subs : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) but there was heartbreak after @entity7 drew level with less than ten minutes to go			2
it is @entity4 's first @entity39 men 's football match since 1960 , but it 's 100 years since they last lifted gold in this tournament			2
both captain @entity30 and @entity23 were criticised for failing to sing the @entity86 at the start of the match			1
@entity89 and his fellow @entity33 , @entity47 and @entity44 remained tight - lipped during the rendition of @entity91 at @entity12			1
@entity30 , turning out for his first major tournament at the ripe old age of 38 , was clearly fired up as he spoke to reporters before the match			2
he said : ' my bread and butter is playing for @entity99 in front of @entity99 fans at @entity12			2
this is going to be a bit different			0
' but it follows another embarrassing day for the @entity39 organisers after @entity106 player @entity47 was described as @entity107 in the official programme			1
the midfielder , who speaks fluent @entity106 and plays for @entity110 , is set to start for @entity4 this evening in their opening match with @entity7 at @entity12			1
@entity47 , 22 , is one of five @entity24 in the @entity31 squad but while the others - @entity30 , @entity23 , @entity44 and @entity55 - were correctly identified , @entity47 's entry read : ' nationality : @entity107			1
' a @entity118 spokeswoman said : ' there was an error in our programme and we inadvertently listed @entity47 as @entity107			1
' we apologise for this mistake and new programmes are now being printed with the correction in time for @entity31 's next match			0
' it follows a humiliating series of events last night at @entity130 in @entity131 when the @entity133 flag was shown next to the names of the @entity136 women 's football team			0
the squad walked off the field in protest and kick - off in their preliminary stage match with @entity142 was delayed by an hour			2
two young fans enjoy the atmosphere in @entity12 as they show their appreciation for @entity4 's first @entity39 men 's football team since 1960 a young @entity31 fan gets into the @entity39 spirit with her face painted up in patriotic red , white and blue @entity39 fever : fans enjoy the atmosphere inside @entity12 @entity4 's @entity47 tussles with @entity7 's @entity67			1
there was more embarrassment for the organisers after the @entity24 was described as @entity107 in the match programme young at heart : @entity31 captain @entity30 , 38 , battles with @entity68 of @entity7 early in the second half there was another gaffe yesterday when an official @entity164 ( @entity165 ) sent out an e-mail newsletter entitled ' @entity168 women on their way ' after @entity4 's 1 - 0 win over @entity20 at the @entity171 in @entity172			1
a free - kick on 65 minutes from @entity174 , an @entity168 international , ensured the perfect start to the @entity39 for @entity31 although predominantly @entity107 , the women 's squad also contains two @entity179 - @entity178 and @entity180			1
come on lads : four young fans show their true colours as they cheer on @entity31 the names of the @entity136 women 's football team appeared on the big screens at @entity130 next to the @entity133 flag @entity136 supporters in the stadium react with horror as the wrong flag is flashed up on the big screens @entity174 celebrates with her teammates after scoring the winning goal in @entity31 's 1 - 0 win over @entity20 in @entity172 last night			1
an official @entity197 e-mail newsletter wrongly said @entity168 had won the match and a further mistake came to light yesterday when @entity202 's foreign minister @entity201 wrote on @entity203 that @entity202 had been listed as a region of @entity205 in some official @entity118 athlete biographies			2
he tweeted : ' i have just ordered our embassy in the @entity210 to contact the @entity211 to correct the mistakes			0
' the word region is a clumsy mistake even from the point of view of @entity107 grammar			0
' a sell - out crowd is expected at @entity12 in @entity219 as @entity4 kick - off their @entity39 football campaign against @entity7 at 7.45pm			1
and there was an early upset this afternoon to whet the public 's appetite for @entity39 football when @entity226 beat favourites @entity228 1 - 0 at @entity130			1
@entity229 scored the winning goal in the first half , while @entity232 was sent off for @entity228			0
the @entity234 defenders can only look on as @entity226 's @entity229 scores the decisive goal at @entity130 @entity236 ( number seven ) celebrates scoring the winning goal with his teammates but there were reports of long queues outside @entity244 in @entity245 as spectators for the @entity247 vs @entity249 match were left waiting for up to two hours to collect their tickets			0
many who had bought tickets missed the kick - off as a box office staffed by just four or five officials was overwhelmed			0
it will be the first time a @entity210 team has competed in an @entity39 finals since 1960 but the side will only contain players from the @entity262 national teams			0
the @entity179 and @entity264 national associations declined to make players available because they feared for their integrity as individual football nations			2
coach @entity268 expressed his enthusiasm for the competition yesterday			0
the former @entity168 international said : ' we 've got a fantastic opportunity to sow a seed and say ' can this happen more often ? ' and say to the public this is a valid tournament			0
' it always boils down to me as a coach that the players go back to their clubs having had a fantastic experience and [ having ] been very proud to represent @entity4			2
' @entity31 manager @entity268 during a training session in @entity219 ahead of their opening fixture with @entity7 at @entity12 his captain , the @entity99 stalwart @entity30 , added : ' to be involved in a tournament at such a late stage of my career is one i 'm looking forward to			1
' all the lads have embraced it , we were fortunate to go to the village last week , you want to enjoy the @entity39 experience but the bottom line is you want to win football matches			0
' @entity4 also face the @entity300 and @entity301 in @entity302 with the top two sides qualifying for the quarter - finals			2
@entity30 fires in a cross during a @entity31 training session			2
the @entity99 veteran will captain the team tonight against @entity7 at @entity12 @entity30 is pictured here in friday 's warm - up friendly with @entity310 at the @entity311 in @entity312			1
he said he was looking forward to playing tournament football , having never qualified for one with @entity314 @entity31 may be relieved to get on with the action proper after a number of selection controversies in the run - up to the @entity39			0
@entity319 , widely expected to be included in the 18 - man squad as one of three permitted ' overage ' players , was controversially omitted			0
but the former @entity168 international , who had an active role in securing the @entity39 for @entity325 in 2005 , is still keeping busy			0
just hours after playing in a @entity326 all - star team against @entity327 in @entity328 , he was raising awareness of child malnutrition with prime minister @entity331 and @entity333 representatives at @entity334 in @entity325			0
much sought after : @entity319 flies back to @entity325 to urge prime minister @entity331 to help tackle malnutrition against young children all over the world last night , @entity338 was accused of turning his back on the @entity39 by putting club before country in another selection controversy			0
the @entity314 winger had declared himself unfit for the @entity344 but played and scored in a pre-season friendly for his club @entity346 in the @entity347 last night .			0

final score : @entity4 1 - @entity7 1
@entity12 packed for opening match
@entity24 @entity23 scores off a @entity30 cross to put @entity4 ahead
but agony late in the second half as @entity7 draw level
