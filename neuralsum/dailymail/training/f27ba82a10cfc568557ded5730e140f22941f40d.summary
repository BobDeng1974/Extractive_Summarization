an unemployed fitness fanatic who spends four hours a day working out says he claims benefits because he is ' too fit to work '			1
@entity3 , from @entity4 , who receives £ 72.50 per week in @entity5 , says he has stopped looking for a 9 - 5 job because the ' boring ' lifestyle would interfere with his strict regime			1
the 25 - year - old even believes the super-fit should receive extra government handouts for staying in shape so they can be ' free of everyday work '			1
mr @entity3 - who already gets half - price gym membership because he is unemployed - said : ' i 've had all sorts of jobs , from admin and customer service work , to kitchen and security placements			2
the problem was , all the positions were way too boring for me			0
' not only that , i was n't happy about paying taxes that go towards people who are sitting at home all day and making no contribution to society - especially overweight people who spend all their benefits on junk food and cigarettes			1
' i , on the other hand , am extremely dedicated to my fitness , and i simply do n't have time to waste spending all day doing a monotonous job , so in november last year i decided to give up work altogether			1
' i am now happy to say i 'm too busy staying fit , doing @entity57 and loving life to get a 9 - 5			1
' he added : ' i do n't see why someone of my fitness level and talent should be wasted in an office or shop			0
' mr @entity3 , who lives with his mother and 27 - year - old brother , currently claims £ 72.40 a week in @entity5			1
but he openly admits that he is making no effort to get a job , believing that fit people should not have to pay taxes that go towards treating overweight people on the @entity73			1
mr @entity3 , pictured with @entity74 , said his mother wants him to get a ' normal , boring job ' but that life is too short to ' conform to society ' he said : ' that 's part of the reason i refuse to get a 9 - 5 job - why should i have to sacrifice my own fitness levels to help pay for lazy people that sit on their backsides eating all day ? ' i know some people might say i should go and get a 9 - 5 job and stop claiming benefits , but i 'd bet most of those people cost just as much in @entity73 fees as i do on @entity5			1
' at the end of the day , i ca n't remember the last time i went to the doctors , and i live with my mum so i 'm not asking for housing either			2
' i 'm not saying all fat people choose to be that way , but in reality a large proportion of the people who claim benefits are totally wasting government money and have no ambition at all			0
' what i 'm doing with my life is far more of a testament to my country than pen pushing all day in some office job i do n't enjoy			1
' he added that the government should give him extra money for staying in shape			0
' the government should give free gym membership and fitness courses - but only to the super-fit , ' he said			2
' it should be totally free really - when you think the government spends £ 5bn a year on tackling obesity it 's absurd that fit people have to pay anything at all to stay in shape			1
' they should also work out a system that enables fit people to be free of everyday work if they are tied down in a boring job such as customer service or retail			1
' if they have a fitness - related job i believe they should be asked to keep working			0
' if more people were fit and healthy the government would save millions of pounds every year - even after paying out @entity5 and housing benefits			1
' the unemployed sportsman says he does have plans to make money in the future and is pursuing a career on the silver screen mr @entity3 , pictured centre with actress @entity145 and actor @entity146 , receives £ 72.50 per week in @entity5 mr @entity3 says that his mother @entity148 , who works in child care , wishes he would get ' a normal , boring job ' but that life is too short to ' conform to what society wants you to do '			1
he said : ' life is too short to do something you do n't enjoy - it 's not all about working - it 's more important to be fit and healthy and to look great as well			2
' when i look at myself in the mirror and see my body i feel great			0
' that is worth far more than going out and earning money just to conform to what society wants you to do			0
' he added : ' i am totally independent , driven , and self - sufficient , and i 'm fortunate enough to be receiving free @entity24 lessons from a top @entity168 master			2
' for me to go to work everyday and stop practising my art would be a total waste of talent			0
' mr @entity3 says he does intend to earn money one day and wants to make his name as a martial arts actor on the silver screen			0
he said : ' a lot of people call me @entity178 , because i can perform a lot of the moves he does and i 'm told i look like him too			0
' i 'd love to get a part in a @entity57 movie one day - that 's my ultimate goal			2
he added : ' you have to makes sacrifices if you want to make a real impact on the world , and for me that means training at least five times a week for 3 - 4 hours each session			0
' it can be physically tough , but at least i do n't have to put my energy into anything else so i can focus on it 100 per cent			0
' mr @entity3 has been learning @entity57 ever since he first developed an admiration for @entity197 as a young boy			2
he also trains with weights in the gym , something he has been doing since he was 18			0
he trains in @entity202 and now @entity57 .			0

@entity3 , 25 , from @entity4 , trains for four hours nearly every day

believes he costs state less than overweight people who use @entity73 services
says super-fit should get extra *payouts* so they are ' free of everyday work '
@entity57 fanatic says : ' i 'm too busy staying fit and loving life to get a 9 - 5 '
