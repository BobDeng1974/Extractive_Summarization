by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 02:41 est , 20 september 2012 suspicious : former chief of police in @entity3 sir @entity2 said @entity6 's ability to hide for five weeks ' worrying ' , especially as there was a £ 50,000 reward one of @entity9 's top police officers has condemned the ' worrying ' conspiracy by a minority in @entity12 who aided and protected suspected murderer @entity6 while he was on the run			1
sir @entity2 said the situation mirrored what he experienced in @entity3 , where he ran policing for seven years , whose communities had in the past protected terrorists and criminals			1
a culture of fear was used to stop people with information speaking to police , no matter how high the cash rewards for information were , the president of the @entity21 said			1
@entity6 , who was wanted in connection with two murders , was in hiding for five weeks in @entity12 before allegedly killing officers @entity31 and pc @entity33 yesterday			1
it is rumoured that he was seen drinking in pubs but this was not reported to police by people who allegedly witnessed it			2
and a £ 50,000 reward and dozens of armed raids across the city failed to uncover the wanted man			1
a candle and a pillow were found in a shed behind the @entity49 pub in @entity50 and he must have had help from people in the community to get food and drink as well as avoid detection , experts say			2
when asked what he thought about the @entity6 's ability to hide for that long without the police being told sir @entity2 said : ' of course it is worrying '			1
' if people are terrified of an individual then i can understand why people feel that they do n't want to step forward			0
it is something that i had to deal with day in day out in my time in @entity3 where fear was the key			1
' his views echo those of sir @entity99 , the chief constable of @entity100 , who said he was sure @entity6 was protected by a ' criminal conspiracy '			1
' we believe he has been protected by a criminal conspiracy to harbour him			0
we are determined to find the people behind that and bring those responsible to book , ' he said			0
police had offered a £ 50,000 reward for information about the murders of @entity111 , 46 , and his son @entity112 , 23 and huge posters of @entity6 , with his distinctive face and one eye , were plastered over the city to find him			1
statement : this graffiti on a brick wall in @entity120 , @entity3 , has the message : ' @entity122 / @entity123 ( @entity122 / @entity123 ) unwelcome out ' protest message : this mural painting in west @entity120 has the slogan : ' collusion ! it 's not an illusion ! ' the longer it took to track him down the more police ubecame convinced he was being aided by a criminal conspiracy and ' web of intimidation ' set up by criminals			1
the fugitive was held at @entity137 in june after returning on a flight from @entity139			0
but he was allowed home pending further inquiries			0
@entity6 had been questioned over the murder of @entity143 , who was gunned down in a @entity12 pub on may 25			2
by the time the police finally had him under lock and key on tuesday , he was suspected of three more – the two policewomen and @entity111 ’s father , @entity149 , in a gun and grenade attack in august 10			0
tragic : constable @entity152 was killed when an explosive device detonated under his car at in @entity155 but despite a large reward his killers have not been traced journalist @entity158 , the author of hoods , the story of the @entity162 - based organised crime family told the @entity163 ' it is a double - edged thing , ' he said			2
' people are not only fearful they also do n't trust the police with the information			0
they are not perceived to be part of the community			0
' similarly in @entity3 over the decades , large sums of money and great pressure from police have failed to convince people to tell the authorities about the whereabouts of offenders or who they believe committed crimes			2
more than 30 years ago @entity180 , then 29 , was shot dead by an @entity182 gunman as she chatted to someone on a doorstep			0
she was collecting census forms when she was ruthlessly killed as @entity186 believed the forms were being used by the @entity9 government to gather intelligence			0
a masked man dashed forward , snatched the clipboard she was holding and shot her dead , before stealing all the census documents			0
the murderer sustained cuts in the attack , wounds that would have been easily spotted by someone who knew him , but no one has ever been brought to book for the heartless killing			0
her husband even offered a reward of £ 20,000 of his own money but the murderer has never been found			2
police constable @entity152 was killed by a booby - trap car bomb planted outside his home in april near @entity155 by dissident republicans last year			0
a £ 50,000 reward has also failed to bring the murderers to justice			1
video : sir @entity2 defends the operation that led to two deaths sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1

sir @entity2 said fear was used to protect the man wanted for two murders , who allegedly killed two policewomen while on the run
@entity21 boss said same happened in @entity3 where fear was used as a tool to ensure *silence* in communities
it is alleged @entity6 was *sleeping* in a shed behind a pub and had a £ 50,000 reward for information hanging over him
@entity100 boss @entity99 has pledged to track down those who protected him for over a month
