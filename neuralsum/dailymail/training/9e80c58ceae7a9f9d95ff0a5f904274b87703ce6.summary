by @entity1 reporter published : 22:34 est , 18 august 2012 updated : 05:53 est , 21 august 2012 endurance athlete @entity2 launched another bid on saturday to set an open - water record by swimming 103 miles from @entity5 to the @entity6 without a protective shark cage			1
under a blazing afternoon sun at the @entity9 in the @entity11 capital , @entity2 adjusted her cap and goggles , pointed to the open water , blew a bugle and cried : ' adios amigos ! courage ! ' then she leaped in feet first and stroked out toward her supportboat			1
less than a week before she turns 63 - years - old , the @entity20 woman is attempting a feat that even the fittest of human beings would find daunting			2
it 's a dream that has taken three years of marathon open - water training swims and seen multiple aborted attempts at the crossing			2
last year , first a debilitating asthma attack and then painful , dangerous stings from box jellyfish forced her from the water on two separate attempts			0
this time @entity2 is banking on a custom - made swimsuit to protect her from the jellyfish			1
it covers her head - to - toe with a pantyhose face and holes only for the eyes , nose and mouth			2
it 's non-buoyant but still creates drag in the water , so she hopes to don it only at night when jellyfish are more likely to rise to the surface			2
' you have to learn from your mistakes			0
you do n't do it the first time , ' @entity2 said at a news conference , deeply tanned with goggle - rings around her eyes			1
' we need some luck , but we do feel like we 've solved all the problems			0
' @entity73 : supporters gather around @entity2 as she prepares for her 103 mile swim on her second try last summer to swim without a cage , her third total attempt , @entity2 lasted 41 hours before calling it quits			1
she estimated it will take at least 60 hours to complete the swim to the @entity6 , and said the @entity82 of @entity6 were forecast to remain calm in the coming days			1
go - time had been planned for sunday around dawn , but shifting weather forecasts prompted a last - minute change			2
the water north of @entity5 was slightly choppy on saturday , but expected to quiet down			2
' this is n't perfect			0
you can go out and see some little whitecaps , ' @entity2 said			2
' but i feel strong in the beginning , so why not get a few hours out and tonight it 's going to calm			2
' hoping : @entity2 last attempted the @entity11 - @entity6 swim in 2011 , she lasted 41 hours before calling it quits a member of @entity2 's team posted a message on her blog late saturday saying one of her shark divers received a painful jellyfish sting , but said nothing about the swimmer herself being stung			1
an online tracker hosted on @entity2 's website showed her charting an initial course west - northwest from @entity5 , presumably with the goal of entering into the @entity111 current at a favorable point			1
an on board navigator constantly checks conditions and re-calibrates her bearings every 15 minutes , @entity2 said earlier			2
' instead of staying on the couch for a lifetime ... be fiercely bold , and go out and chase your dreams ' in june , @entity121 endurance swimmer @entity120 made it 79 miles of the way before throwing in the towel in the face of strong currents			0
a fiercely driven competitor , @entity2 acknowledged it was hard to watch @entity120 come close to snatching away her long - held goal			1
' if she had succeeded i would have congratulated her , because i know how difficult it is , more than anybody			0
and after all , this is not my ocean , ' @entity2 said			2
' but it is my dream ... frankly - how can i lie ? - i 'm glad that i still have the chance to be first			0
' @entity2 first tried to cross the @entity82 in 1978 as a 28 - year - old , but fell short			1
live the dream : @entity2 , resting before beginning her arduous swim , says she has to chase her dream for that attempt @entity2 swam inside a steel cage , which she said not only protects from sharks and softens the waves but even creates a current that propels a swimmer forward			1
on her third bid at a cageless swim , a 50 - person support team including navigators , weather gurus and a shark handler from @entity121 were accompanying @entity2 on five vessels			1
she planned to take short , periodic breaks for rest and nourishment			0
support : a 50 - person support team , including navigators , weather gurus and a shark handler , will accompany @entity2 on five vessels			1
she plans to take short , periodic breaks for rest and nourishment in lieu of a cage , a kayaker will paddle alongside dangling an apparatus in the water that creates an electrical field designed to repel sharks			0
a team of shark handlers will carefully scan the surrounding waters from the roof of her main support boat , ready to dive in and gently nudge away any predators that make it through the shield			1
@entity2 confessed to sleeping poorly the night before and to feeling nerves , in addition to confidence , as she set out : ' my heart is going to beat fast because this is history in front of me			1
' after falling short in the past she has vowed not to try again , but each time the siren call of the @entity82 proved too great			0
asked whether she would make another attempt if the weather , currents and marine life all cooperate but she is physically not up to the task , @entity2 did not categorically rule out a fourth try			1
but she suggested that even she has a limit			0
so long : @entity31 swimmer @entity2 sets out from the @entity196 in @entity5 on her way to @entity6 ' sitting here , i ca n't address that , ' @entity2 said			1
' i have to say , it 's too much			0
i 've asked too many people to put in too much			0
we know what we 're doing			0
this has to be it			0
it just has to be			0
' @entity2 set a world mark for open - water swimming without a wetsuit in 1979 by crossing 102 miles from the @entity211 to @entity6			1
a writer , journalist and motivational speaker , she said she hopes to inspire people of all ages to live active lives			0
' instead of staying on the couch for a lifetime and letting this precious time go by , why not be bold ? ' she said			0
' be fiercely bold , and go out and chase your dreams			0
