a hearing in the case is scheduled for friday in @entity12			0
the ex-student has sued under a pseudonym to protect his privacy			0
the university is demanding he identify himself publicly , despite arguments that doing so would expose not only him but the woman who says she was assaulted			0
the student says he had been in a longstanding relationship with the woman , and that they frequently engaged in sadomasochistic role playing that involved using a safe word if one or the other wanted to stop			1
lawsuit : a student expelled from @entity1 for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name , arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing , not sexual assault ( file ) the lawsuit comes as colleges across the country , and particularly in @entity40 , are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault			1
the @entity44 implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now - discredited @entity48 article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party			1
the sexual misconduct allegations at @entity54 stem from an october 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student 's dorm room on the @entity60 campus			1
at one point , according to the lawsuit , she pushed him away but did n't invoke her safe word			1
later that night , the two engaged in a second sex act , in which the male student asked her if she was interested , and she replied , ' i do n't know			1
' according to the lawsuit , the couple remained romantically involved for several months , but they broke up after she found that he had been cheating on her			2

a three - person panel cleared him of any wrongdoing , according to the suit			0

process : the lawsuit claims the woman only filed a complaint after the couple broke up and she had found out the man was cheating on her ( file ) the lawsuit says that the appeal was handled improperly			1
it seeks an order that would strike the violation from his student record , and $ 3 million in damages			0
the lawsuit claims that the expulsion was a result of gender bias , and also claims that it violated his right to engage in constitutionally protected sexual activity			2
' the only explanation for such a rash , unreasoned , and unsupported decision is mr. @entity93 's desire to help a complaining female when the system had found a respondent male not responsible			2
if @entity125 ( the pseudonym for the unidentified female student ) were not a female complaining of sexual assault , her testimony would not have been credited over @entity134 's given the evidence corroborating @entity134 's explanation of their bdsm relationship and the material concessions @entity125 made at the hearing , ' the student 's lawyers wrote in their complaint			1
a @entity1 spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit			2
the university , in court papers , wants to overturn a judge 's decision allowing the student to sue anonymously			0
the university 's lawyer writes that the male student should have no fear of embarrassment if the allegations are true , because the public is increasingly accepting of unusual sexual relationships			1
and he argues the risk of the woman 's identity being exposed is minimal compared to the public 's right to an open judicial proceeding			0
' even if ms. @entity125 is identified simply by the fact that mr. @entity134 is identified , there is nothing in the record to suggest ms. @entity125 will be subjected to retaliatory harm , ' assistant attorney general @entity161 wrote on behalf of the university .			0
