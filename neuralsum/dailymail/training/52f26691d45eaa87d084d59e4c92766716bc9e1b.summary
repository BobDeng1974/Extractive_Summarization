scene : it is believed @entity16 lost control of her car ( pictured ) during a thunderstorm before she hit a bee hive in @entity11 do @entity13 city , @entity7 tragic : the 23 - year - old woman died after she was stung in @entity11 do @entity13 in @entity7 beekeepers know that individual swarms not only have their own group ' personalities ' - some are more aggressive than others , for example - but also that they can behave differently depending on the weather			1
hot and humid conditions often make bees bad tempered , while mild and sunny weather tends to encourage calm behaviour			0
though @entity53 bees rarely attack people , the same is not true elsewhere			0
a hybrid strain of bee known for its aggressiveness have been spreading north from @entity58 since the seventies in the @entity63 , ' @entity61 ' honey bees , a hybrid strain known for its aggressiveness , have been spreading north from @entity58 since the @entity59			2
the africanised bee was the result of experimental breeding carried out in @entity7 in the @entity67			2
it was designed to produce a strain that was better adapted to the @entity70 than common @entity53 strains , such as the @entity73 honey bee , @entity72			2
unfortunately , combining the genes of @entity76 and @entity53 insects produced a bee that , while productive , could be extremely defensive and even aggressive			0
honey bees are considered to be potentially dangerous across much of the @entity70			0
the main reason bee attacks can be so serious is the way the stings encourage further assaults			1
when a honey bee stings , it drenches the site with chemicals called pheromones , which send a message to the other bees , encouraging them to sting the same spot			1
the stings will be concentrated in sensitive areas such as the nose and eyes			0
when a honey bee stings you , the barbed protuberance through which the poison is delivered rips away the last segment of the animal 's abdomen			1
this means that the bee dies of severe haemorrhaging within minutes .			0
