the deaf twins killed by euthanasia in @entity4 chose to die because they ' had nothing to live for ' after learning they would soon become blind , their brother revealed today			1
the 45 - year - olds , named yesterday as @entity7 and @entity8 , had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world			1
their brother , @entity11 , said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution			1
' that was for my brothers unbearable , ' said mr @entity8 , 46			1
' did not want to end up in an institution : deaf @entity4 twins @entity7 and @entity8 chose to die by euthanasia because they feared losing their independence after learning they would also soon go blind ' they lived together , did their own cooking and cleaning			1
you could eat off the floor			2
@entity27 would have made them completely dependent			2
' i sometimes think , if they had their wives and children , perhaps they would have had something to live for			2
' the twins , from the village of @entity36 , near the city of @entity38 , were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma and had other severe medical problems , their local doctor , @entity43			1
the pair , who both worked as cobblers and could communicate with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family , enlisted the support of mr @entity43 to be euthanised			1
but it took them almost two years to find a medical institution to carry out the procedure after they were turned by their local hospital			1
mr @entity8 told the @entity58 that the family had tried to talk them out of it , but were eventually persuaded by their arguments			1
relied on each other : the twins , pictured here on @entity4 television before they were named , had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world they died by lethal injection four weeks ago , dressed in new shoes and suits , with mr @entity8 and their parents , @entity73 and @entity74 , by their sides at @entity76 in @entity77			1
mr @entity8 said : ' @entity7 and @entity8 waved again at us			1
" up in the sky , " they said			2
" up in the sky , " we replied			2
and then it was over			2
' euthanasia is legal under @entity4 law if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are suffering unbearable pain , according to a doctor 's judgement			0
the @entity4 law differs from that of @entity93 , famous for its @entity95 clinic , where only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted			0
this means patients must play an active role in the administration of the drug that ends their lives			0
@entity76 : in @entity4 , some 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011 , about one per cent of all deaths in the country , according to official figures in @entity4 , some 1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011 , about one percent of all deaths in the country , according to official figures			0
but this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill. mr @entity43 , the doctor who presided over the euthanasia , told @entity118 television news that the twins had taken the decision in ' full conscience '			0
he said they were ' very happy ' and it had was a ' relief ' to see the end of their suffering			0
' they had a cup of coffee in the hall , it went well and a rich conversation , ' mr @entity43 said			0
more to come ? @entity4 's ruling socialists tabled a legal amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the euthanasia of children and @entity140 's sufferers ( picture posed by models ) ' then the separation from their parents and brother was very serene and beautiful			1
at the last there was a little wave of their hands and then they were gone			0
' @entity4 was the second country in the world after the @entity153 to legalise euthanasia in 2002 , but it currently applies only to people over the age of 18			1
other jurisdictions where it is permitted include @entity159 and the @entity161 state of @entity162			0
just days after the twins were killed , @entity4 's ruling socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow the euthanasia of children and @entity140 's sufferers			0
the draft legislation calls for ' the law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we can not alleviate			0
' the @entity95 building in @entity174 near @entity175 : under @entity93 law only ' assisted suicide ' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives the proposed changes are likely to be approved by other parties , although no date has yet been put forward for a parliamentary debate			0
a bid to tighten legal controls on assisted deaths in @entity93 and ban suicide tourism was recently rejected by the country 's parliament			0
experts say the suicide tourism industry 's clients come mainly from @entity196 , @entity197 , and @entity198 , but that numbers have been declining in recent years			2
