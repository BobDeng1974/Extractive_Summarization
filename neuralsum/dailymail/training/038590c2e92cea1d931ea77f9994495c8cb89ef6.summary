getting dressed can be a challenge for mothers and their toddlers who may rather wear mismatched shoes and a superhero costume than blue jeans and a t - shirt			1
@entity7 , a mother of two , fashion blogger , and actress based in @entity10 decided to let her three - year - old son @entity12 dress her for a change after picking out his outfit every day of his life			1
' i have picked out my son ’s outfits almost every day of his three years on this planet			1
i thought it would be fun to turn the tables and let him pick my outfits out for a few days , ' said summer in a blog post she wrote for @entity26 posted recently			2
' the first few items were great : my @entity38 tee , with a gray skirt , and tights			0
i think i ’ll put this in my rotation			0
fabulous choices , @entity44 , ' wrote @entity7 of the conversation with her son			2
when @entity12 told his mother to wear nude shoes along with black tights she was a little hesitant but took his advice anyway			1
when showing the outfit to her husband later that day she expected him to laugh but he did n't notice anything out of the ordinary			0
' i walked down the stairs to show off my outfit to my husband			0
i waited for a laugh , but he did n’t notice anything different , ' she wrote			0
on day two @entity7 said that @entity12 chose her favorite outfit so far which consisted of a @entity62 t - shirt , polka - dot leggings , and gold pointy shoes which she says she would n't have thought to wear			1
rock n ' roll chic : @entity7 enjoyed most of her son @entity12 's rocker outfit but was less enthused about the nude heels she normally would n't pair with black tights ' these polka dotted @entity72 leggings look great with my @entity62 t - shirt			1
and although i would n’t have worn it with these shoes , it does have a fun feel to it			0
it ’s almost like homage to @entity82 , ' she wrote			0
day three was a flower filled outfit that sent her son @entity12 through the roof with excitement			1
' i like flowers ' said @entity12 as he pointed to flowery socks and a petal patterned sundress			2
' they both have flowers , ' he said			0
he then enthusiastically paired the outfit with pink striped shoes and a green jacket			2
while @entity7 said she felt a little self - conscious walking around in her outfit that day one woman actually complimented her			1
' @entity102 note : i was a little self - conscious running my errands that day ; but again , to my surprise i did n’t get one double - take or stare of curiosity			0
instead , i got a woman who stopped me to tell me she liked my socks ! ' she wrote			0
@entity110 's favorite : @entity7 said that @entity12 chose her favorite outfit on day two which consisted of a @entity62 t - shirt , polka - dot leggings , and gold pointy shoes day four proved to be a bit of a challenge for mother and son when @entity12 chose three shirts but no bottoms to go along with it			1
' @entity110 ca n’t go outside without any pants on , ' said @entity7			2
' how about we switch one of these shirts for a pair of pants ? , ' she added			2
@entity12 understood and chose the closest pair of pants along with two different types of leopard print shoes			1
on day five , @entity12 chose his mother another pair of mismatching shoes , this time two boots : one blue and one brown			1
@entity12 chose a shirt with arrows on it for his mother and desperately searched for pants with arrows on it as well but later settled for a pair of jeans			1
' i guess you have to look for some pants that have arrows on them , ' he told his mother with a stern face			2
tired and exhausted from choosing his mother 's clothes , @entity12 was pleased it was the last day of outfit picking			1
' his busy toddler schedule is packed with a lot of fun things and picking out my outfit every day was starting to take too much out of his day			0
when it came down to it , he ’d rather be painting or riding his bike , ' wrote @entity162			0
@entity7 said that the experience taught her that role reversal with children can be therapeutic			0
she also said it taught her to take more risks with her wardrobe , though she may not start wearing no pants and mismatched shoes anytime in the near future			1

@entity7 , a mother of two from @entity10 decided to let her three - year - old son @entity12 dress her for five days
her favorite outfit her son chose for her was a @entity62 t - shirt paired with polka - dot leggings , and pointed gold flats
some *problems* with the outfits @entity12 chose are when he picked out mismatched shoes and one outfit with three shirts and no pants
