there were a lot of potential managers in the @entity4 team that @entity5 captained but he , more than anybody , looked destined to be a top boss			1
his star quality was obvious from the start			2
if @entity11 do end up sacking @entity12 then there is already one man at the club who would happily take over , if asked			1
@entity5 wants to be a manager			1
he is intelligent , well - balanced and has a burning desire to win			0
he was a ferocious competitor on the pitch but off it he is a class act			0
@entity5 could be next in line to replace @entity12 at the @entity22 city manager @entity12 faces a nervous wait to see if he keeps his job this summer ( @entity25 ) @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 look dejected during the 4 - 2 @entity30 derby defeat he will feel slightly uncomfortable being linked to the top job			1
not because he does n’t want it but because @entity12 is still in charge			1
@entity5 has always been respectful			1
i met him for a tour of @entity11 ’s new training ground recently and the respect he commands at that club is incredible			1
he has an aura about him — when he enters a room , people pay attention			0
at @entity4 , @entity43 was a very visual captain on the pitch but behind the scenes @entity5 always had plenty to say			1
@entity48 columnist @entity47 ( right ) recently met his former team - mate at @entity11 's new training ground @entity5 was a captain who led by example during the pair 's time together at @entity52 the @entity53 winning @entity54 finished his playing career at @entity11 @entity48 's verdict on the @entity30 derby between @entity58 and @entity11 when he took over as captain he would hold team meetings without @entity61 and was never afraid to speak his mind			1
he is not afraid to take on big personalities — that ’s because personalities do n’t come much bigger than @entity5 ’s			1
he did not shout and scream — he was always calm and spoke with real authority			0
he never wanted to make rash decisions and is such a solid , reliable character			0
that ’s why he will make a fantastic manager one day			0
from the first day i met him at @entity4 , @entity5 has remained respectful and likeable			1
he is a model professional but he has the personality and presence to take charge in a dressing - room full of big egos			0
that ’s exactly what @entity11 need			2
he has worked with some of the best managers in the business — @entity61 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
there ’s no doubt he will have been studying those men to see how they operate so he can absorb their wisdom and use it to his advantage			0
but @entity5 wo n’t just try to emulate them , he is very much his own man			2
@entity5 has learned from top managers including @entity86 , @entity84 and @entity61 ( above ) @entity95 stepped up from coaching @entity97 reserves to become the youngest manager to win the @entity99 city did well to identify his talents and get him involved with the youth set - up			1
but he has not been killing time with the @entity104			0
everything he does is with an eye on one day becoming a manager			0
moving from the youth team to a senior side expected to win the title is a big step but @entity95 made the same leap at @entity97			0
it would be a huge challenge and one that @entity5 would relish			2
it may be that he has to go elsewhere to perfect his craft before returning to @entity11			2
either way , @entity5 has all the tools needed to succeed in the hot seat .			2

@entity12 's position has come under *scrutiny* at @entity11
@entity5 is in charge of the champion 's @entity126
the former @entity4 star is well *equipped* to become a top manager
