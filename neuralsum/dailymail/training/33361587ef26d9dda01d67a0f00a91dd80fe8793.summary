by @entity0 it may not be a full - on invasion of killer sea monsters , but it 's a start			0
a rambler stood and watched as this dustbin - lid - shaped , 4ft long barrel jellyfish swam half a mile up a river estuary			1
it is the latest sighting on the south coast of the huge but harmless creatures , which are usually found further out to sea and rarely come close to the shore			1
swimming upstream : this barrel jellyfish was spotted swimming up the @entity14 estuary in @entity15 stuff of nightmares ? thankfully the creature does n't rank with @entity19 as the tide would have washed it back out and the coming summer weather means there could be many more on the way , according to experts			1
measuring 4ft from head to tentacle tip , the harmless jellyfish are often spotted away from the southern and western shores of the @entity30			1
wildlife cruise operators have already reported hundreds of the creatures off the coasts of @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity15			1
but rambler @entity36 , 45 , photographed this jellyfish in a rare inland sighting as he visited @entity41 beach near @entity42			2
he said : ' it looked at first like a giant blancmange sitting on the water			0
i took a closer look and realised it was one of those rare jellyfishes that are making the news			0
@entity51 : the area of the @entity14 estuary in @entity15 where the jellyfish was seen ' invasion ' : a string of barrel jellyfish sightings has been reported on a beach in @entity59 , @entity35			1
above , wildlife photographer @entity60 poses with the enormous creature , measuring 3ft in diameter they look like something from a horror film , but barrel jellyfish are the ' basking shark ' of their species - enormous but harmless , feeding only on miniscule prey			1
often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the @entity72 , the @entity73 and off the @entity74			1
but it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland , which is why recent sightings have made headlines			0
and when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate , creating huge swarms			2
beneath the dustbin lid - shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ( ' pores ' ) , each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton			1
the stings , however , are not strong enough to harm humans			2
source : @entity95 ' i followed it about half a mile up the river before it eventually disappeared beneath the water			1
the thing moved at a snail ’s pace so i was able to get a few photos before it vanished			0
' @entity106 of the @entity95 said : ' half a mile up an estuary is not too far as they are relatively strong swimmers , but it was more likely carried in then out again by the tide			1
' this type of jellyfish is a regular visitor to the @entity113 , although we ’ve had reports of some very big ones this year			2
' this is the only species of jellyfish that can live for more than one season , so these larger jellyfish are probably adults who have survived through the mild winter			2
' the sighting comes days after several of the jellyfish washed up on beaches near @entity59 , @entity35			2
wildlife photographer @entity60 , who picked up one of the animals , said : ' i think we will see more strandings because of the on - shore winds and the tides , but people should be careful not to touch them			0
' the barrel jellyfish , latin name rhizostoma pulmo , is not thought to be dangerous to humans			1
even so , beachgoers are advised not to touch any jellyfish in case they chance upon a species with a powerful sting			0
@entity143 guidance says sting victims should not use urine to relieve the pain of a sting - because vinegar is far more effective			0
large : the sighting came days after this barrel jellyfish washed up on a beach in @entity59 , @entity35 working out where jellyfish will swarm is a tricky business , but tourists will soon have a helping hand - from the force , no less			0
marine biologists have launched a website called @entity159 ( @entity160 ) which maps swarms of the creatures and allows tourists to check their location			0
in future , it could have a weather forecast - like feature to help people avoid getting stung			0
the site draws on almost half a million sets of data on how many jellyfish there are in the uppermost 200 metres of the world ’s seas			1
it was created amid warnings that large numbers of the creatures can cause fish stocks to plummet			0
the scientists found the greatest concentrations of jellyfish were in the mid latitudes of the @entity187 , partly due to high levels of oxygen in the @entity190			2
dr @entity191 , a marine biologist from the @entity192 in @entity193 , said : ' people will be able to contribute their own data ... it will be like a jellyfish version of @entity198			0
' we have n’t got a weather forecast feature yet as it ’s just raw data but in the future we ’re hoping to have something to help members of the public use the database			0

creature spotted swimming half a mile up @entity14 river estuary in @entity15
the huge jellyfish are usually found further out in the @entity72
they even have hundreds of tiny mouths ( but are harmless to humans )
