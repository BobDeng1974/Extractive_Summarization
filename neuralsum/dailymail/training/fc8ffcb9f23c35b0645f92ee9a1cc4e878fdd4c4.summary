manager @entity0 admits @entity1 must stop @entity2 to avenge last month 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity4 at the @entity5 on saturday			1
@entity2 has been a thorn in @entity1 's side in the past two seasons , making both goals for @entity10 in a 2 - 0 home victory last term and then scoring twice at @entity13 in december as @entity4 overturned an early @entity15 strike to run out comfortable winners			1
@entity0 believes @entity2 is the strongest forward in the @entity17 and admits much of @entity1 's game plan this week has been based on keeping the 6ft 4in target man quiet			1
@entity2 ( second left ) heads in against @entity1 as @entity4 won 3 - 1 in december @entity2 's fitness this season has been a huge factor in @entity4 's impressive form so far @entity0 feels his @entity1 team need to combat the threat of @entity2 if they are to beat @entity4 ' it 's something we have to put right but he is an incredible player physically , ' @entity0 said about the 26 - year - old @entity28			1
' he is probably the most powerful forward in the @entity17 and he has supremacy over everyone			0
' sometimes when the ball in is right , there 's not much you can do , but we have to try to stop him and that 's something we 've been working on			2
' we want to put in a performance so we can put our performance down there earlier in the season behind us			0
' we just felt disappointed at @entity4 because we did n't reach our usual performance level and we do n't want to make the same mistake again			2
' we did n't give a good account of ourselves and we did n't use our strengths well enough in the game and , hopefully , we can do that better this time			0
' @entity1 would go level on points with seventh - placed @entity4 if they beat @entity47 's side but the build - up to the game has been dominated by the potential loss of top marksman @entity15 to @entity51			1
@entity1 players applaud their supporters after a 1 - 1 draw against @entity55 @entity56 ( second right ) could be leaving @entity1 to join @entity17 champions @entity51 @entity15 , who is unavailable on saturday anyway as he is away with his national team ahead of the @entity59 , is in talks over a Â£ 30million move to the @entity17 champions and @entity64 forward @entity63 is set to deputise in his absence			1
@entity63 has also been linked with a move away from @entity1 this week with several @entity17 rivals reported to be interested in his services , but @entity0 insists his squad have been fully focused on the challenge ahead rather than being distracted by off - field matters			1
' i can assure you the players are focused on @entity4 - fully focused , ' @entity0 said			1
' we were always going to be without @entity15 in this period anyway and the players knew that			0
we had already planned for that			0
' we will be looking to put a performance on in front of our crowd and we want to do that not just because of our recent performance against @entity4 , but because we are in a good position and we want to try to push on in the second half of the season			2
' the intensity has gone up in training			0
i have told the players that i am going to push them harder now because the second half of the season is harder than the first			0
' everyone starts to realise what they are fighting for in the league so i think it becomes harder			0
' @entity97 might have lost out to @entity47 in east @entity98 last month but he is once again looking forward to pitting his tactical wits against a manager 25 years his senior and with vast managerial experience			1
striker @entity63 ( right ) has also been linked with a transfer to @entity104 from @entity1 ' all credit to him , @entity47 has shown his experience and is definitely one of the managers of the year , ' @entity0 said			1
' he has been open - minded and he has adapted and you have to give him massive credit for that			0
' it 's something i 've looked at and it 's something to bear in mind for me because he knows his stuff			0
' @entity4 have been fantastic this season			2
they have played some great football and they also have @entity2 , so they can play more direct if they want to			2
' but we have a chance to claw level with them if we get our performance right			0
