@entity1 manager @entity0 has promised the club will be ambitious if they decide to strengthen their squad this summer			1
the newly - crowned @entity5 champions must limit their spending to a net £ 49million as punishment for breaching @entity9 's financial fair play regulations			1
but @entity1 , who also won the @entity12 last season , have already insisted the @entity15 governing body 's sanctions will not have any ' material impact ' on their planned transfer activity ahead of next term			1
confident : @entity1 manager @entity0 does not believe @entity9 's financial fair play regulations will affect his side 's preparation or targets for next season @entity23 : city are keen on a summer move for @entity27 defender @entity26 so although any spending would have to total considerably less than last year 's £ 90million outlay , @entity0 is still hopeful of securing top targets			1
asked if changes were likely , the @entity31 told @entity33 : ' maybe			2
we are going to see which is the best way to improve			2
' i think one of the most important things for me is to have an ambitious mind			0
' it is very important to win the title but these two titles will not be useful the next year			0
' we must analyse all the good things we did , all the bad things , where we must improve , which is the best way to do it			0
we have a lot of work ( to do )			0
' @entity0 's remarks come after chairman @entity48 promised that any transfer activity this summer would be swift and decisive			1
one issue likely to be exercising the minds of officials at the @entity53 is the extraordinary comments of key midfielder @entity55 and his agent this week			1
@entity55 has indicated that he is unhappy at the club because he feels under - appreciated and disrespected			1
one of his chief complaints appears to be that he felt senior figures at the club failed to acknowledge his birthday during last week 's post-season trip to @entity63			2
not impressed : @entity55 ( right ) is unhappy that the club failed to acknowledge his 31st birthday @entity55 's stock is presently high after an outstanding 2013 - 14 season , in which he scored 24 goals in all competitions , including 20 in the league and a superb strike in the @entity12 final			1
@entity1 have not commented on the situation but with the player having signed a new four - year contract just 13 months ago , their position is one of strength			0
it also comes just over a week after @entity55 addressed the crowd gathered for @entity1 's open - top bus parade of @entity83 and spoke of his ambitions for the club next season			1
the @entity87 international , speaking on may 12 , a day before his 31st birthday , said : ' we are looking for ( more )			0
we have the team and we have the manager			0
' this ( next ) year is going to be tough , we know that , but with the team we have we can do it			0
we expect a lot , the fans expect a lot as well			0
we can do it again , we can win it			0
' @entity0 has similar aims			1
the former @entity99 boss enjoyed a superb first season in charge , winning two trophies and even sustaining a push for four into the second half of the campaign			2
repeat performance : @entity0 is aiming to retain the @entity5 title after winning it in his debut season asked about his targets for next year , @entity0 said : ' exactly the same as this season			1
' we are the team that played longer in all the competitions			0
for me the four competitions are important			0
' we must play in the @entity117 , and in the @entity5 and in the cups with our squad , with rotation , because you can not play with players every game and you can not prioritise one competition			2
' @entity0 now intends to enjoy a summer holiday but admits it will be hard to detach himself from his preparations for next season			1
the 60 - year - old said : ' when you win the title it is very easy to enjoy the holiday , ( but ) also it is very difficult to disconnect absolutely , you can not do it			0
" i hope we can prepare ( for ) the next season with ( director of football ) @entity137 , with the owner and the president in the same way we did this year			2

@entity0 is weighing up how to strengthen his squad for next season
city must limit their spending to a net £ 49million to meet @entity9 regulations
@entity55 's future is in doubt after the midfielder complained about being disrespected
