it has three decks , tilting @entity3 - style jets and breaks itself up into pieces during a crash landing - and could be the future of air travel			2
called @entity9 , the concept aeroplane it set to be bigger than an @entity11 , look like a spacecraft and have ' self - healing ' wings that repair themselves			1
the aircraft would split passengers into three classes , each with their own deck , in a modern - day version of the @entity22 ’s strict division of passengers			1
called @entity9 , the concept plane , pictured , is set to be bigger than an @entity11 , look like a spacecraft and have ' self - healing ' wings			1
the engines would tilt 45 degrees meaning the plane could land on runways anywhere in the world			0
it was created by @entity33 designer @entity32 capacity : 755 passengers @entity36 : 88m length : 77m decks : 3 classes : tourist class with sky views , business class and first class other features : self - healing wings , engines that tilt 45 - degrees making it possible to take off on the spot , double fuselage and virtual reality windows			1
every passenger would additionally have virtual reality windows to keep themselves entertained on long flights			1
the @entity53 was created by @entity33 designer @entity55 and is so big it was described by @entity56 as looking ' more like something thought up for the @entity59 movie franchise than a legitimate aircraft '			0
the tilting engines would make it possible for the @entity9 to take off on the spot - and , according to the plans , if it crashes the passenger section would separate from the wings to reduce the loss of life			2
the craft matches advances in technology with a huge capacity of 755 passengers , making it economically viable for an airline			1
the plane would seat 755 passengers , making it economically viable for an airline , such as @entity77 , pictured in this concept illustration			1
passengers would be divided into three classes : ' tourist class ' , the equivalent of economy , ' tourist class with sky views ' , or business class , and ' first class ' the @entity9 , pictured , would be built out of advanced new materials made up of ceramic or fibre composites			2
it would also have advanced ' active wings ' powered by a hybrid turbo - electric propulsion system making them much more efficient than today the @entity9 would have a wingspan of 88m compared to 80m for an @entity11 and 64m for a @entity94			1
the three classes would be ‘ tourist class ’ , the equivalent of economy , ‘ tourist class with sky views ’ , or business class , and finally ‘ first class ’ , which would also have sky views and ‘ all conceivable luxuries ’			2
it is not clear how passengers would be able to look at the view , though given the size of the craft it is likely to have larger windows than those fitted to the back of current plane seat ones			1
those in economy would not be without , though - their windows would be fitted with virtual reality screens so passengers could see whatever they want			1
according to @entity121 ' concept plans , the giant aircraft would be powered by three harrier - style jets and feature a double fuselage , meaning it could go longer without refuelling			2
there would also be micro solar cells on the wings that could draw power from the sun the @entity9 , pictured top , would have a wingspan of 88m compared to 80m for an @entity11 , pictured bottom , and 64m for a @entity94 747 , pictured in the centre the @entity9 would also be longer than current commercial aircraft at 77m			2
by comparison , the @entity11 is 67.9m long while the @entity94 is 76m long , pictured @entity55 , who is based in @entity137 , said the @entity9 would be built out of advanced new materials made up of ceramic or fibre composites			0
it would have advanced ' active wings ' powered by a hybrid turbo - electric propulsion system making them much more efficient than today			0
the @entity9 would have a double fuselage meaning it could go longer without refuelling and would have micro solar cells on the wings so that it could draw power from the sun. according to @entity55 , the engines could tilt to up to 45 degrees meaning they could land on tiny runways anywhere in the world			0
they would be controlled by a fly - by wire system that is assisted with active sensors located through the plane ’s surface			0
in addition to being able to land on small runways , the tilting engines would also make it possible for the plane to take off on the spot			0
these engines would be controlled by a fly - by wire system assisted with active sensors located through the plane 's surface if the @entity9 has to make a crash landing , the passenger section would separate from the wings to reduce the loss of life			0
the effect of all the technology is to reduce drag , fuel consumption and weight , making it one of the greenest aircrafts imaginable writing about the way the plane could break up , @entity177 said : ‘ the disposition of the wings and its architecture separates from the airplane ’s fuselage like a security measure , that in a hypothetical fatal case of an emergency landing , these could auto - break up to reduce the damages on the passengers section			1
' the effect of all the technology is to reduce drag , fuel consumption and weight , making it one of the greenest aircraft imaginable			0
in his proposal @entity55 said the @entity9 ' is a concept about the future ‘ green ’ aircraft designs for the regular airline ’s planes of the 21st century … ‘ ... is a mixture between today ’s airplanes and future concepts based in blended wing body or hybrid wing body architecture			0
’ designer @entity121 has not announced any plans to build the concept aircraft , pictured in his proposal @entity32 said the @entity9 ' is a concept about the future ' green ' aircraft designs for the regular airline 's planes of the 21st century			0
[ it ] is a mixture between today 's airplanes and future concepts based in blended wing body or hybrid wing body architecture '			0

concept *vehicle* would have wingspan of 88m and seat 755 passengers
@entity177 said it would split passengers into three classes
each would have their own deck in a modern - day version of the @entity22
everyone on board would have virtual reality windows for entertainment
