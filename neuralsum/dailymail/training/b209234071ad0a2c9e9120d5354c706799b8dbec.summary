the mega-fight for which the world has been waiting what seems like an eternity may finally happen not just once , but twice			2
@entity4 versus @entity5 is tantalisingly close to becoming reality after the @entity4 ’s dazzling , rejuvenated performance here in @entity9			1
the target date is may and if @entity4 were to win the scene would be set for them to do it again next september			2
@entity4 ( right ) dazzled in @entity9 during his victory against @entity16 @entity15 @entity5 could demand a re-match with @entity4 should he lose the first proposed bout @entity5 is believed to be demanding a re-match clause in the contract if he succumbs to the mounting pressure to fight @entity4 and then loses			1
that was revealed by @entity4 ’s iconic trainer , @entity23 , as he reviewed the prospects for a @entity5 fight before flying back from @entity26 to @entity27			1
@entity23 told me : ‘ my understanding is that @entity5 is insisting on the re-match if @entity4 beats him , which i believe he will			1
that ’s okay with us			2
’ and why not , given the huge amount of money which would be involved ? the original projection of boxing ’s first $ 300 million fight will soar to one billion dollars if @entity4 ’s promoter @entity39 succeeds in opening up the vast @entity26 television market to pay - per - view			1
@entity4 's iconic trainer @entity23 ( left ) has reviewed the prospects of a re-match that would make for not just one but two billion dollar fights if his @entity4 beats @entity5 the @entity47 first time out			1
@entity4 put the heat back on @entity5 after decking @entity15 no fewer than six times on his way to victory by a record 18 points in the @entity53			1
that was compiled by his winning of all 12 rounds and the @entity16 having half a dozen points deducted for those knock - downs			0
job done , world welterweight title retained , @entity61 then called out @entity5 for the first time , saying : ‘ i want this fight and it is time now to give it to all our fans			1
they deserve to see it			0
’ one by one the several obstacles raised by @entity5 have been removed , including @entity4 agreeing to random blood tests for drugs and accepting a 60 - 40 financial split in favour of his rival for the mythical title of greatest pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
@entity4 dominated his fight with @entity15 from the first bell and won convincingly in @entity9 @entity39 , having said that the fight needs to happen if boxing wants to be regarded as a major sport , adds : ‘ enough is enough			1
all it needs now is for them to make the call			0
me and @entity89 are waiting to pick up the phone			0
’ @entity39 is working also on the rivalry between the two major @entity16 cable television networks , @entity92 who screen @entity4 ’s fights and @entity95 who have two fights left on their mega-bucks contract with @entity5			1
he is reported to be in talks with @entity100 , @entity95 ’s parent company , about them sharing the pay - per - view broadcast in @entity16 with @entity92 , the way they did with @entity103 versus @entity104			0
that puts the ball in @entity5 ’s court			2
promoter @entity39 ( left ) has been accused of blocking a potential fight between @entity4 and @entity5 as @entity23 says : ‘ @entity5 is afraid of losing his unbeaten record to @entity4			1
but that ’s not what defines greatness			0
@entity113 lost , @entity114 , lost @entity115 lost …			0
but they ’re still all - time greats			0
what counts is fighting the best of your era			0
it would have been preferable for these two to meet five or six years ago , in their prime , but although @entity5 is 37 and @entity4 coming up 36 next month , there is still time for the fight , or fights , to be meaningful			1
both men live clean , eat healthy and adhere to rigorous training regimes			0
given the remarkable physical conditioning made possible by those disciplines , they are still the greatest fighters of their age			0
let ’s get it on			0
undefeated @entity5 ( left ) defeated @entity135 in @entity136 back in september @entity4 shows his softer side after @entity139 demolition @entity4 will dip into his £ 20million - plus purse for turning @entity15 into a human yo - yo to fund the education of three hundred under - privileged kids in the poor district of the @entity145 which he represents as a congressman			1
he is paying the school fees as well providing the computers and other equipment			0
@entity5 has used a portion of the $ 40 million he received for september ’s repeat victory over @entity135 for his latest glitzy extravagance , the purchase of a gold - plated @entity155 golf buggy for his son ’s birthday			2
they are both great fighters but there is one thing @entity161 ca n’t buy			0
@entity4 will fund the education of under - privileged kids in the @entity145 with his @entity139 winnings @entity164 delighted with performance @entity166 set for a final fling in @entity136 ? @entity166 ’s hopes of ending a stellar ring career with his first fight in the glamorous boxing @entity172 of @entity136 are still alive			1
negotiations for him to defend his world super-middleweight titles there against @entity176 seemed to have stalled on a contract dispute between the son of the @entity180 legend and his promoter @entity39			0
however , before flying back to @entity136 from his successful staging of @entity4 ’s latest victory in @entity9 , @entity39 said : ‘ although @entity185 wants to move on , we have one fight left on our contract with him			1
@entity166 ( pictured ) could be set for a final fight against @entity190 ‘ now he tells us he wants the fight with @entity166 so if he bites the bullet with us it will happen			2
’ the delay is expected to push the proposed date of january 31 back to late february or early march			0
by then the @entity195 may strip him of their belt for failing to give fellow @entity198 @entity197 a mandatory defence , even though he has been an exemplary , high - profile champion for that body			0
but that would still leave his @entity203 title at stake and @entity166 will not be railroaded into another domestic scrap , the way he was for two successive mandatories against @entity208			2
@entity166 does n't want another domestic scrap following two successive mandatories against @entity208 @entity197 ( right ) must wait for @entity166 to decide if he will grant him a shot at his world title			2
