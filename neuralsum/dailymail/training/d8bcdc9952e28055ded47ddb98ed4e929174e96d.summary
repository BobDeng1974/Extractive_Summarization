a sister of one of the men told a local radio station that the two men were only freed on saturday after their families agreed to pay the ransom			1
she added that , if the money had not been paid , then the two teenagers would be dead			2
the ants used , known as plant - inhabiting ants , live inside trees , helping them grow by clearing other plants away that might compete with them for food or light			2
they are not generally aggressive and will only sting when attacked , usually when somebody accidentally steps on their nest or into their territory			0

their venom is an anti-inflammatory , and in small doses can be used as a traditional cure for arthritis , but in large doses can be extremely poisonous , causing kidney and liver failure .			0
