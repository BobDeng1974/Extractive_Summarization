but in the midst of the panic as @entity4 and his class bolted to the corner of the classroom , he found a ball point pen and etched , ' @entity30 , i love you all so much ' - underlining the ' so much ' - and underneath drew a cross with the words ' i am here now ' to symbolize the afterlife			2
speaking to @entity41 , @entity4 said that he truly believed that if the shooter , who was unknown to him at the time , had entered the class room , he thought he was going to die and wanted his family to know he was in a better place			1
