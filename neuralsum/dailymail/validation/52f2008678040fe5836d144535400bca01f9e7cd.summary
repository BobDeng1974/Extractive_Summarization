maybe take your kids into the bush and show them how to hunt			0
but if you ’re in a welfare cycle it ’s very hard to break from it			0
‘ but if these people are being displaced again from land it would just be destroying them			0
what other option do they have ? @entity52 believed that being ' spiritually connected to the land you live on is not a lifestyle choice ' assistant minister for health , @entity56 , listens on as @entity6 reacts to mr @entity5 's comments on @entity27 's q&a programme ‘ do they go into town and get into trouble and become a burden there to the police force and everyone else ? or are they allowed to stay on the country where their spirit is happiest ? ’ assistant minister for health , @entity56 , was also appearing on the programme			1
she was asked if what the prime minister had said was a hard phrase to defend , to which she replied : ' it 's probably not a phrase i would have used			2
