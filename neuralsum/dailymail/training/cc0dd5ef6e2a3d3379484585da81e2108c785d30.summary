@entity0 : @entity1 is the most underrated player in the @entity2 ... @entity4 fans should thank him and move on @entity0 : is @entity5 the new @entity6 ? @entity7 will suffer if they keep it tight with @entity9 ... he must be brave , as he promised @entity0 : @entity7 must be adventurous and take the @entity10 by storm or go out in glory ... my starting xi for the opener with @entity9 playing football on the light , golden sand of the @entity17 in 30 degrees of burning sunshine is a good , good feeling			1
and as i made my way off the beach back to my apartment , the reality of what is about to start sunk in			0
a sweaty drive through the heavy traffic takes you to the @entity28 , where the @entity10 final will be staged next month			2
this is where legends and heroes will be created in the next few weeks			0
it ’s not just the final that makes the player ’s name , although that is the ultimate moment to do be either hero – ask sir @entity40 ; villain – @entity42 knows that feeling ; or both – ladies and gentlemen , i give you @entity46 , the only man to win and lose different @entity10 finals single - handedly			1
club success is brilliant , but when it comes to being remembered , it ’s history made on a micro level			0
biggest stage : @entity53 and @entity54 in training for @entity7 ... and this could be their last chance to shine next step : can they elevate themselves from great club players , to true star status ? to hit the globe hard enough to stay in people ’s consciousness you have to do it at the @entity10			1
nowhere else can give you that level of legendary status			0
what do most people think of when they hear the name @entity75 ? @entity76 of course			2
@entity80 ? that tackle on @entity82 in 1970			2
@entity83 ? that save from @entity82 in 1970			2
@entity85 ? the best celebration ever			0
@entity87 ? that phenomenal goal in 1998 in @entity89			0
the list goes on and on			0
world famous : @entity7 winning the @entity10 in 1966 , @entity40 and the @entity7 ' defining moment hero and villain : @entity46 scored twice in the 1998 final , but was sent off for a headbutt in 2006 in against @entity9 it ’s all about the @entity10			1
@entity99 fans will remember @entity101 ’s 31 goals for them this season , but the rest of the world knows @entity101 as the villain against @entity106 in @entity107 in 2010			1
@entity109 ’s most memorable feat is scoring the winning goal in a @entity10 final , not being part of the great @entity114 team that included @entity115 and @entity116			2
so all 736 players converging on @entity118 this week for the @entity10 know that this is the chance to make an indelible mark on football history			1
aside : @entity101 ( front ) scored 31 goals for @entity99 last season ... but most will remember him for something else cheat ? @entity127 in 2010 prevented a goal , before @entity106 missed the resulting penalty and that includes the @entity7 squad			1
this is the moment where they can do something that means they will be remembered forever			0
for @entity53 and @entity54 , it ’s a last chance probably			1
can any of them take it ? can they elevate themselves from great club players , to true star status at a @entity10 ? can they create history and earn themselves a chapter in the book of @entity10 history ? will they seize the moment to earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as @entity82 ? there are some fans , especially in @entity7 , who will tell you international football is dying			1
a true test : @entity78 performed on the biggest stage , not just at club level the biggest stage : @entity75 's ' @entity76 ' against @entity7 in the 1986 @entity10 despite @entity163 ’s spectacularly terrible way of running the game , the @entity10 remains the biggest sporting event on the planet , bigger even than the @entity167			1
whether @entity7 are good or bad , when they get to a tournament they are always bigger than any club side around			0
@entity118 is a place for legends – let ’s see if @entity5 and these @entity7 players can make themselves true legends , not just club legends			0
@entity5 's @entity7 : @entity118 is a place for legends - let 's see if @entity5 's men can make their own history			0

can @entity53 and @entity54 step up on what could be their last chance on the biggest stage ?
the @entity10 is far beyond any other footballing *platform*
ask @entity78 , @entity75 , @entity46 , @entity82 , @entity188
@entity101 will be remembered by @entity99 fans for his goals , but by fans across the world for his *handball* against @entity106 in 2010
