by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 12 april 2013 after years of @entity4 and @entity5 owners getting turned away for replacements because their devices indicated water damage , and thus a voided warranty , @entity1 has agreed to pay out $ 53 million in a class action suit			1
settled : @entity1 has agreed to pay $ 53 million in class action suit that said it unfairly denied customers replacement devices the settlement could affect hundreds of thousands of customers who brought their malfunctioning devices to @entity1 , only to be told they were no longer covered by warranties because a little sticker inside had turned a shade of pink or red			1
no matter the problem , the company refused to replace any device with a pink or red sticker and must now pay what amounts to about $ 200 per claimant in the suit			1
only owners of original , @entity34 , and @entity33 as well as first , second , and third generations of the @entity36 are affected by the settlement			0
so , who ’s to blame ? not us , says @entity1			2
signed wednesday , the tech giant admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement			1
the company that makes the ‘ @entity44 , ’ meanwhile , said their product may have been the culprit in so many voided warranties			0
though @entity1 owns the patent to the strips , maker @entity49 indicated that humidity and not water contact could have turned some of the white stickers pink , misleading customer service representatives who examined the devices			1
@entity1 , nonetheless , may have learned of the issue years ago			0
denied : for years , @entity1 routinely voided warranties to customers whose devices indicated water damage according to a report in the @entity65 , the company ‘ quietly tweaked ’ its water damage policy in 2011 to be a little more giving			2
the policy now indicates that devices with an activated @entity70 may still be replaced ‘ if a customer disputes ’ that water made contact with the device as long as there are no signs of corrosion			0
however , the policy stopped short of faulting the indicator strips , which the policy says ‘ are designed not to be activated by temperature or humidity that are within the product 's operating requirements			0
’ that means newer devices were not covered in the suit , payouts for which could go up or down depending on number of claims submitted			0
blame : @entity1 claimed no wrongdoing in the suit while makers of the ' @entity96 ' strips admitted they may have been misleading			2

hundreds of thousands could get $ 200 settlement after owners under warranty were denied servicing from the tech giant *due* to faulty ' *liquid* contact indicators '
the @entity49 company , but not @entity1 , admitted their *technology* may have been to blame in the case that *stretches* back to the *earliest* *iphones* and @entity5
