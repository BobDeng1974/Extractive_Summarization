by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:32 est , 17 february 2014 a pair of twins who live parallel lives , even working the same job , have taken their double life to extremes - by giving birth on the same day			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , 35 , were already as close as can be after growing up together , choosing the same university and taking identical jobs as science technicians at a secondary school in @entity16 , @entity17			1
but , despite both women having discovered that they were pregnant on the same day , the uncanny sequences of events seemed to end when they were given different due dates			1
coincidence : @entity11 , left with baby @entity22 , is pictured alongside her sister @entity10 , with her daughter @entity24 , right the twins - who say they ' feel the same pains ' as each other - were taken to separate hospitals as the day drew nearer , with @entity10 set for a caesarian while @entity11 opted for a natural birth			1
however , just as @entity10 's daughter @entity33 was removed via c - section at @entity36 's @entity35 early on thursday morning last week , her sister 's contractions began at the @entity37 in @entity38			1
by the afternoon , she too had given birth to a child - a baby boy named @entity22			2
after the births , both were moved to @entity43 for post-natal care , and are in cubicles next to to one another			2
parallel families : @entity11 , left , smiles with her son @entity22 and husband @entity48 , next to @entity10 , baby @entity24 and her husband @entity50 , right peas in a pod : the sisters say they have always been close - and can even feel one another 's pain @entity11 , from @entity56 , near @entity38 in @entity57 , said : ' i honestly did n’t think that i would go into labour at the same time			1
my contractions started at 1.20am , the exact moment @entity24 was born by c - section , and i had @entity22 at 2.55pm that day			0
' @entity10 , who lives with her husband @entity50 in @entity17 , said : ' we do feel the same pains and if the other one is upset , we can feel it			2
' we are really close and have been ever since we were little but i ca n’t believe this			2
the staff at all the hospitals involved said they have never heard anything like it			0
' the siblings both work at @entity75 at @entity16 as science technicians and both studied at @entity78			0
same age : both @entity22 , left , and @entity24 , right , were born on thursday february 13 after being a double - pack of pregnancy tests in june , @entity10 discovered she was pregnant , and rushed to tell @entity11 and her husband @entity48			1
and , using the second kit from the back , @entity11 discovered the same day that she was pregnant			1
@entity48 said : ' to me it feels as though we ’ve had twins ourselves			0
not only have i got a son but i ’ve got a daughter as well			0
' the sisters ’ dad @entity91 , of @entity93 , @entity57 , was also delighted to hear he had become a grandfather twice in one day and that their mum @entity33 , who died four years ago , will be remembered by both of their middle names			0
@entity50 , who has known his brother - in - law since their school days , said : ' we would really like to thank the @entity105 staff at all three hospitals for their care			0
' midwife @entity109 , said : ' this is the first time i ’ve ever known this to happen			0
it ’s so rare and to have them both on the ward confused us greatly			0

@entity11 and @entity10 , 35 , say they have always been close
they twins both found out in june that they were pregnant
but they were given different due dates and taken to separate hospitals
in the end both gave birth last thursday within 13 hours of each other
they are now *recovering* together in @entity43
