golden questions : a crowd of strangers will make ' life - changing decisions ' for volunteers in a new @entity6 show sometimes they will quietly observe from a distance , but at other times they will be able to ask questions			1
close eye : the jury will follow the person who asks the question around for a week including at work the programme makes say the crowd will ' delve into people 's personal circumstances and uncover problems to inform a picture of their lives and how to improve it			0
@entity47 , the @entity6 executive who commissioned the series , said : ' sometimes i used to daydream about what life would be like if one were constantly being followed around by an audience			1
this series has huge potential and we are now waiting to see how the ‘ wisdom of the crowd ’ unfolds			0
' the producers promise that ' heartache , resistance and personal revelations , ' will all feature in the programme			2
the seven - part series , is due to air later this year and comes from the same team behind the award - winning series 24 hours in @entity68			2
executive producer @entity69 added : ' we 're finding , during filming , that living with an audience of 50 people for a week is an incredibly intense experience			2
