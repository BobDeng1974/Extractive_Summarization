criminals are being locked up for longer as the government keeps its promise to be tough on those who break the law , new figures show			2
convictions of celebrity sex abusers are believed to be partly responsible for a larger number of sex offenders being prosecuted , as victims feel more confident about coming forward to expose their abusers			1
the average jail term now stands at 15 1/2 months , three months longer than the average in 2004 , and prisoners are getting longer sentences now than they have done for 20 years , @entity16 ) figures reveal			1
jailed celebrities : @entity19 , 84 , left , and @entity20 , 84 , right , were both jailed for indecently assaulting girls a source close to justice minister @entity23 told @entity24 : ' criminals who break the law and ruin the lives of decent hardworking people have to realise they will go to prison			1
' a slap on the wrist is n't acceptable for those who make others ' lives a misery			2
' the average custodial sentence length ( @entity37 ) , or length of time people are sentenced to , has increased year on year over the last decade , according to the @entity41 's new criminal justice statistics update			0
the new figures , which do n't include life or indeterminate sentences , show that while fines are the most commonly given punishment by all courts , offenders who are sent to jail are facing a longer period inside , particularly sex offenders			1
criminals jailed for sex offences are jailed for longer than any others , with an average sentence of 58.7 months			2
the custody rate for these offenders is also up , with 60 per cent of those convicted of sex offenders being sent to prison , second only to robbers , of whom 64 per cent are jailed			1
this is thought to be due in part to an increase in the number of celebrity sex offenders being convicted for abuse giving victims confidence to come forward			1
in the last year alone , celebrity publicist @entity68 , broadcaster @entity20 and former children 's television presenter @entity19 have all been jailed for sex offences			1
in july , @entity19 was jailed for five years and nine months after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults against four girls			2
the 84 - year - old artist and children 's presenter was jailed by mr @entity76 , who told him he had taken advantage of his celebrity and had shown ' no remorse '			0
a source close to justice secretary @entity23 , left , says people convicted of serious crimes , like publicist and sex offender @entity68 , 71 , right , will face prison sentences rather than a ' slap on the wrist ' former it 's a knockout presenter @entity20 was sentenced to 30 months in jail after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 over a period of 20 years			1
earlier this year , the 84 - year - old was jailed for a further 30 months after admitting indecently assaulting an under - age girl			0
but the judge told him he would have received a ' considerably greater ' sentence had he been prosecuted under current laws			0
under his first sentence , @entity20 would have been due for early release this month at the earliest , but now he will not be eligible for parole until december 2015			0
celebrity publicist @entity68 , 71 , was jailed for eight years in may after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984			2
the sentence imposed by judge @entity108 was far longer than expected , partly , the judge said , because of his ' quite extraordinary ' attitude during the trial , in which he was seen laughing and shaking his head as evidence was given			0
@entity68 was told that had some of offences been tried under today 's law , they would have been considered as rape or assault by penetration with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment			0
the tide of celebrity sex abuse cases is thanks to @entity127 , a national police investigation into decades - old sex crimes perpetrated by television icons such as the late @entity130 and @entity131			1
the government has introduced automatic life sentences for anyone who commits a second violent or sexual offence , ensuring the most serious criminals are dealt with severely			0
the justice minister has said he wants criminals to know that a serious offence will earn them a jail sentence rather than a caution			0
mr @entity23 is currently pushing a bill through parliament to ensure that criminals will no longer receive cautions for serious offences , and for less serious offences they will no longer receive a second caution for the same or similar offence committed in a two - year period .			0

convicted criminals are facing longer jail terms as government cracks down
average jail term is now 15 1/2 months , while for sex offenders it 's five years
more sex offenders are being sent to prison too : 60 per cent of them jailed
tide of celebrity sex offenders jailed thought to be helping conviction rate

justice secretary @entity23 says a ' slap on the wrist ' is n't acceptable
@entity68 , @entity20 and @entity19 all jailed this year for sex abuse
