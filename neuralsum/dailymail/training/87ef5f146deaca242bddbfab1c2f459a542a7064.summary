at only 12 years of age , @entity0 was facing a battle she had never anticipated fighting , and one that she did n't fully understand			1
the very new teenager who had only just entered high school in @entity6 had been diagnosed with a very adult disease - ovarian cancer			1
' i had a doctor 's appointment in the middle of the day , and had to leave school			2
i remember telling my friends that i would only be gone for an hour , ' @entity0 , now 16 , told @entity14			1
' my mum was in the room with me and was in shock			0
when we got out to the waiting room she started crying and calling people , but i just stood there thinking to myself " what 's happening ? " , ' @entity0 said			1
' i remember being wheeled into surgery and seeing mum and saying goodbye to her because i might not see her again			0
that was one of the scariest moments of my life , ' she said			0
' i was pretty naive , i thought that it was a cyst and that the doctors would be able to drain it out with a needle and i 'd have a pinprick scar , ' she said			0
instead , @entity0 left with a 15 centimetre scar and the new knowledge that the lump that had been removed was actually ovarian cancer			1
' when i found out i fell into shock , i did n't know what to think or do , ' @entity0 said			1
before undergoing chemotherapy to fight the ovarian cancer , @entity0 had long red hair during the treatment , @entity0 lost her hair and gained 27 kilograms which made her very self - conscious @entity0 during her chemotherapy treatment without a wig ( left ) and with a wig that she never took off ( right ) ' i 'd seen people in my family going through the same thing			1
my cousin was nine when he died of a brain tumour , and it was shocking seeing him go through the transformation when he had been such a healthy boy , ' she said			0
' all i could think was , " is that going to happen to me ? "			0
' @entity0 , who said she was overwhelmed by the diagnosis , decided not to tell any of her school friends and kept her cancer a secret out of fear that they would treat her differently			1
the high school student went through one cycle of chemotherapy each month , consisting of a week of chemotherapy , a week of recovery and two weeks at school , before the exhausting process would begin again			2
' the nausea was the worst			0
i was put on really harsh drugs and got awful headaches and it turned me off food , but then after the chemo i could n't stop eating , ' @entity0 said			1
' i had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me , ' she said			0
@entity0 said that having a supportive family including her sister ( right ) made a big difference in her fight the high school student went through one cycle of chemotherapy each month , consisting of a week of chemotherapy , a week of recovery and two weeks at school ' i had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me , ' @entity0 said ' but towards the end it got so tough , and i begged not to go into the last cycle			1
i was just so tired and drained			0
' in six months @entity0 had put on 27 kilograms from the treatment and had lost her hair			1
she used a wig in her natural red hair colour and would rarely let anyone see her without it on			0
' it was a huge blow to my social life and how i felt about my appearance			2
i always tried to be strong for myself but it was very hard , ' she said			0
' i remember asking my dad , " how can you love me ? how can anyone love me ? "			0
i had no hair , i had put on a lot of weight			2
' @entity0 said the chemotherpay was a huge blow to my social life and how she felt about her appearance ' towards the end of it i remember asking my dad , " how can you love me ? how can anyone love me ? "			1
i had no hair , i had put on a lot of weight , ' @entity0 said once @entity0 had completed the chemotherapy treatments she was no longer eligible to attend support groups , as she was technically not considered a ' cancer kid ' any longer			1
' i had that taken away from me , and then when i went to school i was the kid with cancer			0
i was excluded from both normalities , ' she said			0
' it took a lot of time for me to get used to myself and other people , which i actually consider harder than the treatment			0
' four years on from her diagnosis , @entity0 is preparing for her @entity148 and has dreams of working as a medical professional herself			1
while she said she has been very blessed with a group of loving friends and a great boyfriend , she said she still has to think about how the cancer will impact her future			0
the ovarian cancer means that she may not be able to have children in the future , a thought which she said it ' pretty crazy '			1
while @entity0 said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people @entity0 said she has been very blessed with a group of loving friends and a great boyfriend ( left ) four years on from her diagnosis , @entity0 is preparing for her @entity148 and has dreams of working as a medical professional herself ' when i was going through the treatment i always just thought that i would worry about babies later			1
but realising that if i do find someone that i want to spend my life with and that i might not be able to give them or myself the life we want is scary , ' @entity0 said			2
the 16 - year - old said that she is determined to ' do something great ' with her life , and is passionate about raising awareness about ovarian cancer			1
' i was dealt some pretty bad cards early in life and i 'm adamant to turn it around and make the most of it , ' @entity0 said			2
while @entity0 said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people , she said it reminds her to be the best possible version of herself that she can be			2
' i have had some amazing opportunities come from something not so great , and so i want to do something not just for me but for other people , ' she said			0
@entity0 is passionate about reminding cancer sufferers that there is always support available , no matter what they are going through			1
' if i can help someone or if someone knows they 're not alone in experiencing cancer , if i can bring comfort to help someone by sharing my story , then that 's what this has all been about , ' she said			2
