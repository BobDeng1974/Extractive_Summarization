@entity0 has questioned sir @entity1 over @entity3 's failure to win the @entity4 in 2012 and their 2009 @entity6 defeat			1
the former first - team coach queried @entity1 's decision to drop @entity9 for their defeat at @entity12 in a match they lost 1 - 0 which he believes handed the title to cross-town rivals @entity18 three years ago			2
and he also queried the @entity20 's starting xi for their clash with @entity22 in @entity23 in which they were beaten 2 - 0			1
@entity0 ( right ) believes sir @entity1 's tactics cost @entity3 more silverware @entity0 believes @entity1 's decisions saw @entity3 miss out on the 2011 - 12 @entity4 and 2008 - 09 @entity6 to @entity18 and @entity22 respectively @entity0 ( left ) worked as part of @entity1 's first - team coaching staff between 2007 - 2013 @entity0 , who enjoyed two spells at @entity30 before leaving when @entity31 was appointed in 2013 , made the comments in an interview with fanzine @entity35			1
referring to the 2012 title race , which saw @entity18 pip their rivals to the post , the @entity36 highlighted the april night match at the @entity41 as the one in which @entity3 blew it			2
' that 's where we lost the league , ' he said			0
' the manager thought that @entity9 , our key player and the one who could change the rhythm of the game , was n't right to play two games in a week ( @entity3 had beaten @entity53 on the saturday , a match @entity9 scored in ) and for that reason he was n't in the squad and we missed him			2
' @entity57 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity12 beat @entity3 1 - 0 in april 2012 @entity0 , who was sacked after a short stint in charge at @entity62 following his departure from @entity3 , added : ' we could n't score and we should have had a penalty at the end but @entity66 did n't give it			2
' the 50 - year - old , now with @entity70 club @entity69 , also revealed what happened on the last day of the 2011 - 12 season at @entity73 where , following their victory , @entity3 were top of the table and set to become champions before @entity79 's late winner for @entity18 against @entity53 snatched the title away from them			1

' ' i went into the tunnel to meet @entity85 , our video man			0

' i thought we had enough quality to deal with them , ' he said			0
' in hindsight , i think we did n't pick the right team with ( @entity111 ) @entity110 , ( @entity113 ) @entity112 and ( @entity9 ) @entity9 on the bench			0
