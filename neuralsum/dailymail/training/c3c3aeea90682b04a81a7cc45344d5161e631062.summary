' i repeat that the president managed to break the fall			2
' oh the irony : @entity1 can be seen running from what is believed to be @entity2 security forces @entity75 , @entity1 , run : considering the hippo is one of the world 's deadliest animals , @entity1 did right in running high flip : as well as surfing the @entity83 meme sees the dictator try his hand at skateboarding evolution : humankind evolves from ape , to @entity90 , to ... @entity1 some @entity12 memes also made fun of his staff , who allegedly asked photographers to delete images of the president when he took a tumble @entity1 took a tumble as he walked down some steps from a podium where he had been addressing the crowd at @entity24			1
