@entity10 claims she feared for her life after managing to swallow her toothbrush whole according to @entity14 , the 19 - year - old from @entity16 felt the tooth brush slipping down her throat but could n't do much to stop it			1
it was reported that @entity21 , a student at @entity22 , has no gag reflex			1
‘ i thought i was going to choke to death and was stunned when i [ realised ] it was n’t stuck in my throat and i could breathe , ’ she told the @entity24 doctors allegedly told the teen that there was nothing they could do , and she should just wait for ‘ nature to take care of things ’			1
i thought i was going to choke to death and was stunned when i realised it was n't stuck in my throat and i could breathe , ' she said ‘ nobody knows where it is as x-rays do n’t show plastic			0
it could be dissolving in my intestines or may already have passed through , ’ she continued			0
and it seems that toothbrushes may not as innocuous as we thought			0
according to the latest statistics from the @entity49 , there were 20 toothbrush - related accidents in the past year			2
earlier this year there were reports of an @entity54 women having a toothbrush removed from her stomach			2
@entity58 accidentally swallowed the toothbrush while leaning over the tap as she cleaned her teeth and it slipped down her throat			2
but when she first went to the hospital to have the toothbrush removed doctors did n't believe her as nothing showed up on x-ray or ultrasound scans			1
it was eventually discovered in a @entity70 scan and removed by using endoscopic equipment			0
her doctor dr. @entity72 , who removed the toothbrush , said at the time : ‘ the lesson learned from this incident is that with all the technology and all our experience , doctors have to listen to the patients			1
’ and a @entity83 teenager suffered a similar fate while brushing her teeth and running up the stairs			0
she tripped and fell , pushing it down into her mouth			0
her younger brother came to help stop her from choking but the gag reflex caused her to swallow the toothbrush whole before it could be pulled out .			1

@entity10 claims she managed to swallow her toothbrush whole as she has no gag reflex
doctors say they can do nothing , and nature must ' take its course '
