@entity0 has set the scene for another @entity2 spectacular at the @entity3 this week with the extraordinary prediction that he could win ‘ 15 or 20 majors ’			1
the greatest golfer of all time shrugged off his usual conservative approach to lavish praise on the @entity10 to whom he has become something of a mentor			1
‘ i think @entity2 is an unbelievable talent , ’ said the @entity0 , who holds the all - time record with 18 majors			1
‘ it depends on what he feels his priorities are but i think he has the opportunity to win 15 or 20 majors if he wants to keep on playing			2
i love his swing , his rhythm , his spirit			0
he has got a little swagger there , it ’s a little bit cocky but it is not offensive			0
i like that self - confidence in a young man			0
‘ he ’s got an unbelievable amount of speed in his golf swing			0
he obviously hits it a long way but he does it consistently , with control			2
’ @entity0 has been there for @entity2 ever since the latter played in @entity0 ’s tournament in @entity53 in 2009			1
in may , the pair had a 90 - minute working lunch where @entity2 asked for the great man ’s guidance			1
it can not be just a coincidence that since then @entity2 has been playing with @entity0 - like focus and turning in some of the best golf of his life			1
at 22 , @entity2 became the youngest winner of the @entity64 in 80 years when he started his major account in 2011 and broke @entity0 ’s record for the largest winning margin at the @entity68 @entity3 when he claimed that the following year by eight strokes			1
after winning @entity24 last month , he joined @entity0 and @entity70 as the only men to win three majors by the age of 25			1
in relaxed mood : @entity2 wanders around @entity32 in the company of close friend @entity76 bunker down : @entity2 practises in the sand ahead of the final major of the year in @entity79 taken under his wing : @entity0 is a long - time supporter of @entity2 now he starts as firm favourite this week to add the season ’s final major to @entity24 and the @entity84 he won in his previous two outings			1
one foe he would not have expected to come across was @entity70 , who had to withdraw during the final round of the @entity84 on sunday with back trouble			0
to general astonishment and against all odds , @entity70 turned up at @entity32 and went out for a practice round shortly after 2pm			2
@entity70 has won 14 majors but his last was in 2008 and his injury troubles over the last few years have shown that challenging @entity0 ’s record is so dependant on staying fit			1
one man who was delighted to see @entity70 was @entity68 @entity97 captain @entity96			0
‘ i ’ve talked to him and texted him and i think the fact he is here tells me that he wants to make our team , ’ said @entity96 , who also announced that @entity98 , who just happens to be @entity70 ’s best pal on tour , will be one of his vice-captains			0
@entity98 said it was vital for @entity68 ’s chances at @entity110 next month that @entity70 was able to get healthy			0
‘ i know how deeply he wants to be a part of this team and i think that ’s why he is here at @entity32 , ’ said @entity98			2
‘ he was on that last team at @entity115 that did n’t get it done and he wants to help us make amends			0
‘ we will see how he gets on this week but hopefully he will come through it feeling healthy and he gets his game going in the right direction			2
’ @entity96 said he would leave it to @entity70 to decide whether he was fit enough for @entity110			0
‘ if he tells me he is healthy and he ’s playing well , he will be on the team , ’ he said .			0

with three majors to his name at 25 , @entity0 says @entity2 can usurp his tally of 18 titles
the @entity0 enthused about the @entity10 *'s* game
@entity0 has long been a @entity2 *fan* and the pair dined together in may , with @entity2 winning @entity24
@entity2 is favourite to win at @entity32 after winning his past two tournaments
