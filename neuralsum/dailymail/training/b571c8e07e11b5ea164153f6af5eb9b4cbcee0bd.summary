by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 23 august 2013 exactly what went on inside the cafe is unclear , but one thing 's for sure : the hapless thief was n't about to go back in after whoever he upset showed him the way out			2
in what appears to be a botched burglary on a cafe in @entity10 , the thief was thrown out of an upstairs window sideways , before free - falling 10ft onto the hard concrete pavement below			1
they say there is honour among thieves , but instead of helping the stricken burglar to his feet , an accomplice on a motorbike races away from the scene leaving his friend to fend for himself			0
dense : this burglar proved @entity26 's theory of gravity after he was flung through an open window botched : the thieves pull up outside the cafe on a motorbike			1
the passenger jumps off and climbs the steps free - fall : suddenly the burglar comes flying out of an open window			1
the highest part of his body here was his foot despite his bruising experience , the burglar was up on his feet in a flash and - snatching his baseball cap from the pavement , which fell off his head during the fall - flees on foot			2
one can only imagine what happened when the burglar , dressed in a t - shirt , shorts and baseball cap , entered the building and disappeared from view			0
perhaps he was expecting the @entity58 to be empty leaving him free to steal anything of value			0
but it is probably safe to things did not quite go according to plan and this will not go down as the crime of the century			0
i 'm off : the getaway driver looks around to see his friend lying in a heap			1
rather than help him up , he screams away wait for me ! stopping to pick up his cap , the hapless burglar flees on foot			0
