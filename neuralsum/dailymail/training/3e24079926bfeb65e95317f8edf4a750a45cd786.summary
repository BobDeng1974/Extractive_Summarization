with its unnervingly - shaped eyes and strange frown - lined mouth it looks like it could be a visitor from another planet			0
but a closer look reveals that this is no alien creature from far beyond the stars - but a human being just like you and me			2
for @entity11 has flipped images of human faces to create the wonderfully twisted perspectives as part of her alienation series of photographs			1
the @entity20 - based photographer says she was inspired to create the series after reading the words of @entity24 motivational speaker @entity23 who said that if you change the way you look at things , the things you look at change			2
and that 's certainly the case here , as eyebrows become odd furry tufts , frowns are turned into mouths and heads seem to transform themselves into chins			0
all in all , it 's safe to say that these eerie images are certainly out of this world			0
take me to your leader : wispy tufts of eyebrow hair and deep frown lines make this face look like a creepy alien in close - up we come in peace : large wise eyes and a neutral expression suggest that this visitor has the wisdom of the universe in its hands helmet off : while this portrait , resembling the creature from the popular @entity61 series of films , could be an example of a more warlike space traveller change of view : @entity11 has flipped images of human faces to create some wonderfully twisted perspectives turning heads : the portraits are part of the @entity20 - based photographer 's alienation series that seeks to challenge our perceptions peekaboo : the wide staring eyes belonging to this startled chap would not look out of place in the famous cantina scene in @entity82 why so sad ? this mournful fellow with a permanent frown seems to have the weight of many worlds resting on its shoulders frown turned upside down : this flipped forehead has been transformed into a spectacular square jaw - with a super-sized smile to match the photographer was inspired to create the series after reading the words of @entity24 motivational speaker @entity23 ... ... who famously said that if you change the way you look at things , then the things you look at change phone home : this et lookalike could have problems - he does n't seem to have a mouth to make the call the images have all been flipped , cropped and darkened to create a twisted vision of something that 's essentially familiar fantastic facial hair : upside - down eyebrows and a thick head of hair means this fantastic creature appears to have a rather splendid beard close encounter : human faces seem almost unrecognisable after photographer @entity11 has finished with them live long and prosper : the many lines around the eyes and forehead in this portrait suggest a wise and long - lived existence among the stars			1
