@entity0 may have suffered a triumphant fall at last night 's @entity2 , but it was @entity5 's jokes that really fell flat			1
the 42 - year - old comedian has come under fire for suggesting that @entity0 was taking @entity9 drugs			1
@entity5 was invited to present @entity11 @entity10 alongside the @entity13 model @entity14			0
' i 'm so excited about @entity0 ' he said ' i snuck into her dressing room back stage earlier and there 's a lot of drugs back there			1
' a stunned @entity14 then tries to change the subject saying ' anyway			0
' but the comedian quickly interrupts with : ' but do n't worry it 's all @entity9 stuff			2
' an obviously unimpressed @entity14 rolls her eyes and briskly moves on by announcing the nominees for the awards before presenting the award to @entity41 on behalf of @entity42			0
@entity43 tweeted his support for @entity0 and even gave @entity5 a taste of his own medicine he later tweeted that he had been impressed by @entity0 's recovery after her fall @entity0 suffered a fall after she was dragged by her cape off stage during her performance last night the comment that suggests that the 56 - year - old singer is taking @entity54 ( a treatment that relieves symptoms of the menopause ) has since been met with heavy critiscm from @entity16 users			1
@entity60 was quick to point out his disgust at the tasteless joke and even went as far as to give @entity5 a taste of his own medicine			2
he tweeted : ' i like @entity5 but @entity65 his @entity9 / drugs gag about @entity0 at @entity2			1
@entity67 , anti-woman , cheap			0
maybe his stand - up relies on @entity69			0
' other @entity16 users also took to the @entity71 to express their disgust with the joke many agreed that @entity5 's joke had been a flop the presenter then added in a later tweet : ' and @entity0 's recovery from a really bad fall was the perfect reply			1
well done @entity82 ' @entity5 did n't just leave a bad taste in @entity43 's mouth either with thousands of tweets flooding in criticising the comedian			0
one user said : ' what 's going on with the @entity89 this year ? so many awkward moments			0
bad @entity9 joke by @entity5 too			2
let 's have a go at older women shall we ? ' while another tweeted their support for the singer : ' @entity0 had the accident and yet it was @ jimmycarr who died on stage at the @entity102 tonight			1
. ' as well as his @entity9 gag @entity5 made another flop when he attempted to poke fun at gender equality			2
' i just think it 's crazy in this day and age that we have separate awards and toilets for men and women ' said @entity5 which seemed an equally frosty reception			0
a lot of the tweets suggested that it was the sexist nature of the joke that was most distasteful other 's suggested that such a bad joke could even result in the end of @entity5 's career many of the tweets shared a support of @entity0 after @entity5 's jibe			1

@entity5 presented @entity129 at last night 's @entity102
he said that @entity0 's dressing room was full of drugs
but added that they were all varieties of @entity9
