from the outside , @entity0 seemed to have it all			1
a wife , an adorable two - year - old daughter , and a six - figure salary job with a leading tech company in @entity7 that he loved			1
but apparently the dream combination is not so perfect			0
the 36 - year - old quit his job to be a house - husband - and now he could n't be happier			1
packed it in : @entity0 worked for fashion site @entity14 , but ditched his job to spent time at home speaking to @entity18 , he said : ' i started to ask myself , " what am i working so hard for ? why are we trying to make our lives so great but are n't investing in time with our child ? " ' he ' felt terrible ' about not seeing his little girl @entity24 , @entity0 said , and struggled to flit between the roles of employee and dad			1
after working at @entity28 , he moved over to @entity14 to be their chief product officer			1
though he had pushed himself to get there , he realized it might not be the goal he was aiming for			2
' i was n’t spending any time with her in the evening , ' @entity0 told the site			1
the playground , he told @entity18 , was the worst			2
' i would look down at my phone a lot because i did n’t know how to socialize there			0
' i did n’t know what to say			0
but i ’m slowly starting to make my way into that circle			0
it ’s about being there over and over again , i think			0
and now that i ’ve done this a few times , and i ’m recognizing people in the neighborhood , it ’s gotten better			0
' so in january , he handed in his notice			0
alongside @entity0 's savings , his wife @entity53 , 34 , is supporting the family with her job as a recruitment manager at data analytics firm @entity59			1
he concedes that it feels uneasy at times : ' i 've had occasional sleepless nights over our finances			0
' but the reality is that i ’m fortunate that i ’ve been working nonstop for a long time so it was n’t as difficult a transition for us financially as it could have been			2
' @entity0 is part of a growing faction of men who are subverting the traditional parental set - up to spend more time with their children			1
according to a recent study by @entity78 , 46 per cent of fathers are dissatisfied with the amount of time they spend with their children			2
though he may consider working part - time when @entity24 starts school , he has vowed to make sure she remains his focus			1
' seeing @entity24 grow from little girl to a big girl is so rewarding and i ca n’t say that i would have seen it this way if i ’d been working all day , every day , ' he told @entity18			2
' from that lens , if we can live like this a while , it ’ll be totally worth it			0
it already think it is			0
