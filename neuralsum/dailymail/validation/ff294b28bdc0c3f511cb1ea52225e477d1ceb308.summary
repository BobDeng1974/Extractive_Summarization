' i vowed i would get revenge , and the moment has finally arrived , ' @entity0 said this morning on the show			1
@entity21 prank : @entity2 used @entity22 to show @entity0 the damage he had done after he had her @entity24 filled with 20,000 ping pong balls as a joke huge mess : when the 57 - year - old opened the door to her car , thousands of ping pong balls came streaming out @entity0 explained that he and his colleagues have been the targets of several of @entity2 's pranks in the past few weeks , before noting that it all ' ends today '			1
he then showed some footage of the today crew filling @entity2 's black @entity36 with 20,000 ping pong balls which had pictures of him posed with @entity2 printed on them , while she filmed an episode of her talk show inside			1
@entity0 even had the crew place a life - size cardboard cut - out of himself in one of the front seats , so that @entity2 would have no doubt about who was responsible for the mischievous prank			1
they also changed her license plate to read ' @entity50 '			0
in shock : @entity2 was in disbelief when she first saw her car that was stuffed to the brim next step : she did n't know what else to do except open the door to her car and lets the ping pong balls out when @entity2 walked into the parking lot and saw her car , she yelled : ' seriously ? i mean seriously			2

' you think you can just do this ? ’ she asked			0
' someone eventually brought @entity2 and @entity74 so she could @entity73 act of revenge : while she tried to clean out her car , @entity2 vowed to get @entity0 back for his trick starting to worry : while talking to @entity0 on @entity22 , @entity2 told him that her previous pranks were just fun and games			1
' now it 's on @entity0 , ' she warned him ' have you seen this ? ’ she asked him			2
she added : ' oh , i am great			0
we were just about to start a beer pong tournament , so i needed like 20,000 ping pong balls , so the jokes on you @entity0			2

' can i just end by telling you the obvious ? i adore you			0
' buckle up : @entity2 tried to get into her car despite it still being filled with thousands of ping pong balls all ready : she managed to close the door , but she knew that there was no way she could drive her @entity24 home in this condition more fun : @entity2 then opted to jump out of the car and swim into the pile of ping pong balls that had fallen out and while @entity2 said that she adored him as well , she warned him that he has raised the stakes – and hinted that he should prepare himself for an impressive round of retaliatory revenge pranks			2
' before it was fun and games			0
it was jokes , ' she said			0
' now it is on @entity0			2
' @entity2 tried to get into her car and drive home , but quickly realized it was impossible , and instead opted to abandon her attempt in favour of swimming through the ping pong balls that surrounded her car in the parking lot			0
back in the studio , @entity0 revealed he was having second thoughts about pulling a joke on the master prankster			0
making plans : the today show crew can be seen filling @entity2 's car while she was in the @entity138 studios taping her talk show personal touch : the ping pong balls even featured a small picture of @entity0 and @entity2 on them ' you know the definition of a nano second ? ’ he asked his co-hosts			1
' it is the period of time between feeling good about getting her back and fearing for your life			0
' @entity152 noted : ' i thought it was on before			0
' ' that was supposed to be closure for you , ' @entity155 added			0
and to prove that his prank was all in good fun , @entity0 revealed that he never intended to leave @entity2 stranded			1
the feud continued : even before she knew about @entity0 's prank , @entity2 had another trick up her sleeve			1
her latest spoof video made it look like 81 - year - old @entity167 was tearing off his close on the today show sultry interview : @entity0 can bee seen laughing as he watched @entity167 ask ' him ' if they could be friends with benefits funny moment : at one point during the striptease , @entity2 made it look like @entity178 's bra was flung onto @entity180 's head he had both a car service and a clean - up crew waiting nearby , so @entity2 could get a ride home and her @entity24 cleaned			1
during the segment , @entity0 and his co-hosts also showed a clip of @entity2 's latest spoof video , which showed @entity0 and 81 - year - old actress @entity167 tearing each other 's clothes off on the today show			1
at one point a red bra was flung on to @entity180 's head			0
' this is becoming a great feud , ' @entity152 said before asking @entity2 to leave @entity0 's colleagues , including herself , out of it			1
