living alongside @entity1 and @entity2 on one of the smartest streets in @entity5 , @entity0 might have thought she could n’t go too far wrong by sprucing up her home			1
but when she smoothed away the pebble dash on the front of the house , neighbourly relations quickly turned rocky			2
the residents ’ association condemned the new flat white facade as ‘ unsympathetic ’ and demanded the original frontage should be reinstated on the £ 2.6million property			2
hopes dashed : residents complained that the new look on @entity0 's house ( centre ) was ' unsympathetic ' and @entity20 in north @entity5 has now ordered her to reverse the work ' cheap ' : how the north @entity5 house looked before the pebble dashing was removed by a builder the coarse form of plaster is created by smearing cement over brick and adding small gravel , pebbles or shells on top			1
it was prevalent in the 1920s as a way to cover poor quality brick as builders were forced to cut costs to meet a surge in property demand and following a year - long row , the council has now ordered that ms @entity0 , 45 , must take down the white render and spend around £ 5,000 replacing the pebble dash			1
yesterday ms @entity0 , who works in asset management , claimed the complaints were ‘ personal ’ and designed to ‘ cause maximum distress and financial burden ’ to her			1
the married mother of two , who has lived in the area for 25 years , refuted complaints that the new finish on her detached @entity55 home ‘ jarred ’ with the rest of the street , pointing to ‘ unsightly ’ changes made to neighbouring houses			2
battle : @entity0 said she did not even set out to have the pebble dashing removed the coarse form of plaster is created by smearing cement over brick and adding small gravel , pebbles or shells on top			1
it was prevalent in the 1920s as a way to cover poor quality brick as builders were forced to cut costs to meet a surge in property demand			0
some neighbours have come forward to support her , saying the original pebble dash facade looked ‘ cheap ’ and it was a shame her ‘ transformation ’ would be lost			0
but in their letter to the council , the residents ’ association claimed the work was a ‘ severe violation ’ that ‘ jarred ’ with the character of the exclusive street in @entity90 , north @entity5 , where house prices average £ 3million			1
miss @entity1 and her mother @entity92 live on the road , as does miss @entity2 and her husband , @entity95 star @entity94			1
and @entity96 has even lent her support to ms @entity0 , saying : ‘ i ’d rather they replaced the pebble dash than dug out one of those awful basement holes and added extra floors underneath			2
’ the bizarre row began after ms @entity0 employed builders to refurbish her home and they removed the pebble dash			1
the @entity107 conservation area advisory committee – which has some members living on the street – complained to @entity20 and she was sent an enforcement notice			1
the council said that the work had been carried out in a conservation area without the required planning permission , ‘ causing harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene ’			0
ms @entity0 ’s application for retrospective permission was dismissed and she was given three months to reverse the work			2
in appeal documents , she said she had canvassed the opinion of her neighbours who were unopposed to the new facade			0
she said it was her belief that the ‘ unfortunate situation ’ was caused by a ‘ somewhat personal challenge ’			0
but the conservation body said a ‘ significant number ’ of neighbours were ‘ unhappy that the finish is out of keeping with the rest of the street ’			2
exclusive : the house is in @entity90 , where the average price of a home is £ 3million neighbours : the street is also home to the actresses @entity2 and oscar - winner @entity1 an anonymous letter written by a member of the group said that the ‘ unique mix of @entity55 and @entity149 architectural features ’ in the area was ‘ being eroded through unsympathetic , and in many cases , forbidden alterations ’			1
rejecting ms @entity0 ’s appeal , planning inspector @entity154 said the white finish was ‘ stark and bland ’ and removing pebble dash would ‘ result in the loss of local character and distinctiveness ’			1
but @entity162 ms @entity0 told the @entity163 her neighbours were disappointed that she had lost the battle with the council			1
she said : ‘ i did n’t specifically ask for [ the pebble dash ] to be removed			0
the builders said they did it to all of the houses [ in the area ] and said it had never been an issue			0
unfortunately , in my road , it is an issue			0
‘ anyone walking along the street would see that not all the houses are pebble dashed			0
‘ i ’ve accepted my fate			0
i just think the rules should be clearer for residents about what can and ca n’t be done			0
it ’s such a shame because the builders have created such a beautiful finish and now i have to ask them to put the pebble dashing up			0

@entity0 , 45 , lives in same @entity5 street as @entity1
but neighbours complained her removal of dated front was ' unsympathetic '
after year - long planning row @entity20 has told her to restore it
