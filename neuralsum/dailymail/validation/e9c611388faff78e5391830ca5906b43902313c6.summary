it says something for the way things have changed in @entity5 football that @entity6 admitted only last week that @entity7 have no chance of winning the @entity9			1
the same , of course , could be said of @entity11			1
it is , we should remind ourselves , only the start of march			0
given @entity11 ’s enduring financial capacity , it should not be too long before the most successful club of the @entity9 era are competing with @entity19 and @entity20 at the top of the table once more			1
( left to right ) @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 warm - up during training on sunday @entity23 ( left ) and @entity29 share a joke as @entity11 step up their preparations for their clash with @entity7 @entity33 ( left ) , @entity34 ( centre ) and @entity36 arrive at the @entity37 red devils centre back @entity39 ( left ) stretches out during his side 's training session @entity25 , pictured with @entity26 , took part in sunday 's training session despite his six - match suspension @entity11 duo @entity45 and @entity46 are both expected to start against @entity7 @entity47 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) will be hoping to start against @entity6 's side as for @entity7 , it is more difficult to say			1
@entity6 ’s team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now			2
whatever the case , on monday night at @entity55 , these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the @entity59			1
with @entity11 not involved in @entity60 this season and @entity7 staring at likely @entity63 expulsion in @entity64 next week — they trail 3 - 1 after the last - 16 home leg — victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view			1
no wonder @entity11 staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to @entity55 in a bid to bolster tonight ’s atmosphere			2
this may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one			0
‘ @entity11 and @entity7 are placed third and fourth in the @entity9 so it ’s almost like a final , i think , ’ said @entity11 manager @entity81			1
‘ it is a big event with two good teams			0
i hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans			0
@entity11 boss @entity81 is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at @entity55 last summer @entity90 during @entity11 's training session at @entity37 on sunday ahead of the game ‘ i think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us			1
it is a very important game , not only for the @entity59 but also for the rest of the season			1
’ @entity11 have not won the @entity59 for 11 years			1
@entity7 are the holders after last season ’s victory over @entity102 but , prior to that , their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005			1
this says much for the manner in which both clubs ’ focus has been elsewhere for so long			0
@entity7 and @entity11 have always valued the @entity59 but , during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in @entity60 , it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list			1
that is no longer the case			0
@entity116 in particular has been respectful towards the game ’s most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in @entity119 last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him — and his club — if @entity11 could win it			2
the first trophy @entity116 ever won as a coach was @entity128 ’s @entity127 with @entity129 in 1993			2
he still considers his first @entity131 championship , which arrived a year later , as the most important trophy of his coaching career			0
but he admitted he understood @entity135 ’s view that his most crucial success in @entity5 was his first — the 2005 @entity138 triumph			0
@entity139 evads the challenge for @entity141 during @entity7 's sunday training session at @entity143 @entity7 forward @entity144 gets through some speed work at his side 's @entity147 base @entity141 strides forward during the @entity150 ' last field session before facing @entity11 on monday night the @entity150 squad are put through their paces as they look to reach @entity153 for the third time in two years @entity155 puts in the effort with a sprint as @entity159 ' team got ready for the vital game at @entity55 ‘ you can say you play for your profession but that is not enough , ’ said @entity116			1
‘ you want to win something			0
that is why you play and coach			0
the players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans			0
‘ when you win a title like the @entity59 , which in @entity5 is very important , and when you fight for something and you get it , you are pleased and that is why @entity135 is saying what he says about his first one			2
‘ when you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important			0
and when a player wins something , they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things			0
’ @entity116 was not hired last summer to win the @entity59			2
he knows he must get @entity11 back into the @entity63			1
no @entity9 club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money - spinning @entity192 competition for more than the odd season			2
similarly , @entity6 knows what his true responsibilities are			2
@entity198 centre forward @entity197 is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the @entity150 on monday night , however , the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams ’ seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that			1
@entity7 have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games			1
with their @entity198 centre forward @entity197 finally looking capable of scoring consistently , the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals			0
they also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge			0
@entity6 's side are current @entity59 champions after their dramatic victory against @entity102 last season @entity11 ’s football , on the other hand , has been more patchy but @entity116 will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at @entity219 last wednesday that had an important feel about it			1
he will also hope his captain @entity90 can use his own rather sketchy @entity59 past as a motivating factor			2
‘ he has not won the @entity59 , ’ said @entity116			1
‘ and that is something that is missing for him			0
‘ my first championship with @entity129 was very important for me , it was also an emotional thing			0
it will be the same for @entity90			0

@entity11 face @entity7 in the @entity59 sixth - round on monday
@entity11 are not involved in @entity60 this season
while @entity7 are staring at likely @entity63 expulsion in @entity64
@entity6 's side trail 3 - 1 after the last - 16 home leg at the @entity239
@entity11 have not won the @entity59 for 11 years
@entity242 hopes @entity11 will play with more *freedom* on monday night
