the @entity0 is asking you to nominate mothers who have created businesses from scratch , while also caring for their children , for our first ever @entity6 , in association with @entity9			1
today ’s nominee is @entity11 , 40 , a divorcee who lives in @entity12 with her son , @entity13 , nine			1
she set up her own business , the west brewery , in 2006 ... listening to the @entity18 businessman on the other end of the line , @entity16 could see pound signs in front of her eyes			1
he had heard about the huge popularity of @entity16 ’s bottled beer			2
now he wanted to meet to discuss importing it in bulk to @entity18			2
it was a fantastic opportunity			2
but , as she consulted her diary , @entity16 — who runs one of @entity35 ’s most successful small breweries , knew what her answer had to be			1
@entity11 , 40 ( pictured ) , is a divorcee who lives in @entity12 with her son , @entity13 , nine ( pictured )			1
she set up her own business , the west brewery , in 2006 ‘ he could only offer me a two - hour slot bang in the middle of my son ’s sports day last year , ’ recalls @entity16			1
‘ i had to say no. i ’m a businesswoman , but i ’m a mum first			2
’ blonde , attractive and the founder of one of @entity35 ’s most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of £ 10 million , @entity16 may well be every man ’s dream			1
but she says with a laugh : ‘ i sound like a real catch			2
but the truth is i ’m fiercely independent , stubborn and work long hours			2
the only man in my life is @entity13			1
he ’s my priority and the reason i drive myself so hard			2
’ as a single mother , running a hugely successful business is a tall order			1
what makes @entity16 ’s success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when @entity13 was just a baby — and in the wake of a broken marriage			1
@entity16 ’s flagship beer , @entity66 , is stocked in 100 branches of @entity68 in the @entity35 as well as in branches of @entity70 in @entity71			2
and later this year she is opening a second brewery in @entity12 to cope with demand			1
the germ of the idea came in 1994 when @entity16 , who was born in @entity77 , was having a drink with her father , @entity79 , in a pub. ‘ i was studying at @entity81 and @entity82 had come to visit , ’ she recalls			2
@entity16 ( pictured ) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her @entity12 and she realised that the city did n't have its own brewery he ordered a pint of local lager , took a sip and winced			1
then he asked what the best @entity12 lager was and , to my horror , i realised i did n’t know			1
‘ in @entity77 , every village and town has a good brewery			2
it ’s something people are proud of and want to show off to visitors			0
he could n’t believe that a city like @entity12 did n’t have its own brewery			1
’ twelve years later , @entity16 opened a small brewery and beer hall / restaurant with her then husband , @entity104 , with the help of a loan from her parents			1
‘ i met @entity104 at university and married him in december 2000 , ’ recalls @entity16			0
‘ we both had first - class business degrees and , naively , i thought that meant we could easily run a business			2
i was working as a lawyer , so we agreed @entity104 would take charge and i would take a back seat			0
’ @entity118 opened in march 2006 , just eight months after @entity13 was born			1
‘ he was conceived on a trip to @entity121 , where we ’d gone to learn about brewing , ’ @entity119 recalls			1
‘ i had been told that i could never have children so , although the timing was terrible because of the new business , we were both ecstatic			0
’ she adds : ‘ we had bills to pay , so i was working three days a week just two months after @entity13 arrived			1
with my legal job and a newborn , i did n’t have time to think about the business			0
besides , i thought it was in safe hands			0
’ the @entity118 opened in march 2006 , just eight months after @entity119 's son , @entity13 was born			1
she initially started the company with @entity137 , her then husband however , in october 2006 , when @entity13 was just three months old , @entity119 ’s life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart			1
‘ i was so devastated , i decided to step away from the business			0
i focused on looking after @entity13 and my job			1
’ however , in december 2007 , a little over a year after the break - up of their marriage , @entity16 had another shock : the business was in crisis			1
‘ @entity104 was away when the butcher who supplied our restaurant rang and threatened to set fire to my car , ’ she recalls			2
‘ it turned out the company owed him thousands			0
‘ when i went round to the company ’s office			0
i filled a black bin liner with our unpaid invoices , went home and spent the night going over them			0
we had debts up to our eyeballs			0
’ many women would have quit			0
but looking at her son , @entity16 realised she did n’t have a choice			2
‘ it was sink or swim			0
@entity13 gave me the confidence i needed , ’ says @entity119			1
‘ we had ploughed my inheritance into the business			0
it was all i had			0
besides , i knew i ’d hit on a great idea			0
all it needed was graft to make it work			0
my parents agreed to look after @entity13 for seven weeks in @entity77			1
the company went into administration			0
i called in a brilliant firm of accountants and worked flat out on a plan for the future			0
@entity16 ( pictured with @entity13 ) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles ‘ it was tough			1
@entity13 went into full - time day care and most nights i would still be at my laptop at 1am			1
many times , i sobbed myself to sleep			0
i felt way out of my depth , but i became good at multi-tasking			0
‘ i quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it , single - handedly , into the thriving company it is today			1
we are now a beer brand as well as a restaurant and beer hall			0
and our flagship beer , @entity66 , is sold worldwide			0
we are just about to send a consignment to @entity212			0
of course , i have to make tough choices			0
i could beat myself up about not being there enough for @entity13			1
i ’ve lost count of the number of times he will be in the car and i have to shush him because i ’m taking an important call			0
‘ but feeling guilty is just a waste of energy			0
@entity13 knows he ’s my priority			1
we are a very tight unit — particularly as his father now lives in @entity226			2
we have the most wonderful full - time nanny , @entity228 , who @entity13 adores , and i spend every second i ’m not working with him			1
‘ recently he said : “ mum you are a brilliant @entity232 and a brilliant @entity82			0
” that meant the world to me			0
‘ and thanks to the business , we have a great lifestyle			0
for my 40th birthday i bought us a treat : a speedboat			0
it ’s moored at @entity241 and zipping up and down the water at weekends makes a tough working week worthwhile			2
