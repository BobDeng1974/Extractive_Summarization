a @entity1 motorist was shocked to discover his £ 5,000 car had been frozen solid in a block of ice after leaving it parked on the side of the street during a heavy snow storm			1
@entity9 , 32 , left his @entity10 parked in a small ditch beside a block of flats in the city of @entity15 , south - west @entity1			1
the small ditch filled with water overnight and by the time @entity19 had returned to the car in the morning , the water had frozen solid above the level of the wheels			1
@entity9 parked his £ 5,000 @entity10 , pictured , in a drainage ditch overnight outside a block of flats when @entity9 returned to his car the following morning he discovered it was frozen in a block of ice the water flooded into the car , almost covering the seats , pictured , before it froze into a solid lump @entity9 asked several of his friends and neighbours to help him try to free the car , but after an hour of trying to chip away at the solid block of ice , they were forced to give up after temperatures plummeted to minus 30 @entity40			1
@entity9 said : " we tried pouring hot water over it but that just froze and made it worse			2
' we then tried hacking the ice away with spades and knives , but it is so hard some of them broke			0
' he then called a local car garage to see if they could help , and was told it would be a waste of time			0
garage owner @entity58 , 45 , said : ' i 'm not even sure its worth trying to get free			0
' the engine will be dead from being flooded and i do n't think it can be repaired			0
' in fact , repairing it would cost about the same as getting a new one			0
' @entity9 added : ' i ca n't believe this			0
' if i had n't parked in that ditch this would never have happened , but who would have thought it ? ' i guess the snow must have melted and then when the temperatures fell froze			2
' @entity9 's mechanic warned that after such an ordeal it would be cheaper to buy a new car @entity9 said he tried pouring boiling water over the ice but it froze instantly making the situation worse			1
