@entity0 lit the fuse for another @entity3 victory as the @entity5 hosts signed off preparations with a sturdy but certainly not spectacular 1 - 0 win over @entity8 in @entity9			1
six days away from opening the @entity5 on the other side of the city against @entity14 , @entity11 's side endured a frustrating first - half that ended with the crowd on their backs			1
but a much improved showing after the break - with @entity21 's @entity20 shining after replacing the unimpressive @entity22 - saw them narrowly home			1
to the rescue : @entity0 scored the only goal of the game in @entity29 's final warm - up before the @entity5 @entity0 flicked the ball home in the 58h minute to open the scoring at @entity33 helpless : @entity34 watches on but ca n't prevent the @entity3 forward from scoring @entity29 : @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 71 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 74 ) , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 64 ) , @entity22 ( @entity20 46 ) , @entity47 , @entity0 ( @entity48 75 ) , @entity49			1

on a sodden @entity9 afternoon when a subway strike crippled the metropolis of 20 million people , @entity5 cheer was n't exactly flowing freely on the streets			2
but at @entity33 , the 67,042 packed into the home of @entity9 formed a yellow wall of noise to welcome their front - liners , six days before they begin their quest for history			1
one of the few criticisms of @entity11 is that he can be loyal to a fault but with this staring @entity101 - the very definition of tried and trusted - it is hard to criticise			1
sculpted during last summer 's barnstorming run to the @entity106 title , @entity11 could have named it for the opener a full year out			1
the wonder is that the 2002 @entity5 winning coach , who has always had a lucky streak , has made it to six days out without a single injury concern over any of his starters			1
being able to reunite @entity41 and @entity40 at the heart of the defence , after the skipper missed tuesday 's romp against @entity119 , would have been a relief too			2
@entity11 's @entity29 have never lost under the pairing , winning ten of the previous 12 and keeping six clean sheets			1
on the move : @entity49 ( right ) fights for the ball with @entity8 's @entity61 challenge : @entity3 forward @entity49 is closed down by @entity21 's @entity34 but vital as captain @entity41 may be to the cause there was no doubting who the near full house were here to see			1
@entity49 left his home of @entity9 after the @entity106 to try to do in @entity134 what he had done here for five years previously with @entity137 - electrify			2
if his first season at @entity141 only featured glimpses of that talent , his adoring masses here did n't care			0
from his first touch , the roars rolled around @entity33 's bowl			2
it took just five minutes for him to make a first opponent look silly , @entity67 hacking him down after being outfoxed			0
there were to be only intermittent moments like that in the opening period as the @entity5 hosts struggled to find the rhythm and incision that carved @entity119 to pieces			1
it was left to @entity158 's @entity64 who fired the game 's first shot in anger wide of @entity37 's post 11 minutes in			2
physical : @entity47 ( left ) is brushed off by former @entity164 winger @entity69 tactics : @entity29 's coach @entity11 gives instructions to @entity167 left back @entity42 another of the visitors ' @entity171 contingent , the giant @entity66 , was making his presence felt in midfield and when the @entity21 man crossed for @entity63 soon after the half hour , the lone frontman should have done better instead of flashed his header wide			1
save for a nice turn and shot from @entity0 at the other end and and a @entity40 free - kick that sailed high into the @entity9 sky , there was little to cheer for a crowd that are notoriously fickle			2
the jeers that rung around the arena at @entity190 ' half - time whistle left @entity11 's crew in little doubt that six days before they face @entity14 in the same city , this was not good enough			1
two days after the birth of a baby daughter , the out of sorts @entity22 was withdrawn at the inter @entity20 on the other hand is a man in form , well out of national team contention just 12 months ago , he now finds himself the go - to guy off the bench			1
and he immediately added some much needed spark to proceedings			0
the crowd were still not convinced though , bizarrely chanting the name of @entity9 striker @entity210 - long since out of national team reckoning			2
partisan : @entity3 fans in @entity9 cheer their team 's last game before the @entity5 passionate : the @entity9 crowd booed their team off at half - time after an uninspiring first period maybe that was the spur for current @entity222 though as less than five minutes later it was @entity0 who finally broke the deadlock			1
@entity41 angled a ball to the edge of the box where the @entity230 man outmuscled @entity34 and @entity65 , controlled and in spite of losing his footing and fired into the far corner			0
it was a goal that was all down to strength and endeavour , what the sometimes criticised frontman is all about			0
it was also the cue for a festa in the stands , @entity242 waves and chants ringing around the place in the last half hour			0
message : @entity8 players held up a banner as the two teams lined up before the game @entity67 almost broke up the party on 69 minutes but missed a great opening with a poor header and @entity72 tamely shot at @entity37 soon after			2
at the other end @entity47 had a second wrongly disallowed for offside after a superb through ball by @entity49 but it did little to delate the atmosphere			0
the biggest roar of the night went up on 80 minutes as @entity49 was withdrawn			0
it might not have been a vintage night from him and it may not have been a vintage night from his team but @entity29 still got it done			0
they will return here on thursday with momentum			0
the world have been warned .			0

@entity0 's second - half goal gives hosts the win despite a poor opening 45
@entity21 's @entity20 shone after replacing the unimpressive @entity22
@entity11 's side begin their @entity5 campaign in six days
