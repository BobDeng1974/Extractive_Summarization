it will certainly get a lot tougher for @entity2 from here			1
the @entity3 did not have to perform at anywhere near his peak level to get past @entity7 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 but now comes @entity9 ’s no 1			1
@entity10 and @entity2 will meet in a quarter - final match that shone out when the draw was made before this tournament started : the king of grass versus the emerging prince			1
we can only hope the sun will be shining because it was clear the rain interruptions and gloomy weather made this third - round match a less - than - pleasing spectacle			2
hand it to him : @entity2 celebrates victory over @entity7 to reach the last eight making a name for himself : @entity2 beat @entity7 to book a quarter final place outclassed : @entity7 could n't live with the skills of @entity2 , losing in three sets @entity33 : day seven roundup there were more shanks and slips than shots of awe as the @entity41 ’s champion failed to really get into his groove			1
he took the first set comfortably enough and the second was poised at 6 - 5 when the covers came on			1
around one hour and 45 minutes later the players re-emerged and soon after @entity2 was claiming the set with a fortunate half - volley			1
but @entity7 challenged and found a second chance through @entity50 showing the ball drifting just wide			0
he chucked away his reprieve with a double fault to hand a 2 - 0 lead to @entity2			1
the final set was equally error - strewn but the 11th seed was able to come through on the big points and twice broke the @entity58			2
eyes on the prize : @entity2 will now face @entity10 in the quarter finals stretched to the limit : @entity2 shows off his flexibility as he returns a shot during his win over @entity7 battling effort : @entity7 took the second set to a tie break but ultimately lost out serving for the match @entity2 recovered from 30 - 0 down to take the next four points and step into the last eight here for the first time in his career			1
