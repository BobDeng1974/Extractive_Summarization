@entity0 has caused outrage by commissioning a ' shameless - style ' comedy series based on the @entity3 - a tragedy in which more than a million people died			1
the sitcom , called @entity7 , was recently revealed by @entity9 - based screenwriter @entity8 but has been met with strong opposition - with thousands signing a petition to prevent the show being aired			1
some say the show 's comical stance is an insult to those who died and that the @entity19 potato famine is ' no laughing matter ' and should only be shown in an historical context			1
' i do n't want to do anything that denies the suffering that people went through , but @entity33 has always been good at black humour			1
' we 're kind of thinking of it as shameless in famine @entity33			1
' shameless was a @entity0 hit comedy about a dysfunctional family living in a @entity43 council estate riddled with alcohol and drug abuse			2
period : 1845 - 1849 cause : late blight - a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots of the potato plant			2
late blight : caused by water mold significance : it was the worst famine to occur in @entity55 in the 19th century			0
deaths : more than 1million people emigrated : around two million people by the early 1840s , almost one - half of the @entity19 population - but primarily the rural poor - had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet , and the rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities			0
a heavy reliance on just one or two high - yielding varieties of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease			0
source : @entity76 the @entity3 lasted from 1845 until 1849 when @entity33 formed part of the @entity78			2
one eight of the population died in the four - year period and two million people were forced to emigrate			0
the tv project has been heavily criticised in @entity33 before even being aired - with one @entity9 councillor claiming the show was intended to ' embarrass and denigrate ' one of the most tragic periods in @entity19 history			1
speaking to @entity88 , @entity87 added : ' jewish people would never endorse making a comedy of the mass extermination of their ancestors at the hands of the @entity94			0
' the people of @entity96 , @entity97 or @entity98 would never accept the plight of their people , through generational famine , being the source of humour in @entity104			2
' i am not surprised that it is a @entity78 television outlet funding this venture			0
' anger : @entity9 councillor @entity87 has heavily criticised the show 's premise the councillor is calling on @entity19 broadcasters to reject the project			1
@entity8 , who is best - known for the award - winning @entity19 radio drama @entity116 , said that the broadcasters had given him an ' open commission ' - meaning he could write about anything he wanted			1
so far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition on change.org to prevent the show from being aired			1
the petition reads : ' famine or genocide is no laughing matter , approximately one million @entity19 people died and another two million were forced to emigrate because they were starving			2
' any programme on this issue would have to be of serious historical context ... not a comedy			0
' @entity132 users have also weighed into the argument , with one , @entity134 , calling the show ' unbelievably crass and insensitive '			0
but not everyone is critical of the concept			0
another @entity132 user , @entity138 , posted : ' no concept should be censored for art.			0
. wait until you see how 's it 's presented and what its intent is			0
' he adds : ' same people complaining about @entity0 making a sitcom about famine are same complaining about ' the interview ' being pulled			2
' a @entity0 spokesman said ' we have commissioned a script set in 19th century @entity33 by @entity9 - based writer @entity8 and @entity19 - based production company @entity154 - however this in the development process and is not currently planned to air			1
' outrage : many @entity132 users have reacted angrily to the the proposal of a comedy based on the potato famine so far more than 9,000 people have signed an online petition to prevent @entity7 from being aired by @entity0 defence : there were a few who defended the idea of the programme on social media ' new shameless ' : the proposed show , @entity7 , about the @entity19 potato famine , has been compared to @entity0 comedy shameless by its writer @entity8			1
above @entity176 central character @entity175			0
