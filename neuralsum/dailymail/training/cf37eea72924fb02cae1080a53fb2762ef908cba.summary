miss @entity1 ’s private gp , @entity52 , said the singer had started drinking again three days before her death because she was ‘ bored ’			1

but he said he was not surprised that the fresh ruling matched the original findings of the court			0
@entity1 said he ' expected ' the ruling but he attacked as ' preposterous ' a series of blunders that meant the inquest into @entity1 's death had to be rescheduled after it was revealed the original coroner @entity119 was not properly qualified			1
' that is what we expected			0
it is the same evidence so it was bound to reach the same conclusion			0
what other conclusion could they reach ? ' he said			0

' they messed up twice - once when they sent the original coroner 's report to the wrong address and the second time when a coroner who was n't qualified oversaw the inquest			1

he said : ' there was no need for us to go today			0
if we had been in @entity12 we would n't have gone , i was n't going to put my family through that , it was horrible			1
