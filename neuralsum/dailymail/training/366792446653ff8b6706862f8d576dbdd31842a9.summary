the roots of @entity2 plants contain a substance that acts as a painkiller which is particularly effective for treating chronic , low - level pain			1
image shows the flower of a @entity2 caseana plant an ancient @entity11 herbal remedy could be used to fight chronic pain , new research has revealed			1
the roots of the flowering plant @entity2 – a member of the poppy family - have been used for centuries as a pain reliever			1
now scientists have found they contain a key pain - relieving ingredient known as @entity21 ( @entity22 ) and that they do not lose effectiveness over time like traditional opiate drugs			1
the chemical acts not through the morphine receptor but through other receptors , in particular one that binds dopamine			0
dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain 's reward and pleasure centres and also helps regulate movement and emotional responses			0
@entity38 of the @entity39 , said : ‘ our study reports the discovery of a new natural product that can relieve pain			0
‘ this analgesic acts in animal assays against the three types of pain that afflict humans , including acute , inflammatory , and neuropathic or chronic pain			0
’ he made the discovery as part of the ‘ herbalome ’ project , an effort to catalogue all of the chemical components of traditional @entity11 medicine			1
the @entity2 plants that were the focus of the new study grow mainly in central eastern @entity11 , where underground tubers are harvested , ground , and boiled in hot vinegar			2
those concoctions are often prescribed to treat pain , including headaches and back pain			2
the researchers went looking for compounds in @entity2 that appeared likely to act in a manner similar to morphine			2
dr @entity38 said : ‘ we landed on @entity22 but rapidly found that it acts not through the morphine receptor but through other receptors , in particular one that binds dopamine			0
’ the discovery adds to earlier evidence showing that the dopamine d2 receptor plays a role in pain sensation			0
the plant roots have been used in traditional @entity11 herbal medicine for hundreds of years - they are often used to treat headaches and back pain			1
image shows farmers harvesting the roots in eastern @entity11 while @entity2 extracts , or isolated @entity22 , work against all types of pain , they hold special promise for those who suffer with persistent , low - level chronic pain			1
for one thing , @entity22 does n't appear to lose effectiveness with time in the way that traditional opiate drugs do			1
dr @entity38 said : ‘ we have good pain medications for acute pain - codeine or morphine , for example			2
‘ we have pain medication for inflammatory pain , such as aspirin or acetaminophen			0
‘ we do not have good medications for chronic pain			0
@entity22 may not be able to relieve strong chronic pain , but may be used for low - level chronic pain			1
’ he warned further testing for toxicity is needed before doctors should consider prescribing it to patients			0
the study was published in the journal @entity121 .			0

@entity2 plant roots contain the painkiller *dehydrocorybulbine*
this is not thought to lose effectiveness over time , as opiate drugs do
in traditional @entity11 medicine , the plants are used to treat headaches
they are thought to be most effective at treating persistent , low - level pain
