mps will question @entity2 chief @entity1 next month over the investigation into missing teenager @entity4 mps are set to haul @entity6 's top police officer and prosecutor to the @entity8 over the investigation into missing teenager @entity4			1
@entity2 chief @entity1 and the director of public prosecutions @entity9 will be questioned amid growing anger over foreign criminals living freely in @entity6			1
it comes after it emerged the on - the - run chief suspect in the 14 - year - old 's disappearance is a convicted killer from @entity17			1
@entity18 , 41 , went missing a week after @entity19 vanished while walking close to the @entity20 near her home in west @entity22 on august 28			1
@entity23 shows mr @entity24 riding a bicycle 15 minutes later past the same spot			2
mr @entity28 was jailed in 1998 for his wife 's murder			2
he served seven years before moving to the @entity6			2
he was allowed to stay in the country despite being investigated in 2009 over an alleged indecent assault on a 14 year - old in @entity34 , west @entity22			2
@entity36 chair @entity35 said it was ' absurd ' that officers had not issued a @entity39 for mr @entity28 and vowed to get answers from @entity6 's most senior policeman and prosecutor once @entity43 returned next month			1
mr @entity35 said : ' it 's absurd			1
a @entity39 should have been applied for			0
' at the very least they could have gone before a judge , who may have granted them one			0
' we will be seeking answers			0
' mr @entity35 , speaking to the @entity51 , said it was ' incredible ' that the family of @entity56 sufferer @entity54 were tracked down with an arrest warrant - but not in this case			1
he told the newspaper : ' we need to know whether the problem is with the @entity61 or with the @entity62			0
' @entity64 leader @entity63 has attacked @entity66 freedom of movement rules which stop the government refusing entry to convicted criminals			1
he said : ' convicted @entity17 murderer is suspect in disappearance of @entity4			1
@entity66 rules mean we ca n't stop people like this entering the country			0
' but deputy prime minister @entity78 this morning said the problem was actually @entity66 countries not sharing enough information about criminals crossing borders , risking a furious response from @entity86 mps			1
he called on countries in the @entity66 to share ' much , much more information ' about serious convicted criminals with each other			2
in his @entity94 show on @entity95 this morning , the @entity92 leader said : ' nothing has been proved , but the finger of suspicion is pointing very clearly at this @entity17 individual			1
why did we not know that he had this conviction ? ' where somebody has been convicted of a crime elsewhere in the @entity66 we need to provide much , much more information			2
' he added : ' the countries in the @entity66 do n't send much more information to each other about individuals who have a serious , criminal record			0
that can easily be fixed , ' he said			0
' you can create databases and decide which crime you have on that database			0
you can protect the freedom to move while also protecting our safety by knowing who has a crime against their name so that people can be checked as they move across the @entity66			0
' but a month after @entity19 's disappearance , senior detectives have admitted they still have no idea if the chief suspect remains in the @entity6 or if he has fled overseas			1
commander @entity127 of @entity2 has admitted that even if he was located in @entity17 , they are powerless to arrest or even question him , because at this stage they lack the evidence to apply for a @entity39			1
police who searched the west @entity22 home he shared with his girlfriend and child , found his passport and said he has not used his phone or accessed money from his bank account			2
but there are increasing fears that he may have slipped out of the @entity6 and returned to @entity17 where he could be being sheltered by members of the criminal fraternity he met while in prison			1
police staged a re-enactment of the last sightings of @entity19 as she walked along the towpath at @entity150 bridge in west @entity22 the director of public prosecution @entity9 ( left ) and @entity2 chief @entity1 ( right ) will give evidence to mps next month over the investigation into @entity19 's disappearance it comes as the desperate family of the missing teenager spoke of their ' agony ' over her disappearance as police staged a reconstruction of her last known steps on the day she went missing			1
worried father @entity164 , 60 , mother @entity165 , 50 , and sister @entity166 , 19 , pleaded with @entity19 to return home , and spoke of how they longed to hear the musical teenager sing again and see her smile			0
' @entity19 has been missing for four weeks now , ' the family said in a statement			2
' we are desperately concerned about her welfare and worry constantly about what may have happened to her			0
' we are appealing to @entity19			0
if you are out there , to come home where you belong			0
we love you and we miss you			0
we want to see your smile again , we want to hear you sing again , to see you cuddle @entity181 , or sit at the piano			0
we want to be a family again			0

@entity2 chief @entity1 will be questioned by mps
