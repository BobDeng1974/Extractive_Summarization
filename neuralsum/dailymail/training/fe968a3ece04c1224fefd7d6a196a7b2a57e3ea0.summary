by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 08:52 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 - wannabe @entity1 has been attacking other women			2
the outspoken blonde - who appeared on @entity5 in 2006 - slammed @entity6 for being ' a chubster ' , and criticised working mothers who are physically larger than a size eight			2
speaking to closer magazine , the mother - of - three , 38 , who claims to be a size eight herself , said : ' all working mums could be a size eight like me if they put in a bit of effort			2
it ’s not that hard ! ' i believe in " eat less , move more "			2
there are loads of celebrities who need to try harder too			0
take @entity6 for example … @entity6 is quite a chubster			0
she could work harder for her body			0
' @entity1 with her three children @entity27 , 7 , @entity28 , 3 , and @entity29 , 6 , standing on sofa , says working mothers bigger than a size 8 are ' just lazy ' @entity1 called model @entity6 , pictured , a ' chubster ' the former reality tv contestant enjoys stirring trouble			1
she once remarked that she could never love a ginger child , and she came to blows with usually unflappable @entity39 presenter @entity38 earlier this month after saying she judged children based on their names , and would n't like her own children - @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity28 - playing with youngsters named @entity44 or @entity45			1
she said : ' i think you can tell a great deal from a name			0
for me , there 's certain names that i hear and i think " urgh "			1
' for me , a name is a shortcut of finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask : " do i want my children to play with them ? " ' when i hear screeched across the playground : " @entity44 ! come back ' ere			1
" it 's the @entity61 , the @entity63 the @entity62 , the @entity64			0
' mother - of - three @entity1 appeared on @entity65 recently to say she judges children based on what their names are @entity38 and @entity69 presenting @entity65 's @entity39 when @entity1 appeared to say she judged parents for giving children names like @entity44 and @entity45 she added : ' there 's a whole set of things that go with children like that , who are quite a disruptive influence in ' chool and that 's why i do n't like those kind of children			1
' i tend to think that children who have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they make much better playdates for my children			1
' we are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions			0
’ miss @entity38 , 32 , was flabbergasted , responding : ' listen to what you are saying			0
