the average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing , scientists have claimed			1
in research looking back over iq tests from the past few decades , they found that the tests were becoming harder - but people were still doing just as well			1
but the reasons why people are becoming smarter is not known - with theories including better education and improved medical care			1
researchers at @entity13 looked at scores over 64 years			1
in total , more than 200,000 participants in iq tests were studied			1
since 1950 , average intelligence was found to have risen by about 20 iq points			1
explanations include better education ( stock image shown ) and improved medical care the research , titled a @entity22 of @entity23 and reported by @entity24 for the @entity25 , was published in the journal intelligence			1
carried out by @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 from @entity13 , they looked specifically at the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			2
poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two , a separate study in december 2014 found - and its impact increases as the child ages			2
deprived young children were found to have iq scores six points lower , on average , than children from wealthier families			1
and the gap got wider throughout childhood , with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence			0
scientists from @entity49 , @entity50 compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the @entity55 ( teds )			0
the study is an on - going investigation socio - economic and genetic links to intelligence			0
this tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence			2
in total , more than 200,000 participants from 48 countries over 64 years were studied in the research			1
since 1950 , it was found that the average intelligence had risen by the equivalent of 20 iq points			1
' rpm is a valid and reliable measure of general iq , dr @entity28 told @entity76			0
' also , it is cultural - free test so that it has been widely used for nearly 80 years			0
' ‘ iq tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100 , so this is a significant jump , ’ the @entity25 reported			1
the research builds on earlier evidence from philosopher and psychologist @entity85 , from the @entity86 in @entity87			0
he had noticed that iq tests were getting harder , but people were still getting similar scores on them - which became known as the @entity93			2
this graph shows how the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) scores have been increasing over time			0
@entity23 is seen as an accurate way of measuring intelligence , and ' it is cultural - free test so that has been widely used for nearly 80 years , ' dr @entity28 told @entity76 the research was carried out by scientists from @entity13			2
they looked specifically at the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) - an example is shown			0
this tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence apparently , if modern @entity111 took a test from a century ago , they would get a relatively high average iq score of 130 ; vice versa , and our ancestors would score a measly average of 70			2
this equates to a three - point rise in @entity75 per decade			0
according to the new study , though , outside of the @entity111 the biggest change was clearly in developing countries , @entity75 was ‘ catching up with the developed world ’			0
‘ there are multiple possible reasons proposed for this phenomenon , ’ they write			0
these include improved education , increased exposure to testing , improved medical care and nutritition and decreased family size			1
perhaps most importantly , though , is that the instance of @entity75 increasing was not just true in general for the world as a whole - but could also be noticed on a much smaller scale			0
‘ the @entity85 effect is strong enough to be showed in even small and non-representative samples as well as in the very young and older adults , ’ the researchers conclude .			0
