it has been revealed over the past two days that @entity2 gunman @entity1 was a career criminal and drug addict , but it seems that was not the case just a few short years ago			2
in his high school yearbook photo from 2000 , taken while he was a senior at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , the teenager is seen smiling and happy			1
in fact , it seems he was both personable and popular judging but what his fellow students said about the young man			1
' he loves to laugh , and his smile wins over the girls			1
' they then added , ' he will go far in life			1
' @entity1 did not go far however , and shortly after graduating was arrested for the first time , convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving at the age of 19 in 2001			2
from there , numerous drug arrests followed , as well as ones for robbery and a weapons charge			0
soon he was homeless , living in shelters , and he eventually converted to @entity45			0
not far : a little over 10 years after he was described as smiling and personable , @entity1 killed a man and opened fire on @entity48 even then , with the religion 's strict stance on drugs , he would continue to fall back into his addictions , so bad that in 2011 he actually begged a judge to put him in jail so he could kick crack and become clean			2
soon , his mosque even asked him to leave , after he began sleeping there without permission			0
then , on wednesday , the 32 - year - old killed a young solider , corporal @entity60 , as he stood guard at the @entity62 , before opening fire on @entity48			0
he injured three more before he was eventually shot dead .			0

@entity65 seems like a much different man based on *quotes* from his friends in his high school yearbook
while a senior at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , he was a ' *ladies* man ' who ' loved to laugh '
one friend even commented that ' he would go far in life '
