my daughters had told me the hotel was a favourite of @entity4 so i thought it would be big , brash and boastful ... and it was			0
but @entity12 the @entity7 - which sits at atop the world 's largest artificial islands created in the shape of a palm tree - is also beautiful , and that is not what i had expected			1
the @entity16 resort , which opened in 2008 , was clearly designed by someone who loves the sea and tales of the lost city			1
scroll down to watch the journalist 's video @entity12 was clearly designed by someone who loves the sea and tales of the lost city every column , ceiling , painting and even door handle has been carefully crafted to remind the visitor that sea - life is central to its operation			1
the complex is big , very big			0
ever visited the @entity33 ? the @entity12 has its own version inside the hotel , but with 11 million litres and 65,000 marine animals it 's more than five times as large			1
at @entity12 we stayed in an executive suite , but for visitors who ca n't get enough of watching marine life , the underwater suites feature floor to ceiling views of the aquarium			1
you can watch the sharks , piranhas and sea horses as you soak in your bath or even from the comfort of your bed			0
for visitors who ca n't get enough of watching marine life , the underwater suites feature floor to ceiling views of the aquarium			2
you can watch the fish as you recline in your bath or even from the comfort of your bed the @entity16 resort , which opened in 2008 , is a favourite of @entity4 and her mother @entity63 @entity65 at £ 6,000 a night these are aimed at honeymooners , however , i suspect most honeymooners will be otherwise engaged to appreciate the view			1
but as a keen fisherman seeing all those wonderful creatures must have triggered some primeval and we dined on seafood all week			2
deciding which restaurant to visit at @entity12 was never an easy decision , but with such a wide range of culinary delights it was a dilemma that we enjoyed - the only problem was remembering the location of a particular restaurant because the hotel was so vast			1
a favourite was the hotel 's award - winning seafood restaurant , @entity87 and as expected , the food and service was superb			0
the restaurant has a floor to ceiling glass wall and the view of the aquarium was simply mesmerizing - conversation consisted of ' wow , look at the colours on that one ' or ' i have never seen a creature like that '			0
@entity99 and his wife enjoy dinner at the hotel 's award - winning seafood restaurant , @entity87 the hotel is a 20 - minute car ride from the city centre , but to ensure that you do n't feel like straying , the hotel has 21 restaurants , bars and lounges to entertain its guests			2
during our exploration we managed to sneak a look at the 924 square - metre @entity115 , where @entity4 and her friends stayed in november			0
pictured : a close - up view from the table at dinner located on top of the hotel , the three bedroom pad can be yours for around £ 28,000 per night - which by my rough reckoning equates to more than 30 pence per second - and a private lift takes you up the 22 floors			0
you can eat haute cuisine on a gold leaf dining table , cooked by your own personal chef , surrounded by expensive works of art while enjoying panoramic views of the @entity137			0
we spent the week living like children - we fed the stingrays , sped across the estate on a zipwire and embarked on a shark safari which saw us putting on suits and helmets and wandering around a tank with the beasts			0
but even if we had n't booked up for all of that , we would have been quite content with the time we spent in @entity12 ' own water - park , @entity150 , which at 17 hectares , is @entity16 's largest			1
one ride , @entity152 , has a near - vertical 27 metres drop which propelled me through an acrylic tube with sharks just inches away - a truly thrilling experience			0
it was impressive to see the emphasis on safety - every few metres life - guards were on patrol and one - thousand staff are employed at the waterpark			0
the hotel also has several conventional swimming pools for guests			0
a minor gripe was that it did n't have one where i could simply swim lengths without knocking into less able swimmers			0
when i decided to venture into the sea surrounding the @entity12 it only took one shout of ' watch out sir , @entity176 ' , before my question of why no - one was swimming in the sea was answered			2
with paparazzi following not far behind , @entity4 arrives at @entity12 during her stay in 2011 one ride , @entity152 , has a near - vertical 27 metres drop which propels the user through an acrylic tube with sharks just inches away - a truly thrilling experience the view from the @entity190 - entry costs £ 16 and from the viewing platform on the 124th floor you can get an idea of the scale of @entity16 's developing landscape during our five - day stay we only ventured out once and that was to visit the @entity190 , the world 's tallest skyscraper , a must - see for any visitor to @entity16			1
entry costs £ 16 and from the viewing platform on the 124th floor you can get an idea of the scale of @entity16 's developing landscape			1
it 's located in the @entity205 , the world 's largest shopping centre			1
after five days in the @entity12 i still felt there were parts we had n't explored - it was tough to fit them in around the massages , eating , swimming and sunbathing			2
but i think that is where the beauty of the hotel lies - you get so lost in exploring the mini city of luxury that is presented to you , that you take some time out from the real world - and that is what holidays are all about are n't they ? a stay at the @entity7 ( www.atlantisthepalm.com ) starts from £ 364 per night based on two adults and two children sharing a @entity229			1
includes unlimited access to @entity231 , with new record - breaking rides and slides and unlimited access to the underwater world of @entity236 , home to 65,000 marine animals .			2
