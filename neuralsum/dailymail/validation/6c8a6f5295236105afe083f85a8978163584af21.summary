the challenges of taking a penalty in football are so well documented - a baying crowd , pressurised responsibility and psychological isolation - it 's no wonder that most clubs tend to dedicate time on the training ground to how to deal with them			1
@entity11 third division side @entity10 have decided to try out a rather strange technique to practice their spot - kicks			0
players were tasked with scoring from 12 yards after having spun their entire body around 20 times			1
players were made to spin around 20 times before taking their shots from 12 yards the unique penalty practice resulted in several hilarious failed attempts as players fell to the ground the rationale behind this exercise is unclear , but one could assume that if a player can take a penalty while dizzy , then he can probably manage it in a game			2
right ? what followed was hilarious			0
unsurprisingly , a number of @entity10 players failed to score with their attempts and some even to make contact with the ball , instead landing bottoms up on the turf			2
this player does n't even make contact with the ball before he goes crashing into the turf after falling over twice more , he eventually manages to get his shot away and scores in the open goal the challenges of taking a penalty are difficult enough without having to be dizzy as well			0

taking a penalty is one of the hardest things to do in football
it 's even harder if you *'ve* spun around 20 times before you kick the ball
@entity10 players were tasked with doing exactly that in training
