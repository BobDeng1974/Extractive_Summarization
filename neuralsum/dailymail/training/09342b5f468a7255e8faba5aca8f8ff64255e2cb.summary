by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 22 march 2013 a budget black hole of £ 23billion could lead to future tax rises of £ 480 for every family after the general election			1
the @entity5 warned the next government will have to find the money in the two years after the election if it is to get public finances back on track			1
if ministers keep cutting spending at the current rate , £ 9billion of tax rises would be necessary in 2016/17 – the equivalent of an increase of 3p on the basic rate of income tax			1
but this week ’s @entity40 also slapped £ 3.5billion of extra costs on government departments who will have to pay higher national insurance contributions as a result of reforms to pensions			2
that will raise the likely tax hit to £ 12.5billion			1
the @entity50 claims the government would like to make austerity savings using spending cuts alone			2
but that would mean @entity56 departments enduring unprecedented cuts of 18 per cent by 2017/18			0
and the @entity60 ’ , which spells out all the chancellor ’s budget measures , actually reveals that officials are already considering tax rises			1
@entity21 today met @entity63 and @entity64 who have recently bought an apartment to promote his home buyers schemes hard hats on : a day after delivering his budget , chancellor @entity21 ( left ) refused to rule out allowing people buying second homes to benefit from a £ 130billion government scheme , while deputy pm @entity74 ( left ) came under fire on @entity76 for the government 's family policy hitting stay at home mothers @entity21 announced the spending review planned for this summer will have to find another £ 11.5billion in cuts for 2015 - 16			1
the @entity50 refused to say where the axe will fall , but the @entity84 think tank said calculated that with £ 8.5billion coming from departments , if it was spread evenly the reductions would be : @entity88 , @entity89 , said : ' if these cuts go ahead , it means a major further reductions in spending on housing , further and higher education , early years and other local government services			0
' ‘ it would , of course , be possible to do more of this further consolidation through tax instead , ’ the document says			1
@entity5 director , @entity101 , said that suggests tax rises are on the cards after the next election , whoever wins in 2015			1
he said : ‘ it seems extremely hard to imagine we will really achieve an additional £ 23 billion of spending cuts by 2017/18			0
as the @entity60 almost acknowledges , it seems likely there will be some significant tax increases to offset some of those cuts			1
’ the @entity5 called the state of the public finances ‘ desperately disappointing ’ , with the chancellor due to borrow £ 70billion more in 2014/15 than he had originally hoped			1
mr @entity101 warned that the poor state of the public finances also means a ‘ grim ’ future for departments whose budgets will not be protected			1
the government has ringfenced spending in the @entity125 , international aid and schools			0
mr @entity101 said : ‘ add to that the fact that we are promised more capital spending , more spending on social care and a more generous childcare subsidy , within an overall spending envelope that has not been expanded , and the outlook for all other unprotected spending looks grim indeed			0
’ the warning came as the @entity84 , a centre left think tank , warned that belt - tightening is set to hit the @entity142 hard			1
chancellor @entity21 today promoted his house bying package on a visit to a @entity148 @entity147 development in @entity149 , south east @entity150 chirpy : @entity21 admitted it was yet another tough budget but said if you look around @entity156 @entity155 's economic problems are n't that bad @entity74 was confronted during his @entity76 phone - in which he co-presents with @entity159 the @entity161 ’s spending review , which will draw up budgets for 2015/16 over the next few months , looks set to demand cuts of £ 1.65billion from the @entity164			1
local government also faces a £ 1.5billion cut , with £ 930 being slashed from the @entity168 budget , £ 850million from the non-schools parts of the education budget , £ 500million from the @entity171 and £ 460million slashed from the @entity172			1
that will annoy senior members of the @entity175 – home secretary @entity176 , business secretary @entity177 , defence secretary @entity178 and local government secretary @entity179 – who have been dubbed the @entity180 for protesting that they ca n’t make more cuts			0
new parents @entity183 and his wife @entity185 ( left ) , who together earn more than £ 90,000 , have welcomed the new child care tax break which they will get while @entity188 ( right ) who earns £ 50,000 believes he and his wife @entity189 , a stay at home mother - of - two , have been penalised by losing their child benefit for having ' traditional @entity195 values ' awkward : @entity21 bumped into his @entity30 rival @entity197 outside tv studios in @entity199 as they both took to the airwaves to give their take on the budget a defiant mr @entity21 said he would make no apology for cutting spending yesterday after he was accused of ‘ massaging ’ the figures on borrowing to score a political point			1
the @entity5 said his manipulation of the borrowing figures could lead to ‘ real economic costs ’			1
@entity30 also seized on revelations that £ 2.2billion was trimmed from the @entity125 budget at the last minute – money which could have been spent on frontline care or hiring nurses			0
a @entity216 survey for which ? found huge support for many of the flagship policies unveiled in the budget which party do you trust with the economy ? @entity21 has declared he is in competition with shadow chancellor @entity197 over who can get the most followers on @entity228			2
a day after joining the site , using the @entity228 handle @ @entity21 , the chancellor had racked up 33,400 followers despite sending just three tweets			2
@entity197 has sent more than 3,000 tweets and has 77,500 followers			0
‘ we 're in a competition now , ’ mr @entity21 told @entity236 's @entity235 this morning			0
making his debut on @entity228 yesterday he was deluged with advice - and abuse			2
it included missives such as : ‘ learn to punctuate correctly you risible t * * t ’			0
another example of taunting was : ‘ you ’re a first class b * * * * * d , you overpaid , overeducated fox hunting t * * t. ’ mr @entity21 admitted : ' it 's a fast and furious world out there			0
’ but mr @entity21 rejected the criticism , saying he was proud to have got spending under control			0
‘ we have been very , very tough and we have reduced spending in order to reduce borrowing , ’ he said			2
‘ so if the charge is , you stepped in to stop government spending too much at the end of the financial year , that ’s right			0
’ the problem arose in february when mr @entity21 was warned by the @entity266 that income tax receipts were £ 5.1billion lower than expected			2
that triggered a period of frantic horse - trading in which the @entity50 leaned on other departments to underspend their budgets			2
figures , never published before , showed that £ 3billion was also found from the defence budget and £ 900million from @entity275			0
other money was saved by delaying payments to bodies like the @entity279 and the @entity280			2
the exercise opened up mr @entity21 to the charge that he has fiddled the figures , using the kind of accounting tricks for which @entity286 was once notorious			0
the @entity5 was damning about that exercise , effectively accusing ministers of wastefully manipulating spending plans for political ends			1
crisis : @entity293 leaders are trying to secure a bailout for their near - bankrupt nation which has left people in the country desperate to get their cash from closed banks there was a rare piece of good news for the economy yesterday as figures showed a fall in government borrowing , a rise in @entity309 sales and growing business confidence			1
it came a day after official growth forecasts for 2013 were slashed in half to 0.6 per cent			0
the government borrowed £ 2.8billion last month – £ 9billion less than in february last year			0
retail sales jumped 2.1 per cent last month , the biggest rise since march last year			0
and a @entity318 survey showed @entity155 manufacturers at their most confident for a year .			0

chancellor points to bankrupt @entity293 as a sign of how bad things could be
but he admits delaying paying bills to meet promise to cut borrowing
row erupts state - backed *mortgages* being used to buy second homes
