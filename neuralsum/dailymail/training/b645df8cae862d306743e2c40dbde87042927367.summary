the city of @entity1 has come out against the family of a 12 - year - old boy who was killed at the hands of a police officer			1
@entity6 was shot dead by an officer just two seconds after the cop encountered the boy , who was holding a gun , playing in a park with his sister on november 22			1
the initial call of complaint came from someone who told the dispatcher the gun was ' probably fake ' and the gun ultimately turned out to be a non-lethal pellet gun			0
his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and now the city has responded by saying the young boy failed ' to exercise due care to avoid injury			1
' the defendant is police officer @entity36			2
also named as a plantiff in the family 's suit in @entity6 's sister @entity50 , 14 , who was tackled by an officer as she ran towards the body of her brother screaming ' my baby brother , they killed my baby brother			1
' the officers then handcuffed the young girl and threw her in the back of a squad car			0
at no point was @entity6 given medical attention until an @entity64 agent on a nearby bank detail arrived , almost five minutes after the shooting			0
the entire incident , from the moment police arrive on the scene to when @entity50 is taken down and handcuffed to the arrival of the agent who provided first aid , was caught on video which the city was initially reluctant to release it to the public			0
@entity6 's family ( above ) filed a wrongful death lawsuit in january a police union official at the time said the officers thought the gun was real and that they did n't know @entity6 , who was 5 ' 7 " and weighed 195lbs , was so young			1
police were also not told that the call of complaint came from someone who told the dispatcher @entity6 was a child and that the gun he had was ' probably fake			0
' the city in their filing also claimed to have no knowledge of @entity36 's checkered pass and reports he had used excessive force numerous times in the past			0
despite the city 's response , the family 's attorney , @entity98 , said on friday ; ' i do believe that a 12 - year - old child died unnecessarily at the hands of @entity1 police officers and i do believe that certain officers should n't have been entitled to wear the uniform			2
