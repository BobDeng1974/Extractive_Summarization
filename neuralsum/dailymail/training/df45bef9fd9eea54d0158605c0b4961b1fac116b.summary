these kind - hearted divers removed a fishing hook from the jaws of a 6ft silky shark after coaxing it into a natural trance			1
friends @entity7 , 26 , and @entity8 , 25 , grabbed the fish by the tail and twisted it upside down , paralysing it in a state called tonic immobility			1
it is a well - known phenomenon that affects certain shark species , including @entity15 and tiger sharks , and can last for up to 15 minutes			2
although twisting the animals upside down puts them in a state called tonic immobility , this one quickly awoke and swam away but when the pair - who nickname themselves @entity42 - removed the hook with a pair of pliers , it was enough to stir the animal rapidly back into life as it darted away			2
the friends see anywhere from five to 20 sharks on each dive off the coast of @entity53 , @entity21 , and say three - quarters of them have hooks embedded somewhere in their bodies			1
fishermen often target silky sharks , which are numerous off the southeastern @entity59 coast and in the @entity60			1
but they can also be caught accidentally by people trying to catch other species such as tuna			0
mr @entity7 said : ' it happens when people who are fishing			1
they catch them and cut the line so they do n't have to bring it on the boat , or the shark breaks the line			0
tough job : the pair use pliers to extract the hooks , which they say affect three - quarters of the sharks they see technique : the sharks are flipped upside down by holding them gently by the tail and twisting their bodies flipped : once the sharks are the wrong way up , they are paralysed for up to 15 minutes			1
scientists disagree over the origins of the phenomenon , which affects several species and can be triggered in different ways ' taking a hook out feels great , knowing you have helped one of these magnificent creatures makes it all worth it			0
' the @entity42 said they had made it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths , noses and bodies of every shark they can			0
' i love popping the hooks out , ' said mr @entity7			2
' there is some danger there but the last thing i 'm thinking about it getting bitten - i just want to get the hook out			1
' we love sharks so much and want to be around them as much as possible			0
we are trying to changes people 's perspective on sharks through the videos that @entity8 films			2
' we want to help protect our oceans and marine life			0
' animal kingdom : the pair love sharks and despite silky sharks growing up to 10ft , they rarely feel in danger despite publicity , shark attacks are relatively extremely rare			1
mr @entity7 said : ' we are trying to changes people 's perspective on sharks through our videos			2
we want to help protect our oceans and marine life ' the friends hope to turn their passion into a business and teach others about the importance of caring for sharks			0
@entity145 sharks are common near the coasts of the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
they can live for more than 20 years and grow up to 10ft long , and although their size and jaws make them potentially dangerous to humans , attacks are fairly rare .			0

@entity7 , 26 , and @entity8 , 25 , often dive near @entity53 , @entity21
they say three - quarters of sharks they find have fishing hooks in them
so they turn silky sharks upside down by tail , *temporarily* paralysing them
' there is danger there but the last thing i 'm thinking about it getting bitten '
