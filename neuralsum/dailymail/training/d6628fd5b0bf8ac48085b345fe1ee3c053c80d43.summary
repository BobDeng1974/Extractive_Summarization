by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 6 august 2012 sixteen @entity2 soldiers have died after suspected @entity4 militants attacked a checkpoint on the @entity7 - @entity2 border on sunday evening			1
the gunmen stole two of their vehicles before detonating one to blow a hole through a security fence into @entity7 , the country 's chief military spokesman said today			0
both @entity2 and @entity7 blamed the bloody onslaught on extremists from the @entity19 - run @entity17 and @entity2 's @entity20			1
the @entity7 intelligence services claim they were able to thwart the assault after receiving advance reports of an impending attack from the @entity20			1
however , the incident has raised fresh fears in @entity7 about the @entity2 government 's ability to reassert control over the lawless @entity20 region			1
the border had been largely quiet in the three decades since @entity7 and @entity2 signed a peace agreement , but @entity20 turned increasingly chaotic after @entity2 's longtime president @entity52 was toppled last year			1
militants have taken advantage of the security vacuum that followed @entity52 's ousting and have attacked @entity7 from the desert peninsula three times over the past year , including a cross-border assault that killed eight people last august			2
@entity7 contends that @entity62 operatives have infiltrated the area , as well as @entity65 militants who have crossed over from @entity17			2
the country is building a fence along the border with @entity2 to avert attacks and block the entry of illegal @entity72 migrants			0
wounded : an @entity2 soldier lies on a hospital bed in @entity30 , in @entity2 's northern @entity20 inferno : a picture released by the @entity7 army shows a vehicle burning near the @entity80 border crossing after the gunmen attacked caution : roads were closed all night as @entity7 remained on high alert after what it said was a thwarted terror attack @entity2 's new president @entity86 accused the militants of ' treason ' and said they would ' pay dearly ' for sunday 's attack , which the @entity7 military said was part of a plot to abduct an @entity7 soldier			1
@entity7 defense minister @entity94 demanded that @entity2 do more to enforce security and prevent attacks from @entity20			1
' we hope this will be a fitting wakeup call for the @entity2 to take things in hand on their side more forcefully , ' he told the @entity7 parliament 's foreign affairs and defence committee today			2
- gen. @entity107 told @entity108 that the militants attacked the @entity2 troops at a border checkpoint , seized a truck and an armoured car , then blew up one of the vehicles to punch a hole through a security fence to enter @entity7			1
he said @entity7 intelligence services had received information about an impending infiltration and sent aircraft to strike at the second car the militants seized from the @entity2 forces			1
' we were prepared for it , so there was a hit , ' he said			0
under guard : @entity65 security men patrol the smuggling tunnels which link @entity2 and the @entity17 armed : a @entity19 guard surveys the tunnel near the border town of @entity25 @entity94 said eight militants were killed by @entity7 forces who struck from the air , as well as with tanks and artillery			1
the gunmen were armed with explosive devices , submachine guns and grenades , said @entity107 , who claimed the military ' averted a major attack on southern @entity7			0
' there were no casualties among @entity7 civilians			0
people living in the immediate area were ordered to remain in their homes while troops searched for other militants who might have remained behind , but were told this morning that they could resume their routines			0
an @entity2 military official said last night that @entity2 troops were pursuing militants who returned to @entity2			2
@entity2 - @entity7 relations have always been cool , but since @entity52 was overthrown and @entity4 parties moved to the forefront of the @entity2 political scene , @entity7 officials have expressed concern that ties would deterioriate further			2
sunday 's attack took place around sunset near the @entity2 border town of @entity25 , when the troops at the checkpoint were having the traditional meal at the end of the daily fast during the @entity175 holy month of @entity176			1
immediately afterwards , @entity2 shut the @entity25 crossing with @entity17 , an ominous sign for the @entity65 territory 's 1.6 million people			2
@entity7 , fearing militant attacks , bars @entity182 from entering @entity7 , so the @entity25 crossing - the only passage from @entity17 that is not under direct @entity7 control - is their only gateway to the outside world			2
leaky border : tents cover the entrances of tunnels used for smuggling along the @entity17 - @entity2 border @entity17 's deputy prime minister , @entity195 of the ruling @entity19 movement , said militants from the territory were ' not involved in this awful crime			1
' but a leading @entity19 member , @entity200 , undercut that denial , telling @entity202 that he had asked @entity2 to provide the names of possible suspects from @entity17 so that ' we will immediately bring them to justice			0
' the attack could harm @entity19 's efforts to persuade @entity86 to ease restrictions at the crossing			0
@entity19 is an offshoot of the @entity212 and had hoped that @entity86 , a fellow member of the region - wide movement , would be sympathetic to its requests			0
but he has moved cautiously , in part because of concerns about an influx of militants from @entity17			0
a senior @entity19 official in @entity17 confirmed that @entity175 extremists with links to global jihadist groups are present in @entity17			0
their numbers are small and they are tightly controlled by @entity19 security , the official claimed , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters			0
@entity86 convened an emergency meeting with military and security leaders following the attack , and in an interview afterward with @entity2 state tv , declared that ' this treason , this aggression and criminality can not be appeased			0
troops will totally control @entity20			0
' in a statement late last night , @entity86 's @entity212 urged @entity2 authorities to take all necessary measures to ' confront this serious challenge to @entity2 sovereignty and to protect @entity20 from all armed groups			2
' since @entity52 stepped down , @entity7 has allowed @entity2 to send in more troops to @entity20 , which has been mostly demilitarized according to the 1979 peace deal between the two countries			1
sunday 's attack sparked renewed calls in @entity2 to amend the treaty to allow for more troops in @entity20			1
