click here for all the @entity1 and facts from the quarter - final using our match zone service at the end the @entity6 in @entity7 resounded with the sounds of the 20,000 @entity11 fans goading their hosts with a chant to the tune of @entity15 as they waved their shirts above their head			1
it is an involved song , explaining how the @entity19 have been crying ever since @entity20 scored against them in 1990 and how @entity21 is better than @entity22			2
‘ how does it feel ? ’ they sang ‘ to be bossed about in your own backyard			2
’ it has become the anthem of this @entity28 , heard everywhere @entity11 gather , which is pretty much everywhere			0
manager : @entity75 8 @entity48 : @entity76 7 , @entity77 6 , @entity78 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity79 7 , @entity80 6 , @entity81 5 , @entity82 5 ( @entity83 60 5 ) , @entity84 5 ( @entity85 75 5 ) , @entity86 4 ( @entity87 59 6 )			1
subs : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			0
manager : @entity98 6 booked : hazard			0
referee : @entity100 ( @entity101 ) 7 and it feels particularly appropriate at the moment			0
@entity31 have a rag - tag army of fans , sleeping in cars and colonising cities and stadia as they journey around this country			1
but they are led by the @entity28 ’s last superstar , @entity50 , and they look increasingly as though they are heading for the @entity112 next sunday afternoon			1
@entity19 might meet them there , but they are shorn of @entity116 and an awful realisation is dawning on the hosts : a new nightmare of the @entity112 might be looming , with @entity31 beating them in their very own final			1
and that would surely be worse than their original nightmare , the @entity126 , when @entity127 beat them to win the 1950 @entity28 @entity50 undid @entity48 with an inspired first - half performance on saturday , the best @entity31 have produced so far at this @entity28 , with excellent supporting roles from @entity34 and @entity58 , whose introduction brought better balance to the team			1
on the debit side , they may miss @entity136 , who limped off with a thigh injury after 33 minutes , for the semi final			0
it was not an overwhelming performance			0
@entity48 , whilst more direct and physical than inspirational , never allowed them the comfort of running away with the game and right to the end when @entity87 drove in a cross and @entity148 shot over , they made it a nervous affair			1
nearly two : @entity50 was so close to doubling @entity31 's lead with a free - kick in the first half painful : @entity154 goes down injured in front of @entity31 coach @entity75 protection , referee ? @entity50 pleads for a foul on the ground during the quarter - final scuffle : the @entity163 referee has a word with @entity47 over an on - pitch incident yet @entity31 are in their first @entity28 semi-final since 1990 and coming into form			1
principally , one man increasingly looks ready to make this @entity28 his own			0
‘ @entity50 played a wonderful match , ’ said his coach @entity75			1
‘ every move he makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers his opponents , which is what he does beyond scoring goals or not			2
' the influence he has is decisive ; the fact that he never loses the ball and always brings two or three opponents to him			0
he is water in the desert			0
today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath of fresh air			0
’ @entity98 , the @entity48 coach , was not in no mood to join any potential coronation , however			2
‘ we were not impressed by the @entity31 , absolutely not , ’ he said			2
‘ they ’re just an ordinary team			0
if i had played this way i would have been destroyed by @entity195 press			0
’ unlucky : @entity34 nearly doubled his advantage in the second half , but he hit the bar stunned : and his coach @entity75 fell to the ground after the incident celebration : the @entity31 fans , who had thousands of supporters in @entity19 , cheer with their fans he was right to point out that as the game wore on , @entity31 retreated and created little , a last - minute chance for @entity50 aside when @entity76 saved well			1
‘ they suffered and if we had equalised they were dead and buried , ’ said @entity98			0
but in reality , @entity31 should have had the game won by early in the second half			1
wilmots did concede that @entity50 was an ‘ extraordinary ’ player whilst also complaining he was offered too much protection from the referee			2
in truth , it was his first - half performance that decided the fate of this game			2
there was a moment on 28 minutes when @entity50 picked up the ball in his own half and spotted a way through a forest of midfielders and managed to cut the ball inside @entity47 a full 45 yards away and find @entity136			1
as it happened , @entity47 recovered brilliantly to block the shot but you had to pity the @entity234 captain			0
the angle accuracy of the pass was simply beyond that you would imagine was possible on a football pitch			0
jubilation : the @entity240 fall to the ground after securing the 1 - 0 victory agonising : @entity47 had a tough day against @entity31 's strikers guidance : @entity50 prays ahead of the crucial game in @entity7 on saturday tough : @entity80 and @entity246 try to tackle @entity34 at times in that first half @entity50 seemed almost to be goading the @entity195 into tackling him , lingering on the ball and turning away at the last moment			1
the match was only eight minutes old when he made his impact , turning away from one challenge only to find @entity80 pressing him			0
shielding the ball , he simply turned in the opposite direction and played in @entity59			0
the winger ’s cross deflected off a defender and sat up nicely on the half volley for @entity34 , who has endured a torrent of criticism in his home country for his performances thus far			1
this time though he connected beautifully , sweeping it into the far corner from 20 yards out			0
but @entity48 edged their way back into the game			1
@entity154 ’s powerful strike was parried away by @entity53 and @entity82 headed just wide from an excellent @entity271 cross on 52 minutes @entity34 unleashed a shot which was deflected wide by @entity246 while @entity84 was lucky to stay on the pitch when he raised his studs on to the shin of @entity58 on 53 minutes			1
@entity31 had a chance to take complete control of the game on 55 minutes			1
@entity34 pushed the ball through the legs of @entity281 to create a clear strike on goal but lifted his shot over @entity76 and on to the bar			1
wilmots brought on @entity87 for @entity287 and eventually took of the disappointing hazard , opting to send long balls towards @entity87 , @entity80 and @entity290			2
they worried @entity31 in their best moments , but the @entity240 never looked out of control			2
finally they are past he quarter finals , a stage they could never seem to get beyond			2
having done so , perhaps they will be freed to deliver the trophy they crave .			0

@entity34 nets early opener in @entity7 , volleying past @entity76
@entity50 stars in the game , but did n't add to four *tournament* goals
@entity31 will play @entity306 or @entity307 in the semi-finals
@entity34 hit the bar in the second half , @entity50 missed one on one
@entity84 was disappointing for @entity48 , and was substituted
