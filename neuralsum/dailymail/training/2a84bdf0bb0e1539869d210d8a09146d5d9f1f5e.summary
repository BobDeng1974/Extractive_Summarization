@entity1 manager @entity0 believes his summer signings are finally emerging from an adaptation period and showing signs they can be a success at the club			1
forward @entity7 was first to shine with a number of impressive cameos , culminating in the 20 - year - old 's maiden league goal since a £ 20million move from @entity13 against @entity14 last weekend			1
@entity15 , whose disappointing first half of the season was disrupted by injury , has found a position for himself on the right side of a back three but has shown his versatility with occasional roles in midfield			1
@entity7 ( left ) is put through his paces by @entity1 head of fitness @entity26 on thursday @entity7 has impressed in recent weeks for @entity1 after a slow starting following his £ 20m move @entity7 ( centre ) scored his first league goal for @entity1 in the 1 - 0 win over @entity14 the @entity33 , who turned 21 this week , is a product of @entity37 's youth system and arrived in a £ 10m deal with high expectations after one season at @entity41			1
@entity0 believes keen @entity1 watchers are only now starting to see his potential			1
' he will need a bit of time moving to a new country as a young player , ' said @entity0			1
' you have to remember he had only one full year of playing even though he had come through the system at @entity37			0
' i think he has shown his value and i think there is no doubt he will prove to be a real bargain for us			0
' it was a lot of money for a young player but he is a wonderful talent , great footballer , his stature and power is well suited to the @entity63 , he is two - footed , has great balance and good aggression in his game and for me is multi-functional			0
' he will prove to be a player who can play in a number of positions very well here and as you have seen since he came in here he has been outstanding			0
@entity15 ( left ) holds off @entity73 as @entity1 train on thursday @entity0 has backed can ( right ) to be a success at @entity1 can showed his versatility against @entity14 , filling in in three position for @entity1 twitter account @ @entity80 posted a picture of a flag of @entity83 ' he actually played in three positions against @entity14 : he started on the right side of a back three , we moved him up to play in the top of the midfield box and then put him back into a wide midfield role			1
' it was one of the reasons we brought him here			0
he is a footballer and sometimes you find the very best footballers can play in any position and they are capable of working the game out			0
' versatility is often more of a curse than a blessing , as team - mate @entity99 discovered in 2011 when he arrived from @entity14 as a 21 - year - old with a £ 16m price tag to justify			1
however , @entity15 believes in his case it will prove to be a blessing			2
' it has always been the case that i have played in different positions , ' he told liverpoolfc.com			0
' it 's an advantage for the team to have a player like that and it 's an advantage for me personally as well			0
' my favourite position is central midfield and the manager knows that but if i get a chance to play and help the team i will happily play at the back			2
' i think i 've performed well and shown what i can do , but i need to keep on improving , and i hope i get a lot more games			0
' @entity0 spent £ 120m in the summer and most of his signings have come in for criticism in one form or another after failing to hit the ground running			1
@entity125 ( centre ) has come underfire for his performances since his £ 20m move from @entity129 @entity125 ( left ) is another player who @entity0 believes will come good in time for @entity1 @entity125 was brought in to be the new linchpin of the defence but struggled with the expectation on his shoulders and the 25 - year - old has been sidelined in recent weeks , but even he earned a vote of confidence from @entity0			1
' @entity125 will prove in his time he is as very good player , ' @entity0 added			1
' you have seen it over many years at the big clubs ; some players will settle in straight away and some take a bit of time			0
' he is still very young for a central defender but he will prove to be an outstanding player			2
' this whole year 's experience for him as a @entity1 player will benefit him and over the coming months and years he will show what a top player he is			2
' @entity1 , still short of goals , head on saturday to @entity154 who despite their apparent struggles have conceded just 23 goals in 21 matches and only 11 in 10 at home			2
@entity154 won 1 - 0 at @entity160 in september			0
' they are a tough team to break down			0
they may not have scored a lot of goals , which has been highlighted , but they do n't concede many either , ' said @entity0			1
' we had a difficult game against them earlier in the season where we conceded from a sloppy corner and just could n't make the breakthrough			0
' but we are on the back of four wins away from home and there is good momentum and confidence in the team			2
