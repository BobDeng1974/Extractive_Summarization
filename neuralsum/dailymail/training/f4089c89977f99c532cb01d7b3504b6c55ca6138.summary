a teenager has spoken of her ' total shock ' at being told at the age of 17 she had no vagina			2
@entity4 , 19 , has @entity5 , an rare syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb , cervix or vaginal opening			1
she was only diagnosed after she went to her gp about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she had n't started her periods			1
shock : @entity4 was told at the age of 17 she had no vagina			1
she was diagnosed with @entity5 , an unusual syndrome which affects the reproductive system - meaning she has no womb , cervix or vaginal opening tests revealed her condition and that where her vagina should be , there is simply an ident , or ' dimple ' - meaning she is unable to have sex or carry her own child			1
women with the condition appear completely normal externally - which means it is usually not discovered until a woman tries to have sex , or has not had her first period			1
miss @entity4 , from the @entity36 , admits when she was first diagnosed , she felt ' like a freak '			1
' i 'd never considered myself different from other women and the news was so shocking , i could n't believe what i was hearing			2
‘ i was sure the doctor had got it wrong , but when she explained that was why i was n’t having periods , it all started to make sense			1
‘ she then explained that i would never be able to carry a child and might have to have surgery before i could have sex			0
‘ i left the doctors in tears - i would never know what it was like to give birth , be pregnant , have a period			1
all the things i had imagined doing suddenly got erased from my future			0
' i was really angry and felt like i was n’t a real woman any more			0
' unaware : miss @entity4 explained she has a ' dimple ' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - hence why the condition was n't detected in her younger years unexpected : miss @entity4 was only diagnosed after she went to her gp about back pain - and mentioned in passing that she had n't started her periods			1
tests revealed her condition , which means she is unable to have sex or carry her own child because she had never attempted to have a physical relationship , miss @entity4 had never noticed the problem herself			1
had she tried , she would have discovered it was impossible for her to have sex			2
@entity5 ( @entity75 ) is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in the @entity78			1
it is characterised by the absence of the vagina , womb and cervix			1
women suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have periods or be able to conceive			1
the external genatalia are completely normal which is why @entity5 is n’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years			1
it ’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period			1
many women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment , which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the muscles			1
however , if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal			0
following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy			2
she said : ' it was n’t really a conscious decision not to have a boyfriend , i just did n’t really fancy any of the boys in my area , which is lucky , considering what i know now ’			0
@entity5 affects one in 5,000 women in the @entity78			1
most discover they have the condition because they have n't started their periods , but some find out when they struggle to have intercourse			1
miss @entity4 explained she has a ' dimple ' where her vagina should be so from the outside it looks normal - which explains why the condition was n't detected earlier			1
despite the shocking news , she is trying to see her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she meets the right man			1
she said : ' if he has a problem with it , then he ’s not the kind of guy i want to go out with			0
' i ’m a hopeless romantic and i see it as a great test of someone ’s character			0
instead of focusing on it putting off men , i actually think it will help me find , “ the one ”			0
' i want to be upfront with any men i meet and tell them straight away about my condition			0
i do n’t want them to feel tricked into being with me			0
‘ i will feel more comfortable if they know the truth and besides , if they run at the mention of @entity5 then i do n’t want to be intimate with them			2
' she says that as a teenager , she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen			2
' when i was 14 , my friends started talking to me about their periods			2
they started carrying tampons around , complaining about cramps and sharing notes on what it was like			0
‘ for a year i waited to go through the same , until at 15 , everyone i knew had started their period apart from me			2
despite the shocking news , she is trying to see her condition in a positive light - and even as a way of making sure she meets the right man			1
she said : ' if he has a problem with it , then he ’s not the kind of guy i want to see ' ‘ i did n’t panic though , i ’m tall and skinny and thought that might be something to do with me being a late developer			0
’ instead , she focused on her future and when she was 17 , applied to attend a music college in @entity182			0
but after suffering from pain in her neck in summer 2012 , she went to see her gp			0
' while i was there , i mentioned i had n’t started my period yet			2
i still was n’t overly worried but i thought it was worth saying something ‘ my doctor was very surprised but did n’t seem to think it was serious			0
he just suggested that he would do some scans to see what the problem was			0
' hindsight : miss @entity4 says that as a teenager , she was blissfully unaware of her condition - with no idea that the development she was waiting for would never happen women with @entity5 appear completely normal externally - which means it is often not discovered in childhood , but in the teenage years when scans showed nothing , she was referred to a gynaecologist , who immediately spotted something was wrong			1
miss @entity4 said : ‘ my other scan results had been sent to her and just from looking at them , she knew i had @entity5			1
‘ she sat me down and basically explained that i did n’t have a womb , or a vagina , that i was born without them and instead just had a small dimple in it ’s place			2
' so mortified by what she had heard , she was too embarrassed to admit to family and friends she had the condition - let alone the prospect of telling any future boyfriends			1
she said : ‘ i was too embarrassed to call my mum and talk it through with her , so instead , i sent her an email			0
@entity221 @entity4 help : miss @entity4 is now undergoing treatment to help her try and have intercourse in the future ' she called straight back and came over to @entity182 the next day from the @entity36			1
‘ although mum was upset for me , she tried to focus on finding out as much about the condition as possible , so we could understand it			0
‘ she also encouraged me to focus on the bright side			0
we laughed as we listed all the things i would n’t have to go through , period cramps , childbirth , smear tests - to try and look on the bright side			1
’ focusing on her treatment , miss @entity4 was admitted to the @entity236 and @entity237 in @entity238 , which specialises in the condition			1
there , she was given dilation treatment , which involved using different sized dilators to try and stretch her vaginal canal - but was told if it did n’t work , she would have to be operated on			1
honest : miss @entity4 says she now wants to speak out about her condition to raise awareness of it she said : ‘ i spent two days there , getting taught how to use the dilator and learning more about @entity5			1
‘ the first time the nurse showed me how to use a dilator i nearly died of embarrassment			0
but now i 've got used to it , i see it as any other form of treatment			0
‘ at the hospital , they referred me to a network of other women who have the same condition			2
it was great to speak to other girls who felt like me			0
‘ i stopped feeling so lonely and it also gave me hope as i spoke to women who had gone on to have a full sex life			2
’ thankfully , her treatment has worked and if she continues she will not need surgery and when she chooses to , will be able to have intercourse			0
further down the line there are more difficult conversations she will have to have to have when she wants to have children			0
she said : ‘ i ’m not at an age when i ’m thinking about kids , but i think that will hit me later on			0
i will use a surrogate , or adopt , but i will have to make sure any guy i meet is ok with that too			0
‘ again , i try and take it as a blessing that , unlike woman who discover they ca n’t conceive when they are already trying for a baby , i have time to get used to the idea			0
’ for @entity288 , her one hope is that the condition becomes more well known , so that other women realise they have it earlier than she did			2
‘ i had only told five of my best friends , but then i realised it ’s not something i should be ashamed of			0
‘ if i had cancer , or , any other medical issue , people would be supportive			0
so , i recently came out to everyone on @entity299 , telling them about my condition			2
‘ i was surprised at how positive everyone was , they said i was brave and beautiful , now i wish i had been open about it from the beginning			0
