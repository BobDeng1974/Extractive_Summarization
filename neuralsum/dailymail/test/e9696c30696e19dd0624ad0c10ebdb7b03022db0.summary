did you blink ? there was a total eclipse of the moon on saturday - but it was an unusually short one			1
the lunar event - where @entity7 's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes , making it the shortest eclipse of the century , @entity4 said			1
the so - called ' blood moon ' could be seen by billions of people across the western @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
the next one will be visible from @entity26			0
the best spot this morning was at the @entity29 , where spectators caught the entire five minutes of the orb around 5am @entity32 , astronomers said			0
sky - gazers in the @entity34 and @entity35 only caught part of the lunar show			0
the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on saturday night from eastern @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity40			0
but observatory staff in @entity42 were unable to see the eclipse due to cloudy weather and instead wrote on @entity45 : ' our live feed from the @entity48 [ in @entity49 ] is showing gorgeous totality pink ! ' do n't blink ! the moon may have shone red for three hours but it was only visible to citizens for five minutes ( pictured over @entity18 ) on the west coast of @entity49 , the total eclipse — what astronomers call totality — began shortly before 5am pt they accompanied their tweet with a picture of a bright pink moon			1
' blood moon ' refers to its orange or red appearance , which is the result of sunlight scattering off @entity7 's atmosphere			1
whether the moon appears dark red , copper , bronze or another shade depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere			0
unlike more lengthy eclipses , the moon in this case only skimmed the upper part of @entity7 's shadow			1
normally , the moon passes through the middle of the shadow , making the eclipse lasts longer			2
@entity85 astronomer @entity84 said before the event : ' some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality , which will make it the shortest since 1917 , but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592			2
' ' blood moon ' refers to its orange or red appearance — the result of sunlight scattering off @entity7 's atmosphere , seen here in @entity100 unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection , you only need clear skies to view this lunar eclipse ( pictured over @entity100 ) whether the moon appears dark red , copper or bronze depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere as well as @entity115 , the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on saturday night from eastern @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity40 the total lunar eclipse is observed above cherry blossoms in @entity120 city , @entity122 district , northeastern @entity40 on saturday @entity123 of the @entity124 in @entity125 added that it was the changes in colour that makes lunar eclipses so interesting			1
the full eclipse of the moon in september will be visible across the @entity12 and @entity13 , as well as western @entity26 and @entity133			2
' @entity134 ' will last around an hour and 20 minutes			0
but those who missed out in @entity14 will have to wait until january 31 , 2018 , for the next lunar eclipse			1
unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection , you only need clear skies to view a lunar eclipse			2
a pair of binoculars or backyard telescope will enhance your view , but are not necessary			0
@entity40 sky - gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the @entity7 's shadow it is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare atmospheric : the sky ( pictured in @entity40 ) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds in @entity157 , where the sun was rising , the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun 's rays from the moon the full moon is seen over the @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity115 , shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse the moon is seen behind downtown high - rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn sky - gazers will have a better chance of catching the next full lunar eclipse on september 28 , that will last over an hour			1

the moon skimmed across the @entity7 's shadow on saturday , reflecting the red glare of the sun
it was the shortest lunar eclipse this century , with ' totality ' only visible for five minutes
