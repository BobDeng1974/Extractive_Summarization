by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 14 february 2013 @entity2 : 13:10 est , 14 february 2013 taking vitamin c to ward off a cold only helps if you exercise regularly , new research suggests			1
@entity8 researchers have found necking drinks rich in vitamin c - such such as orange juice - makes no difference to couch potatoes			1
but in people who work out , vitamin c can halve the risk and even help get rid of the sniffles			1
drinking orange juice wo n't reduce the risk of a cold - unless you exercise scientists from the @entity21 embarked on a series of studies involving more than 11,000 people to work out the benefits of @entity26 , found in many vegetables and fruits , such as oranges , strawberries and kiwis			2
they gave groups of volunteers , including @entity35 school children , marathon runners , teenage competitive swimmers and @entity39 soldiers , a dose of the vitamin and then assessed its impact on their health			2
the researchers discovered that it halved the risk of catching a cold among people under short term physical stress , such as exercise			2
and male teenage swimmers who caught a cold and were treated with the supplement shook off their illness twice as quickly as boys who did n't take the vitamin			0
the researchers also found that children also appear to be more responsive to the vitamin than adults , with a daily one gram dose slashing the average duration of colds in children by 18 per cent and in adults by 8 per cent			1
adults on average only have two or three colds a year , whereas children suffer , on average , half a dozen annually			0
children also appear to be more responsive to the vitamin than adults the study 's authors , @entity75 and @entity76 , concluded : ' the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified , yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise			1
' regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin c reduces the duration of colds , but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out			0
' research published last week found that men who take vitamin c supplements every day double their risk of suffering from kidney stones			0
the excruciating condition is on the rise - and @entity100 researchers say a bi-product of the vitamin may be to blame			0
men who took vitamin c supplements at least once a day had the highest risk of kidney stones , according to research published in the journal @entity109 .			0

@entity111 makes no difference to couch potatoes
but in those who work out , it can halve the risk of a cold and help speed up *recovery* , say @entity8 *experts*
children are more responsive to the vitamin than adults
