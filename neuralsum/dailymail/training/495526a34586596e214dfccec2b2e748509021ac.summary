speaking at a rally in @entity105 , miss @entity103 said : ‘ what we are seeing is a real air of determination to demonstrate that they are sick and tired of education secretary @entity112 's denigration of the profession and the relentless attacks he has made on them , which they believe are attacks on children and young people			0

@entity21 general secretary @entity124 said : " today 's strike action has been a great success and is an indication of the anger and concern that teachers share about the changes this government is making to the profession			1
' strike action does of course always come at a price and we are very well aware of the disruption this causes to parents ' working lives as well as their children 's education			0
' unfortunately , with a government that will not negotiate on the issues of our dispute over pay , pensions and workload , we have been left with little choice			2
' protest : earlier thousands of trade unionists march marched through central @entity27 on the way to @entity10 and the @entity153 she added : ' we do not want to be on strike but if we do not make teaching attractive there will be huge problems for recruiting and retaining good teachers			1
' @entity112 has demoralised an entire profession and today 's action is a direct result of his and the government 's steadfast refusal to accept there are problems that need to be resolved			0
' we urge the government to set aside their prejudices and talk to the profession for the sake of everyone			0

‘ it is very inconvenient for parents , it is not good for pupils ' education , ’ he told @entity176 radio			0
