climate change is killing worrying amounts of birds penguins are in peril because of extreme environmental conditions linked to climate change , research has shown			1
a pair of new studies highlight the plight of penguin colonies trying to cope with the effects of global warming in @entity18 and @entity3			1
at both locations , the beguiling birds face an uncertain future			2
climate change is killing chicks from the world ’s biggest colony of @entity27 penguins at @entity28 , @entity18 , by increasing the rate of drenching rainstorms and heatwaves , say scientists			1
meanwhile @entity1 penguins on @entity34 , @entity3 , are finding it harder to feed as melting sea ice fragments form giant icebergs			1
protected only by a downy coat , the @entity39 chicks can be left to struggle and die when rainstorms hit their colony			2
at other times , faced with extreme heat , their lack of waterproofing means they can not cool off by taking a dip			0
dr @entity49 , from the @entity50 , took part in a 27 year - long study of the 400,000 - strong @entity18 colony			2
he said : ' we ’re going to see years where almost no chicks survive if climate change makes storms bigger and more frequent during vulnerable times of the breeding season , as climatologists predict			1
' during the course of the study , an average 65 per cent of chicks died each year , with some 40 per cent starving			0
climate change was blamed for an average 7 per cent of chick deaths , but in some years was the most common cause of death			1

climate change was blamed for an average 7 per cent of chick deaths , but in some years was the most common cause of death in one year , 43 per cent of all chick deaths were attributed to climate change and in another 50 per cent			1
starvation and the weather were likely to interact increasingly as the climate changed , according to the researchers			2

' starving chicks are more likely to die in a storm , ' said professor @entity92 , also from the @entity50 , who led the study			2
at @entity34 , scientists spent 13 years collecting data on the foraging ability of chick - rearing adelie penguins , which are dependent on year - round sea ice			0
they found that under ' normal ' conditions they were able to cope with changes in sea ice concentrations			0
but the appearance of giant icebergs reduced their chances of catching fish prey			0
how well they would be able to survive if such conditions became more common was unknown			0
' if the frequency of such extreme events increases , then it will become very hard to predict how penguin populations will buffer future sea ice changes , ' said lead researcher dr @entity113 , from the @entity114 in @entity115			0
both studies appear in the latest edition of the online journal @entity119 .			0

birds in @entity18 and @entity3 are dying from shifts in weather
many chicks die from extremes of *temperature* and rainfall
in some years , climate change was biggest cause of death
