by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 13:49 est , 12 march 2014 want to get fitter , faster ? then the new insanity classes rolling out across @entity4 gyms could be for you			1
the hardcore @entity7 workout practised by @entity8 is focussed on high - intensity interval training ( @entity10 )			1
she famously tweeted : ' just did the @entity12 ... amazing			0
. so intense but i loved it ! ' insanity is usually practiced at home on dvd , but for @entity4 gym bunnies lacking discipline , a 45 - minute gym class has launched where you 're put through your paces with the promise of a possible 1,000 - calorie burn			1
to put that into perspective , a spinning class burns just 331 in the same amount of time			0
group exercise manager at the @entity32 , @entity33 , demonstrates from acrobatics the cardio - based , total - body conditioning programme and is based on ' max interval training ' , supposedly a faster way of burning calories			1
traditional @entity10 workouts , which can burn up to 750 calories in 45 minutes , feature short bursts of maximum intensity with longer periods of rest			1
but @entity15 flips that formula upside - down by combining lengthier periods of high intensity exercise with shorter cool downs			1
and now , developers @entity15 have taken the principles of the successful insanity home dvd to create the ' ultimate @entity10 class ' , available at select gyms across @entity4 including the swanky @entity32 and thirtysevendegrees @entity54 , from april onwards			1
taking place in studios with an instructor , the equipment - free classes involve non-stop strenuous stamina training and claim to improve fitness in 60 days , if practiced weekly			1
insanity classes target the entire body , beginning with an accelerated warmup and moving into three intense blocks of work , each one targeting a different element of fitness			1
first is plyometrics and endurance - essentially ' jump training ' where muscles exert maximum force in as short a time as possible			1
then the class moves on to strength and balance before the final section on agility and co-ordination			0
you finish with eight minutes of functional core work and a stretch			0
i headed to the @entity32 gym full of enthusiasm after having recently vowing to start working out three times a week to improve my fitness			1
i 'd heard it was one of the hardest workouts out there and although i was a little intimidated , i was keen to get stuck in			0
once we got going i found it very hard and very quick			0
the moves were faster than any speed i 'm comfortable moving at ( a bit like when spinning instructors tell you to sprint when you 're knackered )			0
lots of floor work , burpees , jumps , lunges - everything in max - impact mode			2
i found myself slipping over once in a while and also taking the low - impact option on a few occasions			2
everyone else in the class , though , was committed to the workout and pushed themselves to the max. the class was held in a giant gleaming studio and once we got going i found it very jumpy and quick after the shakes and exhaustion surpassed , the workout was ultimately satisfying			0
if i kept it up , i could surely get up to the level of my fellow gym - goers			2
as long as your health is good do n't be afraid to push yourself for real results			0
an instructor will always ask if you have any injuries and advise on low - impact variations to suit , but , generally , we can achieve more than we think we 're capable of , and insanity 's the proof			2
at least in the gym			0
would i go back ? were i a member of @entity32 , yes , for sure			0
i 'd do this once a week as i think variety is key , and this class seems like a golden addition to any fitness regime			2
that bit you dread but the push you need			0
@entity141 participants work out at the very limits of their capability for three to four minute bursts of intense , dynamic exercises , which are spaced with rests or ' cools down ' for about 30 seconds , before the whole process is repeated			2
instructors provide low - impact options for each move so the class is accessible to all fitness levels			1
watch full video on @entity155 here			0
' adding high - intensity exercise forces the body to use fast - twitch muscle fibers not normally engaged in cardio exercise , ' explains a spokesperson for @entity15			2
' these fast - twitch fibers continue burning fuel even during lower - intensity exercise			2
insanity 's high - intensity activity forces the body to work for longer periods of time at a higher capacity than traditional workouts			0
' people experience faster increases in cardiovascular fitness , and burn carbohydrates and fat more efficiently - as much as 1,000 calories per hour , with the enhanced calorie burn lasting anywhere from three to 24 hours after completion of the workout			1
' as a result , the workout , developed by personal trainer @entity181 in 2009 , claims to be the most effective workout programmes around			0
insanity classes at @entity32 , @entity185 , @entity186 , membership Â £ 116 per month or Â £ 69 for weekend - only , reebokclub.co.uk an insanity event where participants have a go at press - ups an instructor stands at the front and dictates the class , giving low - intensity options for all levels			1
