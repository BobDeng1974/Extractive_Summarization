more than a billion people are long - sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try to carry out simple tasks like reading a book			1
but a new procedure could provide an alternative to reading glasses for people with the age - related condition presbyopia			1
it involves slicing the eye open and inserting a tiny lens under the cornea , the clear film that covers the front of the eyeball			1
more than a billion people are long - sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try and read a newspaper , for example			1
but a procedure could prove an alternative to reading glasses ( stock image ) for people with the age - related condition , called presbyopia by implanting an inlay into their cornea researchers told the annual meeting of the @entity30 that the implanted doughnut - shaped inlay improved near vision for 83 per cent of volunteers over the age of 40			1
they said that after the operation , the majority of patients were able to read a newspaper without the aid of reading glasses – and the inlay did n’t disturb far distance vision needed for daily activities , such as driving			1
the @entity47 inlay measures 3.8 millimetres in diameter and has a 1.6 millimetres hole in the centre			1
it is undergoing clinical review			0
presbyopia affects more than one billion people worldwide - mostly over the age of 40			2
as people age , the cornea becomes less flexible and bends in such a way that it becomes difficult to see up close			1
while the most common remedy is wearing reading glasses , a host of new corneal inlay products are in development to treat the condition , with three types currently under review by the @entity66 ( @entity66 )			1
the theoretical advantage of using corneal inlays over wearing reading glasses is that corneal inlays prevent the need for constantly putting on and taking off glasses , depending on whether the person needs to see near or far			2
however , all three inlays require an operation			0
the procedure involves the eye being sliced open and a @entity79 lens inserted into the cornea			1
there are already alternatives on the market , such as the @entity85 lens ( illustrated ) which is also inserted into a patient 's eye during a medical procedure			1
the operation to insert the implant lasts 10 minutes under local anaesthetic			2
the new technique could replace laser eye surgery ( stock image ) which can leave some patients still needing glasses so far , clinicians in the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have studied the effect of the lenses in 507 patients with presbyopia between the age of 40 and 60			1
they checked up on the patients over three years and found that in 83 per cent of them , the @entity47 lenses gave them 20/40 vision or better			0
on average , patients gained 2.9 lines on a reading chart			0
past attempts at implanting corneal inlays have given patients hazy vision , although this was treatable with steroids			0
but this more advanced procedure is reversible because the inlays can be removed			0
dr @entity119 , a professor in ophthalmology and vision sciences at the @entity122 , @entity123 , said : ‘ @entity125 inlays represent a great opportunity to improve vision with a safety net of removability			0
’ while the @entity79 lens and procedure has not yet been approved by the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) it is on sale in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity133			2
there are two other types of corneal inlays - @entity137 and @entity138 , which are also in development for the @entity98 market			2
as well as the @entity47 implant , there is a similar one called a ' @entity85 ' that is also waiting for approval from the @entity66			0
the @entity137 is implanted underneath the cornea to correct vision			0
the technique was pioneered in @entity133 , but has made its way across the @entity150 and is now being used at @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity153			0
it could replace laser surgery , which until now has been deemed the only long - term treatment , even though it leaves some recipients requiring reading glasses in dim light			2
the procedure takes around 10 minutes , compared to laser surgery which takes approximately one hour			0
anaesthetic droplets are inserted into the patient 's eye so they remain conscious throughout the procedure , as the implant is placed under a flap of the cornea			2
it corrects near medium vision by changing the shape of the cornea , with the central section becoming steeper			0
the procedure costs £ 2,495 and is not currently available on the @entity174 .			0

@entity79 inlay , developed in the @entity98 , measures 3.8 millimetres in diameter and has a 1.6 millimetres hole in the centre
procedure to implant the inlay could be an alternative to reading glasses for people with the age - related condition , called presbyopia
involves the eye being sliced open and a lens inserted into the cornea
after the operation , the majority of patients were able to read a newspaper
procedure did *n't* disturb their far distance vision , in medical tests
