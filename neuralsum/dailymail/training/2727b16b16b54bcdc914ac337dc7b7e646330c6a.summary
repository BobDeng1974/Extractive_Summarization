by @entity1 reporter published : 20:51 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 08:22 est , 17 june 2012 an @entity3 stuntman has become the first person in more than a century to cross the @entity5 on a tightrope			1
@entity7 , 33 , was watched by an estimated one billion tv viewers and more than 125,000 sightseers at the famous gorge			1
he took 25 minutes to traverse the 1,800ft gap from @entity12 to the @entity3 on a 2 in - thick steel cable on friday night			1
the water crashed over the precipice at 65mph , 200ft below him , and he was buffeted by swirling clouds of spray			2
but ignoring the no 1 rule of tightrope - walking , he looked down as he walked , rather than straight ahead			2
to aid his balance , he held a 40ft pole , attached by a brace to his neck			2
he also wore a safety harness attached to the cable			2
‘ this is what dreams are made of , ’ said @entity7 shortly after he stepped off from a platform on the @entity3 shore			1
‘ i hope what i just did inspires people to reach for the skies			2
’ @entity3 @entity35 , 21 , made several crossings of the gorge in 1896 , but it was further from the waterfall and not as dangerous as @entity7 ’s walk			1
feat : @entity7 walks across the @entity5 in an attempt to be the first man ever to complete the walk danger : mr @entity7 was finely poised above the surging waterfall which has taken many casualties in the past relief : the daredevil punched the air when he made it to the other side after 25 minutes @entity53 : mr @entity7 described the view over the @entity5 , which he is the only person ever to have seen , as ' breathtaking ' torrents : the skilled tightrope walker never broke his concentration , even when surrounded by the rush of thousands of gallons of water spray : the water coming off the @entity5 was just one of several weather phenomena which mr @entity7 had to contend with scale : from afar , the walker is barely visible against the background of the mighty @entity5 breathtaking : the spectacle enjoyed by mr @entity7 during his unique experience is unlike that granted to anyone else setting out : mr @entity7 pictured just a couple of minutes after starting his walk , when he was still walking downhill into the ' valley ' of the rope @entity7 , whose next stunt will be an attempt to traverse the @entity78 , took steady , measured steps across the mist - fogged brink of the roaring falls			1
the daring acrobat set off around 10.15 to whoops and cheers from the huge crowd at the atmospheric event			0
an estimated crowd of 125,000 people on the @entity12 side and 4,000 on the @entity3 side watched			1
along the way , he calmly prayed aloud			0
afterwards , he said he accomplished the feat through ' a lot of praying , that 's for sure			0
but , you know , it 's all about the concentration , the focus , and the training			0
' the seventh - generation member of the famed @entity101 had long dreamed of pulling off the stunt , never before attempted			0
after he made it to the @entity12 side of the falls , mr @entity7 said that at one point in the middle of the stunt , he thought about his great - grandfather and the walks he had taken : ' that 's what this is all about , paying tribute to my ancestors , and my hero , @entity117			1
' scenic : those who made the journey to watch mr @entity7 were awarded with a once - in - a - lifetime view nearly there : mr @entity7 became visibly more cheerful , though tired , when he was in sight of his @entity12 destination home stretch : mr @entity7 showboats for the crowd as he reaches the final few yards of his amazing walk coming in : the acrobat was delighted to find an eager crowd waiting for him when he arrived in @entity12 departure : crowds in @entity132 watch mr @entity7 start his quest to cross the @entity134 , unsure if he would make it all the way packed : there was barely enough space for all those who wanted to watch the feat to do so a festive crowd started to gather on both sides of the border on friday afternoon , spreading blankets and setting up folding chairs under picture - perfect blue skies and summer - like temperatures			1
' we 're here on a lark			0
we 're looking for an adventure , ' said @entity152 , who with her husband pulled their nine - and 11 - year - old kids out of school early to stake out space on a grassy slope across from where mr @entity7 finished his walk on the @entity12 side			1
ms @entity152 , of @entity162 , @entity163 , was all in favor of the tether , mr @entity7 's one safeguard , designed to keep him out of the water if he falls			1
' i think we have enough gore on tv , ' she said			0
@entity171 : this graphic shows how mr @entity7 plans to make his way from the @entity3 side of the @entity134 to the @entity12 side waiting for him : the tightrope across @entity5 pictured ahead of @entity7 's attempt to walk across it on friday night daredevil : mr @entity7 's feat will be unprecedented if he makes it all the way across the iconic waterfall crowd : spectators assemble on the @entity12 border to watch mr @entity7 make his attempt the first to cross the gorge : @entity191 acrobat and tightrope walker @entity189 was the first ever person to cross a section of @entity5 on a 1,000 foot long tightrope in 1859 , but chose a calmer spot downstream length of wire : 1,800 @entity198 : 7 @entity199 : 2 @entity200 : steelhow it 's installed : helicopter flew lighter tension wire across @entity204			1
that acts as guide for cable to be pulled by machines across the @entity209 it 's secured : bolts are sunk deep into bedrock , several hundred yards back from each @entity214 time for walk : 30 - 40 @entity217 footwear : @entity219 - soled shoes custom - made by his @entity221 pole : 30 feet long ; 40 @entity224 attendance : 125,000 in @entity12 ; 4,000 on @entity225 : from the @entity3 to @entity227 forecast for friday night : temperatures in the low 60s with winds out of the east at 10 mph or @entity232 of @entity233 of cable above brink : 20 @entity236 of water : 600,000 gallons per second a c - shaped clamp trailed behind him on the walk , designed to allow free passage over the pendulum anchors			1
if he had slipped , he would dangle by his waist about eight feet below the wire to wait for rescue			0
@entity246 , which televised the walk , insisted on it			2
mr @entity7 said he only agreed because he was not willing to lose the chance and needed @entity246 's sponsorship to help offset some of the $ 1.3million cost of the spectacle			1
conditions were good leading up to the nationally televised stunt scheduled for friday night			0
when he left terra firma about 10.15pm , the temperature was in the low 60s with winds under 10mph from the east , roughly at his back			2
' i think it 's a crazy idea , ' said @entity263 , 59 , he drove from @entity264 to watch the walk from the @entity12 shore			1
' someone has to be really committed			0
you ca n't just say , " oh , i want to try it			0
" he 's got my respect for that			0
' on the @entity3 side of the falls , cars lined the road into @entity276 as people jockeyed for good spots to watch mr @entity7 's 1,800 - foot walk on a two - inch wire through the mist rising from the falls			1
for the 33 - year - old father of three , the @entity5 walk was unlike anything he has ever done			2
because it was over water , the two - inch wire did not have the usual stabiliser cables to keep it from swinging			0
pendulum anchors were designed to keep it from twisting under the elkskin - soled shoes designed by his mother			0
the wallendas trace their roots to 1780 @entity294 , when ancestors traveled as a band of acrobats , aerialists , jugglers , animal trainers and trapeze artists			0
in 1928 , the family gave its inaugural performance at @entity305 and earned a 15 - minute standing ovation from an astounded audience , who marveled at them performing without a safety net			0
and the clan has been touched by tragedy , notably in 1978 when patriarch @entity117 , @entity7 's great - grandfather , fell to his death during a stunt in @entity314			2
about a dozen other tightrope artists have crossed the @entity204 downstream , dating to @entity189 , aka @entity316 , in 1859			0
but no one has walked directly over the falls and authorities have not allowed any tightrope acts in the area since 1896			0
it took mr @entity7 two years to persuade @entity3 and @entity12 authorities to allow it and many civic leaders hoped to use the publicity to jumpstart the region 's struggling economy , particularly on the @entity3 side of the falls .			1

@entity7 is the first person to walk over the @entity134 at their greatest extent and took just 25 minutes to do it
he *battled* high winds and spray in order to avoid 190ft fall ( but he was tethered by a cable )
thousands gather in @entity3 and @entity12 to watch *historic* record attempt
