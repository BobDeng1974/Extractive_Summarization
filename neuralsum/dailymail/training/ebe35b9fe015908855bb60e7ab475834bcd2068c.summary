the gambling aspect of @entity2 ’s management style has been a major contributing factor to @entity5 ’s ridiculous rise to prominence , and the striker knows it			1
@entity5 is set to start for @entity8 against @entity9 in the @entity11 final at @entity12 on sunday , but knows his career might have gone down a much different path			1
that ’s down to @entity2 , who the 21 - year - old says changed his prospects			1
@entity5 wants other players to be given similar opportunities and believes there is a lack of faith in prospects			2
@entity5 knows he is indebted to @entity2 for his fast rise at @entity8 @entity5 scored twice against @entity9 when @entity8 beat them 5 - 3 back in january at @entity26 @entity2 took a leap of faith with @entity5 , who he had managed in the development squad @entity5 was talking to the weekly @entity31 magazine the pair had previously worked together before the now @entity34 boss was handed the first - term reins last season			1
and , even though @entity5 had impressed in fits and starts , he had n’t looked like breaking through permanently			2
now , with 24 goals in 37 games this season , @entity39 is certain to call the youngster up to his @entity44 squad next month			0
‘ @entity2 first of all played me [ regularly ] in the @entity45 , ’ @entity5 told @entity31			1
‘ i knew @entity2 from the development squad , and we had a great relationship			2
‘ he threw me in when maybe other managers would n’t have			0
maybe that ’s what a few more young strikers coming through need			0
’ @entity5 ’s rise to prominence has been swift , the plaudits plentiful ; some have characterised the front man as a hybrid of @entity60 and @entity61			1
‘ i can see a bit of both in me , which is n’t bad , to be honest , ' @entity5 added			2
‘ to be compared to someone like @entity60 is very special			0
he ’s the all - time @entity45 top goalscorer			0
if i score anywhere near as many as he did , it would n’t be a bad career			0
‘ i feel sometimes i play in both of those roles for @entity8 , and i see little bits that they had in my game			1
@entity60 was a great finisher , and i like to think i ’m a good finisher			0
‘ @entity61 brought others into play , so you can definitely say i have some similar attributes			0
hopefully i can do well and continue to score goals , and one day people will say that this player is like @entity5			2
’ @entity5 has scored 24 goals in just 34 appearances for @entity8 under @entity84 this season @entity5 was in the stands to see @entity8 beat @entity9 in the 2008 @entity11 final it matters little to @entity5 who he resembles on sunday , so long as it is he who sinks @entity9			1
this was the @entity8 fan who stood in the stands in 2008 to watch his team beat the @entity94 and who is now living out his childhood dreams			1
‘ i was there watching @entity8 beat @entity9 on the big stage , and winning trophies , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ it was something i grew up dreaming of doing , and now i have the opportunity			0
‘ to win a trophy for a club like @entity8 would be something very special , but we want to try and get into the @entity107 too , so we ’re focused on doing the best we can in every competition			0
’ you can read the full interview online here or in print from friday .			0

@entity8 play @entity9 in the @entity11 final on sunday
@entity5 has been exceptional for @entity84 this season
but the 21 - year - old *credits* @entity2 with his rise
@entity5 was in the stands at @entity12 when @entity8 beat @entity9 in 2008
