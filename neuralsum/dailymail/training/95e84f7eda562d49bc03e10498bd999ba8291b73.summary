by @entity0 published : 00:56 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 00:57 est , 19 october 2013 a recent study discovered the brain activity of former @entity4 players is abnormal when compared to non-football players			1
the revelation comes after @entity8 researchers compared the brains of 13 unnamed former footballers to 60 healthy individuals and found that the activity in the frontal lobe of the former players ’ brains differed significantly from that of the non-players			1
the frontal lobe is responsible for the cognitive processes in the brain , abnormalities in activity can lead to difficulties with planning and other everyday tasks , the study said			2
drastic difference : a researcher points to the drastic increase in brain activity among former @entity4 players scientists conducted a study where all participants had to rearrange colored balls into multiple tubes in the fewest possible steps while undergoing an mri , the @entity31 explained in a release detailing the findings			1
though the former players performed slightly worse than the volunteers , their brain activity differed dramatically			1
‘ the @entity4 alumni showed some of the most pronounced abnormalities in brain activity that i have ever seen , and i have processed a lot of patient data sets in the past , ’ lead study author dr @entity44 said			1
the difference was striking enough that a computer program was able to differentiate between former gridiron greats and average joes with a 90 per cent success rate , the study said			0
scientists determined the increased frontal lobe activity was the result of repeated blows to the head during football games			2
‘ the critical fact is that the level of brain abnormality correlates strongly with the measure of head impacts of great enough severity to warrant being taken out of play , ’ dr @entity44 explained			2
brain problems : @entity72 experienced insomnia and other symptoms of brain trauma after retiring from the @entity4 - he committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest so his brain could be studied these blows , the doctor continued , have far reaching consequences			1
‘ this means that it is highly likely that damage caused by blows to the head accumulate towards an executive impairment in later life , ’ he added			0
several safety measures have been put in place in recent years by the league , including rules against hitting defenseless players , leading with helmets and ‘ launching ’ into players – a term used for defenders jumping into the players to violently tackle them			0
tougher concussion protocols and tests have also been introduced , but dr @entity44 cautioned they still are n’t enough			0
‘ researchers have put a lot of time into developing tests to pick up on executive dysfunction , but none of them work at all well , ’ he lamented			0
‘ it ’s not unusual for an individual who has had a blow to the head to perform relatively well on a neuropsychological testing battery , and then go on to struggle in everyday life			0
’ dr @entity44 did admit his study was only preliminary and that more testing would need to be done , but it may provide more ammo to the league ’s detractors – including four players who filed a concussion lawsuit only days after the league settled a similar suit in august .			0

13 former @entity4 players were tested against 60 non-players
the former players performed only *modestly* worse than the non-players
but their brain activity was dramatically increased
