by @entity0 for @entity1 if you enjoy scaling mountains , scuba diving or splashing around in water parks , this expansive swimming pool shows you can do it all from the comfort of your own home - as long as you have an extra $ 2 million floating around			1
the luxurious , 140ft - long pool in @entity12 , @entity10 features a towering man - made mountain , five waterfalls , a lazy river and is deep enough for its owners to practice their scuba diving			1
the feat of creative and engineering genius featured on @entity23 's ' @entity22 '			0
the man - made mountain ' emulates the natural surroundings perfectly ' , @entity49 , the host of @entity22 , says on the episode			1
the tallest of the five waterfalls stretches to 20ft and forces more than 3,000 gallons of water per minute over the edge			2
the falls can also be reached from nooks inside the mountain			2
atop the massive boulder are bridges , pathways and steps that lead to the waterslide and give views over the 140ft by 60ft pool - which holds 360,000 gallons of water in total - in all its glory			1
luxury : swimmers that are scuba dive certified can also descend to 26ft through an entrance inside exploring : the underwater route then brings the swimmer back out to the main swimming pool hidden away : inside the mountain , there is also a kitchen with a grill and granite topped surfaces lair : there is also a whole changing room with showers , lockers and a bathroom for freshening up but the mountain has more inside than cement and the occasional secret passageway - it also houses a kitchen with granite counter tops , an eight burner grill and a refrigerator			1
a separate room holds changing rooms , lockers and a shower			0
encircling the entire pool is a 300ft lazy river , which is propelled by jets			0
or if you fancy being a little more active , you can don a wet suit and descend to as deep as 26 feet to check out the bottom of the pool			0
if you take this route , you enter from an excluded entry point inside the mountain then take a 54ft long and 5ft wide tunnel into the pool			1
not bad for a home nearly 1,000 miles from the ocean			0
the show did not name the family lucky enough to own the pool			2
