rabbi @entity0 , an @entity1 author and father - of - nine famed for his uniquely progressive approach , has claimed that in @entity6 law , ' a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does			1
' rabbi @entity0 , 47 and based in @entity9 , acknowledges that people tend to see @entity1 as ' frigid and inhibited ' but told @entity11 : ' it ’s absolutely not true			1
among us religious @entity6 , sex is a big deal			2
' he added : ' oral sex is fine			2
anal ? yeah , why not ? sex toys are great			1
she wants @entity19 ? sure			0
what ’s wrong with @entity19 ? there ’s nothing un-kosher about it			0
' in regards to the rule @entity40 mentioned about women being required to orgasm before their husbands , its origins trace back to centuries ago , and its motive is not primarily concerned with pleasure			2
the rule is mentioned in the @entity46 - a compendium of discussions had by @entity6 scholars between 200 and 500 a.d. - and was a sex tactic believed to encourage the birth of a boy			1
family : rabbi @entity0 , 47 , says that although people tend to see @entity1 as ' frigid and inhibited ... it ’s absolutely not true			1
' pictured with his wife @entity57 ( right ) and five of his nine children racy : he remarked , ' oral sex is fine			2
anal ? yeah , why not ? sex toys are great			1
she wants @entity19 ? sure			0
what ’s wrong with @entity19 ? there ’s nothing un-kosher about it ' rabbi @entity0 also suggests the missionary position as being the most intimate way for married couples to have sex , although he notes that ' all positions are great			1
' according to him , @entity6 law , as written in a kabbalistic text called @entity75 , requires full - body contact during sex , and for both men and women to keep their eyes open throughout			1
one line from the @entity82 - the first book of the @entity83 - has been interpreted as reading that man and woman were initially created as one body to be split into two			0
when they were fused , the man and the woman were understood to be facing away from one another			0
thus when a man and woman face each other during sex and look into each other 's eyes , they perfect creation			2
passion : the controversial @entity67 pointed out that although our ' single years ' are generally supposed to be our wildest , marriage should be about ' swinging from chandeliers ' playing @entity103 : rabbi @entity0 suggests the missionary position as being the most intimate way for married couples to have sex , although he notes that ' all positions are great ' rabbi @entity0 also touched on the @entity1 law that forbids couples from having sex for 12 days every month ; five days of menstruation and seven days after			1
this ' sexual unavailability ' apparently drives @entity1 men crazy with ' lust , ' which stokes the fires of a passionate marriage			2
he also argues that because whatever body parts women cover up in public become ' erogenous ' by default , @entity1 women , who wear wigs to cover their natural hair , have more of these ' zones			0
' ' hair is one of the sexiest things around , ' he remarks			0
' my wife has beautiful hair , thank @entity130			0
she wears a wig , in public			0
' friends in high places : the @entity67 , pictured with former - friend @entity136 , says , ' hair is one of the sexiest things around			0
my wife has beautiful hair , thank @entity130			0
she wears a wig , in public ' @entity142 va vroom : rabbi @entity0 's use of ancient texts and lesser - mentioned @entity6 wisdom to discuss modern sex has attracted praise as well as criticism			1
pictured in 2011 on his motorbike in @entity151 , rabbi @entity0 also advises that couples keep an air of mystery between them to keep their chemistry intact , as too much information can erode at their desire for one another			1
for example , he recommends that couples shut the door when they go to the bathroom , as ‘ obstacles create greater desire			0
’ writer : rabbi @entity0 is the author of over 30 books , including this , his latest he also advises against walking around naked , especially when the other party is engaged with another object - like the tv			1
being naked too often will cause the other party to lose interest , and makes it less of a special occasion , he suggests			0
rabbi @entity0 's use of ancient texts and lesser - mentioned @entity6 wisdom to discuss modern sex and marriage has attracted praise as well as criticism			1
talking so openly about sexual matters , for example , is not considered to be ' tznius ' - which means modest - and thus contradicts an important @entity6 value			2
rabbi @entity0 argues that he is doing the @entity6 community a service by encouraging healthy intimate monogamous unions , and doing so in a way that modern people can relate to			1
the outspoken rabbi has now authored over 30 books , appeared on the @entity193 on numerous occasions , and during the 1990s , became a close friend and ' unofficial spiritual adviser ' to the late @entity136			0
he lives with his wife @entity197 and his nine children .			0

according to ancient @entity6 *scripture* , ensuring women *climaxed* before men was believed to spark the birth of a boy
rabbi @entity0 also approves of ' oral sex , ' ' anal , ' ' sex toys ' and 's *&* m '
