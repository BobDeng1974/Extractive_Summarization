pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities , prompting expert warnings of a plague of ' super-rats '			1
information released to @entity6 by councils has revealed deep cuts in the amounts being spent on controlling vermin			2
across 200 local authorities in @entity12 , pest control budgets have been cut by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010			1
there has also been a 16 per cent cut in the amounts spent on street cleaning			1
pest control budgets have been slashed by a quarter by local authorities , prompting expert warnings of a plague of ' super-rats ' some authorities insist they have taken steps to provide better value for money , accounting for reductions in budgets			1
but others admit they have stopped providing pest control services altogether			2
traditionally , people have been able to call out pest control officers from their local authorities if their homes are infested with mice , rats , wasps or other pests			1
many councils have offered free assessments , and then made subsidised charges for proofing , poisons or other recommended measures			0
the decline in local authority services means more people are likely to attempt ineffective and sometimes dangerous diy solutions , increasing the numbers of pests , experts said			0
reports this year suggest that rats in the @entity52 are becoming bigger , and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of control			1
so - called ' super rats ' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year			1
@entity6 mp @entity59 said pest control budgets had been reduced by a quarter in real terms genetic testing by @entity63 has revealed that some rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons			1
in counties including @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , all the rats tested were found to have immunity to poison			0
@entity59 , @entity6 's shadow communities and local government secretary , said : ' street cleaning and pest control budgets have been reduced by a quarter in real terms and @entity83 has failed to live up to his vows before the last election on waste collection			1
' taken in the round , his failure to work with councils to deal with the reductions in their funding risks undermining the cleanliness that makes us proud to live in our communities			0
' this is worsened by the fact that his cuts have been unfairly distributed , with leafy @entity99 in @entity72 seeing an increase in spending power over this @entity103 while less wealthy communities – urban and rural – have been hit far harder			2
' @entity6 would devolve power and money to local areas and work with them to find savings through collaboration , allowing them to protect the frontline services residents expect and rely on			0
' the biggest budget cuts have been seen in the @entity114 , where spending on pest control is down 25 per cent , and the @entity117 , by 24 per cent			1
the @entity119 , by contrast , has all but maintained spending , with only a two per cent cut since 2010			2
@entity121 , head of the technical training academy at @entity123 , said : ' any reduction in pest control budgets is potentially going to result in more people attempting diy solutions			1
reports this year suggest that rats in the @entity52 are becoming bigger , and some are developing resistance to traditional methods of pest control ' the big issue around @entity136 pest control is the pitfalls of untrained people applying pesticides that could potentially cause harm to themselves , neighbours , or , more likely , non-target animals such as domestic pets or other wildlife that may visit a garden where someone is trying to control rats without a full understanding of the repercussions or effects that anticoagulant rodenticides can have further down the food chain			1
@entity155 16 % @entity156 23 % @entity157 21 % @entity158 15 % @entity114 25 % @entity117 24 % @entity159 16 % @entity119 2 % @entity160 and @entity161 23 % ' it is also key to remember that pests are a symptom of a particular environment - while the rats are the obvious problem , they may only be present in a certain area because of issues around fly - tipping or less apparent problems such as drainage defects			2
the amateur user of a pesticide will probably not understand this , may fail to find the root cause of the problem and may therefore fail to gain control quickly and sustainably - in other words reacting to the rats , rather than taking a more proactive and long term approach to the wider issue			2
' communities minister @entity183 rejected @entity6 's criticism			0
he said : ' under @entity6 , council tax doubled and bin collections halved			0
as minister for @entity188 , @entity59 was the @entity6 architect of bin cuts , bin fines and bin taxes - the @entity193 to @entity6 ’s town hall @entity195			0
' conservatives in @entity197 are supporting weekly collections and abolished @entity6 's plans for bin taxes which would have see fly - tipping soar			0
' councils need to make savings to help pay off @entity6 's deficit , but they should do so by protecting frontline services and more joint working , better procurement and cutting waste			0
by contrast , the @entity197 in @entity209 now wants councils to empty bins monthly			0
@entity6 are n't @entity212 , they 're friends of the rats			0

council pest control budgets fall by 24.4 per cent on average since 2010
experts warn cuts have led to plague of ' super-rats ' that are much larger
spending on street cleaning has also fallen by 16 per cent across @entity52
' @entity228 rats ' are expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year
