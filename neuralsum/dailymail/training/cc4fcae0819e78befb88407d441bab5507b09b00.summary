by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:14 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 3 december 2013 a flagship government scheme to tackle @entity4 ’s troubled families has helped just 720 people back to work			1
the @entity8 spending watchdog warned the scheme , which set an overall target of getting 20,000 into jobs , was ‘ under - performing ’ and urged ministers to intervene more quickly when things go wrong			1
the project is supposed to turn around so - called ‘ @entity20 ’ families , with children back in school , crime cut and thousands of parents back in work			1
the @entity23 project managed to get only 720 into a job , against a target of almost 20,000 ministers said they wanted to end the ‘ it ’s not my fault ’ culture which allowed up to 120,000 problem families to avoid taking responsibility for their own lives			2
the @entity34 ’s ‘ troubled families ’ programme has a budget of £ 448 million			2
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) aimed to get 22 per cent of people on the programme into work employment over three years to march 2015 , with a budget of £ 200 million			1
but the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) said the @entity23 programme had achieved only resulted in 720 people finding work , just 4 per cent of its target			1
none of the firms it was using to provide services had met the department 's target			0
the @entity41 said that while there was evidence that families were beginning to benefit from the programmes , there was a risk that expectations will not be achieved			1
@entity58 , head of the @entity41 , said : ‘ these innovative and ambitious programmes are beginning to provide some benefits but elements of both are underperforming			1
community secretary @entity63 said the ' no nonsense ' approach of the scheme was working ‘ this is the result of poor co-ordination between the departments when designing and implementing their programmes and of the risks taken in launching the programmes quickly			0
’ she claimed there was a lack of understanding about how councils and companies would use the payment by results scheme			0
‘ to achieve their objectives , the departments need to continue to liaise with one another and monitor the success rate of both programmes , adjusting them when necessary			0
‘ they must continue to work with local authorities and contractors to understand why performance is so varied , intervene if it does not improve , and quickly build an evidence base to show which interventions work best			2
’ local authorities in @entity94 have turned around 22,000 families , exceeding a 3 per cent target , but they have attached only 62,000 families to the programme , 13 per cent below an @entity41 estimate			1
the government has estimated that the cost to the taxpayer of troubled families was around £ 9 billion annually for the spending review period of 2010 - 2015 , before the programme was introduced			2
of the total , the government estimated that £ 1 billion was spent tackling issues including mental health and drug and substance misuse , and £ 8 billion was spent reacting on areas including social care and the costs of crime , such as court costs			0
@entity117 , general secretary of the @entity118 , said : ‘ it 's difficult to see the @entity23 programme as anything other than a catastrophe for the vulnerable families who deserve our help but are being let down			0
‘ first with the work programme and now this , private companies are proving themselves incapable of providing the kind of complex , dedicated support necessary , despite the hundreds of millions of pounds of public money being funnelled their way			0
’ mr @entity117 said the poor results also showed that giving work to private firms was ‘ fantastically misguided			0
’ @entity138 launched the troubled families programme in the wake of the 2011 riots in @entity141 and other @entity94 cities a @entity23 spokesman said the numbers reported by the @entity41 only told part of the story , adding : ‘ @entity147 is doing far more for members of troubled families , including loaning 150 jobcentre advisers to local authorities to help them support people into work			1
‘ @entity154 published last week showed that since the troubled families programme started in april 2012 , 2,400 members of troubled families started a job			0
this data only covered fewer than half the number of people from troubled families local authorities are currently working with , so we expect the real number helped into work to be much greater			0
