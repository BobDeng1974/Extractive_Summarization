by @entity1 reporter new @entity3 manager @entity2 wants football 's governing bodies to do more to create opportunities for black coaches			1
the former @entity9 boss is currently the only black manger in the top four divisions after replacing @entity12 at the @entity14 helm on wednesday			1
in recent seasons @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have all managed in the @entity21 but none of them are currently a number one			1
time for change : @entity26 boss @entity2 thinks there should be more opportunities for black coaches out of work : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) are two black coaches currently out of work and while @entity2 believes that any appointments made by clubs should be on merit , he is eager to see more black coaches given the chance to thrive in management			1
' it does n't look great , but all you can do is get your badges and become as qualified as you can , ' he told the @entity41			2
' i believe that all the governing bodies should get together to reach agreement about how to move forward			1
people like myself , @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 , we 've all proven that we can manage			1
we are all role models			2
' only one of us is working in the professional game at the moment			0
my appointment here , and all our track records , show that we can take positions of responsibility and be successful			2
' @entity2 was successful at @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
i was also @entity57 chairman for five years , so i can lead people			0
' i ca n't answer for people who run football clubs			0
you can only apply for jobs , then do them to the best of your ability			0
you have to be good at your job			0
@entity69 rule : @entity70 , owner of the @entity71 , has a long - standing history of giving @entity74 's a chance to manage in the @entity75 , and therefore brought about the @entity69 rule ' but the @entity76 and @entity77 and other bodies should try and agree to implement measures that will help			1
' in @entity80 , the @entity69 rule requires teams to interview ' minority ' candidates for all head coaching positions and @entity2 believes it is vital black coaches are given more interview opportunities			1
' it ensures that black and minority ethnic coaches are getting interviewed , ' he said			2
' but it 's not a question of whether i want it			0
it 's a question of whether all football 's governing bodies can all agree to it			1
' it 's about giving people a chance to get interviews in the first place but then it 's still up to you to prove you are the right person			0
' he added : ' you always have to prove you are the best			0
if people reject you for whatever reasons it should never dissuade you from keeping on trying			0
' people like @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity17 are good managers , who happen to be black			1
i believe football is trying to move forward on this			0
