it could mean the end of scrabbling for your credit card - and your hpone			1
@entity5 's internet tycoon @entity4 , founder of giant online merchant @entity6 , gave a glimpse of the future when he demonstrated a new e-payment system using facial recognition at the @entity11 fair in @entity12			1
@entity13 - crossing the stage in the style of a @entity17 pioneer late sunday , @entity4 showed off the technology that uses facial recognition from a smartphone camera selfie as a digital signature			1
the founder and executive chairman of @entity6 , @entity4 , speaks during the official opening of the @entity26 technology fair in @entity27 , @entity12 on march 15 , 2015 © @entity28 ( @entity29 ) cards are linked to @entity31 , and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using a phone 's contactless @entity36 chip @entity31 is a free mobile payment and digital wallet that securely stores a user 's credit cards , debit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and offers			1
cards are linked to the wallet , and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using contactless @entity36 chips			1
developers can currently use this @entity52 to add ' buy with @entity54 ' buttons to apps , which @entity56 would effectively supersede if it works as expected			1
' i want to take this opportunity to demonstrate a small innovative product that we designed , ' @entity4 said			1
he used the technology to buy a gift for the mayor of @entity27 — a souvenir stamp dating back to one of the city 's trade fairs in 1948 — found on @entity6 , of course			1
' using online payments to buy things is always a big headache , ' he said			1
' you forget your password , you worry about security			1
' today we 'll show you a new technology , how in the future people will buy things online			1
' on a smartphone he pressed a ' buy ' button , which triggered a face - recognition routine			1
@entity4 , a former teacher , is known for thinking big , and at this week 's @entity26 he was the keynote speaker , addressing an audience that included @entity12 chancellor @entity84			1
like many other companies from the event 's official partner country @entity5 , @entity6 -- flush with cash from a massive stock listing -- is looking beyond the borders of its huge domestic market of 1.2 billion people , to the world			2
@entity4 enthused that , while the industrial revolution freed workers from hard labour , the digital ' revolution ... liberates the strength of the human brain '			2
' it 's not the technology that can change the world , it 's the dreams behind the technology that change the world , ' the 50 - year - old told the audience , adding that his dream was to help small enterprises sell on a global market			2
@entity4 has not hidden his global ambitions and has cited as his models global companies such as @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
in january at the @entity118 in @entity119 , he said his target was two billion @entity6 users worldwide , compared to 334 million ' active buyers ' in december , and a global version of @entity124 , the sales site that cemented his dominance in @entity5			2
some observers think @entity6 could one day rival the @entity130 online giants @entity131 and @entity132 , or just buy them			2
' many people think that 's a road that they may pursue , since it would be so expensive to build their own brand ( in the @entity130 ) , ' said @entity136 , vice-president of @entity137			2
' simply making a name for yourself in a market where the leaders have been established for a long time is going to be difficult			0
' it is more likely that @entity6 conquers emerging markets with still nascent online trade while prudently strengthening its presence in developed countries			0
' the head of @entity12 it industry group @entity149 , @entity148 , said about @entity6 that ' the success is impressive , even if it is in large part because suppliers face a very large , hungry @entity5 market '			0
asked whether it could become a true global player , he said : ' i think we will have to see			0
someone who can operate successfully in a large domestic market is not necessarily a good exporter ... it really depends on the individual solutions			0
' the @entity5 giant has already launched an online auction site in the @entity130 , called 11main , challenged @entity132 in the field of cloud computing with a service called @entity167 , and invested $ 200 million ( 188 million euros ) in @entity168 , a photo - sharing application			0
@entity171 , @entity172 - based analyst for the consultancy @entity137 , said it was an early attempt by @entity6 to try to ' understand digital consumers on a worldwide scale , outside of @entity5 '			0
last september , the @entity178 - based group raised a massive $ 25 billion on the @entity180 stock market , although the share price has since fallen below the listing price			0
founded in 1999 , @entity6 has based its success on @entity124 -- ' look for treasure ' in @entity185 -- and @entity186 , a gigantic virtual mall that has become so dominant that even @entity132 has opened up shop there			0
like @entity54 , @entity6 capitalises on the analysis of user data			0
it does not charge commission to individuals but derives its profits from advertising options it offers to improve their visibility			0
the volume of annual trade carried on its platforms , still mostly within @entity5 , exceeds that of @entity131 and @entity132 combined			0
@entity6 operates its own online payment system @entity6 , and has received approval from @entity172 to open a private bank			1
it also offers a navigation system , an online tour operator , and a music streaming service , among other things			1
' @entity6 is not only an e-commerce platform , it is the largest digital ecosystem in @entity5 , ' said @entity171			0
' wherever you are in @entity5 , @entity6 actually knows your behaviour			0
' but @entity6 still faces other challenges -- it has been accused of not doing enough to eliminate counterfeits sold on its platforms			0
if @entity6 wants to internationalise , said @entity217 , analyst at the consultancy @entity218 , ' the number one concern is that people buy something that 's actually worth their money			0
