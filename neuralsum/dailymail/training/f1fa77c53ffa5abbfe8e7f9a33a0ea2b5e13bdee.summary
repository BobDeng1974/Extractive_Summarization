by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 31 july 2013 the @entity1 could have a slow - motion camera , according to even more rumours about @entity5 's upcoming handset			1
code hidden inside @entity5 ’s @entity8 software suggests that the next @entity9 could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames - per - second ( @entity13 ) rather than around 30 frames per second			1
this is fast enough to allow @entity9 users to create slow - motion films			1
code hidden inside @entity5 's @entity8 software suggests that the next generation @entity9 could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames - per - second , enabling users to capture slow - motion video according to testing undertaken by @entity26 the feature named ‘ mogul ’ allows @entity9 to capture video at an ' exceptionally precise rate			1
' the resolution at which the @entity31 video could be recorded at is currently unclear			2
they did , however , find out that @entity24 would not activate on an @entity9 , which suggests that it is intended for a future @entity33			1
other action cameras , such as @entity36 ’s flagship @entity35 , already include a slow - motion mode			1
if the rumours are true , the addition could be a move by @entity5 to close the already narrowing gap between smartphones and cameras			0
video : an example of slow - motion video from a @entity35 based on the code , @entity26 believes the feature would be an option - like @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 - in the @entity8 software			1
recent speculation has also been mounting about a fingerprint sensor following a string of code discovered in the same beta release			0
the code describes a user touching the home button with their thumb			0
frame rate is also known as frame frequency			0
it is the rate at which a video camera can record consecutive images - called frames			1
it also applies to computer graphics and motion capture devices			2
frame rate is most often listed in frames per second ( @entity13 ) but can also be as expressed as hertz ( @entity76 )			2
the human eye processes around 10 to 12 separate images , or frames , per second and is able to distinguish each frame individually			0
early silent films had a frame rate from 14 to 24 fps which recorded motion , but was jerky			1
nowadays , motion pictures use 24 frames per second			2
shooting at a slower frame rate increases how fast the motion is when projected because the eye sees it moving quicker than in real life , and quicker than it can make out the individual frames			1
anything filmed at a higher rate of 24 fps appears slowed down because more frames are captured per second than the eye sees so it takes longer for the images to appear in full			0
a fingerprint then appears on the screen that changes colour			0
the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone , or to authorise payments in the @entity105 and prevent people from stealing your phone and obtaining personal data			0
the current trend in the rise of video sharing has been boosted by apps such as @entity114 , and features such as @entity52 on @entity115			0
@entity116 officially revealed its new video - sharing service for @entity115 during a product launch at the company 's @entity120 headquarters last month			2
the service added a video icon to the existing @entity115 app and users can record 15 - second video clips and edit them together for longer videos			1
@entity114 records six - second videos that can be embedded into tweets because the app is owned by @entity130			0
the developer code suggests the fingerprint scanner could be built into the phone 's home button , pictured			0
a supply chain source in @entity136 told @entity137 that @entity5 was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor , and this may be causing production problems			0

the next @entity9 could offer video recording at 120 frames - per - second
this is exceptionally fast and will allow users to create slow - motion films
