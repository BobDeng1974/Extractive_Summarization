this was @entity2 ’s big audition to the @entity4 public			1
could the young @entity5 survive out there on a cold , dank and rainy november night on @entity7 ? granted he was on the ‘ wrong ’ side of the divide so to speak , taking to the hallowed @entity11 turf instead of his future home at @entity13 , but the 19 - year - old @entity5 knew this was his opportunity to shine with the eyes of all @entity4 supporters on him – not to mention those of his soon - to - be - rivals			2
a goal for @entity21 against @entity22 on thursday , helping @entity23 to knock some of the stuffing out of the @entity22 ’ so - far promising @entity26 campaign , and immediately he would have been a hero in the @entity29 side of this football - loving city			1
@entity2 failed to shine in the blue half of @entity7 as he was kept at bay by @entity22 's defence @entity21 , pictured with @entity35 , could not find a way of beating @entity22 goalkeeper @entity37 follow all the latest # @entity26 action on : @entity39 : @entity40 @entity41 : @ @entity42 and at @entity43 for @entity4 fans are crying out for a striker to love right now – and @entity21 hopes to be that man , but he unfortunately is not yet ready to fill such big , pressurised boots just yet			1
having been deprived of the free - scoring @entity48 since the beginning of september , @entity4 ’s trio of replacement strikers – @entity52 , @entity53 and , of course , the mercurial @entity55 – have managed precisely zero @entity57 goals between them this season			2
@entity60 took a calculated gamble on signing @entity55 from @entity62 for £ 16million in the summer and , as of yet , that roll of the dice has not landed favourably			2
but @entity55 is only one of two strikers signed by the @entity4 boss this summer – @entity21 was snapped up from @entity23 for £ 10m but immediately loaned back to the @entity68 side			1
a star of the @entity70 – displacing @entity22 ’s £ 28m forward @entity71 in the @entity5 side for the latter stages – @entity21 was seen as a shrewd buy			1
@entity22 ace @entity75 kept a close eye on @entity5 international @entity21 during the @entity26 encounter @entity21 competes for the ball with @entity22 full back @entity79 at @entity11 yet @entity60 took the decision to loan him back , deeming him not - yet - ready to lead @entity4 ’s line in the heated battle of the @entity57			1
and it was @entity71 who won the battle of the @entity5 strikers in the @entity26			2
the @entity22 striker was more involved and influenced play far more than his young rival			0
to be fair on @entity21 though , he was not helped by his team - mates ’ hapless display at @entity11			2
@entity23 were inept in almost every possible way			0
@entity94 boss @entity60 is keeping a close eye on @entity21 ’s progress , having told @entity97 that he is monitoring each and every one of the @entity5 ’s game – and he is almost certain to have seen his display at @entity11 and come to the conclusion that he was vindicated in his decision			1
as @entity60 says , there is a lot for which @entity21 can ‘ improve ’ on			1
he is raw , there is no doubt about that			0
@entity21 is not the most prolific striker in the world – he is not going to challenge @entity110 and @entity111 for @entity114 football ’s @entity112 anytime soon – but he has bagged four goals already this season in 10 starts ( plus three substitute appearances ) , showing he can find the back of the net			2
@entity4 loanee @entity21 played the full 90 minutes against @entity22 but failed to have an impact on the scoreline @entity21 ( right ) celebrates with @entity124 after scoring against @entity125 at the @entity126 the 10 - cap @entity5 needs to develop and grow into his own , that much is clear , but he is no mug and he is no shrinking violet			1
it may take him time to adapt to @entity133 football but , on the basis of this performance , there are positives			0
he put his 6ft 1in frame around and , although he weakly diverted a header towards @entity37 in the first half , he did cause @entity142 some problems down the left			0
thursday night was a key night in his development and he will come through it a better player			0
he ran tirelessly for a cause in which his team - mates gave him precious little to work with			0
it was painful at times watching him run down another terrible long ball , launched into @entity153 with no godly hope of @entity21 being able to get a hold of it and launch a meaningful attack			0
pushed off the ball too easily by @entity75 on occasion , he came back in the second half and had already by that stage started to put his body on the line and show his own strength			0
he also displayed some lovely touches on the ball , he ran his heart out for the cause and he now knows what it is like to play in front of @entity4 ’s closest rivals			0
@entity21 is certainly not the finished product yet but come next summer @entity55 in particular better beware – he may be displaced in @entity60 ’ thinking by a young but upwardly - mobile @entity5			1
@entity174 not getting carried away with @entity114 performances follow all the latest # @entity26 action on @entity39 : @entity41 and at @entity43			0
