@entity0 stares at the ground and rarely looks up for half an hour			1
conversations about the kidnap and murder of his youngest brother are a dreadful necessity in his life			2
‘ things must change , ’ he says			0
‘ we have to deal with these gangs			1
’ and that is why he talks			0
he speaks slowly and quietly to a translator			0
across a long and painful discussion with @entity17 , he will relive the nightmare of @entity20 ’s kidnapping by gangs in @entity22 in 2007 , the failed ransom exchange , the silence and the discovery of @entity20 ’s body 19 months later			1
@entity0 took time to speak to @entity17 about the kidnapping ordeal that changed his life @entity0 ' brother was taken in 2007 , and later murdered by a gang of kidnappers he will also reveal for the first time that this ordeal was followed by a second kidnapping , when his sister - in - law and two nephews were taken hostage for a week in 2012			1
‘ there was no ransom paid that time , ’ he says			1
‘ the police were getting close and we got my sister - in - law and nephews back after a week			1
’ he adds : ‘ it is uncomfortable to talk about but i must because i want people to understand			0
’ the gang situation in @entity22 is critical and @entity0 believes the terrible details of stories like his – awfully common in @entity22 – can help spread awareness and draw support			1
it is why he has requested this interview and why he has joined @entity55 ’s campaign to lure the teenagers of his homeland away from gangs and into coffee farming			1
@entity0 moved to @entity60 in 2007 , playing first for @entity61 , and then latterly for @entity62 ( pictured ) the @entity22 footballer has not only had to deal with one kidnapping - in 2012 his sister - in - law and two nephews were also taken for a fortnight ‘ i lived in @entity65 and there is a gang there – 18th @entity67 - which is very active and one of the biggest gangs in @entity70 , ’ he says			1
‘ a lot of my friends ended up being part of it			0
they ended up there because there were no opportunities for these young people			0
no work , or hope - nothing			2

@entity0 says : ‘ lots of my friends from school ended up like this			2
they had either been forced to join a gang or did it voluntarily because there was no other opportunity for them			0
a lot of them are dead now			0

‘ i had a stable , middle - class family			2
my father was a factory manager and my mother was a teacher			0
and i had football as a passion and possibility			2
if i did n’t it might have gone differently			0
