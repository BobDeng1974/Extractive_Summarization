a volunteer on a charity sanitation project in @entity2 almost died after tapeworms burrowed into her brain			1
@entity5 , 40 , is thought to have picked up the worms from contaminated food or water			1
when she returned to @entity9 she began to suffer with intense headaches that developed into frequent seizures , but doctors were baffled by her condition			1
eventually , a consultant neurosurgeon diagnosed neurocysticercosis , a rare condition in which a person becomes infested with pork tapeworm			1
@entity5 , 40 , is thought to have picked up the worms from contaminated food or water - they caused her to suffer headaches and seizures the worms get into the intestine and migrate to the muscles and brain where they form cysts			1
in ms @entity5 ’s case , she was found to have larvae in her brain that were the size of a 5p coin			1
‘ we were working with children and there was nowhere for them to wash their hands , ’ said ms @entity5 , an information officer with @entity34 , @entity35			1
‘ when i got home , i started having headaches but did not really realise anything was wrong with me			2
‘ then i started to have seizures			2
they were passed off as panic attacks			0
‘ i was having four or five seizures a day			2
i went to my doctor who looked into my right eye			0
part of it was black because of the swelling			0
doctors initially thought she had a brain tumour or hiv before tropical medicine specialists got to the bottom of the problem			1
she is pictured volunteering in @entity2 where she picked up the worms ‘ i was sent for a scan			0
at first , it was thought i had tumours			2
it was a miracle how well i was doing given how much of my brain was swollen			2
’ ms @entity5 was sent from @entity63 to the @entity64 to see a neurological specialist			1
he reassured her that she did not have a brain tumour but suggested that it could be @entity53 or @entity69			1
eventually , however , tropical medicine experts diagnosed her with neurocysticercosis			1
the worm ( pictured ) caused sacs containing parasite larvae to form in her brain - these were cured with a worming tablet she said : ‘ that was after three weeks which was a really frightening time			1
‘ i was so unwell			0
my brain was not working and i was traumatised by the whole ordeal			2
‘ it was a long time before i could sleep because i was worried i would not wake up again			0
’ ms @entity5 , of @entity82 , @entity35 , says that she was strangely relieved to be told that she had tapeworm as it meant she could be cured			1
she said : ‘ the larvae in my brain were about the size of a 5p which was why it was causing me a problem			1
‘ the doctors gave me a worming tablet which kills the larvae			1
’ it is a infection caused by the larval cysts of the pork tapeworm - these are sacs containing the immature parasites			1
these cysts can affect various parts of the body - when they form in the brain it is known as neurocysticercosis			1
when the brain is affected it can cause seizures and can be fatal			1
the condition is caught by eating the microscopic eggs excreted by a person who has an intestinal pork tapeworm			2
for example , if a person eats undercooked , infected pork and develops a tapeworm they can excrete eggs and may contaminate food or surfaces by not washing their hands properly			2
once inside the body , the eggs hatch and the larvae find their way to the brain			2
however , ms @entity5 ’s ordeal was not to end there			2
her body reacted badly to the treatment and her arms , legs , and back swelled			1
she was given steroids to deal with the side effects and anti-epilepsy drugs stopped her fitting			2
making a full recovery has taken her two years			0
‘ i had a lot of anxiety , ’ she said			0
‘ i do n’t know if that was from the damage to the brain or from the trauma of the experience			0
‘ i had problems which are often associated with a brain injury			0
i could not switch off from sound and was over-sensitive to noise			0
‘ i remember coming back home from hospital and sitting in the garden thinking it would be relaxing			0
‘ it was overwhelming , horrendous			0
it is quite common to lose the sound filters			0
‘ when i went back to the office i had no filter at all			0
i could hear all the voices , the photocopier , everything			0
i just sat at my desk and cried			0
‘ i could also not make decisions			0
i could do logic puzzles but if someone asked me to make a decision about the smallest thing , it would throw me into a panic			0
‘ my concentration would waiver			0
it was obvious to other people i was different but i was oblivious			0
’ in hindsight , ms @entity5 wishes she had had the support of an organisation like @entity35 , which cares for survivors of brain injuries , so she is now raising money for the charity .			1

@entity5 , 40 , caught pork tapeworms from contaminated food or water
she experienced headaches and seizures when she returned to @entity9
doctors thought she may be suffering with a brain tumour , *tb* or even @entity53
finally diagnosed with neurocysticercosis - brain cysts caused by larvae
was then given worming tablet to kill larvae but reacted badly to medication
needed to take steroids , anti-epileptic drugs and took 2 years to recover
