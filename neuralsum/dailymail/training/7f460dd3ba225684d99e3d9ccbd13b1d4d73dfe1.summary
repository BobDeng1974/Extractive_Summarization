we 're all either guilty of it or have a friend who does it : oversharing on social networking sites			0
and it could be ruining your relationships offline			0
but while oversharing comes in many guises ( the loved - up status updates , the endless baby / cat / food photos , the relentless check - ins ) , there 's one method of keeping @entity15 abreast of your life that is driving us to all tears quicker than any other : the selfie			2
it 's a method of communication on @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 beloved of celebrities including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
but sharing too many photographs of your own face or body on @entity36 's media channel could be detrimental to your relationships with friends , colleagues and even your family , according to a @entity42 study			0
bajan singer @entity27 ca n't get enough of the selfie , but has found herself in hot water after posting self - portraits in risque situations , such as half - naked in bed with ex-boyfriend @entity48 , or smoking suspicious - looking cigarettes @entity54 @entity53 model @entity29 is famous for her selfies , most of which involve her dressing up in wacky fancy dress outfits , pulling silly faces and raising one of her legendarily bushy eyebrows how the quantity and subject matter of the pictures you upload onto @entity22 impacts upon your real - world relationships was researched at the @entity66 , the @entity67 , the @entity68 and @entity69 , in a project appropriately titled @entity71			1
the researchers found that an increased level of sharing photos of the self prompted a decreased level of support - in terms of ' likes ' garnered - from friends and colleagues			0
@entity30 uses @entity23 mainly to post photographs of her two babies , @entity82 and @entity83 , but occasionally she steps in for a slice of the action one direction star @entity28 is always updating his @entity23 feed with snaps of himself with bandmates , famous friends and adoring fans commenting on the findings that excessive selfie - sharing may damage relationships , lead author of the report dr @entity95 , a lecturer in marketing at @entity97 , said : ' our research found that those who frequently post photographs on @entity22 risk damaging real - life relationships			1
' this is because people , other than very close friends and relatives , do n't seem to relate well to those who constantly share photos of themselves			1
' it 's worth remembering that the information we post to our ' friends ' on @entity22 , actually gets viewed by lots of different categories of people : partners ; friends ; family ; colleagues and acquaintances ; and each group seems to take a different view of the information shared			0
' the study , fully entitled @entity71 ? disclosure and liking in @entity22 , also found that young women were the most likely to find support in the form of ' likes ' on @entity22			2
older users and men received less support when they shared online			0
young @entity133 singer @entity132 is the ultimate selfie - taker , and rarely a minute goes by in which we are n't informed what this chap is wearing , eating or doing mrs @entity138 , model @entity138 , has the sort of face most of us would probably be selfie - ing all the live - long day , were it ours instead ... supermodel @entity142 , pictured right with comedian @entity143 , is an ardent selfie - poster , probably because she enjoys having control over the camera and the editing room for a change we 've seen enough celebrity selfies on @entity23 to last us well into the next millennium ...			1
and it seems even they are tiring of their grinning mugs			0
so famous fans of the self - portrait snap have swapped faces for posteriors , and are currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance ... in the form of the bottom - selfie			1
@entity142 got the # belfie movement kick - started with this cheeky ( sorry ) picture of her beach bum well , if you had @entity27 's bottom would n't you do a # belfie ? @entity142 and @entity27 have spearheaded the movement for posting photographs of sandy , bikini - clad bottoms on social networking sites , as @entity172 of @entity173 reported			1
other illustrious fans of the rear - view shot include @entity179 and made in @entity181 's @entity180			0
so ... would you ? best pals @entity27 , left , and @entity29 ca n't resist pinching each other 's bottoms and then telling everyone about it on @entity23 @entity187 , left , and made in @entity181 's @entity180 , right , show their @entity23 fans how to recognise them if they 're ever stuck behind them in a queue			2

celebrities @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity28 love selfies
