by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 4 june 2013 a new smartphone app could finally solve the scourge of abandoned trolleys and the damage they cause to the @entity8 countryside			1
the @entity9 app - available for @entity11 and @entity13 devices - lets users send photos of abandoned trolleys along with their gps locations to a national collection service			1
one of 47 local @entity9 vans can then be sent to the location within 24 hours to recover the trolley and return it to nearby supermarkets - saving local authorities and retailers millions of pounds in clean - up costs each year			1
the photos and the gps coordinates are then sent to a national collection service , which sends a van within 24 hours to recover and return the trolley to nearby supermarkets according to @entity9 , more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the @entity8 - around 1.5 million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year			1
many end up on wasteland , housing estates , parks , railways or water ways and are dangerous to wildlife and children			0
@entity47 from @entity48 said : ' we have a national treasure of canals in this country , but they 're often blighted by fly - tipped trolleys			0
' they 're an eyesore , but also they 're a danger to boats and the ecology of the canal			0
' furthermore they make the canals just look unloved			0
' his company has been working with @entity9 for three years to help deal with the problem in the ' most efficient manner			0
' the @entity9 app is free and is available on @entity11 and @entity13 devices			1
the company has 47 collection teams in vans across the country that can respond to abandoned trolley reports			2
users can specify a location , shown in the right - hand screen grab , or use @entity78 to automatically locate them according to @entity9 more than half of all shopping trolleys in service in the @entity8 - around one million - go missing from supermarket car parks each year			2
many end up on wasteland , housing estates , parks , railways or water ways there are around two million trolleys in operation in the @entity8 at any one time			0
around 1.5 million trolleys are taken from supermarket car parks each year			0
many are abandoned in wasteland , parks , waterways and housing estates			0
@entity9 has 47 collection teams that pick up around 400,000 trolleys a year			2
according to @entity47 , if all the trolleys recovered were stacked on top of one another , they would be taller than @entity104			0
local authorities , retailers and environmental charities spend millions of pounds each year returning trolleys to supermarket car parks			1
local authorities are currently responsible for rounding up abandoned trolleys			1
they then charge some of the repatriation back to the supermarkets , often by way of fines			0
these costs are passed onto consumers through increased council tax bills and higher food prices			1
the new @entity9 system , which is backed by all the major supermarkets including @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , lets consumers ' take control of a more rapid and joined - up clean - up			1
' a @entity125 's spokesperson told @entity130 : ' all our stores want to be a good neighbour so we work with @entity9 to ensure any abandoned trolleys are quickly collected			1
' we hope other retailers will follow our lead in recognising their responsibilities to the communities they serve and sign up to this scheme			0
' @entity140 , managing director of @entity9 said : ' we have made a substantial impact in managing the abandoned trolley challenge , with @entity143 retrieving almost one million trolleys since 2012			1
the @entity9 has three main sections - a welcome screen , a @entity148 function that lets users send abandoned trolley locations to a national collection service , and a stats page that shows the users how many trolleys they 're reported and where they found them ' however , we want to eliminate the problem altogether and return pride to our local communities			1
' the app makes it very easy for people to report trolleys quickly and accurately			0
' for every trolley collected by @entity9 , the team donates to independent charity @entity163			1
the campaign hopes to raise enough money to plant at least 2,000 new trees in @entity168 € ™ s urban areas each year , the equivalent of taking almost 150 cars off the @entity8 roads			0
@entity140 continued : ' by swapping abandoned trolleys for trees , we want to make a positive impact on communities			2
'' a graphic from @entity9 explaining the enviornmental impact of abandoned trolleys @entity179 , ceo of @entity163 , added : ' we often come across abandoned trolleys as part of our tree - planting work in local communities			1
' we hear from our volunteers that there is confusion about how to report them and whose responsibility it is to pick them up			0
' @entity189 re delighted that @entity9 has launched this app to make the process so simple			2
' as well as being eyesores , abandoned trolleys can cause environmental damage			2
local authorities are currently responsible for recovering trolleys and returning them to supermarkets			2
this can costs both councils and retailers money and these costs are then passed onto consumers through council tax and food price rises @entity9 launched in 2006 to help reduce the impact abandoned trolleys have on the local environment , said @entity140 : ' because when they get abandoned there 's a big drain on the local councils and on retailers to try and collect the trolleys and put them back into service			1
' he said that trolleys can end up in many places and the company had even recovered a trolley from on top of a bus stop			0

for each trolley recovered a donation is made to the @entity163 charity
