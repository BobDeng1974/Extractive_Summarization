by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 offered $ 80billion to buy @entity4 , but was rebuffed by the company 's board of directors , it has been revealed today the 83 - year - old @entity8 billionaire has his eye on the media conglomerate , which owns @entity11 , @entity10 , @entity12 , among other big - name media properties			1
experts say he is n't likely to give up after one rejection			0
the move could create a mega-sized media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular tv shows and thousands of films , as well as cable tv networks and local broadcast tv channels			0
such a company would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate with cable companies and internet service providers			0
@entity27 for them : @entity3 , the owner of @entity29 , is expected to ratchet up pressure on @entity4 until the company sells @entity29 offered $ 85 per share in cash and stock for @entity4 , a source familiar with the situation told @entity0			1
@entity4 's stock skyrocketed nearly 18percent early wednesday to more than $ 84 a share after the @entity38 broke the news			0
both sides confirmed that it had made the formal proposal to @entity4 last month			0
' the @entity4 board of directors declined to pursue our proposal			0
we are not currently in any discussions with @entity4 , ' @entity29 said in a statement on wednesday			1
on wednesday morning , @entity4 issued a statement explaining why it had rejected the bid			2
it listed several reasons - though most revolved around the idea that @entity4 's companies were worth more than @entity3 had bid			1
' the @entity52 is confident that continuing to execute its strategic plan will create significantly more value for the @entity56 and its stockholders and is superior to any proposal that @entity29 is in a position to offer , ' the board of directors said in a statement			0
@entity61 first approached @entity4 , owner of the @entity12 movie studio and cable channels such as @entity10 and @entity11 , in early june and delivered a formal takeover proposal later that month , the @entity38 reported , citing people familiar with the matter			1
@entity29 , which owns movie studio @entity68 and cable news channel @entity69 , offered to sell @entity11 as part of its proposal to buy @entity4 to clear any regulatory hurdles , the @entity38 said			1
the price of @entity4 shares skyrocketed on wednesday morning after news of the bid broke - jumping to more than $ 84 a share at one point ' i think fair public value is $ 82			2
( it ) would be good deal for @entity29 if it goes through @entity85 ( regulators ) with @entity11 sales , ' @entity82 analyst @entity81 told @entity0 in an email			2
@entity4 's board discussed the proposal at length and sent a terse letter rejecting the offer earlier this month , saying that it was better off remaining independent , the newspaper said			0
it said the deal fell through because the stock portion of @entity29 's offer consisted of non-voting shares			0
@entity29 had estimated that a combined company would save $ 1 billion in costs and possibly more , primarily by cutting sales staff and back - office functions , the paper said			2
the combined company 's revenue would be over $ 60 billion			0
@entity29 is in the middle of a reorganization of its television business as the network seeks to lift itself out of last place among the big @entity111 broadcasters			0
the shakeup of @entity3 's @entity29 's tv units also comes a year after the film and tv company was spun off from @entity3 's @entity116 , which now operates publishing assets , including the @entity118 , the @entity119 , the @entity120 and @entity121 in @entity122 and dozens of newspaper in @entity8			1
@entity29 is being advised by @entity125 and @entity126 , while @entity4 has hired @entity127 and other advisers , the paper said			2
@entity4 owns several major tv stations and movie studios			1
its properties - in addition to @entity11 - include : @entity133 , @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
those assets would improve an impressive stable of media and entertainment properties already owned by @entity29 , including : @entity68 movie studios , @entity69 , local @entity29 tv stations in 18 markets , @entity147 and the @entity148			1
@entity4 once owned @entity149 , the second - largest cable provider in the country , magazine publisher @entity152 , and @entity153 - though all three were spun off into independent companies .			2

@entity29 , owner of @entity69 , would sell off @entity11 to avoid *anti-trust* *problems*
@entity4 also owns @entity10 , @entity133 , @entity12 , @entity137 and @entity159 - among other properties
@entity3 is determined to buy the company and will likely make another bid , experts say
