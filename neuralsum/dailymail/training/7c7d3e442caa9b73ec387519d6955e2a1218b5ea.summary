in an act of ' thuggish behaviour that had the most tragic consequences , ' mr @entity12 died after cracking his head on the pavement when @entity11 delivered the fatal blow , the court heard			1
lighting expert @entity12 had been celebrating his 32nd birthday when he was attacked outside a kebab shop in @entity25 , south east @entity26 the jury was told @entity28 , 33 , and two pals then ran off leaving his victim for dead , and bragged to some girls : ' i 've just beaten someone up			1
look at my knuckles ! ' mr @entity12 , who also worked on @entity37 pop music quiz show @entity35 , never regained consciousness after the incident in @entity25 , south east @entity26 , and was pronounced dead an hour later			1
@entity11 handed himself into a police station the next day , but claimed it was a friend who attacked mr @entity12			1
@entity43 , prosecuting , told @entity44 : ' we suggest all the evidence will show that this defendant murdered a man he did n’t even know during an unnecessary attack			0
' this was n’t a fight , it was a beating , putting a man down who was effectively defenceless			0
' although he may regret it now , in the seconds that mattered , this defendant , in drink and anger , intended to hurt @entity12 and hurt him badly , and that is exactly what he did			2
' @entity61 pictures in the @entity63 kebab shop shop shortly before @entity12 was attacked mr @entity43 added : ' shortly before 1am in the early hours of sunday october 16 , 2011 , this defendant , @entity11 , was coming to the end of a long night 's drinking in @entity67			1
' he was at the local kebab shop when , for the first and only time in his life , he came across @entity12 , a 32 - year - old man who had also been out in @entity25			1
' saturday october 15 was mr @entity12 ’s birthday and he had spent the evening with his brother @entity71 and a group of his friends celebrating			1
' up to that point there is no suggestion that mr @entity12 or anyone else in his group had caused any trouble or done anything to draw attention to themselves			1
the parents of @entity12 , @entity84 and @entity85 , at @entity44 as they attended the trial of @entity11 ' @entity12 had already got his takeaway			2
he began to knock on the window of the restaurant to tell his brother where he was or to hurry up			0
the defendant decided to take exception to mr @entity12 and spoke to him about banging on the window			1
' a brief argument then developed between them which almost unbelievably led to the defendant attacking and killing @entity12 , who was a complete stranger to him			0
' the prosecutor said witnesses saw @entity11 land ' heavy blows ' on mr @entity12 at least twice outside @entity63 kebab shop			1
he continued : ' the first punch knocked mr @entity12 to the ground			1
the defendant then walked away across the road and at that moment in time , he had more than taken care of himself			0
in fact he was telling mr @entity110 to sit down meaning , " stay down "			0
' unfortunately mr @entity12 , who was now dazed , got himself up and started to follow the defendant			2
' rather than just ignore mr @entity12 or walk away and leave the scene , this defendant decided to hit him again			2
' in the second part of the attack he delivered a punch that was hard enough to knock mr @entity12 out cold and cause terrible head injuries as he went back , his head cracking against the road surface			2
' despite emergency medical attention , mr @entity12 never came round and he was pronounced dead just over an hour later at 2.26am			2
' mr @entity43 told the court @entity11 could have easily walked away rather than hitting mr @entity12 a second time			1
he said : ' despite having laid out mr @entity12 , including seeing and hearing his head hit the pavement , he made no attempt to stay and help the injured man			2
instead , he fled from the scene with two friends who he had been drinking with that evening			0
' far from showing concern or remorse , his attitude moments afterwards was to boast about what he had done			0
' he was pleased with himself			0
once he had got away from the immediate vicinity , he saw some girls and said something like , " alright girls , i 've just smashed someone up - or beaten someone up - look at my knuckles "			0
' he held up the hand he had used to kill @entity110			0
' in all , his actions amounted to thuggish behaviour , random street violence that had the most tragic consequences			0
' @entity11 , of @entity145 , south east @entity26 , denies murder			1
