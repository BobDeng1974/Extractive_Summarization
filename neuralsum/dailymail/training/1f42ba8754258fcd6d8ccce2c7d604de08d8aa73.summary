with women obliged to sit yards behind chairs reserved exclusively for men , the photograph below shows the shocking reality of gender segregation at a @entity8 university			1
it was taken earlier this year at a training course at @entity11 organised by its @entity12			1
the course was entitled @entity14 and it featured a guest speaker from a hardline @entity12 group			1
@entity17 of campaign group @entity19 , which monitors campus extremism , said : ‘ the obvious discrimination in this picture is what segregated seating can mean in practice – women pushed to the back of the hall , while men are given the best seats to see and hear the speaker			2
’ picture exclusive : women and men sit separately at a day - long seminar at @entity11 earlier this year - which was about how to ' talk to non @entity35 about @entity36 convincingly and in a structured way ' the disturbing image emerged at the end of a week in which @entity40 – the vice-chancellors ’ association – backed down from guidelines it had previously given that apparently allowed campus @entity12 societies to impose segregated seating at meetings			1
the guidelines have been withdrawn while @entity40 consults with the @entity50 about the appropriate position			2
it is expected to be forced to back down permanently			0
a recent report by @entity19 found that over a quarter of visits by @entity12 speakers to @entity8 universities resulted in segregated meetings			1
last week the controversy over gender segregation prompted the prime minister to intervene			2
mr @entity62 said : ‘ i ’m absolutely clear that there should not be segregated audiences for visiting speakers to universities in @entity8			1
that is not the right approach , the guidance should say that universities should not allow this			2
’ the @entity11 event in february was billed as a ‘ @entity70 ’			1
@entity71 is the word @entity35 use to mean ‘ preaching ’ or ‘ invitation to @entity36 ’			0
inequality : the women sit at the back , left , while the men are given the best seats closest to the front , right defence : guest speaker @entity81 said : ' separate seating for men and women is not something we ever enforce			1
it happens naturally and if @entity35 women were disadvantaged they would be the first to complain ' it was held on a sunday in the oak - panelled @entity91 and featured guest speaker @entity81 from the @entity93 and @entity94 ( @entity95 )			2
mr @entity81 said : ‘ separate seating for men and women is not something we ever enforce			1
‘ it happens naturally and if @entity35 women were disadvantaged they would be the first to complain			0
they are forthright , not meek and mild as those who do not understand @entity36 assume			0
‘ this photo must have been taken at the start of the meeting because by the end there were many more women at the talk			0
‘ we have consulted with @entity108 and the @entity50 to ensure that we stay within the law and we do this by providing a mixed seating area for those who prefer this			0
‘ i think @entity62 has failed to do his homework			0
he is trying to make capital out of a problem that is n’t there			0
’ criticised : the training course on @entity36 preaching happened in february at the @entity11 soon after this photograph was taken , the @entity95 was barred from @entity122 for segregating seating at a debate over the existence of @entity126			1
several of its leading figures have a history of making intolerant comments against free speech and in favour of brutal punishments for homosexuals and ‘ fornicators ’			0
@entity95 was invited back to @entity11 a month after the @entity14 course for a debate called @entity138 ? photographs of that event emerged showing signs pointing males ( brothers ) and females ( sisters ) to different entrances			1
it prompted the university authorities to investigate after they were alerted that its own @entity12 boasted of operating ‘ a strict policy of segregated seating between males and females ’			2
at the time , university officials insisted that they did not permit enforced segregation and there would be ‘ no recurrence ’			0
brothers and sisters : the picture comes after this sign was put up at a public lecture hosted by the @entity11 's @entity12 society , which academic authorities said they would investigate last night there was no comment from @entity11 ’s @entity12			1
a spokesman for the university said : ‘ the university expects all persons to respect its commitment to freedom of speech , its good name and reputation and to be sensitive to the feelings of all sections of its diverse community			0
‘ we will be in discussions with @entity40 following their most recent statement to clarify the impact of their legal advice			0

photograph was taken earlier this year at a @entity11 seminar
the same @entity12 society came under fire for ' brothers and sisters ' sign
universities @entity8 has backed down from guidelines which allow segregation
speaker at the event : ' separate seating is not something we ever enforce '
