by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 06:14 est , 27 july 2012 when he was just 19 years old , doctors told @entity3 he would never see his 30th birthday			1
the 32 - stone teenager - who regularly downed over 20 pints of bitter in the pub over an evening - had just broken a pair of weighing scales			2
doctors told him he would be eligible for gastric band surgery and a tummy tuck on the @entity12 , but the @entity14 biscuit factory worker , now 22 , determined to lose the weight without anyone 's help , and declined the offer			1
half the man i was : @entity3 , who shed 16 stone , poses with the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink every night he spent the next three years working industriously to shed the weight , immediately cutting out takeaways and alcohol from his diet , then taking up weight training			1
but rather than miss out when his friends went to the pub , the previously morbidly obese teenager decided to swap the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink each night with just one solitary glass of orange squash			0
mr @entity3 said : ' i used to go out drinking with my mates every weekend - the most i ever drank was 24 pints in one night , but i ’d come close to that every time i went out			2
' and after a big night out , i ’d always have a kebab before i went home , and never thought anything of it			0
i work in a biscuit factory , moving around custard creams on the forklift trucks , so temptation was constantly in front of me			0
' i have no idea how much i actually weighed in at - the scales i had at home went up to 32 stone , but when i stood on them , they just read " error "			1
' now you see me , now you do n't : @entity3 aged 19 before losing the weight , left , and now , aged 22 and 16 stone lighter , right @entity3 managed to lose 16 stone - over half his body weight - all on his own			1
but he is now devastated because the @entity12 is allegedly refusing to pay for the removal of the layers of unsightly excess skin that the lost weight has left behind on his body			1
@entity3 said : ' i was really upset when i found out the @entity12 would have paid for me to have gastric surgery , but because i ’ve done that on my own , they now wo n’t help me			1
' i 've looked into funding the operation privately , but it ’s more than £ 10,000 - which is way more than i can afford			0
' i thought once i lost weight my confidence would improve - but it 's had the opposite effect			0
' a spokesman for @entity72 said : ' we can not comment on individual cases because of patient confidentiality			0
' however , we can say that @entity12 @entity72 does not routinely fund abdominoplasty surgery			2
where requests are received , the @entity77 will consider these on an exceptional basis			0
' there 's room in here for two ! super-dieter @entity3 with a pair of trousers belonging to his former , larger self whose round is it ? @entity3 pictured with the 24 pints he used to drink every night before changing his beverage of choice to orange squash			0

@entity3 , 22 , from @entity14 , weighed 32 stone when he was 19
@entity12 offered gastric band surgery but he *wanted* to lose the weight himself
now medics refusing to fund removal of his excess skin
