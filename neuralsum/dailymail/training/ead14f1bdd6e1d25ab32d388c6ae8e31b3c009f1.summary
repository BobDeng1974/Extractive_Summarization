by @entity0 a couple who got engaged during a hot air balloon ride have had a lucky escape after their romantic ride turned to terror when the balloon crashed			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were among seven passengers aboard a hot air balloon that crashed into live power lines in @entity13 , @entity14 on saturday night			1
@entity8 was overjoyed when his girlfriend of two - and - a - half years accepted his proposal and they posed happily for pictures as they soared over fields below			2
the couple - nor their 5 fellow passengers - did not sustain any injuries but the passengers were suddenly blinded by a huge explosion as they hit power lines , before the ripped balloon began descending amid billowing black smoke			1
a passerby happened to be filming the balloon when it hit the power lines - revealing the massive burst of light before the basket came down in a field			1
' i do n't know if it was wind conditions or what , ' @entity8 told @entity47			2
' we knew we were going down and we saw the power lines coming right at us			1
' when we hit , the pilot told us to get down			0
all we saw were sparks all around us , and felt the sparks			0
we were all in shock and fear			0
' caught on camera : a passerby was filming when the balloon struck the power lines , causing a burst of light blinding : after the explosion of light , the balloon deflated and fell to the ground in a cloud of black smoke despite the terrifying burst of light seen in the footage , there were no serious injuries			1
several homes and businesses in the area lost power because of the collision with the power lines			2
the balloon had departed from @entity79 church in @entity13 and went down in the area of 16th and @entity81			2
a small fire was reported at the scene and was quickly extinguished			0
fire officers later snapped an image of the deflated balloon on the grass in the open field , while the lucky couple pouted in front of the flames for another picture			0
moments before : the happy couple snapped this picture just before the balloon hit the power lines memories : they kept a fragment of the balloon to remember the harrowing but happy trip but @entity8 and @entity9 said they do n't consider the crash a bad omen - just a good story			1
' she wanted a story and she got one , ' @entity8 said			0
' especially after this , we 'll just keep it simple			0
' the @entity112 is investigating the cause of the crash , and the hot air balloon company , @entity116 of @entity117 , @entity14 , said that the incident is under review			1
