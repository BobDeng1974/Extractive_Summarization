@entity0 made in 1901 , 31 years after @entity2 ' death thought to have been inspired by @entity2 ' novel @entity3 by @entity5 published : 06:09 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 19:04 est , 9 march 2012 the oldest surviving film based on the works of @entity2 has been discovered			1
the @entity8 , inspired by @entity3 , dates back to march 1901 but lay unnoticed in an archive for decades			1
the minute - long clip , made by @entity12 film pioneer @entity11 , was given to the @entity13 in 1954 by a collector , but was catalogued under the wrong name and date			2
‘ it ’s wonderful to have discovered such a rare film so close to @entity2 ’s bicentennial , ’ she said			1
‘ not only does it survive , but it is the world ’s earliest dickensian film			0
it looks beautiful and is in excellent condition			0
' this really is the icing on the cake of our current celebration of @entity41			0
' the film beats the previous record holder , @entity44 ; or , @entity45 , by several months			0
it depicts the crossing - sweeper from @entity3 – played by @entity11 ’s wife @entity48 – being found by a nightwatchman as she freezes to death in the winter snow			1
discovered film : the severe - looking watchman appears to shoo @entity21 away as the snow falls around them suffering from the cold : ragged - looking @entity21 collapses and is caught just in time by the watchman tragic death : as he takes his final breaths , @entity21 holds his hands up in prayer to heaven landmark year : across the world people are marking the bicentenary of @entity2 the snow is falling heavily at night as @entity68 appears in tattered clothes against a churchyard wall , struggling against the cold			1
a watchman shoos him on , but then captures the boy just as he falls to the ground dying			0
the watchman holds @entity68 as the boy puts his hands together in prayer before taking his final breath			0
in @entity3 , @entity68 did not die in the snow , but rather died of pneumonia and was led in prayer before his death by a character called @entity84			1
however , the name ' poor @entity68 ' would have been recognisable to @entity86 audiences as he was such a popular character among readers from the time of the novel 's publication in 1853 and so it is thought likely the dickensian character was the inspiration for the film			2
crossing sweepers were a common sight in @entity98 and other large cities throughout much of the nineteenth century			0
their job was to sweep a path through the often dirty streets ahead of people – particularly the more affluent – for a small fee			0
@entity2 describes @entity68 as a homeless boy who ‘ fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels , the horses , whips , and umbrellas , and gets but a scanty sum ’			1
the film will be screened as a special late addition to the programme of @entity2 : pre- 1914 @entity117 this month at the @entity118 in @entity98 .			2
