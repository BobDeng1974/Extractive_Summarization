mr. @entity1 attended the @entity2 , in @entity3 , @entity4 , three times complaining of chest pain but was each time sent away without being properly investigated			1
@entity22 heard he died from a heart attack just eight days after his final visit to the practice on january 9 , 2012 complaining of indigestion			1
coroner @entity27 said the surgery 's lead gp , dr @entity28 , had agreed further tests should have been arranged - and at the very least it should have been arranged for mr @entity1 to go to the local hospital			1
however ' this , for whatever reason , was not done , ' said the coroner			0
the inquest heard how the practice nurse at the surgery carried out an @entity18 examination on mr @entity1			1
dr @entity14 admitted this showed an abnormality to mr. @entity1 's heart			2
his records also showed that both his parents and his two brothers had suffered heart problems			2

looking through the medical records i do not have any record he had had chest pains before			0
' mr @entity27 asked : ' did n't you think you should have asked for further tests to be conducted ? ' dr @entity14 said she would have checked the results of the blood tests carried out that day but did n't because she only worked at the surgery for three weeks			2
mr @entity1 's family later said staff at the surgery should be ' hung out to dry ' over his death she added she had n't spoken to the patient about his condition , she said the practice nurse had provided a ' very good history ' of what he had			1
the nurse had told her mr @entity1 had complained of chest pain three or four times a day			1
mr @entity27 replied : ' she is not a doctor			0
why not take two minutes to go and ask him ? ' dr @entity14 added that her opinion was that the chest pain was caused by a lung disease identified at the post mortem as possibly mesothelioma ( cancer of the lining of the lung due to asbestos exposure )			1
the coroner said : ' i am recording a verdict of misadventure as the result of the failure to further investigate the @entity18 , given the family history and the chest pains about which he complained in november , on december 19 and on january 9			2
' mr. @entity1 's family later said staff at the surgery should be ' hung out to dry '			1

' ' i would still have done the same thing going by his history			0
