the first stars twinkled into life some 100 million years later than was previously thought , new research suggests			1
data from @entity6 's @entity5 space telescope indicates that star formation began about 550 million years after the @entity8 that gave birth to the universe			1
this is based on observing the universe 's earliest light , and it could alter our understanding of how the cosmos as we know it today came to be			2
@entity19 's @entity5 satellite has revealed the first stars were 100 million years younger than thought , nbased on data from the @entity5 satellite			1
shown is the interaction between interstellar dust in the @entity26 and the structure of our @entity29 ’s magnetic field , as detected by @entity6 's @entity5 satellite over the entire sky before the stars began to form , described as the ' reionisation ' epoch , the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light			1
@entity38 refers to the way energetic ultraviolet light from the first stars split hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons			2
the @entity8 13.8 billion years ago was when matter , space and even time exploded into existence			2
previously scientists had thought that the first stars began to shine 440 million years after the @entity8			1
the new results , still to be confirmed by further measurements , suggest that they are actually 100 million years younger			1
@entity5 , launched in 2009 , was designed to study the ' cosmic microwave background ' ( @entity52 ) - the faint radiation echo left by the @entity8 - with unprecedented accuracy			1
it was decommissioned in 2013 after exhausting its supply of liquid helium coolant			0
' according to @entity5 's observations , stars may be younger than believed , in bearing with other independent astrophysical indicators , and this finding may have major consequences on our attempts to understand the dark components of the universe , ' said senior scientist dr @entity66 , from the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			1
the ' dark components ' consist of invisible dark matter and dark energy , both of which are still unsolved mysteries whose natures are unknown			0
before the first stars began to form ( illustration shown ) , described as the ' reionisation ' epoch , the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light			1
@entity38 refers to the way energetic ultraviolet light from the first stars split hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons light is polarised when it vibrates in a preferred direction , something that may arise as a result of photons - the particles of light - bouncing off other particles			2
this is exactly what happened when the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) radiation originated in the early universe			0
initially , photons were trapped in a hot , dense soup of particles that , by the time the universe was a few seconds old , consisted mainly of electrons , protons and neutrinos			0
owing to the high density , electrons and photons collided with one another so frequently that light could not travel any significant distant before bumping into another electron , making the early universe extremely ‘ foggy ’			0
slowly but surely , as the cosmos expanded and cooled , photons and the other particles grew farther apart , and collisions became less frequent			0
this had two consequences : electrons and protons could finally combine and form neutral atoms without them being torn apart again by an incoming photon , and photons had enough room to travel , being no longer trapped in the cosmic fog			0
once freed from the fog , the light was set on its cosmic journey that would take it all the way to the present day , where telescopes like @entity5 detect it as the @entity52			2
but the light also retains a memory of its last encounter with the electrons , captured in its polarisation			0
the scientists , who report their findings in the journal @entity136 , said more @entity5 data was still to be analysed that should provide a clearer picture of the evidence			2
scientists from the @entity5 collaboration have published the results from the analysis of these data in a large number of scientific papers over the past two years , confirming the standard cosmological picture of our universe with ever greater accuracy			2
recently , data from @entity5 was used to discredit the @entity154 results , which had initially been thought to have found evidence for the cosmic inflation of the universe			1
' but there is more : the @entity52 carries additional clues about our cosmic history that are encoded in its ' polarisation ' , ' explains @entity162 , @entity6 's @entity5 project scientist			1
' @entity5 has measured this signal for the first time at high resolution over the entire sky , producing the unique maps released today			2
' this is a visualisation of the polarisation of the @entity52 , or @entity52 , as detected by @entity6 's @entity5 satellite			1

shown is an illustration of the satellite shown is a visualisation of the polarisation of the @entity52 , or @entity52 , as detected by @entity6 's @entity5 satellite on a small patch of the sky measuring 20º across @entity5 's polarisation data confirm the details of the standard cosmological picture determined from its measurement of the @entity52 temperature fluctuations , but add an important new answer to a fundamental question : when were the first stars born ? ' after the @entity52 was released , the universe was still very different from the one we live in today , and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form , ' explains dr @entity197 of @entity198 , @entity69			1
' @entity5 's observations of the @entity52 polarisation now tell us that these ' @entity201 ' ended some 550 million years after the @entity8 - more than 100 million years later than previously thought			1
' the @entity201 ended as the first stars began to shine			2
and as their light interacted with gas in the universe , more and more of the atoms were turned back into their constituent particles : electrons and protons			0
this key phase in the history of the cosmos is known as the ' epoch of reionisation '			0
dr @entity197 added : ' while these 100 million years may seem negligible compared to the universe 's age of almost 14 billion years , they make a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars			1
' in march last year , scientists believed they had glimpsed - for the first time - the rapid expansion of the universe just after the @entity8 , a theory called cosmic inflation			0
but since then , the @entity154 findings have been repeatedly called in to question , with many saying they did not show what they appeared to			0
and now the final nail has been put in the coffin , as new data this month revealed that the initial finding was due to the effects of dust in our galaxy - and not cosmic inflation			0
the latest revelations were made using data from @entity6 ’s @entity5 satellite			1
the findings were not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that @entity154 was correct			0
the initial results were made using an extremely sensitive detector on an @entity250 telescope			0
the team thought they had found a polarisation of light that would have proved the theory of cosmic inflation			0
to make sure the signal they were detecting was correct , the team subtracted the lensing effect of massive galaxies			0
but at the time , some scientists said the team had not correctly accounted for interstellar dust in our galaxy			0
and now , using data from the @entity5 satellite , which characterised dust in the galaxy , it seems this fear has been confirmed .			1

@entity19 's @entity5 satellite reveals the first stars were younger than thought
they now think they began to shine *540* million years after the @entity8
before they formed the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light
@entity5 also recently *disproved* results from the @entity154 *experiment*
the satellite was in operation from 2009 until 2013
