the bank , known as the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , was set up and is now run by children in the @entity10 neighbourhood of @entity11 , @entity4			1
the bank was established on the principle the children would make all the rules and decisions			1
show them how it 's done : street children queue up at the counter to deposit money at their very own bank deposit : children wait to deposit their earnings at the bank - called the @entity7 @entity26 volunteers from child rights organisation @entity27 , however , assist the day - to - day running of the bank and sort out any logistical issues			1
children aged nine to 18 can deposit anything from a couple of pence to one pound and get 3.5 percent on their deposits			1
they can then withdraw up to five pounds at a time			2
it is open seven days a week and is run by perhaps the youngest manger in the world - 13 - year - old @entity36			1
he said : ' i ran away from home and started working at a tea stall			2
then i met some volunteers who told me about the bank			2
now i go to school and i am the ( bank ) manager also			2

i can withdraw money when the need arises			0
' paperwork : four members show their pass books - which are needed to make a deposit pass book : information such as name and date of account opening is included in the document charity program manager at @entity27 , @entity105 , said : ' street children were telling us that they lose their money			1
or they tend to spend their money here and there			0
' so , we at @entity27 decided on the idea of operationalizing a bank for them			1
' they use their savings in the khazana ( bank ) to meet their future needs			2
' some of them use their money to go for higher education , or vocational training			0
some of them use it to start small business enterprises			0
' the charity also provides education , shelter and care for @entity11 's vulnerable children			1
future : it is hoped the members , two with passbooks pictured , learn life skills while staying at the shelter education : the @entity26 also runs classes for the children ( pictured ) and offers them shelter and food learning : many of the children were not in school - one class pictured - before they joined the @entity26 a teacher working for the organisation @entity146 said : ' some kids here have jobs			1
they work in shops or tea stalls			0
we talk to those kids and motivate them to study and join our classes			0
' this helps us bring them into the mainstream			0
' when kids start depositing their earnings in the bank			2
that is an education for life			0
they will inculcate the habit of making savings			0
this will become a habit and help them in the future			0
' the @entity7 initiative has won numerous accolades , leading to them expanding the scheme to other parts of @entity11			1
studies : a class takes place inside the shelter - which has won numerous awards for its work with children facilities : the children are given computer training ( pictured ) while at the shelter now butterflies plan to introduce the initiative in @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 as well as some parts of @entity191			1
