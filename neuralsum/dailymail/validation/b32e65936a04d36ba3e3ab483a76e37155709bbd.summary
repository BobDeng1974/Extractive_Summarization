a disabled woman who defied the odds to exchange vows with her partner and become @entity5 's first married couple with @entity7 's syndrome has died aged 45			1
@entity8 and her husband @entity9 defied the odds - and social workers - to marry one another in 2004			1
the childhood sweethearts met in a home for children with learning difficulties and after falling in love as teenagers they fought a long battle to be allowed to marry			1
disabled @entity20 , 45 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , has died aged 45			1
she and her husband made history in 2004 when they became @entity5 's first married couple with @entity7 's syndrome ( pictured ) when the @entity26 interviewed them in 2006 , @entity8 , then aged 37 , said : ' i love @entity9 this much			1
now he is my husband i am so proud			2
' i give him a kiss in the morning when he leaves for work , and i shout after him ' i love you , @entity33 ' and he says ' i love you , @entity8 ' , and i watch him as he walks all the way down the road			1
' i know that some people say we should not have got married , but why not ? we love each other very much and we look after each other			2
' @entity8 had a known heart condition related to her disability , and the couple relied on a daily carer to check that they are coping with domestic tasks - but other than that , they were much like any other married couple			1
the couple ( pictured ) met in a home for children with learning difficulties when @entity8 was just three @entity8 was just three years old when she was sent to live at the @entity53 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity9 , who had been raised in a foster home , arrived at @entity55 when he was 13 , when his elderly foster mother was unable to cope			1
they became fast friends and eventually fell in love , but in 1996 @entity8 was re-housed in a secure community house , while @entity9 remained at @entity55 , which had been turned into an adult centre			1
while social workers were pleased with the move - with her high - functioning @entity7 's syndrome , @entity8 was able to take a part - time job at a local hotel - no one realised she was missing @entity9			1
@entity8 said : ' i missed him			2
i heard music and i wanted to dance with him			0
if i felt sad inside my heart , there was no one to make me laugh any more			0
' i wanted to see my friend , so i asked my carer if i could invite him over for tea , and she said yes			0
i was so excited and i chose some special biscuits			0
' after arrangements by social workers caring for the pair @entity9 was driven to @entity8 's house for a three - hour visit			1
the couple battled against the odds to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry when the front door opened they fell into each other 's arms - much to the astonishment of onlookers			1
some local authorities have been known to make disabled couples perform a capacity assessment to determine whether they are sufficiently able to have sexual relations and get married without a high risk of abuse or exploitation			0
but section 1 of the @entity99 says a person must be assumed to have capacity until it is established that they do not			0
disabled people often have to fight the assumption that because they have a learning disability they lack the capacity to marry or to have sexual relations @entity109 's chief executive , @entity108 , said last year : ' for someone with a learning disability to have their right to marry so seriously interfered with is not only heartbreaking for the couple and their families , but a denial of their basic human rights			1
' professionals and wider society are too quick to make prejudiced and ill - informed judgments about what people with a learning disability can and ca n't do			2
' sexual health charity @entity125 ran a campaign a few years ago to highlight the rights of people with learning disabilities to have relationships			0
the fight for the right to marry is part of a wider battle for people with learning disabilities to have a family			0
@entity139 said : ' it suddenly became obvious just how much they had missed each other			0
' @entity8 was so thrilled to see @entity9 - she took him by the hand and led him to her little sitting room , and they were both so happy			1
' they had always been inseparable at the children 's home - and suddenly here they were , together again and loving every moment			2
without each other , they existed			0
together , they just shone			0
' the couple battled against the odds to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry			1
their wish stunned social workers who worried about the implications of such a marriage , the possible pregnancy and whether the couple could understand the meaning and legality of their vows			0
initially a compromise was reached and the couple received a blessing in 1995			0
but for @entity8 and @entity9 this was not enough			1
the committed @entity170 , who went to church every week , wanted a church ceremony with all the trimmings			0
they were over the age of consent and social workers and the @entity177 staff were finally forced to relent			0
@entity8 said at the time : ' @entity9 asked me to marry him and i told him yes			1
i cried - some big fat tears went down my face because i was so happy			0
' @entity9 got down on his knee and said : ' will you marry me ? ' and i said : ' yes			2
' i loved him so much i could actually feel it inside my heart			0
i had seen pictures of ladies getting married , in magazines , and i wanted to look like that , too			0
' i wanted to have a pretty white dress , and i wanted @entity9 to have a smart suit and i wanted to be with him always			2
that is what marriage means — to love somebody and to be with them always			0
' @entity8 said : ' i am just a normal wife and @entity9 is just my normal husband			1
that 's all we 've ever wanted to be ' @entity8 was given anti pregnancy injections because her weak heart might not have coped with childbirth and the couple saved up for gold rings , wedding dress and suit			1
their wedding was held on september 24 , 2004 with the blessing of the @entity209 and the authorities at the @entity211 at @entity21 , @entity22			0
@entity212 , then director of the @entity177 said : ' their were many barriers put ibn their way but their love for each other was so obvious but the birth control was needed to protect @entity8 's heart			1
' mp @entity221 , a @entity177 patron said : ' i was very sad to hear of the death of @entity8 she was a well known figure in the town			2
' they were the first couple with @entity227 to marry in this country and were inseparable in their time @entity229 is a difficult time for @entity9 and my thoughts are with him			1
' @entity8 told the @entity26 in 2006 : ' we love being @entity233 and mrs together			1
i make @entity9 a meal in the evening and we sit on the sofa next to each other			2
we love to watch @entity238 or @entity239			0
' we look at our wedding album every day and the pictures make us smile			0
if it is sunny , we go for walks and we hold hands			0
or @entity9 plays his music and we dance and tell each other jokes			2
' she added : ' i am just a normal wife and @entity9 is just my normal husband			1
that 's all we 've ever wanted to be			0
' @entity249 , ceo of the @entity251 , said : ' we were so sorry to hear the sad news of @entity8 's death			2
' this was such an inspirational story of true love triumphing over all and it paved the way for so many others to follow			0
all our thoughts are with @entity9 and the family at this very difficult time			2
