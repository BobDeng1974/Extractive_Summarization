by @entity0 , health correspondent @entity2 , chief executive of the charity diabetes @entity4 has criticised plans to offer free weight loss surgery plans to offer free weight - loss surgery to almost one million adults are nonsense , experts said last night			1
in guidelines issued this week , the @entity11 watchdog @entity12 said patients who are obese and have type 2 diabetes should be considered for gastric band or bypass operations			1
up to 900,000 patients meet the criteria and it would cost £ 4.5billion if all wanted bariatric surgery , which includes gastric bands to constrict the stomach and bypasses that reroute the digestive system			1
@entity12 claims the surgery helps patients with type 2 diabetes lose weight and control the disease			1
but experts said the @entity11 could not afford to pay for all the procedures and patients would do better to diet and get more exercise			1
there are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead			1
baroness @entity2 , chief executive of the charity @entity45 , said : ‘ the idea that we ’d all , or a significant proportion of us , go and have an operation as part of a programme seems to me to be a sign of failure			0
‘ give me the £ 5,000 you ’d spend on an operation and put it into a weight - reduction program and we could win			1
the more important thing is that people who head for obesity get effective interventions long before they fall into criteria that would justify surgery			2
’ @entity63 , a bariatric surgeon at @entity65 hospital , said : ‘ expecting the @entity4 to have the provision to operate on nearly a million people is an unrealistic proposition			0
the majority of people , their degree of obesity will be corrected by exercise alone			0
’ speaking on @entity75 ’s today programme , he added : ‘ the idea that the @entity11 could deal with 900,000 extra patients with this alone is nonsensical			2
’ about 2.6million @entity4 have type 2 diabetes , and up to a third of adults have prediabetes , a precursor to the illness			0
there are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead diabetes costs the @entity11 £ 14billion a year , much of which spent treating debilitating complications such as blindness , strokes , kidney failure and amputations			1
@entity12 says evidence shows bariatric surgery helps patients control their diabetes and in some cases effectively cures them			1
gastric bands cost at least £ 5,000 and gastric bypasses cost £ 9,500 or more			1
last year 8,024 operations were carried out			0
both reduce the size of the stomach , which causes patients to lose their appetite			2
at the moment , the @entity11 only offers them to morbidly obese patients with a body mass index ( @entity110 ) of 40 or more – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 20 stone			2
@entity110 is based on height and weight			0
the obese are those with a score higher than 30			0
the new guidelines propose offering surgery to anyone with type 2 diabetes and a @entity110 of at least 30 – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 15st 10lb			0
@entity124 , of the @entity125 , said : ‘ a considerable number of people who have had diabetes for some time and have been receiving medication will see a way out and they ’ll say , “ that ’s for me ”			0
but the @entity132 is going to say , “ no , we ’re out of money , you ca n’t have it ” , and that ’s going to create friction			0
’ professor @entity138 , of @entity12 , said : ‘ the mainstay of weight reduction continues to be diet and exercise			2
but some people , whose lives are threatened by diabetes , can be transformed if they are offered surgery earlier than current guidance would allow			0

experts say @entity11 can not afford to pay for all of the weight - loss procedures
would cost £ 4.5billion if all who are obese wanted bariatric surgery
concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight
patients instead *encouraged* to diet and get more exercise
