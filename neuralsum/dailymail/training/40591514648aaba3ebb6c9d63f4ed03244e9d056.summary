@entity0 in @entity1 charges its members almost 50 per cent more to join compared with its sister body in @entity4 – and almost six times the fee payable in some other countries			1
yet , in a glaring loophole , members from other heritage bodies from @entity9 to @entity10 are still allowed free entrance to historic @entity14 landmarks in @entity1 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
the @entity14 is losing hundreds of thousands of pounds under the reciprocal arrangement – as its own members pay a premium to enjoy unlimited admission to stately homes and castles compared to visiting tourists			0
but if each one became a full member of the @entity14 in @entity1 instead , it would boost the charity ’s income by £ 1.52million a year last night it emerged that the @entity14 has been fully aware of the loophole for years , and mps called for it to be closed			1
and @entity35 has discovered that some cunning residents of @entity1 and @entity15 are even taking advantage of the loophole themselves to download the membership forms for foreign organisations and sign up on the cheap			2
an estimated 80,000 people who live in @entity1 belong to the @entity4 trust			2
but if each one became a full member of the @entity14 in @entity1 instead , it would boost the charity ’s income by £ 1.52million a year			2
coming just weeks after the referendum for @entity4 independence , it is another example of how the @entity1 pay more than their @entity4 neighbours across the border			2
adult membership of the @entity14 costs £ 58 a year in @entity1 but people who join the equivalent heritage body over the border pay as little as £ 39 , meaning the @entity1 pay a 49 per cent premium for very similar benefits			1
@entity58 , chairman of the @entity59 , said he was surprised the loophole had not been closed already			0
‘ this is quite a serious amount of money we ’re talking about and if so many people from @entity1 and @entity15 are joining the @entity4 organisation , i ’m surprised the @entity0 has n’t done something about this			1
‘ they do a very good job in general and i would have thought they ’d want to keep this money in their coffers and put it to good use , but ultimately it ’s a matter for them			0
’ @entity58 , chairman of the @entity74 , said : i ’m surprised the @entity0 has n’t done something about this ' even meaner culture - lovers are joining heritage trusts in @entity10 , @entity78 , the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 where membership costs even less			1
‘ it ’s deeply disappointing			0
the more people who do this , the less money we have to look after these special places , ’ said an @entity14 spokesman			0
any @entity93 resident joining the national trust in @entity10 pays less than £ 14 a year ; in @entity81 the fee is £ 15.80 the @entity14 also offers free entrance to members of heritage trusts in @entity9 who pay £ 10 a year , @entity83 £ 20 , @entity100 £ 22 , @entity82 £ 25 , @entity80 £ 30 , @entity101 £ 32 , @entity102 £ 31 and @entity103 £ 36			1
the @entity14 admits there is a problem but believes that only ‘ a few thousand ’ deliberately exploit the loophole			0
it says heritage trusts in @entity9 , @entity83 , @entity82 and the @entity80 have strict membership rules and would not allow anyone living full - time in @entity93 to join their organisations to exploit the free entrance perk at @entity14 properties			1
the @entity0 added : ‘ we have been aware for some time that people in the @entity93 have joined overseas conservation organisations to access trust sites at a lower cost			0
‘ but we still get extra income from the money they spend in shops and cafes and they have to pay parking			0

adult membership of the @entity0 costs £ 58 a year in @entity1
but people who join the equivalent heritage body in @entity4 pay £ 39
in a glaring loophole , members from @entity9 to @entity10 are still allowed free entrance to @entity14 landmarks in @entity1 , @entity15 and @entity16
