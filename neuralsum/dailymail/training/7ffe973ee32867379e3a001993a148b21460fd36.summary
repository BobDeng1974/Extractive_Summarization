by @entity0 savings : @entity2 has outlined a range of measures to pay for his pledge @entity6 will today try to bring an end to weeks of wrangling over energy prices by promising handouts of £ 1,000 to new home - buyers			1
the surprise move will form part of a package of measures in @entity2 ’s @entity14 - seen as a ‘ mini-budget ’ - including plans to cut energy bills by £ 50 a year through the scrapping of green levies			1
the £ 1,000 grant , which is to pay for ‘ energy saving measures ’ , is a sop to @entity23 leader @entity23 , who resisted moves to axe the levies			1
mr @entity6 and deputy prime minister mr @entity23 will jointly declare that the average £ 50 cut will be achieved ‘ without taking any help away from poor families or sacrificing our green commitments ’			1
the savings are likely to be achieved partly by slashing the number of solid wall insulations energy companies are required to fit - the cost of which is passed on to consumers - from 100,000 to just 25,000 each year			1
this is expected to generate a saving of £ 40 per household			1
a further saving of about £ 10 will be achieved by the government agreeing to meet the cost of the @entity44 - which reduces bills for thousands of vulnerable customers - rather than forcing the energy companies to pay for it and pass on the cost			1
to accommodate objections that cutting the levies will undermine moves to make homes and businesses more energy - efficient , the two leaders will also make the declaration that anyone buying a home will receive up to £ 1,000 from the @entity42 - ‘ or even more for particularly expensive measures ’ - to pay for insulation if it is needed			1
mr @entity6 is determined to wrest the political initiative over energy prices back from mr @entity62 , who has pledged to impose a price freeze for two years if @entity64 wins the next general election			1
however , attempts by @entity66 to cut a deal with the companies - and then square the arrangement with the @entity23 - became increasingly fraught as details leaked into the media			1
no 10 was forced to deny vigorously a @entity73 report that ministers were demanding a price freeze from energy companies until the election			1
the measures will form the centrepiece of mr @entity2 ’s @entity14			1
however , he also faces pressure from @entity82 mps to introduce wider economic reforms			2
in an article for today ’s @entity86 ( below ) previewing a paper he has written for the @entity89 think - tank , rising @entity82 star @entity84 demands a raft of middle - class tax cuts worth nearly £ 3,000 a year to many higher - rate taxpayers – funded by a radical £ 17.6 billion of spending cuts			1
proposals : @entity84 mp , pictured , says the road to prosperity is to lower taxes and government spending @entity62 yearns to mimic @entity101 ’s winning pitch to voters in the 1980 us presidential election : ‘ are you better off than you were five years ago ? ’ yet most voters look to the future			2
if he ’s prepared to be bold , @entity6 can still convince people they will be better off under him			2
it ’s because - not despite - the challenges @entity110 still faces that people want a leader who can deliver a brighter future , not just fleeting respite from the recent economic mire			0
even at face value , @entity62 would struggle on @entity101 ’s test			0
many fundamentals - including unemployment and inflation - have improved since 2010			0
but the challenge remains steep			0
government has too much debt , the country too little to show for the recovery			0
the answer is n’t to match @entity62 ’s @entity128 economics - including price controls on energy firms			2
starting with the chancellor ’s @entity14 on thursday , the conservatives should chart a clear , honest and principled road map for prosperity			1
in a report for the @entity89 , i set out several key steps			0
first , less government spending and lower taxes			0
the conservatives should offer a triple - lock promise : to reduce the tax burden by 2020 , not to increase personal taxes , and apply a one - in , one - out rule to any other new taxes			0
to do so we must rein back further stubbornly high public spending			0
we can save £ 17.6billion by steps including halving the number of @entity42 departments and means - testing more benefits such as winter fuel and bus passes			2
we should cut employers ’ @entity157 and business rates to power job creation and level the high street ’s playing field with online retailers			2
we should lead , not follow , the debate about the lowest paid			0
@entity62 ’s jobs - killing proposal to legislate for a living wage would hurt the long - term and young unemployed most			0
a better idea is to raise the threshold for employee @entity157 , properly funded and targeted			0
finally , middle - class @entity169 should not be robbed to pay working - class @entity171			0
while the income tax collected from the basic rate has fallen ten per cent under the @entity176 , the amount collected from the higher rate is up by a third			0
anyone earning £ 20,000 a year has felt a rising tax burden			1
by tackling public spending , the @entity179 can ease the squeeze on the middle classes			0
we should cut the basic and higher rates of income tax by a penny each			2
long term , we should merge @entity157 and income tax – and move to two rates at 15 and 35 per cent , to boost @entity110 competitiveness and reward hard work and ambition			2
@entity6 has the conviction and charisma , but must also display some @entity101 will , to illuminate the path towards brighter days ahead .			0

surprise move will be part of the chancellor *'s* @entity14
it is an attempt to end weeks of wrangling over energy prices
the ' mini-budget ' will also see plans to cut energy bills by £ 50 a year by scrapping green levies
