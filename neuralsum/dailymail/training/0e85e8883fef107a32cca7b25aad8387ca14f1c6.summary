@entity0 have ' lost the way a little bit ' by offloading homegrown @entity3 to @entity5 rivals @entity6 and spending extravagantly to bring in players like @entity8 and @entity9 , according to former assistant manager @entity10			1
@entity11 striker @entity3 , a product of @entity0 's @entity13 who scored 29 goals in 142 first - team appearances , was sold to @entity6 on transfer deadline day on monday			1
while @entity3 headed to @entity18 , @entity0 were busy splashing the cash by sealing deals for @entity22 utility player @entity21 and @entity23 striker @entity9 , who has joined on a season - long loan			0
@entity29 's summer spending spree surpassed £ 150million , with a @entity39 transfer record of £ 59.7m pounds paid to lure @entity40 from @entity41			1
@entity0 also signed @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
@entity10 suggested it showed a lack of faith in @entity0 's youth system , renowned in the past for its production line of world - class talent like @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
star signing : @entity8 joined @entity0 from @entity41 for £ 59.7m ' interesting how things have changed at @entity0 now			1
a good young kid ( @entity3 ) coming through - part of the academy system - and they 've finally decided now that might not be the way to go so they 've moved him on , ' @entity10 , @entity58 's right - hand man at @entity32 between 2008 and 2013 , told @entity67			1
' obviously there is more and more money now in the game , looking further and further afield for players but probably they have lost the way of @entity0 a little bit in the fact that now rather than produce it may be the case where they 're buying in			2
@entity77 star : @entity42 joined @entity0 from @entity78 in the summer ' one of the issues of the @entity5 at the moment , and with @entity83 football at the moment , is getting them on to the football field , promoting them that way and waiting for those opportunities , providing the time and that has n't happened			2
' @entity10 said @entity0 's big spending now reflected a philosophy of wanting instant success under @entity29 after the former champions stagnated under @entity58 's successor @entity94			1
concerns : @entity10 says @entity0 have lost their way a little bit ' it 's success now , and not later			0
he 's had a good run at it , he 's come through the system ... there 's other kids there now in the system who will hopefully get a chance but there 's been a lot of cash splashed out in the transfer window and i 'm sure that will only get worse			2
' former @entity0 youth team coach @entity116 has also shared his concern over the @entity119 ' big spending this summer			0
he told the @entity120 : ' i am very concerned to be honest			0
' i can not believe @entity3 has gone			0
okay he might not have been a prolific goalscorer but his work rate and effort was undeniable			0
' there was a place for him and i am not too pleased he ’s gone to @entity6			0
it is sending out the wrong message when local home grown players like that are leaving			0

@entity0 spent over £ 150m on new signings this summer transfer window
in *addition* to a £ 59.7m deal for @entity8 , @entity0 also spent big money on the likes of @entity43 and @entity42
@entity10 has *criticised* the club , suggesting @entity0 's transfer business shows a lack of faith in their academy system and homegrown players
@entity29 is yet to win a *competitive* game for @entity0
