@entity1 and the @entity2 have dropped down a league table which rates the freedom of the press across the world , it emerged today			1
the @entity1 ’s slide from 19th to 28th place is partly blamed on fallout from the phone hacking scandal at the @entity10 which prompted the @entity11 into press ethics			1
researchers from watchdog @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , who compiled the @entity16 , also highlighted liberal libel laws which allow claimants of any nationality to sue in its courts			2
libel ' tourism ' is seen as a way for the richest to clamp down on freedom of expression			2
there were also concerns that the police had attempted to extract information from a number of private companies – including @entity31 – to identify looters during the @entity34 riots			2
league table : this map of the world shows countries with the most press freedom coloured white and the least coloured black @entity2 ’s performance was even worse			1
it dropped from 20th to 47th position on the back of heavy - handed police tactics at a string of demonstrations against corporate greed			1
a number of journalists – as well as protesters – were arrested as the @entity52 swept across the country			0
@entity54 , from @entity14 , described the statistics as a worrying trend			0
‘ the @entity57 prides itself on supporting the principles of free speech and freedom of expression , ’ she said			0
‘ if we are going to promote these principles across the rest of the world , then we ’ve got to make sure that we uphold them ourselves			0
’ in the @entity1 's case , there are fears that the @entity11 could have further - reaching consequences than anyone initially envisaged			1
long - overdue reform of archaic libel laws would make it more difficult for foreign nationals to sue through @entity1 courts however , there is some suggestion that @entity79 could delay enacting them into law because of @entity82			1
there is also the possibility that the press could face formal regulation for the first time			0
the press freedom index reflected a year of upheaval , protest and revolution worldwide - though participation in the @entity93 was no guarantee of an improved rating			1
while @entity97 ( up to 134 from 164 ) and @entity98 ( 160 to 154 ) fared well , @entity96 dropped from 127 to 166 after a wave of detentions by the army in the wake of the overthrow of @entity104			1
@entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 – where dictators clung to power by brutally suppressing protesters - racked up their worst - ever ratings			1
of the 179 countries on the index , @entity105 came in at 176 ( 173 in 2010 ) while @entity106 ranked at 173 , a drop of 29 places			1
bottom of the table were @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
@entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123 claimed the top spots			0
the biggest fall was by @entity126 , which dropped 67 places to 146 after the suppression of protests last summer			2
@entity130 , meanwhile , leapt spectacularly to 29th place – just one spot below the @entity1			1
‘ this year ’s index sees many changes in the rankings , changes that reflect a year that was incredibly rich in developments , especially in the @entity138 world , ’ @entity14 noted			0
‘ many media paid dearly for their coverage of democratic aspirations or opposition movements			0
‘ control of news and information continued to tempt governments and to be a question of survival for totalitarian and repressive regimes			0
‘ @entity150 was the word of the year in 2011			0
never has freedom of information been so closely associated with democracy ‘ it is no surprise that the same trio of countries , @entity120 , @entity118 and @entity119 , absolute dictatorships that permit no civil liberties , again occupy the last three places in the index			2
‘ this year , they are immediately preceded at the bottom by @entity105 , @entity173 and @entity174 , three countries that seem to have lost contact with reality as they have been sucked into an insane spiral of terror , and by @entity106 and @entity170 , quintessential oppressive regimes			1
’ the index is compiled by a team of @entity14 researchers who use a series of questions to rank each country			0
these address areas such as violence and abusive treatment of journalists , state - interference such as surveillance of members of the media and censorship			2
@entity14 revised this year 's questions to attempt to avoid a @entity191 bias .			0

@entity1 slides from 19th to 28th place on back of phone hacking , @entity11 and ' libel tourists '
@entity2 falls from 20th to 47th after heavy - handed *approach* to occupy demonstrators
mixed *fortunes* for @entity93 countries with @entity97 and @entity98 rising up the ranks
but @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 fall as dictators use suppression to cling to power
