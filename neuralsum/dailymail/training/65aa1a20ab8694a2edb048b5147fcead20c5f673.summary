by @entity0 savers locked into rip - off pensions and investments could be moved to better deals or allowed a free - exit , the @entity2 watchdog is due to say next week			1
an inquiry will be launched this summer into 30 million policies sold by insurance companies between the 70s and the millennium			1
the review , by the @entity13 , will include pensions , endowments , investment bonds and life insurance sold by doorstep salesmen			1
an inquiry is to be launched this summer by the @entity13 following concerns insurers are ¿ exploiting ¿ loyal policyholders who are ¿ not given the same priority as new customers ¿ the regulator is concerned that insurers are ‘ exploiting ’ loyal policyholders who are ‘ not given the same priority as new customers ’			1
@entity28 , the director of supervision at the @entity13 , told @entity30 : ‘ we want to find out how closed - book products are being serviced by insurance companies , as we are concerned insurers are allocating an unfair amount of overheads to historic funds			1
‘ as firms cut prices and create new products , there is a danger that customers with older contracts are forgotten			0
we want to ensure they get a fair deal			0
as part of the review we will collect information to establish whether we need to intervene on exit charges			0
’ savers locked into rip - off pensions and investments could be moved to better deals or allowed a free - exit ( file picture ) many customers signed up to financial products at the prompting of doorstep salesman working on commission only to face steep exit penalties - sometimes more than 50 per cent of the total pension pot - if they later want to leave or switch to a better deal			1
the regulator is considering whether these obstructive ‘ lock - in ’ fees on policies – which can last until the customer reaches the policy ’s retirement age - should be banned			1
the inquiry will be revealed in the annual @entity13 business plan for the next financial year , which will be published on monday			2
banning unfair exit fees on old pension policies would be one the strongest actions the @entity13 could take , mr @entity28 said			2
alternatives include asking firms to move customers to a better product , providing clearer information , investing more in the management of old funds , offering a greater variety of investment options within the policy or cutting fees			0
the @entity13 estimates that the policies under review are worth £ 150 billion			2
many of the companies behind the products have since been subsumed into rival organisations through takeovers			0
mr @entity28 added : ‘ consolidation and outsourcing within the insurance industry means that policies taken out 10 , 15 or 20 years ago are unlikely to be managed by the same brand , and by people in the same building as they were at their outset			0
‘ we want to make sure that customers who have been ‘ sold on ’ are treated fairly			0
some terms and conditions that were common 20 years ago are not what we would want to see now			0
