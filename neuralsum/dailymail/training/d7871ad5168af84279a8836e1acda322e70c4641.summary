by @entity0 despite losing 2 - 1 against @entity2 , @entity1 could take many positives from opening @entity5 match defeat in @entity6 one of them was the form of @entity9 , with the @entity11 striker scoring on his @entity5 debut after grabbing an equaliser for @entity15 's side in @entity16			1
it was a familiar sight for @entity19 fans , who have seen the striker score consistently since arriving from @entity21 last year , as was the 24 - year - old 's trademark dance celebration after his strike			0
starting early : @entity9 has been dancing after scoring since he was a teenager in the flow : @entity9 celebrates scoring for @entity27 under 15s against @entity29 needs work : @entity9 's celebration as a teenager lacks the finesse compared to today reappearance ? @entity1 fans will hope @entity9 sticks to his original celebration if he scores against @entity37 and as well as his overall play , it seems the former @entity27 hitman 's dance floor moves have also made dramatic improvements over the last 10 years			2
footage of @entity44 scoring against a @entity29 youth side in 2004 for @entity27 's under 15 team show a more wild take to the post-match dance celebration - perhaps lacking the finesse with his arms he would develop over the next decade			0
@entity1 fans will hope @entity9 can continue his @entity5 form to help shoot down @entity37 in a pivotal clash concerning the @entity1 ' last 16 hopes			2
but to prevent global embarrassment , we would rather @entity9 stick to his modern dance celebration rather than the teenager at a school disco			0
the modern way : @entity9 celebrates scoring against @entity2 in @entity1 's opening @entity5 game not enough : @entity9 's strike brought @entity1 level against @entity2 , but the @entity1 would lose 2 - 1			1

@entity1 face @entity37 in pivotal @entity67 meeting
@entity9 set to lead *attack* after scoring against @entity2
three @entity1 defeated 2 - 1 by @entity2 in opening group match
last 16 hopes hang in the balance for both teams going into @entity77 clash
