by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 he turns 21 next thursday , but there ’s another number that has been dominating @entity6 ’s every waking moment			1
with the season nearing a nail - biting finale , all the @entity7 left back can think of is reaching the magical 40 - point mark and ensuring his home club remain in the @entity13			1
a couple of wins and a draw would do it and while the shortfall remains , nothing else matters			1
not celebrating his landmark birthday , not wondering which club might eventually win the bidding for his services			1
there are plenty of contenders			1
@entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have all followed the @entity34 defender ’s rapid progress closely , and @entity35 are now showing strong interest			1
all smiles : @entity7 left back @entity6 has had a fine season and attracted interest from @entity35 top form : @entity35 currently top @entity41 and will face @entity42 in the @entity44 semi-finals @entity6 was as sceptical as anyone at first mention of the @entity41 leaders , but confirmation has since come from @entity35 as well as here that @entity42 ’s @entity44 semi-final opponents are taken with the composed way he has seized his chance at the @entity52			1
it brings a brief smile to his face , but the serious business of staying up soon takes precedence for a sporting all - rounder who had his rugby - mad dad dreaming he might be another @entity62 but was snapped up by @entity7 at eight years old			1
‘ the first i knew about @entity35 was when a pal texted me the morning the story appeared , ’ he said			1
‘ my phone beeped and there was this message saying , “ have you seen this ? @entity35 ? ! ” i went online to see what it was all about			1
it is nice to hear something like that because it clearly means you must be doing something right			1
‘ it ’s got to be a boost for your confidence but it ’s not going to turn my head			1
i do n’t need something like that to make me concentrate on what ’s in front of me or suddenly up my game			2
i ’m going to do that anyway , for myself and my club			2
i am ambitious about playing at the highest level i can but i tend to think that if you put performances in to the best of your ability , things will take care of themselves			2
‘ for now , all i ’m thinking about is staying up			2
my mum wants to organise a party for my 21st but that can wait			2
once we ’re safe , maybe , but not before			2
i ’ve told her to hang on for that , then we can have a proper party			2
’ focused : despite the interest from @entity102 , @entity6 is committed to keeping the @entity103 in the @entity13 on hold : @entity105 wants to organise a party for his 21st birthday but the left back says it can wait the range of nationalities in @entity7 ’s dressing room has been in the news this week , with @entity113 breaking the story that there had been training - ground punch - ups between the players			1
but @entity6 revealed how manager @entity118 has gone about imbuing the foreign contingent with a sense of local identity			1
‘ one of the first things @entity124 did after replacing @entity125 was to bring a pile of @entity127 in and hand them out , ’ he said			2
‘ it was the @entity129 documentary @entity130 of @entity7 , and he told each and every one of us to watch it that night			1
‘ we chatted about it the next day and you could tell there was n’t one person who had n’t watched it right through			2
the manager wanted us all to appreciate how much @entity7 meant to people who have been through the rough times and seen the club almost go to the wall			1
the boss : @entity6 revealed manager @entity118 has gone about imbuing the foreign contingent at @entity7 proud of his roots : local lad @entity6 says he ill be devastating if @entity7 are relegated at the end of the season ‘ you would n’t know it now , looking at the fantastic facilities , but even in my time coming through the ranks , the @entity149 had to train on the beach			1
‘ anyway , it had an immediate effect because we put in a fantastic performance to beat @entity160 in the next game			2
we are still in a scrap , no mistake , but i do think we ’ve shown more resilience and spirit since then			2
‘ we ’ve just got to stay up			0
i ’ll be absolutely devastated if we do n’t			0
i ’m from down the road at @entity168 and so proud of my @entity170 roots			0
all my family , right through to grandparents on both sides , speak @entity170 , and so do i. it was how i was brought up and it just seemed natural to speak @entity176 and @entity170 fluently			0
even at school , junior and secondary , all lessons were in @entity170			0
‘ if the club need to do an interview for the @entity170 - speaking media , it ’s always me			1
but i ’m happy with that because the language seems to be dwindling and i ’ll do anything i can to keep it to the fore			0
’ patriotic : @entity6 is happy to do @entity170 - speaking interviews and will do anything to stop the language dwindling @entity6 was thrown in at the deep end after a serious injury to @entity194 but has thrived to such an extent that he has already played well over 60 games since his debut against @entity198 in august 2012			1
yet it could have been the oval ball that shot him to prominence			0
‘ my dad is rugby through and through and took me to watch @entity168 when i was little , ’ he said			0
‘ i played outside half at school and we reached the @entity206 final two years running			0
three professionals came out of that team and went on to play for @entity209 , so we were n’t bad			0
‘ my dad grew up watching @entity62 and @entity210 , so i think he liked the idea of me wearing the no 10 jersey			0
i had a decent rugby brain but i ’m not sure i would have made a professional			0
@entity215 mad : @entity6 ' @entity216 used to take @entity6 to see @entity168 and grew up watching @entity62 ( right ) ‘ to be fair to @entity216 , he wanted me to do what i was best at and what i wanted to do , and that was football			1
both my parents have been 100 per cent the biggest influence on my development			0
they taught me good values and are still there for me with advice and help			0
‘ that was so important when i was trying to make my way as a junior with @entity7			1
i saw so many lads come and go at the academy who were good players but got caught up in distractions like going out for a drink			0
i was always dedicated and focused because football was all i ever wanted to do			0
‘ we trained twice a week and played on a sunday			0
for me , it was never a problem staying in on saturday night and getting to bed early			0
i wanted to be at my best the next morning			0
‘ i hope that does n’t make me sound too boring because i ’m not really			0
i ’m off to @entity244 with a couple of mates in the summer , a real lads ’ holiday			0
i like a beer as much as the next guy			0
it ’s just a question of choosing the right moment , and this summer will be , if we stay up			0
’ commitment : @entity6 says he used to stay in on a saturday night in order to be at his best for sunday 's matches			1
