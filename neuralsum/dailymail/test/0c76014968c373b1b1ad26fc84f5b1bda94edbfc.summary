@entity0 left @entity1 down , almost out , and in danger of needing snookers to avoid relegation from the @entity5			1
one source of salvation could yet come in the form of a three - point deduction for @entity10 when a @entity12 disciplinary commission rules on whether they fielded an ineligible player against @entity14 on @entity15			0
but even that might not be enough			0
the result leaves @entity19 ’s side four points adrift of fourth - bottom @entity10 with two tough games remaining against promotion - chasing @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity10 have a game in hand and a much better goal difference			0
@entity27 ( centre ) scores the opening goal for @entity30 as he fires past the helpless @entity31 goals certainly make a difference and , in @entity27 and @entity34 , @entity30 have two players that @entity0 simply do not			1
@entity27 , scorer of a hat - trick against @entity37 here on saturday , took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute , despatching a clinical right - foot shot into the top corner after @entity44 ’s cross found its way to him on the edge of the six - yard box			1
@entity34 is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory , steering his shot past a stranded @entity31 in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser			1
the big striker bagged goal number 20 for the season as he continues his excellent form for rovers @entity30 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity59 7 ; @entity60 5.5 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 37 , 6.5 ) , @entity64 6 ; @entity44 8 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 6 ( @entity68 71 , 7 ) ; @entity69 6 ( @entity34 71 , 7 ) , @entity27 6.5			1
subs : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74			0
scorers : @entity27 78 , @entity34 90 +3 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity31 6 ; @entity76 6.5 , @entity77 5.5 , @entity78 6 , @entity79 5 ( @entity80 83 ) ; @entity81 5.5 , @entity82 5 ; @entity83 5 ( @entity84 61 , 5.5 ) , @entity85 6.5 , @entity86 6 ; @entity87 6.5 ( @entity88 61 , 6 )			1
subs : @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93			0
booked : @entity84 referee : @entity95 @entity96 man : @entity44 in contrast , @entity0 ’s two leading scorers — @entity87 and @entity88 — have just six apiece			1
the failings in front of goal were all too apparent on tuesday night			0
‘ their two goalscorers have scored more than my whole squad , ’ lamented @entity19			2
‘ it ’s clear to see why they won 2 - 0			0
‘ the team were excellent but we did n’t take our chances			0
before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division			0
we need six or seven points so my thoughts still have n’t changed			0
’ @entity0 ’s best chance fell to substitute @entity115 in the 68th minute			2
he was clean through on goal after @entity30 were caught out by @entity119 ’s long ball forward , but goalkeeper @entity59 rushed off his line to block			2
rovers , who lost captain @entity62 to injury in the first half and had to play debutant @entity63 in central defence , had their fair share of chances , but it needed @entity128 to make the difference			0
@entity27 and @entity34 provided it for @entity30			1
@entity34 slots home the second in injury time to make @entity0 's survival aspirations look impossible @entity34 celebrated being named in the @entity12 team of the decade with the second goal @entity19 ' side look almost condemned to relegation from the @entity5 with two games to still to play manager @entity140 is realistic enough to know that they might not both be at @entity1 next season			1
‘ i understand the business we ’re in , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity146 sold @entity147 and no doubt there will be people leaving bigger clubs than @entity30 in the summer			2
but you ’ve seen with @entity34 and @entity27 this season , if the owners ’ valuation is not met , then we wo n’t sell them			1
’ @entity83 ( left ) and @entity65 compete for the ball during @entity30 's win at @entity1			2

@entity19 ' side look likely to be relegated from the @entity5
goals from @entity27 and @entity34 sealed the *tie*
@entity0 are now four points from *safety* with two games to play
@entity30 are currently ninth after a strong finish to the season
