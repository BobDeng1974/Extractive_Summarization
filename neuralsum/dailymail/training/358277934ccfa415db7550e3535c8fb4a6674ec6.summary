assassination claim : @entity2 leader @entity1 died of thromboccytopenia at first they thought it must have been something he ’d eaten			1
about two hours after having supper , at 11.30pm on the evening of october 11 , 2004 , @entity1 felt sick			1
the 75 - year - old chairman of the @entity7 vomited twice , then felt a little better			1
but when he awoke the next morning , he felt worse			0
a doctor diagnosed viral gastroenteritis , and the @entity2 leader was given medicine			1
by that evening he seemed to be responding well , and a report later stated he ‘ continued with his usual activities ’ at his compound in @entity16 on the @entity17			0
over the next few days @entity1 ’s condition stabilised , but did not improve			1
medical staff were baffled , and it was only when @entity22 doctors were summoned , nearly two weeks after he fell ill , that the real cause of @entity1 ’s illness was diagnosed : thrombocytopenia — a reduced number of platelets in the blood			1
platelets are a key part of the clotting system , and a low count can lead to spontaneous internal bleeding			0
bone marrow samples were taken and , as he deteriorated further , @entity1 was flown to the @entity35 in @entity36			0
on november 3 , he fell into a coma , and in the early hours of november 11 he died of internal bleeding in the brain			2
for nearly a decade , the true cause of death of a man regarded by some as the world ’s most evil terrorist has remained a mystery , amid accusations from his family and supporters that he was poisoned			2
this week , however , the world came a step closer to finding out the truth			0
two years ago , @entity1 ’s widow and daughter demanded a @entity55 judicial inquiry into his death			2
since then @entity58 scientists have investigated his belongings for traces of poison			2
polonium - 210 , a toxic radioactive material , was found on the @entity7 leader 's toothbrush , claim scientists			1
file picture and they have announced the results in the medical journal @entity70 : they found traces of a highly toxic radioactive material , polonium - 210 , on his headwear , underpants and toothbrush			1
in the article , coyly titled ‘ improving forensic investigation for polonium poisoning ’ , the team say they took samples of blood , sweat and urine from @entity1 ’s clothes and found they contained significantly higher than expected levels of polonium - 210			1
‘ these findings support the possibility of @entity1 ’s poisoning with polonium - 210 , ’ the report baldly states			2
it is a conclusion that tallies with another investigation of @entity1 ’s belongings , which was published in may last year			1
the authors of both reports stress that their findings are not definitive , but they certainly point to an assassination			0
@entity2 children sit next to candles and a mock coffin for the late @entity2 leader @entity1 during a ceremony marking the third anniversary of his death for a start , @entity1 ’s symptoms were almost identical to those of a 43 - year - old @entity108 admitted to @entity109 , @entity110 , in november 2006 , suffering from a mysterious illness			1
he died on november 22 that year			1
that man was a former @entity108 intelligence agent called @entity113			2
a post-mortem examination revealed he had been poisoned by polonium - 210			2
did the @entity2 leader suffer the same fate ? and if so , who were the killers ? to most people the answer seems obvious — @entity121 , or to be specific , the @entity121 @entity120 , better known as @entity120			1
certainly the organisation does not shy away from ‘ dirty tricks ’ including kidnapping and assassination			2
killing @entity1 would have been well within its remit			0
in 2010 two car bomb blasts killed one @entity130 nuclear scientist and wounded another in @entity132			0
many believe @entity120 was behind the blast after all , @entity1 conducted a terror campaign against @entity121 and the @entity17 for decades , and groups under his direct or indirect command were responsible for hundreds of bombing , hijackings , assassinations and other attacks			1
since it was founded in december 1949 , @entity120 has earned an almost mythic notoriety			0
one of its earliest successes was the abduction of @entity146 — the architect of the @entity148 — from a street in @entity150 in 1960			0
according to one account , the ultra-secret agency within the organisation that carries out assassinations is appropriately called the @entity156 ¿ bayonet while @entity146 was taken to @entity121 to face a trial and execution , other @entity158 war criminals were dispatched with less due process			1
in 1965 , a 64 - year - old @entity162 called @entity163 was lured into a small house in @entity165 , @entity166 , by a portly , balding man calling himself @entity168			1
as @entity163 stepped into the hall he was leapt upon by a @entity120 team and killed with two bullets to the brain			0
his body was packed into a trunk with a note that identified his killers as ‘ @entity177 ’			0
the hit had been carried out in revenge for the murder of @entity181 by @entity182 in @entity183 during the war			0
@entity120 has a long memory and its revenge is brutally efficient , as witnessed in @entity187 , its response to the 1972 massacre of 11 members of the @entity121 @entity191 team by @entity2 terrorists			1
the operation lasted for two decades and involved a worldwide series of shootings and bombings			0
all the assassinations were meticulously planned			0
while some were straightforward shootings , others , such as the killing of @entity203 , the @entity7 ’s man in @entity55 , were more complicated			0
towards the end of 1972 , a @entity120 team placed a bomb under a phone on @entity203 ’s desk			0
an agent pretending to be a journalist rang up			0
when @entity203 answered , the @entity121 detonated the bomb with an electronic signal down the phone line			1
according to one account , the ultra-secret agency within the organisation that carries out assassinations is appropriately called the @entity156 — bayonet			0
in 1997 , the @entity156 was supposedly behind the botched attempt to assassinate @entity219 , the leader of @entity220			0
opponents : an @entity121 soldier fires a tear gas canister at @entity2 throwing stones during a military operation in the @entity17 the plan involved spraying a poison developed at @entity121 ’s top secret @entity229 biological institute into the ear of the terrorist leader while he was in @entity233			1
the attempt , on september 25 , 1997 , was a fiasco			0
though agents managed to spray the poison into their target ’s ear , two of them were arrested almost immediately			0
the @entity233 were furious and insisted that @entity121 supply an antidote to save @entity219 ’s life			1
such failures are rare for the @entity156 , though			0
its most recent spectacular assassination was the killing of @entity247 , a senior @entity220 commander found dead in @entity249 in january 2010			2
it quickly became apparent that his death was not natural , and that it was a @entity120 hit			2
to the fascination of the world , authorities in @entity249 released images of the faked passports of the killers , who were posing as tourists from countries including @entity262 and the @entity263 today , one of the riskiest jobs in the world is being an @entity130 nuclear scientist			2
on january 11 , 2011 , @entity268 , deputy head of the @entity270 uranium enrichment plant , was blown up in his car by a magnetic bomb as he drove to work			0
his death followed those of three other scientists in 2010			2
at the beginning of this month , when @entity275 , of the @entity277 ’ cyber warfare unit , was gunned down by black - clad gunmen on motorcycles near his home in @entity281 , northwest of @entity132 , @entity120 was top of the list of suspects			2
but the question remains : was @entity120 responsible for @entity1 ’s death ? clearly , the @entity121 had the ability to kill him and , as he was a sponsor of terrorism against them , they had tried before			1
in 1985 the @entity121 air force attacked a @entity7 base in @entity295 , admitting it had targeted the building where @entity1 had offices			1
@entity1 survived because he was out jogging			0
in 2003 , the year before the @entity7 leader died , his security adviser @entity298 claimed that his boss had survived no fewer than 13 assassination attempts , including a package of anthrax that was sent to him in may that year			1
attempts on @entity1 ’s life had started in the @entity306			0
in december 1967 he narrowly escaped being killed at his villa in @entity16			0
hearing @entity121 voices , he leapt from the second floor and hid in a parked car			1
on another occasion , in @entity312 , @entity121 snipers were said to have had @entity1 in their sights , only for the hit to be aborted on the orders of general @entity317			1
so @entity121 has form on @entity1 and , as a nuclear power , it was able to acquire polonium - 210			1
could one of its agents have applied a lethal dose to @entity1 ’s toothbrush , so it was absorbed through the gums ? it sounds far - fetched ... but so does spraying poison in an enemy ’s ear			1
the case is still far from clear - cut			2
after all , @entity1 was considered a spent force by 2004 — so what had @entity121 to gain by assassinating him ? some suspect that the trace levels of polonium - 210 were so high they might have been planted by @entity2 to frame the @entity121			1
we must wait a little longer and see what tissue samples from @entity1 ’s disinterred body tell us			0
but even if turns out that @entity120 did not kill him , we can be sure the @entity156 will continue taking scalps for many more years to come .			0

the 75 - year - old died of a blood condition in 2004 aged 75
radioactive substance found on his belongings - including his toothbrush
@entity121 intelligence may have been behind the @entity2 's death
