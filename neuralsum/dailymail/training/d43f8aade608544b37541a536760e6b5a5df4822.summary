by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 17:36 est , 12 may 2013 @entity1 : i 'm wildly in love with my new partner , but he 's so boring in bed - he 'll only try one position and turn the light off			1
i 've suggested we experiment , but he says men of his age ( he is in his late - 50s ) are creatures of habit			2
i want to reply that my ex-husband and i ( also 50 - somethings ) were always adventurous , but am scared he might leave me			0
what should i do ? @entity0 says : ' many women can accept a less exotic sex life in their 50s , in exchange for finding a companion they truly love and trust ' answer : golden rule number one : it is never a good idea to talk to your current love about the fabulous sex you had with an ex. this is particularly true if the five - star bedroom artiste is your former spouse			1
many people end up loving a person who does n't top their personal ' best in bed ' poll , but how can it benefit anyone involved to share that knowledge ? what you need to challenge is the ' creatures of habit ' statement			1
what your partner means is that he is a creature of habit and frightened of change			0
can you track down an area of his life in which he has had to modernise ? does he tweet , or use @entity52 , or watch 3d films ? all these mediums have only been in widespread use for a decade			0
most of us acknowledge our lives can be enhanced by embracing change			0
if he 's not a new media convert , can you find a place he 's visited , or activity he 's embraced ( dancing , golf , gardening , crosswords ? ) , that was not previously on his menu ? the trick is to persuade your partner that he is not nearly such a stick - in - the - mud as he thinks he is			1
if you win the verbal argument outside the bedroom , it 's more than likely you can win some manoeuvrability inside it			1
why not make a pact that you can take charge for one night - and if he does n't like it , he 's back in the driving seat			2
make it clear that if a new caress or position increases his pleasure , you 'll continue down that path ; but if it does n't , then you will desist			0
do bear in mind that the whole notion of change almost certainly scares your man , so you have to make adjustments that are gradual , simple and soothing			0
do n't suggest anything too unusual : your aim is to demystify the concept of sexual adventure			0
of course , your partner may be one of those stubborn old - school types , who refuses to budge from his comfort zone			0
if this is the case , you will have to make some tough decisions			0
how key is exciting sex to your existence ? many women can accept a less exotic sex life in their 50s , in exchange for finding a companion they truly love and trust			1
and remember that many women would give their right arm to find a man who desires them and wants to have sex , no matter how repetitive the act			1
the main thing is that you are in love with him			2
i presume he 's kind , attractive and interesting			2
are n't these better qualities than the ability to perform the @entity124 's entire repertoire ? if your answer to this question is no , then your partner clearly is n't right for you			2
but before you do anything rash , reflect on the words of one 52 - year - old divorcee : ' i can find hundreds of men who want to have wild sex on dating sites , but finding a soulmate who will kiss me tenderly when i 'm 80 is like hunting for a unicorn			1

is it ever a good idea to talk about sex you had with an ex ?
many people end up loving someone who is not their best ever sex
it 's rarer to find someone you truly love and who loves you , says @entity0
