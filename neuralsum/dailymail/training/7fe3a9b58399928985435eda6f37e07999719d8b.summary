by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 18 february 2013 opposed : @entity1 has said that controversial amendments to the @entity3 would damage free speech and break human rights laws if allowed to stand @entity7 - inspired proposals on media law would curb the @entity9 in a way ‘ never seen in any democratic country ’ , a senior peer warned last night			1
@entity13 said controversial amendments to the @entity3 pushed through with @entity7 support this month would damage free speech and break @entity17 human rights laws if they were allowed to stand			1
he accused @entity7 of ‘ hijacking ’ the legislation in an attempt to force the government to implement @entity23 ’s plans for regulation of the @entity9 in the wake of the phone hacking scandal			1
ministers are said to be so concerned by the proposals that the entire piece of legislation could be abandoned			1
but @entity1 , the architect of the @entity3 , said this would be a travesty , as vital reforms of @entity35 ’s notorious libel laws would also be lost			1
his intervention comes amid growing @entity21 anxiety about an amendment pushed through the @entity39 by 272 votes to 141 earlier this month			0
the amendment , put forward by @entity7 - supporting film director @entity42 , would introduce an arbitration service for members of the public wronged by the @entity9			1
the legislation would mean that newspapers that did not join the system could be punished by courts awarding potentially ruinous damages and costs			2
crossbench peer @entity52 , who is backing the move , yesterday suggested the arbitration system could help prevent the publication of ‘ things which may be true , but whose publication has no sufficient reason ’			0
he suggested newspapers should face exemplary damages if they failed to get approval from the new regulator before publication			0
but @entity1 said this form of ‘ prior restraint ’ – which was demanded by former @entity69 boss @entity68 – was only used in a handful of former @entity72 states			0
changes : the amendment to the @entity3 put forward by @entity42 , left , followed @entity23 's report into press ethics @entity1 said the impact of the @entity79 amendments would be to introduce ‘ a form of coercion i have not seen in any democratic country ’			1
warning : @entity83 has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with press freedom he told the @entity92 : ‘ the scheme they are recommending would be totally incompatible with human rights and free speech			2
instead of having self - regulation , which i believe strongly in , you would have a coerced system of arbitration			0
’ @entity1 , a @entity100 peer , said the amendment was ‘ inappropriate ’ as it tacked controversial privacy issues on to legislation on libel reform which has cross-party support , including the stated support of @entity7			1
he added : ‘ they have taken the @entity109 hostage in order to put pressure on the party leaders and the press over the implementation of the @entity23 reforms			0
' but @entity23 was n’t interested in libel law , he was interested in privacy			0
‘ i very much hope that when the @entity109 comes back to the @entity119 we can get agreement across the parties to release the @entity109 from the limbo it is now in so that we can get these reforms onto the statute book			0
’ the @entity3 , which has all - party support , would bring in long - overdue reforms to @entity35 ’s antiquated libel laws			2
the political parties are still locked in stalemate over how to implement @entity23 ’s reforms			0
@entity7 is demanding new laws to back up a new independent press regulator			1
but @entity83 has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with press freedom			2
he wants a new regulator to be established by @entity140 .			0
