the militants responsible for the bombings were also active on social networks , and used @entity13 to issue additional threats - including some against @entity15 , the @entity6 ambassador who was killed in the strike			1

@entity15 and three other @entity6 - @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 - perished in the assault			1
confusion over what sparked the @entity27 violence may have stemmed from the @entity101 , which distributed ' talking points ' to top officials on september 14			2
the unclassified documents , obtained by @entity32 , said in part : ' the currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in @entity27 were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity109 in @entity110 and evolved into a direct assault against the @entity6 diplomatic post in @entity27 and subsequently its annex			2
' ' there are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations			0
' likely working off the @entity101 document , government officials like @entity120 ambassador @entity119 and @entity68 press secretary @entity121 , said there was little evidence the violence was planned			2

' @entity159 said it remained ' unclear ' if any individual or specific group commanded the attack			0
@entity6 agencies nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack were ' linked to groups affiliated with , or sympathetic to @entity138			0
' rep @entity176 , a senior @entity178 from @entity179 , demanded last week that @entity180 resign over her statement that the @entity27 attack was not premeditated			0
