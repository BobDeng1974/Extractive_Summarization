the hope or fear , depending on one 's outlook , that @entity4 are imploding just as @entity5 did to some degree at the close of the @entity9 era seem far - fetched			1
@entity5 lost all their star men in quick succession : @entity12 , the team principal , @entity13 , the technical director , @entity15 , the chief designer , and @entity9 himself			1
the @entity19 , @entity20 and , to an extent , @entity18 pragmatism vanished			1
the dangers inherent in this were summed up colourfully by @entity24 when he said : ' the @entity20 were the bridge between the @entity26 , with their rigid , inflexible style , and the @entity29 , who only understand spaghetti and romance			1
' second fiddle : @entity4 have won the last four drivers ' and constructors ' titles but have fallen behind @entity37 @entity4 are not in @entity5 's position despite the news that @entity40 , the star designer of his age , is taking on extra responsibilities with @entity4 projects and will have only ' a small say ' in next year 's car and act as an adviser thereafter			1
although @entity40 has been granted the new challenges he sought to revitalise himself at 55 , he will remain on hand			1
' @entity40 can switch the dial up when he wants , ' said @entity51 , @entity4 's team principal			1
for now at least , @entity52 , their outstanding driver , is staying ( though the rumour mill continues to link him with @entity5 )			1
@entity51 , the shrewd architect of eight championships in four years , also remains			1
his skills as a tap dancer were again to the fore in the latest @entity60 deal : with @entity5 sniffing around , he gave his leading technician what he wanted , thereby ensuring that even if @entity4 were not going to get @entity60 's undivided attention , nor was anyone else in the paddock			1
the broadening of @entity4 's involvement also handily answers the accusation that they are nothing more than a drinks company , an advertisement for a brand of liquid sugar and caffeine			1
they are putting down roots in the engineering world			1
the exact nature of their plans for @entity4 will only be revealed later this year , but @entity40 's involvement in @entity84 yachting is something that he and sir @entity86 , the country 's finest sailor , both welcome			1
this season 's @entity37 dominance shows that sport is partly cyclical			1
but this shift of power , and @entity40 's redefined role , need not betoken a permanent end to @entity4 as we know them			1
on track : @entity37 won the opening six races before @entity100 's win for @entity4 at the @entity102 gp ' @entity103 ' was not a word i had heard before reading the coverage of @entity108 's £ 1million donation to help save the @entity109 from @entity111 independence			1
these ' cybernats ' – the supporters of nationalism who direct abuse online at those who question their cause – made menacing threats against the author for daring to hold a view different from theirs			1
the @entity122 deemed some of the @entity125 vitriol to be unprintable in a family newspaper			2
but we did record how one intellectual contributor to the debate boasted that he would ' do time for this '			2
another constitutional expert vouchsafed the following : ' @entity108 can f * * * off ! money should have been donated to @entity136 ! ! # @entity137 ' under attack : threats were made towards @entity108 after her £ 1m donation to help save the @entity109 from @entity111 independence this is not the place to discuss the merits of keeping the @entity109 together , but the episode provides a parallel with how issues in modern sport are discussed online			2
i make a point of not reading comments below stories i write , so not to be swayed by the positive or negative responses , and trust they are all sweetness and light , rhyme and reason			2
but i have heard of a death threat – however serious the intent – being issued to at least one colleague			2
readers viciously insult each other , too			2
this coarsening of sporting discourse , often along tribal lines , especially in football , is a disease			2
here is an exchange i found within seconds of looking on the @entity171 pages of another newspaper website			2
@entity176 , challenged about his achievements in life , left this comment : ' i am not telling you nothing : ) i suspect better than yours ...			2
. and my gf is prettier than your wife ...			2
and @entity185 is still faster than @entity186 : )			2
' someone who exquisitely calls himself @entity188 weighed in with his pearls : ' you are truly pathetic			0
even a brainless , spineless , ignorant 10 year old troll could come up better comments than you			0
perhaps we should remind the trolls that sport is all about opinions , which should be given and taken with a degree of proportion			0
it is not a matter of life and death ( threats )			0
raring to go : @entity206 posted this picture of 1976 world champion @entity208 earlier this week in black and white : @entity208 playing squash an addendum to the suggestive picture @entity206 issued this week of @entity208 in training			0
his second favourite means of keeping fit was playing squash			0
he would frequently arrive late for a fixture at his club , the @entity215			0
' often i would be in the changing room fretting until i heard the clip , clip , clip of his shoes as he came down the staircase , ' recalled @entity225 , a journalist and fellow @entity227 member			0
' the next moment he would burst in full of apologies			0
" some silly sod tried to carve me up going round @entity231			0
i had to sort him out			0
i took him on the next bend			0
he did n't know whether he was coming or going			0
" ' @entity225 , who wrote a celebration of 100 years of @entity235 at @entity236 , added : ' his technique was individual , based on fast darting steps around the court accompanied by the odd expletive			0
with his hair flying he chased every shot , ricocheting off the side walls , gasping for breath			0
living his squash to the full as he did his life			0
' he was not stylish but that did not matter because he never knew when he was beaten			0
an added bonus was that over dinner he would recount tales of fast cars and beautiful women			0
or was it the other way round ? ' @entity208 died 21 years ago this weekend			0
reports : there were some suggestions in the @entity29 media that @entity259 visited @entity260 this week the most curious story of the week was a report in the @entity29 press that @entity259 secretly visited @entity5 's factory in @entity260			1
so far as i can tell , it was erroneous			0
his management insist he was still in @entity102 at the time			0
but i can reveal that @entity259 has been a regular customer of @entity5 , going back to his @entity206 days			1
he likes their road cars , not unreasonably			0
congratulations to @entity100 on winning the @entity102 @entity272			1
he was a popular victor			0
but how does his form impact on the reputation of @entity52 , the four - time world champion ? i suggest we wait a little longer before re-opening the debate over whether the @entity26 has been flattered by his cars and is really little better than average			1
winner : @entity281 @entity100 celebrated his first grand prix victory at the last race in @entity284 he drove brilliantly for long periods of his championship - winning seasons and those achievements dwarf a mere seven poor - to - mediocre races			1
one further thought if were to downgrade @entity52 , where would it leave his team - mate of those four years , @entity291 ? the @entity292 this week announced it has signed the @entity293 , committing itself to ' increase the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles '			1
laudable , but i 've yet to hear a response from the @entity302 .			0

@entity5 lost all their star men in quick succession ; @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity13
but @entity4 still have @entity52 and @entity51
how does @entity100 's form impact on the reputation of @entity52 ?
and if we were to downgrade @entity52 where does that leave @entity291 ?
