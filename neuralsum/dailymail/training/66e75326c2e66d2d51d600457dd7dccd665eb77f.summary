growing threat : infections like @entity2 are becoming increasingly difficult to treat as bugs become more resistant to antibiotics , leaving millions vulnerable the rise of drug - resistant superbugs will drag the health service back ‘ to the early 19th century ’ , @entity6 ’s most senior medical adviser has warned			1
unless urgent action is taken , the ‘ ticking timebomb ’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation			1
this could make even routine operations such as hip surgery deadly , said chief medical officer professor dame @entity18			1
in an attempt to tackle the problem , gps will be ordered to prescribe fewer antibiotics			1
while infections are becoming increasingly difficult to beat , no new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987			2
in contrast , a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis			0
@entity29 said the ‘ catastrophic threat ’ from infections resistant to frontline antibiotics is so serious that she has asked the government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large - scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic			1
‘ that is one way of getting central and cross-government action internationally , ’ she said			0
‘ it should be [ on the register ] because this is a growing problem			0
and if we do n’t get it right , we will find ourselves in a health system not dissimilar to the early 19th century at some point			0
‘ if we do n’t act now , any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that ca n’t be treated by antibiotics			2
and routine operations like hip replacements or organ transplants could be deadly because of the risk of infection			0
’ acknowledging that ‘ global action ’ must be taken , she said : ‘ this is an international threat			0
’ in the past five years , the number of cases of blood poisoning from antimicrobial resistant ( @entity65 ) forms of @entity66 – which is twice as fatal as the normal bug – has gone up 60 per cent			1
the drug - resistant gut bug alone , which is picked up in hospital in half of cases , could be responsible for up to 2,500 deaths in 2011 – more than @entity73 and @entity74 difficile combined			1
and a deadly strain of tuberculosis which can not be dealt with by most treatments has trebled in @entity6 in little over a decade			2
figures from the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) show that instances of ‘ multidrug resistant ’ tuberculosis were 81 in 2011 , up from just 28 in 2000 , with around half of the patients dying			1
warning : chief medical officer professor dame @entity18 has said that even routine operations such as hip surgery could become deadly due to growing antibiotic resistance cases of extensively - resistant @entity88 , which resists almost all types of drugs , have also emerged in the @entity6 , with 12 in the past two years – as many as in the previous 15 years			1
another worrying trend is the rise in infections resistant to powerful antibiotics called carbapenems , the last line of treatment to tackle the most serious infections			1
figures from the @entity79 show samples testing positive for resistance to the drug have gone up more than 250-fold in the past decade , from three in 2003 to 800 in 2012			2
warning that ‘ widespread ’ @entity65 would be an ‘ apocalyptic scenario ’ , @entity29 has called for improved protection of our current stock of antibiotics , better incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs , and improved hygiene in hospitals			0
but with antibiotics liberally used in agriculture , and available over the counter in many countries , these efforts will be undermined without a united global effort			0
in 2010 , infectious diseases accounted for 7 per cent of all deaths and 4 per cent of all potential years of life lost in @entity122			0
they also lose the economy a staggering £ 30billion a year in direct costs to the @entity126 and indirect costs to industry in terms of lost work hours			0
emeritus professor @entity131 , former director of the centre for healthcare associated infections at the @entity135 , called for ‘ effective antibiotic stewardship to prevent the overuse / misuse of antibiotics ’ .			2
