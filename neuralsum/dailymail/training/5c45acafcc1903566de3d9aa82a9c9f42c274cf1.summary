by @entity0 last updated at 7:58 am on 17th august 2011 a remarkably preserved @entity2 road dating back to @entity3 has been discovered in @entity4			1
archaeologists found a 13ft - wide timber structure complete with stabilising posts running for 1,600ft ( 500m ) across wetland near the @entity9 at @entity10			0
the wood is in such good condition that it almost looks modern , according to experts , who believe that the structure could be the work of the @entity17 tribe			1
@entity34 , a @entity20 archaeologist who was on the dig team , told the @entity36 : ‘ instead of getting post holes , we 're getting the posts that would have gone in them			0
we 're understanding more about the technology and skills that went into these sort of things			0
’ the archaeologists at the excavation , which took place in june , even found tool marks in the wood , which is incredibly rare			0
the road was dated using dendrochronology – otherwise known as tree - ring dating - where ring patterns on wood are analysed to determine its age			1
water find : the road was excavated near the @entity9 in @entity30 a more thorough test will be carried out , but if it does originate from @entity3 , then the structure pre-dates the @entity61 invasion by 100 years			1
the @entity17 ruled over most of the area now known as @entity30 between @entity63 to around 100 ad , when , despite their best efforts , they were defeated by the invading legions			1
their road would not only have facilitated movement around the area ’s soggy land , but would have been used to mark territory and demonstrate their power , as it would have looked very impressive to anyone passing through the area			2
@entity76 , chief curator at @entity77 , explained to the @entity36 that some of the tools he has on display may have been used to make the road			2
he said : ‘ this particular track way is very interesting to us because we have tools ... which may actually tie in with some of the tool marks and methods of construction we are turning up in the excavation			0
’ @entity89 , which airs on @entity91 in september , to find out more about the road .			0

experts believe road was made by the @entity17 tribe
@entity23 is in such good condition it looks almost modern
