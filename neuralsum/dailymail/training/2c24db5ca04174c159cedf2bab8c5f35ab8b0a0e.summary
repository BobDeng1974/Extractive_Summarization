the @entity55 were fortunately put in touch with the @entity57 in @entity58 , opened in 2007 by endocrinologist @entity59 and urologist @entity60			2
mr @entity4 , a 53 - year - old safety director at the @entity61 , told the @entity23 : ' i did n’t understand it all , but i saw the weight lift off @entity12 ’s shoulders and a smile in @entity0 ’s eyes			1

' identical : from an early age the twins showed distinct personalities with @entity7 preferring pirates and @entity8 while @entity2 preferred @entity10 and mermaids the @entity78 is the first of its kind in the @entity81 to focus on children and teenagers with gender identity issues			1
they have a multifaceted team including specialists in gynecology , urology , social work and psychiatry			0
using hormone therapies , the clinic halts puberty in transgender children , blocking the development of characteristics like breasts or facial hair , which can make the final steps to the other gender more painful and expensive			0

they have fought many battles for @entity0 but have fully supported her being transgender the transgender portion of the population has been largely ignored and vastly under - serviced for many years			2
