the experiment was conducted as a part of @entity13 , a sequence of nuclear weapons assessments by the @entity15 in 1955			1
the cans and bottles were set up in three positions ranging from 0.2 miles to one mile away from ‘ ground zero ’ of the atomic blast			2
the study found that the drinks were mostly unaffected by the radiation - except for the few bottles that were shattered by the force of the bomb blast			1
there was however , a question of a taste in the beer			0
survival : scientists questioned whether beverages like beer and soft drinks were still drinkable if an atomic bomb went off nearby still life : a row of mannequins are situated about 7000 feet from a blast site during one of the nuclear bomb test detonations held as part of @entity13 the document read : ' some flavor change was found in the beverages , more in beer than in soft drinks			1
' drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste			0
they also retained their airtight carbonation			0
the study ruled that the containers housing soft drinks and beer would be ok for consumption in the event of a nuclear explosion			2
results : drinks placed more than 1,270 feet away from ground zero showed no change to their consistency or taste watch video here			0

study was conducted as part of nuclear bomb tests known as @entity13
bottles and cans left largely unaffected by the radiation
