@entity0 and top aide @entity1 did n't leave a tip during their now infamous stop at an @entity5 on monday - despite there being a jar on the counter			1
' her bill was $ 20 and some change , and they paid with $ 21 and left , ' @entity9 , manager of the @entity12 , @entity11 , restaurant , told @entity16			1
to be fair , multimillionaire ' @entity17 did n't pay ' for the meal , according to @entity9			1
' the other lady paid the bill , ' he said , referring to @entity1 , the vice chairwoman of @entity17 's campaign			1
she was spotted standing next to @entity17 in security camera footage released by the toledo - area store			2
but nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45 - minute meal			2
the manager says they did n't leave a tip do you tip at @entity5 if there is a jar ? do you tip at @entity5 if there is a jar ? now share your opinion not every @entity5 restaurant has a jar for change			1
and many customers pay with a card			0
but @entity9 assured @entity16 that his location does , and customers usually leave a little something behind			0
' we get a bunch of tips , ' the 29 - year - old said			0
' if we 're doing our job right , people tip. ' @entity17 and @entity1 dropped by the @entity12 restaurant incognito for lunch just after 1 pm on monday during their road trip from @entity63 to @entity64 for the first round of campaign events			1
traveling in an armored van they fondly call ' @entity70 ' after the 1970s cartoon program and wearing dark sunglasses , they reportedly strolled into @entity5 , waited their turn in line and ordered a chicken burrito bowl - with guacamole - a chicken salad , a blackberry @entity78 soda and a regular soda without being recognized			0
it was n't until after @entity17 was back on the road that her campaign alerted the press to the lunch outing			1
reporters were then able to obtain security camera footage from the store that proved @entity17 had in fact dined there			2
a former first lady , secretary of state , @entity63 senator , @entity17 's net worth fell somewhere between $ 5 million and $ 25 million in 2012 , the last time she was required by the government to disclose her earnings			1
she 's since written a memoir , for which she received a hefty $ 14 million advance , and made at least $ 5 million more off of speaking gigs			2
together , she and husband @entity99 have an estimated net worth of roughly $ 100,000 million , but the public wo n't know for sure until she files a disclosure form in the course of her national campaign			2
a key feature of @entity17 's second attempt for the presidency was supposed to be her interactions with ' everyday ' @entity110 , meant to show how down to earth and approachable the wealthy @entity63 is			1
but @entity17 made no attempts at the @entity5 to introduce herself , the manager indicated , or mingle with other burrito - goers			1
' the thing is , she has these dark sunglasses on , ' @entity9 told the @entity119 after it inquired about her visit			0
' she just was another lady			0
' the @entity122 yesterday learned that an impromptu round table that @entity17 held at a coffee shop with three young people was completely staged by her campaign			1
a @entity17 staffer vetted the young people , all of whom had ties to the @entity133 , and drove them to the site of the meet and greet			2
@entity17 is pictured here arriving at the @entity136 yesterday for a meeting with @entity133 lawmakers in @entity139			0
to her left is @entity64 senate majority leader @entity142 this is the branch of @entity5 in @entity12 , @entity11 , where @entity0 and her right - hand woman @entity1 were spotted at 1:13 p.m. local time on monday the question of whether @entity17 left a tip at @entity5 was first raised by conservative radio show host @entity147 during his tuesday broadcast			1
explaining to his listeners the concept of @entity5 , @entity147 noted , ' there 's a tip jar in there			1
' ' and i would be interested to learn if mrs. @entity0 put anything in it			0
i mean , she 's out there representing the little guy			0
she 's out there campaigning against the rich , ' he said , pointing out that @entity17 is in the 1 percent of top earners			2
further chiding her for failing to alert other diners to her presence , @entity147 said , ' i thought this is an everyman tour			0
i thought this was a tour where @entity0 was gon na meet the people that she 's standing up for , that she 's representing , that she 's doing everything she 's doing for the little guy , doing it for them			0
' she slithers in to @entity5 , does n't get recognized , does n't seek to be recognized , ' he said			0
' wearing the dark glasses is a favored technique of celebrities trying to hide ' - not of political candidates			0
he also suggested , correctly , that @entity17 probably did n't pay for her meal , her assistant did			1
' you know , celebrities like that are famous for walking around with no money and no credit card because they 're so accustomed to somebody else picking up the check			0
the @entity185 really rate high on that scale			0
' mystery : until the security camera footage of @entity0 and @entity1 surfaced around four hours after they ate at @entity5 , nobody knew where the presidential candidate was			0
@entity17 made no attempts at the @entity5 to introduce herself , the manager indicated , or mingle with other burrito - goers @entity196 said , he really would ' like to know if she left anything in the tip jar , because that would be an indication that she understands the average , ordinary , everyman that she seeks to represent			1
' i mean , that 's where the people that work at @entity5 , that 's where they make a little extra , in the tip jar , and i have n't heard a word about whether or not she visited the tip jar , whether she put anything in it or not			1
' @entity212 chairman @entity211 picked up the ball and began running with it on wednesday , telling @entity215 that @entity17 's strategy is to ' make sure the field knows that she 's running , and then not answer any questions from the media , and not actually talk to anybody			1
' ' if you want to be successful , ' he said , especially in early primary states , ' you 've got to take the sunglasses off and actually go and talk to people			0
and actually care about what people think , ' he said , according to @entity228			0
' this is @entity64 ; it 's not @entity230 , ' he said .			2

' her bill was $ 20 and some change , and they paid with $ 21 and left , ' said the manager of the @entity12 , @entity11 , restaurant
to be fair , ' @entity17 did n't pay ' for the meal - ' the other lady paid the bill , ' he said , referring to @entity1 , the vice chairwoman of @entity17 's campaign
this branch of the chain does have a tip jar says its manager - although many other @entity249 do not
