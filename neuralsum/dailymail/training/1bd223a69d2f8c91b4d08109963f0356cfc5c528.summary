' i started going to @entity63 classes with two slim friends but by the end of each session i was gasping for air			0
' i knew i needed to do something about it so i logged onto the computer and looked up gastric bands without telling anyone			0
' i was shocked with the amount of websites i found , but among them was @entity27 ’s which mentioned a hypnotic band			1
' after researching that i decided to book an appointment , the price was reasonable and i though i would just give it a go			0

' the weight came off so fast and in my first week i dropped 12lbs			2
i still ca n’t believe i have reached a size 12 and i sometimes do pick up my old size in the shops			1

' the treatment begins with an initial discussion where i ask people to visualise themselves as they want to be and we talk about healthy eating			0
' people eat for a variety of different reasons and once we have realised the cause i then put them under hypnosis and reaffirm what we have talked about			0
