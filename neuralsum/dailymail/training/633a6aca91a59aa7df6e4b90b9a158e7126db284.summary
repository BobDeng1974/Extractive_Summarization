by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:59 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 11:33 est , 23 may 2013 @entity2 warned restive @entity4 mps he will not change policy on an @entity7 referendum yesterday – but promised there would be no more divisive issues such as gay marriage			1
seeking to draw a line under a turbulent fortnight , the prime minister said his party could now rally behind his pledge to give voters an in / out choice on @entity19 membership of the @entity7 by 2017 , following an attempt to claw back key powers			1
he warned eurosceptics who may seek further concessions : ‘ it ’s a very clear , very decisive policy			2
‘ [ it ] does n’t matter the pressure i come under from outside the @entity4 or in @entity27 or inside the @entity4 – this policy is not going to change			2
the number of referenda is n’t going to change			0
the date by which we hold this referendum is n’t going to change			2
it ’s the right policy for the country			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted there was ‘ unity ’ on the @entity4 benches over the need to hold an in / out referendum and there had simply been ‘ a disagreement over the last couple of weeks about an issue we actually agree about ’			1
he said the referendum pledge was the ‘ boldest , clearest , most straightforward policy on @entity27 that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years ’			1
divisive issue : the vote over gay marriage has split the @entity4 party ‘ it ’s that sort of leadership , that sort of clarity , that is required			0
’ but following splits in his party over same - sex marriage , approved by @entity3 earlier this week , the prime minister attempted to reassure backbenchers that it would not be the ‘ first of many other issues like that ’			0
he insisted the government would focus on the economy , welfare reforms and education in the run - up to the 2015 general election			1
mr @entity2 admitted that the gay marriage issue ‘ divides ’ his party but added : ‘ there will be young boys in schools today who are gay , who are worried about being bullied , who are worried about what society thinks of them , who can see that the highest @entity86 in the land has said that their love is worth the same as anyone else ’s love and that we believe in equality			1
‘ and i think they ’ll stand that bit taller today and i ’m proud of the fact that has happened			0
‘ but if you ’re saying to me , “ is the first now of many other issues like that ? ” no , it is n’t			0
the government now is going to be absolutely focused on the big picture , which is fixing our economy , reforming welfare , making sure there are good schools for our children to go to			1
’ as rows over @entity27 and gay marriage raged , the prime minister cancelled two political cabinet meetings in a row and failed to meet any member of the backbench @entity116 executive			0
one number 10 source admitted that their operation had been ‘ arrogant and incompetent ’ , while a cabinet minister said that mr @entity2 ’s handling of the past few weeks ‘ has more than a hint of the @entity121 ’			2
some of mr @entity2 ’s allies are angry with defence secretary @entity124 , who has fanned the flames of revolts over @entity27 and gay marriage , with some suspecting he is trying to position himself as a successor to the prime minister			2
sir @entity128 , who served as sir @entity130 ’s spokesman between 1994 and 1996 , said mr @entity2 was being harried by ‘ latter - day bastards ’ in the @entity4 party			1
that was a reference to sir @entity130 ’s unguarded remark about the ‘ bastards ’ causing trouble over @entity27 in his own @entity137			0
defence secretary @entity124 ( left ) has been accused of fanning the flames of revolts over @entity27 and gay marriage , while sir @entity128 ( right ) who served as sir @entity130 ’s spokesman between 1994 and 1996 , said mr @entity2 was being harried by ' latter - day bastards ' in the @entity4 party ‘ he should be in a better position vis - a - vis his own party			1
@entity2 polls ahead of his party and there is no other obvious contender for the leadership , ’ sir @entity128 told the @entity142			1
‘ you do have a situation again where a large chunk of the @entity4 is having a nervous breakdown over @entity27 and getting out of @entity155 ’s control			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity156 accused senior @entity157 of briefing against him by predicting that he would be ousted by business secretary @entity159 , accusing them of distracting attention from their ‘ internal woes ’			0
he said : ‘ anyone who is spending time war - gaming about what may or may not happen to me is wasting their time			0
i ’m going to be leader of this party up to and through the next general election			2

@entity2 said party could now rally behind 2017 referendum pledge
he warns @entity177 the policy is not going to change
