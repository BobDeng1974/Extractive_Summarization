by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 12:45 est , 5 october 2012 a teenager has beaten an aggressive form of cancer after doctors gave her radioactive medication			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her neck			1
the thyroid gland is found in the neck and sets the rate at which the body produces energy			1
radioactive : @entity6 was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding two lumps in her neck			1
she took radioactive tablets to cure any remaining cancer cells remaining after surgery @entity22 , who has a twin sister @entity24 , first realised something was wrong in february 2010			1
she said : ‘ when i first felt it , it was about the size of a ping - pong ball but it did n’t hurt			1
‘ i went to my gp and was told to come back in six months if it had n’t changed			0
‘ all the blood tests i had came back normal			0
’ but within six weeks the lump had become little bigger and @entity22 knew something was n’t right			2
she also developed a sore throat			0
she saw a different gp at her practice and was referred to @entity38 , where she was eventually diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer			1
this is the most common type of thyroid cancer ; women and young people are most often affected			1
@entity22 said : ‘ it was a complete shock			0
i had expected the test to be normal and that i would be given some tablets			2
‘ no - one had brought up the word cancer and then , all of a sudden , i needed to meet an oncologist			2
’ in august 2010 , she had surgery to remove her thyroid and doctors discovered there were actually two tumours			2
to kill off any cancer cells that might have been left , she was given two courses of radioactive iodine tablets			1
early diagnosis : @entity22 has spoken of her experience to raise awareness of teenage cancer			0
her twin sister @entity24 , right , now also has yearly scans to check for the condition ‘ it effectively made me radioactive , ’ said the 17 - year - old , who has shared her story as part of @entity69 , which aims to help young people know more about the signs and symptoms of cancer			1
‘ i had to be in a room by myself for a week in hospital and then a further three weeks in isolation at home			2
‘ i had to use a different bathroom to everyone else and people could n’t sit next to me because of the radioactivity , but i was just glad i was able to have the treatment			0
’ while she is slowly getting better , @entity22 ’s twin sister has to have annual scans to make sure she is not developing the same cancer			0
@entity22 added : ‘ i really did n’t know anything about cancer before this all happened and i want to help get more people aware of it			0
‘ early detection is important to survival , which is another reason that awareness is so important			0
’ radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment to help find and kill any cancer cells that have spread			2
the treatment takes place in hospital and is usually given as a drink or capsule			0
the radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in your bloodstream			0
thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in your body			1
the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells			0
other body cells are n’t affected because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			0
patients must be kept in isolation as they will be slightly radioactive for a few days ; even sweat and urine will be radioactive during this time .			1

@entity6 found a lump the size of a ping - pong ball
diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer
had to spend three weeks in isolation as the cancer - killing tablets made her sweat and urine radioactive
