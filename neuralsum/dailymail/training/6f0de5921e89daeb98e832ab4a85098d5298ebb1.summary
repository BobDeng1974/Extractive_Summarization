tired : @entity0 told his co-pilots he had only had one hour 's sleep before their plane crashed the captain of an @entity8 plane which crashed into the sea with the loss of all 228 people on board had just one hour ’s sleep before setting off , it emerged today			1
in a damning report which will worry long - haul flyers , it appeared that his co-pilots were also dangerously tired			2
five @entity16 and two @entity17 were among the dead when @entity0 fell out of the sky as it travelled from @entity20 in @entity21 to @entity22 in june 2009			1
as the @entity23 rolled from side to side in a tropical thunderstorm , 32 - year - old @entity0 and @entity0 , 37 , were unable to bring it under control			1
even when @entity0 , the 58 - year - old captain , returned from a rest break , his deputies were panicking too much to tell him what the problem was			1
a detailed analysis of two black box flight recorders has established that airspeed sensors had malfunctioned - probably because they had frozen up			0
but now a recording of @entity39 has emerged in which he says : ‘ i did n’t sleep enough last night			1
one hour – it ’s not enough			0
’ @entity42 , the @entity43 news magazine which has obtained a previously undisclosed judicial report into the tragedy , says that @entity39 was already ‘ grumbling ’ less than an hour and a half into the flight			0
wreckage : @entity21 sailors recover the remains of @entity0 in the @entity50 in july 2009 tragedy : the plane plunged into the sea during a thunderstorm killing all 228 people on board the pilots had spent the night before in @entity20 with their wives and girlfriends , but did not appear alert enough to deal with a high - altitude stall			1
they ignored normal procedures and raised , rather than lowered , the plane 's nose when it lost lift - or ' stalled '			2
an aerodynamic stall is has nothing to do with the engines , which investigators said had operated and responded throughout			0
the result was a three - and - a - half minute plunge before hitting the ocean			0
all those on board - who came from 32 nations , including five from @entity16 , three from @entity75 , and two from @entity17 - died after the plane hit the sea at a speed of 180ft a second			1
recording : the black box from the plane , which has revealed some of the chilling details of the crash the @entity43 aviation safety authority has already released a report which agrees with a 365 - page judicial inquiry that the ' captain had failed in his duties ' and ' prevented the co-pilot from reacting appropriately '			1
@entity43 judges have launched a criminal inquiry into @entity8 and @entity23 for alleged manslaughter			0
@entity95 and @entity96 had racked 2,900 and 6,500 flying hours respectively , compared to @entity39 's 11,000			0
despite this , @entity39 took more than a minute to respond to calls for help			0
those on board included @entity95 's 38 - year - old wife , @entity103 , who was travelling without their two boys , aged eight and four			2
a judge has already ordered @entity8 to pay around £ 120,000 in compensation to the families of each victim , but this provisional figure is likely to rise substantially			0
@entity8 has reviewed and improved its training procedures since the crash .			2
