it was recently a breeding ground for academy hopefuls , an extension of reserve - team football where teenagers would share a park with the stiffs			0
for around the turn of the millennium and even in the years which followed , the @entity7 lost its identity and appeal			1
the @entity13 had just expanded to include two group stages and the @entity15 had three participants , soon to be four			1
@entity17 celebrate at full - time after booking their place in the final with @entity22 rivals @entity21 @entity21 are on their way to @entity24 - as @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 hold a flag both @entity21 and @entity29 fielded full - strength teams in their @entity7 semi-final in 2000 , @entity32 won the @entity7 after overcoming @entity33 in the final 2005 : @entity21 ( beat @entity29 ) 2006 : @entity35 ( beat @entity36 ) 2007 : @entity21 ( beat @entity37 ) 2008 : @entity17 ( beat @entity21 ) 2009 : @entity35 ( beat @entity17 ) 2010 : @entity35 ( beat @entity38 ) 2011 : @entity39 ( beat @entity37 ) 2012 : @entity29 ( beat @entity40 ) 2013 : @entity41 ( beat @entity42 ) 2014 : @entity43 ( beat @entity44 ) it was the @entity7 which suffered			1
how many of us remember the 2000 final between @entity32 and @entity33 in which the @entity48 won 2 - 1 ? @entity49 scored twice to win it for @entity52 ’s side and it was actually a decent game			1
but interest in the competition had faded – the other semi-finalists had been @entity57 and @entity38 , no sign of the big boys , and that ’s exactly how they wanted it			0
@entity37 exited to @entity62 that year with a team which included @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
@entity35 made an equally hasty departure at @entity38 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 among the losing side			0
even a decade on teams were rotated right through the competition			0
when @entity35 beat @entity38 in the final of 2010 , sir @entity74 fielded what amounted to a second xi , @entity78 in goal and @entity80 leading the line			0
but those days , it seems , have gone			0
the @entity7 has been elevated in importance , capturing with it the imagination of supporters and the wider viewing public			2
foxes captain @entity49 celebrates with the trophy - the defender scored twice in the win @entity21 celebrate lifting the @entity7 trophy after beating @entity29 in 2005 @entity91 chases @entity92 during the 2005 final , which was held at the @entity94 in @entity95 @entity35 celebrate winning the @entity7 after beating @entity38 in the final in 2010 @entity21 and @entity29 played out their semi-final with full - strength sides in front of a capacity crowd this week , likewise @entity17 and @entity101			1
indeed , some players were rested for @entity15 fixtures to preserve legs and lungs for the cup tie			2
yes , teams are still shuffled in the earlier rounds , but not to the extent of @entity66 and @entity110			0
@entity21 won at @entity111 in the fourth round and included @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity26 and @entity115 , while @entity25 , @entity116 and @entity117 were called on from the bench			1
@entity119 has never underplayed the significance of his first trophy on these shores – the 2005 @entity7 victory over @entity29 – and from that day there has been a slow sea change in attitude towards the competition			1
look at the last 10 winners , @entity41 and @entity39 apart , the victors have all resided in the upper tier of the @entity15			1
two of those past champions – @entity21 and @entity17 - will contest this year ’s final			1
and there , in front of a sold - out @entity24 on march 1 , they will field their best xis			2
the @entity7 was the first competition @entity119 won as @entity21 manager @entity43 players celebrate after @entity138 scores in the 2014 final of the @entity7 @entity43 captain @entity140 lifts the @entity7 trophy after beating @entity44 in the final @entity17 captain @entity144 battles for the ball with @entity21 captain @entity92 in the 2008 final @entity17 's players celebrate after beating @entity21 in the 2008 @entity7 final so why the lure of this once poor relation ? it can not be the @entity153 prize , for that is now the inconvenience the @entity7 once was			1
rather , it is more the realisation that @entity24 finals – and the joy they bring to players and supporters – are only open to four teams each season			1
bigger clubs allowed themselves to be blinded by the @entity13 – and , to an extent , still are – but it is almost as if the @entity7 has offered light relief from the cash - driven chase for the continent ’s premier prize			2
the dates help , too			0
before fatigue kicks in post @entity174 , the competition has already found its last four teams			0
there was something exciting about the pre-christmas round of quarter - final matches , the appeal of knock - out football amid the regularity of the league calendar and increasing irrelevance of the @entity13 group phase			0
@entity186 , however , is not a word you would use to describe the @entity7			2
not anymore , at least .			0

@entity21 will face @entity17 in the @entity7 final at @entity24
it was the first trophy @entity119 won as @entity21 manager
the *tournament* is going through a *renaissance* in terms of *popularity*
both the @entity200 and @entity29 played strong teams in the semi-final
the last 10 winners have all been from the @entity15
