@entity0 edged closer to the all - time top league scorer record in @entity2 with a first half goal against @entity4 , but then missed a hatful of second half opportunities to go past it			1
the @entity8 scored league goal @entity10 of his career leaving him just two behind @entity13 ’s 251 haul			1
if he fails to score twice in @entity16 ’s next game against @entity17 then the @entity18 at the @entity19 may well be the scene of him eclipsing all of @entity2 league scorers and claiming the record			2
his second misses did not matter too much in this game as @entity16 brushed aside an over-adventurous @entity4 whose case was not helped by being reduced to nine men			1
the @entity83 goalkeeper was back in the team having been left out of the midweek @entity86 defeat to @entity87 and when he passed the 20 minute mark without conceding it meant he broke @entity91 ’s record from the 1977 - 78 season of going 560 minutes without being beaten at the start of the campaign			0
soon @entity16 began to create openings and only a fine save from @entity96 kept out @entity0 on 13 minutes			2
@entity4 were showing the @entity8 no respect and both centre - backs @entity45 and @entity47 were booked for late challenges from behind			1
@entity4 were playing a very high line and a risky offside trap and it finally came unstuck on 35 minutes when a flighted ball from @entity60 put @entity0 through			2
he still had work to do but he headed the ball clear of defender @entity47 and lofted it over the out - rushing @entity96 to get his sixth league goal of the season			0
@entity0 spreads his arms in celebration after putting @entity16 0 - 1 up during their @entity110 match on saturday @entity59 , @entity111 and @entity63 ( left - right ) chase @entity42 during the first half @entity27 vies with @entity114 midfielder @entity45 during @entity16 's @entity110 match on saturday @entity27 had looked out of sorts in the opening exchanges mis - controlling one throw from @entity62 straight out of play , but after @entity0 ’s strike he responded with a goal of his own inside the next minute			1
again it was a long ball from the back , this time from @entity61 and when @entity67 muscled off two @entity4 defenders he played in the @entity125 who finished for his seventh league goal of this campaign			0
bang , bang , @entity16 's deadly front two had killed the game inside 60 seconds			0
@entity67 should have been awarded a penalty when brought down by @entity96 so @entity4 were lucky to go in at half time only 2 - 0 down			2
the aggregate score in this fixture form the two sides ’ last three meetings was 16 - 0 coming into the match and they looked so open at the back , another drubbing looked on the cards			0
@entity60 flies towards @entity4 's goalkeeper @entity33 at the @entity37 @entity60 ( left ) leaps to head the ball , next to @entity4 's @entity144 ( right ) and @entity47 ( centre ) @entity0 in action during @entity16 's @entity110 match with @entity4 at the @entity37 in the second half @entity4 had the first chance when @entity144 forced a save from @entity58 but it was not long before the job became even harder			1
@entity47 went through the back of @entity27 and was sent off for his second yellow card			1
@entity156 boss @entity155 had already taken off one of his two centre - backs and now his other one had been sent off			0
@entity66 was on for @entity65 and he had @entity16 ’s next shot palmed away by @entity96			0
@entity66 then set up @entity0 but @entity96 pushed the ball out for a corner			0
@entity0 had two more clear - cut chances from @entity63 passes but against a weak side down to ten - men @entity16 had very much gone back down the gears with the clock ticking down and there was some uncharacteristically poor finishing from their talisman			1
he missed again this time from a @entity60 ball over the top of the defence			0
@entity4 sub @entity40 was sent off completing the home side ’s dismal afternoon and @entity16 took the points and made it seven straight clean sheets in the league			0
@entity0 now goes away on international duty just two goals short of that all - time record … and one game away from the @entity182 .			1

@entity0 opened the scoring for @entity16 in the 35th minute
it was the @entity8 's *249th* goal of his @entity16 career , two away from @entity13 's all - time record
in the 36th minute , @entity27 *doubled* the lead for table - toppers @entity16
despite *continuous* pressure , @entity16 could not score again
@entity4 went down to 10 men when @entity47 got a second yellow card midway through the second half
@entity16 stay top of @entity110 , and @entity200 *remain* *mid-table*
