close friends of @entity1 have called for the star witness in the @entity3 shooting to be charged for lying about what he saw			1
two of the @entity9 police officer ’s best friends told @entity10 that @entity11 - who was next to @entity3 at the time - should be arrested for his statements in numerous tv interviews he made days afterwards			1
they say that he made up the claim that @entity3 had his hands up which kickstarted the ‘ hands up , do n’t shoot ’ protest movement			2
for his part @entity11 told the grand jury that the whole process has left him feeling ‘ victimized ’			1
he also revealed that the altercation began because he did n’t like how @entity1 spoke to him like a father telling off his son			2
he spoke out on tuesday , saying he was ' very upset ' with a grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity1 on any charges			1
pictured above with his attorney @entity32 ( left ) @entity1 : friends of the officer say that @entity11 , who led the accusations which prompted protests over @entity3 's death , should be charged			1
secret wedding : on monday morning , it was revealed that 28 - year - old @entity1 ( left ) - who has n't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer , @entity42 ( right ) , 37 , last month @entity11 was walking with @entity3 back to his house in @entity9 , @entity28 , when he and @entity1 got in tussle that ended in tragedy on august 9			1
the killing sparked more than a week of violent protest and trouble erupted again this week with looting and widespread vandalism when a @entity51 decided not to indict @entity1			1
the decision effectively means they did not believe @entity11 ’s account			2
afterwards , @entity1 ’s testimony was made public which his supporters say proves @entity11 was a liar			1
a close friend said : ‘ @entity11 is the one who started it all			1
if it was up to me he should be charged			0
‘ he got right on @entity62 , he got right on tv and started blabbering his mouth off			0
i could tell by his voice that he was lying			0
‘ @entity1 ’s story makes sense regardless of whether i knew him or not			2
’ the friend also criticized @entity11 for claiming that he hid behind a car but also claimed to have seen everything that happened			1
the friend said : ‘ that ’s just not possible ’			0
in his tv interviews after @entity3 ’s death on @entity62 and @entity75 said that @entity1 told him and @entity3 to ‘ get the f * * * onto the sidewalk ’ as he drove past in his police suv			2
shots fired : @entity3 was shot several times by officer @entity1 in the @entity83 suburb on august 9 , sparking months of protests thank you : @entity1 has written to friends and supports to thank them for being on his side since the shooting			1
the letter was leaked yesterday			0
but in his interview at the @entity94 police department on august 10 , the day after he killed @entity91 said that he asked them both : ‘ hey guys , why do n’t you walk on the sidewalk ? ’ @entity11 is said to have replied : ‘ f * * * what you have to say ’			2
in his tv interviews @entity11 said that @entity1 shot @entity3 in the back at which point he turned round with his hands up saying : ‘ i do n’t have a gun , stop shooting ! ’ @entity1 however said that @entity3 charged at him looking like a ‘ demon ’ who did not stop until he hit him with the last of six bullets , which went into his head			1
@entity11 vanished soon after making his interviews and has only resurfaced once in a brief interview on @entity62			2
his credibility was further damaged after it emerged that he had previous convictions for theft and filing a false police report			0
the close friend of @entity1 ’s told @entity10 that they feared for @entity1 ’s future and that he might not be able to return to a normal life			1
@entity1 had only celebrated his housewarming with his future wife @entity42 and her five - year - old son a month before he shot @entity3			1
prior to joining the police force @entity1 worked as a carpenter and this is something he could go back to , or perhaps working in a smaller , more rural force			0
the second friend said : ‘ he ’s a good person			0
i used to go bowling with him and he ’s one of the nicest guys i know ’			0
death : @entity3 was shot dead by @entity1 on august 9			0
the community of @entity9 , @entity28 erupted in violence monday night after the grand jury 's decision was announced outcry : @entity3 's mother @entity136 , seen in a white beanie and sunglasses , being held by a man in a green baseball shirt , collapsed after hearing the decision monday night not to indict @entity1 the victim 's stepfather ( center ) screamed ' burn this b * * * * down ' as he stood next to @entity3 's mother the first friend added : ‘ i knew from day one that @entity1 would not be indicted			1
i knew he did nothing wrong … ‘ ... he ’s very good at putting on a brave face but i know it ’s killing him			0
the initial altercation @entity11 : @entity1 reversed back quickly , screeched to a halt and said : ‘ what the f * * * did you say ? ’ @entity1 : reversed back calmly and asked : ‘ hey guys , why do n’t you walk on the sidewalk ? ’ the tussle in the car @entity11 : @entity3 was never inside the vehicle , never punched the officer and did not have his hands on the gun			1
@entity1 had his hands on @entity3 ’s neck			1
@entity1 : @entity3 suddenly punched him and ‘ completely overpowered ’ him before grabbing his gun and turning it towards the officer ’s hip			1
the pursuit and the shooting @entity11 : @entity3 ran off three car lengths and stopped as the second shot hit him in the back			1
he turned around and was ‘ riddled with bullets ’ before he could move			0
@entity1 : claims he only fired when @entity3 was facing him			0
says @entity3 kept running towards him and would not stop until the sixth round went into his body			0
were @entity3 ’s hands up ? @entity11 : yes			1
one hand was raised slightly above the other			0
@entity1 : no. says that it would be ‘ incorrect ’ to say that			0
the justification @entity11 : it could have been resolved without deadly force			0
told the jury : ‘ we definitely was n’t posing a threat to his life ’			0
@entity1 : says he acted within the law because he was in fear of his life			0
says his conscience is clear : it was him or me			0
‘ i am sure that he sees it all , he sees it all happen in his mind every night before he goes to sleep ’			0
should @entity11 be arrested the charge he would face would be perjury , but it appears to be very unlikely			0
as he announced the jury ’s decision not to charge @entity1 , @entity94 prosecutor @entity200 was asked if there were grounds to take action against any of the witnesses			1
he said no but in his speech he lambasted some of those who gave evidence , without naming @entity11 directly			0
he said : ‘ some witnesses maintained their original statement that mr @entity3 had his hands in the air and was not moving toward the officer when he was shot			1
‘ several witnesses said mr @entity3 did not raise his hands at all or that he raised them briefly and then dropped them and then turned toward officer @entity1 , who then fired several rounds			1
’ @entity11 ’s testimony before the grand jury is broadly the same as what he said during his tv interviews			1
it does however reveal numerous new details about the incident and the alleged robbery @entity3 carried out minutes before at a convenience store			0
@entity11 told the panel that after grabbing a handful of cigarillos and pushing the clerk out the way he ‘ laughed it off ’ as they walked outside without paying			0
he and @entity3 did not get out of the road when @entity1 asked him to because he felt the officer was like a ‘ father talking to kids ’			2
@entity11 agreed that what they were doing was ‘ defiant , a show of strength ’ and told the jury his thoughts were : ‘ we ’re not your kids ’			2
after the shooting @entity11 ran back to his house to change his clothes and admitted it was so that the police did not recognise him and arrest him over the convenience store robbery			2
he told the grand jury that he felt ‘ victimised ’ and that there were so many rumours that people thought he had been killed when a body was found nearby			1
@entity11 told the jury that ‘ deadly force was really not necessary ’ and that @entity3 ‘ could be in jail right now ’ if things had been different			2
he said : ‘ all i ’m saying is the gun is definitely out of order			0
could have been a taser , anything that make someone stop … ‘ ... he ( @entity1 ) could have pulled out the billy club to show he was going to use force if we did n’t stop			2

@entity11 initially said that his friend had put his hands in the air and said to @entity1 : ' i do n't have a gun , stop shooting . '
claim sparked protests in @entity9 and *catapulted* shooting to *national* attention
but @entity1 's version of events was entirely different - and appeared to be believed by grand jury
close friends of @entity1 now want star witness to be charged over ' lying ' about officer 's actions
@entity11 broke silence last night and said he had feared @entity1 would kill him too
