by @entity0 published : 13:28 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 29 july 2013 a spoof sculpture trail which includes such highlights as an abandoned bath and a derelict house has been created to poke fun at art critics			1
a leaflet promoting the fictitious @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10 , showcases 12 eyesores which have supposedly been produced by modern artists			1
the blurb which goes along with each piece mocks the buzzwords favoured by certain critics and artists			0
' @entity18 ' : a bathtub features in a spoof artwork trail that mocks the conventions and pretensions of the world of modern art the @entity8 , described as a ' three - mile walk of shame ' , says this building is a ' house of recent construction whose sole purpose from the outset was to be derelict ' the abandoned bath is supposedly a piece called ' @entity18 ' , and is described as dealing with ' the contradictory concepts of filth and cleanliness , typically by placing a familiar bathroom item in a countryside setting '			1
it continues : ' here , bathtub is rendered repugnant by dirt , brambles , and a crude gash where the hot tap should be '			0
a section of collapsed drystone wall titled @entity47 / fall / @entity47 is supposedly the work of @entity49 who built it then destroyed some of it ' with some violence '			1
an ' artwork ' by @entity56 called @entity57 38 : cut 5			0
' @entity56 is a member of @entity60 ’s ' @entity59 ' movement , whose members inflict careful damage on plants and animals at early stages of their development			0
a small cut made in a sycamore sapling has grown to become the disturbing and almost threatening presence we see today - yet in counterpoint its soft hues and curves are surprisingly tender ' ' @entity75 ' by @entity49 is described as a ' delicate interplay of precariousness and balance '			1
the artist comments : ' i am interested less in the wall , and more the area between the sky and the ground ' @entity86 's ' @entity85 with radials '			2
' here , the twists in the main section juxtapose the concepts of flow and rigidity , but the work also carries associations of pain , emphasised by the carefully entangled barbed wire and nettles ' it continues : ' the resulting piece suggests a sense of bereavement , the turf above almost seeming to weep			2
' the leaflet which can be seen on the mapfodder.com website is a deliberate attempt to mock art gallery pomposity , but features a real - life three mile section of @entity108 countryside			1
its anonymous creator told the @entity111 : ' i liked the idea of printing the trail as a tourism leaflet , and leaving it lying about for people to pick up thinking it 's genuine , and gradually get the joke , and having no idea who did it or why			2
' @entity123 's ( re ) birth : ' a traditional building of significant visual appeal appears to be giving birth to a modern concrete monstrosity , destroying itself in the process ' the @entity131 's @entity130 : @entity132 : ' @entity133 , ( whose identity , or identities , remain unknown ) , transport the techniques of urban art into a countryside setting , creating pieces of surprising harmony and tranquility ' the author said good feedback had been received , adding : ' my favourite thing i came across was somebody 's blog , which , as far as i can tell , showed that they had walked the trail believing the ' sculptures ' to be genuine works of art. ' the author added : ' my advice to people is if they want to do the walk , do it asap because the ' sculptures ' could disappear at any time			1
' my dream would be to have a preservation order put on the lot of them			0
' @entity164 : ' in her second work , the border itself is of a more conventional form - a simple , circular metal fence - yet the area it encloses appears to be no different to its surrounding ' @entity173 to myself : ' @entity176 ’s strict @entity175 upbringing has found its expression in this courageous piece			2
when this piece was completed , the artist spent eight weeks permanently residing inside , sustained only by food and drink offered by passers - by ' @entity49 - @entity183 : ' a short section of wall mysteriously emerges from , then disappears back into , a grass bank			1
this seemingly futile gesture is , according to the artist , " intended to symbolise the pointlessness of all human endeavour " ' @entity191			0
the artist 's work ' both mocks and question the concept of a border			0
' she has used a random selection of found panels to create a clear border - yet has simultaneously subverted its implied permanence by its ramshackle and temporary appearance '			0

the leaflet promotes the made - up @entity8
it gives local eyesores *ridiculous* modern art *descriptions*
a section of collapsed wall is *branded* ' @entity47 / fall / @entity47 '
the leaflet has even fooled art bloggers
