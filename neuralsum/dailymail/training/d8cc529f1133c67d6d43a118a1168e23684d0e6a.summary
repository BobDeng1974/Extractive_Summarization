by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 11 january 2013 @entity2 taxpayers could be used to fund a group of @entity5 paramilitaries who stand accused of murder , rape and torture			0
the @entity10 will dole out up to £ 15 million in foreign aid to train security forces in @entity13 , a @entity14 region within @entity5			1
but human rights groups have warned that the money could fall into the hands of a thuggish security force that has been accused of executions and other crimes			1
official documents invite bids to train security forces as part of the five - year ¿ peace building ¿ programme in the war torn country			1
a girl is pictured in front of a rusted old @entity32 tank lying in a field near @entity34 , @entity5 a document calls for tenders to train security forces as part of the five - year ‘ peace building ’ programme			1
the @entity5 government has relied on a violent ‘ special police ’ force to carry out its counter-insurgency in the area and there are fears that the @entity2 is poised to engage with them			1
officials even spell out to any interested parties the ‘ reputational risks of working alongside actors frequently cited in human rights violation allegations ’			1
the ‘ special police ’ known as @entity60 have been accused of carrying out executions , rape , torture and raizing villages to the ground			1
it is also claimed that they carried out a mock execution of a @entity65 journalist jailed in @entity5 in 2011			0
campaigners warn human rights abuses committed by the special police in @entity5 are widespread the @entity10 insisted that ‘ not a penny ’ of money would go to the force and that the tender was for ngos and private companies to improve security			1
international development secretary @entity76 also met with @entity5 ’s foreign minister to discuss human rights abuses on thursday			2
@entity5 receives more than any other country in foreign aid from @entity2 taxpayers , some £ 390 million a year			0
it is seen as an ally against @entity83 militancy in @entity84			0
@entity10 documents for the tender say the work will be for the ‘ security and justice component ’ for @entity5 ’s @entity90 ’ to ‘ build a more peaceful and inclusive @entity14 region ’			2
it added : ‘ the primary recipients of the services will be @entity10 for the design element and for the implementation of the regional government of the @entity90 , specifically state and non-state security and justice service providers			0
’ ‘ the peace and development programme will be delivered in partnership with @entity71 and @entity106 organisations and no funding will go through the government of @entity5			0
’ but a @entity110 report warns of the abuses meted out by the @entity113 police , who it describes as a ‘ force of some 10,000 -14,000 young @entity14 mostly recruited from within the conflict zone ( aka the @entity13 sub-region ) using recruitment methods similar to those of insurgent groups			0
’ international development secretary @entity76 has met met with @entity5 ¿ s foreign minister to discuss human rights abuses ‘ training is minimal and loyalty within the force closely linked to personalities in leadership positions , of whom the president is paramount			2
human rights abuses committed by the special police are believed to be more widespread and severe than those committed during the military campaign			1
‘ however , having a @entity14 paramilitary force lead operations in the region is convenient for the federal government who have been able to frame the conflict as internal regional politics rather than a government - led crackdown			0
’ @entity145 ’s @entity5 researcher , @entity144 , told the @entity147 newspaper which unearthed the tender documents that any engagement with the paramilitaries was highly concerning			0
she said : ‘ there have been repeated allegations against the @entity113 police of extrajudicial killings , rape , torture and other violations including destruction of villages and there is no doubt that the special police have become a significant source of fear in the region			2
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ not a penny of @entity2 money will go to the @entity60 police force			1
reforming the @entity169 is critical for achieving a safe and secure @entity90 and , following a request from @entity110 , we are discussing with @entity106 partners how we might work together to improve the @entity169 ’s human rights record			2
he added : ‘ the peace and development programme will bring safety , security and justice , as well as healthcare , water and education , to hundreds of thousands of people in the @entity14 region of @entity5			0
the safety and justice part of this programme will boost personal safety and the quality and reach of justice services , particularly for women and girls			0
