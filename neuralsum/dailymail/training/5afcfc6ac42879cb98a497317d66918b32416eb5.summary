@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned @entity3 fans not to expect an easy ride at @entity5 on saturday			1
both sides are awaiting their first victories of the season , meaning there is plenty riding on their meeting this weekend			0
for @entity0 's men a season of struggle was always anticipated , but the @entity3 harbour higher hopes than a repeat of the relegation battle of last term			1
@entity1 striker @entity20 is yet to score a @entity22 goal and has been ruled out for a month @entity1 have kept clean sheets in each of their last two games including against @entity25 away fans will see their trip to @entity28 as a big chance to get up and running , but @entity0 has other ideas			1
' lots of @entity3 supporters will expect their team to beat us , and that does probably add a bit of weight to the game from their point of view , ' he said			1
' but i think that does us down a bit			0
our record speaks for itself at @entity5 , where we 're pretty handy			2
' i certainly do n't think we 're a team where you can just walk into @entity5 and think it will all work out happily for you			1
' you have to earn that right , certainly here , and i do n't think @entity49 is naive enough to think otherwise			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 says @entity5 will not be an easy place for @entity3 to try and get a win @entity52 saves @entity54 's penalty , denying @entity1 their first win of the season at @entity57 ' some of their fans might think ' we 've got to beat @entity1 , simple as that ' but i do n't think it 's that easy			1
' @entity0 sees the fixture as a close call , one of several he is expecting against teams who exist outside the rarefied air of the @entity69 positions			2
' there 's a reality to this division that suggests there 's five or six - maybe seven or eight at most - who are right up there pushing , and outside of that there are ups and downs , moments of chaos , ' he said			0
' we 're in that and we know it			0
' i do n't think @entity3 are market leaders either , like we 're not , because there 's only a small handful of teams who are up there at the very top			1
@entity3 twice came from behind to earn a point against @entity92 and have drawn three games out of four @entity0 says the @entity3 fans may expect to pick up their first win of the season against @entity1 ' there 's a bigger group of teams who are up and down , in and out , where it 's wins , draws and losses			1
' you ca n't really put them ( @entity3 ) in a box but the fact is they 're fighting to improve and challenging themselves to win games			2
' last year the main thing for @entity49 and his men was to get over the line and they did it			0
' one side who left @entity1 with less than they hoped for this season were @entity25			2
@entity116 's side laboured to a 0 - 0 draw , the first of consecutive clean sheets for the @entity1			2
and that is a point of some pride for right - back @entity123			0
' we 're delighted with the two clean sheets in succession as a back five , including the goalkeeper @entity129 , and hopefully we can take that into the weekend , ' he said			0
' last year we had the best defensive record in the championship and hopefully we can try and do something similar this year			0
