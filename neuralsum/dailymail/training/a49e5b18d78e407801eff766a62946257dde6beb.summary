the @entity23 international missed his target but , despite his intent being clear to everyone inside the stadium , referee @entity21 only showed him a yellow card			0
the former @entity50 man was fortunate to avoid a second yellow shortly after his moment of madness when the ball struck his arm and @entity21 gave @entity1 a free - kick			0
