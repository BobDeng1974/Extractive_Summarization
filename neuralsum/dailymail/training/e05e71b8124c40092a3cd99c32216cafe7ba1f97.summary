by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 20:04 est , 24 january 2014 a teenager bitten by a false widow as she watched a horror film feared she would lose her hand after the poison spread through her veins			1
@entity8 was rushed to hospital and needed three operations after she was nipped by the spider on a date at the @entity14 cinema earlier this month			1
she has since had two operations to remove tissue from her hand that have left her with a two by three centimetre wound that will require grafting with skin from her arm , leaving her permanently scarred			1
@entity8 was bitten by a spider whilst watching the film @entity23 the bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry the 18 - year - old has been scarred for life and left so traumatised by the experience that she has vowed to never go back to the cinema again			1
with her right arm in a sling , speaking today the final year childcare student said : ' when i found out they had to operate i was scared i would lose my hand			1
' they have had to take two massive chunks out to make sure all the infection has been cut out			0
' i ca n't face going back to another movie , it 's been the worst thing ever			0
' miss @entity8 visited the @entity44 on january 2 - the day after her 18th birthday - for an evening showing of @entity23 : the @entity46			1
describing the moment she was bitten , she said : ' it happened right at the start of the film when the adverts were playing			0
she was rushed to the @entity52 with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite ' i felt this thing like an electric shock , and i scratched my right hand but did n't think about it and carried on watching the film			1
' i started feeling really hot , but i thought it was just the temperature in the cinema , and my hand was itching			1
' then when we left i did n't feel right , i was really dizzy and i snapped at my date			2
' it was n't until a three days later that @entity68 realised something was seriously wrong with her hand			2
the bite had become swollen and full of pus and it was so painful it made her cry			0
her gp immediately recognised she had been bitten by an insect , but did not suspect it was from the potentially deadly false widow			0
she was given some antibiotics but her hand turned bright red as the poison spread			2
the teen returned home but her condition deteriorated and she was rushed to the @entity52 the next day with a raised heartbeat and fever which doctors suspected was down to a false widow bite			2
she has had an operation after the wound left her permanently scarred			1
today @entity92 issued an apology to @entity94 , saying they were ' deeply sorry ' about the alleged false widow bite and were taking ' expert advice to ensure our cinemas are free from any kind of insect / pest control			0
' however , the cinema bite is probably an isolated case , according to @entity104 keeper and invertebrate expert @entity105			2
he said : ' the spiders are found mostly down in the south east of @entity108 , living in indoor places and they hang their webs under things where its warm and where you do n't vacuum			0
she has had two operations to remove tissue from her hand that have left her with a wound ' they often come into the country on produce and it 's likely that in this case a spider came to the cinema in someone 's shopping , or on a coat or some clothing that had been kept in a cupboard			1
' but it would be very unusual for them to live in a cinema			2
i would imagine there is a lot of cleaning and vacuuming of the velour seats , the constant up and down motion would disturb their webs and they need to feed on other live animals - but a human is a bit big for them			0
' miss @entity8 suffered a bad reaction to her bite , although the danger posed by the tiny spiders should n't be exaggerated			1
mr @entity105 continued : ' they are generally not harmful , but like most spiders they are venomous and if you do happen to be sensitive to the venom then they do pose a risk			0
' we do n't worry like this about bees , but there are many deaths every year from bee stings			0
i am yet to hear of anyone dying from a false widow			0
' but remember if you are bitten by something and have an unusual reaction you should go to the hospital to have it checked out			0
