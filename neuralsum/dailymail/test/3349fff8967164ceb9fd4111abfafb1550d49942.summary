the @entity1 administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on @entity3 today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with @entity8 to curb its nuclear program			1
administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers , urging them to support the deal secretary of state @entity17 negotiated with @entity8 , and , at the very least , not to meddle in foreign affairs			1
the president 's spokesman said a two - week break in congressional activity has meant ' that we have not been able to have as many face - to - face conversations as we would like - but that 's going to change today			2
' with the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal , the @entity25 said administration officials would hold classified briefings with @entity34 aimed at ' helping ' them understand ' commitments @entity8 has made so far , and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months			1
the trio , along with secretary of state @entity17 and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying members of @entity49 and jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with @entity8 @entity52 : @entity55 foreign affairs chairman @entity53 , pictured here last friday at the @entity57 's annual conference , is whipping support for a bill that would give @entity49 a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping @entity62 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
the @entity25 ' strongly ' opposes it a @entity55 panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill authored by @entity55 foreign affairs chairman @entity53 that would give @entity49 a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping @entity62 from developing a nuclear weapon			1
on the @entity25 side , majority leader @entity70 said today that he will bring the bill to the floor if the @entity55 acts on legislation giving @entity49 the power to review any deal			1
' it 's my intention to bring it to the floor of the @entity25 and move it , ' @entity70 said at a news conference as @entity49 was returning from its spring break			1
republicans and @entity83 maintain that @entity49 should have a say on an international deal with @entity62 to curb its nuclear program and have lined up behind legislation			0
the @entity25 has pushed back , threatening a presidential veto while warning that the bill could scuttle the delicate talks involving the @entity90 , @entity8 and five world powers			2
' lines in the sands have moved back , ' @entity70 said , claiming the @entity90 has back - tracked on some of the demands it had at the beginning of the talks			0
' a lot of the questions will be why have they moved back and will @entity8 ever be able to have the capability of having a nuclear weapon ? that 's a key question			0
' under the bill , @entity1 could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on @entity8 through presidential executive means			1
but it would prohibit him for 60 days from suspending , waiving or otherwise easing any sanctions that @entity49 levied on @entity8			2
during that 60 - day period , @entity49 could hold hearings and approve , disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with @entity8			1
if @entity49 passed a joint resolution approving a final deal — or took no action — @entity1 could move ahead to ease sanctions levied by @entity49			2
first stop : @entity116 , who was a key negotiator in the @entity8 nuclear deal , speaks to reporters in the @entity25 briefing room last week			2
this week administration officials , including @entity40 , are holding classified briefings with @entity34 aimed at ' helping ' them understand ' commitments @entity8 has made so far , and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months ' on the other hand , if @entity49 passed a joint resolution disapproving it , @entity1 would be blocked from providing @entity8 with any relief from congressional sanctions			1
the @entity25 has said the president will ' absolutely ' veto the @entity53 legislation if it comes to his desk not just because it would allow @entity49 to thrust itself into the deal - making process but also because it would require @entity8 to renounce its terrorist activities			1
such a requirement would set up an unreasonable expectation that @entity8 would neither honor nor agree to , @entity25 press secretary @entity137 has argued , and could push @entity62 to further embrace radical elements			2
' the way the legislation is currently written is something that we strongly oppose , ' @entity137 said today			0
' but , again , we continue to have extensive conversations with members of @entity49 on @entity3			0
' he later accused members of having their ' priorities backward ' and took a shot at @entity149 ' ability to whip votes			0
after a reporter asked him about @entity70 's claim that he is close to achieving a veto - proof majority of support for the bill in the @entity25 , @entity137 said , ' it 's his responsibility to count votes , ' then snarked , ' i do n't think anybody 's battin ' 1000 when it comes to countin votes up there			1
' secretary of state @entity17 postponed a foreign trip to meet with members of the @entity25 to discuss the negotiations			0
energy secretary @entity40 , treasury secretary @entity165 and senior officials in the intelligence community were also holding classified briefings monday and tuesday with members of the @entity25 and @entity55			1
@entity137 said some @entity169 are ' rigidly partisan ' and will reject any deal just because president @entity1 supports it			0
and while he acknowledged there is some @entity83 opposition , administration officials will continue to talk with members of his party , he said			2
' i think there are some democrats who will listen to this pitch , ' @entity137 said			0
' i do n't know if it will convince them all , but there is a strong case to make and it 's one that we intend to continue making			0
' on the @entity25 side , majority leader @entity70 said today that he will bring the @entity53 bill to the floor if the @entity55 acts on legislation giving @entity49 the power to review any deal at the @entity25 , @entity1 today met with @entity194 leaders in a separate attempt to woo their support for the shaky deal that appeared last week to be coming apart at the seams as @entity8 leaders indicated that they would n't sign an accord unless it included the immediate lifting of nuclear - related sanctions - something the global community has said it can not and will not agree to			1
@entity205 has since went rogue , saying it would begin allowing missiles told be sold to the country in an oil - for - goods swap			0
secretary @entity17 has spoken to @entity205 foreign minister @entity209 and raised the @entity90 ' concerns , @entity137 told reporters , but declined to provide additional color on their chat			0
@entity215 prime minister @entity214 is intensely skeptical that international negotiators can reach a verifiable deal with @entity8 , which has threatened to destroy @entity215 , while some @entity219 groups have backed the international negotiations			0
@entity1 and national security adviser @entity39 are meeting with leaders of @entity194 organizations such as the @entity223 and the @entity224 , as well as other ' influencers , ' the @entity25			1
put another way , the latter meeting will include major @entity194 donors that will be key to the @entity83 holding the @entity25 beyond january of 2017			2
the administration will attempt to convince them that the deal under discussion is the best way to protect @entity215 's sovereignty			0
@entity8 says its program is for civilian purposes , but the @entity90 and its partners negotiating with @entity62 suspect it is keen to become a nuclear - armed powerhouse in the @entity240 , where it already holds much sway			0
the bill giving @entity49 the power of review has led to a political tug of war on @entity3 , with republicans trying to raise the bar so high that a final deal might be impossible , and @entity83 aiming to give the @entity25 more room to negotiate with @entity62			1
senators of both parties are considering more than 50 amendments to the measure introduced by @entity53 and @entity255 @entity254 of @entity256 .			0

@entity55 panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill that would give @entity49 a say on a nuclear pact with @entity8
@entity25 majority leader @entity70 said today he will bring the bill to the floor if the full @entity55 approves it
administration officials as high up as the president last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers during their spring break
the executive branch wants them to support the pact , and , at the very least , not to meddle in foreign affairs
@entity25 today said administration officials would hold classified briefings with members of @entity49
at the @entity25 , @entity1 today met with @entity194 leaders and donors in a separate attempt to woo their support for the accord
