the stunt , which was posted on @entity16 on november 30 and already has almost 5 million views , begins with @entity6 playing with his son , who is dressed in a @entity20 costume covering his face , on the top floor of their @entity23 , @entity25 home			1
like any other day : a loving mother returns to her home in @entity23 where she finds her husband @entity6 playing with their toddler son who is dressed in a @entity30 costume the switcheroo : @entity6 enlists the help of his elder son who leads the toddler into the other room then hands his dad the small dummy dressed in the same costume as his son the launch : @entity6 pretends to throw his son over the balcony as his wife lets out a shriek and rushes towards what she believes is her fallen son @entity6 and his son are greeted lovingly by the boy â€™s mother , who is then sent downstairs ' to grab them some water ' so that they can prepare the prank behind her back			1
@entity6 enlists the help of his older son who leads his younger brother into the other room them substitutes the toddler for a dummy , which @entity6 then tosses over the railing			2
his wife runs downstairs and screams in paralyzing fear as she sees the boy falling to the ground below and laying motionless on the ground as though he had died			0
she unveils the boy 's mask to reveal a dummy under the costume and then proceeds to shoot a disgusted glance at her husband			0
' why would you do that ? ! ' she screams still trembling in shock			0
' it 's just for fun , ' @entity6 responds as he shrugs his shoulders she then sentences her husband to a lonely night of sleeping on the couch and gives him a little kick in the groin before she storms out of the room			0
petrified : the concerned mother rushes towards the dummy she believes to be her badly injured son unmasked : the mother removes the mask to see the damage done and sees what she thought was her son is nothing more than a dummy horrified : @entity6 's wife tells him that he 'll be sleeping on the couch and gives him a kick to the groin before leaving the room in a huff			1
