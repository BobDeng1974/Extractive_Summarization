there was a new haircut and a new role for @entity3			2
the @entity5 star , who has played in various positions for @entity7 this season , assumed his latest part – as a lone striker			1
here , @entity11 analyses the 20 - year - old ’s performance in the 3 - 1 victory against @entity15			1
@entity3 was used as a lone striker by @entity7 against @entity15 goal threat @entity19 ' decision to utilise the youngster as a centre - forward has raised a few eyebrows			1
surely his talents are best suited to creating rather than scoring goals ? it took @entity3 20 minutes to make a mockery of that claim			2
the way he found space in the area to nod home @entity33 's cross - his first headed goal for the club - was reminiscent of bygone @entity7 no 9 's			1
@entity3 scored his first headed goal for @entity7 on wednesday night the way he took his second of the night echoed that sentiment			1
he had five shots inside the first 70 minutes , more than any other player on the pitch			0
is his long - term future in the position ? probably not			0
but he certainly showed enough to convince doubters that it 's an idea worth experimenting with			0
energy it 's fair to say @entity3 has been overused by @entity7 this season			1
before the @entity15 game he had played 1,364 minutes this season - more than any other outfield @entity7 player			1
the 20 - year - old created havoc with his runs and movement against @entity15 name another 20 - year - old who carries that burden and workload ? you 'd be hard - pushed			2
to be fair , he showed no signs of burnout though , buzzing around the final third looking for pockets of space to create havoc			0
but there will be a time when @entity19 has to take his starlet out of the firing line			0
but given @entity3 's influence , can he afford to ? movement @entity3 , despite his lack of experience in the role , showed a real understanding of what it takes to play as a centre - forward			1
despite his ox - like strength for a man of just 5ft 7ins , holding the ball up is n't going to be one of his main assets			0
@entity3 's pace was a constant threat to the @entity15 defence his pace most definitely it is , though			1
he knows it , too , using it to petrify the @entity15 rearguard last night , playing off the shoulder of the last defender as he looked to stretch the hosts			2
attitude @entity3 's been under the microscope more than usual lately			2
his 17 matches without a goal ahead of wednesday 's @entity99 tie raised more questions			1
@entity3 goes past @entity101 on the way to scoring his second goal he answered those questions emphatically			0
even after his second , there was no let - up from the youngster			0
demanding the ball at every opportunity , making selfless runs to create space for team - mates and defending from the front			0
influence with @entity116 's impact on games far-less obvious nowadays , @entity3 is now @entity7 's ' go to guy '			1
there 's an argument to say that level of pressure is far too great to rest on the shoulders of a man who has only recently left his teens			0
@entity3 is congratulated by team - mates after scoring the first of his two goals that 's how it is , though , he ca n't escape it			1
but on the proof of this display it 's a mantle he is more than happy to take on			0
@entity7 were at their most dangerous when @entity3 was involved , just like @entity116 in his pomp			2
video we showed character to progress - @entity19			0

@entity3 played as a lone striker against @entity15
he scored twice in @entity7 's 3 - 1 victory on wednesday night
@entity7 will now face @entity144 in *semi-final* of @entity99
