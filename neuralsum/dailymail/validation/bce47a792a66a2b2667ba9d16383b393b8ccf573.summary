a different kind of weather by @entity2 at the start of the @entity7 in 1982 , @entity2 , then a junior minister in @entity5 ’s government , was standing in the division lobby of the @entity9 when he saw @entity5 and her entourage of ‘ toadies ’ marching towards him			1
he felt compelled to say something , so , with the @entity15 secretary of state @entity13 at the time trying to broker a @entity17 ‘ sell - out ’ to the @entity18 , he asked : ‘ where do the @entity15 stand , prime minister ? ’ ‘ i do n’t know , @entity2 , ’ came the immediate reply			1
‘ but i know where they are going to stand			0
’ would that @entity27 could deal so unequivocally with the @entity28 , but then none of @entity5 ’s successors have , least of all the pusillanimous @entity24 , whom @entity25 compares with @entity26			1
@entity5 ( right ) is once said to have fought off @entity31 ( left ) with a snarling remark in @entity25 's defence this is surprising , for @entity2 was a passionate @entity35 before transferring his allegiance to @entity5			1
but he is surely right when he asserts that @entity26 ’s great disappointment in life was that the patriotic , liberal @entity42 in which he believed so fervently — ‘ he and it were family ’ — did not return his devotion			1
and in that respect @entity2 is reminded of @entity24 , who ‘ genuinely thought — and thinks — that he created a family called @entity47 which loved him ’			1
in fact it was success that @entity47 loved , not @entity24			0
this absorbing memoir contains some choice gossip as a counter-balance to @entity25 ’s insightful political analysis			2
getting back to @entity26 , he recalls one of the old curmudgeon ’s dinner parties — ‘ not occasions of much merriment ’ — at which @entity61 gamely tried to enliven proceedings with an anecdote about her brother @entity65 , who had just been selected to contest a tough seat in @entity67			1
at a raucous selection meeting , very unlike anything in the @entity70 , the prospective mp had been grasped by the lapels and asked , ‘ are ye married ? ’ around @entity26 ’s table , the diners waited expectantly for the end of an amusing story , but @entity61 suddenly and mystifyingly stopped speaking			1
driving her home later , @entity2 asked if she ’d forgotten the punchline ? ‘ no , ’ she said			1
‘ i was on autopilot and got that far without remembering that after @entity65 admitted to being unmarried , the response was : “ @entity83 , not another @entity42 poofter ! ” ’ she had n’t wanted to offend her illustrious host , whose sexuality was always the subject of speculation — though @entity2 adds that in relation to the @entity92 ’s allegation , it was not ‘ as far as anyone i ever knew could discover , true ’			1
@entity2 ’s own background differs markedly from those of two of his @entity42 heroes , @entity26 and @entity5 , if rather less from that of another , the grouse - shooting enthusiast @entity105 , whom he recalls silencing another dinner party , this time at @entity2 ’s own house , by turning to his neighbour and declaring : ‘ such a pity they abolished the gold sovereign , you know			1
what does one tip one ’s loader ? ’ @entity2 's privileged background was very different to that of his @entity42 hero , @entity5 ( pictured ) the seventh and youngest child of an earl , directly descended from @entity117 , @entity2 is himself the very definition of a toff			1
and he grew up privileged not just socially and materially but also intellectually			1
his parents ’ friends included the philosopher @entity122			0
he was educated at @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
his accent alone opened doors , as he made his way in the world in the @entity130			0
as a scruffy , long - haired student , he once tried to check in for the night at the @entity132 at @entity133 , admitting that he had no money on him but would pay once they sent him the bill			0
the cut - glass vowels , and his explanation that there had once been a locomotive on the great western line named after his family — the @entity143 — secured him the room			0
for those of us who do not come from such lofty beginnings , there is something beguiling yet also appalling about the upper - class milieu @entity2 describes so well			1
after his engagement to @entity154 ended — her father , the political power - broker @entity151 , had made a protégé of him — he found a letter to his own father from a fellow @entity158 , stating : ‘ you must be pleased to see the back of the jewess			2
’ from an early age , @entity2 ’s ambition was to rise to high political office			1
the path ahead looked gilded when he became mp for @entity167 in 1979 , and @entity5 did eventually make him health secretary			1
she liked and rated him , and once fought off a snarling @entity31 on his behalf			0
from an early age , @entity2 's ambition was to rise to high political office , @entity5 ( pictured ) liked him and eventually made him health secretary as @entity17 ’s representative on the @entity174 in 1984 , @entity2 had tried to force @entity175 into taking the dangers of pollution more seriously			1
this enraged @entity179 , who savaged him during a meeting at @entity182 for being a toff , and knowing nothing of the concerns of working folk at @entity175			0
@entity5 listened , and then ‘ began to purr dangerously ’			2
with magnificent condescension , she explained to @entity179 that she was a chemist , and that it was he , not @entity2 , who did not understand these matters			2
bit by bit , she dismantled @entity179 ’s case until he had no argument left			0
‘ i said absolutely nothing , ’ @entity2 writes			2
‘ i just sat there , terrified , while these great animals fought over me			0
‘ as we all filed out , she grasped my elbow , quite hard , and said : “ i always look after my young people , @entity2			2
” ’ but @entity5 ’s patronage was n’t enough			2
gradually it occurred , if at first only to him , that he would never reach the top of the greasy pole			0
he was instinctively a loyalist , and did n’t always back the right horse			0
yet this elegantly - written volume is not really an exercise in score - settling , as so many political memoirs are			0
it is more a reflection on a fascinating life than an account of it , and @entity2 is an astute observer of the political animal , noting that the current mayor of @entity219 has more than a little in common with the late @entity220			1
‘ a subtle and intelligent man , he knew that the @entity17 do not like their politicians to appear too clever , ’ he writes of @entity221			0
‘ his deliberate comical obfuscations predated @entity226 ’s by 30 years , and were a delight			0
’ on the whole , @entity2 wears his social pedigree about as lightly as he can , while exploiting it to shed light , sometimes alarmingly , but also hilariously , on upper - crust ways			2
while holidaying with the @entity232 in @entity233 , he visited rich socialites @entity235 and @entity236 , who ‘ along with their supermodel daughter @entity240 ( who could water - ski on bare feet ) occupied the classical house at @entity243			0
‘ there tull the butler was alleged once to have silenced a boring guest at @entity151 ’s request by means of powdered @entity249 in his bullshot ’			0
many people emerge heroically from @entity2 ’s engrossing reminiscences — not least the great love of his life , his cookery teacher wife @entity255 — but possibly none more so than @entity257 the butler .			2

@entity2 grew up privileged not just socially but intellectually
he was a @entity26 loyalist before transferring to his loyalties to @entity5
from an early age , his ambition was to rise to high political office
@entity5 liked him and eventually made him health secretary
