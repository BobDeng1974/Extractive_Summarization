by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 16:39 est , 6 may 2012 an angry @entity1 today declared war against ' enemies ' who have accused his pay - tv operation of sabotaging its rivals , denouncing them as ' old toffs and right wingers ' stuck in the last century			2
separate reports by the @entity10 and the @entity12 newspaper this week claimed that @entity14 's pay - tv smartcard security unit @entity13 had promoted piracy attacks on its international rivals			1
@entity13 and @entity14 have already denied the allegations			1
but today the media conglomerate mounted a concerted fight back as a corruption scandal that has plagued its @entity22 newspapers began to encroach on its far more lucrative pay - tv business			2
on the offensive : @entity1 today mounted a concerted fight back as a corruption scandal that has plagued his @entity22 newspapers began to encroach on his far more lucrative pay - tv business mr @entity1 , 81 , tweeted : ' seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels			1
so bad , easy to hit back hard , which preparing '			0
his vigorous , and very public , offensive came as @entity36 officials said they are not investigating the report that @entity14 was involved in the piracy - promoting plot aimed at crippling its competitors			1
' if there 's any evidence of that , then the @entity12 should put it to the federal police , but we have not made a reference , the police have not received a reference , ' @entity36 communications minister @entity41 said today , shooting down reports that the government had called for an investigation			1
@entity14 , whose global media interests stretch from movies to newspapers that can make or break political careers , has endured an onslaught of negative press since a phone - hacking scandal at the @entity61 blew up last year			1
at its height last july , @entity1 told mps : ' this is the humblest day of my life ' , after meeting the family of murdered schoolgirl @entity67 whose phone @entity61 journalists had hacked			0
but it today appeared that @entity1 has had enough of apologising			0
he tweeted : ' enemies many different agendas , but worst old toffs and right wingers who still want last century 's status quo with their monopolies			0
' for an avowed republican such as @entity1 , describing someone as a rich and upper - class ' toff ' is a damning insult			2
opinionated : @entity1 often takes to @entity84 to give his thoughts for the day accused : @entity86 ( right ) , the former editor of @entity87 and @entity61 , has been on bail since last summer when she was arrested on suspicion of phone - hacking and corruption the @entity10 has a long history of ideological clashes with @entity93 , which is 39 per cent owned by @entity14 , and both @entity1 and his son @entity94 have publicly attacked the corporation over the years			1
the @entity12 is owned by @entity96 , the main rival to @entity1 's @entity98 newspaper group in @entity36			1
@entity94 sits on the board of @entity13 , which @entity14 and co-owner private equity firm @entity100 agreed to sell for $ 5billion to @entity101 this month			1
he is also non-executive chairman and former ceo of @entity93			0
the younger @entity1 has been criticised for not uncovering the scale of phone - hacking at the @entity61 , though he had not yet joined the newspaper operation when the hacking took place			2
he has since moved to @entity108 after being promoted within @entity14 to deputy chief operating officer , and has severed all ties with the @entity22 newspapers			1
his focus is now the company 's international pay - tv operations , where he made his career			2
@entity117 , @entity14 's coo and @entity94 's immediate boss , issued a statement last night in which he condemned both the @entity121 documentary and other media worldwide who had reported its claims			1
he said : ' the @entity10 's @entity121 program was a gross misrepresentation of @entity13 's role as a high quality and leading provider of technology and services to the pay - tv industry , as are many of the other press accounts that have piled on - if not exaggerated - the @entity10 's inaccurate claims '			2
@entity13 has complained that it was not asked for its side of the story before monday 's @entity121 , which claimed @entity13 had leaked secret codes that allowed rampant pirating of @entity93 rival @entity140 , which went bust in 2002			0
separate reports by the @entity10 and the @entity12 newspaper this week claimed that @entity14 's pay - tv smartcard security unit @entity13 had promoted piracy attacks on its international rivals on thursday , @entity13 's executive chairman @entity148 published a detailed letter to @entity121 accusing the documentary of using manipulated emails to support its allegations , and demanding that the program retract the claims			1
the @entity10 said : ' we stand by the @entity121 investigation			0
we have received @entity13 's correspondence and are aware of @entity14 's rejection of @entity121 's revelations			1
' however , the emails shown in the program were not manipulated , as @entity13 claims , and nothing in the correspondence undermines the evidence presented in the program			0
' also this week , the @entity12 published a story claiming that @entity13 had allowed piracy to thrive at its client @entity170 satellite broadcaster @entity172 , which @entity1 had ambitions to buy , even though it had a fix			0
it reported that @entity13 ran a secret unit in the mid- 1990s to sabotage its competitors			0
the stories were the result of a four - year investigation by investigative reporter @entity180 , who has written two books about @entity1			0
@entity182 , the @entity12 's editor - in - chief , said today : ' we fully stand by our reports in the paper and by @entity180 's extraordinary investigation			0
' we are not motivated in any way by any desire to damage any financial rival to the company that runs the @entity12			0
we are simply following the story and publishing what we have uncovered			0
' none of the evidence presented by @entity121 and the @entity12 this week suggests that the @entity195 or any other @entity14 executives were aware at the alleged practices at @entity13			2
@entity13 has won several court cases brought by rivals accusing it of promoting piracy , while others have been dropped - in one case because @entity14 bought a subsidiary from the rival , @entity204 , which at the time was struggling with debt			1
@entity14 made $ 3.8billion in revenues and $ 232million in operating profit from satellite tv in its last fiscal year			2
it does not detail financial results for its newspapers but its @entity22 titles bring in less than 3 per cent of group profit .			0

@entity14 boss , 81 , takes to @entity84 to launch *savage* attack on his critics
@entity36 officials confirm they are not investigating report that @entity14 was involved in the piracy - promoting plot aimed at crippling its competitors
