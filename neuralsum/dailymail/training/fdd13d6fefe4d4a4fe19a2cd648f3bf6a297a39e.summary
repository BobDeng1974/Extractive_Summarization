by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 00:09 est , 24 march 2012 in hindsight , it probably was n’t worth it for a milkshake			1
when a brazen shoplifter skulked into a post office in @entity8 , he assumed it would be easy to pocket a couple of drinks			1
but behind the counter was @entity13 , sub-postmaster ... and former @entity16 champion			1
mr @entity17 , who has a second degree black - belt in the @entity20 combat style , has now become an internet hit after posting @entity23 footage of himself wrestling with the thief on @entity25			1
no nonsense : shopkeeper and martial arts expert @entity17 tackled a shoplifter in his store in @entity8 in the clip the 30 - year - old shopkeeper is seen taking down the teen after he tried to leave the shop with two milkshakes worth £ 2.30			1
mr @entity17 ’s 51 - year - old father , @entity35 , can also be seen joining the fray in the @entity37 , which houses @entity38			1
the shopkeeper has now been hailed the internet ’s next ‘ @entity43 ’ , with his clip already having gained 1,500 hits since the incident on monday			1
the famous ‘ @entity43 ’ @entity25 hit , which racked up two million views , sparked massive debate after banker @entity47 was seen throwing @entity48 off a train , taking matters into his own hands after the student allegedly refused to pay his fare			1
mr @entity17 said he hoped his film would prove a deterrent to shoplifters visiting the store			2
paid the price : the shoplifter hides under the hood of his green jacket as he swipes two milkshakes from the shelf the shopkeeper and his family have been in business for 21 years and he claims the thief had been barred after he was spotted stealing ‘ three or four times ’			1
mr @entity17 added : ‘ he came back and stole two more shakes			2
i approached him as he went for the door and he took a swing at me			2
‘ i ’m a second degree black - belt in @entity16 , so i know how to control that kind of situation and do it without hurting someone			2
i grabbed him and threw him down			2
’ in january last year , mr @entity17 was held up at gunpoint by 18 - year - old @entity77 , who threatened ‘ i ’ll blow your brains out ’			0
the gun was later revealed to be replica rifle and @entity77 was jailed for five years and four months			0
mr @entity17 has been more cautious since the ordeal , and so when the shoplifter struck on saturday , he was ready to stamp out any potential threat			0
he said : ‘ he was shouting and swearing and then he started going for his pockets			0
i did n’t know if he was going to pull a needle or a knife and , after what happened last year , i did n’t want to take a chance			0
’ hold it : mr @entity17 intercepts the thief as he makes for the door taken down : after a brief scuffle mr @entity17 , dressed in black , seizes the shoplifter by the lapel and hurls him to the floor mr @entity17 said he deals with around three shoplifters a week , most of whom surrender without incident			1
he added : ‘ the police said i should ’ve let him leave the store first , but @entity107 law is on my side as he went past the counter and touched the door			0
‘ it was my friend who suggested i put the cctv on @entity25 , but i had no idea it would get so many hits			0
’ however , one rival shopkeeper , who asked not to be named , criticised mr @entity17 , saying : ‘ this was clearly unreasonable force			0
it was totally disgusting and unacceptable			0
the shopkeeper should be charged with assault			0
’ a @entity123 spokeswoman said : ‘ a 17 - year - old boy has been charged in connection with this incident and is due to appear at court at a later date			0

the teenage thief tried to run off with two milkshakes worth just £ 2.30
he had already been barred from the @entity8 shop for stealing
