when @entity2 was born in 1977 , her future husband @entity0 was already 33 years old			1
the couple both went through a marriage and had children with their previous spouses before finally falling in love seven years ago			2
the age gap and timing of their union rocked the religious community they were part of so strongly that they were forced to leave their local church , where @entity0 was volunteering as a pastor , and join a different congregation			1
but almost decade later and the @entity19 couple are stronger than ever , with two children of their own , @entity22 , four and @entity23 , six			2
they also live with @entity2 's two children from her first marriage , @entity27 , ten , and @entity28 , 12			1
make and @entity2 started dating when she was 30 and he was was 63			2
seven years later they are married with two children			0
the first few years of their romance were not such plain sailing though			0
after meeting through the local church , @entity2 and @entity0 remained just friends for several years while she was married to her first husband			1
but as her first relationship crumbled , @entity2 turned to @entity0 for advice and assistance in leaving her partner			1
she said : ' my husband had gone out with the children , something had happened and i just thought to myself that i 'd had enough			0
' i rang @entity0 and asked if he could find me somewhere to stay			2
' he picked me up , rang round his friends and found me somewhere			0
' he took a week off work and helped out and just generally was was fantastic			0
' and before long , @entity0 's chivalrous behaviour meant @entity2 started to see him as more than just a friend			1
she said : ' i was n't looking for love and so was very surprised when i found i had feelings for @entity0			2
' but i had never been treated so well , so respected , for someone treat me so well without expecting anything back			0
' @entity0 , who had been single for fifteen years after splitting from his first wife , admits that he was already holding a torch for @entity2 by this time and could n't believe it when his feelings started to be reciprocated			1
he told this morning : ' she was a friend in crisis , but there was also an attraction - i 'd always fancied her a bit - for several years before we got together ' i was of course i was surprised ( when she liked me ) , because well , look at me			0
' i always say i look like an oil painting , something like @entity66			0
' @entity2 and @entity67 have a 33 year age gap , but they are happily married in a romance that has lasted seven years the couple did n't have long to adjust to their new relationship - just six weeks after they started dating , @entity2 fell pregnant			1
she said : ' my first husband and i had struggled to conceive with my eldest two children and with ( @entity0 ) being so old , we just decided to take a chance			2
' seven years later , the couple are married with two children of their own , along with two children from @entity2 's previous marriage and five children from @entity0 's earlier relationship			1
@entity0 has taken on the role of house husband , while @entity2 is studying for a degree in nursing			1
he said : ' it 's great , i 'm a house husband and i do school runs , get up in the night with the kids , sort out meals and do most of all that side of things because i have more time			0
' it 's a bit like being a full - time dad , but also with the role you 'd expect the wife to have			0
' @entity0 and @entity2 first met int heir local church , where he was a volunteer pastor and she was the organist and his elder children are equally comfortable with the age gap in his second marriage			1
when asked what his family first made of the match , he said : ' one of my lads asked if she has a friend ! ' the only negative of their budding romance was that @entity2 and @entity0 were both forced to leave their local church after a backlash from fellow members of the congregation			1
@entity2 said : ' initially it was very difficult , but looking back i can understand why they did what they did			0
' because i was still legally married , they saw it as adultery , even though i had left my first husband before anything happened with @entity0			0
' but i can see why they did what they did			0
i do n't hold any hard feelings			0
' @entity0 added : ' the problem was also that her ex-husband obviously needed some support and if had we stayed in that congregation , then he would n't have got the support that he needed , so we found another one			0
' @entity2 fell for @entity0 because of his chivalrous behaviour but now the dust has long settled and the couple are looking forward to sharing the rest of their lives together			1
and both @entity2 and @entity0 believe that the age difference gives them just as good chance of survival as a couple who are the same age			1
@entity0 said : ' with marriages today , you see the ones who break up - they 're often the same age			2
' so it must be compatibility , not age and about whether you can keep the love going			0
' @entity0 and @entity2 star in a documentary called @entity167 on @entity168 at 9pm tonight .			1

@entity0 and @entity2 met at their local church where @entity0 was a pastor
they believe compatibility is more *important* than age for staying together
the couple now have two children
