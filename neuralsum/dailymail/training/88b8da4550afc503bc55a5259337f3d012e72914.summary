by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 9 august 2013 an ice cream seller has been warned he could be evicted for serving cones with a flake - because it breaches the terms of his lease			1
@entity8 , 23 , has operated milkshake bar @entity9 on @entity12 promenade in @entity13 for three years			1
but he has become embroiled in a battle with @entity15 over the ice creams he has also been selling to customers			0
fuming : milkshake bar owner @entity8 says he can not understand why he is n't allowed to sell ice creams with a flake licensing bosses say out of fairness to other outlets on the seafront , he should not be selling traditional ' 99 ' ice cream cones with a flake			1
mr @entity8 was sent a letter informing him a customer had been spotted eating one sold from his shop and that this was a violation of the terms of his lease			1
he was warned to cease selling such ice creams or face enforcement action including the forfeiture of his lease			0
mr @entity8 said : ' it just seems like one big joke to me and i ’ll fight it all the way			1
apparently in my lease it says i can sell ice cream but i ca n’t sell it with any additives , such as flakes , sauce or sprinkles			2
' the crazy thing is i can sell them separately but not together			0
if i do sell them together i have been told enforcement action will be taken			0
' dispute : council bosses say it is not fair on other seafront outlets if mr @entity8 also serves ice creams with a flake he added : ' when people buy an ice cream the majority of them want a flake to go with it - if i had to tell them " sorry , i can sell you the ice cream but not with a flake " , i would lose about 80 per cent of my business			1
' i got a letter from the council which said i was spotted selling an ice cream which had a flake and red sauce on it			2
it says it will be looked into and enforcement action , which could include the forfeiture of my lease , could be taken			0
' @entity79 mayor @entity78 has hit out at the ban , saying : ' it is ludicrous you can sell an ice cream and not a flake to go with it			2
' a spokesman for @entity15 said : ' we like to have a balance of concessions along @entity12 seafront and mr @entity8 freely entered into a lease with the council last year to operate his milkshake concession			1
' he personally negotiated and agreed the terms of the lease			0
the council has not varied the terms of his lease since it was agreed			0
the council has been in lengthy discussions with mr @entity8 on a variety of other lease issues over many months			2
' as he has very recently demonstrated an apparent willingness to work within the terms of his agreement , the council has agreed to a minor variation to what he can sell from his concession as long as he complies fully with the terms of his lease			0
' the spokesman added that the lease allowed mr @entity8 to sell soft vanilla ice cream , but not put any signs up to advertise this out of fairness to other existing concessionaires .			1

@entity8 , 23 , sells ' 99 ' cones from milkshake bar on @entity12 seafront
@entity15 says lease is only for soft ice cream - not with flakes
sent mr @entity8 a warning after customer spotted eating traditional ' 99 ' cone
' it seems like one big joke to me - i *'ll* fight it all the way , ' he said
