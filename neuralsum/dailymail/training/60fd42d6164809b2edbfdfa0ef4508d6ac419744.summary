an air force veteran who had to leave active duty after being blown up twice in roadside bomb attacks now captures the portraits of other veterans as a form of ' therapy '			1
@entity7 , a retired @entity8 staff sergeant , suffered a devastating neck injury after being involved in @entity11 attacks in @entity12 in february 2004 and march 2007			1
recurring neck pain forced her to leave active duty , and she risked falling into depression			1
unforgettable : @entity7 , a retired @entity17 @entity8 sergeant who was forced out of active duty after being involved in two bomb attacks in @entity12 , now takes portrait photographs of fellow veterans , like the shirtless solider seen above staring at his uniform in all his glory : an officer stands in shadow dressed in his full military uniform ' therapy ' : mrs @entity7 said taking pictures of other veterans was a therapeutic activity for her she said : ' when i left the military it was not on my terms and it was a very dark period			1
' military service was my life			2
when it got taken away from me it was like having the wind taken out of my sails			1
' however , mrs @entity7 , 34 , was able to stay connected to the military through her love of photography and began meeting and photographing veterans from the @entity48 to the present			1
since august 2008 she has photographed more than 100 veterans of various conflicts for a series she has named ' @entity53 '			1
she said : ' i turned to portrait photography			0
i never anticipated it to be therapy but it was			2
' mrs @entity7 was just two weeks away from returning home after a tour of duty in @entity60 when she was involved in the first bomb attack			1
family bond : a veteran smiles as his daughter plans a kiss on his cheek as he balances her on his knee paying the cost : a veteran with a prosthetic leg stands proud and similes broadly for the camera injured but not defeated : a disabled veteran looks lost in thought as he sits in his wheelchair playing around : a former pilot gestures with a model airplane while resting on a chair ; mrs @entity7 said soldiers often opened up to her about their wartime experiences while having their pictures taken good on ya : a veteran winks at the photographer as he has a close - up picture taken of his face she said : ' i walked away from the explosion and did n't realise how badly i was injured			1
i did n't know it at the time , but when i was hit i seriously injured my neck and sustained brain trauma			2
' having returned home , she was cooking dinner when she realised just how seriously she had been hurt			0
she said : ' the world flipped upside down			0
i fell to the floor , and had no idea what was going on			0
' despite being diagnosed with vertigo , she was still deemed fit enough to return to @entity12 in 2007 where she again had a narrow escape			0
after being involved in the second incident , mrs @entity7 was forced to retire in 2008			1
in august that year her medical care was transferred to a @entity107 where she began meeting other veterans and exchanging stories			2
at first , veterans thought she must have been there to visit a relative			2
what a character : a veteran with a walking frame , wore sunglasses and a cap to have his picture taken proud : an injured soldier , quietly poses for his picture ; mrs @entity7 approached organisations , including @entity121 , the @entity122 , the @entity123 and the @entity124 to fund her portrait project way back when : a veteran holds a small photo of him taking during his time in the service next generation : a female solider poses for her portrait as her daughter hides under her chair she said : ' i got to know a @entity48 veteran			1
he leaned over and asked if i was there to support my grandfather			0
he was surprised when i told him i was actually the veteran			0
we soon began trading stories			0
' this encounter made me realise a lot of people have a specific idea of what a veteran should look like - but despite the physical differences between me and him we shared many of the same experiences			0
' mrs @entity7 then approached organisations , including @entity121 , the @entity122 , the @entity123 and the @entity124 to fund her portrait project			2
mrs @entity7 , of @entity154 , @entity155 , said while having their picture taken , veterans often opened - up about their experiences			1
she recalled : ' a @entity161 veteran once came in for a portrait and told me his job was to identify bodies which were mutilated beyond recognition			0
@entity48 creates horror beyond comprehension			0
' i had n't noticed at the time but as he told me this his wife was in the corner of the room , crying			0
afterwards she hugged me and told me she had lived with him for decades but had never been told about his experiences in the war			0
' why he chose to talk about it at that specific point in time i will never know			0
' mrs @entity7 continues to travel around @entity17 , photographing her fellow veterans .			1

@entity7 was a sergeant in the @entity8 when she was injured

taking pictures of other veterans became a form of ' therapy '
