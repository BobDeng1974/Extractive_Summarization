or at least that 's what @entity8 thought she saw , when a sinister face appeared from the undergrowth , close to the legendary birthplace of @entity13 in @entity14			1
but the dog walker from @entity16 , @entity17 , heaved a sigh of relief when she realised it was just the remains of a moss - covered tree stump , albeit one with a menacing ' face ' and ' wing '			1
@entity25 monster : @entity8 spotted the tree stump peering out of undergrowth close to @entity1 , @entity14 describing it as a cross between @entity31 's nemesis @entity30 and a flying monkey from @entity33 , the alarmed holidaymaker said : ' when i first saw the tree stump i did a double take , as it gave me such a shock			1
' its ugly , angry face reminded me exactly of the gargoyles you see on top of old buildings in gothic films			0
' i love nature and also architecture , so i am always looking at the world around me , including the shapes and colours of plants and trees , as well as the designs on the exteriors of buildings			0
' but i certainly did n't expect to see something like this ! ' popular with tourists , @entity1 stands upon a dramatic setting on the north @entity14 coast and has been linked to the legends of @entity13 since the 12th century			1
strange resemblance : the ' face ' on the stump has been likened to @entity30 and an evil flying monkey from the @entity33 @entity1 is a medieval fortification located on the peninsula of @entity67 , close to the village of @entity69 in @entity14 , @entity70			1

in the @entity78 , a fictional account of @entity76 history written by @entity77 , @entity69 is described as the place where @entity13 was conceived			2
according to the tale , @entity13 's father , @entity80 , was disguised by @entity83 's sorcery to look like @entity84 , @entity85 and the husband of @entity87 , @entity13 's mother			2

legendary : @entity1 in @entity14 has strong links with the legend of @entity13 in his @entity100 , lord @entity99 also refers to the links between @entity69 and @entity13			1
despite these literary connections , no archaeologist has been able to find proof at the site that @entity13 existed or that the castle was linked to the legendary king			2
the archaeologist @entity109 @entity108 declared in 1935 that : ' no evidence whatsoever has been found to support the legendary connection of the @entity1 with @entity13 '			1
many historians believe @entity13 was a completely mythical character , but others disagree , saying he may be based upon a @entity76 leader in the fifth century			0
