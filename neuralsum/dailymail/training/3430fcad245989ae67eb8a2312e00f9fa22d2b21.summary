claims : @entity9 , 77 , pictured with his wife @entity17 who believes ' brutish ' police treatment of her husband at a care home led to his death two months later yesterday his devastated family said they were ' 100 per cent sure ' the incident with police had ultimately led to his death			1
mrs @entity36 , a retired nurse who was married to mr @entity9 for 55 years , said : ' after he was handcuffed his condition really deteriorated			2

' it was awful to watch , our family felt helpless as we just watched him slip away			0
he just have up after that incident with police			0
' because he stopped eating , he went from 12 stone to just six stone , he lost all that weight in about a month			1
incident : mr @entity9 had been at @entity51 care home in @entity14 , @entity15 , for just a few hours when staff called police because he was ' lashing out ' at other patients ' my husband was a caring and kind man and extremely popular , there were over 300 people at his funeral earlier this month and he will be sorely missed by everyone			1
' the pensioner had checked in at @entity51 after his wife took a trip to @entity64 to get some much needed rest from caring for her husband			0
but within just hours of his arrival , the couple ’s son @entity67 , 40 , was called to say his father was upsetting some residents			0
mrs @entity36 believes this was because dementia sufferers have a tendency to ' lash out ' and the home should have been able to deal with it as they are medically trained			0

' officers came round and @entity9 was still agitated , they brutally restrained him by handcuffing him causing cuts on his wrists - they were way too heavy - handed			2
' it was awful , it is a horrible thing to hear about the person you love			0
' it is hard for me to imagine the pain he went through on that day , you do n’t handcuff a 77 - year - old man , it just is n’t right , although the police said they were in their rights to do so			2
' there was no need for them to do what they did , it was too much for him , he was clearly confused being in new surroundings and needed to be cared for properly			0
' people should know about dementia , it is common nowadays and people should know how to deal with it , not handcuff pensioners			0
' i dropped my husband at that place so i could get some rest and they could care for him for a week			0
' i was n’t going to go away for years and years , just a week ’s holiday			0
