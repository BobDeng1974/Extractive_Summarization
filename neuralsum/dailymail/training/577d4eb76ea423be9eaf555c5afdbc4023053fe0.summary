the new initiative has been condemned as ' boneheaded meddling ' which could add to the financial woes of already hard - pressed families families should even sell their car to end the ' bad habit ' of using it for trips of less than a mile and walk instead ‘ @entity25 ’s boneheaded attempts to interfere demonstrate how out of touch they are with the pressures faced by hard - pressed families			1
