@entity1 's affiliate in @entity2 is facing mounting pressure from its members to form an ultra-alliance with the @entity6 to confront a common enemy after @entity9 - led air strikes hit both groups this week			1
@entity11 , long one of the most effective forces fighting @entity2 president @entity13 , was weakened this year by battles with @entity15 , an @entity1 splinter group that routinely employs ruthless methods such as beheadings and mass executions			1
@entity9 - led air and missile strikes , which have hit @entity11 as well as @entity15 bases in @entity2 , have angered many @entity11 members who say the @entity24 and its allies have joined forces in a ' crusader ' campaign against @entity29			1
the two share the same ideology and rigid @entity29 beliefs , but fell out during a power struggle that pitted @entity15 head @entity34 against @entity1 chief @entity35 and @entity11 leader @entity11			1
but merging would require pledging loyalty to @entity15 , which has declared a caliphate in territory it controls in @entity42 and @entity2 , which would effectively put an end to the @entity11 , fighters in the group say			1
rising up : supporters of the @entity11 protest in @entity46 against @entity2 president @entity13 and the @entity9 - led international coalition after the rebel group was hit by air strikes this week members of the @entity11 ( above ) want their leaders to reconcile with its rival @entity15 to confront a common enemy , namely president @entity13 and @entity56 forces launching bombing raids in @entity2 and @entity42 sources close to @entity15 said some @entity11 fighters were joining them after the strikes and there was a growing sense among many that it was time to put their differences aside			1
' there are hardline voices inside @entity11 who are pushing for reconciliation with @entity15 , ' a source close to @entity11 's leadership told @entity72 , though he doubted it would happen			2
he would never reconcile with @entity15			0
if he ever does it , it would be in a direct order from the leadership , and that is @entity35 himself			0
' however , one @entity15 fighter said he believed there was an ' 80 per cent chance that the brothers of @entity11 will join the @entity6 '			2
the @entity86 , a @entity87 - based monitoring group , said on friday over 200 fighters had joined @entity15 in the northern @entity46 area , many from the @entity11 , since @entity9 president @entity91 said he was prepared to strike the group in @entity2			1
sources close to @entity15 ( above ) said some @entity11 fighters were joining them after the @entity9 - led strikes the two groups share the same ideology , but fell out during a power struggle that pitted @entity99 head @entity34 ( above ) against @entity1 chief @entity35 and @entity11 leader @entity11 even before the air strikes , @entity11 was facing difficulties and was losing fighters to the @entity15 , which is seen as more organised and determined to impose @entity29 rule			1
' this goes without saying , this is a crusader war that includes all infidel nations against the @entity15 , ' said @entity11 commander @entity109 in a voice message posted in jihadi forums online in response to a question from an @entity114 about the group 's reaction to the strikes			1
' regardless of what happened between us , they remain our brothers , and the ideological bond between us is stronger than anything			0
we are ready to fight by their side ... our blood is their blood			0
' one former @entity11 fighter inside @entity2 said the air strikes had strengthened @entity15 's position even further			1
' @entity11 is in a very difficult situation			2
i think now it should just announce the end of itself			0
@entity35 has to be brave , ' he told @entity72			0
' it is no longer like the old days			0
he needs to understand this			0
this is a new era with a caliph , ' he said			0
yet sources from and close to both sides said it would be difficult for the two groups to work together without merging - and with @entity11 in a weaker position , that would effectively mean being subsumed by @entity15			1
such a decision should be taken by @entity35 himself			0
sources say he should give a speech outlining @entity1 's position on the attacks soon			1
structure : @entity34 employs a network of deputies , councils and executives with the power to act on the @entity99 leader 's behalf			1
these senior militants are believed to give orders to a group of 24 regional governors , who in turn head ' councils ' managing everything from the sale of oil , to the treatment of prisoners ' @entity75 does not trust @entity172 , and he does n't like his politics and agenda , he sees it as distorted and astray , ' the source close to the @entity11 leadership said			2
but there were figures inside @entity177 who were seen as more extreme that wanted to make peace with @entity15 , he said , naming top @entity11 cleric @entity181 , who is also close to @entity75 , as a particularly strong proponent of reconciliation			2
if that does happen , it would be an alliance and not a merger , the source said , adding merger would be impossible since @entity34 , who has declared himself leader of all the world 's @entity191 , would want @entity35 to pledge allegiance to him			0
but even if @entity35 only orders @entity11 to fight alongside @entity15 , it is likely to accelerate any haemorrhaging of influence from him to @entity172			2
@entity11 , which has been trying with allies to remove its name from the @entity202 terrorist list , was taken by surprise when @entity9 - led coalition warplanes bombed several of its positions in @entity208 province			1
several commanders are believed to have been killed in the strikes , including @entity212 - born @entity211 - also known as @entity213 - reputedly a former member of @entity216 's inner circle , and whom @entity218 officials call the head of the ' @entity221 '			2
@entity222 is the @entity29 term for an area including parts of @entity226 and @entity227 , where @entity1 's main council is believed to be in hiding			2
the source close to the @entity11 leadership said the @entity222 group was led by veterans from @entity227			1
' it is a very small group - dozens of fighters only			0
it is more symbolic because it is composed of veterans who came from @entity227 , and they are all wanted by @entity237			0
they directly follow the @entity1 leadership , ' he said			2
another @entity11 source said @entity211 and @entity75 had fallen out recently but had continued to cooperate			2
the strikes on the ' @entity221 ' also showed that the @entity9 knew more than it should , he said			1
this could embarrass @entity11 leaders by leading fighters to suspect they were infiltrated			1
@entity11 leaders have reportedly gone underground and changed locations since the strikes			1
' the precision of the raids on these positions shows clearly that the @entity9 have intelligence members among the @entity177 fighters			1
it is very clear to us now , ' the @entity11 source said			0
@entity15 fighters and sympathisers have vowed to respond to the strikes			0
in particular they accused @entity259 of being the mastermind behind the attacks			0
but jihadis also say the group is in no hurry and is waiting to see what the coalition plans to do			0
the group 's leaders went underground even before the strikes , it has evacuated most of its buildings in its stronghold of @entity273 province , and its fighters are rarely seen on the streets			0
' the response will be in every country that took part in bombing @entity191 and their state , ' said an @entity15 fighter in @entity2			0
in our eyes , it fell a long time ago , but now @entity191 across the world saw it			0

@entity1 affiliate in @entity2 under pressure from members to merge with @entity99
demand for alliance comes after both groups were hit by @entity9 - led air strikes
but sources say it may not work without weaker @entity11 merging with @entity99
groups share ideology but split during power struggle between 3 leaders
