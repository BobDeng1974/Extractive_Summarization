@entity1 's @entity0 casts his eye over the weekend 's controversial moments in the @entity4 to assess whether the match officials made the correct call			0
@entity8 v @entity7 if @entity10 was taller he would have head - butted @entity11 in the face			1
instead he got as close as he could , after being incensed for no clear reason , but still should have been dismissed for his petulant act in the clear view of referee @entity16			0
the usually excellent @entity16 chose to leave @entity10 on which was hard to understand given his clear view of the offence			0
@entity8 's @entity10 was fortunate to escape a red card for this confrontation with @entity11 the @entity22 is held back by @entity23 as @entity10 squares up to him @entity24 v @entity25 if @entity26 was upset when @entity27 accused him of being a cheat when @entity29 played @entity24 last month it has n't affected his conduct			1
@entity26 was certainly guilty of a dive in this match when he went over for a penalty which referee @entity34 was well positioned to turn down			2
the only mystery was why the @entity37 - based referee failed to stop play and caution @entity26 as he should have done			0
until referees step up and carry out their duties properly , players will continue to dive and cheat			0
@entity26 was guilty of a dive in @entity24 's match with @entity25 but @entity34 did n't book him @entity47 v @entity46 @entity47 are the best team in the @entity4 by quite some distance this season and certainly do n’t need to be helped by poor officiating			1
@entity51 was let down badly by his assistant who somehow failed to see that @entity53 was in an offside position when he scored the @entity56 ' opening goal			2
however , @entity46 can have no complaints about @entity51 when he rightly dismissed @entity58 for a two - footed jumping tackle on @entity53 – that type of challenge needs to be stamped out of football			1
@entity53 scored @entity47 's opening goal from an offside position in their win over @entity46 @entity58 saw red for this reckless two - footed lunge on @entity53 @entity58 protests his innocence to referee @entity51 after being dismissed red card ? red face ! referee @entity71 was left red faced when he decided to send @entity73 ’s @entity72 off at @entity74 on friday evening			1
as he searched his pockets he realised he did not have a red card with him and had to borrow one from his assistant referee !			0

@entity10 should have been sent off for ' petulant ' *reaction* to @entity11 in @entity8 vs @entity7 clash
@entity26 dived in @entity24 's match with @entity25 but received no *yellow* card from referee @entity34
@entity53 scored for @entity47 from an offside position vs @entity46
@entity58 's two - footed lunge on @entity53 was awful
