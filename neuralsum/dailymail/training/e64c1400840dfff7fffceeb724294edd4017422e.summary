no , @entity0 did n't reveal himself to this @entity2 man in a vision			0
but it seems @entity5 has been reading about the @entity7 prophecy that predicts the end of the world on december 21			1
he is so afraid of the rumours he has spent his whole life savings trying to build his very own apocalypse - proof ' @entity14 '			1
race for survival : one @entity2 man is so convinced the world will end next month he is building his very own @entity14 ( pictured ) the vessel , which has cost him ¥ 1million ( £ 100,000 ) , measures 21.2m long , 15.5m wide , 5.6m high and displaces about 140 tons of water			1
@entity5 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , admits it 's not much to look at , but is confident it will serve its purpose			1
scientists and researchers are going out of their way to assure people that december 21 , 2012 , the so - called @entity7 end - date , will not bring about @entity31			1
but that has n't stopped some from ploughing on with their own safety measures regardless			0
faith : @entity5 has spent his whole life savings of £ 100,000 on the boat , which he believes will save him from an impending global disaster not quite biblical proportions : the vessel measures 21.2m long , 15.5m wide , 5.6m high and displaces about 140 tons of water work in progress : @entity5 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , admits it 's not much to look at , but is confident it will serve its purpose in @entity47 , the authorities have been forced to ban access to a sacred mountain , rumoured to be a haven from the apocalypse , because hordes of believers have been flocking to the region in recent weeks			1
legend has it that the @entity57 in south - west @entity47 will burst open on that day revealing an alien spaceship which will carry nearby humans to safety			2
a hundred police and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the same name at the foot of the mountain , and if too many people turn up , they will block access there , too			0
doomsday refuge : the @entity57 , south - west @entity47 , where some believe an alien spacecraft will burst out taking humans away from an apocalypse expectations : with the @entity74 , pictured , ending on or around december 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world the significance of december 21 , 2012 , stems from interpretations of the @entity83 calendar , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns			1
experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 @entity88 and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around that day			0
however , experts say that while 13 was a significant number for the @entity7 , the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but not an end			2
@entity95 , an anthropologist at the @entity96 , said : ' the maya long count system is like a car odometer			0
' my first car ( odometer ) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles			0
' that did n't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles			2
' as the clock winds down to december 21 , experts on the maya calendar have been racing to convince people that the @entity7 did n't predict an apocalypse for the end of this year			2
some experts are now saying the @entity7 may indeed have made prophecies , just not about the @entity31			0
archaeologists , anthropologists and other experts met in september in the southern @entity116 of @entity117 to discuss the implications of the @entity83 calendar , which some interpret as signalling the end of the world on december 21			1
meanwhile , only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at @entity127 and neither refers to an apocalypse , experts say			2
such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in @entity132 , @entity131 thinking , and are not native to @entity7 thought			0
experts stressed that the ancient @entity7 , whose ' classic ' culture of writing , astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year @entity138 to 900ad , were extremely interested in future events , far beyond december 21 .			0
