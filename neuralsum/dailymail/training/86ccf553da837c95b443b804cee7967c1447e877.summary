by @entity0 think of origami and you may imagine delicate paper cranes or fortune tellers			0
but the art of folding paper to create 3d shapes has been used to make a flexible robot			2
roboticists have shown off two designs of origami - inspired wheel systems that allow a robot to shape - shift and climb a flight of steps using their intricate but strong wheels			1
the wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over things , and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles			1
each wheel features a single actuator , and sensors that detect changes in terrain			0
the transmission is continuously variable and automatic , which means the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they can rotate smoothly			2
researchers from @entity48 , @entity49 , have designed a robotic wheel based on the ‘ magic ball pattern , ’ which is a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres			1
the wheel can change its radius to create larger wheels to climb over things , and shrink back to a smaller size to squeeze under obstacles , @entity52 reported from its @entity57			2
the wheel 's lead creator , professor @entity58 explained that his design can shrink to have a radius of two inches ( 5.5cm ) , and expand to have a bigger footprint of four inches ( 12cm ) , using just one actuator per wheel			0
there are also sensors placed on the outside of each wheel to detect changes in terrain			0
scientists at @entity70 teamed up with the group in @entity72 to enable the origami wheels to expand and shrink automatically			1
scientists at @entity70 teamed up with the group in @entity72 to design origami wheels that automatically expand ( pictured a and b ) and shrink ( pictured c and d ) to enable the robot to be both fast and strong			1
an earlier design is pictured they wanted to use the design to act as an automatic variable transition - a gearbox that changes seamlessly through an infinite number of effective gear ratios to alter a machine 's speed and torque , or force			0
the point of this was to design a robot that can be speedy as well as strong , in comparison to most robots with fixed - size wheels and gears that can either be fast , or powerful , but not both			1
the origami wheel can do both because it expands and shrinks in size			0
it ' decides ' how large it should be for the task automatically			0
this system allows the small robot to zip along swiftly or to clamber over obstacles or to haul objects along			0
the robot ’s creator , professor @entity58 explained that the wheels ( pictured ) can shrink to have a radius of two inches ( 5.5cm ) and expand to have a bigger footprint of four inches ( 12cm ) magic ? researchers from @entity48 have designed a robotic wheel ( pictured ) based on the ' magic ball pattern , ' which is a traditional technique used to create folded paper spheres the researchers said : ‘ no adjustment is necessary			1
if the origami wheels have too much load on them to rotate , they stall , and as the wheel hubs continue to turn , the wheels collapse , which increases their torque until they can move			0
’ because the transmission is continuously variable and automatic , the wheels can respond to loads on the robot by decreasing in diameter until they reach the maximum size at which they can rotate smoothly			2
the scientists think their innovation could one day be used for interplanetary rovers as the wheel can be folded up and ‘ inflate ’ itself			1
the origami wheel can enable the robot ( pictured ) to be both speedy and strong because it expands and shrinks in size			1

scientists were inspired to create the wheels by origami ' magic ball pattern '
they were *joined* by *experts* from @entity70 to *develop* a robot using the **technology** , which can climb steps with ease
the diameter of the wheels grows and shrinks automatically to enable the robot to either be strong or speedy
**technology** could one day be used to build interplanetary rovers
