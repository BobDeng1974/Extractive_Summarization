@entity0 curled home a glorious winner as the @entity4 era at @entity5 started in perfect fashion as leaders @entity7 were left stunned			1
collecting the ball 25 yards from goal , @entity5 ’s @entity9 took one touch to shift the ball and unleashed an unstoppable shot that soared past goalkeeper @entity15 and into the top corner			2
it was even more remarkable given that @entity5 were down to 10 men following @entity20 ’s reckless tackle on @entity21 , which left the visitors numerically disadvantaged for the last half - an - hour			1
@entity0 runs over to the away fans to celebrate his winner with his jubilant @entity5 team - mates @entity7 midfielder @entity27 celebrates his first half opener against @entity4 's @entity5 @entity29 shows @entity20 the red card after his challenge on @entity32 striker @entity21 @entity7 : @entity15 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ( c ) , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity27 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 85 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 81 ) ; @entity42 ( @entity21 60 ) ; @entity43 substitutes not used : @entity44 ( gk ) ; @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 scorer : @entity27 18 booked : @entity27 , @entity35 @entity5 : @entity49 ; @entity50 ( @entity51 59 ; @entity52 67 ) , @entity53 ( c ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 ( @entity57 78 ) , @entity20 , @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity0 substitutes not used : @entity61 ( gk ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 scorers : @entity60 36 ; @entity0 80 booked : @entity55 , @entity0 sent off : @entity20 referee : @entity29 ( @entity67 ) attendance : 11,318 ( 1,438 away ) the win was a deserved one - few sides have come to the @entity70 this season and matched @entity73 ’s title - chasers like this			1
@entity5 had fallen behind to @entity27 ’s opener but levelled through @entity60 and successfully muted @entity7 ’s free - scoring attack			1
it meant the ideal start for @entity4 , the 33 - year - old who moved down to @entity79 from @entity80 this week , and who observed from the stands after giving his first team talk			0
@entity4 , who replaces @entity84 , who resigned on monday after nine months at the helm , now has something solid to build upon as the @entity5 chase the play - off places			1
the unexpected result ended @entity7 ’s unbeaten league run at 14 and keeps this most fascinating of title races wide open			2
with nearest challengers @entity93 losing at home to @entity96 in the lunchtime match , the @entity92 knew they would end the afternoon top of the table unless they found themselves on the wrong end of a hiding			0
@entity73 had taken the opportunity to rest some of his big names in last weekend ’s @entity106 tie at @entity107 - they still won 5 - 1 - but @entity43 , @entity37 , @entity108 returned here			0
@entity5 were also much - changed from the side that lost 2 - 0 at @entity110 in the @entity106 seven days ago , with caretaker boss @entity111 restoring @entity0 , @entity58 and @entity55 among others			1
and the visitors started the brighter with @entity59 heading narrowly over the crossbar in the third minute after @entity116 had retrieved @entity55 ’s over-hit ball wide on the right			0
@entity7 manager @entity73 looks on as his side take an early lead against @entity5 via @entity27 @entity43 ( left ) tries his luck from range and @entity55 ( right ) is tracked by goalscorer @entity27 @entity7 midfielder @entity37 is tackled by @entity5 's @entity123 at the @entity70 new manager @entity4 , watching on from the stands at the @entity70 , would n’t have been too impressed when @entity50 was slow in clearing his lines and allowed @entity43 to steal in and fire just wide from 25 yards			1
@entity5 had been the better side in the opening exchanges but @entity43 ’s warning was n’t heeded			1
on 18 minutes , @entity36 slipped @entity40 clear down the left and he broke beyond @entity50 to deliver the ball			0
@entity27 had timed his back post run to perfection and , after the ball evaded everyone , ghosted in to fire home his seventh of the season			2
it could have been two midway through the first - half when the ball sat up invitingly for @entity40 after @entity43 ’s crafty flick			2
his volley was firm but a little too high			0
@entity4 finds his bearings ahead of his first game in charge of @entity5 against high - flying @entity7 with @entity116 making a nuisance of himself on one wing , @entity55 unafraid to maraud forward on the other and @entity58 storming through the centre , @entity5 carried a decent threat and would soon be level			1
@entity7 were given notice when @entity0 , twisting and turning near the byline , did exceptionally well to turn back inside and forced @entity15 , whose loan from @entity154 was this week extended , to block with his legs			1
five minutes later though , the @entity156 could do nothing as @entity60 blasted home from close range after @entity54 ’s flick header from @entity116 ’s corner			0
after a low - key start to the second period , the game sparked into life once again when @entity20 was shown a straight red card for a very rash two - footed tackle on @entity21			2
@entity36 ( right ) and @entity116 battle for the ball at a chilly @entity70 to compound @entity5 ’s woes , @entity170 pulled up with an injury just a few minutes after coming on and had to be replaced by @entity52			0
as expected , the final 20 minutes were a red and black onslaught			0
@entity27 curled a shot narrowly wide of the far post after @entity37 charged down the right and pulled the ball back			0
and a few minutes later , @entity27 cut infield from the right and sent a low drive close enough to the near post to have @entity49 scrambling			0
but then , incredibly , the 10 - men went in front thanks to @entity0 ’s moment of magic			2
proof , as if it were needed , that you should always expect the unexpected in football			0
