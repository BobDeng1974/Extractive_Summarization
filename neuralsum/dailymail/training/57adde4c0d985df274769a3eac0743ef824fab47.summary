she said : ‘ i think that basically , you ca n’t just be in love with a man			1
i think you have got to admire him and like him			1
because a lot of the other stuff goes away			2
‘ that does n’t have to matter – but i feel that you have to work at marriage			2
you have to like and respect the man you are married to			1
‘ there ’s nothing worse than when we go out to dinner with a couple , and the woman starts to put her husband down and vice versa			1
if you do n’t like each other , then get a divorce			2
we remain married because of those reasons and because we share very simple interests			1
’ speaking to the @entity49 at the launch of her latest novel , secrets from the past , hosted by @entity53 she added : ‘ we like going to the cinema , going to the theatre and reading			0

@entity1 has dedicated each of 29 novels to her husband @entity2 ‘ that ’s the only thing we do n’t agree on , but i never chide him about it			1
i ’ve learned to keep quiet			0
you ’ve got to edit yourself sometimes			0
‘ it ’s knowing when to shut up , because men never do			0
it ’s always women who think , “ i ’ll walk away from an argument ”			0
’ miss @entity1 is regarded as the doyenne of women ’s fiction whose 27 novels , including the hugely popular @entity77 , have sold 88 million copies worldwide			1
she and her husband , a former @entity81 @entity80 refugee , met in @entity82 in 1961 after being introduced by a mutual friend who took them on a blind date			2
at the time , she was 28 and was working as a writer for the @entity87 , while he was already an established film producer , having worked on the @entity89 epic @entity90			0
she said he had immediately made an impression on her because he was wearing a tie			0

the couple have never had children and miss @entity1 has spoken in the past of suffering a miscarriage during the 1960s			0
she said she suspects that she also had a second miscarriage , but says it was too early in the pregnancy to be certain			0
in the past the writer has claimed that they ’ve never had a major row , saying : ‘ we ’ve never said anything like , “ you ’re a son of a bitch			0
