i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about @entity3 , writes @entity4 four years before he died in 1998 , @entity3 did me the honour of asking me to write his biography			1
i spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him			2
when he died , i had unique access to a vast collection of private papers , including numerous intimate letters			0
if there is anyone alive other than @entity3 ’s widow and daughters who knows more about him than i do , i ’d like to meet him			1
i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about @entity3			1
his probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid			0
when on saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the @entity24 , my first instinct was to laugh : but that soon changed into utter outrage when i realised he was serious			1
the @entity24 has publicly accused @entity3 of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay , without the slightest evidence			1
they might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber , for there would be as much truth in either allegation			0
the appalling slurs are just like those made against 91 - year - old @entity38 , a @entity39 veteran and former chief of defence staff , whose homes in @entity42 and @entity43 were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s			2
it is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain			0
but that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains , or consciences , before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion			0
the @entity68 turned against @entity3 in 1968 after the so - called @entity69 ; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal			1
their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who can not defend himself , and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends , was the height of mischief and irresponsibility			0
it is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way , and the @entity24 needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly			1
these @entity91 accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s , including notorious cases in @entity96 and the @entity97 that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids			1
@entity3 , pictured making a speech in 1977 , has been named in a @entity24 review into historic sex abuse when the @entity107 investigated 84 alleged cases , it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse – yet families had been torn apart on the say - so of those who insisted action be taken			1
for decades , @entity3 has long been a bug - bear of the liberal establishment			1
he has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness			0
what better way for some mischievous @entity123 priest to damage @entity3 further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse ? in 1998 , just after @entity3 died , the @entity127 broadcast a programme in which they railed at @entity129 for his hypocrisy			1
they said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the @entity133 in 1953 to recruit black labour for the @entity135			0
i was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that @entity3 had never been to the @entity133 in his life			2
i was told , effectively , that i was lying , and it was broadcast			0
the allegations are a monstrous lie			0
that the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt , writes @entity4 a black clergywoman , then resident in @entity42 , talked at length of @entity3 having recruited her as a nurse			2
detailed investigation by the @entity127 complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by @entity156 , not @entity3 at all , and the @entity157 was forced to make a grovelling on - air apology in peak time			2
i have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and @entity68 figures would stop manipulating @entity3 ’s memory for their own advantage			1
but i never thought i would hear of bishops of the @entity24 doing it			2
the allegations are a monstrous lie			0
that the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt			0
there must be an investigation and , for all the distress this outrage has caused , there must be a reckoning .			0
