by @entity0 it was harder work than many expected			2
and , for a spell , it looked as if a man whose day job involves sticking his hand down cludgies was going to be responsible for plunging @entity10 into crisis			2
yet @entity13 ’s men ultimately managed to avoid having their @entity14 hopes flushed away by @entity15 at @entity17 ’s @entity16 on tuesday night			1
a @entity25 double either side of a @entity24 equaliser , the @entity19 plumber capitalising on a @entity21 howler , was eventually enough to put @entity10 into a second - round tie against @entity27			1
to the rescue : striker @entity25 made sure @entity10 progressed to round two in the @entity29 double : @entity25 heads in his first to put @entity10 on their way to a tense 2 - 1 win against @entity15 with the third - round draw coming on wednesday , they may be presented with the prospect of a truly tantalising reward for getting past the @entity37 side			1
but they ’ll certainly have to improve on this performance in order to overcome @entity27			1
on a night when other teams were playing their second - round ties , @entity10 were clearly eager to make up for lost time in this delayed match			1
@entity15 , decanted from their traditional home while wondrous athletics venue @entity47 is ‘ restored ’ to its natural state as a football ground , were under pressure from the opening moments , only the brilliance of goalkeeper @entity54 preventing the loss of a goal after just two minutes			2
@entity58 ’s cross from the left flank was perfect for the inrushing @entity61 , whose full downward header was somehow diverted off target by the diving @entity54			2
@entity10 had signalled their intent and , after @entity66 — recalled in place of @entity68 who was relegated to the bench — had sent a 25 - yarder fizzing wide , @entity54 quickly found himself beaten			1
howler : @entity21 fails to clear a cross which led to @entity24 scoring @entity15 's equaliser there was nothing the goalie could do as @entity76 was given time and space to pick out a cross from the right wing , @entity25 then doing what he does best , somehow making himself isolated amid a forest of leaping bodies to score with a perfect header			1
there were just seven minutes on the clock and , in truth , such an early opener should have been the cue for an absolute onslaught by the visitors			2
indeed , if @entity96 ’s headed ‘ goal ’ a minute later had n’t fallen foul of an offside flag , it would have been hard to see a way back for the @entity98			2
they clung on despite seeing little ball			2
they watched as @entity10 kept possession , spread play , whipped in crosses , took the odd shot and gradually ran out of momentum			0
the small knot of home fans thought for a moment that they ’d be cheering a penalty when @entity113 — one of three @entity15 players signed from @entity115 in the summer — went down under a @entity96 challenge inside the box			0
no dice , said referee @entity119 , who booked @entity120 for diving just seconds later			0
they would not be denied their moment , though			0
unimpressed : @entity10 boss @entity13 was left frustrated by their performance versus the @entity126 side all it took was one speculative free - kick into the box — and one horrendous misjudgement by @entity21 , the former @entity131 and @entity132 goalie getting nowhere near the ball and watching in agony as the mighty @entity24 ’s looping header completed its slow - motion arc into the net			1
@entity21 spoke just last week about the social media shock he ’d experienced after his @entity141 semi-final error last season			0
best stay off @entity143 for another wee while , @entity145			0
not that the big @entity146 would have been alone in attracting the ire of @entity10 fans during a fairly unimaginative first half			0
it was hardly surprising that they ran out late for the second 45 ; if @entity13 did n’t have a lengthy lecture to deliver , there would have been something very wrong			1
there was certainly more tempo about the visitors after the break , @entity159 stooping to head an effort off target just two minutes in			0
it was no more than a half chance , @entity58 having drilled the ball in from close range on the right after a free - kick play had set the @entity169 ’s defence back on their heels			1
their second goal arrived from similarly broken play , a series of crosses and balls into the box causing havoc before @entity66 ’s chipped cross found an unmarked @entity25 ready , willing and more than able to nod the ball into an empty net			0
close : @entity159 stoops in for a header which nearly led to a goal for @entity13 's @entity185 side and surely a sign that the storm had been weathered by a superior team who would now add a third or fourth by way of insurance			1
in practice , while @entity58 saw a point - blank shot blocked by @entity195 and @entity96 sent a low drive cracking off the foot of the post , the visitors continued to be troubled by their hosts			1
from @entity159 gifting possession by trying to be too clever , to @entity21 grinning in gratitude as @entity204 directed a back - post header straight at him , there was nothing comfortable about @entity10 ’ lead			1
still , in @entity209 , they had the best player on the park			0
he was involved in all their brightest moments , including a corner that saw @entity159 ’s goal - bound heard cleared off the line by @entity113 late on			1
looking forward to the next round , @entity10 boss @entity13 said : ‘ let ’s be honest , @entity220 are the in - form team in the country at the moment			1
they ’ve not lost a goal			0
we will certainly have to be more disciplined — but the good thing is we get a chance to play them at home now			0
‘ i was pulling my hair out in the first half , with the number of free - kicks we were giving away			2
our lack of discipline was a big concern			0
‘ for their goal , once @entity237 comes , he has to get it			0
i ’m not sure he had to come , i ’ll watch the video tomorrow			0
‘ there are positives to be taken , the biggest one being that we now have a home tie against @entity27			1
but there are negatives i need to look at			0

@entity13 's side struggled to 2 - 1 *victory* against @entity253 side
