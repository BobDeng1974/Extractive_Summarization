when @entity1 signed @entity2 for just £ 6 million in july , @entity0 hailed the capture as a ' coup '			1
once again the club 's transfer model – headed by chief scout @entity7 – was lauded as the envy of @entity9			0
but @entity10 was no secret – he was , after all , a title - winning @entity12 captain and @entity14 international who had scored three times against @entity17 in the @entity18			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity2 has been ruled out for at least eight weeks with a collapsed lung the former @entity12 star signed for @entity1 last summer for a £ 6million fee but has struggled with injuries why , then , did @entity1 land the attacking midfielder virtually unopposed and at a seemingly bargain price ? perhaps now we know			1
worryingly , @entity1 should have known in the summer			2
it was confirmed on tuesday that @entity10 will miss the next two months because of a collapsed lung , the second time in 18 months he has been hospitalised with such a serious problem			1
now a collapsed lung is scary enough , a recurring collapsed lung is terrifying			1
this is n't a calf , hamstring or thigh strain – although he has suffered from each of those – this is a vital organ breaking down , again			0
the 26 - year - old was only days away from a return to action after five months out with a torn thigh muscle when the @entity43 revealed he had undergone surgery on his lung			2
before the thigh problem he had missed much of pre-season with a calf injury			0
indeed , @entity10 has made just one start and one substitute appearance in the @entity51 for @entity1			0
it was in august , 2013 that he was first sidelined with a collapsed lung			1
he returned but his progress was hampered by niggling muscle strains			0
in addition to his lung problems , @entity10 's career has been blighted by a series of recurring muscle strains before his injury - hit 2013 - 2014 campaign , @entity10 had scored over 15 goals in four consecutive seasons interestingly , @entity1 had been watching the player for 14 months before bringing him to @entity65 – @entity7 , @entity0 and @entity66 had all checked in on the elegant playmaker			1
they were prepared to discount last season and instead focused on his undoubted pedigree – for he 'd barely missed a game during the previous four campaigns in which he scored north of 15 goals on each occasion			0
but @entity10 's own comments about his initial lung episode – and his subsequent struggle for fitness – should read as a warning , and perhaps concern , for @entity1 going forward			1
' it ( the collapsed lung ) was quite scary , ' he said			2
' it happened at the beginning of the season , and after that i had to be in bed for a couple of weeks			0
' looking back afterwards , we did n't focus enough on my entire body and focused too much on the lung			0
' the lung was good after three weeks but the rest of the body just was n't strong enough to play games , and that 's what we forgot a little			2
' during the season i had some other small injuries which was part of not being strong enough			0
' while playing for @entity12 , @entity10 scored three times against @entity17 in the @entity18 @entity10 won four back - to - back @entity102 titles between 2010 and 2014 and has six caps for @entity14 and that is the worry for @entity1 , not only the fear of a recurrence , but the impact a collapsed lung has on the strength of the body			1
there is a precedent in these parts			0
former @entity115 cricketer @entity114 – brother of @entity117 defender , @entity116 – twice suffered a collapsed lung during his career and was plagued by other injuries , eventually forcing his retirement last year			1
@entity10 is unlikely to feature until the final weeks of this season , meaning his campaign will have been written - off by injury			2
having signed him to a six - year contract , @entity1 can only hope we are n't writing that again			2
@entity1 fans will hope that the man hailed as @entity131 's replacement can return to full fitness soon			0
