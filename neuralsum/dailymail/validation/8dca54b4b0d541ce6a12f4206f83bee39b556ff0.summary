@entity0 has repeated a familiar rallying call by predicting @entity2 will inflict a 5 - 0 ashes whitewash on @entity4 this summer			1
the former pace attack leader of @entity2 's all - conquering test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for @entity4 in the past , and has been embarrassed when @entity2 have not performed as he expected , notably in the 2005 series			2
he played a part in @entity2 triumphing 5 - 0 @entity10 in 2006 - 07 , and again envisaged the same result in @entity4 in 2009 , only for @entity12 to lead the home side to their triumph			1
@entity0 has predicted a 5 - 0 whitewash for @entity2 when they travel to @entity4 this summer @entity0 was a constant tormentor of @entity4 in @entity3 series during his playing days @entity20 ' side have suffered a terrible @entity21 but will hope to bounce back in test cricket @entity0 had more recently refrained from trumpeting @entity2 as unbeatable by @entity4 , even prior to their 5 - 0 demolition job in 2013 - 14 , but that is how he again positions @entity27 's test team			1
with @entity4 toiling to sorry effect at the @entity21 , @entity0 is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited - overs skipper @entity31 returns to take the helm of the five - day team			2
he told @entity34 : ' if the @entity36 team keeps playing as they are , they 're going to go to @entity4 full of confidence			0
@entity4 were knocked out of the @entity21 by @entity38 last week , and @entity0 ca n't see them improving during his playing days @entity0 made a habit of predicting whitewashes , and was not always proved right ' i ca n't see @entity4 beating them and i 'm more than happy to predict 5 - 0			1
' @entity0 , 45 , expects the @entity21 debacle to be followed by change in the @entity4 camp			0
he said : ' i thought they struggled to take wickets or build up any pressure and they did n't look potent at all			0
' there are going to be changes , whether it 's coaching or the players			0
a lot of responsibility lies with the players			0

@entity0 thinks @entity4 will lose 5 - 0 to @entity2
@entity2 won the last series , at home , by the same score
@entity4 have been poor at the one day @entity21
but @entity31 will hope return to @entity65 will aid his side
