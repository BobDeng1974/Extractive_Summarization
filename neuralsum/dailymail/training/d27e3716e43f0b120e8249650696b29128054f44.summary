by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 14 august 2013 @entity2 's idea for his latest photography project was simple - so simple he did it standing on his head			1
the 23 - year - old turned the art of self - portrait upside - down with pictures from his road trip - doing headstands across @entity11			1
the photographer from @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity11 , went topsy - turvy from the edge of the @entity17 to the deserts of @entity19 to produce a playful portrait collection that sees him observing the world from upside down			1
head over heels : @entity2 said his @entity17 was the ' craziest ' of his headstand locations footloose : the photographer threw caution to the wind when he performed the stunt in the @entity30 on the @entity31 and @entity32 fresh perspective : the pictures were taken on a road trip around some of the most stunning sites in @entity11 , such as @entity38 in @entity19 mr @entity2 came up with the idea after he spotted a girl doing a headstand in a park in @entity43			1
he was at the park with a group of friends from @entity47 , @entity48 , the day before they were due to set off on a road trip around @entity11			2
despite a painstaking lesson from the girl and hours trying to master the stunt , mr @entity2 just could n't do it			2
but he refused to stand around and be ridiculed by his friends , and when they made their first stop on the road trip he tried again			0
he was thrilled when he finally mastered it - and celebrated by continuing to perform headstands throughout their three - week trip and asking his friends to photograph him			2
and as these images show , mr @entity2 performed the precarious balancing act in a skate park , a cemetery , in the @entity30 and even on the edge of a cliff			1
mr @entity2 said : ' i 'd tried for hours to do a headstand in the park that day but for the life of me i just could n't do it			2
spot the skateboard : @entity2 set up unusual shots in some more mundane locations , such as this picture from @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 head over heels : mr @entity2 was inspired by the photographic potential of this fallen roof in @entity81 , @entity14 @entity82 : @entity2 's friends stood on hand to take this picture of him on the edge of @entity87 , rocks , @entity14 @entity89 : @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , provided the backdrop for this shot feet of clay : the lap of this @entity98 statue in the @entity99 of the @entity100 became another perfect headrest road stand : @entity103 in @entity13 , @entity14 , inspired the young photographer to take this artistic headstand shot @entity106 : presumably no cars came along this deserted - looking road in @entity109 , @entity110 , while @entity2 was taking his photograph ' i was so determined to do it so when i finally did , i was so excited			1
' it became a bit of a joke for me for me to do a headstand everywhere we stopped			0
' i 'd read about other self - portrait projects where people had taken photos of themselves across @entity11 , so when i finally managed the headstand it seemed like a great idea to use that as an idea for my next project			1
' we were on the road for around three weeks we went from @entity43 to @entity92 , @entity19 , along the @entity129 to the @entity17 , @entity77 , @entity130 and finished in @entity13			0
' i 'd do a headstand picture every day of the trip , sometimes i 'd do two or three a day it really depended on our surroundings			0
if the landscape changed a lot that day i 'd usually do more than one picture			0
' we were at the mercy of the landscape really			0
i 'd always look for the most unusual locations and the edge of the @entity17 was definitely the craziest			0
upside - dune : the incredible inland @entity144 in the @entity145 , @entity146 , made a soft cushion at this stop on @entity2 's journey head banger : a quick musical interlude at a piano at @entity153 gave @entity2 the chance to mix his photo series up a bit head of state : @entity2 takes his stunt to the @entity159 in @entity160 @entity161 : @entity2 did another headstand when he visited @entity163 , @entity91 , @entity92 , along the @entity164 headstand tall : @entity2 straightened up next to the trees in @entity166 , @entity14 ' the road trip was in 2012 but the project is still going if i spot somewhere cool i just have to do a headstand and get someone to take my picture			1
' sometimes i 'm on my own and i ask a member of the public to take my photo			0
' they just think i want a normal tourist photo , so they 're pretty shocked when i suddenly do a headstand , it can be quite funny			0
