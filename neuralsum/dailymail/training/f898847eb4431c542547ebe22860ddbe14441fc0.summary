documents show that crime tsar @entity1 knew in advance about the scale of the child abuse the crime tsar defying calls for his resignation over the @entity10 child grooming scandal came under fresh pressure to quit last night after @entity12 uncovered damning proof that he ignored a mass of evidence of abuse			1
@entity1 , the police and crime commissioner for @entity19 , has claimed the scale of the crisis was a ‘ huge surprise ’ to him after a report revealed at least 1,400 girls in @entity10 were abused by gangs of predominantly @entity26 men			1
but a dossier of more than 20 files provides powerful evidence that in his former post as cabinet member for children ’s services in @entity10 , mr @entity1 must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse			1
minutes from @entity10 ’s @entity40 ( @entity41 ) – which would have been passed to him – reveal that : @entity43 was frustration among agencies about the difficulties in holding to account those adults who organised or took part in the sexual exploitation of children			0
@entity43 were not enough resources to cope with the level of need			0
last night , @entity53 , a solicitor representing 15 of the victims , said mr @entity1 should resign immediately			1
‘ the figures were available to him and i fail to see how he could have been unaware of the scale , ’ he said			0
a council source added : ‘ these minutes would have passed across @entity1 ’s desk without any question			1
did he read them ? if he did n’t , he should have done			0
and whether he did or not , he should hang his head in shame and resign			0
’ mr @entity1 has quit the @entity66 but has refused demands to leave his £ 85,000 - a - year @entity69 post			2
the dossier of quarterly minutes from the @entity41 – made up of education , health , police and social workers – charts the growth of grooming and predatory behaviour to near - epidemic proportions throughout the five years that mr @entity1 was @entity10 ’s cabinet member for children ’s services , from 2005 until 2010			1
although his attendance at the quarterly @entity41 meetings was not compulsory , it was part of the board ’s responsibility to pass the minutes on to him – and part of his to read them			0
sections of a dossier which shows that @entity1 was alerted to the scale of the scandal in @entity10 documents show between 2007 and 2010 alone , the number of sexually exploited children – mostly girls – coming to the notice of social services and youth workers each year increased more than tenfold from 45 to 483			1
our evidence also shows that over five years the problem of sexual exploitation was frequently discussed , and that the rapidly growing scale of the problem was readily apparent			0
in the minutes and attached reports seen by @entity12 , the overwhelming magnitude of the problem is obvious as the numbers of young people in contact with either council staff or the specialist outreach youth workers of a group called @entity115 , grows out of control			2
last night , mr @entity1 failed to respond to messages			2
his spokeswoman said he was ‘ unavailable ’ .			0

some 1,400 young girls were abused by gangs of predominantly @entity26 men
@entity1 claimed he was unaware about the size of the abuse scandal
however , new documents show he knew of the problem in *october* 2005
