by @entity0 last updated at 7:02 pm on 14th november 2011 a video interview with @entity2 in 1987 offers a disturbing look into the earlier mind of the man now charged with 40 counts of sexual assault after sexually abusing at least eight young boys			1
the former defensive line coach for @entity11 's football team was at the height of his career when he was interviewed by @entity14 , talking about the charity he formed to help underprivileged youth			2
now , in light of the scandal that broke last saturday , it is confirmed that he used that same charity as a way to pick his victims			2
' i enjoy their enthusiasm			2
i just have a good time with them			1
' @entity2 created @entity36 as a charity to help underprivileged @entity39 youth , often in need of foster homes			1
the court report filed against @entity2 says the self - described mission of the charity was to ' help children who need additional support and would benefit from positive human interaction '			1
@entity2 was very much the head of the program until he retired last year , and was the emotional leader of the organization , respected and admired by the children as a fatherly figure both because of his charity and because of his position in the @entity11 football program			2
' spending time ' : the interview shows @entity2 playing sports and swimming with the children from @entity36 founder : @entity2 created @entity36 in 1977 and now it is known that is where he chose his victims ' one of the biggest things would be the trust that would developed , ' he said of his goals for the program			1
' what we 're trying to be is , what we think to be of , is a true friend			0
' everybody needs people to care for them			0
' he alludes to his role as a disciplinarian as well , which has an underlying message after having read the court reports which describe his sexual interactions with unwilling young boys			0
' sometimes they do n't want it , sometimes they do n't understand what you 're trying to do but they want to be disciplined , ' he said			0
' kids are growing up awfully fast today			0
' leaders : head coach @entity94 ( left ) was already a legend in the late eighties and @entity2 was considered his second - in - command , making him a football celebrity on his own ( right ) resigned : @entity98 , former ceo of @entity36 , resigned amid allegations that @entity2 found his victims through the organization the damage of the allegations continues to spread as the charity announced sunday that dr. @entity98 , who has served as the ceo of @entity36 for the past 28 years , resigned , saying that he and the board of directors felt it was in ' the best interest ' of the organization			1
this old interview and the removal of mr @entity98 from @entity36 comes just as one of @entity2 's victims hired an attorney to pursue a civil suit against anyone who potentially knew about the abuse and did nothing			1
the lawyer , @entity119 , represents one of the unnamed victims and would not give any clues as to which one , but said that his client is ' torn up ' about the entire situation			1
' it 's important to understand that these folks were involved in the @entity127 , ' mr @entity119 said in an interview with the @entity129			0
' they were on the sidelines of football games , they were spending significant amounts of time travelling with the team and or in the locker room with the team and getting to know members of that football team			0
to say that he 's torn apart would be an emotion would really explain where he 's at right now , ' he continued			0
lawyered up : @entity119 is pursuing a civil lawsuit for one of the victims against anyone who knew of the abuse but did not report it to police or law enforcement officials because of the victims close ties to @entity11 , and really the town of @entity155 as a whole , the ripple effects of the scandal are hard for mr @entity119 's client to handle			1
' the general public may think that an abuse victim in his position would automatically have feelings of negativity towards the university and while i think he 's very disappointed in the way that members of the @entity11 community handled his situation or the situation involving the cove rup , it 's a complex issue and we need to understand that he has a variety of thoughts going through his head right now , ' mr @entity119 said			2
the civil suit is the first of its kind in this scandal , as so far @entity2 and two other university administrators have only been criminally charged			1
disturbing : ' sometimes they do n't want it , sometimes they do n't understand what you 're trying to do but they want to be disciplined , ' he said in the 1987 interview @entity188 , the governor of @entity39 , thinks that this is not the end of the case either and he expects more victims to come forward now that the incidents are public			2
' when the word gets out , when people understand that authorities are actually doing something about this , that they may be believed , then more people come forward , mr @entity188 said to @entity199			0
" ' if i had to speculate i would n't be surprised if we had more victims come forward			0
' watch video here visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy			0

first civil suit is being pursued by one of the unnamed victims , looking to charge anyone who knew about the sexual abuse but failed to report it to police
@entity2 : ' i enjoy their enthusiasm . i just have a good time with them . '
@entity39 governor says there are likely more victims to come
the *president* of @entity2 's charity resigned sunday night
