by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 made a passionate plea for @entity4 not to quit the @entity5 yesterday but suggested @entity6 can hope to achieve only limited reform before a referendum			1
the @entity10 chancellor used a visit to @entity12 to back the prime minister ’s calls for a clampdown on @entity5 migrants ’ right to claim benefits and indicated the @entity4 and non-eurozone countries could win concessions as the eurozone integrates further			1
but she warned she would disappoint @entity4 calls for her to commit now to fundamental reform of the @entity5 – and dodged any promise of the full - scale treaty changes			1
but accommodating @entity4 ’s demands could be done , she said			2
mrs @entity2 was treated like a visiting monarch as she called on mr @entity6 in @entity47			2
the government rolled out the red carpet for mrs @entity2 , whose support is seen as pivotal to mr @entity6 ’s hopes of securing reform of @entity30			2
she was afforded the rare honour of making a speech to both houses of @entity56 , gathered together in the @entity57 , and later visited the @entity36 at @entity34			1
@entity58 and goat 's curd salad with citrus dressing @entity63 fillet of @entity65 stone bass with potatoes , broccoli and beans ; @entity69 and ice cream dessert			0
in her address , she suggested @entity4 could not expect to be treated as a special case and warned those expecting her to promise a fundamental shake - up of the @entity5 at this stage would be disappointed			1
however , she was more positive when asked in @entity47 whether she would support mr @entity6 ’s attempts to negotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship with @entity30 ahead of a referendum the @entity82 have committed to holding in 2017 if they are still in power			1
‘ i firmly believe that what we are discussing here is feasible , is doable , ’ she said after a 90 - minute meeting over lunch in the prime minister ’s @entity47 flat			0
‘ where there ’s a will there ’s a way			0
’ there was plenty of space between the two leaders as they posed for this photograph , later tweeted by the prime minister @entity10 chancellor @entity2 insisted @entity43 does need to reform but she would disappoint many demands from @entity4 mrs @entity2 addressed mps and peers from both houses of @entity56 in the @entity105 of the @entity106 @entity4 prime minister @entity6 : ' we need fundamental , far - reaching change			1
' ( january 2013 ) @entity10 chancellor @entity2 : ' i have heard some expect my speech to pave for a fundamental reform of the @entity43 architecture which will satisfy all kinds of alleged or actual @entity4 wishes			1
i am afraid they are in for a disappointment			0
' ( february 2014 ) she also suggested that she agreed freedom of movement rules should be amended to restrict rights to claim benefits , saying it was wrong that a new immigrant could claim the same level of handouts as people who had paid into the system for several years			0
‘ that would not be the interpretation of freedom of movement that i would have , ’ she said			0
‘ that is just as much of a headache for us in @entity10 as it is for the @entity4 people			1
’ she suggested she was ready to agree reforms that would mean new rights for countries who are not members of the single currency			0
‘ if one wants @entity4 to remain in the @entity5 – which is what i want – if one at the same time wants a competitive union ... one can find common solutions			1
’ however , mrs @entity2 warned mr @entity6 that it would not be a ‘ piece of cake ’ for changes to be agreed across the @entity5			1
she also said that @entity10 was grateful to @entity4 for placing trust in her country following the @entity157 and ‘ the break in civilisation ’ represented by the @entity160			2
speaking in the anniversary year of the outbreak of the @entity162 , she said : ‘ this is a special year of commemoration for @entity4 , where you remember your dead , your losses and the untold suffering that @entity10 brought through these wars to you			2
‘ as @entity10 chancellor , i bow my head before the victims of these horrible wars			1
’ prime minister @entity6 smiled during the speech , but there was little sign of a major breakthrough in his demands for reform			1

she was n’t going to suddenly offer a whole load of concessions			0
‘ what ’s important is how good relations are between @entity6 and @entity2			2
he has vetoed a treaty , promised an in / out referendum , cut the @entity5 budget against everyone ’s wishes , and still @entity2 comes over here and is extremely friendly and positive			0
’ @entity201 mp @entity200 , another @entity202 , was less convinced , saying : ‘ she made it clear the direction of travel is “ more @entity43 ” – closer economic and political integration			0
’ the lavish reception for mrs @entity2 was in stark contrast to the welcome given to @entity211 president @entity210 last month			0
on a windswept @entity213 base , mr @entity6 and mr @entity210 publicly disagreed about the need for @entity5 reform before heading for a low key lunch at a village pub. mr @entity210 said giving the @entity4 people a say on leaving the @entity5 was ' not urgent ' and insisted he would do little to assist mr @entity6 's push for reform			1

the two men later endured a low key pub lunch but the @entity211 appeared to want a quick getaway @entity229 , @entity182 ’s foreign affairs spokesman , said : ‘ chancellor @entity2 ’s remarks have confirmed that @entity6 ’s approach to @entity43 just is n’t working			2
’ but @entity182 mp @entity233 said mrs @entity2 has also created a big problem for @entity182			0

‘ @entity181 ca n’t accept either , ’ he added .			0
