up to two million obese @entity0 will be eligible for weight - loss surgery on the @entity2 under new guidelines			1
file picture up to two million obese @entity0 will be eligible for weight - loss surgery on the @entity2 under new guidelines			1
the health watchdog @entity5 is telling doctors to suggest the operations to all patients above a given weight with type 2 diabetes			1
if all those in that group took up the offer it would cost the @entity2 £ 12billion			2
@entity5 hopes to treble the number of such procedures carried out by the health service to at least 15,000 a year – an extra annual outlay of £ 90million			2
the move comes as the @entity2 struggles to meet targets for what many would regard as more urgent operations			1
it was revealed in april that nearly three million people were on waiting lists for surgery or other hospital procedures , including almost 550 who had been waiting for more than a year			0
@entity30 , chief executive of the @entity2 , said : ‘ the need for so much bariatric [ weight loss ] surgery graphically illustrates the price of failure in preventing obesity			2
' do we want a future where our children die younger than their parents and where the @entity2 is brought to its knees by entirely avoidable illness ? that ’s the stark choice facing our country			2
’ @entity5 has concluded procedures such as gastric bypass operations and gastric bands are the best way to treat obesity , which can lead to type 2 diabetes			1
but experts accused the watchdog of ignoring ‘ swathes of evidence ’ that cutting calories is just as effective and far less expensive than surgery			0
the @entity5 guidance advises anyone with a @entity60 over 30 and type 2 diabetes should be considered for surgery			1
this is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 13st 9lb , or a 5ft 11in man at 15st 6lb			0
the @entity2 already spends £ 10billion a year treating type 2 diabetes and around one in six hospital beds are taken up by a patient with the condition			1
@entity5 states surgery can drastically improve the illness , prevent complications and in some cases reverse it			0
professor @entity76 , of the watchdog ’s @entity77 , said : ‘ the numbers of people classified as obese has nearly doubled over the last 20 years and continues to rise			0
‘ it is a major issue , if not the major issue , for the health service in the coming years			0
‘ the value of weight loss surgery to diabetics is one of the best we have come across in our guidance … we think this is one of the things the @entity2 should invest more in			2
’ @entity5 hopes to treble the number of such procedures carried out by the health service to at least 15,000 a year but professor @entity93 , of the @entity94 at @entity95 , @entity96 , said : ‘ they have missed swathes of evidence			2
‘ the @entity5 guidance could send tens of thousands of @entity0 towards unnecessary surgery , with its known morbidity and mortality , and costing taxpayers many millions of pounds , when all that is required is a different dietary and lifestyle approach , including the use of low carbohydrate diets and low , and very low , calorie diets			0
‘ while surgery has its place , it must remain a last resort			0
’ @entity115 , chief executive of charity @entity116 , added : ‘ while weight loss surgery for type 2 diabetes is an important treatment option , it should not be seen as the definitive remedy that can fix the type 2 epidemic on its own			1
‘ in particular , it makes no sense that the @entity2 is currently spending more on bariatric surgery than it is on preventative measures to stop people from getting type 2 diabetes in the first place			1
’ obese children with type 2 diabetes could be offered the operations but it is only recommended once they have been through puberty so the youngest eligible patients would be 12 or 13			1
the most effective procedure is a gastric bypass operation whereby surgeons create a small pouch at the top of the stomach			0
they connect this directly to the small intestine , bypassing the rest of the stomach so that patients only need small amounts of food before they feel full			0
this causes them to lose weight very quickly and , crucially , it also lowers their blood sugar – which is a key factor in tackling diabetes			0
the type 2 form of the condition causes kidney failure , strokes and loss of sight , and sufferers ’ feet may need to be amputated due to nerve damage			1
@entity5 said that 60 per cent of diabetic patients no longer need medication after weight - loss procedures and that the remainder are able to cut back on pills or insulin injections			1
but not all sufferers will want the surgery and many cash - strapped @entity2 trusts may refuse to fund it			0
there is also a risk – around one in 1,000 patients die from a cardiac arrest , while one in 100 suffer either blood clots or internal bleeding			0
about 4,200 weight - loss operations are carried out on the @entity2 each year , including around 20 on children as young as 13			1
the most common are gastric bypass operations but others include gastric bands or gastric balloons .			0
