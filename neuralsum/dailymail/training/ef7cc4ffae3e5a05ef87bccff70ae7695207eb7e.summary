by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:36 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:56 est , 27 february 2014 a three - year - old heart patient died after a glitch with a new @entity7 computer system left him without a check - up appointment for 20 months			1
@entity10 underwent complex cardiac surgery aged nine months at the scandal - hit @entity12			1
he was recovering well and was due to have regular check - up appointments and scans at a different hospital nearer his home in @entity19 , @entity20			1
@entity10 , three , died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check - up for 20 months			1
he was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old but his family claim teething problems with a new booking system meant he ' dropped off the appointments list ' and did not receive a crucial follow - up scan for 20 months			1
by this time , his condition had deteriorated considerably and he underwent a second operation during which he suffered a stroke			1
further complications followed and he died in the arms of his parents @entity35 and @entity37 a month later			1
the couple have now condemned the lack of care that was given to their son after his operation			0
in a statement , they said : ' he was a beautiful boy			0
he was smart , clever , he had good vocabulary , he had lots of friends , went to nursery , he had a nice life with plenty of time with his family and friends , he was well loved			0
' in 20 months , he went from having a healthy heart to a bad one			1
it was n't as it he had poor care in that time - he had no care at all			2
' it was not in our understanding that this was going to have to happen			0
' @entity10 was born with a restricted pulmonary artery meaning blood could now easily flow away from his heart to his lungs			1
@entity10 had an operation at @entity12 and he was recovering well initially			1
however , his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check - up he underwent surgery at the @entity12 , which has been at the centre of a recent scandal involving a number of baby deaths			1
the surgery went well and he was due to have regular follow - up appointments at the @entity76 at the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) in @entity78 after being discharged			2
but his appointments became ' sporadic ' and his parents claim they often had to chase the hospital over the scheduled dates			0
they allege their community nurse contacted the hospital for a check - up on five occasions but with no success			1
a subsequent report has suggested a new computer - based patient booking system introduced at the @entity77 in 2011 was to blame			2
according to a @entity91 request , it caused 63 overdue appointments - one of which was @entity10 's			2
some took nearly two years to discover			0
@entity10 was due to have his check ups at @entity77 , @entity78 , but they became sporadic			1
a report has suggested a new computer - based patient booking system introduced at the @entity77 in 2011 was to blame @entity10 last received a heart scan in october 2010 but this was not repeated for another 20 months because of booking problems			1
unbeknown to his family , his cardiac condition was slowly deteriorating and by the time he was seen by his cardiologist in june 2012 , he required another operation			2
but the heart unit in @entity107 was unable to schedule this until august and he was so frail by this point he needed a month in intensive care afterwards			0
he died on september 6 2012 in the arms of his parents			0
minutes of board meetings at the @entity77 a year before @entity10 's death reveal there were ' significant issues with ... data that had not been migrated which affected ... long - term follow - up appointments '			2
ms @entity35 said : ' they should have reverted back to the old system until the new one was working properly			0
' by the time @entity10 's failing health was diagnosed he was very weak and he had to have more heart surgery			1
he died a month later following complications			2
an inquest into his death is due to open at @entity127 ( pictured ) on monday an inquest into @entity10 's death is due to be opened on monday at @entity130 , near @entity107 , and is expected to last four days			0
an @entity77 spokesman said : ' we have offered our sincere condolences to the family of @entity10 following his sad death			0
' the coroner 's inquest will be held very soon and we hope that this will provide both @entity10 's family and everyone involved in his care , with a clearer indication of the circumstances surrounding his death			0
' a @entity145 spokeswoman added : ' we strive to do our best for every child in our care and it is a matter of great sadness to us when a child dies			0
' we are committed to learn from every poor experience and to do all we can to look back and examine whether there are any areas where we can improve our practice or make other changes that ensure a better experience for future families			0
' the coroner will conduct a thorough and independent inquiry into @entity162 € ™ s death and we are committed to working with her to provide all the information she needs to do this and to respond promptly to any recommendations that she may make			0
' it would not be appropriate for us to comment further until the inquest has concluded but we would like to offer our sincere condolences to the @entity10 family for their tragic loss			0
