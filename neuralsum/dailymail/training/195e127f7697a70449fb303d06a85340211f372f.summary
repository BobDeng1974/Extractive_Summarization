the @entity0 entertainment network has apologized to @entity2 after viewers witnessed a grossly insensitive screen graphic which referred to his diagnosis with @entity6 as a ' fun fact '			1
@entity8 exploded with rage at the network for its message which declared that the popular 52 - year - old @entity13 and @entity14 actor has been suffering the degenerative condition for 22 - years			1
responding to the widely condemned screen graphic , @entity0 issued a statement to @entity18 , saying , ' we regret the insensitive classification of @entity2 's @entity6 's diagnosis during our @entity23 live stream			1
we understand the serious nature of the disease and sincerely apologize			2
' the graphic was shown during @entity0 's live stream of red carpet coverage sunday , although not on tv			1
as the actor was entering the @entity34 @entity33 , the ' fun fact ' graphic noted @entity36 's diagnosis in 1991			1
@entity2 was nominated for best actor in a comedy for his new @entity40 show			1
insensitive : @entity43 viewers were horrified when @entity0 's idea of some light hearted information about @entity2 [ pictured with wife @entity46 ] included details on his illness @entity6 horrified : the @entity49 erupted in outrage after @entity0 shared this ' fun fact ' during the @entity43 outrage : this @entity8 user clearly expressed their thoughts on the decision to label @entity2 's diagnosis with @entity6 a fun fact anger : the popular actor has bravely continued to work despite his diagnosis with the degenerative condition and @entity8 was extremely critical of @entity0 a barrage of tweets blasted the message with user @entity66 writing : ' in what world is this considered to be a " fun " fact ( sic ) , ' @entity61 wrote ' not a fun fact at all ( sic ) , ' and @entity70 fumed ' somewhere , a graphics person should be fired			1
' the gaffe led to a series of memes on @entity8 with users inserting their own insensitive messages into the fact box			1
these included ' 37 cats died during the making of @entity81 ' and ' there is no afterlife , just eternal nothingness ' @entity2 , who rose to fame on @entity86 and went on the star in the @entity13 movies , was diagnosed with @entity6 in 1991			1
another fun fact : mocking @entity0 and their @entity2 graphic - twitter and the @entity92 set to work to make fun of their serious error is this fun ? this fact seems to take the mocking of @entity0 slightly further in reference to the @entity101 new movie he attended the awards looking dapper in a black suit with his wife @entity105 , who looked beautiful in a full length blue dress with a gold clutch			1
while @entity36 has struggled with his fate over the years he previously said he would n't change his diagnosis even if he could			0
' if i walked into a room with @entity113 or @entity114 or @entity115 or @entity116 or whoever could figure out a way to fix it for me , i do n't think i 'd do it , ' he told @entity120			0
‘ because i would n't have gone through what i 've gone through and i would n't have had the experience i 've had , and i can still do my s * * t. at the end of the day i can still do a show			0
so what have i lost ? ' ' the point is , we all have our bag of hammers			0
we all have our own s * * t. it 's like the parable about this circle of people and everyone takes their worst problem and puts it in the middle and they all get to choose one to take back – and they all end up choosing their own			1
and that 's kind of it			1
you 'd always take your own problems back over someone else 's			2
' after a multiple year absence from a full time sitcom , the @entity86 star made his return to television with @entity40 's the @entity152 last year			2
diagnosis : @entity2 , who rose to fame on @entity86 and went on the star in the @entity13 movies , was diagnosed with @entity6 in 1991 ' i like the idea of having started playing the son on a family show , ' he said			1
' then an adult in a workplace , and now playing a middle - aged father at home			0
it 's nice – it 's a good arc			2
' the actor is somewhat of a medical anomaly			2
he was told that he would have to step away from the big and small screen within 10 years of his original diagnosis			0
' i just do n't tell myself that i ca n't do it , ' he explained			0
' then i just do it			0
a show is easier to regulate than life			0
there 's no surprises , really			2
you know what you have to do in a given day , and you rest and medicate accordingly			0
i 'm shocked at how much easier this is than i thought it would be			0
' the @entity14 star has n't always had it so easy , though			0
not too long after he was first diagnosed , he slipped into alcoholism , using the haze of booze to numb the pain			0
@entity2 had been married to @entity86 co-star @entity46 for only three years and the couple had a son - @entity190 - when he got the news			1
' i was at a loss as to how to deal with it , ' he says			0
' the idea of , " did i suck this woman into a bum deal and have a kid right away and then fall into this situation ? " it was much easier to have a buzz going and not deal with the reality of it			0
' the actor subsequently entered treatment and now has four children with @entity46			2
medical anomaly : the actor is somewhat of a medical anomaly as he was told that he would have to step away from the big and small screen within 10 years of his original diagnosis			2

the @entity0 entertainment network is apologizing to actor @entity2 for an online graphic during its @entity43 coverage that listed his @entity6 as a ' fun fact '
*social* media lit up in fury after the graphic appeared during @entity0 's live stream coverage
