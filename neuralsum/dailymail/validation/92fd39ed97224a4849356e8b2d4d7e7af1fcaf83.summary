@entity1 chairman @entity0 has described as ‘ pretty scary ’ the increase in disciplinary cases brought against players surrounding referees to try to influence decisions			1
@entity0 was speaking out a week after @entity9 ’s @entity8 defeat by @entity10 during which nine @entity9 players crowded around the @entity13 referee @entity12 following @entity15 ’s challenge on @entity16 which resulted in the @entity18 talisman being sent off			1
the @entity1 clampdown on such incidents has seen an increase in clubs in the top five divisions – from the @entity24 to the conference - charged with ' surrounding match officials ' ( three or more players from one club approach a match official in a confrontational manner ) from six last season to 16 with another three months of the campaign still to go			1
@entity32 , @entity33 and their @entity9 team - mates surround referee @entity12 all nine outfield @entity9 players remonstrate with @entity12 as @entity16 is left in a heap on the floor warnings or reminders are also up from 23 last campaign to 29 during 2014 - 2015			1
@entity0 said : ' we have seen a pretty scary increase this season in the number of clubs charged with their players surrounding referees			2
as a result we have written to the clubs in the top five divisions reminding them of the rules and their responsibilities			0
' i believe it is particularly important for professional cubs to set an example so that this kind of conduct is not replicated at grassroots and youth level			0
the whole game needs to ensure it is addressing this issue			0
’ the rapid increase in @entity1 charges follows not only the december letter sent to 116 teams but also visits to clubs last summer when this issue was raised directly with players who were told that it would not be tolerated			2
@entity15 was sent off for his challenge which provoked an aggressive reaction from @entity9 @entity9 captain @entity32 moved to defend his side 's actions during their clash against @entity10 the @entity1 will now look at heavier fines than the current sliding scale of costs from £ 20,000 - £ 500 or other options to address the worrying upward curve in harassing the match officials			1
referees could also start to be more proactive themselves by showing yellow cards to the players surrounding them , which is within their powers			0
ironically , considering that the @entity9 players ' distasteful conduct brought this issue to the fore , @entity88 do not have a similar charge in their rulebook			1
@entity9 captain @entity32 admitted after the @entity10 match that the willingness to surround referees ‘ does n’t look good ’			1
but @entity32 was adamant they would continue to do so if they believe opponents - such as @entity10 – are attempting to exert their own influence on the match officials			2
@entity32 said : ' for me , if i have to run 20 , 30 yards , it does n’t look great , but when you ’re standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref.			0
. for me , i think i support my team - mates			0
' and once i go , four or five go with me			0
it does n’t look good at all , but that ’s part of the game			0
