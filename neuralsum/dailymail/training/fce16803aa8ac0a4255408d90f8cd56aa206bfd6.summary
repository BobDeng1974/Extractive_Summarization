defence minister @entity9 , whose remarks were reported in the @entity11 daily , caused friction with the @entity3 only two months ago when he described secretary of state @entity14 's quest for @entity2 - @entity17 peace as messianic and obsessive			1
his latest comments , confirmed by an @entity2 official who was present at a lecture mr @entity9 delivered at @entity22 yesterday , displayed deep disappointment with @entity3 president @entity25 's handling of burning world issues			1
disappointed : @entity2 defense minister @entity9 said he could not rely on the @entity3 to help in confronting @entity7 over its controversial nuclear programme ' we had thought it would be the @entity3 that would lead the campaign against @entity7 , ' said @entity9 , who pointed to the @entity32 crisis as an example of @entity35 ' showing weakness '			1
he added : ' if your image is feebleness , it does n’t pay in the world			0
nobody will replace the @entity3 as global policeman			0
' i hope the @entity3 comes to its senses			2
if it does n’t , it will challenge the world order , and the @entity3 is the one that will suffer			1
' it was unclear from mr @entity9 's reported remarks where he believed the @entity3 , which on monday imposed sanctions on two top aides to president @entity50 and nine other people linked to @entity54 's @entity53 incursion , had gone wrong on @entity32			0

mr @entity9 pointed to the crisis as an example of @entity35 ' showing weakness ' against @entity54 attempting to make headway : @entity75 foreign policy chief @entity74 ( left ) and @entity7 foreign minister @entity76 wait for the start of closed - door nuclear talks in @entity59 on tuesday mr @entity9 said that although ' people know @entity7 cheats ' , the @entity3 and other nations chose to negotiate with @entity81 on restricting activities they fear are aimed at developing atomic arms			1
' therefore , on this matter , we have to behave as though we have nobody to look out for us but ourselves , ' @entity9 said , echoing prime minister @entity89 's veiled threats of unilateral military action against @entity7 if diplomacy fails			2
' unfortunately , when it comes to negotiating at a @entity94 bazaar , the @entity7 are better , ' said @entity9 , a former armed forces chief and a hawkish member of @entity89 's right - wing @entity97 party			0
in the @entity98 , @entity9 said , he had heard ' voices of disappointment ' over a lack of @entity3 support for @entity104 rebels in the three - year - old conflict in @entity106			0
attacked : mr @entity9 criticised president @entity25 's handling of world issues months after he described secretary of state @entity14 's quest for @entity2 - @entity17 peace as messianic and obsessive and on a recent visit in @entity114 , he added , he found ' disappointment about @entity116 getting stronger and the @entity3 getting weaker '			1
@entity89 , whose country is widely believed to be the @entity98 's only nuclear - armed nation , has denounced as a ' historic mistake ' an interim deal reached with @entity7 in november on curbing sensitive nuclear activities in return for limited sanctions relief			2
he has demanded that any final accord dismantle @entity81 's uranium enrichment centrifuges , a position at odds with @entity25 's suggestion that @entity7 , which says its nuclear programme is peaceful , could be allowed to enrich on a limited basis for civilian purposes			1
' @entity132 prefer to put off confrontation , if possible to next year or the next leadership term			0
but in the end , it will blow up , ' @entity9 said .			0
