by @entity0 an 11 - year - old boy who had a severely curved spine has gained six inches in height after an operation to insert magnets into his back			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with early onset scoliosis when doctors examined him after he fell off a trampoline in may 2011			1
the condition , which causes sufferers to have an s - shaped spine , can result in stunted growth and can cause respiratory problems			1
@entity7 ( pictured with his mother , @entity16 ) has grown 6ins after surgery to insert magnets into his spine @entity7 ’s father @entity21 , 54 , took his son to @entity23 shortly after the fall when he found a lump on his son ’s back			1
consultant paediatric spinal surgeon @entity28 told the schoolboy he would need invasive spinal correction surgery to straighten his spine			1
but while he was waiting for the operation , his mother @entity16 , 45 , discovered @entity34 ( @entity33 ) treatment when she was researching treatments on the internet			2
@entity34 works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into the patient ’s spine which can then be controlled by an external remote control			1
the rod is then lengthened by magnets outside the body which communicate with the magnets under his skin gradually straightening the spine			1
the family showed mr @entity28 the @entity34 rods and @entity7 underwent an operation to have them inserted into his spine at the @entity52 in @entity53 in july 2012			1
@entity7 has early onset scoliosis meaning his spine was s - shaped ( left )			1
surgeons inserted an adjustable magnetic growing rod into his back ( right ) and use it to gradually straighten his spine if this procedure had not been available , @entity7 would have faced much more invasive spinal surgery which would have involved his back being straightened using metal rods the rod in @entity7 's back contains magnets which can be controlled by external magnets			1
this allows doctors to adjust the rod without more surgery meaning they can extend his spine very gradually incredibly , the schoolboy was one of just 300 people in the world to have the rare surgery and one of the first patients in the @entity75			1
just six days after the five - hour operation @entity7 was back on his feet and recovering at his home in @entity79 , @entity80			1
he has now told how he has grown a remarkable six inches from 4ft 9ins to 5ft 3ins in the last 18 months			1
magnetic @entity33 treatment is a way of straightening a curved spine			1
it works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into a patients back			1
this can then be controlled using an external control - this avoids the need for further surgery			1
the internal rod is lengthened using the magnetic remote control outside the body			2
this means the spine can be very gradually straightened			2
usually , the child is required to return to hospital about every six weeks to have their spine straightened by a few more millimetres			2
this process continues until the child has reached their final height			0
he said : ‘ i think it ’s been much better for me and much better than a lot of people have had before			0
‘ it ’s great and amazing that they got the funding			0
‘ i felt really , really nervous and really traumatised about it when i was diagnosed			0
‘ i would never think anything that serious would happen to a boy like me			0
‘ but after the operation everything is just like it used to be before			0
‘ i have now managed to have a much more normal life			1
i just have to be a bit more cautious about what i do			0
’ his father , who runs a convenience store and post office in @entity122 with his wife @entity16 , added : ‘ it ’s changed his life massively			0
‘ it means there is n’t intrusive surgery every six months and he does not have the same scars			2
‘ it makes a massive difference			0
he ’s grown from 4ft 9ins to 5ft 3ins already since the operation			0
‘ it ’s taking away all that risk of being in operating theatres and being under anaesthetic and having all those procedures			0
‘ he was up and out of bed after two days and home after six , much quicker than the other kids			0
‘ the scars are much shorter			0
it makes a big difference			0
’ @entity7 ( pictured with his mother , @entity16 , and father , @entity21 ) was diagnosed with scoliosis after falling off a trampoline in may 2011			2
following the accident his father noticed a lump on his back and took him to hospital as @entity7 continues to grow , surgeons can continue to straighten his spine			1
image shows his surgeon using a magnet to adjust the rod in his back after the operation , @entity7 had to go back to hospital every six weeks for the magnets to be used to lengthen the rods inside his back			1
he will continue the process until he reaches his maximum height which he is expected to reach when he reaches his 20s			0
surgeon @entity28 said : ‘ the other treatments interfere with the growth and the patients never achieve normal growth			0
‘ you either have to open them up and have repeated surgery or have disproportionate growth			0
‘ without a doubt it ’s a really life - changing thing - it ’s pioneering			2
@entity7 said : ' after the operation everything is just like it used to be before			2
' he is pictured after his surgery @entity7 was able to walk two days after his operation and went home six days after surgery			2
he is pictured just weeks after the operation @entity7 will continue to have treatment until his 20s			2
he is pictured before his treatment started ‘ there ’s a rod which has a portion in the middle which has a rotating magnet			2
when you subject it to a strong magnet , that motorises things inside it and lengthens the whole rod			0
‘ you can bring the curve in line with the straight rods and correct the deformity			0
‘ as the child grows , every six weeks or two months you use the magnet to give them a few millimetres more , and you continue to do that until they reach their final height			0
‘ not many surgeons in the country , only about four or five , can do this technique			0
‘ @entity7 will have a normal life - and that ’s absolutely down to this treatment			1

@entity7 has early onset scoliosis meaning his spine is s - shaped
he was told he would need invasive surgery to straighten his spine
his *parents* then found out about @entity220 treatment
surgeons *agreed* to carry out the pioneering procedure in @entity53
in the last 18 months it has allowed him to grow 6ins and lead a normal life
it works by using external magnets to control a magnetic growing rod in his spine - this allows surgeons to straighten the spine gradually
