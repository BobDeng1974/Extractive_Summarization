by @entity0 centre stage : artist @entity2 is to appear alone in a gallery and will interact with visitors as part of a new show a top performance artist has banned visitors to her new show from bringing phones , cameras or computers in a bid to force people to live in the moment			1
@entity2 will be appearing on her own at @entity17 's @entity16 in @entity18 and intends to simply interact with those who come to see her			1
but the gallery has installed lockers in its foyer , in which visitors will have to leave their electronic devices before entering the room			1
@entity27 - born @entity2 , 68 , hopes the move will stop those who come to see her hiding behind their phone screens and taking photographs of things ' they do n't even experience ' at the time			1
she said : ' in these lockers they can put their blackberries and phones and camera and computers and watches			0
' we do n't want people to come here and phone and blog and tweet before they have even seen it , as they do all the time			2
' we want people to come as they are , with nothing , as i am			0
from then we will see what is going to happen			0
from that energy , every day is different			2
that is why it is so hard for me to explain to you what i am going to do , because i do n't know			0
' @entity2 , who collaborated with @entity57 on a video last year , will appear before an audience of up to 160 people for eight hours a day for her 64 - day exhibition , which opens on wednesday			1
in a sneak preview of the show yesterday , she took members of a preview audience and placed them in various locations in the white - walled gallery , leading them by the hand , whispering to them and giving instructions			2
launching the work , she said : ' there is nothing			0
just empty walls , there 's no more , and just me			2
' she went on : ' i think i push my limits here			0
i could n't do anything more radical than i am doing now - and i am terrified			0
' @entity2 will be aided by a team of 45 black - clad ' guards ' who will ensure her welfare and she says she may choose to use some props - including chairs , tables and mirrors - although much of each day will be spent on her feet			1
@entity2 , pictured explaining the new show yesterday , will force visitors to leave their phones and tablet computers at the door in a bid to get them to ' experience ' the present the @entity95 - based artist , who will wear a simple black and white outfit each day , will take no rests other than toilet breaks			1
she said she had some concerns about how a @entity100 audience will react to the wacky idea			0
she said : ' the @entity100 public is different			0
you 're cynical , you really like the bad jokes and you drink too much at the weekends , so i am very worried about your public - the only way that i can win here , the @entity100 public , is to be extremely vulnerable and humble , that i am there for you at this impossible moment			0
' her new exhibition is her first major performance work since she appeared at @entity95 's @entity113 in 2010 , with @entity114 , in which she sat in silence for three months with visitors invited to gaze into her eyes			1
as part of another exhibit last year , rapper @entity120 danced with her for six hours while performing his song @entity123 at the @entity124 in @entity95			2
the @entity16 in @entity17 will have 160 lockers in its foyer so visitors can leave their electronic devices			1

*eccentric* @entity2 will appear alone at @entity17 's @entity16
she will interact with visitors for eight hours a day aided only by a few props
but those who go to show will have to leave *gadgets* in a locker outside
@entity2 says the move will force visitors to ' experience things at the time '
