@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we learned from the @entity4 and @entity5 this week , including why @entity6 is the set - piece master			1
click here to follow @ ralphellis56 1 ) everybody remembers @entity6 for the ' @entity10 ' last minute goal against @entity11 , and his equally dramatic equaliser that sunk @entity13 in the 2006 @entity14			2
those type of stunning strikes from open play are becoming a thing of the past , however			0
his coolly taken spot kick against @entity20 at @entity21 meant that only one of his last 18 goals for @entity24 have not been either free kicks or penalties			1
the odd one out was last season 's header from a @entity30 corner that kicked off the 4 - 0 win over @entity32 at @entity33			1
the @entity48 midfielder was the man playing peacemaker at @entity50 , dragging @entity51 away from trouble after he had riled @entity32 's defenders by gloating about @entity55 's own goal			1
@entity42 certainly needed to sort out his behaviour			2
he collected a red card plus 13 yellows in each of his last two seasons			0
new role : @entity42 has become the peacemaker at @entity62 this season 3 ) @entity35 's pace will be vital for @entity37 alongside 35 - year - old @entity34 – especially with another veteran in @entity65 as @entity67 's alternative defensive option			1
@entity35 , trying to recover the form that brought him an @entity71 cap in 2012 , was one of only two central defenders in saturday 's @entity4 games to register a top sprinting speed of 20mph or more as he helped @entity37 register their first clean sheet of the season			1
@entity77 : @entity35 was one of only two @entity4 defenders to get above 20mph this weekend 4 ) @entity80 teenager @entity79 is already getting a reputation as a danger man – and he has n't made his full @entity4 debut yet			1
@entity84 were so worried about the 18 - year - old 's tricky dribbling ability when he came on as a late sub they had @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 all booked for crunching tackles on him in the space of five minutes			1
danger man already : @entity84 players were quick to foul @entity80 youngster @entity79 on sunday 5 ) @entity96 is struggling to handle the defensive side of his new role as a wingback – and the extra workload is leaving him too puffed out for his attacking play too			1
the 29 - year - old got forward often enough to put in 12 crosses at @entity104 , but not a single one of them was accurate enough to create a goalscoring chance			0
@entity107 and @entity106 were @entity109 's top two players for the number of sprints they made , but @entity106 also failed to set up a single opportunity			1
hard work : @entity96 is struggling in defence for @entity109 , and is too worn out to attack 6 ) @entity117 is in @entity119 's under 21 squad this week , but could be the next graduate of the @entity122 academy to force his way through to senior @entity71 honours			1
the teenager bossed the midfield at @entity13 , setting up one goal and making five more chances for team mates before he was subbed with 19 minutes left			0
he also had two attempts on goal of his own , and found a team mate with 44 out of 49 passes			0
@entity71 call up ? @entity117 could be the next @entity122 graduate to hear from @entity134 7 ) @entity135 took over a club in chaos when he walked into @entity138 last summer , so it is hardly surprising that stability is one of his watch words now			1
@entity135 has kept the same line - up for all the first five of @entity138 ' championship games so far , and a comfortable 3 - 1 win over @entity147 proved the policy is paying benefits			0
solidity : @entity135 has kept the same @entity138 line - up for all five championship games ... and it 's working 8 ) @entity152 has found it tough to be accepted by @entity155 fans since his move from @entity157 , and manager @entity158 has been forced to defend him against critics on a number of occasions			2
@entity162 he 30 - year - old made things worse for himself by waving at @entity165 supporters who cheered him when he got brought on as a 77th minute sub in the 1 - 0 defeat			2
@entity152 , of course , was a big hit at @entity171 scoring 85 goals in 152 games between 2006 and 2010			2
looking for a return ? @entity152 waved at @entity165 fans after they cheered the @entity155 striker off 9 ) any other @entity178 club might have been stung by selling their 26 - goal top scorer just days before the transfer deadline – but @entity181 look capable of surviving the loss of @entity183 to @entity184			0
after signing 34 - year - old @entity186 , boss @entity185 has even been able to keep @entity187 , who got 23 last season , on the bench			0
@entity190 , as he likes to call himself , is likely to get his chance now			0
the 23 - year - old former @entity193 trainee came on as a late sub before slotting a cool last minute penalty to earn a 2 - 1 win at @entity197			0
main man : @entity187 could step up for @entity181 after @entity183 left for @entity184 10 ) @entity199 was the manager who took @entity200 from the bottom of the @entity202 all the way into the @entity5 – only to get sacked 18 months ago the first time he suffered a few bad results			0
the 42 - year - old @entity206 is proving his worth again in his new job as boss of @entity209 – following the midweek @entity211 giant - killing at @entity4 @entity157 with a 2 - 0 win over @entity213 that put his unbeaten side fourth in the table			0
@entity199 made only one change from the side that won at the @entity218 – and that forced on him by @entity221 's hamstring injury – but made sure that nobody still had their minds on the @entity211 success .			2

only one of @entity6 's last 18 @entity24 goals have n't been set pieces
@entity42 was calming @entity62 players down against @entity32 on saturday
@entity35 one of two centre backs who made it above 20mph this weekend
@entity79 *impressive* for @entity80 against @entity84 on sunday
@entity117 could be next @entity122 star to get @entity71 call up
