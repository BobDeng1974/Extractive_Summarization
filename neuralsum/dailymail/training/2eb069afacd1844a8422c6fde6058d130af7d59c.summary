' there will be 220,000 fewer international seats and 34,000 fewer domestic seats , ' he said			0

' ' compared to january 2012 , january 2013 will see a 3 % increase in global capacity , which equates to about 8.5 million seats , or an extra 24,000 seats per day , ' he said			2

' @entity124 continues to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world , with carriers such as @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 reaffirming the position of the @entity124 as a transit point for traffic around the world			2
' @entity137 capacity will be greater than in recent years			0
this is thanks to traffic to and from @entity140 , but domestically it remains rather soft			0
' the available capacity in @entity53 will be slightly down in january 2013 compared to january 2012			2
