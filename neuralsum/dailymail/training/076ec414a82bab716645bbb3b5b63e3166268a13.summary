by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 8 october 2013 employees who work through lunch appear less tired at the end of the day if they had the freedom to choose how they spent their break			1
according to a new study , socialising over lunch may not be the best way to unwind during the day if it 's with the wrong crowd			1
those who spent their lunch mingling with co-workers , or if the boss was around , felt less relaxed at lunch and more tired at the end of the day			1
working through lunch may not be so bad , especially when employees choose to do so without pressure this is because conversations may be about work , and employees may be more careful about what they say and the impression they make with their colleagues , according to @entity25 , an associate professor and co-author of the study			2
researchers at the @entity30 's @entity29 concluded working through lunch may not be so bad , especially when employees choose to do so without pressure			1
' we found that a critical element was having the freedom to choose whether to do it or not , ' said @entity25 , an associate professor and co-author of the study			0
' the autonomy aspect helps to offset what we had traditionally thought was not a good way to spend break time			0
' researchers asked employees what they had done during their lunch breaks over 10 days			0
they then followed up with the participants ' co-workers to report how tired their colleagues appeared by the end of each workday			0
the authors found that while working through lunch did result in employees appearing more tired , the effect was reduced when employees felt it was their decision			1
the study revealed that socialising also led to higher levels of fatigue , which researchers attribute to whether or not workers feel free to decide if they want to socialise and who they 're socialising with			2
relaxing activities during lunch , freely chosen by workers , led to the least amount of reported fatigue at the end of the day			2
@entity25 said while many might assume lunchtime socializing is a good way for employees to relax , that 's not necessarily the case if they mingle with other employees in the company cafeteria or if the boss is around			2
in those instances , @entity25 said conversations may be about work , and employees may be more careful about what they say and the impression they make with their colleagues			0
' you 're hanging out with people who you ca n't necessarily kick back and be yourself with , ' @entity25 said			0
workers may not relax if they mingle with other employees in the company cafeteria or if the boss is around regardless of how it is achieved , researchers believe organisations that do n't provide opportunities for their workers to recover from work during the day risk lower employee effectiveness and productivity , leading to burnout , absenteeism and higher staff turnover			1
the study , co-authored by @entity101 student @entity100 , and professors @entity103 of @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 of the @entity108 , is scheduled to be published in the @entity109 .			0

@entity101 's @entity29 studied workers
found they felt more tired if forced to work through lunch
felt less relaxed if socialising while boss is around
@entity118 , and allowing workers to recover , is *key*
