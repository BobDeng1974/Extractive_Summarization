by @entity0 the rate of @entity3 infections diagnosed in the @entity4 each year fell by one - third over the past decade - hopeful news that the @entity7 epidemic may be slowing in @entity4			1
sixteen out of every 100,000 people ages 13 and older were newly diagnosed with @entity3 in 2011 , a steady decline from 24 out of 100,000 people in 2002 , a study released online saturday by the @entity12 found			1
the reasons for the drop are n't clear			1
it might mean fewer new infections are occurring or that most infected people already have been diagnosed so more testing wo n't necessarily find many more cases			1
' it could be we are approaching something of a " ceiling effect , " ' said one study leader , @entity24 of @entity25			2
decline : the rate of @entity3 infections diagnosed in the @entity4 each year fell by one - third over the past decade - hopeful news that the @entity7 epidemic may be slowing in @entity4 the research is part of the journal 's special report on hiv research , issued ahead of the @entity31 that starts sunday in @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity3 is the virus that causes @entity7 , which destroys the immune system			1
the @entity35 estimates 35 million people globally have the virus			0
in the @entity4 , 1.1 million people are thought to be infected , though many do n't know it			1
the study is based on @entity3 diagnoses from all 50 states ' health departments , which get test results from doctors ' office , clinics , hospitals and laboratories			1
the data span a decade , making this a larger and longer look at these trends than any previous study , said another study author , @entity56 of the federal @entity57			0
declines were seen in the rates for men , women , whites , blacks , @entity64 , heterosexuals , injection drug users and most age groups			0
the only group in which diagnoses increased was young gay and bisexual men , the study found			2
the diagnosis rate is a direct measure of when people actually tested positive for the virus			0
the diagnoses may be identifying infections that happened recently or years before			0
@entity3 : former @entity4 president @entity78 visited an orphanage with @entity3 - infected kids in the outskirts of @entity82 on july 18 , 2014			1
rates of infection of @entity3 in the @entity4 have dropped int he past decade the study found diagnosis rates dropped even as the amount of testing rose			1
in 2006 , the @entity57 recommended routine hiv testing for all @entity4 ages 13 to 64 , saying an hiv test should be as common as a cholesterol check			1
the percentage of adults ever tested for @entity3 increased from 37 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2010 , according to @entity57 data			2
@entity56 acknowledged that given the testing increases , the new findings may seem like a bit of a paradox			0
one might assume that ' if more people get tested , you 're more likely to find more people who are infected , ' she said			2
but several factors could explain the decline			0
one is @entity107 's ' ceiling effect ' theory			0
another is a possible ebb in new infections			0
the @entity57 has been estimating about 50,000 new infections occur each year and that number has been holding steady in the past decade			2
that estimate comes from reports from 25 city and state health departments , joined with statistical modeling			0
@entity56 said maybe new infections are waning			0
or maybe not , she and other experts said			0
how could new infections be holding steady when diagnoses are falling ? perhaps the infection count might be buoyed by the expanding epidemic in young gay and bisexual men , said @entity124 , the @entity125 researcher .			2

16 out of every 100,000 people ages 13 and older were newly diagnosed with @entity3 in 2011 , a steady decline from 24 out of 100,000 people in 2002
the results came from a study released online saturday by the @entity12 found
the reasons for the drop are n't clear but could mean fewer new infections are occurring or that most infected people already have been diagnosed
