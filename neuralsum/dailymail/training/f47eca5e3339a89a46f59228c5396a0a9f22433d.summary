yesterday , the @entity49 released an interim report stating that 1,700 veterans at a @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , were systematically placed on secret waiting lists where they languished while waiting to see @entity57 doctors			0
more than 40 veterans on the secret waiting lists died , according to a former doctor at the hospital			0
after looking into the retired physician 's claims , the @entity49 found that staff at the hospital claimed veterans were seeing doctors in a timely manner , when in reality many waited an average of 115 days for their first appointment			0

a plethora of lawmakers have called on the president to either fire va secretary @entity90 or for @entity90 to resign on his own accord			0
the former secretary of state and the president may also have discussed the president 's decision to draw down forces in @entity97			2

@entity110 have a strong chance of reclaiming the @entity112 from the president 's political party and making @entity0 a lame duck president during his final years in office			2

in the infamous ' 3 am call ' ad , @entity13 's campaign asked who voters wanted answering the phone in the middle of the night when trouble came knocking at @entity98 's door			0
