by @entity0 last updated at 1:38 pm on 18th august 2011 gunman @entity1 had a second larger bomb that was ready to be deployed at his farm , a @entity5 tv channel has reported @entity5 gunman @entity1 had prepared a second bomb that was bigger than the one which detonated in @entity10 killing eight people			1
public broadcaster @entity12 reported yesterday that military sources had discovered a 3,300lb device at his farm around 85 miles north of the city			2
by comparison , the bomb which went off in the capital weighted 2,095lbs according to estimates			0
despite the claims , the @entity5 police denied that they had found any device			1
using @entity26 , spokesman @entity25 said : ' a lot of modified fertiliser was found at the farm ' however that is just one of many bomb components			2
important elements were missing and it still needed a lot of work before that became a bomb able to be deployed			0
' the reports of the second bomb came as a judge denied a request by the extremsist to wear formal tailcoat for his appearance on friday			1
judge @entity46 called the suggestion ' disturbing ' as he also closed the court for @entity1 's appearance			1
he said : ' in light of the extreme seriousness of the case , such an attire could be disturbing , insulting and provocative			0
' speaking after the refusal , @entity1 's lawyer @entity54 explained that the killer had wanted to wear the coat as he wanted to show his respect for the judicial process			1
but judge @entity46 stressed that ' ordinary , proper clothing is enough to show that he takes the judicial process seriously			0
' friday 's hearing will determine if @entity64 will remain in solitary confinement after the first four - week period has passed			1
devastation : the bomb that killed eight in @entity10 weighed 2,095lbs experts have estimated , with the reports the device at @entity1 's farm weighed more than 3,000lbs the gunman claimed on tuesday that he called police in the middle of his bloody rampage to surrender after phoning police and telling them ' mission accomplished '			1
the 32 - year - old - who eventually murdered 69 people - spoke to a control worker			0
the call ended - inexplicably , though @entity1 claims he was ignored - and he was left expecting a call back			1
however , officers could n't get in touch with him again , it is claimed			0
he went on to kill another 20 people on the island of @entity90 after attempting to hand himself in			2
far - right extremist @entity1 was apparently promised a call back after getting a ' garbled ' response			1
reconstruction : the 32 - year - old , in a bulletproof vest , pretends to hold a gun as @entity5 officers recreate what happened as @entity1 went on the rampage by the time officers did try and ring him back the phone was switched off , the @entity101 reported			1
he apparently told them : ' @entity106 accomplished and i will surrender to the @entity108			0
' the rampage went on for two - hours in total as @entity1 killed 69 and injured dozens more after a bomb had been detonated in the centre of @entity10 which killed another eight people			1
he was eventually arrested after he had made a second call to officers			0
on the police log of the call it said : ' a @entity5 - speaking man says that he will surrender to police '			2
he first got through to the control room at 17.58 before ringing again at 18.26 shortly before he was arrested following his rampage on july 22			0
although he got through to police twice , @entity1 has told police that he tried to ring at least ten times			2
a swat team go onto the island as they try and stop the gunman during the bloody attack on july 22 horror : 69 people were killed on @entity90 after a bomb went off in the centre of @entity10 however , the phone network was overwhelmed as hundreds of relatives of those on the island bombarded police with emergency calls			0
@entity1 faces up to 21 years in prison if he is convicted on terrorism charges , but an alternative custody arrangement — if he is still considered a danger to the public — could keep him behind bars indefinitely			0
his lawyer has said he has admitted to the terror attacks , but denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save @entity5 and @entity146 from @entity147 and punish politicians who have embraced multiculturalism			0
initial speculation suggested others were involved in the terror attacks , but prosecutors and police have said they are fairly certain that @entity1 planned and committed them on his own .			2
