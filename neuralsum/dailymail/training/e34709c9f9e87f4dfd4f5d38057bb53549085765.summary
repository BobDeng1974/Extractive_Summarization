the rare cloud , known as a @entity11 , appeared over the @entity12 , in the @entity14 area of @entity2 on monday , flecked with colour and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky			1
social media users flocked to the web to speculate what the cloud was , with some claiming that it was a ' rapture ' cloud			1
some weird rainbow / cloud action going on in @entity12 right now '			2
another asked , ' what 's going on over @entity43 ? ' according to @entity45 , the holes can be caused by a phenomena called ' seeding ' , when planes fly though clouds causing ice particles to freeze in the air as it flows around the aircraft			1
@entity29 was with his family on @entity31 when they spotted the unusual cloud formation in the sky			1
' we just looked up and there was this thing that looked like something out of @entity61 , ' he told @entity62			0
the it consultant from @entity64 said that they stood staring at the sky for a while , trying to figure out what it was			0
' other people spotted it as well , and most of the theories as to what caused it had to do with an aircraft or helicopter , definitely man made , ' he said			2
' one of my friends did say in jest that it was the rapture			0
it definitely looked out of place in the sky			0
' ' i guess now we 're all just waiting for the mothership to come			0
' mr @entity29 said that he often saw unusual weather patterns as he grew up in northern @entity2 , but that this was one of the more bizarre			1
' it was a perfectly sunny day , and quite warm , so it just seemed to come out of nowhere , ' he said			0
@entity90 from the @entity92 's duty forecaster , said that the cloud could also be called a punch hole cloud			2
' they form when the water temperature in the cloud is below freezing , but the water has not yet frozen due to a lack of ice nucleation particles , ' mr @entity90 told @entity102			1
' in this case , when the water does start to freeze , it falls down to the surface ... so you 're left with this cloud surrounding it , this clear area			2
' the fallstreak hole is seen in the skies above @entity12 in southeastern @entity112 by dairy farmer @entity113 , 47 , on sunday			0
on the right the rare cloud formation is seen with a rainbow streak running through it the flecks of colour were called iridescence , and can also be found in other natural objects such as sea shells , soap bubbles and even butterfly wings			1
' this type of [ cloud ] iridescence occurs with high level cloud and with diffraction , [ meaning ] that water droplets are gathering light , ' mr @entity90 said			2
there have been other recent sightings of fallstreak hole clouds , with one forming over @entity134 in early october			0

' so the @ @entity145 wants you to believe what happened over the skies of @entity149 yesterday was a " cloud formation " ? @entity152 # @entity151 , ' tweeted one user			1
