by @entity0 a 151 - year - old house that was the first in the world to be lit using hydroelectricity is once again harnessing the power of water to light the property			1
@entity8 , in @entity9 , was built by @entity10 in 1863 and he used lakes on the estate to generate electricity through a turbine			1
a 56ft ( 17 - metre ) @entity17 screw has now been installed which will use water to produce enough energy to light the 350 bulbs in the house			1
stunning property : @entity8 , in @entity9 , was built by @entity10 in 1863 and he used lakes on the estate to generate electricity through a turbine hydroelectricity : a 56ft @entity17 screw has now been installed which will use water to produce enough energy to light the 350 bulbs in the house imposing : the grade 1 listed building reopened in 2007 after a total refurbishment and is surrounded by one of @entity35 's largest rock gardens lights up : @entity8 curator @entity37 checks the lightbulbs in the library of the @entity41 home @entity43 actor @entity42 today turned on the screw at the @entity46 property and launched the hydropower project			1
property curator @entity37 said : ‘ it is a very visual demonstration of the way hydro power works , an almost sculptural sight in the landscape			0
‘ lord @entity10 was an exceptional man with an ingenious mind and the prospect of bringing his vision for @entity8 into the 21st century is a dream come true			1
‘ @entity57 is the world 's most widely used form of renewable energy , so we are looking forward to sharing this very special part of its heritage			0
’ historic : @entity9 property @entity8 was the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity launched : @entity43 actor @entity42 ( left ) today turned on the screw at the @entity46 property bulbs : water from @entity74 , the lowest of five on the @entity8 estate , will feed through the turbine and into the burn below historic : the original hydropower cylinders on the grounds which lord @entity10 used to power the estate water from @entity74 , the lowest of five on the @entity8 estate , will feed through the turbine and into the burn below			1
' lord @entity10 was an exceptional man with an ingenious mind ' @entity37 , property curator as water passes through the spiral blades it causes the screw to turn , thereby harnessing the energy of falling water			1
the energy is then converted into electricity using a generator			2
@entity94 , head of conservation for @entity96 and the @entity97 at the @entity46 , said : ‘ the hydro - turbine is a great example of the innovative methods we are using to achieve the highest possible standards of sustainability			2
let there be light : as water passes through the spiral blades it causes the screw to turn , thereby harnessing the energy of falling water proud moment : @entity43 actor @entity42 ( left ) with @entity8 property curator @entity37 ( right ) dating back : the original hydropower cylinders on the @entity9 estate 's grounds from @entity41 times portrait : lord @entity10 became a civil and mechanical engineer and started on @entity8 aged 53 , before developing hydroelectricity there in 1878 ‘ the technology is easy to maintain due to the simple mechanics , and because it works at low speed , it 's possible for fish to pass through the turbine unharmed			1
' the technology is easy to maintain due to the simple mechanics ' @entity94 , @entity46 ‘ the best thing about the screw is that it 's visible and we hope this will add to people 's understanding of why @entity8 is so special			2
' visitors will be able to view the technology from the lake side			0
’ the grade 1 listed building reopened in 2007 after a total refurbishment and is surrounded by one of @entity35 's largest rock gardens			0
inventor : a portrait of lord @entity10 on the wall above a light at @entity8 once described as a ' a palace of the modern magician ' , @entity8 was the first building in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity			1
the estate , which has more an 30 miles of footpaths and lakeside walks , features gadgets well ahead of its time such as fire alarm buttons , telephones , a passenger lift and a @entity157 bath suite			0
it is also home to one of @entity35 's largest rock gardens , and features one of the oldest iron bridges of its type in @entity165			0
in fact , its 140 - year - old @entity167 pine tree has been verified as @entity165 ’s tallest tree – measuring 131ft ( 40m )			0
the property was created in 1863 by inventor and landscaper lord @entity172 , his wife @entity173 , and their architect @entity174			2
lord @entity10 became a solicitor after leaving school , but had always had an interest in mechanics - and often took apart toys as a child to find out how they worked			2
he became a civil and mechanical engineer and started on @entity8 aged 53 , before developing hydroelectricity there in 1878			0
light bulbs were installed there in 1880 and visitors travelled for miles to see how he had turned the power of water into electric light			1
lord @entity10 was also an armaments magnate , and effectively became chief gun manufacturer to the @entity194 after being knighted in 1859			0
he was behind the accurate and practical @entity195 , a breech - loader which re-equipped the @entity194 after the @entity197			0

@entity8 dates back 151 years - it was built by @entity10 in 1863
he used lakes on the estate to generate electricity through a turbine
56ft @entity17 screw has been installed at @entity9 property
it will use water to produce enough energy to light 350 bulbs in house
