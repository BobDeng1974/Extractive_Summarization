@entity0 admitted his £ 11m signing @entity2 is still some way short of full match fitness after @entity5 slumped to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity7 on saturday			1
@entity2 , who joined from @entity8 at the start of july , was anonymous as @entity0 's side were well beaten on their return to the second tier after 13 years in the @entity13			1
‘ @entity2 came with a lack of fitness , he was not at the beginning of pre-season , ’ said @entity0 afterwards			2
‘ he is not in the right shape at the moment but he will be the perfect striker for us			0
’ the @entity21 international is likely to be consigned to the bench until he catches up , offering an opportunity for 17 - year - old tyro @entity25 to make a name for himself			1
@entity5 were at their most dangerous at @entity27 after @entity25 was introduced from the bench with 20 minutes to play and he is sure to feature prominently this season			1
but who is this teenage talent ? here 's our lowdown			0
talent : @entity25 made a superb cameo appearance during @entity5 's 2 - 1 defeat against @entity7 why all the fuss ? quite simply , @entity25 catches the eye with every performance , whether it be for @entity5 's first team , their youth team or @entity42			1
stationed on the right against @entity7 , for example , he tested their back line again and again with his speed , skill and confidence to take on defenders			2
entering the game when @entity5 were two goals down , he added much - needed energy and impetus and they very nearly snatched a point from the game			1
where does he play ? @entity25 can either play wide on the right , where he regularly cuts inside the left - back to shoot at goal or cross , or behind an out - and - out forward			1
he is adept at finding pockets of space around the box and troubles central defenders with his direct runs at them			0
leading man : @entity25 inspired the @entity5 under 18s to the @entity69 final last season what ’s his background ? @entity25 hails from @entity72 and joined @entity5 ’s academy at the age of 13			1
from the @entity75 , he quickly advanced through the ranks and was soon a regular in the @entity67			0
in 2012 - 2013 , he scored nine goals in 24 appearances at this standard and last season he got 14 in 27			2
@entity25 has just enjoyed a phenomenal breakthrough season			1
he inspired @entity5 to the final of the @entity69 , the furthest the club have ever progressed in the competition			1
the teenager scored a hat - trick against @entity87 in the fourth round , a vital equaliser at @entity90 in the semi-final and a memorable goal in the second leg of the final with @entity95			2
it took a miraculous comeback , in which @entity95 scored three times in the final 13 minutes , to beat @entity5 7 - 6 on aggregate and deny @entity25 a winners ’ medal			1
after just a handful of under 21 appearances , @entity25 was fast - tracked to the first team and was named in the squad for the match with @entity107 on march 15 before coming off the bench to make his debut at @entity110 a week later			2
@entity0 describes him as an ‘ incredible talent ’ and clearly felt he was ready for top flight football			0
with wholesale changes at the @entity115 over the summer , more first - team opportunities await in the second tier			0
the young winger has scored six goals in 11 matches for the @entity75 17s what about international honours ? @entity25 made his @entity123 under 16 debut in september 2012 and has been a regular ever since			2
he has scored six goals in 11 matches for the @entity126 and won a @entity129 winners ’ medal back in may			0
at the finals in @entity131 , he scored a hat - trick against @entity133 in the group stage and a brilliant individual goal against @entity136 in the semi-final , before playing a full part in the final against @entity140			0
what are his strengths ? aside from the aforementioned speed and trickery to take on defenders , @entity25 has a good eye for goal , a neat first touch and excellent control with the ball at his feet			0
weaknesses ? @entity25 may have to bulk up a little to cope with the physical challenge of playing at the top level , but that will come as he gets older			0
what happens now ? @entity25 signed a contract shortly after his 17th birthday that ties him to @entity5 until 2016 but as his profile grows , there is bound to be interest from @entity13 clubs			1
he has been earmarked as one of the brightest @entity165 talents of his generation and hopefully he will continue to progress and achieve his potential			0
three @entity168 : @entity25 won a @entity129 winners ’ medal in may after beating @entity140 on penalties			0
