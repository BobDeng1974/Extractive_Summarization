by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the moment a huge bengal tiger made off with a woman 's handbag after she accidentally dropped it into his enclosure at a @entity9 zoo			2
@entity10 was using her shiny brown patent leather bag to try and get the big cat 's attention at @entity14 when it slipped from her grasp and ended up in a pool of water inside the animal 's pen			1
aware that all her money , credit cards and keys were in the bag , ms @entity10 initially planned to wait until it was safe and then reach over and grab it			1
but the tiger had different ideas - taking such a shine to the accessory that he swam the length of the water to pick it up , before carrying the bag back to a difficult - to - access island in the middle of his enclosure and parading around with it in his mouth			1
fortunately staff at @entity14 were understanding about the situation and gave ms @entity10 and her family a free pass to spend the rest of the day at the attraction while they worked hard to distract the tiger for long enough to recover the handbag and all the essential items it was carrying			2
' we waited until the tiger was being fed in another part of the enclosure and a member of staff retrieved the bag			0
it was a bit chewed and soggy but it was all there , ' said @entity14 's manager @entity60			0
images of the tiger stealing the handbag have swept across @entity9 social media , with ms @entity10 saying : ' my children and everyone else thought it was hilarious and even i had to see the funny side in the end			0

woman had been using her shiny brown patent leather bag to *encourage* the large tiger to come towards her
but she lost grip of her accessory , dropping it into the enclosure along with all of her money , credit cards and keys
having initially planned to reach over and retrieve the bag , the tiger had other ideas and grabbed it for himself
@entity168 swam the length of the enclosure to retrieve the handbag , before taking it back to a difficult - to - access island
staff at @entity14 eventually distracted the animal with food while they *climbed* in to reclaim badly chewed bag
