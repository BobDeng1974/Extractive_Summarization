as an aid to literacy , generations of pre-teen youngsters followed the everyday adventures of @entity5 and @entity6 , the carefree stars of the @entity8			1
thirty - six of the books were issued as part of the publisher ’s @entity12 between 1964 and 1967 and remained in print , selling 80 million copies worldwide , with the illustrations undergoing an occasional redesign			2
today , the @entity5 and @entity6 books are a valuable piece of @entity21 social history , and a side - by - side comparison compiled by a grown - up fan of the books has underlined just how much life changed during the years they continued to engage young minds in countless homes and schools throughout @entity21			1
where once the brother and sister — like their equally popular middle - class contemporaries @entity35 — could be seen doing all the things a boy and girl might be expected to do in the @entity39 , health ’ n ’ safety , sexual and racial discrimination and political correctness intervened to shepherd them into a very different world			0
@entity46 , who started a ladybirdflyawayhome.com website dedicated to old @entity48 , posted ‘ then and now ’ photos on @entity50 @ @entity51 and invited followers to guess the respective dates			0
but the pictures instantly became a fascinating chronicle of the subtle lifestyle changes that @entity5 and @entity6 underwent in the years following their first appearance			1
‘ i was brought up reading the 1964 books and i loved them because they were very idyllic , ’ said @entity46 , a 50 - year - old teacher from @entity58			2
‘ i was less keen on the later books because they were too much like real life			0
’ peaceful waters : in the @entity39 drawing , @entity5 paddles a rubber dinghy without a care while @entity69 , the family 's @entity70 setter , splashes happily along beside him			0
by the @entity72 , mop - haired @entity5 must wear a brightly coloured life jacket all change : @entity5 , @entity6 and their friend keeps a tight rein on the docile @entity69 as smartly dressed @entity78 gallantly helps his equally immaculate wife off the train , holding her handbag as he does so			1
in the @entity72 , @entity82 forges ahead while @entity78 , still lumbered with the bag , follows meekly behind playing a straight bat : @entity5 stands poised at the crease while @entity6 , as befitting a soppy girl , bowls timidly underarm			1
by the @entity72 , it 's @entity6 who 's wielding the willow , thwacking a ball clear to the boundary over her brother 's flailing fingers child 's play : @entity6 , demure in a dress and sensible shoes , looks at the dolls in a @entity39 toy shop			2
a decade later , the tomboyish , jean wearing @entity101 attention is caught by a go - kart while the selection of toys for sale includes @entity107 brush and a @entity108 , reflecting the all - pervading influence of children 's television sunset over suburbia : the @entity39 view from @entity5 and @entity6 's bedroom window was of unspoilt greenery			1
by the @entity72 , a housing estate of semi-detached ' des res ' properties had sprung up , while beyond them a tower block loom ominously that 's the ticket : the @entity39 children make friends on a train ride to the country			0
by the culturally diverse seventies , it 's a young black friend who is sharing his apples with them			0
the trilby - wearing gent in green seems to have strayed in from the fifties though			0
perhaps he thought he was catching the @entity136 everything in the garden 's lovely : @entity5 helps @entity78 tend to the dahlias while @entity6 and @entity140 read quietly			1
by the @entity72 , @entity78 's lazing in the chair with @entity82 hard at work in the borders			0
he only gets up to stop @entity5 and @entity6 squabbling about a book			2
there 's probably a transistor radio blaring somewhere too running free near the water ( left ) but an adult is later added to indicate the children were supervised ( right ) seatbelts have been added in the picture , right , but safety was n't such a big issue in the earlier version @entity156 , @entity5 and @entity6 chat to the train driver in the story where @entity78 helped @entity140 disembark from the train but in a later version the duo are stopped from running onto the platform ( right ) the children were helped onto the bus in early editions by a bus conductor but catch it themselves a few years later in a new bus with no - one to help them on it a shopkeeper weighs the sweets for the children ( left ) but he was later removed and the children helped themselves as the number of supermarkets increased @entity6 helpfully holds the tent for @entity5 ( left ) but they both get stuck in later ( right ) @entity6 is wearing a dress and pushing a pram ( left ) but is seen wearing jeans and rollerskating by the 1970s you have to look carefully , but the dog is now on a lead in the later version on the right in the 1960s @entity78 watches @entity140 wrap the present , by the 1970s he was joining in @entity186 changes : in the 1960s ( left ) the children ran into the road to get an ice cream but a pavement was later added to reflect improved safety expectations			1
