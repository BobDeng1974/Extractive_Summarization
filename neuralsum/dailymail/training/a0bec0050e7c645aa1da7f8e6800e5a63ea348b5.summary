more than 1.5million @entity9 users in @entity10 attacked ' smears ' linking her to doping , while her father also attacked the ' arrogant ' @entity14 over the insinuations			1
the storm raging around her did little to harm the form of the 16 - year - old – nicknamed the ' @entity20 ' – as she stormed to victory in the 200m individual medley at the @entity23 in a time of 2mins 7.05secs			2
after last night 's race , miss @entity2 faced a barrage of questions about alleged drugs use			1
speaking in her native language , she said at a press conference : ' of course i think this is a little bit unfair for me			2
however , i was not affected by that			2
' she added : ' i think that in other countries , other swimmers have won multiple golds and no one ever criticised them			2
how come people will criticise me just because i have won multiple medals ? ' she denied ever using performance - enhancing drugs , saying : ' absolutely not			2
' the teenager said she had trained for five hours a day for nine years			2
@entity4 organisers warned that if there were drug cheats at @entity28 ' they will be caught ' , while @entity10 team officials point out miss @entity2 had been repeatedly tested and never failed			1
@entity2 built a strong lead over @entity69 's @entity68 in the final length @entity2 is congratulated by @entity71 ( left ) of the @entity43 , @entity68 ( top ) of @entity69 and @entity73 ( right ) of @entity74 cool and calm : the double gold medal winner waves to fans after she leaves the pool miss @entity2 's father , @entity78 , hit back at the ' biased ' reaction to his daughter 's win , stressing the @entity10 swimming team had gone through an especially rigorous anti-doping regime			1
he attributed her victory to a combination of hard work and guidance from @entity10 coaches , adding : ' the @entity14 media has always been arrogant , and suspicious of @entity10 people			0
' criticism of the teenager have been met by a storm of protest in @entity10 , where @entity96 platforms – @entity10 's @entity9 equivalents – were inundated with messages defending miss @entity2 and accusing critics of being ' jealous ' , ' sour grapes ' and ' shameful bias '			1
' @entity102 , do n't join the @entity4 if you ca n't afford losing , ' wrote one user in @entity106			0
some suggested it was a conspiracy by @entity109 , the @entity43 and @entity110 to damage the standing of the @entity10 team , which currently tops the medal table			0
others said miss @entity2 's swim was the product of effort and training			1
@entity119 , the head of anti-doping work at @entity10 's @entity122 , dismissed the slurs , insisting : ' it is not proper to single @entity10 swimmers out once they produce good results ... some people are just biased			0
' the @entity10 athletes , including the swimmers , have undergone nearly 100 drug tests since they arrived [ in @entity131 ]			0
' many were also tested by the international federations and the @entity109 anti-doping agency			0
i can tell you that so far there was not a single positive case			0
' describing miss @entity2 as a ' superwoman ' , the respected @entity43 @entity139 , executive director of the @entity140 , triggered the controversy by casting doubt on her performances , suggesting they were reminiscent of swimmers at previous @entity4 who had subsequently been caught for using performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity148 , @entity131 's @entity4 chief , urged caution			0
podium : @entity2 poses with her gold medal , flanked by silver medalist ( left ) @entity69 's @entity68 and bronze medalist ( right ) @entity43 swimmer @entity71 ' it 's very difficult to make judgments , ' he said			1
' it was an outstanding performance			0
i tend to believe ... it 's very unfair to judge an athlete by a sudden breakthrough			0
' there was support too from @entity164 , @entity166 deputy mayor , and a gold medallist in the men 's 100m breaststroke in the @entity170			1
he stressed competitors were innocent until proven guilty and that there were always ' incredible improvements ' in performance at large sporting events			0
former olympic gold medallist @entity176 took to @entity9 to express his concern , writing : ' forgive personal reference , but my @entity179 [ @entity180 ] 17 yrs old and never been doubted			1
if my nationality was different ? ? point : if i can , anyone can			0
' @entity184 communications director @entity183 said yesterday : ' we have a very strong drugs testing programme			0
and we 're very confident that if there are cheats then we will catch them			0
' miss @entity2 's extraordinary swim came in the 400m individual medley , in which she managed the last 50m of the freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds 27 - year - old @entity193 managed in the men 's event minutes earlier			1
her victory comes after a day of fierce debate about the legitimacy of her win at the weekend , when she smashed the world record on route to gold in the 400m individual medley			1

@entity2 wins second gold of @entity28
@entity207 unlikely to defuse controversy about her *dramatic* performances
