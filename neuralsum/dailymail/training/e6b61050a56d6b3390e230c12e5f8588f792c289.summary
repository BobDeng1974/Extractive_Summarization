by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:08 pm on 28th june 2011 the crew of the @entity3 was forced to evacuate today after a fast - approaching piece of space junk was detected			1
the six astronauts sought refuge in two @entity9 soyuz spacecraft until the debris had passed at 12.08pm gmt. radar - tracking had identified the space junk as it hurtled towards the @entity3 - it ended up passing within around 820ft			1
safety measure : the six astronauts aboard the @entity3 were forced to evacuate today after a fast - approaching piece of space junk was detected once the all - clear was given , the crew returned to their duties			1
safety procedures are initiated should an unidentified object be heading in the direction of the @entity3 astronauts are instructed to head to the docked spacecraft in case a quick getaway is needed			1
station commander @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 took shelter aboard the @entity31 docked to the @entity33 module			1
since the first object , @entity36 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			1
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			2
it is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity51 's orbit			2
@entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 sheltered aboard the @entity56 spacecraft docked to the @entity58 module			1
a @entity60 report warned last year that there is so much junk whizzing around @entity51 that any collision in space could cause a knock - on effect that would destroy vital communications satellites			0
earlier this year the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and @entity68 announced a plan to solve the problem by sweeping up damaged satellites and space shuttles			0
they will attach the thin metal net , which is several miles wide , to a satellite and then launch the pair into space			0
once in orbit , the net will be released at which point it will start picking up space junk in its path during a journey that is expected to last several weeks			0
high - tech litter : an artist 's impression of space junk in low - @entity51 orbit the net will become charged with electricity causing magnetic fields to pulled to @entity51			0
both the net and its contents will burn up as they enter @entity51 's atmosphere			0
the possibility of a satellite crashing into a hunk of space debris has worried scientists for years			2
one collision could send thousands of pieces of debris spinning out , potentially destroying other satellites			2
television signals , weather forecasts , global - positioning navigation and international phone connections are just some of the services at risk			0
the uncontrolled chain reaction could make some orbits unusable for both commercial or military satellites , according to the @entity115 sent to @entity116 in march 2010 .			0
