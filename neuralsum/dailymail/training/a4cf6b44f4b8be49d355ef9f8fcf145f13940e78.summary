inspector @entity43 said : ‘ this bit of kit is fantastic			0
it attaches to the dog ’s head and we can get a live view of what they are seeing			1
‘ if we are searching for a dangerous person we can send the dog into a building to search for them , and when they indicate a find by barking we will be able to see exactly what or who they have found			2
