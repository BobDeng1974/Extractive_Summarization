@entity0 has been cleared to play in the @entity1 after an @entity3 panel kicked out a charge of deliberate handball during sunday ’s semi-final against @entity7			1
in the aftermath of the @entity11 ’ 3 - 2 extra-time win , the @entity8 admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been sent off by referee @entity13 for stopping @entity15 ’ net - bound effort on his goal - line			1
in an unprecedented move , the @entity18 defender was subsequently cited by @entity20 , the @entity3 compliance officer , for denying an opposing team an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball			1
@entity18 defender @entity0 will be allowed to appear in @entity1 final after his ban was dismissed @entity0 was not sent off and no penalty was given as @entity18 went on to beat @entity7 3 - 2 after extra-time that move created a furore - with @entity30 , @entity31 vice-president and head of the refereeing committee , warning that penalising @entity0 retrospectively would open up a can of worms for the game			1
but a three - man judicial panel dismissed the charge - leaving the player free to face @entity38 at @entity39 on may 30			1
@entity0 tweeted : ‘ once again , would like to thank everybody for the messages and support given over the last few days			1
back to business now , can not wait ! ’ ‘ i have seen the support from various clubs ’ fans and i ’m very thankful			2
i can look forward to the final now , and get ready for saturday ! ’ @entity18 chairman @entity48 also released a statement expressing the club ’ s relief that @entity0 would now be central to the biggest game in their history			1
‘ the club is delighted for @entity0 that the @entity55 dismissed the complaint brought against him , ’ he stated			1
‘ @entity0 will now be available for selection for the @entity1 on 30th may 2015 v @entity38			1
‘ the result means that the club can now fully appreciate the achievement of reaching its first ever @entity60 and focus on preparations for saturday ’s game versus @entity63			2
‘ on a personal note , both @entity0 and i would like to express our gratitude to our legal team from @entity69 led by partner @entity70 who worked tirelessly to ensure a favourable outcome			1
’ @entity73 boss @entity72 revealed , however , that the furore over the @entity0 affair had made him consider quitting his job in disgust at @entity79 football			2
speaking before the verdict was announced , he said : ‘ it ’s taken the shine off our victory			0
so much so that i ’m even looking at myself			0
‘ if this is what goes on in @entity87 football , i do n’t know if i want to be a part of it			0
i ’m serious when i say that			0
‘ i ’m really , really disillusioned with it and over the last two days i have just switched off my phone			0
‘ i think the whole of @entity95 football knows there is a real injustice here			0
it ’s unprecedented and so many people have something to say on it			0
‘ i ’m a little bit embarrassed			0
i think @entity87 football is being dragged through the mud a little bit			0
‘ i think there ’s a wee bit more to it than what we are seeing			0
there has been plenty happening since i came up here , going back to semi-final kick - off times , playing @entity112 ( in a semi-final ) at @entity114 in the middle of @entity116 , i just think sometimes @entity18 get treated with contempt			1
’ the @entity0 affair was the latest recent high - profile case to have been brought by @entity120 that has subsequently been dismissed			1
@entity122 striker @entity121 has twice successfully defended himself against retrospective charges brought following games against @entity18 and @entity7			1
earlier this month , @entity126 keeper @entity125 escaped an extension to the two - game ban – with one game suspended – that he received after breaking rules on gambling			1
@entity20 said that the @entity133 ban , issued by an independent panel , was ‘ unduly lenient ’ but another independent tribunal upheld the original decision			1
meanwhile , @entity63 ’s @entity137 lost his appeal against the red card he received against @entity122 last weekend			2
the veteran midfielder will now sit out two matches			0
' i think there 's a wee bit more to it than what we are seeing			0
there has been plenty happening since i came up here , going back to semi-final kick - off times , playing @entity112 ( in semi-final ) at @entity114 in the middle of @entity116 , i just think sometimes @entity18 get treated with contempt			1
' @entity155 chief executive @entity154 had warned the @entity3 that it was creating a dangerous precedent by citing @entity0			2
speaking shortly before the outcome , the former @entity126 and @entity159 defender said : ' i think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country , players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely have n't been seen by the referee			2
maybe a punch behind the referee 's back and fly kick when the ball is away			0
' but we think , if the rule has been extended , then it is now erring into re-refereeing into a game on a monday			2
' that 's not the purpose of video evidence			0
that 's why the @entity182 and @entity31 and @entity183 steer away from that			0
the referee could see the incident on sunday , he just did n't see the handball			2
' i feel for the referees because their performance is now being analysed to the nth degree and i do n't think that 's fair on them			0

@entity18 defender @entity0 has won appeal against one - match ban
the 22 - year - old was offered one - game suspension following incident
however , an independent judicial panel tribunal *overturned* decision
@entity18 reached the @entity1 final with 3 - 2 win over @entity7
