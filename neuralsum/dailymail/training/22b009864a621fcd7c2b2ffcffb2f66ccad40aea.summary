@entity0 has revealed why he stripped off his shirt after scoring just two minutes into @entity3 's draw with @entity4 on saturday afternoon			1
the @entity6 striker was showing his support for the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) by tattooing the names of 50 hungry people helped by the charity onto his body			1
the @entity8 has helped 805 million hungry people all around the world and the 50 chosen by @entity0 symbolically represented some of the worst humanitarian crises ongoing today			1
' but there are names no one cares to remember			0
that no one cheers for : the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world today			0
' i have the supporters all over the world			0
from now on i want this support to go to the people who suffer from hunger , they are the real champions			0
' so whenever you hear my name , you will think of their names			0
' @entity0 had the temporary tattoos - of names such as @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 - applied to his torso ahead of the @entity4 match			2
@entity0 removed his shirt to reveal the 50 names after scoring after just 72 seconds of the match when he scored in the second minute - extending a leg to direct @entity74 's cross into the bottom corner - he removed his shirt in the middle of the field to show off the tapestry of tattoos			1
@entity0 received a yellow card for his troubles , as the rules dictate , but was n't overly concerned having got his message across to the world			2
' each one of the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world has a name , a voice , a story to share , ' said @entity8 director for @entity94 @entity93			2
' @entity0 accepted the challenge and wished to carry their stories on his own skin so that the world does not forget them			0
' his goal represented the perfect start to the afternoon for the @entity103 side but it ended in a nightmare for @entity105 and his team			0
@entity8 @entity0 wore most of the tattoos on his arm , chest and midriff the striker was booked for removing his shirt in celebration , as the laws of the game dictate @entity0 turns to celebrate after seeing his shot hit the back of the net in only the second minute although @entity120 doubled their lead shortly before half - time , they suffered four injuries and ended the match with just nine - men after two players went off after the final substitution had been made			1
@entity128 , @entity129 , @entity74 and @entity130 are definitely out of @entity3 's @entity131 last 16 , first leg tie with @entity133 on tuesday night , while @entity134 is rated 50 - 50			2
and , to add insult to injury , @entity4 fought back in the final few minutes to claim a 2 - 2 draw and stop @entity3 going top of the table .			1
