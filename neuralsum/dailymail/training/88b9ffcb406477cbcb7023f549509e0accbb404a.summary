by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 11:02 est , 9 august 2012 a multi-millionaire who spent £ 40,000 on a ' @entity3 ' climbing frame for his children in the grounds of his country mansion has been ordered to move it - and says the work will cost up to £ 50,000			1
father - of - five @entity9 , a 44 - year - old director whose @entity12 - based @entity11 investment firm which has been valued at £ 30 million , owns historic @entity13 in @entity14 , a @entity16 * listed manor house set in 350 acres of landscaped grounds			1
he built the huge adventure playground for his children three years ago and says he was never told he needed planning approval			1
not happy : @entity9 next to the £ 40,000 climbing frame outside his home in @entity13 which he has to move as @entity22 thinks it 's ' bulk and visually unsympathetic ' now he ’s been ordered by @entity22 to rip it down , with planning officers saying he should have applied for consent and it is ' bulky and visually unsympathetic ' and must be shifted			1
mr @entity9 has been forced to apply to the council for permission to dismantle it and move it almost 100 feet to the other side of his driveway - work he says will cost £ 50,000			1
he said : ' when we bought the climbing frame , we were told it did n’t need planning permission			1
you ca n’t see it from the road and if you had enough strong men you could lift it up , so i was surprised when a planning consultant said we needed permission			1
' the playground , which includes a timber play house , climbing frame and slide , is nearly 35 feet long and more than 13 feet high , with three chutes , two slides , bridges and swings			2
he said : ' i ’ve got five small children from nine months old to seven years and we can see them playing from the window			1
sometimes with their friends , there can be 50 children on there and moving it further from the house will make it less safe			2
' by the time i ’ve paid for planning consultants and everything , it could have cost me £ 50,000 to get the job done			2
on the move : the playground , which includes a timber play house , climbing frame and slide , is nearly 35 feet long and more than 13 feet high , with three chutes , two slides , bridges and swings but has to be relocated ' i ’d much rather have been told where to put it in the first place and given the money to charity			2
it ’s not fixed to anything and we ’re just very disappointed			0
' ' there ’s no animosity towards the council but i ’m very disappointed about the whole thing			0
there ’s been some suggestions that we ’ve done this deliberately , but that ’s not the case			0
' we ’re going to have to change the drive , put some gates up , and change the flow of traffic , because our main concern is to protect the safety of the children , and where it ’s going to is a less safe environment			0
' the revised planning application has been agreed by council officers using delegated powers			0
@entity108 and @entity110 clerk @entity109 said : ' my council supports the revised application and considers it a more suitable site , which would not impact upon the listed building			0
' @entity115 , historic buildings inspector for @entity117 , said : ' we previously expressed serious concerns about the positioning of a large children ’s play area to the east of the @entity16 * - listed @entity13 , but do not wish to object to this revised proposal to re-site it			0
' a @entity127 council spokesman said : ' a structure of this size so close to a @entity16 and inside a @entity16 historic park , requires planning permission because it dominates its surroundings			2
' we have been taking enforcement action to have it moved			0
we are pleased the owner has now obtained planning permission to move the climbing frame to a location that is more in keeping with the historic landscape at @entity13			0
