by @entity0 rising levels of carbon dioxide in @entity4 's atmosphere has been blamed for increasing temperatures , but elevated levels of @entity7 could also be damaging our crops			1
a field study of wheat has shown that its nutritional value decreases when it is exposed to higher levels of the greenhouse gas			2
the issue is caused when plants turn nitrate into @entity17 do this to stay healthy , but @entity7 inhibits their ability to perform the process			1
rising levels of carbon dioxide could make crops like wheat less nutritious , claims a new study this means their nutritional value drops as they struggle to stay alive			1
in the study professor @entity28 of the @entity29 at the @entity30 and his colleagues exposed wheat to varying levels of @entity7			1
they showed that under elevated levels of @entity7 , as compared to regular levels , the level of nitrate assimilation was slowed			1
protein and nitrogen concentrations decline in plants under elevated levels of @entity7			1
this decline could be caused by the plant growing larger with more co2 , diluting the protein in their tissues			2
carbohydrates could also accumulate on the leaves , decreasing the amount of a prevalent protein called @entity52			0
elevated co2 also inhibits plant nitrogen metabolism			2
all in all , increased @entity7 reduces the amount of protein in crops			1
this makes them less nutritious for humans			0
‘ these findings imply that food quality will suffer under the @entity7 levels anticipated during this century unless more sophisticated approaches to nitrogen fertilisation are employed , ’ they write			1
the food quality of field - grown plants has already begun to decline , but until now no plausible theory had been put forward to explain why it ’s happening			1
this research is the first to point the finger at co2 as the cause of this decline			0
the study examined samples of wheat from 1996 and 1997 in the @entity78 near @entity79 , @entity80			0
during that period air enriched with @entity7 had been released on the fields , similar to what is expected to be present in the air by 2030			0
alongside this a controlled planting of wheat in ambient air was also grown			0
@entity89 material from the plots was then iced , dried and stored in vacuum - sealed containers			0
this allowed professor @entity28 and his team to study the plants and make their findings with methods that were not available when the experiment was first performed over a decade ago			0
nitrogen fertilisation ( pictured ) has been touted as a possible solution , but it can harm the environment other studies have shown that protein concentrations in wheat , rice , barley and potato tubers decline by about eight per cent on average under increased levels of @entity7			1
the expected rise in the co2 in the next few decades will in turn drop the protein content available to humans by about three per cent			2
while small , it is an effect that could snowball if left to get out of control			0
one possible solution is nitrogen fertilisation to sustain nitrate levels in the plants			0
however , this would have an adverse effect of leaking nitrate into groundwater and increasing emissions of nitrous oxide , another greenhouse gas			0
a new method of fertilisation might instead need to be devised in order to counteract the effects of rising @entity7 .			2

new research studied the effects of increased co2 on field crops
*scientists* from @entity30 found it slowed plant processes
this meant the plant was unable to turn as much nitrate into protein
*ultimately* , this will make crops less nutritious for humans
' food quality will suffer under the @entity7 levels anticipated during this century , ' say the researchers .
