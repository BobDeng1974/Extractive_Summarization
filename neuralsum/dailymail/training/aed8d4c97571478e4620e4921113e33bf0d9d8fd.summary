by @entity0 @entity1 has launched a scathing attack on @entity5 morning show @entity3 after cutting off an interview over questions about her niece @entity9			1
the reality tv star 's appearance on the show was cut short on tuesday morning and @entity3 quickly tweeted that it was due to host @entity14 's line of questioning			1
' we thought it was a technical glitch but turns out @ @entity19 's people pulled the plug after @ @entity21 asked about @entity22 , ' @entity3 tweeted			1
' why would i cut an interview short because of @entity34 ? get over yourself @entity3 ... the call dropped ... stop reaching for a story , ' she tweeted			2
' you are so f * * * ing desperate ! ' the 29 - year - old later tweeted ' sorry @entity40 took my phone ' , referencing her outspoken alter - ego			0
@entity3 executive producer @entity43 told the @entity45 's people did pull the plug on the interview and said her local rep had apologised			1
he also tweeted : ' what happened with @ khloekardashian on the show is a good lesson for publicists everywhere			2
do n't try to censor natural conversation			0
' sunrise host @entity55 fired back and called @entity1 an ' idiot ' later in the program			1
' [ my daughter ] @entity61 's going to be very angry with me criticising @entity1 , but she 's an idiot , ' he said			1
' i 'm sorry … i 'm sorry to do that			0
' awkward : tuesday morning 's @entity3 interview with the reality star was cut off @entity55 and co-host @entity14 also went on air after @entity1 sent the tweets to deny her claims the call was dropped due to a bad satellite			1
' our information from @entity73 was that the plug was pulled when we talked about @entity22 , ' @entity70 said			2
' we were not given any information that that was off limits , you are launching a babies ' clothing line which you yourself admitted was inspired by your nieces and nephews			0
' earlier in the show @entity1 appeared live from @entity73 to talk about the @entity85 's new lingerie and baby clothing lines			1
@entity70 asked the reality star about her niece , @entity88 and @entity90 's daughter @entity9			1
' and i guess the baby line is inspired by nieces and nephews starting to arrive , how 's baby @entity34 going ? ' @entity70 asked			2
' @entity34 is fabulous she 's so beautiful , ' @entity1 responded			1
' @entity96 's obsessed with her and it 's so cute to see that cousin dynamic			0
' the live feed was immediately cut off following @entity1 's response			1
happy birthday : @entity1 posted a picture collage to @entity103 thanking @entity104 for ' being the best brother anyone could ask for ' perhaps @entity1 is just shaky with international radio hosts , as she had another clunky moment later in the day			2
during an interview with @entity111 's @entity110 she abruptly stopped talking ; the hosts thought she had cut out , but she was just embarrassed after swearing , thinking cussing was taboo			2
after a few awkward moments of silence , she mustered up an apology , before the confused funnymen delicately assured her all was well			0
later on tuesday @entity1 tried to change the subject after her @entity121 tirade by posting about brother @entity104 's birthday			1
she posted a picture from @entity103 to her @entity121 account and also said that she was celebrating with @entity125 in @entity73			0
' birthday dinner and game night ! ! ! @entity129 # @entity128 , ' she wrote			0
also on tuesday @entity137 did an interview with @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 on @entity136 , during which she opened up about her divorce to @entity139			0
' it 's definitely not anything i ’m through			0
i ’m going through it , but i ’m not through it , ' she said			0
' it 's really hard to watch yourself on tv too – it 's definitely different in that the world has to watch too			0
' it 's definitely not the easiest thing to do but it 's my life now i guess			0

@entity1 's pr team pulled plug on live chat following questions about her niece
reality star initially denied interview was killed ... but her rep later apologised
@entity5 morning show host @entity55 later branded her an ' idiot '
