some three - quarters - of - a - million migrants struggle to speak a word of @entity3 and are taking no steps to learn , shocking new figures have revealed			1
despite ministers in successive government pledging strict language tests as part of the immigration system , around 700,000 foreigners living here would fail to hold a cursory conversation			1
the startling total was exposed in a think - tank report which said learning the @entity3 language was ‘ vitally important to the integration of migrants who wished to build a successful future in the @entity19 ’			1
academics said migrants who were ‘ non-proficient ’ in @entity3 were being ‘ left voiceless ’			1
critics said the findings risked making a mockery of repeated government promises that any foreigner wanting to live here must be able to speak the language			0
the report follows a recent survey by the @entity31 which revealed more than half of migrants who have failed to learn @entity3 do not have jobs – so are more likely to rely on benefits			1
the new statistics were revealed by @entity49 , a left - leaning think - tank , in a study published today			2
the report said there was a ‘ widening gap ’ between the 850,000 migrants who at the last census in 2011 said they could not speak @entity3 well or at all and the 150,000 currently registered in classes to learn – known as @entity3 for @entity58 ( @entity59 )			1
of those who struggled to speak @entity3 , 37 per cent were from south @entity61 , including @entity62 and @entity63 , and 17 per cent were from @entity64			1
demos said the @entity59 system was ‘ under strain ’ because the number of working - age foreigners aged 16 to 64 who lived in @entity19 had risen from 3million in 1993 to 6million in 2012 – fuelled by @entity70 ’s flawed policy of opening the country ’ s doors to mass immigration			2
but it criticised the @entity76 for reducing funding for @entity59 classes by 40 per cent – from £ 212million in 2008 - 09 to £ 128million in 2012 - 13			0
the @entity59 classes at further education colleges , community colleges or through independent organisations			0
@entity83 , the author of the report , said : ‘ it is essential that we get as many newcomers as possible using @entity3 with confidence			2
this will unlock migrants ' potential and benefit the whole country			0
‘ unfortunately , our current @entity59 system is not up to the task			0
current policy suffers from fragmentation , lack of clarity about the aims and intended outcomes of learning , and the tendency to take a short - term view			0
’ introduce a ‘ national strategy ’ on teaching @entity3 to migrants would ‘ make it easier for migrants to access public services and interact in the community ’ , said @entity49			1
the report into the number of people who can not speak @entity3 comes after the @entity112 was rocked by two immigration scandals			1
in may , the @entity114 revealed migrants who can not speak @entity3 were able to buy a certificate saying they had passed a language test			1
the document opened the door to @entity19 citizenship , allowing them access to a full range of benefits			0
scandal : migrants who spoke no @entity3 were able to pay £ 500 for a certificate saying they passed our investigation exposed @entity132 , which ran the scam at exam centres licensed by the @entity112			1
during our undercover probe , the @entity114 paid £ 500 for a pass certificate in the @entity3 language exam for a fake candidate despite him never sitting the test or taking a course			2
and a month later red - faced ministers admitted the staggering scale of abuse of the student visa system by immigrants desperate to stay in @entity19			0
tens of thousands of bogus students faked @entity3 language tests to beat @entity19 border controls , the government admitted			2
an estimated 48,000 immigrants had exploited the lax system in a ' shocking ' scam run by criminal gangs , said immigration minister @entity155			0
he revealed there had been ' systematic cheating ' that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of @entity3 to stay in the country illegally , with corrupt invigilators reading out answers or allowing gangs of imposters to sit tests so the candidates could be awarded an @entity3 language certificate			1
in december last year , @entity168 announced all migrants would have to demonstrate a ‘ reasonable standard of @entity3 ’ or be barred from claiming benefits			2
the @entity172 said tests applied to those who end up claiming any work - related welfare payments would be tightened			0
for the first time , migrants are to be quizzed about their language skills to determine whether these are likely to prove a barrier to them finding jobs			0
a government spokesman said : ‘ funding for @entity3 language training is targeted at people whose lack of @entity3 is preventing them from finding work or isolating them from their community			2
‘ we have toughened up @entity3 language requirements for residency and citizenship but we do not subsidise learning for people seeking to meet these			0
‘ it is right that employers and individuals in work contribute towards the cost of their @entity3 language learning and so we do not fund workplace training .			0

@entity212 said those who are *n't* proficient in @entity3 are left ' voiceless '
