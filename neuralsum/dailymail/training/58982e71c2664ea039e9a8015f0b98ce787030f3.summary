by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 4 may 2013 for years the @entity2 hotel in the @entity4 resort of @entity5 offered guests the chance to enjoy a little tipple under the @entity10 sun. men and women could mingle over a @entity13 at the rooftop pool bar or enjoy a pint downstairs in the @entity17 ' pub '			1
but last weekend , to cheers of ' @entity20 is great ' , the owners poured the entire contents of their drinks cabinet down the the drain and declared @entity26 the resort 's first official alcohol - free hotel			1
alcohol free : the owners of @entity2 hotel in the @entity10 resort of @entity5 are hoping to attract more conservative @entity32 guests and in a bid to further woo an increasingly important conservative @entity32 clientele , they have created men - only floors and made the rooftop pool a women - only area patrolled by female security officers			1
while most mainstream @entity43 scholars also agree that @entity43 forbids alcohol consumption , the changes appear to have garnered a mixed response			2
last orders : the hotel owners pour bottles of booze down the drain ' excellent step ! ' read one tweet			1
' the signs of the revolution are starting to appear in @entity4 ' , read another			0
however other observers were less impressed - ' a hotel without liquor ? definitely a silly achievement for the president , ' posted one indignant observer			1
the decision reflects deeper changes in @entity4 following the 2011 uprising and the fall of @entity65			0
under president @entity68 's @entity32 brotherhood alcohol restrictions have been tightened , segregated areas are springing up and citizens must declare the religion on their state id cards			2
but tourism , for years the mainstay of the @entity4 economy , appears to be suffering , with the number of western visitors falling			0
around 14.5 million people visited @entity4 in 2010 , accounting for 10 percent of economic activity and earning the country $ 12.5 billion			0
but visitors numbers fell to around 9.8 million the following year , reflecting political turmoil at the time , and have yet to recover to anywhere close to pre-revolution levels			0
one @entity5 hotel owner reported numbers down by as much as 50 per cent			1
the decision to go alcohol free can be seen as a move to attract more tourists from conservative middle - eastern states , who do not feel comfortable around boozy westerners			1
hotel manager @entity93 told the @entity94 : ' at the moment many @entity96 men wo n't come to @entity5 because they wo n't get the privacy they require			1
' we 're trying to fill that gap in the market			0
' industry : @entity104 , for years the mainstay of the @entity4 economy , appears to be suffering following @entity4 's 2011 uprising in march the @entity4 government doubled beer tax to 200 per cent and increased wine tax from 100 per cent to 150 per cent			0
alcohol was also banned from airport duty - free shops			1
that followed the announcement of plans in february to ban the sale of alcohol in certain areas outside @entity116 and to stop renewing alcohol licences			2
' the previous regime would not have allowed this kind of hotel , because such a hotel would n't have reflected the image that @entity65 would have wanted for @entity4 , ' @entity118 owner @entity93 added			0
ringing the changes : under @entity4 's president @entity68 's @entity126 restrictions are being tightened and taxes on booze have been raised while the hotel has even gone so far as to remove pictures of western singers @entity133 and @entity134 from the walls , a few things appear to have slipped the net			0
the website still boasts a poolside bar and an @entity17 ' pup ' ( @entity140 ) and pornographic movies are still available on the pay - per - view tv system			0
but as @entity4 continues to become more conservative it 's almost certain other hotels with be following @entity26			2

@entity26 is first official alcohol - free hotel in @entity10 resort of @entity5
cheers of ' @entity20 is great ' as owners tip contents of drinks cabinet down drain
rooftop pool now for women only *enforced* by female security patrols
