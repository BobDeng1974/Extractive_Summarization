@entity0 is quite a mouthful			1
which is why locals refer to this region of lakes , castles , and beaches in the @entity8 - east of @entity9 as @entity0 , or @entity10			1
the @entity11 refers to @entity12 , now mostly in @entity13			0
it has a long coastline on the @entity16 and is the third largest of @entity9 's @entity17 - but the least populated			1
so you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage , except in your lunch			0
back in focus : ' @entity10 ' offers blissful beaches along @entity9 's @entity16 coastline after @entity27 , @entity10 was part of communist @entity9 , which might account for its low profile			1
the regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside , so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated			1
since reunification 25 years ago , all that has changed			1
the result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully - run resorts			1
the sea accounts for the region 's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 - were part of the 13th - century trading confederation , the @entity52 , which did business with @entity54 and @entity55 around the @entity16			1
two of the cities , @entity46 and @entity48 , are @entity58			0
towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red - brick , moulded and baked from the sodden clay			1

on the road , go - kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests			2
a day 's fishing off a boat costs € 39 ( £ 27 ) , including lunch from a stewpot			2
at the beach resorts of @entity86 and @entity87 , holidaymakers on hire bikes ( £ 6.50 a day ) pedal through pine - filled parks to the sea - front			1
a steam train called @entity91 plies a coastal route to @entity93 , location of the five - star @entity95			2
it has a sanatorium , a @entity100 chef , a castle ( for weddings ) and a children 's house with games			2
quietly charming : the pretty @entity107 square in @entity48 sums up the region 's appeal @entity10 is a refuge in peace and war			0
forewarned of the @entity118 bombing , citizens of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 fled here			0
' the castles were full of refugees , ' says @entity121 , proprietor of 16th - century @entity122 , which his ancestor @entity123 built among the inland lakes			0
@entity126 , born in 1949 , bought back his burnt - out family home and turned it into a 40 - room hotel			0
at sunset , cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks , for a moment , like an intricate , interweaving mv - formation			0
