by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 with monday ’s transfer deadline fast approaching , there is still plenty of talent on offer for @entity9 clubs			0
@entity10 runs the rule over the best players still available on the market			0
@entity14 club : @entity16 : 32 position : goalkeeper why might he move ? @entity19 has made @entity21 his new first - choice keeper , why would someone of @entity14 ’s calibre accept sitting on the bench ? who wants him ? @entity26 and @entity27 are keen			1
@entity16 are expecting an approach in the coming days , but @entity14 will have to make clear he wants out			1
who wants him ? @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
@entity35 has no intention of leaving for @entity45 , but would seriously consider a move to either north @entity49 club			1
surplus : @entity51 international @entity35 ( left ) has been told he can leave @entity52 @entity53 club : @entity37 : 25 position : midfielder why might he move ? the @entity51 international does not feature in @entity59 ’s plans and must move before monday ’s deadline			1
who wants him ? @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity65 has already had an £ 8million offer accepted so it ’s now up to the player			0
clever business : @entity52 midfielder @entity53 is close to an @entity40 exit @entity71 club : @entity73 : 26 position : midfielder why might he move ? because moves to the top flight do not come around all that often , so when it does arrive you have to grasp it			2
who wants him ? @entity83 have had a £ 7million bid accepted and @entity85 are keen , but @entity86 have also thrown their hat into the ring			0
moving up : @entity73 midfielder @entity71 has been linked with a move to the @entity9 @entity90 club : @entity92 : 28 position : striker why might he move ? just a season into his stay , @entity27 are prepared to let him depart and the striker is also up for leaving			1
who wants him ? @entity98 have met with his representatives over a move to @entity101 , but the £ 20million loan fee is a stumbling block			2
@entity43 could also show late interest			1
big money : @entity27 are demanding a £ 20million loan fee for @entity107 striker @entity90 @entity108 club : @entity110 : 22 position : midfielder why might he move ? he is viewed as one of the best emerging midfield talents in @entity115 and has a £ 37million release clause			1
if a club is willing to pay , he will go			0
who wants him ? @entity52 and @entity43 are set to battle it out for the midfielder			2
it ’s a big call for @entity108			0
hot property : sporting @entity123 youngster @entity108 ( right ) is one of @entity115 's brightest prospects @entity126 club : @entity128 : 27 position : midfielder why might he move ? @entity52 are set to make a late charge for the @entity132			2
@entity128 are n’t in a rush to sell but if @entity52 come up with the money then he could go			0
who wants him ? @entity52 are the club furthest advanced in their interest so if he leaves , it ’s likely to be to @entity40			2
video : scroll down @entity142 : @entity126 happy to stay at @entity128 welcome to @entity143 ? @entity132 midfielder @entity126 ( right ) is closing in on a move to @entity40 @entity145 club : @entity147 : 25 position : midfielder why might he move ? @entity44 need to balance the books after spending heavily and the @entity152 midfielder has found himself on the sidelines with new manager @entity154 preferring @entity155 and @entity156			1
who wants him ? serie a club @entity159 have pursued @entity145 all summer but they can no longer offer him @entity161 football after losing in qualification			2
out of favour : @entity152 midfielder @entity145 has been on the sidelines under new manager @entity154 @entity165 club : @entity167 : 23 position : forward why might he move ? the purchase of @entity171 has pushed him further down the @entity173 pecking order and he got a taste for first - team football during last season ’s loan spell at @entity178			1
who wants him ? @entity180 liked what he saw last season and has been pushing for a permanent deal all summer			0
however , reports in @entity185 say @entity186 are keen			0
wanted : @entity167 forward @entity165 ( left ) has slipped down the @entity173 pecking order			0

@entity16 keeper @entity14 could still seek the @entity190 exit
@entity35 has been told by @entity41 that he can leave
@entity43 could show a late interest in a loan move for @entity90
@entity145 could be *offloaded* as @entity44 balance their books
