women who go up one dress size every ten years are a third more likely to develop breast cancer , @entity4 research shows			1
experts say there is a strong link between the amount of fat stored around the waist and the risk of tumours developing			1
the study by @entity15 academics also found that women who go up two dress sizes in a decade are 77 per cent more likely to develop the illness			1
a study found women who gain a dress size every ten years are a third more likely to have breast cancer for some time researchers have known that being overweight increases the risk of breast cancer			1
they say that fat tissue releases the hormone oestrogen , which triggers the development of tumours			1
now this latest study has shown that gaining weight around the stomach – rather than on the upper arms , thighs or bottom for example – appeared to be particularly harmful			1
the @entity15 researchers think that this type of fat produces more oestrogen than that stored elsewhere on the body			0
they said that after further checks , their findings could present ‘ a clear and simple message ’ for women that even gaining a modest amount of weight greatly increases the risk of cancer			2
around one in eight women will develop breast cancer and there are 50,500 new cases in the @entity4 every year			1
the study , published in journal @entity56 , looked at the records of 93,000 women in their 50s and 60s who had all been through the menopause			0
this study has shown that gaining weight around the stomach appeared to be particularly harmful each had to complete a detailed form about their lifestyles , which included questions on height , weight , smoking and drinking habits , current dress size , and what it was when they were 25			1
researchers tracked them for two years and recorded how many had developed breast cancer			0
they found that going up a dress size was the single most important lifestyle aspect in determining whether a woman got breast cancer			2
calculations showed that going up one dress size every ten years between the ages of 25 and 65 increased the risk by 33 per cent and going up two dress sizes in a single decade raised it by 77 per cent			2
on average women were a size 12 when they were 25 , but by the time they were in their 50s or 60s had gone up to between a 14 and 16			0
only 25 per cent stayed the same or became slimmer between their 20s and 50s or 60s			0
the researchers say that if women dropped a dress size in ten years , their chances of breast cancer would go down by 33 per cent			2
however , experts said the research was unreliable because it depended on women ’s memories and dress sizes remaining the same across the decades			0
@entity105 , of @entity106 , said : ‘ evidence tells us the most important things you can do to reduce breast cancer risk , especially after the menopause , is to keep a healthy weight , be physically active as often as you can and cut down on alcohol			0
’ but @entity115 , of @entity116 said : ‘ this study highlights an easy way to monitor your weight gain over time			0
