by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 4 april 2013 while we are often told of the benefits of ' coming clean ' , refusing to apologise can actually make people feel better than those who say sorry , according to a new study			1
scientists have found that the feelings of empowerment that come with refusing to make amends for a mistake can outweigh feelings of relief experienced when saying sorry			1
researchers @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , from the @entity16 , surveyed 228 @entity17 and asked them to remember a time they had done something wrong			1
refusing to apologise can actually make people feel better than those who say sorry , according to a new study while most people remembered relatively trivial offenses , some remembered serious offences , including crimes such as theft , @entity23 reports			2
the team then asked the subjects whether they had said sorry , or made a decision not to apologise even though they knew they were in the wrong			0
scientists have found that the feelings of empowerment that come with refusing to make amends for a mistake , can outweigh feelings of relief that come with saying sorry they also split the group at random - instructing some to write an email where they apologised for their actions , or compose an email refusing to say sorry			1
when faced with making a difficult life decision , many of us can spend hours agonising over what to do			0
but new research has discovered that this is perhaps not the best way to find a solution			0
instead , we should trust our intuition and make a quick decision			0
researchers in @entity52 found that decisions made on the spur of the moment are just as good as when we take our time			2
they discovered that when rats were challenged with a series of perceptual decision problems , their performance was just as good when they decided rapidly as when they took a much longer time to respond			0
in both cases , @entity13 said , refusing to apologise provided psychological benefits			1
the same thing also happened when people were asked to imagine doing something wrong , and then imagine apologising or refusing to apologise			1
the research group said it could give an explanation as to why people are so often reluctant to say sorry			2
@entity13 said when we refuse to apologise , it actually makes us feel more empowered			0
he said : ' that power and control seems to translate into greater feelings of self - worth			0
' he added : ' we do find that apologies do make apologisers feel better , but the interesting thing is that refusals to apologise also make people feel better and , in fact , in some cases it makes them feel better than an apology would have			2

' empowerment ' from refusing to say sorry can outweigh relief of apologising
tests by @entity16 found there were psychological benefits
could explain why people are often reluctant to say sorry , researchers say
