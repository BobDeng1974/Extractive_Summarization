so when he found a grubby old jug while underpinning a house on the island of @entity9 , he just threw it in the back of his van without a second thought			1
it was eight years later when he stumbled across it again in his father ’s basement where he ’d left it and decided to clean it			1
rare : the collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s , pictured with a 15th century @entity27 @entity26 jug chance find : @entity3 ( right ) with the jug and his father @entity30 ( left ) when he tipped it up , to his amazement out fell a pile of gold and silver coins - including one stamped with pope @entity36 , who famously refused to annul the marriage of @entity38 to @entity39 in the 1520s			1
the coin , called a scudo , comes from @entity43 in central @entity44 and is believed to be possibly only the second of its kind discovered anywhere in the world			2
it is so rare that experts mr @entity3 contacted in @entity44 are only aware of one other coin like it having been sold in the last two decades			1
together , the collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s could be worth tens of thousands in total , but the rarity of the scudo means putting an exact price on them has so far been impossible			1
@entity63 spread : the coins are from @entity44 , @entity65 and @entity66 the coins found are said to come from across @entity68 and date back to the 16th @entity69 of them is said to be a gold scudo , a coin made in @entity44 in the 1500s			1
the scudo originates from @entity43 , in central @entity44 , and is stamped with the sign of pope @entity36 , who famously refused to annul the marriage of @entity38 to @entity39 in 1527			0
it is believed to be the first coin of its type discovered anywhere in the @entity83 of the coins has been identified as a silver thaler , a coin made @entity27 during the 1500s			1
the thaler was eventually adopted by the early @entity89 colonies and later become known as the dollar			0
mr @entity3 , 38 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , found the ceramic jug in 2003			1
after stumbling upon the coins in 2011 , he took his find to show a local archaeologist who then reported the find to the @entity98			2
an inquest in @entity92 recently determined that the find was ‘ treasure trove ’			0
the case is currently being considered by the government ’s @entity103 , which will put a value on the coins on december 5			2
the @entity107 at @entity108 is hoping to raise the money to acquire them once they are valued			0
the funds are likely to be shared between mr @entity3 and the unnamed owner of the land where the jug was found			1
on wednesday mr @entity3 , who runs a construction firm with his father , said the house they were working on when they found the jug was built in 1962 , but stood on top of the remains of a 14th century building			1
builder @entity3 said he was ' tickled pink ' by the discovery of the coins , which are currently being valued by the government 's @entity103 he said : ‘ i was hand digging around a pipe and i heard a clunk			1
i thought " that ’s strange " so i dug around it and exposed a little jug			2
i pulled the jug out , it was covered in mud and clarts			2
‘ i had a quick look inside it appeared empty			2
i chucked it in the back of the van			0
only recently , did i think it was worth giving the jug a little spring clean			2
i could n’t believe it when all this gold and silver dropped out			0
‘ i ’m absolutely tickled pink			0
discovering something this rare does n’t happen every day			2
i ’ve never really found anything of any value of significance before			0
’ the collection of coins is currently being held by the @entity98			0
@entity157 , treasure registrar at the @entity98 said : ‘ these coins were probably savings that were built up over a number of years and buried to keep them safe			1
‘ there are coins from @entity44 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
foreign coins could be used in this country much more easily in the 16th century			0
‘ we do n’t know who owned the coins			0
but for whatever reason , it seems they were n’t able to come back and collect them			0
@entity9 lies off the north - east coast of @entity175 ‘ they may have forgotten where they buried them or they may have met with an untimely end			0
it ’s rare to get a complete vessel like this full of coins			1
it ’s an unusual find			0
’ one coin has been identified as a silver thaler , a coin made in @entity27 in the 1500s			0
the thaler was eventually adopted by the early @entity89 colonies and later become known as the dollar			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ @entity9 , or @entity9 as we call it up here , was a well - used naval base in the 16th century			1
it ’s not impossible that coins from all over @entity68 will have landed there			1
’ in 1963 , @entity200 , from @entity201 , found a pile of @entity204 silver coins in almost the same spot on @entity9			1
those 50 coins are now housed at the @entity207 , in @entity208 .			0

some of the coins are so rare that it 's been impossible to value them
they were found by builder @entity3 in a jug that he *'d* stumbled across during a routine *job*
the jug lay in mr @entity3 's dad 's basement for eight years before the coins were discovered inside it
