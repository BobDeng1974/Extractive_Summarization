it is a question that has long occupied the hungry minds of millions hoping to lose weight - what is the best diet to help shift the pounds ? a plethora of mantras adorning bookshelves , a constant stream of celebrity - endorsed plans bursting with promises of quick weight loss , and a flurry of new ' superfoods ' each week , makes the journey to slim down a confusing one			1
but a new three - part @entity17 series aims to offer the answer tonight			1
one of the biggest studies of its kind in the @entity23 , the programme investigates the science behind the latest diet fads			1
what is the @entity29 , a @entity28 series , sees a team of experts considering the effect of biochemistry , psychology and genes on weight gain			1
@entity37 below to take the quiz instead of buying into the latest dieting fad , the scientists found the only way to successfully lose weight is to use a personalised diet , built around an understanding of a person 's individual biology and specific needs			1
professor @entity48 , a clinical psychologist with 25 years experience , said the study used cutting edge science from @entity53 to develop tailor - made weight loss plans for 75 overweight volunteers			1
the dieters firstly took part in a complex screening process to establish a range of things , including the levels of a specific gut hormone , as well as each person 's genetic make up			2
they were then split in to three groups , and given a tailor - made diet to follow for three months			1
professor @entity66 told @entity67 : ' some we found were emotional eaters , those who used emotional coping mechanisms			2
' then there were people with low levels of the gut hormone @entity75 , which signals the brain , telling it a person is full			0
' they were known as the feasters , who do n't necessarily eat all the time , but when they do , they find it hard to stop			2
' and the third group , the constant cravers , were those whose genes drive them to eat			2
they are more grazers , they do n't eat huge amounts in one sitting			2
' we spent a lot of time examining the results of the screening , conducting further experiments to test different factors that affected the results , to make sure the categories were correct			0
' a new three - part @entity28 special investigates the science behind the latest diet fads , helping separate 75 overweight volunteers into three categories : emotional eaters , @entity108 and @entity109 emotional @entity107 emotional eaters are those people who eat for psychological reasons , turning to junk food when they are anxious , depressed or stressed			1
studies have shown that the most effective way to lose weight for emotional eaters , is to attend a weight loss group			1
the groups will supply a diet plan of low - fat , calorie - controlled recipes to follow			1
for emotional eaters the support of fellow dieters is a powerful tool , helping drive weight loss			1
and the impending weekly weigh in helps in moments of stress , when a person might be tempted to break their diet			2
@entity109 when most people eat , a specific hormones in our gut send a strong message to the brain , telling the brain the stomach is full			2
but if a person is a feaster , scientists believe they produce less of the gut hormone , @entity75			0
it means the signal telling a person to stop eating is weaker			0
to lose weight , feasters need to eat certain foods that help boost the production of gut hormones			1
a diet high in protein and low glycaemic index ( @entity155 ) carbohydrates has been found to encourage production of the vital hormones , and increase feelings of fullness			0
constant cravers constant cravers feel hungry most of the time			0
scientists believe this factor could indicate a person has more of the genes that tend to make you feel hungrier			0
this increases the likelihood of eating too much and gaining weight			0
because constant cravers are constantly hungry , it is hard to sustain the effort to reduce calorie intake every day			0
so the diet involves two restricted days , where a person will limit their calorie intake to no more than 600 - 800 calories a day , with virtually no foods or drinks containing carbohydrates			1
the other five days are unrestricted , meaning a person does not need to count calories or limit carbohydrates , but must eat a healthy @entity188 - style diet			1
personalised diet plans were then designed for each group , based on each of the three profiles			0
emotional eaters were encouraged to join weight loss groups and received @entity195			1
' i did a lot of work with this group , ' professor @entity66 said			0
' in tonight 's programme you will see us abseilling down a light house			1
' the idea was to get them past the " i cant do this " , " i am a failure " way of thinking about dieting , and show them if they can abseil down a building , they can do anything			0
' dr @entity213 , an infectious diseases specialist from @entity215 , focused on working with those volunteers in the @entity217 and @entity108 category			0
the @entity108 were put on an intermittent fasting diet , with two days of low calorie intake and healthy eating for the remaining five days			1
and for @entity109 , their diet was designed to maximise the production of the @entity75 hormone , and promotes eating foods that are digested in that part of the gut			1
professor @entity66 told @entity67 the study , which is among the first of its kind , far exceeded the scientists ' hopes			0
' all the volunteers did unbelievably well , they exceeded our targets set for three months , which was that they would lose five per cent of their weight in that time			2
' it was an incredible experiment , that was about helping people understand themselves better , to generate more understanding of their behaviours			0
' you are more likely to be able to change your behaviour to lose weight and maintain your weight loss			1
' it was about giving people the information and helping them use it to change their behaviour and lifestyle			0
' dr @entity213 added : ' one of the biggest things was trying to get away from the idea that fat , overweight people are lazy			2
' there are huge numbers of biological factors outside people 's control , like hormones or genes , that means it can be harder for some people to lose weight			0
' but rather than give people an excuse for why they are overweight , dr @entity213 told @entity67 the study actually empowers people to understand their bodies and learn the best way to shed pounds			0
a team of experts worked with scientists from @entity53 to screen the 75 volunteers looking at how their biology affects weight gain			1
the tests looked at levels of a gut hormone @entity75 and each person 's genes to try and establish the best way to help each individual shed pounds after being split into the three groups , the volunteers were given a tailor made dieting plan to follow for three months			1
emotional eaters were advised to join weight loss groups and were given @entity195 , @entity108 were put on an intermittent fasting diet with two days low calorie intake , while @entity109 were put on a high protein , high low @entity155 carbohydrate diet dr @entity297 , third from right , and professor @entity48 , second right , said the study exceeded their expectations			1
they told @entity67 the key was to help people understand their biological make up , to follow diets that they are more likely to be able to maintain , by changing habits and creating new behaviours ' when people understand the biology of any medical problem , it empowers them to deal with it , ' he said			2
' almost every person has , at some point , tried to lose weight , most will have failed or lost the weight and put it back on			2
' the message is that any diet will work if you stick to it , ' dr @entity213 said			0
' this study was about trying to identify those people a diet that they will find it easier to stick to			0
' it is about building new habits and changing behaviours			0
' like if you are trying to learn a new foreign language , it is difficult because if it does n't come with the lifestyle advice , it will be hard to achieve			0
' it is not about willpower			0
no one can will themselves thin but you can create a life environment to help you lose weight			0
