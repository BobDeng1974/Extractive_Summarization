the dominant @entity8 side hit the post just before the break through @entity11 and again in the second half through fellow midfielder @entity13 , with the @entity14 rarely threatening			1
however , the @entity5 were stunned in the 74th minute when @entity0 midfielder @entity15 headed in a @entity17 cross to set up a meeting on may 30 with either @entity19 or @entity20			1

for their part , @entity5 , last winners of the trophy in 1902 , will wonder if that curse will ever be broken after a semi-final in which they had bossed for long spells			0
both managers were forced into changes for the all - championship last - four tie			0
@entity5 midfielder @entity38 replaced @entity88 who is cup - tied after playing for parent club @entity89 in the competition before his loan move to @entity8			2
@entity0 manager @entity93 had @entity94 and @entity95 cup - tied and top scorer @entity96 failed to recover from an ankle injury as captain @entity51 returned to defence with forward @entity58 given a start			2
@entity5 manager @entity99 ( left ) and @entity0 manager @entity93 shake hands before the match the @entity5 supporters ca n't quite believe their luck as @entity11 and @entity13 both hit the woodwork @entity40 misses from close range for @entity5 on one of those afternoon 's for @entity99 ' side there was n't much too cheer about for @entity5 fans in a sparse @entity6 crowd on saturday @entity0 went into the game undefeated in three league games against @entity5 this season , drawing two and winning one , but found themselves under pressure from the first whistle			1
indeed , @entity119 's side were lucky to escape going behind after only six minutes when @entity121 's fine cross from the right was directed toward his own goal by the foot of the stretching @entity51			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity49 chested it straight to the falling former @entity0 striker @entity127 but , while flat on the ground , he headed straight into the arms of the grateful @entity14 keeper			0
the @entity14 hit back immediately			0
midfielder @entity55 ' long - range drive was deflected past the post as @entity5 withstood a brief spell of pressure , with @entity51 heading a @entity15 corner just past the near post			1
the tempo then subsided , as if both teams had surprised themselves with their early boldness			0
@entity5 were the slicker but their final ball was lacking and so was their luck , it appeared			0
two minutes from the break , after @entity41 had hit the side - netting , @entity11 's low drive from around 30 yards beat @entity49			1
@entity53 celebrates @entity0 's win ( left ) as @entity5 's @entity38 looks dejected at the final whistle however , the ball bounced off the post and back to the keeper who , like the @entity0 fans , again breathed a sigh of relief			1
@entity93 replaced @entity56 with @entity154 for the start of the second half but , in the 47th minute , it was @entity17 who forced @entity5 keeper @entity33 to push his 25 - yard shot round the post for a corner , which came to nothing			1
the @entity8 men then dominated			0
in the 64th minute , as they pinned @entity0 back in their box again , @entity37 got his legs tangled trying to execute a volley before @entity40 skied his close - range shot high over the bar			1
then @entity13 brilliantly weaved his way into the @entity0 penalty area before driving against the bar , with @entity127 heading his corner over moments later			2
but the @entity5 were stunned when @entity0 took the lead			2
there was little imminent danger when @entity17 got past @entity38 down the right , but he whipped in a delightful cross and @entity15 escaped the attention of @entity37 to power a header past @entity33			0
reeling @entity5 threw everything forward in search of a leveller			0
a @entity35 tackle prevented @entity154 getting his shot away on the counter - @entity0 cries for a penalty were dismissed by referee @entity67 - before @entity49 made a crucial save from @entity41 at his near post			2
@entity0 then held out for the three minutes of added time to spark scenes of joy among players and fans at the final whistle .			0

@entity15 's 74th - minute header is enough to send @entity0 through
