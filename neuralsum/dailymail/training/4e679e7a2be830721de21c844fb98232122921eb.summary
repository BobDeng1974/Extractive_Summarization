by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 6 september 2013 the next prime minister ? polls show @entity4 's liberal - national coalition heading for a landslide victory @entity4 , leader of @entity7 's opposition party , looks set to win the country 's national election on saturday ending six years of @entity11 rule			1
pledging to be ' a leader for everyone ' the father of three said : ' if it happens , i will be extraordinarily conscious of the heavy burden of responsibility , of the duties , the extraordinary duties , that will have descended upon my shoulders			0
' a @entity23 poll on friday showed mr @entity4 's liberal - national coalition with a 54 to 46 per cent lead			2
however current prime minister @entity26 refused to rule his party out , saying : ' there is fight in the old dog yet			1
' i believe we can do it			0
this is not wishful thinking â€“ it 's a matter of looking at the maths			0
' if @entity4 does win , he will have successfully fought off criticism , some of it from within his own party , that he had become unelectable			1
a series of high - profile political gaffes over the years had left him unpopular with the @entity7 public , particularly after being labelled as ' sexist ' and ' a misogynist ' by the ex-prime minister @entity44			0
the staunch conservative and monarchist also once listed a female candidate 's ' sex appeal ' as a political asset , and accidentally drew laughter while saying that nobody is ' the suppository of all wisdom			0
' fitness fanatic and @entity54 boxer @entity4 says an election win will not interrupt his morning run however @entity57 , the former @entity7 @entity11 prime minister , said @entity11 's six years in power have been a ' bloody mixed bag ' and blamed the party for underestimating mr @entity60 to @entity61 he said : ' a lot of the @entity11 in the last 12 months or so made the mistake of underrating @entity4			1
' ' @entity4 has historically been capable of some awful gaffes , as people will tell you ... but he 's shown considerable discipline in his campaign			2
' if @entity11 are defeated it will mean humiliation for them , having unceremoniously dumped their former leader , and @entity7 's fist female pm , @entity44 in the hopes of reviving their appeal			2
current prime minister @entity26 ( left ) was brought in by the @entity11 to replace @entity7 's first female pm @entity44 ( right ) in the hope it would revive their standing in the polls while @entity26 , a mandarin - speaking ex-diplomat , remained consistently ahead of @entity4 in the opinion polls until this week , he has failed to reignite his party			1
by contrast @entity4 has punished @entity11 's errors at every turn while campaigning on pledges to cut carbon and mining taxes			1
he has also promised to take a tougher stance towards asylum seekers arriving by boat , to reduce spending and foreign aid , cut the public service and introduce one of the world 's most generous parental leave schemes			0
the fitness fanatic and @entity54 boxer said that the win , if it comes , would not disrupt his morning run , though conceded he would be in for briefings later ' because you ca n't muck around with something as important as the future of our country			0

despite being unpopular in opinion polls victory looks likely for @entity4
*embarrassment* for @entity11 as @entity26 fails to revive party
a win for @entity4 on saturday will mean an end to @entity11 's six year rule
