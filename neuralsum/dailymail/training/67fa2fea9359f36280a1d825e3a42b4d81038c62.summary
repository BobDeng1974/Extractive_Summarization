@entity1 's fringe was the subject of debate on @entity4 after she appeared to have trouble keeping it out of her eyes while giving a speech			1
the @entity8 had a blunt fringe - or bangs as they say in the @entity12 - cut in january earlier this year			1
but in may she reverted to her longer , side - swept look after the president spoofed the look in some photoshopped pictures shown during his annual speech at the @entity18 in april			1
and today as she gave a speech at the @entity20 in @entity21 , the @entity8 went for a softer look with flicks reminiscent of @entity24 in the 70s			0
one user , @entity40 ( @ scrossannz ) , wrote on @entity4 : ' watching @entity1 's speech in @entity21			0
impressive but i wish she would get her fringe sorted out			0
' another user called @entity45 ( @ brennanmckeag ) added : ' @entity1 's fringe annoyed me the whole way through her speech , why did n't she just sweep it off her face ! ? ' @entity50 ( @ @entity51 ) tweeted : ' @entity1 is a terrific speaker this morning			2
why do i desperately want to give her a hair clip ? ' got the message : at an event just a few hours later , her hair was more firmly cast out of her eyeline much better : earlier in the day ( left ) , her bangs were astray but the fringe was cast in place for a visit to the @entity61 in @entity62 on monday evening ( right ) the speech saw the first lady urge around 2,000 schoolchildren , university students and graduates to step outside their comfort zones , challenge the status quo and help create a lasting peace in @entity71			2
mrs @entity1 spoke for 10 minutes before her husband took to the stage , and was introduced by 16 - year - old schoolgirl @entity74 , who spoke of her desire to see greater stability in @entity71			0
she later flew to @entity62 with daughters @entity77 , 14 , and @entity79 , 12			0
disheveled : the errant hair caught the attention of members of the audience fringe whinge : these @entity4 uses lashed out at @entity1 's unruly fringe during her speech today bang on trend ? left , @entity1 's longer , 70s style fringe that riled @entity4 users today in @entity21			2
@entity91 , the original fringe that garnered endless attention in a portrait released by the @entity18 in february this year no stragglers : a neat side - swept look in march 2011 , left , and right , and a shorter look in june later the same year feeling quiffy ? @entity100 , a swept - back style from december 2011 , and right , a little quiff in may the same year			1

first lady had blunt fringe cut in january this year
president @entity1 *lampooned* her haircut at @entity18 speech in april
@entity1 *changed* ' bangs ' back to her former side - swept look in may
but today as she spoke at @entity20 the fringe constantly fell into her eyes
one @entity4 user asked why the @entity8 did n't sweep it off her face
another said they wanted to ' give her a hair clip '
but some hit back saying , ' stop *focusing* on looks . she was there to speak '
