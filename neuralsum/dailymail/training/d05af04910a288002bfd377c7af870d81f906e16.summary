by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 20:13 est , 1 may 2012 @entity1 are to receive taxpayer - funded @entity2 in an attempt to modernise @entity4			1
politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return			0
around 350 mps who sit in the @entity13 on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade			2
must - have : the commons commission says mps on select committees need @entity20 's flagship gadget to save paper and cut costs buying an @entity2 for every single mp in the @entity13 could cost as much as £ 430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move			1
but the @entity13 commission , led by speaker @entity28 , insisted the move would cut costs and save paper			1
modernisation : speaker @entity28 led the commission that ruled around 350 mps should be given the tablet computers for free the commons authorities changed the rules last year to allow mps to use @entity2 and @entity36 in the @entity13 chamber so that they can surf the web and check emails during debates			1
in october , @entity41 , deputy leader of the @entity13 , became the first minister to use an @entity2 at the despatch box			1
freedom of information requests have revealed that 70 mps have already claimed on their expenses accounts for the devices , which sell for between £ 400 and £ 660			0
the @entity48 , which is in charge of allowances , originally turned down the request , but backed down on appeal			0
early last year , some 16 mps began a trial to find out whether using @entity2 could improve @entity4 ’s way of working			2
last month , the @entity56 concluded that the devices would reduce paperwork and even end up saving the taxpayer money			0
it recommended the ‘ rapid roll - out of suitable mobile tablet hardware ’ to all 650 mps			0
early adopter : deputy @entity64 @entity41 became the first minister to use an @entity2 in the despatch box in october the @entity66 is also considering similar moves to give free @entity2 to its members			1
ten peers have taken part in a similar trial , at a cost of more than £ 4,900			2
the @entity73 insisted the scheme would save money while reducing ‘ expenditure on paper and reprographics and improve environmental performance ’			2
the body also said the move to allow mps to exchange their laptops for an @entity2 would save £ 50,000 on the cost of replacing laptops for other staff			1
it added : ‘ further work would be undertaken to ascertain the level of additional savings which could be realised by wider use of @entity2 for mps			0
' these measures would be kept under review to assess the impact on parliamentary effectiveness and value for money			0
’ but @entity99 , of the @entity100 ’ @entity98 , said : ‘ with the public finances in such a mess , the last thing taxpayers want is to fork out for a new toy for mps			0
' it might start with those on select committees but it ’s bound to be rolled out across the @entity13 soon			0
‘ it ’s a perfectly good intention to want to modernise @entity4 , save paper and cut costs , but an @entity2 is a premium product , which means it comes with a premium price tag			1
‘ it ’s good to see an initiative to get members to swap laptops for @entity2 , so taxpayers do n’t pay for both , but there is no reason not to look at other , cheaper alternatives			2
