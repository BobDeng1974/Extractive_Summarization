no more meat products : former vice president @entity0 has recently switched to a vegan diet , meaning that he does not eat any animal products and only plants - based food ( seen here in october of this year ) fluctuation : @entity0 's weight has changed dramatically immediately after he lost the 2000 election as many thought he was depressed ( seen at left during the campaign , and at right less than a year later ) the switch does n't come as a massive surprise considering his weight has fluctuated over the years and recently admitted that he was trying to be healthier			1
during an interview with @entity33 in may of this year , he was described as serving himself a vegetable soup and salad followed by a fruit salad for dessert			0
' i have been eating more healthfully			0
i ’ve been trying to get in much better shape , and i ’ve enjoyed that , ' he told the magazine			0
the switch to a completely animal - free diet does show a shift in ideology , at least on the personal level , for the politician - turned - environmental advocate			2
@entity0 has dedicated much of his career following the presidential defeat in 2000 to working against climate change and global warming , but he came under fire from the @entity54 for not pushing for vegetarianism - or even being fully vegetarian himself			0
' i 'm not a vegetarian , but i have cut back sharply on the meat that i eat , ' he said in 2009			0
back in the day : @entity58 and @entity0 , seen during their first bid for the @entity61 in 1992 , were noticeably heavier in their younger years and were omnivores on the campaign trail setting a good example : their kick into health awareness started while in office , as then - first lady @entity70 imposed healthier options at the @entity61 mess ( seen jogging during the 1992 campaign ) ' i 've made those changes , and while i do n't go quite as far as ... saying everybody should become a vegetarian ... it is a legitimate point of view			2
' @entity0 's former running mate @entity58 made a very public switch to a vegetable - heavy diet after a number of heart problems including quadruple bypass in 2004 and the implementation of two stents in 2010			1
while the former president has said that he considers himself a vegan since he largely abides by the plant - based diet , he did also reveal to the @entity89 that he has a serving of salmon or eggs once every week in order to get sufficient protein and iron			1
changes : @entity58 , who has had multiple heart scares , said that he changed his diet so he could live to see his grandchildren			1

' it 's just a good thing to do , it will be healthier for you and you put less stress on your cardiovascular system , ' @entity58 told fellow - vegan @entity114 on her talks show in may of last year			2
while his fish and egg exceptions would still qualify him as a vegetarian , he does have one major cheat break coming up : he told @entity121 's @entity120 that in 2010 he broke all the rules and had turkey on @entity124 - but only one bite .			0

@entity58 switched to the plant - based diet in 2010 following a number of heart scares
now his former vice president has also given up all animal - based food
@entity0 's veganism also falls in line with his environmental *activism*
