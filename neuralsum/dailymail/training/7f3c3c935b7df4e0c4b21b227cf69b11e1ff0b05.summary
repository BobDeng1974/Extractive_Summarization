former president @entity0 and his wife , former secretary of state @entity1 , are worth between $ 10 and $ 50 million , according to their financial disclosure forms – but taxpayers will still pony up nearly $ 1 million this year to fund their post-white @entity6 lifestyle			1
like the three other living former presidents , @entity8 and the two @entity9 , @entity0 receives a $ 201,000 annual pension			1
but that just scratches the surface of the government benefits he shares with his wife @entity1			1
the total for 2014 also includes $ 157,000 for staff salaries and benefits , $ 414,000 for office space and $ 9,000 for phone bills			1
in all , the @entity21 first reported , taxpayers are providing @entity0 with $ 944,000 in post-presidential pay and benefits			2
@entity1 was lambasted in the press for saying on june 9 that she and @entity0 were ' dead broke ' after their @entity6 tenure			1
her rhetorical play at poverty during an @entity60 interview included the claim that she and @entity0 ' struggled to , you know , piece together the resources for mortgages for houses , for @entity68 ’s education , you know – it was not easy			2
' the @entity53 report , issued in april , also noted that government payments and benefits for former president @entity40 outstripped @entity0 's in every full year since @entity40 left the @entity6			1
@entity40 the younger is costing taxpayers $ 1.28 million this year , and averages 4 per cent more annual than @entity0			1
the government 's @entity74 inexplicably budgeted $ 102,000 for @entity40 's telephone expenses in 2014 , and planned to spend $ 135,000 more on furniture , computers , office supplies and other miscellany			1
the former president and first lady both tried to pivot away from the national frenzy over their elite financial status on tuesday , with @entity0 saying that his wife is ' not out of touch ' with the middle - class @entity88			1
during an annual @entity91 conference in @entity92 , he told event moderator @entity94 of @entity96 ’s ' @entity95 ' on stage that discussing their millions is ' the wrong debate ' to have in the run - up to the 2016 election season			1
instead , according to @entity101 , he claimed the public should focus on how to counter the ' demise of the @entity88 dream			0
' he acknowledged that @entity1 did n’t ' give the most adept answer ' to questions about whether they were as wealthy as @entity108 politicians who have been tripped up by insinuations of upper - class snobbery			2
' you can say , " ok , i got ta clean that up , " which she did , ' he claimed			0
but ' it is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt , ' @entity0 said , and reporters ' should put this in some sort of context			1
' he also claimed that he had ' the lowest net worth of any @entity88 president in the twentieth century when i took office , but i still could have been tone deaf			0
and , you know , now i do n’t			0
and we ’ve got a great life and i ’m grateful for it			0
' ' but i still , we go to our local grocery store on the weekend			2
we talk to people in our town			0
we know what ’s going on			0
the real issue is , if you ’ve been fortunate enough to be successful , are you now out of touch and insensitive to the agonizing struggles other people are facing ? ' pivot : on tuesday in @entity92 @entity0 tried to reposition his wife @entity1 , the former secretary of state , describing her as a warrior for poor and middle - class @entity88 instead of a wealthy , out - of - touch elitist at the same @entity92 event , @entity1 repositioned herself as a warrior for the downtrodden , including poor children			1
upward mobility ' really does take a village , ' she said			0
mrs. @entity1 has n't yet said whether she will run for president			2
her missteps in recent weeks , along with lackluster sales of her memoir ' @entity152 , ' have become the first chink in what was thought to be an unassailable political armor			0
the @entity156 of 1958 provides one - time residents of the @entity6 with pensions , office expenses , professional staff , coverage for medical care , and lifetime @entity164 protection			2
@entity167 @entity166 rep. @entity166 tried to change the arrangement in 2012 with his @entity169 , but it died in committee			0
the legislation would have capped the government 's total spending on any former president to $ 400,000			2
and that amount would have been reduced dollar - for - dollar by any money they earned			0
ka - ching : @entity0 and @entity40 together collect more than $ 2 million each year in taxpayer money and benefits -- not including the cost of @entity164 protection -- and will continue that pace until they die according to the nonpartisan @entity53 , @entity40 costs taxpayers more in his post-presidency than any other former president under that scenario , @entity0 would have received nothing this year and last year			1
his earnings for individual speeches reportedly can top $ 500,000			0
' nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute , " @entity166 said at the time , ' but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor			0
' ' reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees , these men are making millions of dollars a year			0
there 's little reason why @entity88 taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they 're doing fine on their own			0
' @entity8 , who left office in 1981 , spends the least among the four living former presidents			2
his office space costs just $ 109,000 per year , and the @entity74 budgeted $ 466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014 .			1

@entity0 said tuesday his wife 's claim that they were ' dead broke ' after his presidency was ' factually true '
he and @entity1 are not ' out of touch , ' he *insisted* , because they go to the grocery store and ' talk to people in our town '
an april @entity53 report found that the *federal* government has spent $ 15.9 million on @entity0 's *retirement* since 2001
he got $ 1.28 million in benefits the year after he left office
@entity0 said tuesday that attacking his wife as a wealthy elite in the run - up to the 2016 election is ' the wrong debate '
this year @entity0 's costs include a $ 201,000 pension , $ 157,000 for staff salaries and benefits , $ 414,000 for office space and $ 9,000 for phone bills
former president @entity40 spends even more , costing taxpayers $ 1.28 million this year and averaging 4 per cent more per year than @entity0
the government inexplicably budgeted $ 102,000 for @entity40 's telephone expenses in 2014 , and planned to spend $ 135,000 more on furniture , computers , office supplies and other miscellany
