' feeling ' low ' after having a baby , also known as the ' baby blues ' , is so common it is considered normal , but 10 - 15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and long - term condition called post-natal depression ( @entity254 )			0
it usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on gradually or suddenly , and can range from being relatively mild to quite severe			0
sufferers may feel sad or low , unable to cope , and hostile or indifferent to their husband , partner or baby			0
they may have thoughts about death , be unable to sleep , and feel hopeless about the future			0
many of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it , but doctors say that if @entity254 is diagnosed and addressed , it is likely to pass sooner and to be less severe			0
post-natal depression usually develops within six weeks of giving birth			0
( posed by model ) treatments for @entity254 include counselling and psychotherapy , and antidepressants , which can be very effective			0
tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for short - term use			0
some women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy , massage , and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety			0
practical and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a great help to those suffering from @entity254			0
getting out to meet other parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and anxious after having a baby , while exercise can also work as an antidepressant			0
