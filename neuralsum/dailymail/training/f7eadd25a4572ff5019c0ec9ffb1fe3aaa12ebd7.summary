by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 17:43 est , 29 january 2013 less than half of @entity3 's rail passengers think the railways are value for money despite train operators celebrating ' record ' satisfaction poll results			1
the damning verdict comes after passengers were hit with inflation - busting fare rises in january of up to 10 per cent			1
satisfaction with ‘ value for money ’ averages a paltry 47 per cent – dropping to just 29 per cent for the lowest scoring train company			1
rated joint worst for value for money are @entity16 ( pictured ) and @entity17 up to one in five passengers of the worst performing train companies remain dissatisfied with the overall service they get			1
on individual routes , up to a quarter of passengers are unimpressed with services according to the latest satisfaction survey by consumer watchdog @entity26			1
despite this , train companies were celebrating ‘ record ’ satisfaction ratings overall – although they do admit they ‘ must do better			0
’ passenger focus chief executive , @entity30 , welcomed improvements but said ‘ more needs to be done			0
' mixed opinion : passenger focus chief executive , @entity30 ( left ) said ' more needs to be done ' to improve the railways but rail minister @entity35 said the survey was ' encouraging ' @entity37 had one of the lowest satisfaction results among customers in @entity41 rated joint worst for value for money are @entity16 and @entity17 ( both 37 per cent ) , @entity43 and @entity44 ( both 38 per cent ) , @entity45 ( 40 per cent ) , @entity46 ( 42 per cent ) , c2c ( 46 per cent ) , @entity44 ( 49 per cent ) and @entity47 ( 50 per cent )			1
but when broken down to individual routes , the figures are even more shocking			0
how services fare in the survey by @entity26 just 29 per cent of passengers on the @entity17 mainline are satisfied it is value for money			1
on @entity16 ’s @entity59 and @entity60 service , the figure is just 33 per cent while @entity41 services stand at 35 per cent			1
@entity62 , chief executive of the @entity63 said : ‘ there is no room for complacency			0
' far too many passengers remain frustrated at spiralling ticket prices , overcrowding and delays			2
' the government must end above inflation fares hikes			0
’ thirty five per cent of customers believe @entity46 's @entity74 is value for money while @entity43 ’s mainline services rates just 36 per cent			2
fewer than 48 per cent of passengers on @entity37 ’s @entity80 services think they get value for their ticket price			2
but it is even worse on @entity44 ’s @entity85 services at just 34 per cent			2
north of the border , only just 52 per cent of @entity88 passengers were satisfied with the value for money – dropping to just 40 per cent for urban services			1
satisfaction levels for value for money from individual operators also dropped for @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity88 seeing the largest falls of six per cent - down to 73 per cent , 52 per cent and 52 per cent respectively			2
overall satisfaction on individual routes ‘ still varies widely ’ for the worst performing @entity103 ’s @entity101 & @entity102 route ( 76 per cent ) to the top rated @entity105 on the @entity106 ( 97 per cent ) , operated by @entity16			1
however , the survey says passengers across @entity3 have reported ‘ record levels ’ of overall satisfaction with train services – 85 per cent overall with no operator scoring less than 80 per cent			1
lowest ratings for overall satisfaction were given to @entity103 ( 80 per cent ) , @entity44 ( 81 per cent ) , @entity46 ( 82 per cent ) , @entity17 , @entity37 and @entity116 ( all at 83 per cent )			1
highest ratings for overall satisfaction were achieved by @entity95 ( 96 per cent ) , @entity118 ( 95 per cent ) , and @entity96 ( 94 per cent )			0
@entity45 , c2c , and @entity119 all scored 93 per cent satisfaction rating			0
nationally , some 83 per cent of passengers were satisfied with punctuality , up from 81 per cent in the autumn of last year			2
but there were wide differences with the worst performers @entity116 , @entity46 and @entity103 and @entity37			0
@entity127 , chief executive of the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) said the findings were ‘ further evidence of the success of today 's railway ’ saying : ‘ overall passenger satisfaction is at a record high and people are taking the train in growing numbers			0
’ but he added : ‘ we recognise there is still much to be done			0
’ rail minister @entity35 added : ‘ it is very encouraging that satisfaction levels are at a record high of 85 per cent			0
‘ but there are areas where satisfaction is lower such as on fares , which is why we are determined to end the era of above - inflations increases as soon as we can			0
