by @entity0 last updated at 7:56 am on 4th january 2012 end of the hearing aid ? scientists have discovered a gene which could hold the key to reversing deafness scientists have found a single gene they believe could hold the key to age - related deafness			1
the breakthrough brings the prospect of a treatment to prevent hearing loss , which affects half of people over 60 , a step closer			0
when the @entity19 gene was taken out in mice , the animals appeared perfectly healthy , but could not hear at all			1
the researchers , at @entity22 , found two - thirds of their outer hair cells , the delicate cells in the inner ear which amplify sounds , had disappeared			1
damage to these cells is associated with the most hearing loss related to old age , noise exposure and some genetic conditions			1
the study suggests this gene – which is also found in humans – could be critical to attempts to growing new hair cells , considered the holy grail of those researching treatments for deafness			1
because our bodies have no way of replacing these cells , there is currently no cure although hearing aids can provide some relief			0
however gradual age - related hearing loss still leaves sufferers socially isolated and many take several years to seek help			0
the researchers ‘ knocked out ’ the gene in mice by removing a protein which causes it to develop while they are in the womb			1
it is one of a number of genes – called fibroblast growth factors – which are crucial in tissue development and wound healing in embryos			0
but removing it at this early stage did not seem to cause any other adverse effects			0
researchers found that when the @entity19 gene was removed from mice , the animals appeared perfectly healthy , but could not hear at all ( file picture ) in particular , the inner hair cells , which electrically transmit the amplified sounds to the brain , appeared normal			1
lead author dr @entity79 said : ‘ this is the first evidence that inner and outer hair cells develop independently of one another			0
' this is important because most age - related hearing loss and noise - induced hearing loss is due to the loss of outer hair cells			2
’ the next step is to see whether deafness in human is associated with mutations of the same gene , which is already underway			0
hope ? age - related hearing loss can leave sufferers socially isolated , with many taking several years to seek help ( picture posed by model ) professor @entity99 , an expert in the genetics of deafness at the @entity102 in @entity103 , who was not involved in the study , said : ‘ the scientific community is very , very interested in developing a way of triggering regeneration of hair cells			1
‘ they never regenerate once they die , and so there ’s a lot of work going on to understand how we can get over that problem , and try to regenerate the hearing			0
‘ what this study suggests is that @entity19 could be critical for the development of that hair cell , as part of a cocktail of other molecules			2
‘ i would say regenerating hair cells in humans is between 10 and 20 years away			2
it 's a very complicated problem as there are so many genes potentially involved , it ’s like a 1,000 - piece puzzle , but this brings us a bit closer			0
’ @entity136 said : ‘ understanding how cells in the inner ear grow is crucial in developing new therapies for protecting and restoring hearing			1
‘ we are pleased to be funding a new project being run by this research team , which is further investigating the role of @entity19 in hearing			2
' in the future , this could lead to studies to test whether reactivation of @entity19 can regenerate damaged parts of the inner ear			2
’ the study is published today in the journal @entity153 .			0

*extracting* @entity19 gene from mice prevented cells which amplify sounds from developing
may be crucial to efforts to grow new cells in humans which are lost in old age
