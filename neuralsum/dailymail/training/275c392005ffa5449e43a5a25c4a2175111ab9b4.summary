an incredible video has emerged showing the moment an elderly woman bravely confronted two @entity4 militants , telling them their terror group is cursed and that they are not back by @entity6			1
the video , which is believed to have been shot in @entity8 , shows the woman walks up to the fighters ' car , brand them both ' devils ' and tell them : ' i swear nothing you have done was in the way of @entity6 '			1
clearly shocked at being confronted , the men initially plead with the woman , telling her to explain what she means and asking if ' everything is good between us ? '			1
the woman chooses to ignore the men 's attempts to justify @entity24 ' brutality , however , and instead attacks their bloodthirsty savagery and accuses them of ' killing each other like donkeys '			2
repeatedly urging them to ' turn back to @entity6 ' she tells the fighters that @entity24 is cursed and that neither they nor @entity46 's @entity8 regime will emerge from the bloodshed victorious			1
the men initially respond to her berating them by asking her what has prompted her attack			2
they then try to justify their actions by telling her of their recent prayer sessions			0
the woman , who wears traditional @entity58 clothing , ignores the men and continues her attack , swearing at them at insisting that @entity24 ' brutality is ' making us go backwards '			2
becoming increasingly frustrated , the men change their tone and begin telling the woman they are busy and she should go away			1
they then resort to mockery when she begins reciting verses from the @entity66 that warn against fighting and slaughter when it is possible to make peace			0
' you do n't want this slaughtering , nor do you want this murder , ' she says , prompting one of the militants to chillingly reply : ' we have come to you with slaughter '			0
angry : the video begins with the elderly woman walking up to the militants car and berate them for being members of the barbaric terrorist organisation brave : the men initially respond to her berating them by asking her what has prompted her to say @entity24 is cursed			1
they then try to justify their actions by telling her of their recent prayer sessions @entity24 militants ( pictured ) have brought a regime of brutal rape and torture to vast swathes of @entity8 and @entity98 throughout the video the woman 's face twists in fury as she demands they stop killing people			1
' do not slaughter anyone and nobody will slaughter you			0
i swear nothing you have done was in the way of @entity6 , ' she says			1
' @entity6 is watching what you are doing			1
' those who deny our verses and are arrogant towards them , the gates of heaven will not be opened for them , nor will they enter paradise , ' she adds			0
the video then comes to an end without showing what became of the brave elderly woman			1
yesterday @entity127 air force jets bombed @entity24 hideouts in @entity8 , state television said , resuming the intensified raids that ended at the weekend after three days			1
the raids are the first the @entity127 military have announced since three straight days of aerial bombing - in retaliation for the killing of a pilot - that ended on saturday			0
@entity135 was burned to death by @entity4 militants two weeks ago			0
' the airforce has bombed and destroyed select targets of the @entity142 criminal gang this afternoon , ' it said			0
' @entity143 ' is a derogative @entity145 term for the militants			0
@entity4 hostage @entity147 has told his family to ' let him go ' and ' get on with their lives ' - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series			0
in an article released last night for the terror group 's magazine , @entity155 , @entity157 thanks his relatives and fiancee for their ' tireless efforts ' campaigning for his release			1
however , he adds : ' let it go			0
leave it be and get on with your lives , all of you '			0
in an article released last night for the terror group 's magazine , @entity155 , @entity147 thanks his relatives and fiancee for their ' tireless efforts ' campaigning for his release referring to an interview given by his partner , the photo journalist says : ' that was my fiancee , whom i hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on			1
' what can the remnants of one family , smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning , be expected to do by themselves			0
' in the article , @entity147 , 44 , has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against @entity4 , claiming that ' every bomb dropped in @entity8 or @entity98 serves as a recruitment tool for the @entity4 '			2
@entity147 - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago ( pictured ) was ' the last in this series ' the magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot @entity199 by @entity202 fighters and claims by the group that @entity207 aid worker hostage @entity205 had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the @entity127 's shocking murder			2
there has been concern for the safety of @entity147 since he was captured in @entity8 in november 2012 together with the now murdered @entity207 correspondent @entity213			2
eight international hostages , including two @entity215 , have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders @entity147 has been used for a series of nine expertly - made propaganda videos by @entity202 .			0

two isis fighters were sitting in a car when the elderly woman *approached*
she told them the terror group is cursed and that they are not backed by @entity6
militants initially plead with the woman to explain why she is so angry
but they soon begin mocking her and angrily tell her to leave them alone
the *footage* , believed to have been *filmed* in @entity8 , then cuts out and it is not known what *happened* to the elderly woman
