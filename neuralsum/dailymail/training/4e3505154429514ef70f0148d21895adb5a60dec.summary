by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 25 september 2013 it would n't win a beauty contest , but a @entity4 scientist claims an ancient fish has the world 's first face and it challenges current thinking on the history of human evolution			1
a newly - discovered fossil of @entity12 for ' complete jaw ' - was dug up in @entity14 in south west @entity4 and is the most primitive vertebrate to have a modern jaw			2
the ancient creature was about eight inches long and swam in the prehistoric seas 419 million years ago			0
it belonged to a group of early fish known as placoderms that had bony armour , or plates , on their heads and necks			2
a newly - discovered fossil of @entity28 , an armoured fish that swam in the @entity31 seas ( illustration ) , was dug up in @entity14 in south west @entity4			1
the 419 - million - year - old fossil ( inset ) is prompting scientists to rethink how the living groups of jawed vertebrates acquired their characteristic features the superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish - offering a new perspective on early evolution but the superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish , offering a new perspective on early evolution			1
the gap between jawed and jawless vertebrates is so large that it is hard to work out the individual steps in the transition			0
this creature described in the journal @entity55 brings scientists closer to understanding when modern jawed animals with backbones such as sharks and bony fish emerged from a collection of jawed , armoured placoderms			1
jaws enabled vertebrates to become predators ; an important step in the development of complex forms such as humans			0
@entity28 had jaw bone features previously restricted to bony fish called osteichthyans , as well as full body armour seen in placoderms			1
professor @entity76 , of the @entity77 , @entity78 , said : ' until now jaw bones have never been found in any placoderms			1
' sluggish placoderms are believed to have become extinct due to competition from the swifter bony fish and early sharks			1
dr @entity85 , of @entity86 and dr @entity87 , of @entity88 , reviewed the study for the journal and said it challenges the view that the most recent common ancestor of jawed vertebrates resembled modern sharks			1
they believe it provides compelling evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and osteichthyans and adjusts our understanding of early evolution			0
the palaeontologists said : ' jawed vertebrates - or gnathostomes - comprise the vast majority of back - boned animals			2
@entity28 ( illustrated ) , described in the journal nature , brings scientists closer to understanding when modern jawed animals with backbones such as sharks and bony fishes emerged from a collection of jawed , armoured placoderms ' understanding their great success and the evolution of their anatomical marvels lies in reconstructing the nature of their most recent common ancestor			1
' an entrenched assumption of classical comparative anatomy , which has gained some recent palaeontological support , is this precursor resembled a shark			0
' @entity28 demands a major rethink of where fossils fit relative to modern lineages and how these living groups came to acquire their characteristic traits			0
' it will take time to fully digest the implications of such a remarkable fossil but it 's clear a major re-framing of our understanding of early gnathostome evolution is now in full swing			0
' @entity28 ( illustrated ) belonged to a group of early fish known as placoderms that had bony armour , or plates , on their heads and necks			2
@entity153 scientists believe it provides compelling evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and osteichthyans and adjusts our understanding of early evolution the first four - legged animals colonised land 400 million years ago after fish fins evolved into limbs allowing them to crawl out of the water			1
but it took them another 80 million years to lose their fishy heads			0
major changes to the jaw only began around 320 million years ago - occurring mostly in reptiles			0
the animals ' early fish - like jaws were suited to tearing flesh rather than chewing plants			2
it is believed that reptiles evolved their jaws only after they had mastered breathing using their ribs , allowing them to devote their mouths to chewing .			0

professor @entity76 , of the @entity77 , has discovered the fossil a new type of ancient fish called @entity28
it is believed the creature will help scientists understand when modern jawed animals with backbones - such as bony fish - emerged from placoderms
@entity153 scientists said the fossil challenges the view that the most recent common ancestor of jawed vertebrates resembled modern sharks
