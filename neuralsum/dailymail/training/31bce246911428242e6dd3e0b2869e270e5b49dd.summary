the @entity1 general who leads @entity3 's @entity2 warned tuesday that the @entity4 could face an unprecedented flood of immigrants from the south if the ebola virus epidemic hits @entity3			1
' if it breaks out , it 's literally , " @entity11 " , ' gen @entity9 told said during a public discussion at the @entity13			1
' and there will be mass migration into the @entity4			0
' ' they will run away from @entity17 , or if they suspect they are infected , they will try to get to the @entity4 for treatment			1
' the phrase ' @entity11 ' refers to a panic in response to a coming threat			2
it likely originated with an 1894 poem about an @entity30 girl 's family protecting their household from her drunkard husband			0
@entity9 also warned on tuesday that if the deadly disease should reach isolated , resource - poor countries in the @entity37 like @entity38 , it could devastate large populations before it 's brought to heel			1
@entity1 gen. @entity9 , commander of @entity2 , warned about the threat of @entity17 coming from south of the @entity4 border coming to @entity44 ? gen. @entity9 warned that an ebola outbreak south of the border would bring a new swell of humanity to the @entity4 seeking refuge and medical treatment @entity9 , a four - star @entity1 general ( shown here in july ) , is concerned that the @entity4 wo n't be able to contain @entity17 if it arrives via migrants instead of through airports ' by the end of the year , there 's supposed to be 1.4 million people infected with @entity17 and 62 percent of them dying , according to the @entity57 , ' he said			1
and there is no way we can keep @entity17 [ contained ] in @entity62			2
' and once it makes the large - scale jump over the @entity67 , he worried aloud , ' much like @entity62 , it will rage for a period of time			2
' making matters potentially worse , @entity9 warned that the same human trafficking networks responsible for bringing illegal immigrants northward through @entity73 could unwittingly pass @entity17 to the @entity4 through their human cargo			1
he accompanied @entity4 embassy personnel to visit the border between @entity77 and @entity78 , he recalled			2
they saw a group of men ' waiting in line to pass into @entity78 and then on their way north			0
' ' the embassy person walked over and asked who they were , ' @entity9 said , ' and they told him they were from @entity89 and they had been on the road about a week			2
' ' they met up with the network in @entity94 and now they were on their way to the @entity4 – illegally , of course			0
' those men , he told the military audience , ' could have made it to @entity102 and still be within the incubation period for @entity17			0
' ebola patients can carry the disease for a week or more before symptoms show and they become capable of easily transmitting the disease to others			0
the illness has killed 3,439 people in west africa this year , according to the @entity112			0
the first @entity4 patient , a @entity89 man who developed symptoms after reaching @entity44 on a trip to marry his girlfriend , died wednesday morning			1
illegal immigrant trafficking is already a booming business in @entity73 despite the chance of being apprehended , and this could leave the @entity4 open to new sources of @entity17 first of many ? @entity122 became the first @entity4 @entity17 victim to perish from the disease on wednesday morning the @entity125 noted wednesday that gen. @entity9 warned this year about the dangers associated with a loose @entity4 border to the south			1
budgets cuts , he said in a spring congressional hearing , are ' severely degrading ' his @entity134 task force 's ability to stem the flow of illegal immigration			0
nearly 75 per cent of traffickers , he said , are left unchallenged			0
' i simply sit and watch it go by , ' @entity9 told lawmakers			0
' all this corruption and violence is directly or indirectly due to the insatiable @entity143 for drugs , particularly cocaine , heroin and now methamphetamines , ” @entity9 told the @entity149 website in july , ' all of which are produced in @entity151 and smuggled into the @entity4 along an incredibly efficient network along which anything – hundreds of tons of drugs , people , terrorists , potentially weapons of mass destruction or children – can travel , so long as they can pay the fare			1

gen. @entity9 said @entity17 in countries like @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 would bring a new human flood to the @entity4 - @entity73 border
' @entity11 ' refers to a frantic effort to stop a threat from reaching its target
@entity9 recalled seeing a line of people waiting to cross a @entity3 border , all of whom said they were from @entity89
illegal immigrants have *poured* into the @entity4 from those countries this year , *including* tens of *thousands* of *unaccompanied* children
@entity9 predicted that the deadly disease ca n't be prevented from spreading : ' there is no way we can keep @entity17 in @entity62 '
