by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , 37 , from @entity3 in @entity4 is the proud mother of two adorable little girls , @entity6 , three , and @entity7 , six months			1
but while she and husband @entity10 , 42 , appear to have the perfect family , their happy smiles do n't tell the whole story			2
for while @entity7 is developing normally , her older sister @entity6 has @entity14 [ @entity15 ] , a genetic condition so rare , there are only 1,000 confirmed sufferers worldwide			1
happy family : @entity2 with her husband @entity10 and daughters @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) adorable : @entity6 loves nothing more than a day out in the park with her parents and sister as a result , @entity2 and @entity10 had never even heard of @entity15 , which is caused when genes that are part of chromosome 22 either do n't develop or are deleted			1
' we were shocked and upset , ' says @entity2 of the moment she first learned of her daughter 's diagnosis , ' but we did n't really understand what it meant			1
' we did n't know anything about genetics or anyone who had a genetic condition			2
but then we looked it up on the internet and got as much information as possible			0
' @entity10 and i feel that getting as much information that you can get is the best thing to do			0
it was a big shock but it gave us some idea of what we were dealing with			0
' quite what she is dealing with remains virtually unknown , with much still waiting to be discovered about the disorder - not least how long sufferers can expect to live			0
what is certain is that between 97 and 99 per cent of children born with the disorder will never speak , while the ability to walk develops at an unusually slow pace			1
unsurprisingly , this is something that weighs heavily on @entity2 's mind			1
' i think it 's the not knowing , the uncertainty that is the worst part			0
' it 's the thought of @entity6 never having any speech at all			1
also the thought of her never being able to do anything for herself			0
we 're very aware that @entity6 is probably going to live with us forever			2
' @entity73 , whom her mother describes as a ' happy and healthy little girl ' , currently spends her days at nursery or going for walks in the park with her parents like any other child			0
hard : @entity6 's condition had nothing to do with her parents and is a natural phenomenon that is rarely seen and @entity2 also hopes she will one day go to school as well as learning how to do things like feeding herself and walking on her own two feet			1
but for now , the focus is on making sure @entity6 is happy and living as normal a life as possible , although @entity2 does worry about how some people might react to her			1
' i 'd like to think that people have gone beyond [ discriminating against disabled people ] but they are always going to stare because @entity6 's different , ' she says , tentatively			1
' i do n't think she looks very different but if you watch her for any amount of time , you can see that she is different			0
' children , however , have proved considerably more accepting and @entity2 says that being around other infants at nursery has proved hugely beneficial			2
' nursery has been brilliant for @entity6 and seeing other children running around has just been positive , ' she smiles			2
' as @entity7 gets bigger , that will be brilliant for @entity6 as well			2
' @entity2 says @entity6 's illness has also helped to bring her family closer together , not least because of the prolonged crying fits that she , like the majority of those with @entity15 , suffers			1
sign up : @entity108 day takes place on the 19th september and raises money for children like @entity6 on the job : @entity114 and @entity115 gymnast has also gotten behind the campaign ' although @entity6 is happy 99 per cent of the time , sometimes , she does wake up in the night and she will be screaming for hours and there 's nothing we can do , ' says @entity2			1
' you know , you 've got to support each other through things like that and through difficult times together			0
' it 's made me a different person but for the better , ' she continues			0
' it 's opened my eyes to a lot of things and i think it 's made us closer and it has made us stronger			0
' while @entity2 is positive about @entity6 's condition and says she will always love her daughter regardless , her biggest hope now is that scientists will find a cure			1
' if i could have anything in the world , it would be that @entity6 did n't have it , ' she confesses			2
' they [ scientists ] are doing studies all the time but i 'm not sure i 'll see a cure in my lifetime			0
' in the absence of a cure , @entity2 says she hopes , at the very least , that @entity6 will manage to develop some speech and say the thing she most wants to hear : the word ' mum '			1
' never hearing her call us @entity159 and @entity160 is something i miss , ' admits @entity2			2
' it 's things like that that people take for granted			0
' i would love for her just to have a little bit of speech and to be able to communicate properly			0
' most of all , however , @entity2 just wants @entity6 to be happy and healthy			1
' even though she 's got @entity15 and lots of other children with it have things like seizures , she is healthy , ' she explains			0
' i just want her to be healthy and make progress - no matter how slow it is			0
' @entity2 and @entity6 are supporting @entity175 on friday 19th september			1

@entity2 's daughter @entity6 , three , has @entity14
condition is so rare , there are just 1,000 confirmed cases worldwide
those with the disorder are unlikely to ever speak or care for themselves
@entity2 says her biggest hope is a cure but priority is for @entity6 to be happy
