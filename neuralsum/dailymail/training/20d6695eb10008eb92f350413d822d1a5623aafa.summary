@entity0 has questioned the nomination of former drugs cheat @entity3 as one of the @entity6 's athletes of the year and said he is convinced by research that steroid users can benefit from usage long after they are declared ' clean '			1
new findings from the @entity11 states athletes who take anabolic steroids can retain the advantage of muscle development even decades later			1
@entity3 , from the @entity16 , has run the three fastest times this year in the 100 metres , and the fastest times in the 100 metres and 200 metres ever by a man in his 30s			1
@entity6 vice-president @entity0 has questioned @entity3 's nomination for the @entity22 of the year the 32 - year - old 2004 @entity24 100m champion @entity3 tested positive in 2006 for excess testosterone and was banned for four years until 2010			1
@entity3 's nomination last weekend as one of the @entity6 's male athletes saw another nominee , @entity30 's @entity24 discus champion @entity29 , asking for his own name to be removed			1
@entity0 , an @entity6 vice-president said he also had ' big problems ' with the nomination			1
speaking at the @entity35 conference in @entity36 he said : ' the only thing i would say is that he is entitled to be competing			2
i 'm not particularly comfortable about it			0
i think you 'd be pretty surprised if i did sit here and was sanguine about that			0
' i personally have big problems with that			0
@entity3 ( left ) powers ahead during the @entity47 meeting at @entity48 in july ' i have long since believed that , particularly anabolic steroids , but performance - enhancing , muscle - developing drugs , have a long - term effect			1
' i do n't wish to be dismissive about the @entity54 research but i think anybody in the last 20 years that i 've known in that world , particularly in sports physiology and biochemistry would tell you that 's certainly the case			1
' the effect is certainly not transient and we 've seen that in the performance of athletes for some time			0
' @entity0 is also chairman of the @entity66 but he accepted there was no going back to the days of its lifetime ban for drugs cheats			1
@entity3 ( right ) attempts to chase down @entity71 as the @entity16 claimed bronze at @entity73 ' i recognise legally and for all sorts of reasons that that particular train has left the station , ' he said			2
' a life ban , we know from all sorts of challenges , ca n't be upheld			0
' we pushed very hard within the @entity6 to get the @entity83 ban from two years back up to four years			2
' i do think sanctions do have to take into consideration the extended effect that anabolic steroids , performance - enhancing drugs , can have on a career even when the athlete is ' clean '			1
' @entity0 added that he will stand for the presidency of the @entity6 next year - current incumbent @entity92 has said he will step down			1
@entity0 said : ' i 've always been clear , if i 'm given the opportunity to shape the future of my sport , i will certainly take it			2
' if there is a presidential election , i will want to stand for that			0
' professor of physiology at the @entity11 @entity102 and his team studied the effect of steroids on mice and believes that the same mechanism is at work in human muscles and that other performance - enhancing drugs would have similar long - term effects			1
gatlin in 2006 , the year he was was banned for a maximum of eight years by the @entity114 @entity102 told @entity115 : ' i would be very surprised if there were any major differences between humans and mice in this context			2
' the fundamental biology of muscle growth is similar in humans and in mice , and in principle any drug that builds muscle mass could trigger this mechanism			0
' i think it is likely that effects could be lifelong or at least lasting decades in humans			2
our data indicates the exclusion time of two years is far too short			0
even four years is too short			0
' thirty - two - year - old @entity133 served a four - year ban after appeal to arbitration and - after his return to the sport in 2010 - he ran the fastest 100 metres in the world in this year as he clocked 9.77 seconds to claim a dominant victory at the @entity141 in @entity142 last month			1
@entity143 ( centre ) says @entity3 's phenomenal times this year suggest the steroids he took still have an effect but @entity149 400 metres hurdles champion @entity143 said : ' he 's over the hill as far as sprinting is concerned - he should never be running these times for the 100m and 200m			1
' but he 's still doing it , and you have to look at his past , and ask how it is still affecting him now , because the average person would n't be able to do that			2
' those are incredible performances			0
not many people have run that fast separately , ever			0
to do it on a damp friday night ? i could n't believe those times			0
' it shows one of two things : either he 's still taking performance - enhancing drugs to get the best out of him at his advanced age , or the ones he did take are still doing a fantastic job			1
' because there is no way he can still be running that well at this late point in his career			0
@entity3 celebrates winning the men 's 100m sprint in @entity183 , @entity184 in september to continue his superb year ' after having years on the sidelines , being unable to train or compete , it does n't really add up			1
9.77 is an incredibly fast time			0
you only have to look at his performances			0
i do n't believe in them			0
' the new data casts a further shadow over formerly - banned athletes such as @entity3 , his compatriot @entity196 and @entity149 's @entity197			1
in his defence , @entity3 's agent @entity198 said : ' @entity3 would have run these times , and faster , had his over-zealous ( former ) coach @entity201 not tried to get him there sooner than he would 've naturally gotten there			1
' so , what @entity3 is doing right now , i 'm not surprised by that			2
' his body is rested for four years , so he was n't racing			0
and he was the talent that i always knew he was			0
' hear more on 5live @entity208 , tuesday 7 october , 20.30 - 22.00			2

@entity3 nominated for @entity6 athlete of the year
@entity0 *uneasy* about nomination considering new research
@entity11 research shows effects of steroids can be long - lasting
@entity3 was banned for taking drugs in 2006 but is in *excellent* form and has ran the fastest 100 metres in the world this year
@entity143 says @entity3 's current speed supports the new *hypothesis*
