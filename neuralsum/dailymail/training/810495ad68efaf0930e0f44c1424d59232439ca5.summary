by @entity0 when @entity2 put her three - bed country home up for sale in 2004 , she expected no trouble at all finding a buyer			1
she thought someone , perhaps a retired couple looking for some solitude , or a young family looking to escape the rat race , would soon meet the £ 175,000 asking price for the well - kept and charming rural retreat in the sleepy @entity16 village of @entity17			1
but after 10 years on the market , mrs @entity2 and her husband @entity18 , 41 , are still in the home - and believe potential buyers are put off because it is so rural that it has no mobile signal and very slow broadband speed			1
idyll : but the three - bed country home in a sleepy @entity16 village has had hardly any interest in the decade it 's been for sale the owners believe buyers are put off by the lack of infrastructure in the countryside - it is five miles from the nearest town the couple , who have a nine - year - old son called @entity42 , believe their home , located on the edge of the @entity45 in @entity46 , must hold the @entity48 record for a house that has been on the market for the longest time			1
they have had the old village post office repainted and decorated and it has parking and a back garden - but it also overlooks a graveyard which could also be putting people off			1
the mother - of - one is desperate to move closer to her relatives - more than 250 miles away in the @entity59 of @entity60			2
and she admits she might have to slash the asking price again in a bid to finally sell the house - - which at times has been priced as low as £ 163,000			1
in 2004 the house went on the market for £ 175,000 , falling to £ 163,000 in around 2007			0
by 2011 as the housing market recovered the price was back up to £ 167,500 and is now on sale for £ 175,000 again			0
a property expert said it is unheard of for a house to be on the market for a decade the owners refitted the bathroom and kitchen , installed double glazing and enhanced the central heating in a bid to sell still on the market : the asking price for the @entity2 's @entity16 home @entity2 , a marketing executive , said : ' the property has barely generated a flicker of interest since it first went on the market			1
' we believe it is a perfect country getaway			0
but rather than helping to generate interest , the property ’s rural location is putting people off			2
' @entity2 and her husband moved to the house - called the @entity91 - after inheriting it from his parents			2
the house had ' chronic damp ' but is now in ' @entity97 ' after the couple overhauled it			0

they believe buyers are put off by the lack of infrastructure in the countryside			1
the house had ' chronic damp ' but is now in ' @entity97 ' after the couple overhauled it the house is five miles from the nearest town , has ' patchy and unreliable ' mobile phone signal and the broadband speed is around 15 times lower than the @entity48 average			0
housing experts said they are baffled by the lack of a buyer for the house			2
@entity122 , spokesman for the @entity123 , said : ' ten years would have to be a record			0
' in the last recession it would n’t have been uncommon for a house to have been on for two or three years but that was because of the economy			0
' but it is unheard of for a house to be on the market for a decade			0

the three - bed home in the @entity16 village of @entity17 has yet to be bought
the owners worry that *remoteness* and lack of infrastructure puts off buyers
a property expert is amazed at the home 's long - term failure to sell
