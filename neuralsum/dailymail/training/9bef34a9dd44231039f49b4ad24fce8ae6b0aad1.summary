by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 4 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:41 est , 4 december 2013 @entity5 correspondent @entity4 's return to @entity6 has been pushed back from the previously announced date as the network was side - lined by the sudden announcement that their weather anchor would be leaving the show just days later			1
@entity4 has been off the air since discovering via a televised mammogram that she had breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes			1
she had a double mastectomy and 13 lymph nodes removed , and sent a grateful email out to colleagues on november 22 announcing that she would be back on the small screen on december 2			1
all smiles : @entity4 , seen here on wednesday , had a successful operation to remove the cancer and has told how it will be a long recovery process but she has yet to appear back on tv high spirits : @entity4 said that while the disease has taken an emotional toll on her , she is determined to live to see her young children grow up and get back to work support : she tweeted this photo of she and champion in the @entity6 studios shortly after @entity5 ended on wednesday that never happened as she did not appear on monday 's broadcast nor has she been seen on the program this week - even though she has been in @entity6 studios			1
instead , the @entity5 staff had to deal with a surprise departure as well as her planned return as it was revealed this weekend that longtime weatherman @entity35 was leaving the network and headed to @entity47 to launch his own flagship morning show			1
the news of @entity51 's departure only broke over the weekend and his last day on the news program was this morning			0
@entity6 press representatives refused to comment on the timing of @entity4 's return in relation to @entity35 's sudden departure , only reiterating how well she is doing			1
@entity4 made that point herself as she was pictured smiling as she entered the @entity60 offices of @entity6 this morning			1
she followed that with a photo of her own - posting a picture of her hugging champion behind the scenes this morning with a shirtless cardboard cutout of him in the background			0
last day : @entity35 is leaving @entity6 after 25 years with the network and heading up a new show on @entity47 @entity69 faces : the cast dedicated much of the last week to celebrating their departing comrade , never mentioning the fact that the return date for @entity4 has been pushed back - and not for health reasons ' i love @ samchampion soooo much ... especially his hot bod ! # missualready , ' she posted at 9.29am @entity80 time			1
much of @entity5 on wednesday was dedicated to @entity51 , with tributes , highlight reels and even the unveiling of a 100 - square - foot mosaic of his face made entirely of marshmallows			1
october 1 : in front of millions of viewers , a hesitant @entity4 undergoes her first mammogram as part of @entity5 's @entity93 campaign			1
host @entity94 , who is a breast cancer survivor herself , urged the 40 - year - old correspondent to have the test			2
october 30 : @entity4 goes back to the doctor 's office for further tests where they confirmed that she had two tumors in one breast , abnormal cells in the other and 13 cancerous lymph nodes			2
november 14 : she underwent a bilateral mastectomy			0
they were able to save her nipples and doctors inserted expanders behind her chest muscle to stretch the area before inserting implants in a few months with a second surgery			0
november 22 : @entity4 writes an emotional and upbeat memo to @entity6 staffers saying she is ' excited ' to be back at work on december 2			1
the weekend of november 30 and december 1 : news that @entity35 will be leaving @entity6 to work at @entity47			1
december 2 : champion and the @entity5 co-hosts confirm the news during the show , lavishing him with praise and wishing him the best			1
@entity4 does not appear on air			2
december 4 : champion 's last day is celebrated throughout the program			0
@entity4 tweets a photo of she and @entity51 hugging backstage			0
the spectacle for @entity51 was thrown together over the weekend , and was publicly announced on @entity5 on monday where his co-hosts lathered him with praise			2
the effusive send off appears to be @entity6 's attempt to have the complete opposite situation that rival program @entity135 faced when one of their co-hosts , @entity136 , left the show under significantly more tense circumstances			2
in their efforts to make sure that @entity51 - and viewers - felt loved as he left , they effectively over shadowed the return of @entity4			2
on november 22 , she wrote a memo to @entity6 staff proclaiming that while she had ' been through the ringer ' with her cancer treatment , she was excited to return			1
' as of right now , i plan to head back into the building monday , december 2nd and i could nâ€™t be more excited to get back to work , ' she wrote in the email			0
that never ended up happening and she has not made an appearance on the air at all this week			0
media insiders are not the only ones noticing , as a number of @entity4 's @entity159 followers responded to her photo this morning			0
' how are you @entity4			0
i thought @entity5 would give us an update , ' a woman named @entity163 wrote			0
' so nice to see you			0
hope you are back on the air soon , ' another user wrote			0
the last - minute side - lining of @entity4 becomes even more pointed as this week 's issue of @entity170 begins to hit newsstands today , with the mom - of - five on the cover			2
under normal circumstances , @entity5 would have likely done a segment welcoming her back and tying it into the publication of her cover story .			0
