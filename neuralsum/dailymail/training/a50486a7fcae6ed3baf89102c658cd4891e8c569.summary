by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 5 september 2013 conjoined twins who shared spinal cords have successfully been separated during a gruelling eighteen - hour operation			1
the operation on one - year - old @entity6 sisters @entity7 and @entity8 involved 40 doctors , and is only the fourth such separation to be carried out in the world			1
the pair , who were born with a condition called pygopagus in @entity15 , @entity6 , were joined at the hip and had spinal cord fusion , while also sharing a lower gastrointestinal passage and genitalia			1
they are pictured after the operation with their parents , @entity28 and @entity29 specialist surgeons at @entity31 in @entity24 , @entity32 , conducted the separation on august 12			1
they carried out two procedures - one to divide the twins , and one reconstructive operation			1
the procedures - which cost an estimated £ 64,000 and were paid for by a @entity6 philanthropist - were so risky that doctors were forced to conduct practice runs on dummies before attempting it for real			2
dr @entity43 , the paediatric surgeon who led the team , said : ‘ the separation of the @entity22 twins was a big challenge as they had unusual sharing of alimentary canal , genitourinary system and nervous system			2
‘ we overcame this with meticulous planning and team work			0
rehearsals were carried out using dummies			0
‘ every surgical step was defined and rehearsed over and over again till it reached precision			0
the operation on the sisters ( pictured before surgery ) involved 40 doctors , and is only the fourth such separation to be carried out in the world			1
the procedure was conducted at @entity31 ‘ the girls were colour coded , one pink and the other blue , for eight days before the surgery so that there would be no error at all			1
‘ all tubes , wires , catheters , leads , syringes , injections and drugs were also colour coded in accordance with the pink or blue code to avoid any error or miscalculation			0
’ head of anaesthesiology , dr @entity89 , added : ‘ the most difficult task in this surgery was the anaesthetist ’s job which was challenging by the fact that whatever drug was given to one twin , the other would receive it inadvertently through a large sharing vein therefore it needed to be calculated and monitored carefully			0

scan shows the twins before their operation he procedures - which cost an estimated £ 64,000 and were paid for by a @entity6 philanthropist - were so risky that doctors were forced to conduct practice runs on dummies for the girls ’ parents , father @entity8 , and mother @entity29 , it was the culmination of a long process to save their daughters			1
after the babies were born in @entity121 , @entity15 , last year , they sought the help of local doctors to separate their twins			2
but the diagnosis was simple - one of the girls would have to be sacrificed to save the other in order to carry out the separation surgery			0
the girls ( pictured before their operation ) were born in @entity121 , @entity6 , last year , but doctors in @entity6 felt they would be unable to separate them without sacrificing one of the twins dr @entity43 , the paediatric surgeon who led the team , said that every step of the operation was practiced in advance			2
image shows the twins and their parents after the operation desperate to save both their girls , they sought one last opinion , and were referred to @entity24 , where the chance of both surviving was deemed far greater			1
the twins were taken to @entity31 , and after multiple evaluations their extreme case was identified as them sharing spinal cords , a lower intestinal tract and a urinary tract			2
their treatment was split into three stages			0

@entity8 is pictured with her mother , @entity29 ( left ) and @entity166 is pictured with her father , @entity28 ( right ) the first , on may 25 , used tissue expanders made from silicon implanted in their bottoms to generate enough tissue to cover the wound made in surgery			2
the second - and most crucial - was performed on august 12 with doctors physically separating the twins before plastic surgeons carried out extensive reconstructive procedures			1
the third stage is due to take place in three weeks ’ time and will involve closing the temporary stool passage of both girls			0
@entity185 conjoined twins are joined at the posterior - or rump			0
they account for about 19 per cent of conjoined twins			0
they usually have separate hearts but share a spinal cord			0
they also have one anus , two rectums , four arms and four legs .			0
