nearly 120 wind turbines catch fire each year , according to new research - ten times the number reported by the industry			1
the figures , compiled by engineers at @entity8 and the @entity9 , make fire the second - largest cause of accidents after blade failure			1
the researchers claim that out of 200,000 turbines around the world , 117 fires take place annually - far more than the 12 reported by wind farm companies			1
here , a turbine in @entity22 , @entity23 , catches fire during severe weather fire has a huge financial impact on the industry , the researchers report in the journal @entity31			2
each wind turbine costs more than £ 2 million and generates an estimated income of more than £ 500,000 per year			0
any loss or downtime of these valuable assets makes the industry less viable and productive			0
dr @entity38 of @entity8 ’s department of mechanical engineering , said : ‘ fires are a problem for the industry , impacting on energy production , economic output and emitting toxic fumes			1
‘ this could cast a shadow over the industry ’s green credentials			0
‘ worryingly our report shows that fire may be a bigger problem than what is currently reported			1
our research outlines a number of strategies that can be adopted by the industry to make these turbines safer and more fire resistant in the future			1
’ wind turbines catch fire because highly flammable materials such as hydraulic oil and plastics are in close proximity to machinery and electrical wires			1
these can ignite a fire if they overheat or are faulty			0
lots of oxygen , in the form of high winds , can quickly fan a fire inside a turbine , the paper found			0
it contradicts the findings of a report into the wind industry , commissioned by the @entity86 in 2013 , which concluded that the safety risks associated with wind turbines are very low			2
the wind industry last night questioned the validity of the new research			0
@entity93 , of @entity94 which represents wind firms , said : ‘ the industry would challenge a number of the assumptions made in the report , including the questionable reliability of the data sources and a failure to understand the safety and integrity standards for fire safety that are standard practice in any large wind turbine			2
‘ wind turbines are designed to international standards to meet mandatory health and safety standards including fire safety risks			0
‘ the industry remains committed to promoting a safe environment for its workers and the public , and no member of the public has ever been injured by a wind turbine in the @entity94			0
