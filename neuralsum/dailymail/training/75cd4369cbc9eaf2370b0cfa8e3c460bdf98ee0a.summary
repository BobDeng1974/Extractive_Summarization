by @entity0 published : 03:34 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 05:15 est , 24 august 2012 wonky carrots , stunted parsnips and imperfect apples will all make a return to supermarket shelves after @entity7 's dismal weather conditions affected this year 's harvest			1
shoppers are used to browsing the aisles for strawberries , cucumbers and carrots that look just as good as they taste			0
but the wettest june on record , a cool july , and hail storms in august have all taken a toll on @entity7 's fruit and vegetables - prompting retailers to relax their rules on the cosmetic standards for produce			1
not so pretty parsnips : misshapen vegetables like these gnarled parsnips could soon be appearing on supermarket shelves as a result of the poor harvest the move comes after farmers urged retailers not to waste perfectly tasty fresh produce because of a few blemishes or an unusual shape			1
@entity36 rules on misshapen fruit and veg were relaxed in 2009 but supermarkets still maintain private product standards			1
the @entity41 has said its members were already struggling to cope with below average yields this year			1
in june apple growers told how their orchards had been blighted by frost , rain and hailstorms , meaning the year 's crop would be dramatically reduced			0
fruit farmers in the @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 and parts of the @entity55 said they had lost as much as 65 per cent of their harvest			2
in july - traditionally peak season for potatoes - farmers reported that they had lost 40 per cent of their potato crop because of waterlogged fields			2
if supermarkets were to reject what produce has survived , it could push some farmers out of business , according to the @entity41			1
wonky : fruit and vegetables that are the ' wrong ' shape are just as tasty as the more aesthetically pleasing versions ' the @entity41 has been calling on supermarkets to relax their standards because we do not want perfectly good fruit and vegetables rejected , ' said @entity77 , a horticulture adviser at the union			1
' common sense should be applied , ' he told the @entity81			0
small marks on the skin of fruits do not affect their flavour , but supermarkets will often reject blemished produce			0
retailers also insist on vegetables meeting certain size standards , despite the fact that a small carrot will taste just as good as a larger one			0
this year major supermarkets @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 's have all pledged to sell more fruit and veg that previously would have been dumped for failing to meet cosmetic standards			2
but author @entity101 , who campaigns against food wastage , said a one - off relaxation of rules in response to the poor harvest was not enough			1
he has said farmers are routinely forced to throw away up to 40 per cent of a crop because it is not aesthetically pleasing enough			0
according to mr @entity101 , founder of the feeding the 5,000 campaign , when the harvest returns to normal farmers will again be forced to dump produce			2
misshapen : in 2009 the @entity36 relaxed rules governing the cosmetic appearance of fruit and veg in 2009 the @entity36 announced it was to repeal specific marketing standards for 26 different types of fruit and vegetables , including asparagus , aubergines , sprouts , cabbage , melons and courgettes			2
the change effectively meant that member states could permit the sale of all fruit and vegetables - regardless of their size and shape			0
specific marketing standards remained in place for apples , citrus fruit , kiwis , lettuce , peaches , nectarines , pears , strawberries , sweet peppers , grapes and tomatoes			0
but the change meant @entity36 countries could still allow retailers to stock fruit and veg that failed to meet the standards if they labelled items appropriately .			0

supermarkets to relax *restrictions* on ' ugly ' fruit and veg after wet weather takes a toll on the @entity7 harvest
below average yields mean rejecting ' *outgrade* ' produce could force some farmers out of business , says @entity41
*anti-waste* campaigners say a one - off relaxation of the rules is not enough
