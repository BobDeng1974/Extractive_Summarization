the families of three @entity2 schoolgirls thought to be in @entity3 have travelled to @entity4 to retrace their steps			1
school friends @entity7 , 15 , @entity8 , 16 , and @entity9 , 15 , left east @entity2 for @entity4 last month before crossing into an @entity11 - controlled area of @entity3			1
the @entity13 pupils are feared to have reached the conflict zone to become so - called ' jihadi brides ' with @entity11			1
there they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in			2
he told @entity37 they were ' smiling as they arrived ' and ' smiling as they left '			0
@entity39 , sister of @entity7 , told @entity37 : ' this is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we 've followed them all the way out here			1
we want them to know that we love them			0
' @entity49 , sister of @entity8 , said : ' i do n't really recognise my sister , the video and the cctv that we saw			2
because this is just not her and we just want to understand her , you know , to find some answers and get some help			0
' @entity59 , father of @entity9 , said : ' i do n't know how to explain			2
i ca n't describe my feelings			0
i feel like my girl is next to me when i find someone that 's on their last journey who saw them			0
i feel like my daughter is next to me - that 's the feelings i have			0
' searching for clues : at the bus station , the family spoke to a man who unknowingly let the three girls in tears : the families struggle to hide their emotions as they retraced the steps of the @entity2 schoolgirls the families left through the same door as the girls at the bus station , and family lawyer @entity86 said : ' of course they feel responsible for their own children , that goes without saying			1
' but the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school			0
police put a cap on information that they and the school were giving back to the parents			0
' the east @entity2 schoolgirls flew to @entity25 from @entity100 with @entity101 and now believed to be in based in the @entity3 town of @entity103 â€“ the @entity105 's self - declared capital			1
last week it emerged that @entity107 , 15 , a close friend of the trio and a fellow pupil at @entity13 , left @entity110 before them in december			2
there are suspicions the trio kept in touch with @entity107 who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps			0
those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by @entity121 using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software			0
the families have criticised police and others for failing to stop them			1
but their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical @entity121			0
@entity133 chief sir @entity132 has said the three schoolgirls would not face prosecution if they returned home			0
familiar route : the families , along with @entity37 's @entity138 , flew in to @entity25 from @entity100 looking for answers : by retracing the route of the schoolgirls , the families hope it might bring them home elsewhere last week , three @entity110 teenage jihadists were placed in custody after a dramatic security operation prevented them joining @entity11 in @entity3			1
a pair of 17 - year - old schoolboys and a 19 - year - old man , all from @entity2 , were intercepted in @entity4 after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group			1
they dialled 999 and @entity110 police quickly tipped off their @entity4 counterparts			1
officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in @entity25			0
security services say 600 @entity110 @entity160 have gone to fight in @entity3 and around 60 of them are young women			2
they include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months , many of whom wanted to become ' jihadi brides '			1
@entity11 currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the @entity110 , from @entity169 to central @entity170 , and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause			2
@entity4 has faced criticism for not controlling its border with @entity3 , but has accused @entity176 states of failing to prevent would - be jihadists from leaving in the first place .			1
