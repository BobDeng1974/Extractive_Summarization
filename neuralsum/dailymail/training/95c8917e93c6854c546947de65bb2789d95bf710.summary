@entity0 decided to take the plunge by dispensing of the services of @entity3 in midweek after a poor run of results			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are among the names said to be on @entity0 's potential shortlist to take over the reins at @entity12			1
here , @entity13 of 90min.com suggests who he would want to replace @entity3			1
so the inevitable has happened , @entity3 is gone and @entity0 are in the bottom three			1
for many of us , both of these scenarios were spotted a mile off , so why has it taken until now for the club to act ? looking through the potential candidates to replace him does not make for pleasing reading			2
in fact , it probably demonstrates how far we 've fallen since those heady days with @entity28 in charge , when we entertained the nation with our flying wingers and a genuine intent to bash the door down on a slightly different looking top four			2
the shortlist drawn up by many is a collection of the cringeworthy ( @entity6 , @entity8 ) , the unproven ( @entity7 , @entity39 ) and the washed - up ( @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity8 - again ) , while @entity43 's departure from @entity44 last year left a skid - mark on a promising reputation on these shores			1
@entity3 was sacked on wednesday night after failing to steer @entity0 away from the relegation zone @entity49 and @entity50 are working wonders at @entity52 and @entity53 respectively there are no stand - outs			1
in reality , the most attractive names are those currently contracted to @entity60 clubs : @entity50 , @entity49 and , to a lesser extent , @entity62			0
had @entity3 gone a few months back , during the first of two shamefully barren spells in front of goal , when we were merely on the cusp of our slide towards the bottom half of the table - nevermind the bottom three - maybe we could have thought more long - term about his replacement			2
the likes of @entity50 and @entity49 , who 've implemented successful , attacking styles to enable swift , yet steady progression at their respective clubs ( @entity53 and @entity52 ) , would have perhaps been ideal at the time			0
both are renowned for getting the best out of what they 've got			0
indeed , eight of the 14 @entity53 players to feature against @entity52 on tuesday played in the @entity85 ' 0 - 0 draw at @entity86 22 months ago , which secured their promotion as @entity88 runners - up			0
while @entity49 has managed to coax a goal every 44 minutes out of our very own @entity91 since january - albeit in the second tier			0
@entity49 has been able to get the best out of @entity0 striker @entity91 during the striker 's loan spell at @entity52 @entity0 have struggled since @entity28 decided to resign from his role at the club in august 2010 the trouble is that neither are going to abandon their current projects to rescue @entity0 from the clutches of the division they 're both so close to escaping			1
it would be like leaving your high - paid job as @entity108 director in favour of a similar role at @entity111 , circa			0
the sun probably set on our top - four hopes when we lost @entity28 and mr. @entity115 stopped dipping his hands in his pocket			0
losing @entity118 that same summer was also a sign of things to come in the transfer market , but as @entity123 proved last season , you do n't always need vast coffers or big - name players to challenge at the right end of the table			2
instead , a successful philosophy with a sprinkling of spirit			0
i 'd be surprised if @entity3 's departure did n't coincide with @entity0 scoring goals again , such has been the boulder - like weight on the players ' shoulders these last few months , but that said , this appointment has to be right for us going forward			1
@entity50 and @entity49 tick my boxes , but we may have to survive first			0
