he said : ‘ @entity2 played an absolutely vital role in our war effort			1
one of the things i was very proud to do as prime minister was to make sure the people who served in @entity2 got proper recognition with a new clasp on their medals			0
allied bombing raids on @entity19 left 25,000 civilians dead in 1945 and razed much of the city to the ground ‘ and it was a great honour to hand out some of those medals to people who have waited for many , many years for the recognition i think they deserve			1
