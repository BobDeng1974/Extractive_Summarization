@entity65 - @entity6 journalist @entity64 suffered a brutal sexual and physical assault inside @entity14 ’s interior ministry last november , the same month a @entity69 journalist said she had been beaten and sexually assaulted while covering the protests			1
here , in extracts from her blog , @entity7 describes in terrifying detail what happened			1
by natasha smith the atmosphere was one of jubilation , excitement , and happiness as i walked , accompanied by two male companions for safety , along @entity83			1
women , children and fathers smiled , waved , and cheered happily at my video camera			1
fireworks lit up the sky			1
as i reached the end of the bridge , i noticed the crowd became thicker , and decided immediately to turn around to avoid @entity13			1
my friends and i tried to leave			1
i tried to put my camera back in my rucksack			1
but in a split second , everything changed			1
i found myself being dragged from my male friends , groped all over , with increasing force and aggression			1
i could see what was happening and i saw that i was powerless to stop it			2
rammed : crowds in @entity14 's @entity13 , a focus point for the @entity106 , where the attack happened my friend @entity108 did everything he could to hold on to me			1
but it was no use			2
hundreds of men were dragging me away , kicking and @entity114 camera was snatched from my grasp			1
my rucksack was torn from my back – it was so crowded that i did n’t even feel it			2
men began to rip off my clothes			1
their insatiable appetite to hurt me heightened			2
these men , hundreds of them , had turned from humans to animals			1
hundreds of men pulled my limbs apart and threw me around			1
they were scratching and clenching my breasts and forcing their fingers inside me in every possible way			2
all i could see was leering faces , more and more faces sneering and jeering as i was tossed around like fresh meat among starving lions			1
@entity7 managed to escape after putting on a burka and pretending to be the wife of a local man a small minority of men , just a couple at first , tried to protect me and guide me to a tent			1
the tent was crushed , its contents scattered all over the ground			2
i was tossed around once more , being violated every second			1
i was dragged naked across the dirty ground			1
men pulled my blonde hair – a beacon of my alien identity			1
the men trying to protect me tried to guide me into another tent			1
i was able to scramble on to the ground			2
i sat with my back against a chair and surveyed the surging mob			2
although a few men tried to form a human shield around me , offering me rags to cover my bruised body , men were still able to touch me			1
there were just too many			2
i gazed around at the bared teeth and raging eyes			2
i was struggling to breathe			2
one man lifted a tent pole and attempted to strike me with it			2
at this point , i said aloud to myself , calmly , over and over : ‘ please @entity171			2
’ i ’m not religious			2
but at times of desperation , we all feel compelled to appeal to some higher power to save us			2
i began to think : ‘ maybe this is just it			2
maybe this is how i go , how i die			2
i hope it ’s quick			2
i hope i die before they rape me			2
’ i looked up and saw a couple of women in burkas scattered around			2
they looked at me blankly , then looked away			0
after five to ten minutes , my friend managed to convince people inside a medical tent to form a pathway through the crowd to guide me into the tent			0
during transit i was mauled and invaded			0
i reached the tent and saw my friend @entity108			0
@entity28 women surrounded me and frantically tried to cover my naked body			1
i fell to the ground and apparently temporarily lost consciousness			0
mixed : @entity13 was a scene of celebration , but also of a horror , as @entity7 was assaulted brutal : @entity7 was attacked as thousands celebrated the victory of the @entity28 's candidate as the new president the women told me the attack was motivated by rumours spread by trouble - making thugs that i was a foreign spy , following a national advertising campaign warning of the dangers of foreigners			1
but if that was the cause , it was only really used as a pretext , an excuse , to molest and violate a blonde , young @entity57 girl			0
the men outside remained thirsty for blood ; their prey had been cruelly snatched from their grasp			1
they peered in , so i had to duck down and hide			0
they attempted to attack the tent , and those inside began making a barricade out of chairs			0
women were crying and telling me : ‘ this is not @entity6 ! this is not @entity233 ! please , please do not think this is what @entity6 is ! ’ accidental leader : @entity27 waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally i reassured them that i knew that was the case			0
this vicious act was not representative of the place i had come to know and love			0
after much heated debate , it was decided that @entity108 and i would leave separately to avoid attracting attention			0
i was disguised in a burka and men ’s clothes and ordered to hold the hand of an @entity6 stranger who would pretend to be my husband			1
attacked : @entity60 reporter @entity59 moments before she was assaulted in february 2011 i was terrified but i could see it was the only way out			1
he pulled me through the crowds out of the back of the tent			0
he told me : ‘ do n’t cry			0
’ i was barefoot , dodging broken glass and debris , trawling through mud and dirt			0
my inner reserves of strength kicked in , and i stopped crying and just thought : ‘ keep calm and carry on			0
’ the man sat me down by the side of the road , still ordering me not to cry			0
eventually , his friends turned up , with @entity108			0
they explained that they could n’t take us to hospital since they might be arrested if they were seen with us			0
@entity108 and i went on our way			0
we eventually hailed a taxi			0
upon reaching a government hospital down town , we tried to explain the situation			0
i was eventually ushered into a small cubicle			0
two men asked : ‘ are you pregnant ? married ? a virgin ? ’ they seemed displeased by my response of ‘ no ’			1
i was refused examination and treatment			0
eventually i decided i ’d just have to check for damage myself			0
i went to the bathroom and could n’t believe the reflection			0
i was dirty , wounded , with hair like a tramp and eyes wide with shock			0
finally , i was taken home by my friends , and put to bed			0
i did n’t want to tell my family right away , as i knew it would destroy them			0
yesterday [ monday ] , i had a proper examination and darted around sorting things out , spending an eternity giving a police report			0
during the examination , which was carried out by a woman , i was crying and shaking			0
to have someone touch me so soon after the event was terrifying			0
broken and battered : @entity304 was brutally assaulted last year later , i could n’t bear to be around groups of @entity6 men			1
and when it got dark , i panicked , and could n’t bear to look any man in the eye			0
i clung to @entity108 all day			0
as we drove around @entity14 , i could n’t help but think : ‘ of all the people we ’ve driven past today , one of them must have been in that crowd of hundreds last night			0
’ i am determined to continue with my documentary at some point			0
[ it ] will be fuelled by my passion to help make people aware of just how serious this issue is , and that it ’s not just a passing news story that briefly gets people ’s attention then is forgotten			0
this is a consistent trend and it has to stop			0
@entity328 women , @entity57 women – there are so many sufferers			0
one of the worst things two nights ago was that i had never felt so powerless			0
i had no control and i was violated			0
but now i can take control and rebuild my confidence .			0
