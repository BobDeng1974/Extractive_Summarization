surgeons often describe the tricky operation to remove a brain tumour as ‘ trying to pluck a spider out of jelly ’			1
take out too little and the cancerous ‘ legs ’ remain and regrow – but take out too much and there is a risk of cutting away healthy tissue and leaving the patient disabled			1
now a @entity11 hospital is trialling a laser that bleeps like a parking sensor on a car when the scalpel gets to the edge of the cancerous areas , letting surgeons know their margins for error			1
in a world first , neurosurgeons at @entity22 ’s @entity21 have started using the pen - like probe , called the @entity26 , which shines a near - infrared light on to a tumour and scans for subtle differences between healthy and cancerous tissue			1
the device can read the differences in less than a second , and gives a warning sound if the surgeon is close to healthy tissue			0
about 16,000 @entity11 are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year , and more children and adults under 40 die from the condition than from any other cancer			1
there are more than 120 types			0
surgeons hope the @entity26 , which has already proved successful in skin - cancer surgery in @entity45 , will allow them to remove as much of the cancerous growth as possible and also speed up operating times			2
the probe was used for the first time during brain surgery at @entity51 last week as part of a trial that will involve 30 patients over the next year			1
senior neurosurgical trainee @entity55 , who spearheaded the project to bring the @entity26 to the @entity11 , says : ‘ there really is nothing like this at the moment			0
‘ brain surgery is a very complex operation – sometimes even taking just a millimetre too much can cause real damage , such as paralysis or problems with speech			0
having something that will make surgery safer and more accurate could be a real game - changer			0
’ one of the major obstacles at present is that the boundary between the tumour and healthy brain tissue is very hard to distinguish , even with an operating microscope			2
currently , surgeons must rely on taking several tiny cuttings of tissue to ensure they are only taking away that which is cancerous			2
it can take up to 90 minutes for these biopsies to be tested and for results to be fed back to surgeons , all while the patient remains in the operating theatre			0
surgeons believe the pen - like probe could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time ( picture posed by models ) instead of taking a physical sample , a surgeon holds the core over the area being operated on and a beam is emitted from the tip of the probe , scanning for changes in the chemical composition of brain tissue			1
a tumour molecule vibrates differently from healthy molecules under laser light , causing the light to bounce back in a different way			0
this is picked up by the probe , and the signal is then interpreted by a computer , giving an instant reading of whether the tissue is cancerous			2
mr @entity55 believes using the @entity26 could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time			1
‘ having a device that takes less than a second to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue means we could potentially avoid taking unnecessary biopsies , and also perform more surgeries in a day , ’ he says			1
the @entity26 ’s makers , @entity45 company @entity121 , hopes the work at @entity51 will replicate the success of a similar trial used to detect skin cancer on 1,000 patients at a hospital in @entity128			0
the @entity51 trial is being part - funded by charity @entity130 , which claims research into diagnostics and treatment is ‘ woefully underfunded ’			0
founder @entity134 says : ‘ taking away healthy tissue can have disastrous consequences , so this probe is hugely exciting			0

@entity11 surgeons use pen - like probe to spot brain tumours for the first time
laser helps *medics* tell difference between healthy and cancerous tissue
*pioneering* *technique* could shave 30 minutes off three - hour operations
