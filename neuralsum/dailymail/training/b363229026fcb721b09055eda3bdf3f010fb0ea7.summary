@entity0 , released by @entity1 less than two years ago , returned to his old stamping ground on thursday night to demonstrate that he has fought back to become one of @entity5 ’s most exciting young talents			1
a new era desperately needs new stars and @entity0 chose the perfect stage of @entity9 to show he is at the forefront of those who will be seeking to inspire @entity5 after the depths of their winter nightmare in @entity15			0
here @entity0 , who first came to @entity5 from his native @entity16 on a scholarship with @entity18 , thrived with both bat and ball to sentence @entity21 to only their second defeat in 21 completed games in all formats			0
star of the show : @entity0 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity29 having a blast : @entity31 man @entity0 had earlier smashed 38 runs from 13 balls the fact that both of those losses came against @entity5 will encourage @entity37 at the start of a pivotal summer when he has been backed to build a new side alongside the returning coach @entity40			1
for now @entity5 will be happy that they have got off to a winning start in this @entity43 series against a gifted one - day team who have contested five of the last seven finals in global limited - overs tournaments			1
it may be a new era but @entity5 are determined to stick to tried and tested methods in one - day cricket , backing their best batsmen to adapt rather than trying to inject dynamism in the form of @entity56 into the top order			1
their policy worked , with @entity59 looking much more suited to the longer limited - overs format than he did when making his @entity62 comeback here in the defeat by @entity21 on tuesday			0
firmly on the front foot : @entity66 hit five fours and a six during his swashbuckling 64 @entity59 looked in great nick as he reached 50 off 56 balls , with one glorious straight six , but he let himself down with a dopey dismissal with storm clouds gathering over @entity72 about to halt @entity5 ’s momentum			2
wickets can significantly effect targets under the @entity76 so @entity59 gave @entity21 quite a break when he steered @entity78 to @entity79 just before the heavens opened to register their disapproval at his folly			0
it could have proved a key moment in this first of five one - day internationals but , once the @entity9 had been mopped up , @entity5 rallied with highly promising contributions from the @entity88 pair of @entity66 and @entity89 and a quite brilliant late assault			1
@entity0 , now 25 and who rebuilt his career at @entity31 last year , has proved himself quite a hitter in his short @entity5 career , most notably when he hit four sixes in the final over of a @entity62 international in @entity98 and then when he struck the only ball he received over the boundary against @entity101			2
debut to remember : @entity102 took two wickets - including that of the great @entity105 now he showed the ability which will encourage @entity5 to believe they have unearthed a genuine all - rounder when he smashed 38 off just 13 balls , 93 runs coming off the last seven overs as @entity111 joined in with 26 off 20			1
together they lifted @entity5 to 247 for six off 39 overs with only the mystery spin of @entity114 , who took three wickets , causing them any distress			0
@entity79 has longed proved imperious at the end of an innings , but he had never suffered like this against @entity5 before , his eight wicketless overs costing more runs , 71 , than in 19 previous one - day internationals			1
@entity125 contribution : @entity89 chipped in with some vital runs in the middle order even though @entity21 should have had the edge batting second when their target was reduced to 226 off 32 overs they were never in the hunt , with @entity0 taking three wickets of his own as they fell 81 short of their adjusted aim			0
the icing on the @entity5 cake was a superb running catch from @entity37 , who hailed a ‘ really important win ’ afterwards , to dismiss @entity78 which was raucously received by an @entity9 crowd who backed up the captain ’s assertion that the public are still behind his side			0
they certainly will be if @entity5 keep on winning like this			0
man of the match : @entity0 looks to have cemented his place in @entity5 's odi side			2

@entity5 take 1 - 0 lead in five - match one - day international series
@entity0 named man of the match after taking three wickets and scoring 38 runs
@entity88 batsman @entity66 top - scores with 64 runs
