the majority of parents in a recent poll admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly , and 77 per cent blamed the web			1

on average , half of parents said they would also be comfortable with a child having a @entity3 account by the age of 12			2
tablets are now more important to children than their tvs , with more than one - third of young people aged five to 15 owning their own device			2
around 34 per cent of children in this category own their own tablet , which is up from 19 per cent last year , according to official @entity60 figures			2
and six in ten children use a tablet at home - a 50 per cent increase on 2013 - while the number of children with televisions in their rooms has fallen by a third in five years			2
@entity70 , @entity35 ’s chief executive said : ‘ children display different levels of maturity and as a rule you ca n’t always say every child is ready to do this or that by a certain age			0

the majority of parents who took part in the poll said their children owned a mobile phone , pierced their ears and had a tv in their bedroom at the age of 10			1
getting an @entity97 , choosing their own clothes and making their own breakfast were also luxuries listed that a typical 10 year old can enjoy			1

‘ most children will pester their parents and demand the latest gadgets , but it ’s important to also take into account whether or not they ’re ready for what they might encounter and if they do start using this sort of technology , to make sure they are safe online , ’ continued mr @entity70			0

@entity135 , ceo of @entity136 said : ‘ children of today are part of a digital generation , they just do not know any different than to use technology and the internet			0
‘ however , whilst it may be second nature , it ’s important that young people understand the risks and the boundaries they should observe			0
‘ part of this is about trust and education			0
like learning to ride a bike , or crossing the road , the most effective way to educate children is to start early and empower them to take responsibility for their own safety			0
‘ for many parents this means educating themselves too so they can feel confident talking to their children about online behaviour and safety .			0
