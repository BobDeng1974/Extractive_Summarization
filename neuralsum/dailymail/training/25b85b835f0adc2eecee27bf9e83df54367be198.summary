by @entity0 published : 15:19 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 11:06 est , 13 january 2013 a convicted murderer has protested his innocence in an unprecedented @entity4 video filmed behind bars			1
@entity6 , 24 , is serving a life sentence in a @entity9 prison for the brutal murder of his teenage girlfriend @entity6			1
but now , in a landmark move , prison authorities have given permission for footage shot in jail to be made public			0
the extraordinary move is believed to be the first time a convicted criminal has ever been seen taking - and passing - a polygraph test while in prison			1
@entity6 , who has consistently denied killing 14 - year - old @entity35 , hopes that releasing the clip onto the internet will persuade the public that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice			1
found guilty : @entity6 was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend @entity6 by a jury in 2005 at the end of last week , he told his mother : ' i want the world to see that i actually went through this process and it backed what i have always said - that i did n’t kill @entity35			1
' as revealed in the @entity54 , @entity6 passed a lie detector test carried out by an independent expert in a prison visiting room last april			1
as is normal practice , the test was filmed			0
campaigners backing @entity6 applied to the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) to use the footage to help clear his name			2
permission from the @entity62 was required because the clip was filmed within prison grounds			0
and last week the governor of @entity69 , the top - security jail where @entity6 is being held , gave the go - ahead			1
the footage shows @entity6 dressed in a standard prison - issue blue tee - shirt being asked a series of questions - including three key questions related directly to the murder			1
@entity6 , jailed for a minimum of 20 years in january 2005 , was shown to be telling the truth when he denied being involved			2
the convicted killer was interviewed by experienced polygraph examiner @entity82 , secretary of the @entity83 , who has carried out a string of lie tests in @entity87 prisons although the examination of @entity6 has been his only work in a jail north of the border			2
the release of the video is the first time footage of one of his prison tests has been shown publicly			2
@entity6 ’s mother @entity96 said her son was delighted that the public can now watch him passing the test			2
ongoing battle : @entity6 , pictured on @entity101 shortly after the discovery of @entity6 ' body , has always maintained his innocence and repeatedly asked for polygraph tests family support : @entity6 with his mother @entity96 , 53 , has always stood by her son murdered schoolgirl : @entity6 was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years for the murder of his 14 - year - old girlfriend @entity6 , pictured mrs @entity112 , 53 , who visited him on thursday , said : ' he says he has never had anything to hide so he did n’t hesitate when he had the chance to take it			1
in fact , he had asked for a polygraph since day one			0
' @entity6 told me he believes the test is a crucial indication of his innocence to go along with other issues , such as the lack of forensic evidence linking him to the crime			2
' mrs @entity112 has also passed a lie test , backing her claim that she was with the convicted killer at their home at the time of the murder			1
missing : @entity6 was found murdered in june 2003 near her home in @entity27 during his polygraph examination , the camera focuses on @entity6 , who tries to remain still throughout as any movement can affect the monitoring process			1
on the advice of the examiner , he keeps his eyes closed throughout			0
mr @entity82 is heard putting a series of questions to @entity6 three times , changing the order on each occasion			2
answering the three questions directly relating to the murder , @entity6 clearly says “ no ” when asked : “ were you present when @entity35 was stabbed ? ” in answer to the question : ' did you stab @entity35 on june 30 , 2003 ? ' , @entity6 responds : ' no ' in a strong voice			1
he speaks more quietly as he repeats : ' no ' when asked : ' did you know for certain where @entity35 ’s body would be found ? ' the question was asked in light of evidence in court that @entity6 led searchers to @entity35 ’s body because he knew where it was			1
he has always claimed his dog alerted him to the gruesome discovery			0
after the tests were carried out last year , mr @entity82 concluded that @entity6 had been telling the truth			0
he said : ‘ i ’m certain of the test result			0
i ca n’t believe @entity6 was convicted on the evidence that was available			0
’ he said @entity6 appeared confident but slightly nervous as he arrived to undertake the test process , which took nearly two - and - a - half hours			1
mr @entity82 explained : ‘ most people are nervous because of the unfamiliar technology rather than the fear of failing			0
@entity6 's mother @entity112 at @entity174 when he was found guilty of murder , left in 2005 , and after he was refused leave to appeal his conviction to @entity179 's highest court , pictured right in 2011 results : the test found that @entity6 was telling the truth when he said he had no involvement in the murder of @entity6 ' i spoke to him at length about what happened on the day of the murder , from before leaving school , and up to the next day			1
' he got very upset when he began recalling the moment when he found @entity35 ’s body			2
during the test i asked him to close his eyes so he could concentrate and not be distracted by the prison officers who were observing through the glass walls of the meeting room			0
' at the end i asked him how he thought he ’d got on			0
he confidently said : “ i ’ve passed ”			0
’ @entity198 : @entity6 was just 14 when his girlfriend was murdered near their homes in @entity28 @entity6 was just 14 when @entity35 was brutally murdered near their homes in @entity28 after she had gone out to meet him			1
he was 16 when he was found guilty after a marathon trial that culminated in 2005			1
@entity35 was found behind a wall beside a lonely path near her home in @entity207			1
she had suffered a slashed throat and post-mortem cuts to her eyelids , right cheek , left breast , abdomen and right forearm			0
there was also a penetrating wound to her mouth and her hands had been tied			0
@entity6 has always insisted he was n’t guilty of the horrific slaying but failed to have his conviction quashed on appeal			2
his case is currently being examined by the @entity223 , which investigates potential miscarriages of justice and can recommend a fresh appeal			0
polygraph tests are inadmissible in @entity9 courts but the report on @entity6 ’s test was included in his submission to the @entity223			2
criminologist dr @entity232 , who has spearheaded the campaign to free @entity6 along with his mother , said the lie test provided important evidence			1
' the polygraph result in @entity6 ’s case reinforces what the other evidence has been telling us all along – there is not a scrap of evidence that @entity6 murdered @entity6 , ' she insisted			0
she criticised @entity6 ’s prosecution , insisting : ' the case against him was " purely circumstantial " – bits and pieces cobbled together to try to make a justifiable case			0
' yet the real evidence shows the prosecution case to be untenable , ' she claimed			0
a @entity62 spokesman confirmed : ' the @entity62 had no objection to the release of the footage , with the consent of mr @entity6			0

@entity6 , 14 , was found dead in woods near her @entity28 home in 2003
@entity6 , also 14 when @entity35 died , was found guilty of her murder in 2005
@entity6 - who is serving life in prison - has always maintained he is innocent
