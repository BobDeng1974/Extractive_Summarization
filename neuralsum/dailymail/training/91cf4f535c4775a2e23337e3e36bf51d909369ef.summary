the consumer version of the much anticipated @entity3 virtual reality headset is just months away , the company has revealed			1

he admitted the latest prototype , codenamed @entity13 , is ' largely finalized for a consumer product			1
' we 're all hungry for it to happen , ' he told the audience			2
' we 're getting very close			2
it 's months , not years away , but many months			2
' he also revealed one area holding back the product was the lack of a controller			2
he said keyboards , mice and gamepads are n't up to the job and neither is gesture - control			2
' you want to feel it when you touch a button , ' he said			0
@entity37 acquired @entity38 , the designers of the xbox 360 controller in march			0
@entity4 also revealed that although the technology is currently similar to ski goggles , future versions will look like sunglasses			0
@entity4 also revealed the company has changed significantly since it was acquired by @entity46 in march			0
operating as an independent subsidiary , @entity37 has grown from 75 people to over 200 employees and now operates a separate r&d division			1
asked about the threat of rival @entity10 products , @entity4 said his main concern is shoddy implementation			0
in recent months dozens of firms have revealed low cost headsets using a movbile phone as the display			0
' we 're a little worried about bigger companies putting out products that are n't ready			0
' disorientation and motion sickness is the elephant in the room			0
' we 're encouraging big companies not to put out a product before it 's ready			0
' we want to get it right , we do n't want it to be four or five years			0
we 're eager for this to happen			0
' earlier this year the @entity46 - owned firm has unveiled its @entity13 model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor , and now features 360 - degree tracking			1
reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $ 200 ( £ 122 )			1
@entity4 says it is too early to say what the ' killer app ' is - but said it could even be face to face talking			0
' one that resonates with us internally is that this will have a big aspect of gaming , where you feel like you 're in the game or movie			0
' but when we can have face to face conversations , that 's a big @entity93 in the future you can throw in a pair on sunglasses and have the same conversation we are having , that 's really transformative			0
' the @entity13 virtual reality headset ( pictured ) was unveiled at the @entity101 conference in @entity102 at the weekend			1
it is lighter than its predecessor and features 360 - degree tracking , but @entity106 is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device @entity110 has been using the latest version of the headset , the $ 350 ( £ 215 ) @entity114 version aimed at developers wanting to write @entity10 apps			1
at first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky , although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps			1
however , once you are immersed in a virtual world , doubts were quickly forgotten			0
the technology , still just a developer 's version , is breathtakingly good			0
while the resolution still does n't give the feeling of quite being in the real world , it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world			0
the number of demos and games is already growing by the day , and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space , all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves			0
it 's not quite ready for primetime yet , but is almost there - and the @entity3 headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality			1
the 360 - degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer 's head movements , which in turn will make games more immersive and true - to - life			2
elsewhere , the headset has a higher resolution , per eye , than the current second - generation development kit – @entity114 - and these displays are powered by @entity161 devices			2
a teardown of the @entity114 revealed that the headset uses @entity165 displays , and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship @entity169			1
by comparison , the @entity114 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye , and the note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution			2
aside from these specifications , @entity106 is yet to release the rest of @entity13 's features			1
' there are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer @entity3 , but @entity13 is truly the best virtual reality headset we 've ever built , ' said mr @entity4			1
the price of the @entity3 consumer model , which does not have a release date yet , was revealed by @entity106 co-founder @entity190			1
speaking with @entity191 , mr @entity190 said the price could go up to $ 400 ( £ 240 ) , but that the price range was an estimate			1

previously , @entity106 said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $ 300 ( £ 185 )			1
