lying on the bed , i try to relax as my therapist massages tea tree cleanser into my skin , before wiping toner across my cheeks			2
while this might sound like a run of the mill beauty treatment , it 's not			1
i 'm face down on the couch , and it 's not my face that 's getting a pampering			1
it 's , um , my bottom			1
that 's right , i 'm having a ' bacial ' - a bottom facial - which , according to those in the know , is this season 's hottest beauty therapy			1
they 've spearheaded the trend for ' belfies ' - self - portraits of one 's posterior , posted on social media			1
as a result , bottoms are taking centre stage , with one @entity41 salon group reporting that , in the past few months , they have seen a 200 per cent rise in enquiries for the treatments			1
' many of those undergoing the bum facials said they were motivated by seeing celebrities ' perfect behinds on @entity50 or @entity51 , ' says @entity52 , ceo of @entity53			1
' one of the most common complaints is a spotty bottom			0
while a lot of people are affected by this problem , it 's terribly embarrassing for sufferers , especially now it 's swimsuit season			1
blemishes can be caused by anything from hormones to tight underwear causing friction and trapping sweat against the skin , but a bit of @entity70 can work wonders			0
' beauty expert : @entity73 helps @entity24 achieve the perfect derriere while i have no intention of posting a ' belfie ' any time soon , i am only too aware that my own middle - aged bottom is somewhat neglected - and with a beach holiday looming , a bacial seems prudent			1
the bacial at @entity53 is bespoke to each client - when it comes to bottoms , one size apparently does n't fit all			1
so my treatment begins with an assessment			0
i strip off my jeans and climb onto the massage table			0
unsure of the dress code , i opt for bikini bottoms			0
but before i have a chance to think about it further , my therapist , @entity73 , has pulled them aside to inspect the damage			0
( learn from my mistake - it 's easier for the therapist if you bite the bullet and go commando , or slip into one of the salon 's paper thongs			1
) having endured the embarrassment of my 55 - year - old buttocks being scrutinised under an unforgiving light , i perk up when @entity73 informs me that i am fortunate enough to be free of blemishes			1
but , she tells me gravely , years of neglect have left my bottom looking rather lacklustre			0
some maintenance , she tells me , is most definitely in order			0
fruity : @entity73 applies a blueberry smoothie - not a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells what were once dimples are now plain cellulite and things are n't as firm as they used to be			1
plus , as i have n't exfoliated in some time , things are more prickly pear than peach			0
@entity73 prescribes a ' blueberry smoothie ' which is n't a drink but a chemical peel aimed at removing dead skin cells			1
this is to be followed by @entity133 light therapy - a non-invasive treatment using a high - grade cold laser to heal problematic skin			1
but first , my buttocks are massaged with tea tree cleansing cream			0
while having a stranger pummel your bottom is peculiar , i nevertheless feel my gluteus maximus begin to relax			0
next is another cleanse , using a toner that aims to increase skin cell turnover , and then it 's time for the smoothie , a mask containing blueberry extracts , blue corn meal and lactic acids			1
ever since a @entity155 episode where @entity157 's face is left red raw after such a treatment , the term ' chemical peel ' has struck fear in my heart			1
now it is striking fear into my nether regions			0
but @entity73 reassures me that , although i might feel a light tingle or warmth on application , this is a very gentle peel that will restore a glow without visible irritation			1
she presses the mask on and leaves me to relax for 15 minutes while the mask weaves its magic			0
i ca n't help wondering what on @entity177 my husband would make of all this if he could see me , wearing nothing but a mask across my bottom			0
( i removed my bikini following the initial embarrassment )			0
women are keen to emulate the bottoms of stars like @entity29 , right , and @entity188 - @entity187 after a quarter of an hour has passed , warm , damp flannels are used to wipe off the mask , leaving my buttocks invigorated			1
then it 's time for the sciencey bit , with a little led light therapy - which uses a combination of coloured lights to promote healing , correct pigmentation , help with any scar tissue and encourage circulation			1
@entity73 wheels over an arch - shaped lighting panel , which she places about 18 inches above my bottom before switching it on			1
i do n’t feel anything , not even warmth , but my bottom is lit up like a rainbow			0
the blue light is an anti-bacterial spot blaster , which has the added benefit of preparing the skin for sun exposure by increasing its natural uv protection , making it a perfect pre-holiday treatment			1
the yellow light boosts the nervous , lymphatic and circulatory systems and helps detoxify skin tissue			2
in combination with the red light , it stimulates collagen production , which results in firmer skin			2
@entity73 says three to five treatments are recommended to obtain the best results			2
while the led panel does its work , i dream of my new and improved bottom jauntily making its way along a @entity232 beach			0
after 15 minutes , the led is wheeled away and @entity73 massages a divine - smelling shea butter moisturiser into the whole area , gently putting one hand on top of the other and tapping to create a vibrating sensation , which apparently aids lymphatic drainage			1
the process ends with a warning to keep my buttocks hydrated for the next four or five days - not a sentence you hear very often - using a rich body lotion			2
finally , i sit up and , even without looking , i feel optimistic about the state of my derriere			2
just knowing it ’s had such state - of - the - art treatment makes me feel more confident			2
and frankly , so it should , because if there ’s one thing that might give me pause for thought , it ’s the price			0
at £ 180 for the @entity255 plus a further £ 150 for the @entity256 , i 'm quite literally sitting on a fortune			0
but it 's worth it			2
after just one session , i 'm delighted , as is my husband , who comments on how smooth it feels			0
my bum feels firmer , the skin looks plump , its tone better , and my formerly dehydrated cheeks feel ... dare i say it , soft as a baby 's bottom			2
if you ca n't quite stretch to a £ 300 - plus bacial , try @entity272			2
anything you 'd use on your face can also be used on your bum			0
start with a cleanser - @entity277 ( £ 3.49 , superdrug.com ) contains spotbusting salicyclic acid , as well as blueberry to reduce the appearance of marks			2
if you want to use a toner , @entity284 ' @entity283 ( £ 25 , clarins.co.uk ) encourages cell renewal and prevents the build - up of dead skin cells			2
as for exfoliating , a body brush can scratch , so try a gentle fruit acid mask such as @entity291 ( £ 30 , renskincare.com )			0
leave for ten minutes and then remove with a warm , wet flannel			0
moisturise with @entity293 ( £ 19.99 , boots.com ) , which will also boost cell turnover .			0

@entity297 and @entity29 started trend for ' belfies '
