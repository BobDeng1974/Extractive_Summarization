indigenous @entity1 models have yet to make a significant impact on the runway but an exclusively @entity5 modelling agency is in the swing of changing that cultural fashion landscape			1
the first name that comes to mind when thinking of @entity5 models for even the most die - hard of fashionistas is @entity12 who was one of the most prominent faces during @entity14 in @entity15 this week			1
the only other indigenous face to join the 24 - year - old stunner at the biggest week on the country 's fashion calendar over the past two years is @entity20			2
on the rise : @entity22 is one of the many emerging models signed with @entity24 gaining ground : the agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including @entity28 ( pictured ) however , next year 's annual global event will mark a significant shift if @entity24 founder @entity31 gets her way			1
' i expect at least five or 10 to be appearing in next year 's fashion week , ' she said			0
' realistically i would like to see up to 10 of our girls go through to next year 's fashion week - we do have quite a few of them that have the potential , ' she said			0
what started out as helping out a few modelling mates break into the industry two and half years ago quickly turned into a niche market that @entity5 models have long been crying out for by the start of last year for the @entity48 - @entity5			1
hot right now : agency founder @entity31 hopes 10 of her girls will join @entity12 at next year 's fashion week in demand : @entity51 walked in a number of major shows at @entity14 @entity31 began representing females who had the runway standards in terms of height and size			1
' we focused on high fashion calibre models , ' she said			2
' we started out with five then it became 25 and now we have 40 models			0
' now the agency is about to take on a whole new approach when casting begin for both female and male models aged anywhere up to 60 years old across five capital cities			2
the @entity68 post for the casting call in @entity70 tomorrow has already attracted more than 350 shares and @entity31 has received at least 400 emails with expressions of interest			1
' i 'm expecting the numbers to go ridiculous especially when we go onto @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , ' she said			0
@entity31 says the high fashion market is slowly changing its perspective when it comes to indigenous models but she hoped it would move along more quickly ( @entity85 pictured ) the 26 - year - old is finding the mid-market range of big family chain stores such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 are particularly interested in hiring @entity5 models for their catalogue campaigns			1
' they are a lot more receptive opposed to the high fashion market because it has had a particular look for quite some time , ' she said			1
' it 's a slow process but the perspective is changing - a lot of opportunities are opening but i personally would like to see it happen quicker but there is a lot of caution and a lot of stereotypes linked so you have to face that			0
' @entity31 , whose father is @entity5 and mother is @entity48 , faced discrimination when she started modelling in her teens			2
big family chain stores such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 are particularly interested in hiring @entity5 models for their catalogue campaigns ( pictured @entity113 ) ' it was difficult to overcome both personally and professionally , ' she said			1
' i thought " that 's who i am - what 's the problem with it ? "			0
' she believes that the reason for casting agents hesitance to hire @entity5 models was because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes			1
' i think anytime you get involved with anything indigenous there is always that political aspect of what 's happening in the community and what 's happening across the nation and people assume that will come with it , ' she said			0
' but it 's really important to separate individual events and be able to take it professionally and realise that not everyone slots into specific categories			0
' @entity31 believes that high - end brands are hesitant to sign @entity5 models because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes ( pictured @entity147 ) @entity31 says with @entity51 being the most famous @entity5 face on the catwalk - she would like to see her act as a voice for young aspiring indigenous models			1
' she 's a very shy girl but i just think that she could come out of her shell a little bit more and be a spokesperson and promote @entity157 for models in particular and just build a little bit more brand awareness , ' she said			0
' i think if she spoke up a bit more being in the position that she 's in that it would help the next crop of young girls coming through			0
' @entity31 encourages the models that she represents to embrace who their origins			2
' i encourage our girls to be proud of who they are as a person and be proud of who they are in their cultural aspect but not to allow anybody else to target you based on other people 's actions			0
' @entity31 hopes to have as many as 10 of her girls in next year 's @entity182			0

@entity24 has 40 female *clients* so far
new national casting call is now looking for both sexes aged up to 60
founder is expecting the numbers to take off as interest rapidly grows
@entity90 , @entity89 and @entity91 are very interested in hiring @entity5 models
@entity31 says demand for indigenous models is slowly changing in the high fashion market but should be moving faster
