@entity0 has pledged to find a fix for @entity3 ’s confidence crisis after the @entity4 was the chief striking sinner in a shock @entity7 stalemate with @entity9			1
the on - loan @entity12 man ’s grim form in front of goal continued with another blank and a bad second - half miss in 0 - 0 draw			1
that ’s five games without netting for the erstwhile self - assured forward who burst on to the @entity22 scene with 11 goals in 10 appearances			1
‘ he is struggling at the moment , you can see that , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ his ambitions are very high and he is even more disappointed than everyone else			0
‘ the only people who can do something about that is us			0
so we have to work hard in training every day and see what we can do to get it going			2
‘ we know that he can score goals , he has done it before			0
he has n’t become a much worse player in a month , it is just small details that we are going to have to turn around			0
the on loan @entity12 striker puts his hands to head after missing a gilt - edged chance ‘ he will come back			1
my challenge — and his as well — would be get that back as quickly as possible			0
’ despite the first scoreless league draw in over three years at @entity62 , @entity7 extended their title lead to five points over @entity65			1
however , @entity0 ’s bid to build on that advantage for the remainder of the festive period could be undermined by an injury to @entity71			2
the @entity72 suffered a calf strain nine minutes into yesterday ’s game and @entity0 was unsure of the striker ’s prospects of facing @entity35 or @entity77 next monday night			1
@entity7 manager @entity0 watches on as his side fail to beat @entity9 at @entity62 on saturday @entity0 will be hoping the surfaces on their travels , including the artificial one at @entity81 , is better than the one at @entity62 that he feels is not currently conducive to his preferred style of play			1
‘ the pitch is not 100 per cent right now so we have to use one extra touch and the attacks get slower , ’ he complained			2
‘ it ’s a bit bumpy but that is not an excuse , we should have created a lot more			0
‘ if you can get an early goal it is important as well , they have to attack and try to lose something and there is a bit more space			0
‘ in the end it was a lack of creativity and tempo			0

@entity7 endured a *frustrating* goalless draw with @entity9 on saturday
@entity3 has failed to *register* in his last five games for @entity7
the on loan @entity12 striker scored 10 in 11 games earlier in the *season*
manager @entity0 will work with @entity3 to *re-find* scoring touch
