' @entity0 ' : sen. @entity2 's reference was to heavyweight boxer @entity4 's successful 1974 strategy of stretching out his fight against @entity6 , by feigning weakness in order to exhaust the older fighter over the long - term senator @entity2 today said he fears that president @entity10 is a victim of a ' game of rope - a - dope ' being played by @entity14 's @entity13 ' as the slaughter goes on '			1
@entity2 , who has alternated between supporting @entity10 's course and publicly lamenting its weakness , spoke out after the president 's landmark national address last night in which he agreed to bow to @entity14 plans to broker a handover of @entity23 's chemical weapons			1
' i 'm worried that we have a game of rope - a - dope for a while , and the slaughter goes on , ' @entity2 said wednesday morning at a @entity31 breakfast in @entity32			0
' i think if you were sitting in @entity13 's seat , you would feel pretty good today , ' @entity2 added later			1
@entity36 @entity35 has expressed puzzlement at why the president has n't insisted that any diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis end with @entity42 's removal from power			2
meanwhile , aides to members of @entity46 told @entity47 today that the chief fear swirling around @entity49 is that in the hands of @entity13 , an apparent deal to separate @entity23 dictator @entity42 from his chemical weapons could be a giant stalling tactic			1
a staffer to a senior member of that committee said wednesday afternoon that by relegating @entity59 military muscle to backup - plan status , the president ' all but guaranteed that @entity13 will think he has a really long leash			1
' ' not that we 'll be in a position to pull it anyway , ' the aide added			0
who 's the boss ? @entity13 now appears in charge , while @entity10 's embrace of a diplomatic path in @entity23 has limited @entity59 's options the a-team : @entity14 foreign minister @entity72 ( r ) and his @entity23 counterpart @entity73 ( @entity74 ) turned @entity76 's gaffe into a diplomatic triumph that leaves @entity10 on the outside looking in @entity10 said tuesday that ' it ’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the @entity42 regime keeps its commitments			1
' ' but this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force , ' he added , ' particularly because @entity14 is one of @entity42 ’s strongest allies			0
' ' i have , therefore , asked the leaders of @entity46 to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path			0
' ' i devoutly wished last night that the president had said what he told [ sen. ] @entity100 and me in the @entity101 , ' @entity2 said wednesday morning			2
' and that was that he supported efforts ... to bring about negotiations which would lead to the departure of @entity42			0
' speaking during his daily press briefing , @entity109 press secretary @entity108 said wednesday that @entity10 's initial threat of military force in @entity23 ' was not designed to precipitate regime change			1
' ' i expect that this will take some time , ' @entity108 acknowledged			0
' but we also are not interested in delaying tactics			2
' only hours before @entity10 's speech , in a hearing of the @entity119 , secretary of state @entity76 insisted tuesday that any proposal for a @entity14 - brokered deal with @entity42 ' has to be swift , it has to be real , it has to be verifiable			1
it can not be a delaying tactic			0
' but another congressional aide who works for a @entity35 on the @entity126 said one reason why the @entity109 has recently backed off from its earlier calls for regime change is that ' @entity10 knows this thing will take years , not weeks , to play out			1
' ' the @entity59 will see its own regime change in 2017 , and odds are @entity42 will still be in power then , ' the aide predicted			1
out of breath : @entity76 was in @entity136 on monday and testified in @entity32 on tuesday			0
on wednesday he took counsel from former @entity139 @entity138 before boarding a plane for @entity141 , @entity142 to meet with @entity14 's foreign minister back to work : hours after concluding his 15 - minute speech on @entity23 , @entity10 was volunteering to pack food donations on the 9/11 anniversary near the nation 's capital winner : @entity23 president @entity42 stands to lose much of his chemical weapons stockpiles but will likely remain in power , fighting his civil war with conventional weapons sent from @entity14 by the boatload @entity23 's tentative agreement to allow @entity14 and international officials to locate and remove its chemical weapons caches had its genesis in what sen. @entity2 called a ' queasy ' moment of last - minute , accidental diplomacy			1
@entity76 answered a reporter 's question during a @entity136 press conference on monday , quipping that if @entity42 were to ' turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week , ' he could avoid @entity59 military strikes			2
' he is n't about to do it , ' @entity76 quickly added , ' and it ca n't be done , obviously			0
' but the @entity14 and @entity23 foreign ministers saw an opening and played it to the hilt , emerging with an agreement that cut @entity10 out of the loop – and started a ball rolling that will likely take a long time to find its resting place			1
' we 'll never see this @entity14 plan put into action as it 's the sort of thing that takes years to negotiate , ' @entity181 diplomacy expert @entity180 - @entity179 told @entity186			0
@entity187 , a researcher at the @entity188 in @entity189 , said @entity13 's true goal ' is to play for time , to push off the talk of strikes as long as possible			2
' ' the longer he pushes them off , the less likely they are			0
i 'd say the chances now of strikes are about 5 percent			0
' @entity42 has continued to demonstrate that even without chemical weapons , his conventional arms can wreak havoc on rebel - controlled regions of @entity23			2
heavy artillery shelling caused this destruction in @entity206 , a district of @entity207 , on tuesday @entity208 , the @entity209 prime minister , has also observed in @entity210 that any @entity212 deal would need to include safeguards ' to make sure that this is n’t some delaying tactic , that this is n’t some ruse			0
' some in @entity46 are naturally suspicious of @entity13 , compounding their existing qualms about @entity59 foreign policy in the hands of @entity10 and @entity76			1
@entity222 @entity221 rep. @entity221 , a one - time @entity223 valedictorian who sits on the @entity224 , observed after @entity10 's tuesday evening address that ' i hope this works			2
' ' [ @entity228 ] ut i am always skeptical , ' he added , ' when @entity13 is making an offer to help			0

fears of delay tactics sweep @entity49 as @entity46 learns how long a @entity14 - brokered deal with @entity23 will take to unfold
' i think if you were sitting in @entity13 's seat , you would feel pretty good today , ' sen. @entity2 said wednesday
president @entity10 ' all but guaranteed ' with his tuesday night speech , said one @entity242 aide , ' that @entity13 will think he has a really long leash '
' the @entity59 will see its own regime change in 2017 , ' said another congressional staffer , ' and odds are @entity42 will still be in power then '
' this will take some time , ' admitted @entity10 's *spokesman* , ' but we also are not interested in delaying tactics '
