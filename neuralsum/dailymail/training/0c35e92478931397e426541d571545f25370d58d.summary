it appears @entity1 is hot on the heels of rival @entity3 and is gearing up to launch its own curved smartphone , according to leaked photographs			1
technology site @entity6 claims to have obtained three rendered images of what is believed to be @entity1 's rumoured @entity10 phone set to launch as early as next month			1
the overall design of the phone is shown , cast in shadows , and the handset curves from top to bottom - unlike @entity3 's @entity16 that curves from left to right			1
technology site @entity6 discovered the images , pictured , which appear to show @entity1 's @entity10 device with a 6 - inch screen			1
it curves from top to bottom - unlike @entity3 's @entity16 that curves from left to right there 's been a bit of a @entity24 between the two @entity26 phone makers in recent months ; as soon as one announces an advancement in flexible technology , the other follows suit shortly after			1
the two firms were the first in the world to sell curved oled tv screens , for example			0
@entity3 announced earlier this year it was working on flexible smartphone technology before @entity1 claimed it had completed work on its own flexible 6 - inch plastic screen at the start of last week			1
just a day later , @entity3 unveiled its @entity16 handset in @entity26			1
@entity3 claimed its @entity16 handset was curved on the horizontal because this makes it easier to hold in the palm of a hand			0
however , @entity1 's @entity10 appears to curve on the vertical which goes against @entity3 's claims - so what is the point of the technology ? following the @entity16 announcement last week , @entity51 expert @entity50 from @entity52 said : ' this is a @entity55 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky features			1
we still are n’t seeing a point			0
' @entity61 , chief technology officer at @entity62 said : ' some might be calling this a gimmick , but we think this is an interim step toward ‘ truly ’ flexible screens that would revolutionise the current form factors of mobile			2
' some people thought touchscreen phones were a gimmick and would never catch on			0
seven years later i think it ’s fair to say those people have been proved wrong			0
' @entity75 , global director of gadget insurer @entity76 , similarly disagrees and told @entity77 : ' while flexible screens have n't been lauded as an aesthetic marvel , they 're no design gimmick			0
' almost a third of mobile claims we process are for accidental damage - mainly cracked screens from people dropping or sitting on them			0
if unbreakable , bendable screens gain popularity , it would solve that problem overnight			0
' @entity91 , @entity92 online editor for @entity93 added : ' looking further on , the roll - up tablet would have obvious benefits for portability - it could be like carrying a real newspaper instead of a solid rectangle all over again - and there could be new , intuitive user interfaces introduced , as we 've already seen with @entity102 's @entity101 and its ability to swap between pages when its corners are bent slightly upwards			2
' there 's even talk of gadgets that can adapt their physical dimensions based on what you 're using them for			0
' @entity115 , @entity116 at @entity117 told @entity77 : ' there ’s hint of ‘ we ’ve launched it because we can ’ about some of the new curved smartphones announced recently , however it ’s really just the beginning			0
in the near future screens will become thinner and wo n’t need to be flat like they are today , making them better suited for certain tasks			0
a curved screen could help reduce glare in direct sunlight for example			0
' designers will be able to embed technology in a more subtle , natural way : both more attractive and comfortable to use - think of a curved sat nav display embedded seamlessly within the sweep of your car ’s dashboard or a status display on fridge fascia			1
' there ’s great possibilities for wearable technology too of course , for example curved smart watches or a tablet computer that can roll - up and even fold into your pocket			2
' the challenge will be to introduce flexible technology in way that ’s actually useful to people , not simply as a marketing gimmick			2
' @entity158 at e2save continued : ' provided the @entity16 proves to be robust in @entity26 , we could see round displays roll out on more smartphones and wearable tech over the next 2 - 3 years			1
' @entity163 , reviews editor from @entity164 told @entity77 : ' phones with curved glass displays have been released before			0
that particular model sold well , but it was n’t because it had a curved display it was because it was an all - round good phone with @entity172 ’s official stamp on it and one of the few at the time running stock @entity51			1
' the difference this time is this new technology , the flexible oled component , which is specifically the substrate underneath the glass and which actually produces the picture you see			2
' the technology is significant because it is unbreakable , unlike the older glass substrate , and in the future the flexible nature potentially allows for more inventive phone designs with things like wrap - around displays			1
' it ’s worth pointing out though that there ’s still a layer of glass on top , which is still breakable , so for users worried about cracking their screen the change is n’t quite as significant just yet , though this is likely to change in the future			0
' the @entity16 curves from left to right and is only currently available in the company 's home region			0
@entity1 is set to launch its own curved phone next month - although some experts claim it wo n't be ready until the start of next year			1
@entity1 's 6 - inch display is made of bendy plastic substrates , rather than glass , and the panel can be attached to any curved device			1
@entity3 's @entity16 handset , pictured , curves from left to right			2
the company claims this makes it more comfortable to hold than other phones this image shows the alleged @entity219 phone from a side angle			0
it appears to curve from top to bottom , unlike @entity3 's @entity16 , but it is thinner than its rival 's device the design is 0.44mm thick and has a protective film attached to the back , making it ' bendable and unbreakable			1
' it is vertically concave from top to bottom , has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g			2
@entity237 , the @entity239 firm 's research arm , additionally said it was ready to unveil a curved battery prototype ahead of any new handset launch			1
@entity244 's technology could also be fitted to smart watches , and other devices , that can be wrapped around items , pictured although the handset is n't expected to be bendy , the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more curved display than current phones			1
@entity3 's @entity254 and @entity255 phones have slightly curved , oled screens , but they both use curved glass , not flexible plastic			2
@entity244 claims the flexible oled panel is the ' world 's slimmest among existing mobile device panels			1
' the company 's new battery technology could also revolutionise smartphones because it is so bendy it can be tied in knots			2
it could even improve the battery life of phones because manufacturers could add more power into the batteries , if they 're not restricted by size or shape			0
@entity237 's cable - type lithium - ion battery can even woven into textiles			0
this means the technology could also be fitted to clothes , and users could end up ' wearing ' phone chargers .			0

@entity26 firm @entity244 unveiled its 6 - inch flexible display last week
the three rendered images were found by technology site @entity6
rumoured to be the @entity10 handset , it is shown curving from top to bottom
@entity1 's phone could launch as early as next month or by the start of next year
