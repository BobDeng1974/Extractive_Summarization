the devil is in the detail – literally hidden			2
when a @entity4 couple discovered a concealed , almost lifesize mural of @entity6 while redecorating their 16th - century @entity8 home a couple of years ago , they could not have been more excited , particularly when an expert spoke of its national importance			1
but husband - and - wife @entity13 and @entity15 were unnerved by a further chance discovery			1
@entity17 : when the portrait of @entity6 ( left ) , found by @entity13 and @entity15 , is turned upside - down , it is transformed into the head of the devil when the portrait of @entity6 on his throne is viewed upside - down his features transform into the devil , with horns and goats ’ eyes			1
the devil appears too when the mural is viewed through a glass			2
the mural is in the couple 's drawing - room in the village of @entity36 , the former @entity37 of the summer residence of 16th - century archdeacons of @entity40 including @entity41			1
while @entity6 ’s portrait would have been an expression of loyalty , the hidden message suggests it was commissioned by someone with quite another view of a monarch who established himself as head of the @entity50 in place of the @entity52			1
mrs @entity53 , a bestselling children ’s author who writes under the name @entity57 , and mr @entity15 , a former publisher , came across the devil by accident			1
the painting of @entity6 was discovered when some plaster was removed from a wall in house in @entity36 , @entity8 the house was once the summer residence of the @entity66 of @entity40 a portrait of @entity6 ( 1491 - 1547 ) aged 49 in 1540 , oil on panel by @entity70 they were relaxing upstairs by an open fire one evening when they noticed that a postcard of the mural which they had printed had fallen on the floor upside - down – revealing the portrait ’s sinister side			1
mrs @entity53 recalled : ' it was fairly low light			0
my husband noticed the face … we were both very spooked			0
it ’s quite an unpleasant image			2
i was bit horrified … i realised it was the devil			0
' @entity41 was one of the most influential religious leaders during the @entity88 and his influence spanned the reigns of three monarchs – @entity6 , @entity92 and @entity93 it was during the reign of @entity93 , a staunch @entity96 , that @entity41 was put to death			1
historians believe it was @entity41 who suggested to @entity6 that he should get the theological support of the @entity103 universities of @entity104 in his quest for a divorce from @entity107			1
in 1533 , the academic was offered the position of archbishop of canterbury			0
in an era when few dared to oppose a decision of the king , @entity41 accepted and was propelled into high politics			1
now one of the leading religious figure in the land , @entity41 started to develop his religious views			1
he wanted to see @entity103 embedded in @entity120 – a view more extreme that @entity6 in 1533			1
however , @entity41 kept on the right side of @entity6 by preaching his unswerving support for monarchical absolutism , which he justified by his support for the doctrine of divine right of kings			1
along with @entity129 , @entity41 worked out marriage proposals and divorces when required by @entity6			1
over the next years of @entity6 's reign , @entity41 and the king developed a very close relationship			1
during @entity93 's reign , @entity41 was charged with treason and imprisoned in the @entity137 in november 1553			2
in march 1554 , his religious views were declared heretical			0
on march 21 , 1556 , he was burned at the stake			0
they were so unnerved that they did not venture downstairs that evening			0
the next morning , they ' very gingerly opened the door ' , and were reassured to find @entity6 with the ' same old benign expression ' , mrs @entity53 said			2
as they peered more closely , they realised how skilfully the dangerous image had been concealed			2
the king ’s narrow shoulders become the devil ’s pointed chin and oddly - shaped sleeve - cuffs were satanic eye - sockets			0
the mural , which is thought to date from around the 1530s or 1540s , is almost six foot high and 20 foot wide			0
dr @entity156 , a wall paintings specialist with @entity158 who is researching the mural , said : ' it does look quite evil … hold a glass up to it , it 's bizarre			0
you get quite an eerie picture			0
' professor @entity165 , a specialist in the history of the church at @entity168 and @entity41 biographer , said that there was tremendous interest in optical illusion at the time , as shown by the distorted perspectives in @entity70 's famous painting of the ambassadors and @entity177 's portrait of @entity92			2
' so there ’s no reason why it should n’t be true , ' he said			0
he noted that one of the then archdeacons felt ' very equivocally ' about @entity6 ’s reformation : ' it 's just possible that , for a private joke , he put it in because you could only see it through an optic			1
i imagine that , in the privacy of his own dining - room … it could be enjoyable			0
' for obvious reasons , the painting is unsigned			0
conservator @entity196 , who is working on the mural , noted that it was painted at a time when the king was behaving ' excruciatingly badly '			0
the @entity201 are no longer frightened			0
mr @entity15 said : ' this was really … a delightful piece of satire			2
' as the old proverb goes : ' the devil is not so black as he is painted			0

@entity13 and @entity15 found mural in their 16th - century @entity8 home
but when they turned it upside down they saw the image of the beast

hidden message suggests it was commissioned by *opponent* of @entity6
