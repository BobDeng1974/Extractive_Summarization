most people give up chocolate for @entity2 but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own			1
@entity6 , 26 , from @entity7 , who nearly died in a horror crash , gave up ordinary clothes for @entity2 to raise money for the charity that saved her life			1
along with her business partner @entity14 , 28 , the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for @entity7 's @entity16			1
@entity6 and her business partner @entity14 dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the @entity20 which saved @entity21 after she was involved in car accident in 2010 the two women rated buskers in @entity7 's @entity26 while dressed as @entity27 , rode the tube as @entity30 lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas			1
@entity21 , co-founder of fitness company @entity34 , owes the charity her life after a crash in november 2010 left her with punctured lungs , 12 fractured vertebrae , broken ribs and a broken collarbone			1
the fitness fanatic had been out cycling near @entity44 in @entity45 in a bid to make the 2012 @entity48 triathlete team when her bike collided with a @entity51			2
she said : ' when i went down , nobody on my team saw it , so they just assumed i 'd taken a tumble and i 'd be fine in a minute or two			2
' luckily , the car behind us was driven by a physio for @entity63 ' rugby team and she took a look at me			1
@entity21 continued : ' she could hear a gurgling sound when i spoke , which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs			1
@entity21 and @entity14 dressed up as @entity27 one day and rated performers in @entity69 the two women larked about dressed as @entity70 in some shrubbery ' effectively , i was drowning and i was running out of time to live			1
her quick thinking probably saved my life			2
' @entity21 was airlifted to @entity75 , where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death			1
she underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work			2
doctors warned she may never walk again , but determined @entity21 worked hard at her rehabilitation			1
she said : ' in my head i thought as soon as i got home , it would all be okay , but when i got home i could n't really move			2
' i still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) wore a series of different costumes , here @entity14 is dressed as @entity94 @entity21 said that the pair had a lot of different reactions , from laughter to confusion the former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not ' one day , despite my mum 's protests , i decided to walk to the doctors			1
my neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as i could n't bend down			0
' i started walking but had to stop after around 400m			0
that 's when it hit home how little i could do			2
' following the accident , @entity21 , who had left university to train as a triathlete full time , was dropped by her former sponsors			1
' i wanted to prove i could get back to where i used to be , fitness wise , ' she said			2
' the less people believed in me , the more determined i became			0
' i later found out that , after the accident , doctors called my parents to say i may not survive			2
i think i was the only person who did n't think i was going to die			0
' larking about on a @entity125 bike @entity21 dressed up as a clown following her accident @entity21 was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine slowly , @entity21 began to repair herself			1
while easing herself back into exercise , she stumbled upon the idea for @entity34 , a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball			0
' while i was recovering from my injuries i thought to myself : " exercise as an adult really sucks			0
" it can be repetitive , isolating and boring			0
' i wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid			2
' it was the @entity34 members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge			1
' we were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a @entity2			0
a few were chucked around but none really stuck , ' said @entity21			1
for this costume @entity21 joked about as she was dressed up as a robber the girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes , including going to work and going to meetings ' somebody suggested [ giving up ] clothes as a joke and at first i thought : ' that 's the kind of thing that gets people arrested , ' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead			1
' we forget we 're wearing costumes until we get weird looks			0
people do react quite differently			0
some laugh , and some almost look disgusted			0
it depends on the outfit as some are n't obviously fancy dress			1
' our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big , corporate bank in our pyjamas			0
at first , they would n't even let us in the building			0
' in august 2012 , @entity21 cycled 16,000 miles from @entity187 to @entity7 , raising Â£ 10,000 for @entity7 's @entity16			1
now , she is keen to keep donating			0
' i owe the @entity16 my life			0
i would n't have survived without them , ' she said			0
