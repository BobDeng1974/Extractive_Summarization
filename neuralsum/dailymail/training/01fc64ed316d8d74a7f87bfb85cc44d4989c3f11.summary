president @entity0 knew he 'd be upsetting republicans in @entity2 when he announced on tuesday his intentions to press ahead with unilateral action on immigration			1
@entity7 leaders had been telling him for months that any attempt to circumvent the legislative process would be met with fierce opposition			0
but a handful of @entity12 came out against executive action , as well , this week , saying they 'd rather @entity2 make fixes to the immigration system than the president			1
' i 'm disappointed the president decided to use executive action at this time on this issue , as it could poison any hope of compromise or bipartisanship in the new @entity12 before it has even started , ' @entity18 sen. @entity17 told @entity26 on thursday			1
' @entity39 sen. @entity38 was also hesitant to fully get behind the president			1
' i have to be honest , how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable , i think it probably makes most @entity43 uncomfortable , ' she told @entity37			2
several of the @entity45 lawmakers acknowledged that like @entity0 , their first preference would have been for @entity2 to pass comprehensive immigration reform			2
their failure to do so does n't give him license to issue his own rules , though , they said			0
' i am as frustrated as anyone that @entity2 is not doing its job , but the president should n't make such significant policy changes on his own , ' @entity53 sen. @entity52 said in a press release on thursday			1
likewise , @entity61 sen. @entity60 said this week that he thought @entity0 should have waited until after newly elected members had the chance to weigh in on the issue before taking matters into his own hands			1
' if i were the president , what i 'd say to the @entity2 — @entity69 , @entity12 , @entity70 or @entity7 — i 'm going to give you a little bit of time and in the new @entity2 expect you to do something , ' @entity60 told reporters			1
as a result of midterm election victories , @entity7 will hold at least eight additional seats in the @entity12 , if not nine , depending on the outcome of a dec. 6 runoff in @entity81			2
republicans also picked up at least a dozen seats in the @entity69 , and potentially several more that have yet to be decided			0
president @entity0 blew off this week suggestions from both @entity7 and his fellow @entity12 that he give the @entity7 one more shot to make changes to the immigration system before going it alone , however , arguing at a press conference last sunday that he 'd been given the opposition party plenty of opportunities to act and he was done waiting			1
across the street from the @entity99 , leaders of @entity96 and @entity97 led the celebration today of president @entity0 's temporary measures to delay the deportation of nearly five million immigrants			2
supporters of immigration reform pose for a photo while holding a banner thanking @entity0 for his speech last night ' on immigration reform it continues to be my great preference to see @entity2 pass comprehensive legislation , because that is not reversed by a future president , it would have to be reversed by a future @entity2 , ' @entity0 said in response to a reporter 's question about the possibility of a future president rescinding his executive order			1
' that ’s part of the reason why i ’ve argued consistently that we ’re better off if we can get a comprehensive deal through @entity126 ’s why i showed extraordinary patience with @entity2 in trying to work a bipartisan deal , ' @entity0 stated			2
' that ’s why i was so encouraged when the @entity12 produced a bipartisan immigration deal and why i waited for over a year for @entity131 to call that bipartisan bill in the @entity69			0
' but , the president said , ' i ca n’t wait in perpetuity when i have authorities that , at least for the next two years , can improve the system , can allow us to shift more resources to the border rather than separating families ' and ' improve the legal immigration system			0
' i would be derelict in my duties if i did not try to improve the system that everybody acknowledges is broken , ' he argued			0
in an address to the nation on thursday night officially announcing the contents of his forthcoming executive order , @entity0 again proclaimed that he 'd been backed into a corner by @entity2 and was taking the lead on the issue only because lawmakers on @entity154 refused to bring his preferred reforms up for debate			1
' had the @entity69 allowed that kind of bill a simple yes - or - no vote , it would have passed with support from both parties , and today it would be the law			0
but for a year and a half now , @entity7 leaders in the @entity69 have refused to allow that simple vote , ' he said			0
' now , i continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law			0
but until that happens , there are actions i have the legal authority to take as president – the same kinds of actions taken by @entity45 and @entity7 presidents before me – that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just			0

at least five senators from the president 's own party said they wished he would n't take unilateral action
' i have to be honest , how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable , ' @entity39 sen. @entity38 said
@entity61 sen. @entity60 encouraged @entity0 to hold off until newly elected @entity7 senators were seated in @entity2
the president said on thursday that @entity7 currently in @entity2 have had plenty of time to enact reforms and now it up to him
