@entity0 are set to meet @entity1 in their @entity3 qualifier at @entity4 on thursday night with an estimated 40,000 less supporters than when the two sides last met in @entity7 two years ago			1
the @entity8 expects an attendance around 50,000 for the match against @entity12 ’s equal lowest - ranked team , making it likely to become the least attended competitive international football fixture at the stadium since the new @entity4 opened in 2007			2
the crowd will be even lower than when @entity0 faced @entity17 in a june 2009 @entity18 before 57,897 people on a night coinciding with a @entity21 strike			0
@entity22 prepares for @entity0 's @entity3 qualifier against @entity1 at @entity4 - about 50,000 fans are expected which would make the match the least attended competitive international at the stadium @entity28 limbers up at @entity29 as @entity0 ready for their @entity3 qualifier on thursday night @entity1 train at @entity4 on wednesday ahead of thursday night 's 7.45pm kick - off against @entity0 the last meeting with @entity1 , a @entity18 qualifier on october 12 , 2012 , was attended by 86,654 fans who witnessed a 5 - 0 win for the hosts with doubles from @entity22 and @entity28 , and one from @entity40			1
apathy in the wake of @entity0 ’s @entity18 failure , in which @entity45 ’s side failed to make it out of the group stage , has been largely blamed for diminished interest in the national team			0
a paltry 40,181 turned out for the 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity51 last month at @entity4 , the lowest attendance for any senior international			0
an improved performance in their @entity3 qualifying opener against @entity57 in @entity58 , won 2 - 0 by @entity45 's men , was an encouraging sign for fans but has n't translated into ticket sales			0
@entity22 scored the opener from the spot in the 2012 @entity18 qualifier at @entity4 against the same team that match , in which @entity40 ( centre ) was among the scorers of @entity0 's five goals , was watched by 86,654 fans a record low international match attendance of 40,181 turned out for @entity0 's friendly against @entity51 it took a @entity22 penalty for @entity0 to beat @entity51 in last month 's friendly international at @entity4 @entity0 's @entity75 ( left ) tries something special in @entity0 's @entity18 qualifier at @entity4 in 2009 a @entity21 strike effected the crowd in that 2009 match for which its 57,897 attendance is still the lowest for a competitive international at the national stadium			1

the @entity8 expects about 50,000 to attend @entity0 v @entity1 at @entity4
the crowd could break lowest attended competitive international record
the @entity3 qualifier kicks off at 7.45pm in @entity7
last time the two sides met there in 2012 it *attracted* 86,654 fans
apathy after @entity0 's @entity18 failure is blamed for poor crowds
