by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:39 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 07:22 est , 3 december 2012 free childcare places should be scrapped for middle - class families with help targeted at poorer children , education watchdog @entity7 claims today			1
@entity9 , the inspectorate 's national director of education , warns funding is spread ‘ very thinly ’ in offering all three - year - olds 15 hours at a nursery or childminder during term time			1
she suggests childcare should instead be funded on the same basis as the coalition ’s @entity18 in schools , where schools receive extra cash linked to the number of children from the poorest families			2
all three - year - olds are eligible for 15 hours free childcare in term time , with extra help planned for two - year - olds from poorest families			1
( file pic ) the soaring cost of childcare has become a major issue for the government , with some studies suggesting a family where a second earner takes a job on the minimum wage will be just £ 4 - a - week better off than if they stayed at home			0
family policy championed by deputy prime minister @entity44 has seen childcare provision extended to two - year - olds from the 40 per cent of least well - off families			1
but in a lecture today , ms @entity9 suggests the universal subsidy for three - year - olds is not working			1
‘ @entity55 provision has spread resources very thinly and it 's crucial that lessons are learnt from current schemes in operation , ’ she was due to say @entity52 in @entity53			2
‘ schools receive additional funding for their most disadvantaged pupils through the @entity18			0
‘ a similar scheme could work in early years to help ensure that high quality staff are employed where the two - year - old offer is most needed			1
’ from january child benefit is being cut for families where one person earns more than £ 50,000 , and any further attempt to target cuts on well - off parents will be politically - contentious			0
deputy prime minister @entity44 launched plans for the poorest two - year - olds to be offered 15 hours of free childcare ms @entity9 says a @entity18 - style funding system for under - 5s would help close the gap in learning between children from different backgrounds			1
in her speech she does not explicitly say that funding for middle class families should be cut outright , but at a time of austerity across @entity88 any attempt to target poorer children would come at a cost for others			2
she is also using @entity7 ’s first annual lecture on early years to call for nursery staff to be better trained to look after young children			2
‘ all those working with young children should be highly skilled and qualified to degree level , ’ ms @entity9 said			2
‘ if we ’re serious about investing in a better - qualified workforce we should pay more			0
nursery staff wages often hover around the minimum and even a graduate early years professional earns only half a teacher ’s salary			0
’ at the moment , individuals need higher grades to train to work as a veterinary assistant than to work with young children , she says			0
any attempt to increase the entry - level requirements for nursery workers would push up costs			1
a government - commissioned review published in june concluded that qualifications for childminders and nursery staff are failing to provide the knowledge and skills needed to care and teach young children			0
it called for a major revamp of the system with all staff educated to a-level standard			0
students should also have to have @entity129 and maths at gcse level before they begin an early education or childcare course , the @entity127 review said			0
a @entity135 spokesman said : ‘ all three and four - year - olds are already entitled to free early education			1
‘ we are expanding this entitlement so that around 130,000 two - year - olds will have 15 hours of free early years education from next september , doubling to more than a quarter of a million two - year - olds from september 2014			1
‘ we want to improve the quality of early education and childcare qualifications			0
we asked professor @entity146 to look at this and we will respond to her recommendations shortly			0

watchdog 's director of education says funding is spread too ' thinly ' and should be *focused* on poorest families
all three - year - olds get 15 hours free at a childminder or nursery in term time
coalition is also extending help to poorest two - year - olds
@entity7 also says nursery workers should be educated to degree level
