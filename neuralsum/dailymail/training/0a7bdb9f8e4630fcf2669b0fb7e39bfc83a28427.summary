by @entity0 more @entity4 departments will have to close for safety reasons as they are weeded out under a tough new hospital inspection regime , the new boss of the health watchdog has admitted			2
some hospitals ‘ will find it difficult ’ to prove their a&es are up to scratch as they come under renewed scrutiny by inspectors from the @entity11 , the regulator ’s chairman @entity12 warned			1
his comments in an exclusive interview with @entity18 raise the possibility of more fights over closures in the next two years , which could be increasingly difficult for the government in the run - up to the @entity24			2
under threat : more @entity4 departments could have to close for safety reasons under a tough new inspection regime ( file picture ) since 2007 , eight a&es across @entity31 and @entity32 have closed and a further 18 are threatened			1
many face closure on the premise that centralising services will save lives , but mr prior said the public had yet to be convinced			2
between now and @entity39 the @entity11 will be going into 18 hospital trusts , which together run 24 a&es , to undertake thorough inspections			1
six of those trusts , which run ten @entity41 , have been identified as being at high risk of providing sub-standard care			2
the @entity11 wants to have inspected all of @entity31 ’s 161 major hospital trusts by 2015			1
mr prior thought the @entity11 ’s beefed - up inspection regime , which includes doctors and nurses from elsewhere and patients going into hospitals , would find that some emergency departments were unsafe			1
@entity56 last night said the government was presiding over an ‘ unprecedented summer crisis ’ in @entity4 after new figures showed a sharp increase in waiting times			2
the number of hospital trusts missing the target of seeing 95 per cent of patients within four hours shot up from 38 to 57 – a rise of 50 per cent over last summer			2
it means that 40 per cent of @entity31 ’s biggest @entity4 departments are now missing the target			1
shadow health secretary @entity69 said : ‘ patients are given dates for their long - awaited operations , only to be put back on the waiting list as hospitals grapple with the @entity4 crisis			1
‘ @entity75 is presiding over the first summer @entity4 crisis in living memory			0
’ ‘ this may drive further reconfiguration , driven by patient safety , not driven by financial considerations , ’ he said			0
some hospitals simply did not have enough senior doctors to provide safe @entity4 care			1
‘ if you take @entity4 , the availability of consultant doctors 24/7 – or for at least 16 hours a day – is really important , ’ he added			0
‘ now it ’s bloody hard for a small hospital to provide that kind of cover , because it ’s so expensive			0
i think the reality is that some smaller a&es will find it difficult			1
’ he went on : ‘ if we are going to get reconfigurations in the @entity96 , i think it ’s much more acceptable if it ’s driven by patient safety and quality , than by financial reasons			0
’ among the six ‘ high - risk ’ trusts to be inspected soon is the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity106			0
it runs a&es at @entity109 in @entity110 and @entity111 in @entity112 , the latter due to close in 2015			1
local councillor @entity113 , of the @entity115 @entity111 campaign , said : ‘ there is truth in the argument that centralising specialist services for conditions like strokes and heart trauma save lives			0
' but there are loads of clinicians who say that for other conditions , particularly among the elderly , speed is vital			0
these people will need a consultant as soon as possible			0
i believe there ’s still a need for district general hospitals			1
’ soon to be inspected : the @entity4 at @entity109 , @entity110 , is run by the ' high - risk ' @entity103 , havering and @entity105 risk of ' financial failure ' : one of the other ' high - risk ' trusts is the @entity140 which runs the @entity4 at @entity141 , pictured another of the six ‘ high - risk ’ trusts is @entity144 – @entity31 ’s biggest – which runs three a&es in @entity146 including one at @entity141			1
@entity149 is losing £ 2 million a week and is at risk of ‘ financial failure ’ , chief executive @entity148 said recently			0
rumours are circulating among staff that @entity154 ’s @entity4 could be axed too , but this has been denied by the trust			0
on thursday , ministers announced that struggling @entity41 would get an extra £ 500 million over two years to help ease some of the pressure , although critics have dismissed the cash injection as a ‘ sticking - plaster ’ solution .			0

@entity12 @entity11 chairman says some hospitals will struggle to prove they are up to scratch
eight a&es have closed across @entity31 and @entity32 since 2007 and 18 more have been threatened
