she joined @entity40 in february 2012 and lost 17st to become a size 12 and 9st 11lb over 18 months			1
@entity6 says her sweet tooth and weight worries started as a child			1
she says , ‘ i was always bigger than my friends when i was at school			2
@entity47 used to make me healthy meals but i could n’t help eating cakes and chocolate in between and i was n’t very sporty			2
‘ i was a size 18 when i was 16 and a size 20 when i was 18 and i just kept getting bigger and bigger			1
’ ‘ luckily , i was n’t bullied but inside i wished i was as slim as my friends			2
i resigned myself to thinking maybe i was just a fat person			2
’ @entity6 blames her love of cakes on her first job as a baker between 16 and 24 years old where she got a love for sweet treats from the bakery			1
she says , ‘ i ’d bake cakes , doughnuts , tarts , buns , you name it and i have to admit making so many tempting things was too hard to resist			2
’ ‘ people used to come from miles around to get my chocolate eclairs			2
baking was a passion of mine and i ’d always eat what i made			0
’ ‘ despite sticking to healthy meals my downfall was that i was a secret eater			0
’ the catering assistant decided enough was enough after seeing this picture of herself at a wedding			0
she says she would gorge on cake - eating up to five servings a day ‘ i ’d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when i was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much i ’d had			1
’ when @entity6 was 22 and a size 18 she got married to @entity91 , 23 , an electrician and had their daughter @entity92 2 years later			1

she confesses , ‘ @entity107 loved me for me and did n’t care about my weight			0
by my thirties i resigned myself to always being big			0
’ ‘ i was lucky i did n’t have any serious health problems but the extra weight caused me to get red raw skin between my thighs where my legs rubbed and together and i was always tired			0
’ everything changed when @entity6 was 45 and she went to a friend ’s wedding in december 2010			1
on her previous eating habits , @entity6 says : ' i ¿ d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when i was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much i ¿ d had ' she says , ‘ i was a witness and i ’d made a real effort with my hair and make up and i wore a beautiful blue dress with control underwear to hold everything in			1
i thought i looked nice			0
’ ‘ but when i saw a photo of me i thought i looked like a beached whale or like the @entity138 woman because of my many spare tyres			0
’ the mum - of - one was so shocked she decided to diet			2
she had the perfect goal in mind too			0
‘ my niece announced she was getting married in september 2013 and her mum – my sister – had sadly died a few years before			2
i wanted to slim in time for her big day so she ’d be proud of me and i would n’t embarrass her			2
’ that same year @entity6 ’s daughter @entity92 , then 20 , had lost 2st on the @entity40 and it inspired the 47 - year - old to give it a go too			1
@entity6 joined her local class in march , @entity11 , in february 2012 where she followed a daily diet of three shakes in place of meals			1
she says , ‘ i thought i ’d be starving but after a few days i got used to it and the weight dropped off me			2
’ ‘ if i had a hard day my consultant @entity155 would encourage me			2
she taught me about non-food rewards like treating yourself to a new top or going and reading a good book			0
‘ i also found talking to other slimmers on diet forums helped keep me going too			0
’ the 47 - year - old can now stand in one leg of the trousers she used to wear , pictured			1
she lost her weight by using the @entity40 after her daughter had similar success using the method the 47 - year - old also joined her local gym			1
her consultant explained strenuous exercise was n’t recommended on such a low - calorie plan so @entity6 asked a personal trainer , @entity174 , to help design a toning programme of light weights and walking on the treadmill twice a week for an hour			1
she says , ‘ exercise used to be something other people did – then i really got into it and noticed it was paying off			0
’ ' my tummy was shrinking and my arms and legs looked more toned			0
’ @entity6 was losing nearly a stone a month and before long she had to use the smallest hole on her belts to hold her trousers up			1
by the summer of 2012 she ’d shed five stone but had n’t told anyone about her diet for fear she ’d fail and everyone would know			0
but if she needed any more motivation she was further spurred on when she visited a friend ’s house and went to sit down on a plastic chair in the garden			0
she recalls , ‘ the chair went crunch and it broke ! ’ ‘ it was so embarrassing			0
i could n’t believe it			0
everyone was nice about it but i was horrified			0
’ shortly after she also split her trousers while sitting at home on the sofa			0
on her new lifestyle and fantastic figure , @entity6 says : ' i love shopping now and i buy anything i fancy instead of worrying if it 'll fit or be slimming enough ' she recalls , ‘ i was determined to keep losing weight after that			1
’ by november 2013 the accountant had shrunk from a size 32 to a size 12 and lost 17st			1
she gradually phased out her daily shakes and began eating healthily with the help of her consultant			0
to her delight the weight stayed off			0
@entity6 is still a regular at the gym and goes four times a week for an hour and a half			1
it means she can callow herself a treat of the occasional slice of cake			2
she says , ‘ if it ’s a special occasion i ’ll let myself have a cake or some chocolate but i make sure i have a small amount and do n’t go back for seconds			2
’ ‘ being slim has made my confidence soar			0
i look and feel like a different person and i ’m not going back to being 26 stone again			0
’ the 47 - year - old has treated herself to some new clothes			1
she says , ‘ i ’ve got lots of dresses now in all shapes and sizes			0
i love shopping now and i buy anything i fancy instead of worrying if it ’ll fit or be slimming enough			0
’ but the biggest treat of all is being able to look in the mirror and see a new , super slim person staring back at her			0
what ’s more , @entity6 reached her goal of slimming in time for her niece ’s wedding last year			1
she recalls , ‘ i fitted in a beautiful size 12 dress by the time her big day came round			1
‘ unlike the photo from my friend ’s wedding , these snaps are ones to be proud of			0
‘ i even enjoyed a slice of wedding cake – i just made sure it was a small one ’ breakfast : bowl of @entity270 , 3 slices of toast with butter and jam			2
lunch : two sandwiches , crisps and a muffin			0
snacks : cup of tea and a slice of cake			2
