by @entity0 @entity1 is developing a ' smart ' @entity3 cover that can show emails and other notifications even when the @entity3 is switched off			1
patents reveal the new cover could include low power leds and other screen technologies to avoid draining the battery			1
another design also shows transparent sections int he case , allowing the display to be seen			1
the case would have low power displays built in , allowing basic messages or icons to be displayed without draining the battery of the @entity3 too much			1
the cover will show users notifications via shapes , symbols or words , rather than a battery draining full screen			1
depending on the priority of the alert , the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover			1
for example , if an incoming email is marked ' important , ' a letter - shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover , while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet			1
@entity1 says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts			0
' the idea is novel and would be useful to @entity3 owners who always hand - carry their tablet , though the feature would be a drain on battery life , ' the site says ,			1
' like all @entity1 patents , it is unknown when such an accessory will hit the market , if at all			0
' the patents were uncovered by @entity55			0
the patents shows different methods of creating a display			1
both the active and passive cover types are designed to transmit notifications to the user via shapes , symbols or words , rather than a battery draining full screen			1
depending on the priority of the alert , the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover			1
for example , if an incoming email is marked ' important , ' a letter - shaped icon may illuminate on a segment near the top of the cover , while a less urgent text message can be displayed near the bottom of the tablet			2
@entity1 says the existing volume buttons would be used to scroll through or dismiss alerts			0
the patent outlines several ways to show alerts			1
depending on the priority of the alerts , the visual notification can appear on different portions of the cover			2
the cover could be revealed in september , when @entity1 is expected to introduce new @entity3			1
according to reports from @entity92 , suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the next - generation @entity94 - dubbed @entity94 2 - later this month			0
it is expected to feature the @entity97 camera seen on the @entity98 , a faster processor and , most notably , it could sport @entity1 's fingerprint scanner to unlock the device			1
along with the improved security features promised on @entity104 , this could make the @entity94 2 the most secure tablet ever			0
the original @entity94 was launched on friday 1 november 2013 ( stock image shown )			0
given @entity1 's preference for launching products on a friday , a release date for the upgraded @entity94 2 of 31 october 2014 seems possible , with the company apparently gearing up for a release in @entity112 or @entity113 this year in addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner , @entity1 's @entity104 could also help boost the security of its next - generation devices			1
for example , when connecting to a @entity120 network , the software wo n't reveal your device 's @entity123 address			2
this is used to identify the device , and can be used to determine who owns it			2
@entity1 is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store			0
the tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers , or showing excessive advertising			0
according to @entity144 , production of the displays for the next - generation tablet has begun			0
this will gear it up for release in the autumn , expected to be a friday towards the end of october , bringing it in line with previous releases			1
the original @entity94 , for example , launched on friday 1 november 2013 - perhaps suggest 31 october 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release , given @entity1 ’s preference of launching products on a friday			1
the @entity157 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor , which sported a 9.7 - inch ( 24.6 centimetres ) retina lcd display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536			2
it could also have a similar thickness , of 0.3 inches ( 7.5mm ) and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz ( 470g )			0
it ’s thought the camera will be upgraded from the @entity170 version seen on the current @entity94 to the same @entity97 camera used on the @entity98			1
this could also include the isight technology that makes low - light shots easier to take , and allows for slow - motion video to be filmed			2
@entity176 - based @entity1 ( stock image shown ) is gearing up to release the latest version of its @entity94 later this year			2
rumours suggest the @entity157 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor			2
the overall size of the tablet , however , is likely to remain nearly the same inside the device , the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the @entity188 , with among @entity189 reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous @entity191			2
and finally , it is almost certain the @entity157 will use the same @entity194 fingerprint sensor to unlock the device			2
this was introduced on the @entity98 and is expected to also be used on the @entity98 6			0
a new @entity197 is also expected to be released at the same time as @entity1 's other flagship models			1
' @entity1 sees its @entity194 fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security , and with @entity204 8 on the horizon , @entity1 is opening up that technology to app developers , ' @entity199 from @entity200 tells @entity208			0
' the @entity209 will not only be more secure , but it will also make it easier for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly			1
' it ’s unlikely that @entity1 will change its winning formula too much , though			0
@entity1 's @entity98 ( pictured ) was the first phone from the tech giant to use the new @entity194 fingerprint technology			0
this is able to recognise the fingerprint of the user and , when a digit is pressed against the home button at the bottom , it allows the phone to be unlocked without entering a code ' aside from the rumoured @entity194 scanner , improvements to the camera and faster processor , @entity1 is unlikely to make other changes to the hardware			2
' expect a very similar design to the first @entity94 , with a few upgrades and perhaps another colour option			0
' in other @entity1 news , yet more pictures of @entity1 's @entity98 were revealed yesterday showing the handset side - by - side with the current @entity98			0
the leak came from former @entity239 pop star @entity238 who also leaked the @entity240 and the @entity197 ahead of their releases			1
they appear to confirm the handset will has a larger 4.7 - inch screen , and that @entity1 has moved the power button to allow the handset to be operated easily with one hand			2
the @entity98 6 shown next to the current 5s			0
it has a 4.7 - inch ( 11.9 centimetres ) screen , it is claimed , and is likely to be announced in september the @entity251 ( left ) has the same fingerprint sensor as the @entity98 ( right ) , but is noticeably larger according to @entity238 , the @entity251 comes with a 4.7 - inch ( 11.9cm ) display , more rounded than the previous models			0
he described the device as being ' very grippy ' in the hand			0
the device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours @entity1 could abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector currently used for charging			0
the leaks are the latest to hit @entity1 , all showing an identical , slimline design			0
however , @entity1 has not commented on the pictures			0
