a new study carried out at @entity1 has found rainwater - filled water barrels provide a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes capable of carrying malaria and other diseases they are a must - have for keen gardeners			1
but trendy water butts are also a magnet for mosquitoes , experts have warned			1
the rainwater - filled water barrels provide a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes capable of carrying malaria and other diseases , a @entity14 study found			1
worryingly , water butts in population - dense towns and cities are particularly suited to incubating the insect ’s larvae , raising the chances of an outbreak			2
although malaria is unlikely to take hold here , the insects could spread it from person to person - something that has not happened in the @entity14 since the 1950s			1
@entity31 , one of the types of mosquito found to favour urban water barrels , carries the most deadly form of the malaria			1
study author @entity36 , of @entity1 , told the @entity37 : ‘ the main finding is that these mosquitoes are right next to people ’s houses and the anopheles mosquito we found is a human - biting species and it can transmit malaria			1
‘ therefore , if someone comes back from their holiday with malaria and they get bitten , it could be transmitted to another person – and that is how you get outbreaks			2
’ malaria is found in more than 100 countries and some 1,500 holidaymakers bring it back with them each year			0
mosquito bites can also cause allergies , infections and just be plain irritating			0
water butts – barrels that collect rainwater from the gutters – are increasingly popular with gardeners keen to give their plants soft , untreated water			2
they also help with water conservation and get round hosepipe bans			0
but the dark , stagnant water warmed by the sun is also attractive to mosquitoes , which lay their eggs on it			0
once hatched the larvae feast on the rotting leaves , beetles and other insects that are washed into it with the rainwater			0
dr @entity36 ’s experiments showed that the insects breed more quickly in barrels placed in the town than in the country and so are present in higher numbers			0
it is thought this is because the surrounding bricks and concrete trapped heat , raising the temperature of the water by a degree or so , and speeding up the insect ’s lifecycle			0
@entity31 , one of the types of mosquito found to favour urban water barrels , carries the most deadly form of the malaria writing in the journal @entity102 , dr @entity36 , a zoologist , said : ‘ although each water butt only provides 50 - 250 litres ( 11 - 55 gallons ) of water , when combined , containers may provide a large area and create a network of easily accessible prime mosquito habitat			1
she added that the risk of infection is very low – but people should be aware of it			0
to keep the insects at bay , dr @entity36 advises buying barrels with tight lids and completely emptying them once a month			0
mosquitoes can also be deterred by pouring a layer of vegetable oil on top of the water or adding some crushed garlic			2
if all else fails , larvae be fed to fish in the garden pond			0
@entity126 , of water conservation charity waterwise , said that while water barrels are a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes , there are many more attractive places			1
he added : ‘ if you are worried , put a lid on the barrel , or put a spoonful of olive oil on top of the water twice a year			1

new study carried out at @entity1 warns of dangers of troughs
@entity145 - filled barrels provide a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes
*researchers* found anopheles , which carry the most deadly form of malaria favour urban water butts
but experts say malaria is unlikely to take hold here but warned insects could still spread the disease from person to person
worried gardeners can put a lid on barrel or a spoonful of olive oil in water
