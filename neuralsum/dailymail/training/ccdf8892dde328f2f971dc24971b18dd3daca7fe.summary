' just five days into the challenge , they hit a powerful storm in the @entity22 , forcing the four men to seek solace in the tiny 8ft by 3ft cabin - designed to hold just two - for three days			1
they were washed back east by the storm and had to spend days making up the lost distance to win the four - person category and take second place overall in the @entity57			1
' we could n't leave the cabin , it was the most horrendous thing ' , said @entity30			0
' it was morale - breaking			2

ferocious : two men were thrown overboard during a ferocious storm just five days into the challenge but they recovered to complete the race in 48 days and seven minutes but there were moments of incredible beauty too			1
former city trader mr @entity16 , from @entity73 in @entity74 , said : ' we did n't see any wildlife - in fact we did n't even see another boat - but the stars were phenomenal			1

' we talked about food so much , like burgers , milkshakes , cold coke with ice and lemon and the simple things like a bed and shower			0
' the team competed to raise money for the @entity93 , @entity94 in the @entity95 and right to play causes			0
' the @entity57 is something we feel extremely privileged to have experienced , yet would not have wished upon our worst enemies - we have been through hell and back again out there ' , added mr @entity14 , from @entity101 in @entity102			2
' most did not expect us to even get to the start line , we are delighted to have won the fours and be second out of the entire fleet			2
' we would not wish that challenge upon our worst enemies - we have been through hell and back out there two men were thrown overboard during the crossing whilst battling 40ft waves			1
racing neck and neck against friends @entity111 , the @entity11 nudged to the lead on @entity116 and stayed ahead for the duration of the nail - biting race			2
the @entity57 saw 16 teams from around the world start the race on december 4			0
with two teams airlifted to safety following capsizes and one team rescued by a passing bulk - carrier ship , only 11 teams remain in the worldâ € ™ s toughest rowing race			2

' @entity12 and @entity16 visited @entity133 on the @entity134 in @entity135 before they left , looking out at the rough @entity18 surrounding the island one last time before setting off they discussed the tough battle ahead of them			1
