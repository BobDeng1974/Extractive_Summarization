@entity0 must be so relieved to be joining up with @entity1 this week			1
at least @entity2 wo n’t hang him out to dry like @entity3 did at @entity4 on sunday			1
when you ’re starting to think the @entity1 manager has more of a grasp of in - game management than the @entity11 boss , then it ’s time to ask some serious questions of @entity3			1
but he ’s not quick , and the defender was left exposed , alone , dealing with a winger who was having a brilliant game and rinsing his man for pace every time he got the ball			1
@entity36 did n’t go across to help out , @entity35 preferred to go forward , the speed demon @entity34 stayed on the bench			0
what was the @entity11 manager actually doing ? @entity3 ’s grasp of the problems at @entity11 , which have led to the team losing a three - goal lead at home to @entity45 , and then losing a game they were winning at @entity4 , is virtually non-existent			1
@entity47 ( left ) ca n't hide his dismay after @entity4 score a second goal against @entity11 @entity11 manager @entity3 watches his side lose 2 - 1 away to @entity4 on sunday to back this up let me give you a selection of quotes from @entity3 which were posted on the official @entity11 website after the @entity4 defeat ... wenger : ' we were quite solid defensively and did n’t look in the need to change			1
' so he could n’t see how exposed @entity17 was ? wenger : ' i think he ( @entity36 ) had a decent game			2
' and then on @entity47 : ' he did n’t have the best game today			0
' after those answers , do you trust his judgment of a player ’s performance ? wenger : ' we were struggling a bit on the right side but i have no experienced players on the bench			0
i do n’t think there was a need to change			0
' there was clearly a need to change			0
but bringing on @entity81 for @entity17 in the final minute was laughable			0
and why were there no experienced players on the bench ? because @entity3 ’s squad management and transfer policy are so excruciatingly pathetic			1
letting @entity88 go was bad , failing to replace him was shocking			0
wenger : ' the free kick is difficult to predict he would score from there			0
it ’s not like we gave a great goal chance away			0
i feel the free - kick was a bit harsh			2
' @entity98 ( second left ) rises above the @entity11 defence to put @entity4 2 - 1 ahead @entity98 looks elated as he runs away after scoring what proved to be the winner for @entity4 it was a free kick 25 yards out ! why is it difficult to predict @entity104 could score from there ? this is a player who has scored free kicks from that distance for club and country in the past ( for @entity112 away to @entity113 last year , for @entity4 at @entity114 in march 2012 , for @entity115 against @entity4 and at @entity116 )			1
so how come @entity3 was n’t aware ? given @entity104 ’s quality , a free kick conceded 25 yards from goal was obviously a ' great goal chance '			1
and was it harsh ? @entity122 was guilty of sliding in , nowhere near the ball , and bringing down a player as @entity4 broke away			2
and when asked why @entity126 have made such a good start , @entity3 ’s reply was : ' there is no obvious reason			2
' @entity104 ( left ) fires a free kick towards goal to claim the equaliser for @entity4 the reasons are clear : @entity136 identifying @entity126 ’s weaknesses and solving them with two signings , one of whom was a player @entity11 could have signed but did n’t , allowing the @entity140 to take him			1
the answers @entity3 gives could possibly be twisted by his more deluded supporters into some sort of desperate attempt to protect his players			2
the @entity11 manager needed to protect his teenage right back on sunday , but failed to do so			1
the irony is that despite the game being played in front of him , @entity3 does not see it			2
old habits die hard , i suppose			0
he used to be brilliant			0
but he is n’t any more .			0

@entity11 lost 2 - 1 away to @entity4 in the @entity155 on sunday
@entity0 has been called up to the @entity1 squad for the @entity159 *qualifier* against @entity113 and *friendly* away to @entity160
the @entity11 right - back was left exposed at the @entity23
@entity3 's grasp of the problems at @entity11 is virtually non-existent
