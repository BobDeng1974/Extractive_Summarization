for @entity1 , the annual @entity0 was one of the most exciting events of the year			2
but now , with dictator @entity6 shelving plans for 2015 due to lack of funds for lack of funds , people will have to look elsewhere for entertainment			1
' it was billed as one of the biggest and most impressive performances in the world , ' explains photographer @entity15 who attended the last @entity0 in 2013			1
' all over @entity17 you could see @entity0 adverts talking about the " grand mass gymnastic and artistic performances " which the regime said even the opening ceremony for the @entity23 could n't better			0
designed to promote the @entity46 , the armed forces and the @entity6 dynasty , the @entity0 started life in 1946 and was , from the start , littered with regime iconography			1
rising suns , which represent @entity27 , feature heavily in the costumes , as do guns which are a reference to @entity27 passing ' the struggle ' on to his son @entity55 and grandson @entity6			0
flowers are a popular prop , with red representing workers and purple the @entity6 dynasty			1
unsurprisingly , many are @entity28 , a type of purple orchid , and @entity63 , a crimson begonia			1
big day : the event was held at @entity17 's main stadium and usually had a military flavour free pass : soldiers were given free tickets to the event as a reward for good behaviour celebration : the military personnel were there to see the army - and the ruling @entity77 - celebrated practice : in the months leading up to the event , @entity17 was the scene of regular drills getting it right : instructors with loudspeakers told the massed ranks of gymnasts exactly what to do result : the colourful spectacle that ensued was the result of months of training symbolism : many of the dances symbolised workers , with apples and girls in iridescent dresses seen here standing in for farmers tribute : other tableaux focused on the @entity6 dynasty			1
these gymnasts are holding @entity103 - a type of crimson begonia colour symbolism : these sailors are followed by gymnasts holding @entity109 and purple fans - both representative of the regime @entity6 's colours : clutching @entity103 and dressed in purple , these gymnasts are advertising their loyalty to the regime tough job : many of the performers , in particularly the gymnasts , are drawn from local schools armed forces : attractive female soldiers also play a big role in proceedings , their job to highlight the armed forces impressive : another highlight of the @entity0 were the mass military parades - complete with giant flags popular : all members of the armed forces were represented , whether sailors , soldiers or pilots but propaganda aside , what really makes the @entity0 stand out are the sheer numbers involved			1
' 100,000 athletes took part in the show i saw , ' explains @entity15			2
' then , there were 20,000 teenagers sitting at the back of the stadium holding cards and making pictures			0
to make a soldier , 2000 of them were needed while it took all 20,000 to make a @entity1 flag			0
' @entity152 - inspiring though the sight was , @entity15 says some of the people - art hints at @entity1 's more sinister ambitions			0
' some of them showed atoms , which symbolise the nuclear bomb , while others showed the two @entity161 together under the @entity6 dynasty 's rule			2
' the show also has a military flavour , with sexy female soldiers in uniforms and garters sent out to dance in front of troops , mostly men , who had been given a free pass to the show as a reward for good behaviour			0
despite its massive scale , the @entity0 lasts for just one hour with attendees going straight home afterwards			0
' all the thousands of people in the stadium just vanished into the streets , ' @entity15 recalls			2
' @entity17 's streets are really dark and quiet so the contrast with the stadium was almost shocking			0
it felt very unreal , like being in a terrifying and fantastic alternate universe			0
' surreal : whirling gymnasts in green and white combine to create a psychedelic scene well - rehearsed : a group of girls , all dressed in @entity77 purple , march en masse extraordinary : thousands of performers take part in each @entity0 , although the future is now uncertain one for the workers : the colour red is also used to symbolise the workers , @entity201 and the @entity202 pretty : rows of dancers clutching fans designed to look like @entity28 orchids perform at the @entity0 unusual combination : each segment combined dance and gymnastics with the marching military alternate universe : photographer @entity15 says watching the performances was like being in a different universe elaborate : this scene references @entity55 's birth , which , according to @entity1 myth , took place in a mountain log cabin showing allegiance : this tableaux features the @entity223 flag , complete with the hammer and sickle once used by the @entity226 ( now @entity227 ) vast : the @entity0 take over @entity229 's central stadium for the last time in 2013			1
