dame @entity2 , an outspoken critic of government funding cuts to the arts , will fire a parting blast at ministers at the event at the @entity18 tonight in front of an audience drawn from the great and the good in the arts world			1
the event is going ahead despite the @entity22 initially turning down a request from the @entity10 to use taxpayers ’ money			2
the quango got round the decision by reclassifying the event under an existing part of its budget which had already been approved for funding			2
the original £ 12,500 budget for the event included a catering bill of £ 7,500 to pay for each of the 250 guests to enjoy an average two - and - a - half glasses of wine and five canapés			0
a further £ 1,000 was earmarked for ‘ contingencies ’			0
an @entity10 spokesman last night denied the event was a ‘ leaving do ’ and said the final budget had been reduced to £ 8,130			1
but a government source condemned the decision to press ahead with the ‘ party ’			2
the source said : ‘ it ’s unbelievable that the @entity10 would complain about arts funding and then , instead of bidding for extra money for front - line arts , ask the government for £ 12,500 of taxpayers ’ money to fund an extravagant leaving party			1
‘ it makes you question their priorities if they think this is a good use of money			0
’ @entity62 , of the @entity63 ’ @entity61 , added : ‘ this is yet another example of a taxpayer - funded body that is out of touch with the people who pick up their bills			0
it smacks of hypocrisy for the @entity10 to decry necessary spending cuts when it is more than happy to splash out on a luxurious goodbye bash			1
venue : the event is going ahead at the @entity18 despite the @entity22 initially turning down a request from the @entity10 to use taxpayers ' money ‘ this unelected and unaccountable quango should be axed before it wastes any more taxpayers ’ money quaffing champagne			1
’ the council last night defended the decision to press ahead with the event , which is now part of its ‘ @entity90 ’ series of lectures on the value of the arts			0
' this unelected and unaccountable quango should be axed before it wastes any more taxpayers ' money quaffing champagne ' @entity62 , @entity61 dame @entity2 , a former @entity93 executive and chairman of the @entity95 which owns the @entity97 newspaper , will deliver a speech making the case for ‘ sustained government investment in arts and culture ’			1
she will also stress the importance of including cultural education as a key element of the government ’s new @entity107 qualification			0
the council spokesman described the occasion as a ‘ thought leadership piece which will help stimulate debate and discussion among the key stakeholders present , and those who hear the podcast of the event , around key priorities for the @entity10 ’			2
the spokesman said costs had been ‘ kept to a minimum ’ , adding that the event would also be an opportunity for ‘ discussion and networking ’			0
dame @entity2 was appointed as chairman of the @entity10 in 2009 but was asked to step down by the then culture secretary @entity127 when her term came up for renewal last year			1
her departure was mourned by administrators who saw her as an effective champion of public spending on the arts			0
she is being succeeded by sir @entity135 , the man who will forever be known for introducing @entity136 to @entity138 television .			0

dame @entity2 , the outgoing head of the @entity10 , is an outspoken critic of government cuts to arts funding
she has come under fire over a planned ' leaving party ' at the @entity18 tonight at a cost of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer
