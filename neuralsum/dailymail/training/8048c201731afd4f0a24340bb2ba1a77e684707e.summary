political mascot - turned - gun - *advocate* @entity139 ' @entity15 wrote an open letter to *grieving* parents who lost their children to mass - murderer @entity28
' as harsh as this sounds , ' he insisted on a conservative blog , ' your dead kids do n't trump my constitutional rights ' to own guns
@entity15 was responding to @entity30 , who blamed his son 's death on the @entity31 and ' craven , irresponsible politicians '

the crass letter , he wrote , was n't directed at the parents of @entity28 's stabbing victims
