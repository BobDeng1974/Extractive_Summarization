@entity0 approved a $ 100,000 investment that pushes the envelope - not to mention sound barriers - when it comes to plane design			0
the space organization approved the hefty fund to allow for further development of a new type of aircraft called the supersonic plane concept			1
the plane is created in a way that will allow it to take off from the ground , and then turn on its side once it reaches supersonic atmospheric levels so that it can continue its flight into the uppermost parts of space			1
@entity40 reports that when the plane takes off from the ground , it has to have the longer wings on either side , making the plane appear shorter in length and longer in width			0
researcher : dr. @entity49 , a professor at the @entity50 , is behind the project and will continue to run tests it is for this reason that normal commercial airplanes have such significant wings , because they need to use that wingspan to gain enough momentum to get off of the ground			1
by contrast , while the large wingspan is needed to take off , it creates too much drag for the plan when it reaches supersonic speeds			0
as a result , once it reaches the supersonic atmosphere , the plane will then rotate 90 degrees so that it is longer and thinner than when it took off			2
the technology has been pioneered by dr. @entity49 who is a teacher at the @entity50			2
the school has an animated video of the plane in flight - equipped with the @entity50 's logo on the wings - to give a fuller idea of the shift and at what point that would happen during the flight			1
@entity40 reports that the recently - approved award from @entity0 will allow the @entity82 and his aides to continue their research and refine it using simulations and wind tunnel testing			0
while the funding will give the research an obvious boost , it is still expected to take decades before any form of said plane becomes a reality .			0

plane can fly on two of its sides and travel to supersonic levels
