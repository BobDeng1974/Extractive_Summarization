a pastor from @entity1 , @entity2 , has produced an inventive - and hilarious - video , which seeks to educate people on how they can better phrase their questions to adoptive families , in order to avoid causing offense			2
@entity10 , 36 , the father of two biological sons and one adopted daughter , @entity12 , two , has made a three minute @entity14 tutorial on the matter , using an unlikely analogy to illustrate his point			1
' if you would n’t say it about a boob job , do n't say it about an adoptive family ' , he reasons			2
happy family : mr @entity10 , 36 , says he wants to protect his adopted daughter , @entity12 , 2 ( pictured with his two biological sons ) , from hurtful comments when she grows up the video , billed as ' a public service announcement from adoptive families everywhere ' , has scored over 18,500 views and a rapturous applause since it was uploaded earlier this week , and stars mr @entity10 playing a number of comedy roles himself			1
in it , he re-enacts some of the things people have said to him in regards to his daughter , who was born in @entity40			2
' are those real ? ' he feigns , leering at a woman 's chest			1
and then , to the same woman holding his daughter , ' is that your real daughter ? ! ' jokester : mr @entity10 ( pictured ) has created a @entity14 video which seeks to educate people on the right way to talk about adoption acting skills : in the three minute video tutorial , mr @entity10 re-enacts , to hilarious effect , some of the real things people have to said to him about his daughter @entity12 , 2 at which point , mr @entity10 steps in to respond to the inquiry			1
' yup , she 's real , she 's not a unicorn , ' he says , deadpan , before instructing his audience that their correct phrasing should be : ' is she your biological daughter ? ' ' @entity68 , where 'd you get those ? ' he squeals animatedly in the next clip , pointing at the woman 's chest , and then , indicating his daughter : ' where did you get her from ? ' to which mr @entity10 responds : ' as adorable as she is , my daughter actually is n't a ' trendy accessory			1
' the correct question in this instance ? ' where is she from ? ' according to the proud dad			2
precious : this touching photo was taken of little @entity12 touching her soon - to - be father 's face , captured before he officially adopted her when juxtaposing the question of whether the woman got to ' pick out ' her own boobs , to someone asking whether he got to ' pick ' the daughter he wanted , the pastor - turned - jokester has an amusing response			0
' nope , we did n't actually go and haggle ... and try to find the cutest little red - headed orphan			0
that only happens in musicals , ' he says			0
the question we should be asking , he points out , is : ' how does the adoption process actually work ? ' excitement : mr @entity10 , with his wife @entity101 ( right ) , in a snap they shared on @entity105 while they were on their way to pick up baby @entity12 he concludes his lessons in the art of delicacy with a somewhat poignant comparison			1
' aww , did you get them because you could n't have boobs of your own ? ' he asks , with mock pity			0
and then warns : ' this is probably a question you want to avoid altogether			0
' because adoption is n't always the result of infertility - and even if it was , it 's none of your business			0
' mr @entity10 and his wife @entity121 were inspired to create the tutorial after one of their first outings with @entity12 , to a restaurant , was interrupted by the insensitive questions from the couple 's waitress			1
the new father spoke to @entity131 about the incident			0
' i really , really , really do n’t think that people are trying to be mean , ' he maintains			1
adoption is n't always the result of infertility - and even if it was , it 's none of your business ' people are curious , that ’s human nature and it ’s natural to ask questions , ' he goes on			0
' so we were thinking , what ’s a way that we could help people just put language around it ? ' he shrugs off the suggestion that he should n't be talking about ' boob jobs ' , revealing that he ' appreciates real talk ' , and relished the opportunity to inject humor into a positive and important message			1
' the truth is ... i ’m trying to be incredibly protective of my daughter who does n’t understand [ the comments ] yet , ' he says			0
' but at one point , she will , and the last thing i want her to feel is that she is a lesser member of my family			0
