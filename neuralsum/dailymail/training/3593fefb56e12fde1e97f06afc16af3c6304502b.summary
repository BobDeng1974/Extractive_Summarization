by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 09:02 est , 24 december 2012 @entity2 's top civilian cyber defender : @entity3 , 26 , from @entity4 finished second overall in the 2012 @entity5 a @entity7 software developer has been named the world 's top civilian computer security expert in a competition run by the @entity12 military			1
@entity3 , 26 , from @entity4 finished as the highest - ranked civilian and second overall in the 2012 @entity5 , held by the @entity12 @entity14			1
he beat competition from almost 2,000 cyber defenders from 53 countries , losing out only to a professional team from multibillion pound @entity12 aerospace and defence firm @entity19			1
the final standings provided further good news for the health of the country ’s home - grown cyber talent pool as the @entity7 contributed more participants than almost any other country			1
two more @entity7 amateurs , @entity30 and @entity31 , finished in the top 12			1
the @entity32 is a global competition designed and hosted by the @entity12 @entity34			1
considered one of the toughest forensic competitions in the world , it takes the form of scenario - based exercises replicating the complexity digital forensics examiners face extracting and scrutinising data to solve cybercrime			2
areas covered include file signatures , hashing metadata , data hiding , communication recovery , and information concealment			0
@entity3 is a computer science graduate , a former web developer , and the co-founder of @entity54 , a start - up he set up in 2009 with a school friend to tackle various projects using their software expertise			2
@entity54 ’s latest project , @entity60 , represents the world ’s largest collection of hotel data collected into a single system			0
despite his obvious talents with information technology , success in the @entity32 competition came as a surprise and has prompted him to start applying for his first job in cyber security			2
mr @entity3 's success has made him eligible to take part in the @entity74 @entity7 : here a team tackle the challenge in an event this year the man who hacked email accounts belonging to a swath of a-list celebrities including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 has been sentenced to 10 years in prison			1
@entity86 , 36 , pleaded guilty to nine felony counts earlier this year - including identity theft , wiretapping , and unauthorized access - after he leaked several nude and revealing photos of the women online			0

' he was hunted down by federal agents using a battering ram to his run - down brick home home which he had once shared with his late grandmother			0
the depth of his hacking - which kept the unemployed @entity93 glued to his computer screen for days at a time - enabled him to witness exchanges between celebrities , their family members and their doctors			0
in all he was accused of illegally accessing the private information of around 50 stars with virtually no technical computer training			0
' it ’s a year - long competition but i only decided to enter a month before it closed so time was a bit of an issue , ' mr @entity3 said			1
' i looked through all 34 challenges and wrote a plan of how to do them all and how long it would take			0
' it ’s all certainly possible to solve but it ’s not easy and you have to think carefully about the time required for each challenge			0
' security has always been an interest			0
at school i would publish computer security and operating system design tutorials			0
however setting up my own company left me with less time to pursue this interest			0
' the @entity74 has certainly reignited my love for cyber security and problem solving			2
i did better than i expected , and it ’s given me a boost to start applying for work in this field			0
' @entity147 , director of futures exploration at the @entity34 said : ' this year ’s @entity32 saw the highest ever number of players and submissions , and a significant increase in the standard of the competition			0
' all this makes @entity3 ’s achievement - finishing second as an individual , and beating teams of professionals from some of the largest companies in the world and government ’s cyber workforces - all the more remarkable			1
' mr @entity3 's success in the @entity32 competition has also booked him a place to take part in the next competition run by @entity74 @entity7 , the @entity170 in january			1
there 30 talented amateurs from various virtual first stage challenge competitions will take on the role of forensics and defence specialists working for the @entity177 facing attack from both both cyber criminal gangs and hostile nations			2
he will be joined at the @entity170 by his fellow top ranked @entity7 candidates from the @entity32 competition , it professional @entity182 , who finished ninth and @entity31 , a fourth - year student at @entity183 , who finished 12th , the highest ranked undergraduate in the world			1
next step : thirty talented amateurs from various virtual first stage challenge competitions will take on the role of forensics and defence specialists working for the @entity177 @entity191 , ceo of @entity74 @entity7 , said : ' @entity3 ’s success in this global competition and the performance of @entity7 competitors more generally is a powerful demonstration of the level of amateur talent we have here in the @entity7			1
' unfortunately for a profession like cyber security where employers are desperate to find new talent , @entity3 ’s story of an early interest in the subject that was n’t pursued in later life is worryingly familiar			2
' without the opportunities provided by the competitions like the @entity32 and the @entity74 @entity7 , @entity3 and many others like him will be lost to the profession completely despite their undoubted ability			1

@entity3 from @entity4 lost out only to a professionals team from @entity12 defence giant @entity19
