by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 11 december 2013 happy couple : @entity2 and fiance @entity3 say they are ' ecstatic ' after @entity6 judges ruled they can get married in a @entity8 chapel a couple say they are ' ecstatic ' after judges in the @entity13 's highest court ruled they can get married in a @entity8 chapel			1
bride - to - be @entity2 had appealed to the @entity6 after a high court judge ruled that services run by @entity17 were not ' acts of worship '			1
the @entity6 judges overturned the ban , meaning overjoyed @entity20 and her fiance @entity3 can start planning their dream wedding at the chapel in central @entity23			1
miss @entity2 , 25 , said : ' i am really excited			2
i 'm really glad we are finally being treated equally and can now get married in our church			1
' she said they hoped to get married in the next few months but have yet to set a date			0
five @entity6 justices analysed the case at a hearing in @entity23 in july and ruled in miss @entity2 's favour today , announcing that the @entity8 church was a ' place of meeting for religious worship '			1
she took legal action after the registrar general of births , deaths and marriages refused to register the @entity43 for the solemnisation of marriages under the @entity46 - because it was not a place for ' religious worship '			1
@entity6 justices said religion should not be confined to faiths involving a ' supreme deity '			0
they said the @entity8 held religious services , therefore its church was a ' place of meeting for religious worship '			1
mr @entity3 said : ' i think the court 's definition of religion is excellent			2
i think it 's what most people today would understand ' religion ' to be			0
' @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 unanimously allowed miss @entity2 's appeal against the @entity73 ruling			1
in 1970 the @entity8 launched a similar case when the @entity75 ruled that @entity8 did not involve religious worship because there was no ' veneration of @entity79 or of a @entity79 '			1
miss @entity80 and mr @entity3 , both volunteers at the church near the @entity83 in central @entity23 , had appealed the decision to block the wedding in july 2011 as they saw it as unlawful religious discrimination			1
' at the hearing @entity109 of @entity110 , appearing for @entity20 and the @entity111 , said she and her fiance wanted to celebrate their marriage through a legally recognised @entity8 wedding in @entity23 , surrounded by their families and fellow church volunteers			1
@entity109 said there had been a failure to have proper regard to evidence that the form of worship observed by @entity17 had continued to evolve and now was materially different from what it had been previously			0
but last year the judge said he was bound by previous legal rulings and even the @entity129 did not provide a basis to rule differently			0
challenge : miss @entity2 and mr @entity3 , both volunteers at the church near the @entity83 in central @entity23 , had appealed the decision to block the wedding in july 2011 as they saw it as unlawful religious discrimination miss @entity2 lost her @entity73 fight in december 2012 when mr @entity138 said he was bound by the 1970 @entity75 decision and therefore had to dismiss her challenge			1
but he said @entity6 judges should consider the question of whether @entity17 worshipped			0
he said that because the @entity6 was a more senior court than the @entity75 , @entity6 judges might take a different view			0
bride - to - be : scientologist @entity2 said she was ' really excited ' to be getting married after the @entity6 ruled in her favour miss @entity2 argued that the 1970 ruling should not be binding because @entity148 beliefs and services had evolved during the past four decades			1
she said services were ' ones of religious worship ' and likened @entity8 to @entity152 and @entity153			1
miss @entity2 said : ' my fiance and i have always believed in the fairness of the @entity13 legal process			2
' it 's been a long and demanding journey , but the @entity6 's decision today has made it all worthwhile			0
' we are really excited that we can now get married , and thank our family and friends for all of their patience and support			0
' her solicitor @entity168 , a partner at law firm @entity170 , said : ' the @entity6 's judgment is a victory for the equal treatment of religions in the modern world			0
' we are delighted at the outcome - it always felt wrong that @entity2 was denied the simple right , afforded to members of other religions , to enjoy a legal marriage ceremony in her own @entity8			1
' communities secretary @entity182 had welcomed mr @entity138 's ruling			0
mr @entity182 said the @entity8 might have been entitled to ' tax breaks ' - because of rules governing places of public worship - had a decision gone in its favour			1
he said taxpayers would not want ' such a controversial organisation ' to get ' special ' treatment			0
local government minister @entity193 said his department would be taking legal advice following the ruling			2
he said : ' i am very concerned about this ruling , and its implications for business rates			0
' in the face of concerns raised by conservatives in @entity206 , @entity202 ministers told @entity207 during the passage of the @entity209 that @entity8 would continue to fall outside the religious exemption for business rates			1
but we now discover @entity8 may be eligible for rate relief and that the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill , all thanks to @entity217 and @entity202 's flawed laws			1
' hard - pressed taxpayers will wonder why @entity8 premises should now be given tax cuts when local firms have to pay their fair share			2
' we will review the court 's verdict and discuss this with our legal advisers before deciding the next steps			0
however , it will remain the case that premises which are not genuinely open to the public will not qualify for tax relief			0
' venue : the @entity43 , where @entity20 and mr @entity3 now plan to marry since 2005 a new law enabled couples in @entity13 to marry in premises approved by local authorities , such as hotels and stately homes - rather than just a church or registry office			1
civil marriage venues have since been expanded to include pubs , football grounds , wine distilleries , and other places far removed from a traditional church setting			0
the case was of particular importance to the @entity8 and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past			2
miss @entity2 argued that the 1970 ruling should not be binding on any court because @entity148 beliefs and services had evolved during the past 42 years			1
celebrity : famous scientologists include actors @entity261 , left , and @entity263 , right she said services were ' ones of religious worship ' and likened @entity8 to @entity152 and @entity153			1
@entity8 is a controversial religious belief system that teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature			1

@entity272 wrote that 75 million years ago , an alien ruler called @entity275 brought billions of his people to @entity277 in a spaceship before killing them in a bomb blast , leaving their spirits to wander around and harm the living			0
according to @entity272 , following @entity8 means you can be clear of these malevolent spirits			1
@entity8 describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself , others , and all of life			2
one purpose of @entity8 , as stated by the @entity8 , is to become certain of one 's spiritual existence and one 's relationship to @entity79 , or the ' @entity79			2
' @entity17 believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing , sight , touch , taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as ' perceptics '			0
these include an ability to sense blood circulation , balance , compass direction , temperature , gravity as well as an ' awareness of importance , unimportance			0
' in order to ascend up the @entity8 ladder , followers must complete a number of courses and be ' @entity320 ' in @entity321			2
this is a state , according to @entity272 , when a human ' no longer has his own reactive mind and therefore suffers none of the ill - effects that the reactive mind can cause			0
' the @entity8 believes that humans suffer unwanted and negative feelings , which lead to illnesses			2
if every person applies @entity321 in their life , they can be ' @entity320 ' , or free , of these feelings and therefore avoid sickness			0
the next stage is to achieve @entity337 levels , or ots for short			0
there are eight levels before the truth of @entity8 can be fully revealed			2
it is believed that actor @entity261 took five years to reach this level .			0
