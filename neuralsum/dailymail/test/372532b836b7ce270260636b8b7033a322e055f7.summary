@entity8 has labelled the security checks ' ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation			2
mr @entity0 , a software engineer , said : ' fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four - year - old			1
' we were so late by this point i did n't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we did n't want to miss our flight			0
' i explained to @entity0 we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday			2
we were going for 10 days in @entity14 over @entity43			2
' i thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time			0
' no wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid			0
