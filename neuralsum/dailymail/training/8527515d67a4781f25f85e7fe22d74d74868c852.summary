by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 attorney - general @entity3 is under pressure after prime minister @entity5 decided to back down on plans to water down the @entity7 without telling him			1
the controversial changes to the act , which were discussed for over six months , had been ridiculed by the opposition , ethnic leaders , the public and his own party			2
the @entity5 government wanted to reform section @entity16 of the act after @entity19 was found to have breached the act with a @entity22 column			2
the amendments would have scrapped a prohibition on offending , insulting or humiliating individuals based on race			1
attorney general @entity3 was told by @entity5 on tuesday morning that his legislation to change the racial discrimination act had to be dropped on his radio show on tuesday , @entity19 attacked former @entity32 premier @entity31 after the disgraced politician slammed his comments criticising mr @entity5 's decision not to repeal @entity16			1
' hello to @entity31 ... pour yourself another expensive red , one you might have forgotten you actually had there , ' he said on @entity40 's @entity39 , prompting laughter from his co-host @entity42			2
@entity19 was referring to the scandal that brought down mr @entity31 , when he was forced to admit he gave inaccurate evidence to a corruption inquiry about receiving a bottle of @entity48 wine from a lobbyist			2
mr @entity31 had tweeted during the radio show , condemning @entity19 's strong criticism of the government 's decision , saying the comments were ' so irrational they 're almost humorous '			2
in a newspaper column , called ' it 's so hip to be black ' , @entity19 wrote : ' meet the white face of a new black race — the political @entity60			2
' the @entity63 columnist was allegedly briefed on the backdown and hour before the public were told of it , the @entity61 reports			2
but on his radio show , he said : ' what he is saying is the very people , the very ethnic groups that would take exception to @entity72 are the same ones that are , in part , some of them , affected or take offence to the anti-terrorism legislation			1
' to make them feel not picked on he 'll retain laws against free speech , ' @entity19 said			2
attorney - general @entity3 has previously said @entity83 have a ' right to be bigots ' when defending his changes			1
the repeal of @entity72 , an @entity89 election commitment , has been widely criticised as a watering down of protections against racism			1
@entity93 of the act makes it unlawful to offend , insult , humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of race , colour or national or ethnic origin			1
more than 5500 submissions flooded into the attorney - general 's office following the release of draft laws in march			2
only a handful have been released but the majority reportedly opposed the changes			2
a government source told the @entity61 the changes were to keep ' the moderate @entity114 ' onside			2
' the purpose of the exposure draft was to get community feedback and the feedback has been " do n't change it "			2
as part of combating terrorism , we want the moderate @entity114 community to be onside			0
one of the sticking points has been @entity16 , ' they said			0
@entity19 was one of the first to comment on the government 's announcement on tuesday , blaming the move on lobby groups who ' hate free speech ' an april poll published by @entity134 showed 88 per cent of respondents believed it should be illegal to offend , insult or humiliate someone based on their race			1
the @entity140 admitted the proposed changes to section @entity72 of the act had ' complicated ' relations with ethnic groups			1
coalition backbenchers joined the opposition , and @entity148 leader @entity147 says that 's why the ' deeply unpopular ' changes have been ditched			0
' what is clear ... is that the attorney - general has been rolled by his cabinet , ' mr @entity147 told reporters			0
the government had been humiliated and embarrassed by the proposal , he said , which was flagged one year ago			0
' this has been a dreadful waste of national energy , ' the opposition leader said			0
the @entity161 have repeatedly questioned the government 's motive behind the changes , after political commentator @entity19 fell foul to @entity72 for a column questioning the motives of lighter - skinned @entity168 people			1
mr @entity19 was one of the first to comment on the government 's announcement on tuesday , blaming the move on lobby groups who " hate free speech "			0
' i suspect the country will be poorer for this , ' he said			0
the government may have backed down on @entity16 of the @entity7 , but mr @entity5 reconfirmed the law needed to changed			1
' but i want the communities of our country to be our friend , not our critic , ' he said			0
' i want to work with the communities of our country as ' @entity186 ' here			0
' the government 's perfectly reasonable attempt to amend @entity72 has become a complication we just do n't need and we wo n't proceed with , ' he added			1
the pm announced dramatic new anti-terror laws , which aim to stop the increasing number of @entity83 heading overseas to join terrorist fighters			1
it will also include the expansion of the definition of terrorism beyond ' terrorist activities ' to threats on social media			0
' these are provisions , that for a person who travels to a designated spot identified as a terrorist hostile area , will be a crime , ' mr @entity5 said			0
foreign minister @entity214 said that in @entity215 , up to 30 @entity83 had been identified as fighting alongside extremists but ' five times that number are now of interest , fighting overseas or becoming involved '			1
@entity5 confirmed that the new definition would encompass the behaviour of social media jihadists such as @entity222 , who has tweeted pictures of himself holding decapitated heads , and make them liable for prosecution			0
the announcement of the new laws and an extra $ 630 million in government spending on anti-terrorist measures , comes as @entity222 , the 30 - year - old former boxer fighting with terrorists in the @entity232 , posted claims of how to access deadly explosives in @entity40			0
the 30 - year - old invited jihadists in @entity40 to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades			0
' anyone in @entity40 who is after explosives ( dynamite sticks , c4 sticks , orica mine sticks , grenades ) lots more			0
if interested @entity245 me , ' he tweeted			0
the new law is part of a suite of measures introduced by the government , under which @entity83 could be arrested for travelling to certain terrorist ' hot spots ' without a valid humanitarian reason , causing fears that the onus of proof will rest on @entity83 who visit these areas to prove they did so innocently			1
one of the most controversial proposed measures would see the phone and internet records of all @entity83 held for two years			1
this would apply to metadata , rather than the content of calls and emails			0
metadata is information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers , email addresses and the dates , times , locations and duration of phone calls			0
under the new laws , the tweets of @entity83 jihadist @entity222 could be classed as terrorism @entity222 invited followers on @entity281 to contact him about obtaining explosives in @entity40 fighting in @entity283 : @entity222 is believed to have left @entity83 last year to fight in @entity283 during criminal or intelligence investigations this content can be accessed , though monitoring phone or internet use over a long period requires a warrant			1
attorney - general @entity3 said last week that data collection and surveillance was necessary for dealing with the ' insidious threat ' of home - grown terrorism			1
the laws have drawn criticism from @entity148 , the @entity161 and civil rights groups			0
opposition leader @entity147 said the changes had been forced on the prime minister and attorney - general , claiming that ‘ @entity3 has been humiliated by his colleagues ’			1
‘ today ’s back down to allow bigots to be bigots , is a victory for ordinary people , ’ mr @entity147 added			1
‘ his ( @entity3 ’ ) priority as attorney - general has allowed racists to be racist			1
’ @entity308 , acting leader of the @entity161 acting leader said the test for any data retention or surveillance should be whether a person is ' reasonably suspected of having committed a crime '			0
' to simply say everything you do online will be stored now and made available to government is over-reach , ' mr @entity308 said			0
this is the second suite of anti-terror laws introduced by the government in recent months			0
in july the government introduced legislation that could allow @entity83 police and security agencies powers to conduct surveillance in foreign countries and tender the evidence in @entity83 courts as part of prosecution in terrorism cases			1
the laws will allow police to conduct surveillance against @entity83 who go abroad to join jihadist movements such as the @entity334 ( @entity334 ) , pictured marching in @entity283 the law would apply to countries where it was impossible to gain consent from local authorities such as countries in the grip of civil war , like @entity283 , or ‘ failed states ’ like @entity344			1
other changes include the power to suspend people 's passports in order to disrupt their travel plans at short notice and allowing the @entity352 to pass on intelligence about @entity83 to its domestic counterpart , @entity355 , under certain circumstances			1
the changes are meant to address the changes to technology which have rendered some current surveillance and eavesdropping laws outdated and the rise of jihadism .			0

@entity3 previously said @entity83 have a ' right to be bigots ' when defending his change
