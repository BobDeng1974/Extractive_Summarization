by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 10 april 2013 @entity2 joke : @entity3 , right , hired a foam cannon to cover @entity6 's garden with 6ft of bubbles while she was out shopping some of us have nice neighbours , some of us have noisy neighbours , but few of us have neighbours who will cover our gardens with foam while we 're at the shops			1
for mother - of - three @entity6 , however , it was absolutely par for the course when she came back from the supermarket to discover @entity3 's latest prank			1
because the two friends - who live next door to each other in a village in north wales - have been playing tricks on each other for years in the most recent incident mr @entity3 , 65 , hired a foam cannon and covered mrs @entity6 's garden ( which he knew to be her pride and joy ) with a carpet of white bubbles six feet deep			1
mrs @entity6 , 50 , was so stunned to come home and see her bungalow looking more like an @entity38 chalet , she did n't immediately work out who the culprit was			1
she said : ' for a moment , i thought i 'd left my washing machine on and that it had gone crazy			0
' i jsut could n't work it out until i heard my neighbours giggling from behind a hedge			0
' thankfully , she saw the funny side and joined her neighbours , who 'd been hiding to watch her reaction , as they all waded into the suds and enjoyed a giant foam party			0
the care worker admitted mr @entity3 's stunt was in retaliation for her latest escapade , in which she filled his garden with model animals to make it resemble a mini safari park while he was away on holiday			1
mrs @entity6 filled her neighbour 's back garden with replica animals including a sabre - toothed tiger , monkeys , ducks , flamingos , a 10ft crocodile and a sabre - toothed tiger			2
she had even piped animal calls and music from @entity74 into @entity3 's garden			2
today mrs @entity6 admitted even she had been top - trumped			0
even the tree in mrs @entity6 's front garden was covered in foam , and her neighbours were in on the joke mr @entity3 's stunt was in retaliation for when he returned from holiday to find his garden had been turned into a zoo she said : ' @entity3 's been tormenting me with his pranks for years but i thought i 'd beaten him for good when i filled his garden full of animals			1
' but he got me good and proper with the foam - i 've never seen anything like it			0
' mrs @entity6 and her milkman husband @entity89 are close friends with mr @entity3 and his wife @entity91 in the village of @entity93 , near @entity94			1
mr @entity3 , who owns a cafe , said : ' @entity6 told me she was going away for the day so i knew my opportunity had come			2
residents in the north @entity99 village of @entity93 watched as mrs @entity6 returned home and then waded into the foam for a party @entity3 , right , says he is now dreading how his neighbour will retaliate after he went to great lengths to cover her garden in bubbles ' it was a bit of a @entity109 prank			1
' i hired a foam making machine and switched it on in her garden when she was due to return home			2
' i could n't believe how much foam it made - the garden was under 6ft of it			0
' the look on @entity6 's face when she came around the corner was priceless - she did n't know what the hell was going on			0
' @entity6 filled her neighbour 's garden with miniature animals and even played animal noises when he came home from holiday last summer write caption here now mr @entity3 is worried about how his neighbour will retaliate			1
he said : ' it was great fun but i 'm never going away on holiday again - i dread to think what @entity6 will do to me			0
' mrs @entity6 said : ' our feud is not over yet			0
i do n't like being beaten ! '			0
