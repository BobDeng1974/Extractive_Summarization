by @entity0 a dissolvable tampon could soon offer women faster protection against @entity5 , scientists say			1
those deemed to be at high risk of contracting @entity5 in the @entity8 are currently prescribed daily drugs , taken orally , to protect against the virus			1
but a range of new topical protection methods , including gels and films which can be inserted into the vagina before sex , are currently in development			1
a team of researchers at the @entity20 noted the new products were not performing well in clinical trials because they are difficult to use			1
scientists at the @entity20 have created a dissolvable drug , which could be spun and inserted into the vagina using an applicator , in a similar way to a tampon			1
they say the new discovery could help protect women from @entity5 faster and so they have created dissolving fibres , which could be spun and inserted into an applicator , similar to those used to insert tampons			1
bio-engineers believe the tampon could deliver a topical drug , known to protect women from contracting the virus , faster			0
their method spins the drug into silk - like fibres , which quickly dissolve when they come into contact with moisture			1
it means higher doses of the drug could be administered than is possible when using gels or creams			2
lead study author @entity50 , said : ' this could offer women a potentially more effective , discreet way to protect themselves from @entity5 infection by inserting the drug - loaded materials into the vagina before sex			1
' the findings build on previous research by the team , which found electrically spun cloth could be dissolved to release drugs			0
the latest study shows the fibre materials can hold 10 times the concentration of medicine as @entity68 gels currently in development			0
oral pills are available in the @entity8 for people who are considered at risk for hiv infection			0
meanwhile a host of topical medications in the form of gels and films are starting to be developed			2
they are placed inside the vagina before sexual intercourse , allowing the drug to dissolve and diffuse into the surrounding issue			2
the tampons are placed inside the vagina before sexual intercourse , allowing the drug to dissolve and diffuse into the surrounding issue people deemed at risk of contracting @entity5 , seen under the micropscope , are currently given daily drugs , in oral form , in the @entity8 called microbicides , the drugs must be given as a large dose to be effective minutes before sex			1
but to date the topical drugs have not performed well in clinical trials , partly because they were not easy to use			0
drugs in film form take at least 15 minutes to fully dissolve in the body , while the volume of gels must be large enough to deliver a full dose but small enough to prevent leaking			2
' the effectiveness of an @entity68 topical drug depends partially on high - enough dosages and quick release , ' @entity50 said			0
' we have achieved higher drug loading in our material such that you would nâ€™t need to insert a large amount of these fibres to deliver enough of the drug to be helpful			0
' the research team says the soft , dissolving fibres could be rolled into a cardboard tampon applicator for insertion or built into the shape of a vaginal ring , similar to those used for contraception			0
the material can accommodate different @entity68 drugs and the team is testing several others for effectiveness			0
assistant professor @entity129 , who led the research , said : ' we think the fibre platform technology has the capability of being developed into multifunctional medical fabrics that address simultaneously challenges related to biological efficacy and user preferences			0

scientists at the @entity20 have created dissolvable silk fibres which could be spun and inserted using an applicator
fibres carrying *anti-viral* drug dissolve when in contact with moisture
researchers say their discovery is easier to use than @entity5 gels and films
