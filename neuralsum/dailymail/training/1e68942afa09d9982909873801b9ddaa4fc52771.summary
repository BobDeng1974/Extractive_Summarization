by @entity0 a provocative @entity2 blog called women @entity3 is kicking up a predictable storm amongst women who do identify as feminists			1
the blog collects photos of women posing with hand - written signs that all begin : ' i do n't need feminism because ... ' - and are peppered with a variety of reasons , common themes including : ' i am not a victim , ' ' i 'm proud to be a stay - at - home mom , ' and ' i love chivalry			1
' largely , the response to this blog - especially to posts such as ' i do n't need feminism because i like when men say compliments about my body ! ' - has been less than favorable , with reactions ranging from mockery and disregard , to all - out horror			1
speaking out : women against @entity3 is a @entity2 blog which invites people to pose with their own reasons as to why they are anti-feminist , and has attracted both support and a backlash the campaign is reminiscent of the @entity41 , which invited women to share their reasons for being pro-feminist , although women @entity3 do n't claim their blog is a response to it			1
women against @entity3 has triggered countless angry responses , largely accusing submitters of having completely missed the concept of feminism , and branding them ' naive , ' ' selfish , ' and ' poorly educated			1
' posts such as these were especially criticized : ' i do n't need feminism because my self - worth is not directly tied to the size of my victim complex ! ' and : ' as a woman in the western world , i am not oppressed and neither are you ! ' as a point of reference , the dictionary definition of the term describes feminism as : ' the theory of the political , economic , and social equality of the sexes			2
' the anonymous founder of the blog feels , however , that many modern feminists do n't subscribe to this			2
' feminism is not what it claims to be , ' she writes			1
' anyone can recite a dictionary definition			0
but my rejection of feminism comes from more real - life reasons			1
' loving life : many of the submitters feel the war has already been won in terms of gender equality history : this woman is referring to @entity90 , the @entity91 social reformer who played a pivotal role in the women 's suffrage movement , which resulted in women 's right to vote in 1920 popular view : the feeling that feminism contradicts the traditions of a family is a commonly occurring thread for the women @entity3 stay - at - home mom : many women defended their husbands or other male family members from what they feel is unfair prejudice ' i do n't need feminism because i do n't need to grow out my body hair to prove i 'm equal to men , ' one submission reads			1
another vented : ' respecting my husband as the man in our marriage does not make me less of a woman ! i do n't need to demonize men			0
' ' how the f * * k am i supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband ? ' also found on women @entity3 are frequent posts from stay - at - home moms , such as : ' i do n't need feminism because i made my own choice to be a stay at home mother and my working husband should not be harassed			1
' then there were several mentions of rape , with one woman posting : ' i do n't need feminism because getting drunk at a party and having sex with a stranger is just irresponsibility , not rape ! ' and on a lighter note , one woman with the reasoning : ' how the f * * k am i supposed to open jars and lift heavy things without my husband ? ' loves cooking : this woman feels that feminists have a tendency to ' whine hysterically ' until people ' buy ' them stuff , and that children are considered punishment independent : the blog has triggered a storm of critics , largely women who do consider themselves feminists and feel the submitters ( such as this woman ) have got the concept of feminism wrong altogether no victim : plenty of submitters resent being considered ' weak ' just because they are women the blog prompted one feminist , writer @entity167 , to respond with a slew of satirical posts			1
' i do n't need feminism because i want boys to like me , ' reads one , while another states : ' i do n't need feminism because the only way i think i can get along in this world is by pandering to the status quo and sh * * * ing on other women			1
' ' i do n't need feminism because i 'm a teenager who has n't entered the workforce yet ' she also fed into the shared view of several others , that many of the women @entity3 submitters were simply too young to fully understand certain issues surrounding the concept			1
' i do n't need feminism because i 'm a teenager who has n't entered the workforce yet and i do n't know what constant sexual harassment or watching unqualified people get promoted over me feels like , ' ms @entity167 posted			2
true stories : this women says she was bullied by a female teacher for wanting to be a wife and mother , and feels feminism fuels such treatment body hair : while some submissions were rambling , others kept their views simple and to - the - point stigma : this woman says her brothers have been unfairly demonized all their lives for being male @entity213 , a feminist who has been working with women 's right initiatives in more than 80 countries for over 40 years , spoke to @entity217 about her view on the women against feminism blog			1
' if the women " do n't need " feminism because they have transcended gender discrimination ... they 've achieved a feminist utopia ' she said : ' if the women " do n't need " feminism because they have transcended gender discrimination and inequality , more power to them ... they 've achieved a feminist utopia			2
that 's good news ! ' the fact that they understand feminism in a way that is different from my daily reality and understanding is something that i can live with			2
' i hope they keep talking about feminism			0
it will guarantee that feminism will still be there when and if they are interested			0
' easy : this woman does n't need feminism , it appears , because it goes against chivalry not rape : it is not entirely clear why this woman chose to broadcast her message naked in response to the backlash they have faced , women @entity3 issued the following statement on its @entity262 page , which has amassed over 13,800 ' likes ' and counting : ' so feminists have been calling us lots of names lately			2
' basically they are saying , " you 're too stupid to know what you want			0
you need us to tell you what 's good for you			0
and if you try to get away , we will throw insults " ... are all feminists like this ? no. are a lot of them like this ? yes			0
just look at how the " feminist media " has treated us this week			0
' it may be a hot topic this week , but this is not a new debate			0
girls creator @entity283 has previously weighed in on the subject , saying : ' so many women have come to this idea of it being anti-male - but what feminism is about is equality and human rights			2
' opinions differ : @entity283 ( left ) wants to ditch the ' anti-male ' label from the feminist equation , @entity292 ( center ) thinks we still live in a ' patriarchal society ' and @entity299 ( right ) thinks feminism is ' boring ' actress @entity292 thinks the battle for gender equality is far from won , stating : ' i do n't know why people are so reluctant to say they 're feminists			0
could it be any more obvious that we still live in a patriarchal world when feminism is a bad word ? ' and as for songstress @entity299 , she 's over the whole thing altogether			0
' whenever people bring up feminism , i 'm like , god			0
i 'm just not really that interested , ' she said in a recent interview			0
' for me , the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept			0

the @entity2 blog invites women to pose with their own reasons for being anti-feminist
one claims that feminism ' demonizes traditional family constructs '
critics have labeled submitters as ' naive , ' ' selfish , ' and ' poorly educated '
