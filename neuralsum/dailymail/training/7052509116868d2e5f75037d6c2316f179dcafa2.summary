@entity0 has long been accused of a creative approach to geography when it comes to some of the @entity6 cities it claims to fly to			0
so it was inevitable that the budget airline would swiftly become the subject of mockery when a highly imaginative route map from its in - flight magazine @entity13 came to light			1
according to the map , @entity15 appears to have decamped 75 miles up the @entity17 to the fringes of the @entity19 , while @entity20 has also headed north and @entity22 is practically in @entity23			1
but matters are even stranger north of the border , where both @entity37 and @entity38 are located somewhere near @entity39			1
most bizarre of all is in the @entity42 airline ’s native country where @entity43 is provocatively placed slap - bang on the border with @entity46 - around 50 miles away from its actual location			0
the curious interpretation was spotted by passengers leafing through the @entity13 magazine handed out on @entity0 flights			0
it swiftly drew derision on @entity54 , with some wryly pointing out that it is not the first time the airline has been accused of sending passengers miles away from where they expected to be			2
@entity54 users jumped at the chance to poke fun at the budget airline for its creative approach to geography others questioned whether the map was actually the creative handiwork of an outside agency one @entity54 user , @entity70 , said : ‘ perhaps this explains why @entity0 flights always land a few hours away from your destination			1
’ @entity74 wrote : ‘ there ’s something so very appropriate over fact that @entity0 in - flight magazine ca n’t properly locate most airports			1
’ most infamously , @entity0 ’s flights to @entity81 actually land at the former @entity83 air force base @entity84 which is 75 miles or nearly an hour and a half ’s drive from the city itself – closer to @entity89 , in fact			2
the budget airline became infamous for flying to airports outside of the cities that it advertised they also came under fire in 2012 for launching a service to an airfield in the @entity99 of @entity100 billed as @entity103 - @entity102 - @entity101 when it is 70 miles from @entity103 and 90 miles from the @entity100 capital			2
@entity106 , founder of @entity107 , once described the carrier as flying from ' nowhere to nowhere '			0
responding to the cities blunder yesterday , a spokesman for @entity0 made light of the glitch , saying : ‘ we fly to so many airports ( 189 across @entity6 ) , we can barely fit them on the same page , never mind the same map			0
’ the airline insists it has moved on from its reputation for obscure destinations , saying it is flying to more ‘ primary ’ airports than ever with @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 among those added over the past 12 months .			0

in - flight magazine @entity13 appears to show @entity15 in @entity19
city has been moved 75 miles north up the @entity17
@entity37 and @entity38 located near @entity39 on same map
@entity54 users mock airline for its fame of flying to airports outside cities
