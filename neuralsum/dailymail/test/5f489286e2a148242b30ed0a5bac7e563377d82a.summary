he then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison			1
the victim continued to talk to @entity0 , who she felt sorry for , but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she did n't reply			1

in january last year @entity0 made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child			1

' on 24 march , shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison , three men entered the home of the woman 's aunt and uncle looking for a safe			0
' @entity0 's @entity17 status two days later , boasting that he sent his ' soldiers ' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary			0
@entity0 was serving time at @entity12 ( pictured ) when he began contacting the woman ' this is a highly unusual case which demonstrates @entity0 's ability to control , manipulate and harass young women			1
' @entity0 has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes , he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences			1
' it is clear that @entity0 , who operated four @entity17 accounts through five different phones from behind bars , thinks he is above the law and unfortunately , does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour			2
' the woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months			0
the stress caused by @entity0 's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes , while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life			2
' with this in mind , i would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by @entity0 , either online or over the phone , to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us			2
