ordinary homeowners will be end up being ‘ clobbered ’ by @entity3 ’s mansion tax , @entity0 claimed yesterday			1
the chancellor dismissed @entity5 claims that the annual levy would apply only to homes worth £ 2million or more , insisting it would end up being charged at far lower property valuations			1
@entity9 gave further details about who will be hit by the charge yesterday , saying it would be staggered so that the owners of the most valuable properties are hardest hit			1
this suggests that those in the most expensive houses will be hit with bills for tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds a year			0
earlier this month @entity29 , the @entity3 leader , was forced to defend the tax from a savage attack from the singer @entity32			1
she confronted him on a tv show , complaining that the levy would hit ‘ grannies ’ who had little income and pointing out that £ 2million would not pay for much in some parts of @entity40			2
war of words : mr @entity0 was faced with claims the money was needed to save the @entity45 mr @entity9 insisted that safeguards would be put in place to exempt asset rich , cash poor homeowners , such as low - income pensioners who bought homes that have increased dramatically in value			1
the proposed £ 2million threshold will be raised in line with high end property prices			2
the @entity57 have long been in favour of a similar form of mansion tax , and the policy is expected to be introduced quickly if there is a @entity63 after may ’s general election			0
mr @entity9 told the @entity66 ’s @entity20 programme yesterday : ‘ people with houses of £ 50million or £ 10million can afford to pay a bit more , and they are going to under the next @entity3 government			1
‘ the vast majority of properties in @entity40 and across the country will not pay			0
but do n’t you think it is fair , especially when so many foreign investors are investing in our housing market , and when you have much lower tax rates on highest value properties than other houses ? ‘ we need some money to save the @entity45 – that ’s what we are going to deliver			0
most people think it is fair , whatever @entity32 thinks			0
‘ we are going to graduate it , it is going to be a progressive tax ... over £ 3million , over £ 10million , over £ 50million it will more than proportionally increase			2
‘ it will be progressive so it is going to be steered , staged and tiered but it will be fair			0
‘ nobody watching your programme with a house worth less than £ 2million will pay			2
‘ most people think a tax on properties above £ 2million is fair to save the @entity45			0
’ the chancellor said : ‘ it ’s not a mansion tax			0
it ’s a tax on people ’s homes			0
and of course they come on this show and tell you it ’s for people with houses worth £ 10million or £ 50million			1
‘ once @entity3 introduce a homes tax , it will be people with homes worth a fraction of that who will be clobbered with it			1

@entity9 insists proposed tax would only hit homes worth £ 2m or more
@entity3 say it will be *strictly* banded for £ 2m , £ 3m , £ 10m and £ 50m homes
but @entity0 claims it would end up on homes ' worth a fraction of that '
