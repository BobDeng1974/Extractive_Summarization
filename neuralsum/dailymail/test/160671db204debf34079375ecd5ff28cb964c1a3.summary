@entity0 today brushed off @entity2 's class war attacks , mocking @entity3 on live television over the fact they both went to the same private school			1
challenged about claims senior @entity10 are ' posh boys ' , ms @entity3 , @entity2 's deputy leader , insisted they were only ' standing up for people at the top '			1
but sharing a breakfast tv sofa with her was mr @entity0 , who said that as they both went to @entity17 in @entity18 , ' the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin '			1
ms @entity3 went to @entity29 in the 1960s in the 1980s , mr @entity0 attended @entity17 for boys , where a place for a pupil boarding costs £ 10,800 - a - year			1
ms @entity3 , who went to @entity29 in the 1960s , has repeatedly accused the @entity10 of being ' completely out of touch '			2
she has previously faced the wrath of @entity2 backbenchers when she sent her son and daughter to selective grammar schools			2
appearing on @entity43 's @entity42 show , ms @entity3 complained about @entity10 attacks on @entity45 that he ' stabbed his brother in the back ' for the @entity2 leadership			1
host @entity42 asked : ' is that somehow worse than accusing @entity0 and @entity50 of being ' posh boys ' ? is there any difference really ? ' challenged about claims senior @entity10 are ' posh boys ' , ms @entity3 , @entity2 's deputy leader , insisted they were only ' standing up for people at the top '			1
ms @entity3 did not resile from the class - based attacks , and added : ' well i think we 're saying they 're standing up for people at the top and everybody else has been suffering and the recovery has n't reached people			1
' but that is quite different from saying that as prime minister @entity45 would stab this country in the back			0
' but sitting barely three feet away on the couch , mr @entity0 shot back : ' well @entity3 and i went to the same school , so the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin when coming from her			1
' but the point i 'd make is we 've got a really positive vision for this country and actually i 've found this campaign enormously energising and exciting			0
' and i go round the country - people are switched on , people do care about this country 's future			2
' ms @entity3 attacked the @entity10 over their commitment to spend an extra £ 8billion on the @entity85 , insisting it was ' absolutely illusory ' earlier ms @entity3 said conservative plans for ' extreme ' spending cuts would inevitably mean further cutbacks to health			0
' the reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the @entity85			0
' i do n't think that people will believe it anyway			0
people know that they find it harder to see their gp since the @entity10 came into government , they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow			2
' mr @entity0 insisted , however , that the @entity106 had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the @entity85			2
' we have a balanced plan to grow our economy , to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our @entity85 each and every year , ' he said			0
' we have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years			0
' we have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £ 8 billion extra in real terms for the @entity124 in very , very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle , we have proved our ability to stand behind the @entity124 in this parliament			0
we can do it in the next			0
