by @entity0 published : 09:56 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 11 september 2012 a @entity2 congressman is under investigation for using campaign funds to cover personal expenses for a luxurious vacation in @entity7 for his wife and two daughters			1
@entity12 rep. @entity11 ( @entity13 ) splashed out more than $ 30,000 to attend the wedding of an unnamed donor - an expense that was vetted by his wife who serves as a volunteer compliance officer for the politician			1
the @entity20 ruled in early september there is ' substantial reason to believe ' @entity11 inappropriately used campaign funds for the family trip and the @entity20 will extend their investigation to fully review the matter			1
all in the family : rep. @entity11 pictured in 2008 with his wife , @entity31 , ( right , in red ) , his daughter @entity28 ( right , in white sweater ) and daughter @entity28 ( far right ) in june 2011 , @entity11 shelled out $ 7,725 for two rooms at the @entity34 in @entity35 for a three night stay			1
additionally , his campaign covered $ 463 for a wedding gift from @entity39 's , $ 953 to cover incidentals like cabs rides , meals and tips and additional funds to pay for flowers and gifts			2
his leadership pac had also covered the family 's business class airfare across the pond , topping $ 16,575 , and an extra $ 1,800 to cover airline change fees			1
but after the embarrassing expenses were reported in the local press last year , @entity11 repaid $ 30,000 to his campaign			1
@entity54 digs : @entity11 spent $ 7,725 for a three night stay at the posh hotel in @entity35 @entity11 claimed the expenses were legitimate because the groom , who has not been identified for privacy concerns , was a donor			1
and though the donor did minimal volunteer work for the campaign and only donated $ 250 to the candidate , @entity11 said he planned the trip to ' deepen his ties ' to the friend of the campaign			2
but the federal panel disagreed			0
' the facts do not establish that @entity72 ’ relationship to witness 1 [ the unnamed donor ] was of a bona fide campaign of political nature that had a clear nexus to any political benefit , illustrating that the trip ’s purpose was for a family vacation to the wedding of a personal friend , ' the report , released on august 31 , said			2
the use of campaign money for the @entity11 family trip was approved by his wife , @entity31 , a lawyer and associate dean at the @entity90 law school , who is in charge of reviewing legal questions about her husband 's political spending			1
but critics point to the clear conflict of interest that his wife would have in sanctioning the swanky hotel stay and covering other questionable costs			0
' having your wife as the compliance officer is just asking for trouble , @entity103 , the policy director at the @entity104 in @entity105 , told the @entity110			1
@entity112 's little girl : @entity113 is an aspiring singer , who often accompanied her father to @entity115 as she pursued her entertainment endeavors			0
the 17 - year - old ( right ) is flanked by her supportive parents ' she has a vested interest in the resources and in the benefits that were provided by the campaign as the spouse			0
' but @entity11 is standing by the integrity of his wife in the matter , telling @entity126 she has ' followed both the letter and spirit of the law in all respects			2
' ' in a political world filled with complex political and legal issues , it is entirely appropriate for me to seek additional advice and guidance from a trusted and experienced lawyer who also is the person i am closest to in life , ' he said			0
after the @entity7 nuptials , the @entity11 clan stuck around @entity141 for a longer stay			0
' we 're convinced this is an appropriate expenditure to thank and support someone who has given us a lot of time and effort , ' @entity11 told the @entity149 about using campaign money for the @entity7 leg of their journey			1
' we would n't have gone on the @entity7 trip but for the fact that this person is an adviser and donor to us , ' he added			0
veteran politician : rep. @entity11 , 55 , has served in @entity160 for 21 years but the swanky accommodations for their @entity35 getaway are not the only expenses that have come under scrutiny			1
in june of last year , $ 10,000 from the congressman 's campaign fund was used to cover catering expenses for a party thrown as a joint celebration of @entity11 ' 20th year in @entity160 and his daughter 's high school graduation			1
the shindig , at the family home in @entity174 , @entity2 , was attended by 300 guests			0
two separate invitations were sent out			0
the first inviting donors and those connected to the congressman and a second version was sent to celebrate the graduation of his daughter , @entity182 , from the @entity184 - an exclusive girl 's prep school in @entity187			0
a member of @entity11 ' staff maintains that the majority of guests were connected to the campaign , saying only 10 per cent of those attending were connected to the high school grad			2
and expenses for the politician 's other daughter , @entity28 , have also been called into question			0
the girl is an aspiring actress and singer and she frequently accompanies her father to @entity115 , where he travels for fundraising events			0
these campaign events conveniently coincide with her acting auditions and recording sessions and according to the @entity208 account for the 17 - year - old , her home city is listed as @entity115			0
according to campaign filings , an investigation found that the congressman spent $ 97,000 on at least 18 trips to @entity214 from 2007 to 2011			2
' she has come with me on trips to @entity214 to do some of her business , but she ’s always part of my business as well , ' the father said about covering costs for @entity28 in @entity223			0
in addition to the @entity160 investigation into his spending , @entity11 faces a @entity228 complaint that has been filed by the @entity229 in @entity105			2
' while the inquiry undoubtedly will drag on for months , ' @entity230 , the executive director of the nonprofit watchdog , said , ' it 's hard to fathom a scenario in which rep. @entity11 walks away from this unscathed			1
