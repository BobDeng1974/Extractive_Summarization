by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 01:30 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 1 november 2013 just six people successfully enrolled in health insurance plans through healthcare.gov during the first day of the @entity7 system 's operation , according to @entity9 meeting notes released thursday night by a congressional committee			1
by the end of the second day , a total of 248 people nationwide had bought insurance policies through the federal government 's online portal , whose disastrous launch has become the stuff of late - night tv jokes and a @entity22 skit			1
the bombshell documents reflect summaries of ' war room ' meetings held at least twice a day during the system 's chaotic start by a technology working group inside the @entity31 , a @entity9 division tasked with putting the website 's plan into action			1
turned over by a private @entity7 contractor at the request of the @entity38 , not by the @entity40 administration , the four pages paint a picture of a multidisciplinary team trying to right a sinking ship , and collecting statistics as it takes on water			1
committee staff provided the documents to reporters on thursday evening while the @entity75 was in the middle of a trick - or - treating event for children of military families			1
the @entity40 administration has said publicly that 4.7 million unique website visitors came to healthcare.gov in its first 24 hours beginning at midnight on tuesday , october 1			1
but war room meeting notes from the following morning showed that ' six enrollments have occurred so far with 5 different [ insurance ] issuers			1
' the lucky few chose insurance policies with @entity89 @entity88 ; @entity89 @entity90 ; the @entity92 - headquartered @entity91 ; and @entity93 , a @entity95 - based company that sells @entity89 plans in @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , by the afternoon of oct. 2 , war room meeting notes reflected ' approximately 100 ' successful enrollments			1
that number grew , modestly , to a total of 248 by day 's end , according to notes from the morning meeting on oct. 3			2
@entity9 administrator @entity109 refused to provide hard numbers to the @entity111 on october 29 , saying only that ' we 'll have that information available until mid-november ' kiss of death : a website that was n't adequately tested , and was built for a relatively small traffic load , had no chance on day one , and the enrollment figures are proof @entity68 spokeswoman @entity119 told the @entity61 on thursday evening that the documents ' appear to be notes ' and do n't reflect official totals , which the agency has repeatedly said it plans to withhold until mid-november			1
' we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time			0
... we have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period , ' she said			0
hedging his bets ? on oct. 21 , @entity40 said ' the number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming ... [ and ] thousands of people are signing up ' the full open enrollment period for the @entity7 will last for six months , ending march 31			1
by then , the administration hopes 7 million @entity1 will enroll in medical insurance plans through healthcare.gov and the similar websites run by 14 states and the @entity144			0
at that rate , the government needs to find about 38,500 new paid enrollees every day , on average			1
some of the state - run programs have faced their own challenges			0
halfway through october , @entity153 's exchange reported signing up just one person , @entity151 had enrolled seven , and @entity156 's total was less than 50			2
by october 18 , @entity157 conceded that it had n't yet processed any applications for private insurance through its exchange			0
sources inside @entity68 told @entity162 in mid-october that 52,000 people nationwide had completed applications for coverage by the end of the first week of october			0
that number likely included consumers whose applications were n't processed immediately , but also a much larger number who elected to sign up for @entity173 coverage instead of enrolling in plans they will pay for themselves			0
those @entity173 enrollments will add only to the overall cost of the @entity7 – unlike private insurance policies , whose premiums will subsidize the expense of medical care provided to others in the system			2
pants on fire ? ' we do not have any reliable data around enrollment , ' insisted hhs secretary @entity190 on october 30 during a congressional hearing			0
' the system is n't functioning , so we 're not getting reliable data ' @entity38 chairman rep. @entity71 , an @entity194 partisan , released the documents on thursday night , which his committee got from a private contractor doing work on the @entity7 website @entity40 spoke to adoring throngs in @entity201 this week , including one fan whose ' i ( heart ) @entity7 ' cast he gladly signed numbers from the war room meetings include only the successful sign - ups completed through healthcare.gov , not through any of the state - based insurance exchanges			1
they also , according to an @entity68 spokesperson who talked to @entity212 , do not include applications from people who chose to fill out paper applications or register by telephone			0
but those other methods , along with assistance from ' navigator ' program helpers , also rely on the website			0
@entity225 center operators and navigators enter consumers ' information into the website in real - time , and a contractor enters handwritten information into the website days or weeks after ink hits paper			2
given the tech woes that plagued healthcare.gov early on – and continue to knock it offline on a regular basis – it 's unlikely anyone had significantly greater success			2
medical insurance industry consultant @entity243 told @entity61 that ' the @entity75 does not want insurance companies talking about what 's going on here			0
' ' if four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public , ' he said , ' it would look very bad			2
i can tell you based upon the information that i continue to get , this trickle of enrollment ... for the first three days has really continued for the first month			0

documents a government contractor gave to a congressional committee show tiny enrollment numbers in @entity7 's bleak early days
numbers come from notes taken during twice - daily ' war room ' meetings begun after the healthcare.gov website *sputtered* and crashed on oct. 1
president @entity40 said on oct. 21 that ' thousands ' – not tens or hundreds of thousands – were signing up
the @entity75 has lowered *expectations* by saying it expected a slow start
in order to stay *financially* above water , the @entity7 must *attract* 38,500 new paid enrollees every day from october through march
