by @entity0 and @entity1 firms fear if they cut prices ahead of the winter , a victory for @entity6 next may would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs energy giants are refusing to pass on lower wholesale gas prices to customers ahead of the @entity11 in response to @entity14 ’s threat to impose a price freeze			1
the firms fear that if they cut prices ahead of the winter , a victory for @entity6 next may would see them forced to stick with these new tariffs for at least 20 months			1
the net effect means that @entity14 ’s price promise freeze – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increases in the cost of living – has backfired spectacularly			1
the wholesale price of gas to be supplied next winter is down by around 20 per cent compared to the winter of 2013 - 14 , and this reduction , which could be worth £ 50 per household , would normally be passed on			0
wholesale electricity costs are down too – the two are inextricably linked because gas is used to fuel some power stations			0
however , one of the most senior executives at a ‘ big six ’ energy supplier told the @entity40 : ‘ we do n’t expect to see any reduction in tariffs this side of the @entity11			0
' if you have the prospect of a 20 - month price freeze should @entity14 win the general election , energy companies will not want to be locked in to a lower price			1
’ he added : ‘ to some extent , the decision on whether to pass on the lower wholesale price depends on the polls			0
if they point to a @entity14 win , then reductions in bills are unlikely			1
if @entity14 is falling behind , the industry may feel they are safe in making reductions			2
’ the result of the @entity14 price freeze promise and the industry ’s response is that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next winter			1
some @entity67 analysts had already warned that @entity14 ’s policy would backfire , however the admission from the energy industry insider is proof positive that this is the case			1
@entity72 mp , the former @entity73 cabinet minister and a member of the @entity75 , said : ‘ this was always a fear when @entity14 announced their proposal			1
' the concern was that companies would resist any downward pressure on prices ahead of an election			2
‘ it seems that prices are being held higher than necessary at the moment and if @entity14 were to win the election they would be frozen at this higher point for 20 months afterwards			1
' effectively , the shadow of a possible @entity14 government is having very serious negative consequences for consumers and the wider economy			2
’ energy analyst @entity95 , of @entity96 , previously warned that @entity14 ’s price freeze would lead to higher , not lower , prices			1
‘ this does n’t surprise me at all , ’ he told the @entity40 yesterday			0
‘ there should now be scope for price reductions , and if we were in a normal and non-political environment you would be very confident of material price reductions in the autumn			0
’ he said the net effect would be that energy companies would seek to buy large amounts of gas and power ahead of 2015/16 to protect them against the impact of a price freeze			0
as a result , he said : ‘ costs to consumers are very likely to be higher than they otherwise would be			0
’ the industry regulator @entity118 is alarmed that energy companies have failed to pass on the recent falls in wholesale costs to customers			0
it has referred the industry to an inquiry by the @entity126 , which will investigate allegations of profiteering			0
however , it has no power to force the firms to cut tariffs now			2
recent figures from @entity118 show the average annual profit margin the big six energy firms are making per customer has more than doubled in the past year to £ 101			2
@entity14 mp @entity137 has called for massive fines if any of the companies are found guilty of rigging the market and bills			2
he said : ‘ if they are found guilty , the tens of millions in fines should go straight back into the pockets of consumers who have been ripped off all these years			0

firms fear they will have to stick with cut prices in @entity14 wins
