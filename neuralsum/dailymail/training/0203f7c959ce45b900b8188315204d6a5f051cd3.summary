by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:14 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 3 april 2013 @entity2 is the flagship benefits reform of work and pensions secretary @entity3 benefit changes coming into force this year leave the door open for fraudsters to submit multiple claims on the same house , it as warned today			1
the taxpayers already loses £ 350million a year in housing benefit fraud and @entity13 today warned plans to combine a raft of handouts into a single payment will see even more public money claimed illegally			1
the revelation comes just weeks before ministers start rolling out their flagship @entity2 designed to dramatically overhaul @entity23 ’s complex welfare system			1
work and pensions secretary @entity3 has long argued that the single @entity2 will save money through reduced running costs while making sure that work always pays			1
but concerns have been growing about its implementation , with the @entity30 today warning that the vast new it system will have trouble distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent claims			2
pilots of @entity2 are due to start this month , and will be implemented nationally from october			2
it replaces a string of benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits			1
councils told the committee they have been raising concerns about fraud for up to three years , but the @entity45 has still not found a way to prevent a major source of fraud			2
the system will not work from local authority property databases so it will not be able to detect automatically , as local systems did now , when several people made a housing benefit claim for the same property			1
@entity55 warned that fraud is a ‘ major issue ’ in the proposed new system			2
‘ with the veriﬁcation of certain documentation no longer being required this also leaves the proposed new system open to fraud , ’ @entity59 added			1
@entity66 council warned a loss of local knowledge will ‘ probably lead to an increase in fraud ’			2
the committee also raised concerns that there will be an exodus of experienced local authority housing department staff , who will quit due to uncertainty over their future prospects , which ‘ will leave the system more open to fraud ’			1
chancellor @entity82 yesterday defended the government 's benefits changes , insisting they ensure work will always pay the committee said the government must make sure that local authorities have the admin funding they need to manage the transition to @entity2 and stop staff leaving prematurely			1
@entity2 is being introduced in gradual stages over several years , with the national rollout following several ‘ pathfinder ’ pilot projects taking place from this month			2
chancellor @entity82 yesterday defended the government 's ambitious reforms , insisting it will replace ' all those complicated benefits and tax credits with a single , simple @entity2 which ensures you ’re always better off working '			1
it will be trialled in the @entity105 later this month to ' make sure it ’s ready for national roll out later this year , ' he said in a speech at a @entity110 depot in @entity111 , @entity112			0
mr @entity82 added : ' be in no doubt : reforming the welfare system is a big job , and it ’s hard			0
but i ’m proud of what we ’re doing to restore some common sense and control on costs			0
' in recent days we have heard a lot of , frankly , ill - informed rubbish about these welfare reforms			0
some have said it ’s the end of the welfare state			0
that is shrill , headline - seeking nonsense			0
i will tell you what is true			0
taxpayers do n’t think the welfare state works properly anymore			0
' however , there are increasing concerns about whether the reforms will work in practice			0
@entity139 mp @entity138 , chairman of the committee , said it was ‘ extremely concerning ’ that systems to detect fraud were still being developed			0
he said : ‘ the government must act to provide assurance that the benefit system will not be left vulnerable to fraud either during or after the transition			1
and it must do so urgently			0
’ the committee said the landmark changes mark the ‘ most significant reforms to the welfare system for 60 years ’			0
the government wants to simplify the existing benefits system , so that it is easier for claimants to manage their own finances and make the transition into work			2
councils warn that the new computer system will not be able to automatically identify if several people are claiming housing benefit on the same house or flat under @entity2 , a single unified benefit payment will take in income - based jobseeker 's allowance , income - related employment and support allowance , income support , child tax credits , working tax credits and housing benefit			1
but the committee also highlighted concerns that the new @entity2 scheme could result in increased rent arrears as housing support will be paid directly to tenants instead of landlords			1
it urged the government to give a clear definition of the circumstances under which a tenant would be considered ‘ vulnerable ’ , and would therefore have their rent paid directly to the landlord			0
the committee also said that the government should be doing more to raise awareness about the changes and advising claimants to contact their local authority to find out more through advertising			0
a @entity45 ( @entity45 ) spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 will cut benefit fraud by £ 200 million a year and we are confident that our it systems will be strong enough to protect us from the threat of fraud			1
‘ we have been running pilot projects with local authorities to ensure that those people who ca n't manage with monthly or direct payments get the support they need			0

raft of benefits to be combined into a single @entity2
but *mps* and councils warn new it system is open to fraud
housing benefit checks will not automatically be made to spot repeated claims on the same house
