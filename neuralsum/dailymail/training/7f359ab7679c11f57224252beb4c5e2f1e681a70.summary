former contestants of @entity2 's @entity1 have revealed that much of the show was faked			0
according to the @entity9 , many of the flashy upgrades installed by rapper @entity6 and his @entity8 crew did n't work , made the car worse or were simply taken out as soon as the cameras stopped rolling			1
the show , was enormously popular when it debuted in 2004 , featured participants who had clapped out cars , which would then be repaired and ' pimped out ' with new paint jobs , interiors and rims			1
the show also earned a reputation for its extravagant auto features such as adding pool tables , arcade machines , shoe racks , clothes dryers and chandeliers to cars			1
former contestants of the show have now revealed that many of the flashy upgrades to their cars were faked the before shot : the van ( pictured above ) before it received its ' pimp my ride ' treatment by the @entity2 show the rear of the minivan , before and after it has had its drastic makeover			1
however contestants of the @entity2 show have said on @entity43 that the many of the flashy features were unusable however a number of former contestants revealed in separate @entity48 's that many of the customizations were only put in for the sake of the show			1
' they actually take out a lot of the stuff that they showed on tv , ' said @entity57 , whose @entity58 was given ' pop - up champagne contraption ' and a ' drive in theater ' - both of which were taken out when the episode wrapped			0
he added the former was removed because they did n't want to be seen condoning drink driving ; the latter because it simply was n't road safe			2
the show , which debuted in 2004 , typically consisted of drivers with horribly beat up cars begging the team to ' pimp their ride ' the car was then taken to an auto body shop and given an extreme makeover with new paint jobs , interiors and rims the interior of this beaten up , junk - filled suv was refitted with red leather and tv screens in the headrests the show also earned a reputation for its extravagant features such as adding pool tables , arcade machines , shoe racks , clothes dryers and chandeliers to cars			1

another addition , a cotton candy machine , did n't have room for a lid , so if used the candy floss would just fly all over the place			0
not what it seems : former contestants on @entity2 's @entity1 , hosted in the @entity115 by rapper @entity6 ( pictured ) have claimed much of the show was faked ' they took the gull - wing doors off because the pistons used to lift them kept them from putting seat belts in the back , which was highly dangerous , ' he said			1
@entity101 also claimed the producers just wanted to put the cotton candy machine into someone 's car , and selected him because he was fat , even pouring bags of candy into his pre-pimped car			2
' i know i 'm fat , but they went the extra mile to make me look extra fat by telling the world that i kept candy all over my seat and floor just in case i got hungry			0
' then gave me a cotton candy machine in my trunk , ' he said			0
' i sat there and watched them dump out two bags of generic candy			0
i did not have any candy all over my car			0
that was completely fabricated for the story			0
' @entity101 also claimed he had to rent a car at his own expense while he waited months on the revamp ; not the couple of days the shows editors had viewers believe			2
the contestants also revealed that much of the reaction shots - when their new pimped ride is revealed - were faked and re-shot many times			0
a third contestant , @entity160 , clearly was n't excited enough when he had his @entity162 century returned			2
he said : ' i remember this very clearly , @entity164 , very big dude , he like puts his arm around my shoulder , kind of walks me around the shop for like 10 minutes and he 's like , " listen , we put a lot of work into this ... we expect you to be a little more f * * * * * * enthusiastic			0
" ' pimped : @entity8 used to add some outrageous features to the cars such as chandeliers and pool tables , but new claims say the vehicles were n't always road worthy afterward			1
