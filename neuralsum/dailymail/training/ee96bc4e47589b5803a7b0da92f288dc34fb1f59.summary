by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 expects more signings at @entity4 this summer and is backing @entity5 to win a permanent stay after arriving on a season - long loan from @entity8			1
the @entity9 made his debut for the @entity11 in sunday 's impressive 3 - 1 victory over @entity13 in @entity14			1
there is a deal in place to sign @entity5 for around £ 6million at the end of the season and @entity2 believes the 23 - year - old – who top scored in his homeland with 17 goals for @entity23 in 2013 - will prove a hit in the @entity25			2
' we believe he will show the form from @entity9 in the @entity25 with us			0
' ( @entity38 ) @entity37 is well aware of him and he had a big influence in @entity9			0
he went to @entity40 but did n't get many chances , he 'll get more chances with us			0
' @entity2 , though , has not ruled out another entry into the transfer market and @entity47 's @entity46 could emerge as a target			1
big impression : young winger @entity50 , who scored one goal and made another , celebrates in @entity14 the 21 - year - old was given an ultimatum by boss @entity56 last week to sign a new contract or face being sold			1
however , @entity58 can reveal that no deal has been put in front of @entity46 and @entity61 are aware of the situation			1
and @entity2 added : ' we 've always maintained that we will watch the window until the last hours			2
' we 've done some terrific business and i think it must be exciting for @entity4 fans that we 've got some terrific , offensive players			2
' i feel much more comfortable with the team and we can play a brand of football which is expected of us			0
' i think we could really trouble teams this season , which is something we did n't do in the second half of last season			0
' wait and see : no new deal has been put in front of @entity47 striker @entity46 , alerting @entity4 the victory over @entity13 included goals from @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity84 international @entity83			1
but it was 18 - year - old @entity82 – a @entity86 winger who also qualifies for @entity87 – who stole the show			0
' the real highlight of pre-season has been @entity82 and he was terrific again , ' @entity2 said			2
' it 's nice to see a young player really pushing and i thought he caused real problems for @entity13 – long may that continue			0

@entity2 *confident* @entity98 will stay permanently
@entity4 boss wants more signings before the transfer window closes
@entity58 understands @entity46 has had no contract offer from @entity47 , and has emerged as a @entity4 target
@entity4 beat @entity13 3 - 1 in @entity14 on sunday
