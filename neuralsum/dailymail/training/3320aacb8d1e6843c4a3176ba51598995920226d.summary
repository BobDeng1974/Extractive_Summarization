by @entity0 published : 20:48 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 01:59 est , 13 august 2013 @entity1 said it was wrong to ditch controls on @entity5 and other workers in 2004 @entity6 made a humiliating climbdown over immigration last night after its spokesman finally admitted opening the floodgates to @entity12 migrants was a mistake			1
@entity1 said it was wrong to ditch controls on @entity5 and other workers in 2004 – and claimed far more came to @entity15 ‘ than anybody had anticipated ’			1
the admission came in a speech dismissed as a ‘ car crash ’ before it was even made as mr @entity1 launched a u-turn on planned attacks on @entity22 and @entity23 over their use of foreign workers			1
critics pointed out the stark contrast with comments he made a year before the 2004 influx , when he called dire warnings about unrestricted migration ‘ huff and puff ’			2
in a further blunder , he accused @entity15 workers of being ‘ physically less mobile ’ than other @entity40 nationals in their search for jobs			2
it adds up to a disaster for @entity6 on an issue likely to be critical at the next election , in a summer in which it is widely seen as having lost ground to the government			0
@entity52 mps condemned mr @entity1 ’s ‘ short - sighted intervention ’ , calling him ‘ badly confused ’			1
@entity52 mp @entity55 , a member of the @entity56 , said : ‘ this is breathtaking hypocrisy , because of @entity6 ’s multiple failures in failing to impose transitional controls and the huge increase in the number of work permits made available to workers from outside the @entity40			1
‘ @entity6 has n’t got a leg to stand on			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s embarrassing retreat followed a clumsy briefing to a sunday newspaper , which reported he would attack @entity23 and @entity22 for ‘ seeming to deliberately exclude @entity15 people ’ from jobs and hiring foreign workers at lower wages			1
in an attack on ‘ unscrupulous employers whose only interest seems to be finding labour as cheaply as possible ’ he would accuse the supermarket of drafting in cheap foreign staff when it moved distribution centres , and claim @entity22 hired @entity5 people to avoid agency workers ’ regulations , it said			0
after a briefing to a sunday newspaper , it reported @entity1 would attack @entity23 and @entity22 for ' seeming to deliberately exclude @entity15 people ' from jobs but key passages were cut from the speech after a furious response from the two @entity15 firms , prompting @entity52 vice chairman @entity93 to accuse mr @entity1 of ‘ so much backtracking you needed five reverse gears ’			2
by yesterday morning , when he appeared on the @entity97 ’s today programme , mr @entity1 was reduced to saying : ‘ i fully accept that @entity22 and @entity23 often go the extra mile to try and recruit local workers			1
’ he made clear he did not consider them ‘ unscrupulous ’ – and it was pointed out that a @entity23 distribution centre he mentioned ‘ in @entity103 ’ was in @entity104 , @entity105			0
he said he accepted that ‘ @entity6 made mistakes when we were in government on migration ’ , adding : ‘ when the new @entity111 countries joined the @entity40 in 2004 it was right they should join the @entity40			0
but @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 sensibly said they would have transitional controls for seven years			0
we did n’t do that			0
a larger number of people came to the @entity15 than anybody had anticipated			0
’ however , in june 2003 , as commentators warned of the risks of opening @entity15 ’s borders without transitional controls on labour movement , mr @entity1 said in the @entity128 newspapers were guilty of ‘ huff and puff ’			1
last night @entity131 , @entity52 mp for @entity132 , said : ‘ @entity1 now calls transitional controls sensible , but does n’t apologise for failing to introduce them after levels of migration to the @entity15 exceeded @entity113 and @entity115			1
‘ @entity6 let immigration get out of control , and @entity1 ’s short sighted intervention today will do nothing to change this			2
’ immigration minister @entity140 said : ‘ @entity6 have opposed every one of the government ’s policies to bring immigration under control and refuse to say whether they will support our immigration bill			0
‘ this badly confused speech shows that @entity6 have n’t changed			0

@entity1 says it was wrong to ditch controls on migrant workers in 2004
