president @entity0 faced a tough crowd on tuesday – @entity3 military veterans – and fell flat on his applause lines as he failed to win over the @entity6 's convention - goers			1
his 35 - minute speech seemed to have reminded the audience of the stark divide between the @entity11 's policy choices and the feelings of the men and women often called on to carry them out			2
a @entity16 legionnaire who served in the @entity17 told @entity18 that ' a small group of @entity0 's admirers – and there are some here – sat near the front and tried to generate applause for him about 10 times			1
' ' they did n't get much pickup , ' the retired lieutenant colonel said of the ' instigators ' gathered at the @entity30 , @entity32 event , but ' they were persistent			0
you could tell when the applause was genuine and when it was n't			2
it was obvious to everyone here			0
' most of the veterans sat on their hands , leaving awkward silences where @entity11 speechwriters expected ovations			1
' that year , the president sent a 3 - minute video message instead of coming to @entity71			2
@entity72 , his @entity73 rival , flew 1,000 miles to speak in person			0
the veteran asked @entity18 to conceal his identity			0
' i do n't need that kind of trouble , ' he said			0
' i work for a government contractor			0
' after the customary introductions and thank - yous to dignitaries , @entity0 spoke for nearly eight full minutes on tuesday without a single clap			1
he touted his foreign policy bona fides , boasting that ' even countries that criticize us – when the chips are down and they need help , they know who to call			0
that 's what @entity3 leadership looks like			0
' sustaining our leadership , keeping @entity3 strong and secure , means we have to use our power wisely , ' @entity0 cautioned , in keeping with his slow approach to battling @entity100 and other terror groups overseas			1
' history teaches us of the dangers of overreaching and spreading ourselves too thin , and trying to go it alone without international support , or rushing into military adventures without thinking through the consequences			2
' you know that we should never send @entity3 's sons and daughters into harm 's way unless it is absolutely necessary and we have a plan and we are resourcing it and prepared to see it through			0
' tepid clapping followed pregnant seconds of emptiness			1
' we removed more than 140,000 troops from @entity120 and welcomed those troops home			1
it was the right thing to do			0
@entity0 could n't muster sustained applause for a declaration that ' in just four months we will complete our combat mission in @entity128 and @entity3 's longest war will come to a responsible end			1
' not even when he paused to honor ' every @entity3 who served to make this progress possible , every single one , especially the more than 2,200 @entity3 patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice in @entity128 to keep us safe			2
' the @entity11 is touting a package of 19 ' executive actions ' designed to improve the lot of servicemen and women after they return to civilian life			1
many are symbolic or represent minor changes			0
a few indicate significant moves in the direction veterans groups have demanded for decades : after he pledged to ' partner with @entity128 so their country can never again be used to launch attacks against the @entity3 , ' four seconds elapsed before a weak round of clapping could be heard in the hall			1
@entity0 did hit his stride , eventually			1
a louder but brief ovation rang out after he laid down an ultimatum to @entity100 , the @entity157			1
' our message to anyone who harms our people is simple , ' he said , calling to mind last week 's beheading video of @entity3 photojournalist @entity163			0
' @entity3 does not forget			0
we have proved time and time again we will do what 's necessary to capture those who harm @entity3 – to go after those who harm @entity3			0
' but the legionnaires held back their heartfelt acclaim for a full 17 minutes until the president mentioned the cure for what ails them			2
@entity0 's first and only truly robust applause line came with a pledge to reform the @entity178 , which has come under fire for months - long medical wait times and a scheme that buried appointments in order to artificially inflate success numbers			1
' the misconduct we 've seen of too many facilities , with long wait times and veterans denied care , and folks cooking the books , is outrageous and inexcusable , ' @entity0 said , waking up the crowd 's enthusiasm			1
' we 're focused on this at the highest levels			0
we are going to get to the bottom of these problems , we are going to fix what is wrong			0
' ' we are going to do right by you and we are going to do right by your families , ' he said , earning his only spontaneous hoots and shouts			0
' and that is a solemn pledge of commitment that i 'm making to you here			0
' the @entity178 , he said , has been given ' the authority to more quickly remove senior executives who do n't meet our high standards			1
if you engage in unethical practices or cover up a serious problem , you should be and will be fired			0
' rep. @entity218 , the @entity73 ' top dog on the @entity220 , told the @entity221 after @entity0 spoke that despite the president 's rhetoric , the @entity11 has stymied @entity224 in its attempts to clean up the @entity178			1
' no one has been fired as a result of the @entity178 scandal , ' @entity218 said			2
' the department is still sitting on 113 outstanding information requests from the @entity220 , and @entity178 whistle - blowers who tried to expose problems are still enduring retaliation			2
' not impressed : @entity3 legionnaires only rose to their feet to praise fellow veterans and hoot about firing @entity178 miscreants , whiel they sat on their hands for @entity0 's applause lines about his military strategy is this thing on ? @entity0 spoke for nearly 8 minutes without a single applause line , despite pausing several times in hope of an ovation nuclear : @entity248 sen. @entity247 ( @entity249 ) is in the fight of her life in @entity32 , and greeted @entity0 at the airport but did n't appear on stage with him daggers : @entity73 @entity3 senator @entity255 is no fan of @entity0 and hopes his flagging numbers drag down @entity247 to provide his state with a @entity73 replacement @entity0 's speech described a set of 19 ' executive actions ' – mostly small policy shifts , but including a few major tacks – designed to quell criticism of how his administration has cared for veterans since january 2009			1
they include expanded suicide prevention programs , new research funding for science that could change treatments for @entity272 , and a mandate that the @entity274 and @entity178 provide a seamless transition for servicemen and women who receive mental health treatment and medications			1
the @entity73 took shots at the president on tuesday for allowing problems to fester on his watch			2
the @entity73 also aimed at @entity32 sen. @entity247 , who is in a tough battle to keep her seat this november			0
' it 's been six years and president @entity0 and senator @entity247 have failed to deliver on the promises they 've made to our veterans , ' said @entity294 spokesman @entity293			1
' on their watch the systemic problems at the @entity178 have only gotten worse , despite lofty campaign promises to fix the problem			2
but instead of delivering results for our veterans , @entity247 has delivered for president @entity0 96 percent of the time while failing to get a single bill she ’s authored passed into law			1
' @entity247 addressed the legionnaires separately from @entity0			2
the two joked and hugged after the president deplaned from @entity307 , but did not appear on stage together .			0

president fell flat as audience of thousands responded to military pledges with anemic ovations
some applause lines met with awkward silence while others earned only three seconds of feeble clapping
crowd came to life to honor fellow veterans , not @entity0
president *announced* 19 ' executive actions ' aimed at restoring faith in failed @entity178 system and providing better health care outcomes to war veterans
@entity0 *flopped* with messages defending his cautious approach to battling @entity100 in @entity120 and @entity333
