for most people , the incredibly realistic graphics are the key to enjoying video games			1
however , one dedicated player has become a gaming whizz - despite being blind			2
@entity6 , a 19 - year - old from @entity7 in @entity8 , was born four months early , and as a result , was left blind from birth			1
incredible : @entity6 has spent hours teaching himself the precise combinations for @entity14 games where most computer games represent ‘ down time ’ or a means of relaxation , for @entity6 , mastering a game requires intense concentration - combining muscle memory with incredibly precise timing to make up for a lack of visual cues			1
' in @entity14 ( where the player has to press sequences of coloured keys to music ) i would sit for around 2 hours at a time , meticulously working on the muscle memory required to play the complex patterns , ' he said			1
' eventually , i was able to play some of the hardest songs in the game , including @entity36 's @entity35			0
despite this , he achieved strong gcses from @entity39 and an international baccalaureate degree			0
however , he says it was his introduction to video games that really changed his life			1
' at first , i simply enjoyed the sounds of music , and when i discovered i could actually play certain games a few years later , it was amazing , ' he said			2
' i went for a computer taster day at the @entity49 , but whilst others were playing games like @entity52 , i was introduced to a great title called @entity54			0
' this was a simple sound - oriented 4 - key adventure game aimed specifically at blind gamers , but for the time , it was revolutionary			1
' i was so hooked by this @entity59 epic that i bought it the next day			0
' i began to learn how to use a computer with screen - reading software and from then on i was able to download all the demos i wanted and buy my own games			0
i turned to the @entity65 and tried tennis and realized that if my timing was within a certain window , i could return the ball without any major difficulty			0
' where most computer games represent ‘ down time ’ or a means of relaxation , for @entity6 , mastering a game requires intense concentration - combining muscle memory with incredibly - precise timing to make up for a lack of visual cues			1
' in @entity14 ( where the player has to press sequences of coloured keys to music ) i would sit for around 2 hours at a time , meticulously working on the muscle memory required to play the complex patterns			1
eventually , i was able to play some of the hardest songs in the game , including @entity36 's @entity35			0
' as for my favourite game , it would probably have to be @entity92 for @entity93 , and for next - generation consoles , it would probably be @entity14			1
’ although there remains but a handful of games dedicated to the blind or visually impaired player , @entity6 has not let his condition stop him from enjoying the fruits of the mainstream , and even completing some of the most technically challenging titles around - using his disability to his advantage - especially in the beat - em - up genre			1
challenging : renowned as a difficult game on the hardest settings , @entity14 relies the player to press keys on an ' instrument controller ' that correspondent to the visual cues			1
@entity6 can play the game and complete the levels without needing to see these cues			2
‘ i have completed a few story modes , @entity118 and @entity92 9 's to name two			2
i can also beat my friends consistently at @entity14 , since i ’m not distracted by the flashy graphics ! ’ he jokes			1
' i play games with sound alone , which is a lot of fun to show sighted people			2
i do n't let my condition stop me playing a game , and if i have to get sighted friends help to play a 3d game like @entity130 ( a first - person shooter ) , then i will , as i love not only playing competitively , but also blowing things up ! ' i urge any gamers who are blind or visually impaired to look into all the equipment options available and see what ’s right for them , in terms of situation , price tag and usability			1
' i think that blind gamers should try , particularly with music based games , with the normal peripherals and then if they want or need adaptations , alternatives should be available			1
’ happy : gaming has given @entity6 a new aspect to his life , and he vows to keep searching for games that blind people can play and enjoy			1
unfortunately , inspirational figures are few and far between in the blind gaming community , but @entity6 points to a couple gamers who gave him the belief that the world of video games was n't just for sighted to enjoy			1
' the blind gamer who inspires me the most is probably a friend of mine by the name of @entity163 , as he has studied games in so much depth that he knows the mechanics better than most			2
as for the greatest blind gaming achievement that i am aware of ... well ... that ’s difficult			0
' a blind gamer who i have had the fortune to meet in person , by the name of @entity174 , has managed to play @entity175 and survive for a lengthy period of time			0
' additionally though , i do know that @entity178 , an @entity180 gamer , with no sighted help , has completed the @entity182 ... all 300 missions			0
’ but for @entity6 , the industry needs to do more to support the visually impaired community			1
he believes the same energy they put into graphical prowess should be put into the development of games taht are accessible and enjoyable for both blind and sighted gamers alike			1
@entity92 , @entity6 's favourite game			1
he says he can beat many of his sighted friends simply by recognising the sounds characters and moves in the game produce muscle memory is a type of memory that is ' taught ' through repetition - such as riding a bicycle , typing and playing a musical instrument			1
when a movement is repeated over time , a long - term muscle memory is created for that task , eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort			1
this process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems			0
' the gaming industry needs to support more visually impaired gamers , definitely			0
we are n't getting much help from other communities as well - certain gaming sites just do n't seem to appreciate that blind people can play games			2
' also , the developers are n't making things like high - contrast colours a priority			0
' a universal way for developers to help us is possibly have an accessibility mode implemented , whereby things like locking tones in shooters , or stereo panning in racing games to show where your car is are added			0
' however , these would be designed to make the game no easier than it is for anyone else			0
also , spoken tutorials would be extremely useful for sighted and blind players alike , since if executed correctly they are invaluable in improving strategy , ability or general understanding			2
’ there is , however , one piece of hardware that @entity6 would like to see created in the coming years			2
‘ it is simply a glove , or rather a pair , ' he explains			0
‘ when the gloves are recognised by the @entity255 , if the players ' hand is over an option , a small sensor in the palm will vibrate to tell them so			0
' then the option would be spoken by a synthesizer built into the firmware of the @entity255			0
' this technology could then be adapted into light guns			0
' it would be great as a tool for navigating without the controller			0
' at the moment , the thought of such a device is nothing more than a dream			0
but given how far technology has advanced , it is only a matter of time before developers listen to the blind community and make this a reality			2
for now at least , the wait gives @entity6 all the more time to practice			2
and to continue beating his sighted friends at their own game			1

@entity6 , 19 , uses ' muscle memory ' to *conquer* tough games
