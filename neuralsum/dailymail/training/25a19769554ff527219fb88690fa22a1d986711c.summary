by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 17:09 est , 23 september 2013 a judge hit out yesterday after discovering that a woman who falsely claimed £ 94,000 in benefits will clear the debt by using her welfare payments			2
‘ the taxpayer just ends up paying itself back , ’ stormed @entity6 after being told @entity7 would draw on her £ 237 - a - week handouts			1
the judge jailed 37 - year - old @entity7 for 22 weeks , saying the money was not going to be repaid in any meaningful way			1
anger : @entity7 , left , falsely claimed £ 43,000 in benefits - but as judge @entity6 , right , pointed out , she will receive @entity17 funds to help her pay back her debt the mother of seven had pocketed extra benefits by claiming she lived alone			1
but undercover investigators spotted her handyman partner @entity22 taking their children to school and returning to the home they shared			1
between 2008 and 2012 , @entity7 illegally obtained £ 94,064 in income support , housing benefit and council tax benefit			2
had she told the truth about her partner she would instead have been paid £ 50,955 in tax credits			2
this means she needs to return around £ 43,000			0
when her lawyer @entity33 said his client ‘ knows she is going to have to pay the money back ’ , judge @entity6 interrupted to say : ‘ but she is n’t – the taxpayer is going to have to pay it back ! trapped by surveillance : @entity7 , 37 , did not tell officials that her boyfriend was living with her when she claimed benefits ‘ she has defrauded all this money but is entitled , from the state , to more money ! so the state will receive the money , from the money the state is giving her ! ’ @entity7 started making legitimate claims in 2001 , but failed to inform the benefits system when she moved in with mr @entity22 , who is father of six of her seven children			1
@entity56 , prosecuting , said : ‘ @entity58 surveillance showed mr @entity22 taking the children to school , returning with the shopping – effectively living as man and wife			1
’ mr @entity33 told @entity64 that jailing @entity7 , from @entity65 , @entity66 , would stop her partner working			1
‘ he would have to look after the seven children and would have to give up his employment and be in receipt of benefits , ’ said the barrister			1
sentence : the fraudster was handed a 22 - week prison sentence at @entity64 , pictured @entity7 broke down in tears in the dock as judge @entity6 rejected this argument , telling her : ‘ over a period of four years you obtained over £ 94,000 of taxpayers ’ money you were not entitled to			1
‘ you were not driven by debt or financial need but greed			2
‘ you took away that which should be given to people who are genuinely in need			2
‘ these frauds are becoming a very real and common problem			2
‘ it is realistically not going to be paid back – and if it is it will come back from the taxpayer as you are getting benefits still			1
’ @entity7 admitted three counts of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances			1
after the hearing @entity99 , deputy leader of @entity100 , said : ‘ we actively pursue people for benefit fraud and we want to give the message that you are not going to get away with it			0
' we are very good at pursuing information about benefit fraud , which we get from various sources including members of the public			0
’ lord @entity112 , who is the minister for welfare reform , said : ‘ we are taking on benefit fraud , with greater resources going to our investigation teams to stop those people who try to pocket support meant for the most vulnerable			2
‘ we have also ramped up our use of powers to claw back money from these cynical criminals			2
’ in 2011 , judge @entity6 hit out at rules that stopped her jailing salesman @entity125 for falsely claiming £ 12,000 in benefits , saying of the resulting suspended sentence : ‘ some may think it ’s pathetic , and that includes me			1
’ in 2008 she refused to spare a @entity132 illegal immigrant ’s bogus bride from a jail term even though she was having a baby			0

@entity154 , @entity153 , @entity155 , 10 hours ago i am now thinking that fraud is worth it - why should i work for what i have if all you get is 22 weeks for stealing nearly a £ 100,000 then getting the taxpayer to cough up the money to pay for her theft - shameful @entity164 , malaga , 11 hours ago 94000 quid for 22 weeks @entity165 at the taxpayers expense			1
it 's not right ! @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , 12 hours ago new rule that needs to be passed : anyone found guilty of cheating the benefits system , automatically loses eligibility to ever pocket benefits again			0
@entity176 , @entity177 , 13 hours ago £ 94,000 tax free in exchange forr 22 weeks in jail doing nothing ? sounds a great way of building your wealth			1

she should be refused any benefit until it 's been paid back , with the above costs , from hard work ! happy dude , @entity214 , @entity215 , 15 hours ago people in @entity215 who commit welfare fraud are jailed and made to repay the outstanding amount when they are released			0
