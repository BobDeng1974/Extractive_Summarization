by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 08:55 est , 12 july 2012 subscribers to @entity2 will lose @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and 14 other @entity7 channels after the two companies failed to reach a new contract after wrangling over the cost of programming			1
they had been in talks over a new contract - the previous one had been in place for the last seven years - but could not agree on terms before the tuesday midnight contract deadline			0
both @entity2 chief executive @entity18 and @entity7 ceo @entity19 addressed the standoff with reporters at @entity25 's media and technology conference in @entity26 , @entity27 , yesterday			1
@entity28 : cast who star on the hit @entity4 reality show - the channel is just one of more than a dozen which has been pulled they offered vastly different views of why negotiations broke down			2
' in the last seven years since we did the last @entity2 deal , we have successfully and peacefully concluded affiliate agreements with every major distributor in the @entity44 we are prepared to move forward			2
it 's unfortunate consumers for the first time are not able to enjoy our channels , ' said @entity19 , adding , ' i do n't want to negotiate in public			2
' @entity18 , too , expressed sympathy for @entity2 's 20 million subscribers , but he laid the blame for the blackout at @entity7 's feet			1
' all we are trying to get is a fair deal for our customers and i 'm sorry our customers are being forced into the middle of this , ' @entity18 said			0
pulled : @entity62 will also no longer be on the list of shows subscribers can receive ' we just think we pay a half a billion dollars a year and a billion dollar increase over five years , over 30 percent , is not justified by the marketplace or fair relative to our largest competitors or by their ratings			1
' @entity18 added that he spoke with @entity19 at the conference on wednesday			0
for its part , @entity7 has said that its stable of networks account for about 20 percent of all viewing on @entity2 but currently less than 5 percent of its programming costs			1
the dispute sent shares of both companies lower on wednesday			0
@entity2 shares ended down 1.1 percent , or 54 cents , at $ 48.15			2
@entity7 's stock fell 0.3 percent , or 13 cents , to $ 46.73			2
a complete list of channels no longer available on @entity2			1
@entity3 ( hd ) @entity5 ( hd ) @entity4 ( hd ) @entity86 ( hd ) @entity87 ( hd ) @entity89 ( hd ) @entity90 ( hd ) @entity94 @entity93 @entity92 the standoff is the latest between media companies and cable and satellite tv providers over the cost of content			0
these providers pay a fee to media companies that allows them to carry channels such as @entity4			0
on july 1 , @entity105 , the company behind shows such as " @entity107 , " " @entity108 " and " @entity109 , " was removed from the @entity110 after the two companies failed to reach a new contract			0
similar blackouts have taken place in recent years between @entity115 and @entity117 's @entity116 ; @entity118 and @entity115 ; and @entity118 and @entity110			0
in those cases and most others , a new contract was reached and the networks were restored within days			0
the purchase of television programs is the single biggest cost for distributors , who have fought back in recent years against what they consider unreasonable ' carriage fee ' increases by content producers like @entity7			1
companies such as @entity7 tend to bundle their networks together , forcing distributors to carry lower - rated networks , such as @entity93 , along with more popular channels such as @entity4			1
this practice has triggered a debate in the industry about unbundling networks , which would allow customers to choose only the channels that they want to watch , a practice known in industry parlance as " a la carte			0
' ' we 've made it clear we would be happy to do an a la carte deal ; i do n't think that 's likely , that decision is in the hands of @entity7 , ' @entity18 said			2
' a lot of customers ask for a la carte absolutely , a lot of customers would really prefer to buy the channels they watch and not the others , but the contracts we are subject to by the media companies typically tie content together			0
' the possibility of @entity2 dropping @entity7 's networks was raised in a mid-june note by @entity166 analyst @entity165			1
citing falling ratings at @entity3 and other @entity7 networks , @entity165 wrote , " we believe it is no longer inconceivable that a distributor would drop @entity7 , or at least engage in a public battle with them over price increases			1
" despite declining ratings , @entity3 still ranks as the top - rated cable network in the country , based on total day viewers			0
@entity7 took several aggressive steps to put pressure on @entity2 to reach a new deal			1
the company blocked access to its programming online so that @entity2 subscribers would not be able to view its programming on alternate platforms			1
it also created two videos that mocked @entity2 's position and its recent marketing campaign			0
this is not the first time a distributor has blacked out @entity7 's channels due to a contract dispute			1
in 2004 , @entity110 dropped some @entity7 networks after the two sides failed to reach agreement on a new distribution deal			2
that blackout was short - lived , lasting less than 48 hours .			0

shows such as @entity62 and @entity28 will no longer be available to @entity2 subscribers
at issue are price increases @entity7 wants to extract from @entity2 to keep carrying its cable channels
although the two sides are *continuing* to negotiate , analysts said the dispute could drag on for weeks
