officials also said that @entity3 wo n't display premiums for 2015 until the second week of november			0
open enrollment season runs nov. 15 through feb. 15			2
coverage can start as early as jan. 1			0
on the plus side , the health insurance website will feature a streamlined application for most of those signing up for the first time			1
seventy - six screens in the online application have been reduced to 16 , officials said			0
the site has been also optimized for mobile devices			2
@entity22 - language homepage : the @entity22 homepage of the site is clear and does not display any typos that would deter people from signing up @entity27 - language homepage : the @entity27 homepage has the word ' preparase ' which should actually read ' preparese ' and such a big typo might deter @entity31 from signing up for coverage the goof is a mistranslation in large type on the home page of the spanish - language version of the site			1
it 's the very first word on the page			1
trying to translate ' get ready , ' someone came up with the wrong word in @entity27			1
the spanish - language site had lots of problems last year , ranging from technology issues to clunky translations that left some native speakers puzzled			2
the administration struggled to sign up @entity31 , the nation 's largest minority and more likely to be uninsured than other ethnic groups			1
this time , the website designers translated ' get ready ' as preparase			1
it should have been preparese — with an ' e '' instead of an ' a. ' the same mistake appears three times on the @entity27 home page , which is supposed to be a mirror - image of @entity3			1
such a prominent error can unintentionally send a message that the site was not designed to professional standards			1
@entity3 is the online portal to subsidized private health insurance for consumers who do n't have access to a job - based plan			0
it served 36 states last open enrollment season , while the remaining states ran their own insurance exchanges			0

president 's plan @ @entity97 president @entity1 sits next to @entity98 ( r ) as he participates in a briefing with @entity101 doctors and healthcare professionals those returning customers will have just one month — until dec. 15 — to go back into their existing accounts and update their financial information			1
acting by that date will ensure that they are getting the right amount of financial assistance with their premiums at the very start of the new plan year			0
it 's estimated that more than 6 million of the 7.3 million people who signed up under president @entity1 's health law are receiving subsidies , which greatly reduce their premiums			0
after those returning customers update their financial information , insurers say they 'll have to enter a 14 - character plan identifier number on the website if they want to keep their current insurance policy			1
the industry says insurers had hoped that number would be automatically provided by @entity3 — but that was n't possible			0
administration spokesman @entity126 says there 's also a simpler way to do it			2
consumers can select their plan from a list of all the plans they are eligible for on the website			0
existing customers who do nothing will be automatically re-enrolled in their current plan as of jan. 1			2
but they will receive this year 's subsidy amount , which could be lower than what they 'd be entitled to for 2015			0
and that could mean sticker shock over their new monthly premiums			0
officials downplayed those industry concerns on wednesday , saying many returning customers will want to shop around to make sure their current plan is still the best deal for them			1
and those returning customers who miss the dec. 15 date will still have until the end of open enrollment on feb. 15 to update their financial information			1
the change would take effect march 1 , and in the meantime they might have to pay more			0
