last week , in the company of a @entity3 great , @entity0 spoke passionately about the spirit and soul of the club			1
as a nervous , young apprentice , he recalled the cigar smoke from sir @entity10 ’s office wafting through the corridors at @entity12			2
there was a sense of belonging about the place , and he felt the history of the club when he walked out of the tunnel at @entity12 for the first time			2
sense of history : @entity0 ( right ) last week enthused about his youth days at @entity3 the class of 92 : @entity24 ( centre ) and his all - star @entity27 winners , including @entity0 ( sixth left ) glory : the former @entity31 captain enjoys title success with fellow graduate @entity33 ( bottom left ) in 2003 that stuff makes the hairs on your neck stand on end			1
it was at the stadium , after the extensive redevelopment of the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 in the @entity46 , that @entity0 became a modern , matchday idol			1
‘ like having 75,000 parents watching you , ’ he recalled during an instructive half hour with the former @entity3 and @entity31 midfielder			1
in many ways it was a nostalgic trip for @entity0 , winding the clock back to a time when he first trained with @entity3 after winning the @entity55 one summer			1
moving on up : @entity56 celebrates his brilliant double for @entity31 against @entity58 on monday remember the name : a young @entity56 scores a spectacular debut goal for @entity3 against @entity61 in 2008 pastures new : the former @entity3 academy graduate has now moved on to @entity64 for £ 16m @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity33 , the @entity68 brothers and @entity0 were brought up at @entity69 , making their way through the academy before they went on to win the @entity27 in 1992			1
this is all part of the club ’s grand and illustrious past , but as @entity75 looks to the future he must keep the spirit and soul of this club alive			1
this coming friday , the @entity3 manager will speak for the first time about his decision to sell @entity56 to @entity64 on transfer deadline day for £ 16million			1
on paper , with @entity85 being added to a list of forwards that includes captain @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , it was a straightforward decision			1
@entity56 ’s finest moment in a @entity3 shirt was his header at the @entity96 in a @entity98 last - 16 tie against @entity99 in february 2013			1
all in all , there were not enough of them			0
what can not be ignored is his affinity to the club , joining @entity3 ’s academy at the age of eight , having his picture taken with @entity65 and making his way through the club ’s junior teams			1
it is a rich tradition at @entity3 and it is possible that @entity113 is n't even aware that they have included a homegrown player in every matchday squad since 1937			2
it is 3,704 games and counting			0
in their last @entity122 game , at @entity120 prior to the international break , @entity3 started with three graduates from the youth team			1
five more were on the bench			0
that powerful statistic is not in danger yet , but a return to the days when sir @entity129 organised trials for every kid in the north west after his arrival in november 1986 are long gone			2
those trials , supervised by the former youth coach @entity24 , harvested the class of 92			1
they will never see the like again			0
instead , @entity3 are operating in an era of rampant commercialisation			2
every square inch of this club is for sale			0
every quarter brings another outstanding set of financial results and with it the news of another sponsorship deal with a food or soda supplier from south - east @entity151			0
to keep pace with @entity99 , @entity155 and @entity156 in the annual @entity157 , that is what they have to do			0
next season they will revert to adidas , switching kit manufacturer after striking a deal that is thought to be worth £ 750m over the next 10 years			0
these glorified announcements are a modern trend , a flag - waving exercise designed to pacify those restless supporters who are concerned about the direction of this institution			0
they have entered the messy world of third - party ownership after bringing @entity85 on loan from @entity175 for a season , with an option to sign the striker permanently next summer			1
he is a first - class forward , but you have to question the influence of those in his inner circle when he opted to join @entity175 , a team who were not in the @entity98 at the time , instead of a @entity190 superpower in 2013			0
@entity155 , @entity99 and @entity191 all turned down the chance to sign one of the world ’s best forwards this summer			0
there has to be good reason for that			0
@entity113 has not had a break since the @entity200 , charging straight into his new role at @entity3 and the @entity203 tour that he complained about so bitterly			2
much of that was down to his own mental fatigue			0
the recruitment strategy is incoherent , throwing money at the problem by signing @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity85			2
splashing the cash : @entity85 is @entity75 's latest blockbuster signing for the @entity215 overhaul : the @entity218 boss poses with @entity219 after adding the defender to his rapidly - changing squad record breaker : @entity212 ( right ) was signed for an eyewatering £ 60m from @entity99 it is to be hoped that they all come good , particularly given the sense of urgency that has prevailed since @entity227 was fired last april			1
@entity227 got it wrong , of course , misjudging the mood of the place after @entity129 retired after winning his 11th @entity122 title in 2013			0
@entity113 has promised glory eventually , committing himself to various targets over the past few weeks			0
along the way , he will have to take a bit of history with him			0
video @entity64 spending does n't guarantee success - @entity239			2

@entity3 sold @entity56 to @entity64 for £ 16m
@entity56 had grown up as part of the club 's youth academy
@entity31 striker is one of a long line of famous @entity3 graduates
class of 92 was stellar group of young stars , including @entity0 , @entity33 , @entity66 and the @entity68 brothers
@entity75 picked three youth players against @entity120
but @entity3 have since spent big on @entity85 and other *expensive* *overseas* imports
