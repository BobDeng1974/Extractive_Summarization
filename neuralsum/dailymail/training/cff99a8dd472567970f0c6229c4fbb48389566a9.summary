one of the most anticipated ' coming out ' moments was when @entity2 swimming legend @entity1 revealed he was gay in a paid interview and now it 's being celebrated despite the move dividing the homoseuxal community			1
the interview by @entity9 journalist @entity8 , which was reported to have seen the @entity11 pocket up to $ 500,000 , has been nominated for a media award at this year 's @entity13 which recognises achievements within @entity16 â€™s lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex ( @entity21 ) community			1
the public revelation made global headlines while polarising the @entity21 community with some believing that the 31 - year - old should have felt comfortable in living an open gay life much earlier			2
' it 's appropriate to recognise what the interview did and we were extremely supportive of what @entity1 did , ' he said			1
' it 's a measure of how far we have come that he has come out but it 's also a measure of how far we have to go that it ' s a media story			0
' mr @entity32 said it was particularly hard for male athletes to deal with their sexuality			0
' we would never say that a sportsperson has to come out , or any individual , and certainly we understand the pressures on athletes given his particular role in @entity2 sport and culture , ' he said			0
' things are changing but at the moment the number of openly out male athletes is very small			0
' the @entity11 was reported to have pocketed up to $ 500,000 for the tell - all @entity1 admitted to considering coming out at the @entity61 in 2000 in the interview			2
