the population of wild lions in @entity5 is estimated to be as low as 15,000 the west @entity9 lion is on the verge of extinction , according to experts after a marked decline in recent years			1
it is estimated there are just 645 genetically distinct wild lions left in western and central @entity5 , with as few as 34 remaining in the whole of @entity18			1
now experts from conservation group lionaid say they are ‘ in real danger of extinction ’			0
according to the group , there are no lions left in 25 @entity9 countries and populations are barely surviving in ten			1
clusters of lions remain in @entity30 , @entity31 , the @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 but are already extinct in countries such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
thirty years ago there were 200,000 lions roaming wild across the continent – but now there are only between 15,000 and 32,000 left			2
@entity9 lions have been largely forgotten due to political apathy to conservation			1
dr @entity47 , trustee of @entity48 , told @entity49 : ‘ there has been a catastrophic decline in the populations of lions in @entity5 , and particularly west @entity5			2
‘ these lions have been neglected for a very long time and do not have adequate protection programs			0
’ he said the west of the continent is often ignored in favour of eastern @entity5 , leading to a decline in species			2
the lion is threatened by a range of factors , including loss of habitat , loss of natural prey due to poaching , ' unsustainable levels of trophy hunting ' and human conflict			0
a new threat is also on the rise as lion bones are being used to supply the demands of @entity78 traditional medicine as tiger bones become more scarce			0
conservationists want lions to be put on the list of most endangered species to give them greater protection from hunters in @entity18 a government wildlife official told @entity49 that the number of lions in the country had dropped from 44 in 2009 to a meagre 34			1
@entity90 from @entity18 ’s interior ministry told the newspaper they are trying to protect the lions but admitted to being ‘ very concerned ’			0
dr @entity94 said it would now be impossible to build up a population of lions in @entity18 and therefore the species should be classed as extinct there as well			2
the picture is similar in other countries			0
in @entity102 , the @entity48 said there are just 40 lions left			0
the charity said there are only five ' viable ' populations - those of 1,000 or more - lions left on the continent			0
three of those are found in @entity113 and @entity114 , with the remaining populations surviving in @entity5 and @entity116 and @entity117			2
lions are now extinct in 25 @entity9 nations recent studies on african lion populations show that about three - quarters of @entity5 ’s savannah has disappeared over the past 50 years			1
conservationists say it is not possible to individually count every lion in the continent so estimates on remaining population numbers vary			2
however experts do agree the plight of the @entity9 lion is ‘ very serious ’ and want the animal to be included on the convention on international trade in endangered species list			1
inclusion would mean tight protection on hunting and trade , especially important as more than 5,600 wild @entity9 lions were hunted and exported as trophies between 1999 and 2008			1
however , conservationists say they face strong opposition from the pro-hunting lobby			0
dr @entity94 said : ' we are currently paying lip service to the conservation needs of a species so greatly important to our cultures , history , and indeed the health of wildlife biodiversity in @entity5			0
' @entity118 are not only an iconic species important to very many people all over the world , but they are also a vital component of @entity9 ecosystems			1

lionaid say there are just 645 wild lions remaining in west and @entity161
there are no lions in 25 @entity9 countries and are only just surviving in ten
