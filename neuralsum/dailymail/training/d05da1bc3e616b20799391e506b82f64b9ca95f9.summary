by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 20 may 2013 a rare , antique torpedo that was last fired almost 120 years ago has been uncovered at the bottom of the ocean - by a dolphin working for the @entity5			1
the bottlenose , named ten , found the brass relic , known as the @entity9 torpedo , during a routine patrol and reconnaissance training mission off the coast of @entity13			1
the @entity5 employs dolphins - and some sea lions - to scour the depths for mines , shipwrecks and enemy divers			1
but 19th century naval weaponry is a particularly rare find , especially one that has lain undisturbed on the ocean bed since 1895			0
military marvel : in its heyday , the 11 - foot @entity9 torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically - advanced pieces of military hardware in the @entity5 's arsenal ' we 've never found anything like this , ' @entity33 , who heads the dolphin search programme , told the @entity38			1
' in its heyday , the 11 - foot @entity9 torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation and one of the most technologically - advanced pieces of military hardware in the @entity5 's arsenal			1
fired from above water or through submerged torpedo tubes , it could cut silently through the water at speeds of 25 knots and sink an unsuspecting enemy warship from up to 700 yards away			1
clever boy : @entity5 sailors with the @entity52 pose with a specially trained @entity54 bottle - nosed dolphin who found the torpedo antique warfare : torpedo boat @entity58 firing a @entity9 torpedo in 1895 only fifty were ever built by a @entity62 company between 1870 and 1899 , before it was outdated by another prototype made by a rival firm			1
' considering it was made before electricity was provided to @entity72 households , it was pretty sophisticated for its time , ' @entity65 , operations supervisor for the biosciences division at the @entity67 , told the @entity38			2

only fifty were ever built by a @entity62 company between 1870 and 1899 , before it was outdated by another made by a rival firm			2
made of brass , the projectile was driven by a 132 - pound flywheel spun to 10,000 rpm before launch			1
after years of development , three prototypes were tested in 1885 in @entity97			0
despite watching the first two grind to a halt and sink shortly after deployment , its makers returned to the drawing board and tweaked its mechanism			2
soon they were issued to the @entity5 , becoming the first automobile torpedo issued to the fleet			2
until now , it was believed there was just one left in existence - on display at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			2
it is perhaps ironic that something seen at the time as an embodiment of technological advancement was discovered more than a century later by trained mammals and not state - of - the - art computers			2
but the @entity5 is increasingly turning to dolphins to search the ocean beds , because their on - board scanning systems remain unmatched by any man - made sonar			1
currently there are 80 bottlenosed dolphins and 50 sealions being trained at @entity130 facility for mine detection , mine clearing and swimmer protection			0
indeed , during the 2003 @entity136 invasion , dolphins were dispatched to the @entity137 to hunt for mines and enemy divers			1
they are also used to guard submarines in @entity142 and @entity114			0
experts say they are swifter and more accurate at detecting undersea objects than even the most sophisticated technology thanks to a keen eyesight and mysteriously - complex bio-sonar system			0
' dolphins naturally possess the most sophisticated sonar known to man , ' @entity148 , an official at the @entity52 , told the @entity38			0
to train them , sea wildlife experts drop objects of different shapes and sizes into the sea in areas of poor visibility			0
if they find something they return to the surface and tap their snout on the front of the boat			0
if they find nothing they tap their snout on the stern			0
their first clue was when ten the dolphin returned from a shallow dive and tapped the boat 's bow			2
his handlers thought nothing of it			0
but when @entity183 's colleague @entity182 did the exact same thing suspicions were aroused			0
navy divers dove to investigate the mysterious object , broken in two pieces , and found a stamp on one section that read : ' @entity189 '			0
it was carefully hauled to the surface and taken to the @entity192 in @entity114 to be cleaned up .			0

the relic was uncovered by ten the bottlenose dolphin off @entity13 coast
the 11 - foot @entity9 torpedo was considered a masterpiece of innovation
was made of brass , travelled at 25 knots and could sink ship from 700 yards
the @entity5 employs dolphins to scour depths for mines and enemy divers
