@entity1 visitors are being forced to wait their turn at some of the national park ’s drinking stations after thirsty elk figured out how to help themselves to water			1
the crafty animals are surprising tourists by lifting spring - loaded levers with their noses to get a refreshing drink			1
but the animals are being overly protective and have acted aggressively toward hikers , forcing @entity1 officials to take steps to elk - proof at least one water station			1
water you doing ? @entity20 interact with visitors at the @entity23 water station at @entity24 after banning disposable plastic water bottles and installing water stations in an attempt to reduce waste , park officials are now experimenting with a cage around the spouts at one water station and will change the way it is turned on			1
around a dozen of the filling stations are set up , but the elk favour one at @entity38 because it allows them to easily duck back into the woods			1
the elk do n't always back down when visitors approach			0
instead , they take a firm stance , particularly when protecting calves or during fall rutting season			0
chief resource officer @entity46 said : ‘ they got a little aggressive about it			0
they were pretty protective of that water and wanting to get it first			2
’ @entity20 have figured out how to use the water stations by lifting spring - loaded levers with their noses @entity57 , @entity56 resident @entity55 was hiking rim to rim at the canyon with three other people in 2012 when they saw an elk guarding the water station at @entity38			1
the elk tried to intimidate the group by making clicking sounds with its mouth and following them on either side of the filling station , he said			0
@entity55 said : ‘ it definitely was a “ go away ” kind of thing			0
she was n't wanting to share			0
’ still , he said elk encounters are part of experiencing nature and he saw no problem with them at the watering stations			2
park officials say elk have been guarding one water station and intimidating visitors who approach it there have been no reports of visitors being injured , but the elk have charged at wildlife biologists trying to disperse herds by staring them down or shooting them with paintball and water guns , said wildlife biologist @entity95			1
he said : ‘ some move , some do n't			0
sometimes when you shoot them with water guns , they open their mouth			0
’ if the new water station design works , it will be used at the rest of the stations .			2
