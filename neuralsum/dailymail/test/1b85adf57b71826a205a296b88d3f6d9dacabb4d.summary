@entity1 manager @entity0 has not ruled out the prospect of @entity3 or @entity4 earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club 's future			1
both centre - backs ' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely @entity4 , who is 38 in december and has played more for the under - 21s in the last month than he has the first team , will be retained			1
@entity3 , 33 in july , has more of a chance of securing a short - term extension as @entity0 looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer			1
@entity0 insists 37 - year - old defender @entity4 still has time to prove he deserves a new deal @entity3 , who joined @entity1 from @entity20 where he played under @entity0 , could get a new deal while the @entity1 boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - @entity24 and @entity26 the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players			1
' there are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players ( @entity33 and @entity34 ) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season , ' said @entity0			1
' the next six games could have a massive bearing on that			0
ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people 's views			0
' all individuals will be judged over that period			0
in football it does not matter if you have a contract or not , you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club			0
' but when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club , it is the player as well			2
' @entity0 says his club 's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months @entity4 has played more for @entity1 's youth team than the first xi in the past month , and could be on his way @entity0 said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and , while he would not confirm publicly , @entity73 's on - loan @entity71 midfielder @entity70 , out of contract at the end of the season , is believed to be one of them			1
' the recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad , ' @entity0 said			2
' first and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future			0
@entity70 , who is on loan at @entity73 , is a target , with @entity0 having worked with him before ' the dressing room is very strong as it is now , so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place			1
' we know the situation with @entity70			0
he is a player that i know well having worked with him ( in a previous loan spell at @entity20 ) - and that 's it			0
' @entity70 is a player that is at the moment fighting for something very important for his club and that deserves respect			2
' i would n't expect anyone to speak about my players and i would never do that			0
