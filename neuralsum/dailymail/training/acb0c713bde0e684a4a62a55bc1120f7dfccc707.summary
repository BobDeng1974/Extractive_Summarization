by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:30 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 19 february 2013 @entity2 yesterday warned @entity3 not to split the @entity4 by siding with @entity5 in the @entity6 over calls for a new @entity8			1
the prime minister told reporters he would be ‘ disappointed ’ if his deputy opted to vote for the controversial policy which would impose a swingeing tax on homes worth more than £ 2 million			1
but mr @entity3 refused to rule out siding with @entity5 to back a policy that has long been a cherished @entity16 goal			1
clash : the prime minister @entity2 , left , has said he will be ' rather disappointed ' if his deputy @entity3 , right , supports @entity5 's mansion tax policy @entity5 is planning to drive a wedge between the @entity4 partners by forcing a @entity6 vote on the principle of a @entity8 in the coming weeks			1
a @entity5 source taunted mr @entity3 yesterday , saying : ' here is a chance for @entity3 to prove he can keep at least one of his promises			2
' labour leader @entity29 his hoping to drive a wedge between the @entity4 partners with his mansion tax policy @entity32 has said all ministers will be expected to back @entity35 policy , which is against a @entity8 , in any vote			1
but business secretary @entity37 has indicated he may side with @entity5 and mr @entity3 also suggested yesterday that he might vote against the prime minister on the issue			1
he told @entity40 : ‘ neither @entity37 nor i know what will be put before us so we ca n’t of course determine in advance how we would vote			0
‘ but of course the @entity16 for a long time have been the leading advocate of greater fairness in tax			1
‘ the conservatives do n’t want to do that			0
they do n’t want , perhaps , to offend people in very large mansions			0
‘ they need to answer for themselves			0
i ’m absolutely sure that what we stand for is the right thing			0
’ during a round of interviews in @entity61 yesterday mr @entity2 suggested that for @entity16 ministers to vote with @entity5 on the motion could break the terms of the @entity4 deal			1
asked about whether mr @entity3 would vote with @entity5 , he said : ‘ i have n’t asked him the question , but as it ’s not in the @entity69 to have a @entity8 , i would be rather disappointed if he did			2
’ mr @entity2 made light of suggestions that the @entity29 ’s initiative might tempt mr @entity3 into a future coalition with @entity5			2
row : @entity2 told a press conference during his trip to @entity61 the mansion tax was not part of the @entity69 ‘ that ’s a matter for him to answer , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s enough running one coalition , without trying to work out what another one would be			0
’ meanwhile , @entity83 moved to rule out any @entity8 , describing it as a ‘ tax con ’ which would quickly be applied to much more modest homes			2
the chancellor said : ‘ it ’s very costly to implement			0
it means you have to send inspectors round the country valuing all the homes - not just the homes worth over two million but those worth less ... it ’s actually a tax con that you know there are n’t that many mansions in the country that can be taxed to pay for some tax cut for millions of people			0
' so either it ’s a tax con and the money comes from somewhere else or it ’s soon a homes tax and they say it ’s a mansion tax before the election and then very quickly becomes a homes tax on many people who are not living in mansions at all			1
’ meanwhile , mr @entity3 will risk charges of complacency over the @entity112 by - election by jetting off to @entity114 on holiday			2
his party are facing their biggest by - election test in years as they seek to defend the @entity120 seat vacated by disgraced former cabinet minister @entity121			0
they insist they are taking nothing for granted , especially as their conservative coalition partners are the main challengers			0
but the @entity16 leader is pressing ahead with a ‘ long weekend ’ in @entity114			2
a party source said : ‘ @entity127 has taken the children for half - term and he wants to be there for their youngest son ’s birthday			0
