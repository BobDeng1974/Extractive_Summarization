@entity2 , 91 , died from bronchial pneumonia five days after he was admitted to @entity15 earlier this month			1
but his widow , 85 - year - old @entity17 , daughter @entity16 and her husband @entity19 , were only informed that he had died when a bereavement worker at the hospital contacted mrs @entity22 two days afterwards			2

the family claim that the home also had contact details for @entity16 and @entity19			0

' mr @entity2 , a resident at the @entity23 - run @entity38 care home in @entity15 , @entity41 , was admitted to hospital on may 17			1
