‘ people need to realise that when they say the things they do , it can have deeply traumatising effects and can lead to self - harm and suicide , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity7 ’s death was not just because of it but the bullying she faced all her life certainly contributed			1
’ the teenager , who was a gifted cellist and singer , had been out with friends just hours before she died and was said to be ‘ very happy ’ when she said goodbye to them			0

she also played the lead role of @entity79 in her school ’s musical we will rock you			0

‘ it ’s a serious matter and i can not see how being ginger is any less qualifying for the additional category of hate crime that being a goth is			1
’ @entity167 , national co-ordinator for the @entity154 , said attacks on ginger people should be dealt with in the same way as any other prejudice			1
he added : ‘ for people with ginger hair bullying seems to be acceptable – the norm			1
that ’s what makes it totally inappropriate			0
’ @entity178 councillor @entity177 , who also has red hair , said : ‘ people laugh at me when i say it ’s almost as if ginger - haired people are our own race			2
‘ but it ’s like that – we ’re beaten and made fun of just the same as someone is by a racist because they ’re black			0
‘ i went to a football match and the doorman said , “ sorry , we do n’t let ginger people in ” – this was a full grown man making fun of another adult			1
