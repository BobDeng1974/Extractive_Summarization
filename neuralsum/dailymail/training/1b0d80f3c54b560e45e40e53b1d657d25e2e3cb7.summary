@entity0 has blamed the recent storms on the decision to legalise gay marriage @entity4 hit back at attacks on @entity6 , after he suspended a councillor who blamed the @entity9 and @entity10 floods on @entity12 ’s decision to legalise gay marriage			1
@entity0 claimed last week that the country had been ‘ beset by storms ’ because the prime minister had acted ‘ arrogantly against the gospel ’ by passing same - sex marriage laws			1
@entity6 ’s leadership had originally refused to discipline mr @entity0 , 73 , a town councillor in @entity20 , @entity21 , saying that everyone was entitled to their religious views			1
but he was finally suspended yesterday afternoon after defying a request not to do further interviews on his beliefs			2
however , mr @entity4 today suggested that the remarks had only become a story after mr @entity0 joined @entity6 from the @entity32 party , where he had previously aired similar views			1
speaking in a question - and - answer session in the @entity36 , the @entity6 leader said : ' i think it is very interesting that , when mr @entity0 was saying these things in 2012 and 2013 as a conservative town councillor in @entity20 , it was not a news story			2
but suddenly he switches to @entity6 and continues the same thing and gets on the national news			0
' i think that shows you and tells you all you need to know			0
the establishment , the status quo , the big businesses , the big @entity50 and our three so - called main political parties are scared witless by what @entity6 is doing because we are striking a chord not just for ordinary people but for many elements in the business community as well			0
' they will try to do whatever they can to shoot us down			0
' mr @entity0 angered party bosses by going on local radio to say that being gay was a ‘ spiritual disease ’ which can be healed			1
the move came as mr @entity4 launched a clearout of ‘ extremist , nasty or barmy ’ views from the party ahead of polls in may			2
@entity6 leader @entity4 said mr @entity0 's comments had only become a story since he defected from the @entity32 party it emerged at the weekend that five of the party ’s current @entity77 have been told they will not be able to stand again			1
@entity79 , the conservative business minister , said the @entity0 affair showed that ‘ there clearly are one or two fruitcakes still around there ’			2
he told the @entity88 ’s @entity87 : ‘ [ the @entity32 are ] the only party that can actually secure reform and give people the choice they ’ve been arguing for a long time			1
whatever happens in the @entity94 elections , it is simply a protest vote			0
’ ' went against requests ' : @entity4 tweeted about mr @entity0 's suspension mr @entity0 wrote another letter to the @entity98 in april 2012 in which he told @entity12 not to legalise gay marriage and warned of ' disasters ' if he did the comments echo mr @entity12 ’s attack on @entity6 members as ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’ – a comment from which he backtracked			1
mr @entity0 made his original comments in a letter to a local newspaper			1
@entity113 : part of the letter in the @entity98 , claiming recent floods were godly vengeance he was suspended after going on @entity119 to say that the new legislation , paving the way for the first gay marriages in the spring , was the latest mistake which would anger @entity124			1
mr @entity0 said he had learnt at bible college that there was no proof that the ‘ gay condition ’ comes from the genes , and that through the @entity130 , a gay person can be healed			2
‘ there is healing for the gay condition and i believe a @entity135 should long for gay people to be healed and to have normal heterosexual lives , ’ he said			2
‘ it is nonsense to say it is homophobic			0
it is a spiritual disease ... it ’s not what i say , it ’s what the @entity141 says			0
’ @entity144 users reacted angrily to his comments , branding him a ' blithering idiot ' and questioning his position as councillor			0
@entity149 , a graduate from @entity150 , said : ' what is a man like @entity0 doing in public office ? disgrace			2
' another user calling himself @entity155 , from @entity156 , added : ' @entity6 councillor @entity0 says the floods are due to gay marriage			1
why do people take @entity6 seriously ? seriously , how ? ' @entity20 's @entity32 mp @entity160 , added : ' i thought mr @entity0 's letter was not the sort of thing that he should have written in today 's age			1
he really needs to consider his position			0
' @entity6 is riding high in the polls and is expected to do well in may ’s @entity94 elections			0
yesterday one survey suggested voters regard mr @entity4 ’s party more ‘ favourably ’ than any of the three main parties			0
another poll found that mr @entity4 is the second most popular party leader , behind mr @entity12			0
since christmas eve several storms have left tens of thousands without power across the @entity176 , caused damage to homes and businesses and disrupted transport			0

@entity0 , 73 , wrote a letter to the @entity98 in @entity21
in it he said storms were @entity124 's *punishment* for legalising gay marriage
@entity0 , former @entity32 who defected over the issue , **defended** his views
he has now been suspended by his party despite previously **defended** him
