by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 03:26 est , 16 november 2012 the @entity1 , which advertises itself as ‘ @entity3 ’s most prestigious prize for political writing ’ , was first awarded in 1994			1
in 2007 , the @entity8 offshoot , the @entity5 ( mst ) , became the lead partner in running the prize			0
the @entity1 no doubt chimed with the @entity12 political leanings of the @entity6 ’s founders and would be a beacon for the journalistic excellence and integrity that they espoused			1
for the 2008 prize — the first to be awarded under @entity21 ’s @entity6 ’s auspices — the three judges were @entity22 , novelist and formerly a journalist on the @entity25 and @entity26 , former @entity28 executive sir @entity27 and @entity29 , @entity26 journalist , @entity6 trustee and husband of @entity31 , boss of the @entity34 - donating @entity33 , friend of @entity8 ’s founder @entity36 and financial backer of the @entity5			0
compromised : journalist @entity38 returned his @entity1 after it emerged that he had invented eyewitness accounts their award of the prize to independent journalist @entity38 was the start of a farce that was to badly compromise both the mst and @entity3 ’s most high - minded paper			1
a youthful , left - wing polemicist with a taste for grandstanding , @entity38 was seemingly the perfect fit for the @entity6 ’s first foray into journalism awards			2
( @entity38 ’s admiring boss @entity52 would be invited by the @entity6 to join its ‘ non-partisan ’ review panel later that year			1
) @entity38 ’s award was given in spite of serious and long - standing concerns about the integrity of his work			2
@entity59 ran a long piece in early 2003 , which identified several @entity38 reportage pieces for @entity26 and @entity62 in which he had simply invented his eyewitness accounts			1
criticised : sir @entity21 's journalism - improving projects have hardly been entirely successful but @entity38 ’s offences against journalism were much wider than simply making up ‘ facts ’			1
@entity82 , the use of old quotes as if they were new in interviews , alteration of @entity75 biographies of enemies and ‘ sock puppetry ’ — the use of false identities to attack people on the internet — were also part of his modus operandi			0
by june 2011 the evidence against him became so overwhelming , that the mst had to act and instructed the @entity1 council to launch an inquiry into the allegations			2
within a month the @entity1 issued a statement , in which it said : ‘ no allegations have been made against @entity38 ’s 2008 @entity1 - winning pieces			1
’ given the clear evidence of @entity38 ’s dishonesty , this was disingenuous			1
in any event , both @entity59 and the @entity95 brought new allegations that @entity38 had made up parts of one of the @entity1 - winning pieces , about atrocities in the @entity102			1
in september 2011 , @entity38 announced that , though he stood by the articles which had won the @entity1 , he would be returning it as an act of contrition for the errors he had made elsewhere			1
@entity107 later confirmed that he would have been stripped of the prize because of evidence of wrongdoing in one of his articles			0
the result ? a bitter blow to the journalistic integrity of @entity3 ’s so - called @entity116			0
but also to the credibility of the organisation which has given itself the role of determining the way the free press is regulated			0
worse , much worse , was to follow with another of sir @entity21 ’s journalism - improving projects			0
the @entity124 was launched in 2010 , funded by a £ 2million grant from @entity127 computer millionaire and @entity34 donor @entity128 and his @entity21 and @entity129			2
sir @entity21 , champion of what he regards as an ethical press , became a trustee			0
the @entity124 was run out of @entity135 ’s @entity134 , which three years earlier had awarded sir @entity21 an honorary degree			2
power : @entity21 is a trustee of the @entity124 and an assessor for @entity140			2
( from left to right ) @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity21 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 as we have reported , the @entity124 proclaimed itself as the ‘ gold standard ’ by which other journalism could be measured			1
its output and reportage ‘ should be as close to incontrovertible as is possible ’			0
there were a number of experienced journalists with good track records on board			0
but while the @entity124 won acclaim in some quarters , there was also criticism			0
six months after launch , the @entity124 was working with @entity26 and other news organisations in preparing the @entity164 release of classified @entity166 military documents			1
but in giving an interview to an @entity166 magazine , @entity124 managing editor @entity167 leaked ‘ major details ’ which , @entity26 said this weekend , ‘ put the entire project in jeopardy ’			1
an investigation of the @entity175 charity was also described by its subject as ‘ misleading ’			0
damaged reputation : former managing editor of the @entity124 , @entity167 , has stepped down this week following the @entity180 scandal earlier this year , one of the @entity124 ’s staff confided that the original seed money had almost run out and the @entity124 needed to secure new revenue sources			1
they have even turned to very unlikely benefactors such as @entity186			0
but there was an ever greater need to find paid work at relatively wealthy channels such as the @entity28			0
which is how they came to be working with @entity193 on a child abuse investigation			0
the subsequent disaster was heralded by @entity197 ’s now infamous tweet : ‘ if all goes well , we ’ve got a @entity193 out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile			1
’ on tuesday , @entity21 and his fellow @entity124 trustees had a letter published in the @entity25			1
the tone was defiant rather than chastened			0
‘ the @entity28 required and had full editorial control throughout the production of the @entity193 programme , ’ they said			0
and they further qualified the @entity124 ’s role in the scandal : ‘ we regret that a tweet by the @entity124 ’s managing editor in advance of the programme helped to feed inaccurate speculation about the identity of a political figure			1
’ the letter ended : ‘ the @entity124 ’s work has won awards by disclosing important information in the public interest and , with only this recent exception , by maintaining high standards of journalism			2
the @entity124 remains absolutely committed to that aim			0
’ whether the @entity124 — of which @entity227 is a trustee — will survive to maintain those ‘ high standards ’ is a matter of some considerable doubt .			2

independent journalist @entity38 received the @entity1 for his writing
it then emerged he had fabricated ' eyewitness ' accounts , and he returned it
the @entity124 's managing editor , @entity167 , leaked details of classified documents while preparing a @entity164 release
he later tweeted about the paedophile scandal and ' helped to feed inaccurate speculation about the identity of a political figure ’
