hundreds of thousands of mothers - to - be should give birth at home or in midwife - led units rather than in hospital , the health watchdog says			1
almost half of the 700,000 women who have babies every year in @entity9 and @entity10 are at such low risk of complications they do not need to visit the labour ward , says @entity15			2
new guidelines published today say a smaller , midwife - led unit is just as safe as hospital for first - time mothers			1
bonding : almost half of women could have a home birth without severe risk , say new guidelines ( file photo ) for those having their second child , a home delivery is just as safe as in hospital and usually a far more joyful experience			2
yet figures show that just 2.3 per cent of women currently have home deliveries and a further 4 per cent in midwife units , while the remainder head to hospital			1
it marks a major shift in guidelines , which had previously urged caution over home births as the risks were deemed higher			1
the watchdog says it has now examined new evidence , including an @entity46 study of 64,000 women , which showed that home births and units were safer because they are less likely to involve high - risk interventions such as caesarean sections , epidurials or deliveries with forceps			1
such procedures may be carried out too readily by doctors , while midwives are thought to have a more patient approach , it says			0
the big debate : the watchdog said it had studied new evidence including a study of 64,000 women the research did , however , show that home births are marginally more dangerous for the baby for first - time mothers – although the risks are very small			1
avoiding hospital also saves the @entity70 money			0
figures show that a hospital birth costs £ 1,631 , while it costs £ 1,450 for a midwife centre and £ 1,066 for a home birth			2
however , @entity15 stressed that new evidence on risk – and not cost – was the reason for the change			1
professor @entity80 , @entity15 ’s clinical practice director , said : ‘ most women are healthy and have straightforward pregnancies and births			1
over the years , evidence has emerged which shows that , for this group of women , giving birth in a midwife - led unit instead of a traditional labour ward is a safe option			1
mothers are being warned that falling asleep with their babies while breastfeeding in bed is linked to cot death			0
the health watchdog @entity15 says it increases the risk of @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , although it stopped short of telling women not to sleep with their newborns because it may interfere with breastfeeding			2
it said exhausted parents should not feel guilty if they find they have accidentally nodded off with the baby , but must be aware of the ‘ association ’ with @entity98			0
experts are not clear what causes sids , previously known as cot death , but it may be due to suffocation , infection or genetics			0
professor @entity80 of @entity15 admitted it was a ‘ confusing ’ message , but added : ‘ we ’re not telling people not to co-sleep with their babies , we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding , but it ’s better that parents should know and make their own judgments			2
’ ‘ research also shows that a home birth is generally safer than hospital for pregnant women at low risk of complications who have given birth before			0
’ professor @entity129 , who drew up the guidelines , said birth was now ‘ mostly ’ safe but said there is no ‘ one size fits all ’ choice of location during labour			0
she added : ‘ some women may prefer to have their baby at home or in a midwife - led unit because they are generally safer – that is their right and they should be supported in that choice			1
‘ but if a woman would prefer to have her baby in a hospital because it makes her feel ‘ safer ’ , that is also her right			0
’ @entity15 said that overall , giving birth at home or in midwife - led units was a far happier experience			1
however , women who are obese or have asthma , diabetes or epilepsy or who have had a previous difficult birth are urged to go to hospital			0
midwives and gps are now urged to spell out the options open to women and make it clear that hospitals are not necessarily safest			0
professor @entity165 , of the @entity166 , said there was now better emphasis on patient choice			0
@entity170 , chief executive of the @entity171 , added : ‘ it is important that women feel able to make the choices that are right for them			0

push towards small midwife - led units by @entity15 marks major *policy* shift
watchdog said it examined new evidence including 64,000 - mother study
but home births still marginally more dangerous for first - time mothers
