no , the richest fight of all time has not been set in paper , let alone stone			0
yes , the lines on the contract still wait to be dotted , let alone signed upon by @entity6 and @entity7			1
but yes , also , the big businesses needed to help generate the prize - ring ’s first £ 200million bonanza are swinging into action already			1
the travel industry , especially			0
@entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 chat at an @entity14 match last month air and accommodation packages have now gone on sale here in @entity19 for the second half of the week ending saturday , may 2 in @entity21			1
cost – anything up to £ 4,000 - a - head for deals based on flights in economy			1
the @entity26 – the giant resort and casino on that neon @entity21 in the desert – has been keeping its @entity30 on hold for some time now			1
more significantly it has just raised its basic room rates for the nights of may 1 and 2 – by more than treble to in excess of $ 500 ( £ 325 ) for the first time			0
other hotels in @entity21 are also hiking their prices			1
all the above are selling like hot cakes			0
everyone is gambling that the deal of the century will be done			0
packages to watch the potential £ 200million bout are already on sale with some companies it is believed that ringside seats will cost $ 5,000 ( £ 3,250 ) each , with the pay - per - view subscriptions in the @entity51 being priced at $ 100 ( £ 65 ) each ... if it happens			1
the only thing which might bring it all crashing down in is a premature announcement that the fight is truly on			0
one of @entity6 ’s stipulations is that he makes the announcement			2
@entity7 has publicly conceded that privilege			2
but wishful media speculation that he has signed a contract , supposedly based on information from unattributed sources close to the @entity65 camp , threaten to crush the hopes of the boxing world , the @entity7 himself included			1
@entity6 does not like that			2
he dismissed the story out of hand when he attended the @entity14 all - star game in @entity72 at the weekend , when many expected him to declare the fight on : ‘ it ’s not true			2
i ’ve not signed yet			0
he ’s not signed yet			0
it ’s all speculation and rumour			0
’ the @entity79 ’s @entity78 paymaster @entity77 confirmed : ‘ there is no contract yet			0
sorry to tell the truth			0
’ @entity6 attends the @entity14 all - star match at @entity85 in @entity72 on sunday still , there were sighs of relief all round when @entity6 added : ‘ hopefully we can make it happen			1
’ maybe the thought of the fortune to be made softened his stance a little			0
the most recent estimates suggest that @entity6 stands to bank a minimum of $ 150m ( £ 97m ) , @entity7 at least $ 100m ( £ 65m )			1
there are suggestions that only two sticking points remain to be unglued , one between @entity78 and the @entity100 television network who deal with @entity7 , the other involving two rival beer breweries who each sponsor one of the boxers			1
@entity107 president @entity106 is blaming the delay on ' abuse of power '			0
although he is not sure by whom			0
@entity106 , on a flying visit to @entity111 said : ' it could be one or both the fighters , promoters , the managers , or the tv stations but i want to make it clear its not us			0
' @entity7 lands a left hook on @entity121 on his way to victory in @entity124 back in november @entity6 is this organisation 's world welterweight champion and @entity106 adds : ' we are doing everything possible to remove any obstacle from this happening			1
it 's not fair to the fans if they do n't make this fight , which everyone wants to see			0
it will be terrible it it does n't happen this year because it would be bring so much greater exposure to boxing and transform the sport			0
' even so , he raised the prospects of it happening this year rather than next as ' no better than 50 - 50			2
' meanwhile , the long wait goes on			0
but even as it does so boxing lovers the world over , in their anxiety about missing out , are gambling on advance bookings			0
in terms of his credibility and his legacy , it may not be wise for @entity6 to disappoint them			2
@entity154 has been promised that if he remains patient he is guaranteed his world super middleweight title shot later this year			1
@entity157 was disappointed when the @entity107 suddenly granted @entity158 the right to a voluntary defence of their belt prior to meeting his mandatory challenge of @entity154			2
@entity158 is being allowed to fight an opponent of his choice in april but @entity107 president @entity106 assures @entity154 : ' @entity158 will then have to fight @entity167 by the autumn			1
' @entity154 has been told he will have a world super middleweight title fight this year @entity171 truly believes he can become the first boxer to defeat the most dangerous fighter on the planet			1
@entity175 , the heaviest pound - for - pound puncher in the world , says he will defend his middleweight crown by knock - out when they meet in the ring in @entity182 this saturday night			1
@entity171 , who came up only narrowly short in his two previous world title challenges to @entity184 in @entity185 and @entity186 in @entity187 , says : ‘ i ’m not afraid of him			1
’ in that , at the very least , we can believe him			0
@entity171 takes on hard - hitting @entity175 in @entity182 on saturday night @entity175 has promised to knock out the @entity191 and retain his @entity193 and @entity194 belts but it would be a monumental achievement for the impressively reformed convict from @entity198 to overcome the unbeaten @entity199			1
@entity175 knocks out opponents for fun , as @entity203 warrior @entity202 is one of many to have discovered already			2
@entity204 , @entity206 ’s holder of another version of the middleweight championship , will be among those in attendance / he is keeping a watching brief in case he overcomes the challenges of , first , @entity211 in @entity51 , then @entity213 ’s @entity212 and goes on to face @entity175 in a unification battle			2
* @entity217 will be televised live on @entity218 on saturday night .			1
