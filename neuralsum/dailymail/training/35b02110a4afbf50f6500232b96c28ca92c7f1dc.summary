‘ it seems to me that like so many others , you both revealed a weaker side to your characters in taking advantage of an escalating situation because you thought you could get away with it and would not be caught			0
‘ you most probably also got caught up with what you , through immaturity and ill - judgement , thought was an exciting experience			0
‘ it is clear that these offences were committed as part of one of the most serious criminal enterprises which occurred during the civil disturbances which spread across the capital and beyond last august			0
