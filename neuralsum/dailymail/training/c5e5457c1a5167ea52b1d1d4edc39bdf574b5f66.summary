@entity7 , 21 , woke up with skin that was blotchy , red and itchy
it started on her face but spread to her hands and elbows
doctors said the severe eczema was *due* to the stress of her a-level exams
for years she tried antibiotics and steroid creams but nothing worked
she could n't wear make up because it was too painful and caused flare ups
became caught in *vicious* *cycle* as stress over her skin made it worse
her auntie saw a cream called @entity54 in a magazine and suggested it
the organic cream was the only thing able to cure miss @entity7 's skin
