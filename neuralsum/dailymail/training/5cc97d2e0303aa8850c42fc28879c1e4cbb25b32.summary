in today 's hearing , @entity3 ' defense will argue that police did not read him the miranda rights informing him that anything he says may be used in evidence against him			1
the prosecution will argue that their question to @entity3 before they read him the @entity18 rights was legal under a public - safety exemption			1
police say they asked him if he had an accomplice , according to @entity22			0
@entity3 is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 when he opened fire at a @entity25 screening in the @entity27 suburb of @entity28 last july @entity3 pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity for the mass murders in a crowded @entity28 movie theater during a midnight show on july 20 , 2012			1
he faces 166 counts , including murder and attempted murder			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty			0
it is the second week of hearings focused on what evidence will be submitted in @entity3 ' trial			2
some of the evidence in dispute comes from two dating websites where @entity3 set up accounts before the shootings			2
prosecutors say that in his website profiles on @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity3 asked , ' will you visit me in prison ? ' prosecutors say they plan to use that to show @entity3 knew the shootings were wrong , undercutting his insanity plea			2
according to the judge 's summary of the arguments , @entity3 ' created the @entity50 account in april 2012 and the @entity51 account just 15 days before the shooting on july 20			1
both were last accessed two days before the shooting			0
evidence ? @entity3 created a profile on a popular sex website just days before the massacre photos posted to both accounts showed @entity3 with the orange - dyed hair made infamous in his first court appearance after the shooting			1
the titles associated with @entity3 ' postings on both sites were , ' will you visit me in prison ? ' @entity3 created the profile on @entity51 on july 5 , just two weeks before the shooting and included a picture of himself with reddish , orange hair			2
@entity3 , who used the screen name classicjimbo included a cryptic message on the top of the profile which read , ' will you visit me in prison ? ' in his profile , he described himself as 6ft and single with an athletic body			2
he said he was a ' light / social drinker ' , however in the section where he 's asked if he smokes or does drugs , he answered , ' i 'd prefer not to say			0
' he also states his penis size as ' short / average '			0
clean - shaven @entity3 in a court sketch from sept 30 , left , and bearded at an earlier hearing ( right ) ' a reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware would warrant prison time , ' @entity100 district judge @entity99 's wrote			0
the judge also wrote that evidence from both dating sites could be used in the trial in relation to the identification , sanity , intent , deliberation and culpable mental state of the suspect			0
@entity99 overruled several distinct objections defense attorneys made in their attempt to have this evidence barred			0
that included objections about online dating posts ' relevance , timing and the direct connection to the suspect			0
the judge has already rejected one defense attempt to suppress the website evidence			0
bargaining : the evidence against @entity3 is so strong he may accept a plea agreement before trial lawyers for the accused have challenged the admissibility of almost all the key evidence in the case — from photos found on @entity3 ' iphone to explosives seized in his apartment to statements he made to police after his arrest			2
defense attorneys argue that investigators seized the evidence without establishing a proper legal foundation , initially entered @entity3 ' apartment without a warrant and questioned @entity3 after he asked for an attorney			1
prosecutors contend the evidence was seized properly and that their methods were justified by ongoing fears for the public 's safety even after @entity3 was arrested			1
the judge 's decision on the evidence could impact prosecutors ' ability to argue that @entity3 knew what he was doing was wrong — a key element in disproving @entity3 ' insanity plea			1
a trial is scheduled for next year .			0

@entity3 ' defense team argue police did not read him the @entity18 rights informing him what he said may be used in evidence against him
prosecution argue there is a legal exemption under public safety
