' when @entity12 and @entity49 officials scanned the boxes , they found ten containing bags of dissolved cocaine			2

' both these men had a substantial awareness of what they were doing , each had a leading role and both set to gain substantially			0
following the hearing , @entity100 , from @entity12 , said : ' these two were exceptionally callous			0
they used living creatures as a test run and then effectively as packaging for their drugs , seeing only the profits they would make			2
' @entity12 is grateful to the expert teams at @entity89 who helped us out in this very unusual case			0
' partnerships at a national and international level are vital if we are to tackle drug trafficking			0

they have a great future ahead of them , here at the @entity89 '			0
