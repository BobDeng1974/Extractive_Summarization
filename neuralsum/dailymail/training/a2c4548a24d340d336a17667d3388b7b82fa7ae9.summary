some politicians come under fire for being corrupt or incompetent , but @entity3 's new minister of public health is the first political figure to come under fire for being too fat for the job			1
@entity7 - who is @entity3 's most popular politician and was once tipped as a future premier - surprised many when it was announced she would take up the role of health minister in the centre - right coalition which has just taken office			1
the 52 - year - old , who weighs in at more than 20 stone , was not considered to be exactly setting a good example in a country where obesity is a growing health problem			2
her suitability for the role has been questioned because of her weight			1
the country is facing a growing obesity problem defiant : the politician has shrugged off the criticism , pointing to her experience as both a gp and a minister in the nation 's previous government the @entity34 charge was led by @entity35 , a @entity36 - based correspondent for @entity3 's @entity38 television station			1
in a tweet he questioned whether she would be ' credible ' in her new post			0
@entity42 , a top @entity43 tv channel , likened her to a larger - than - life figure from a @entity47 painting and said her ' obvious corpulence ' would cause ' sniggering			0
' but ms @entity49 , who practised medicine as a gp for 25 years , has shrugged off the criticism			0
merit : ms @entity7 urged her countrymen to look beyond her appearance when deciding if she was an able and effective politician ' i know i 'm not a model but you have to see what 's inside , not the packaging , ' she said			0
according to the @entity64 data from 2008 , a total of 47 per cent of the adult population in @entity3 were overweight			2
as minister for immigration in the last @entity3 government she was praised for slashing the number of asylum requests by almost half , from 27,000 per year to 15,000			2
she was unmoved by hunger strikes and sent in the police to end them and to ensure that expulsion orders were carried out .			0

@entity73 - a former gp - has *deflected* comments about her weight
some questioned her suitability for *tackling* @entity3 's obesity crisis
but the *widely* - *admired* minister says appearances mean nothing
