by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 27 august 2013 @entity1 had to wear a bicycle helmet to protect his exposed brain from injury a boy had half of his skull removed because of a simple sinus infection but did n't let it get in the way of his schoolwork			1
despite undergoing extreme surgery to halt the spread of the infection , @entity1 , nine , from @entity15 in @entity16 , still attended school and protected his vulnerable brain by wearing a bicycle helmet			1
the operation left half his brain covered only by a thin layer of skin and , as a result , he had to wear the helmet for five months			1
however , two weeks ago he had surgery to place a ceramic skull replacement over the gap			1
he is now free of the helmet and looking forward to playing sport again			0
@entity1 's initial infection was common - sinusitis causes the chambers above the nose to swell and become painful			1
it typically causes a high temperature , pain and tenderness in the face , and a blocked or runny nose			0
the majority of people take over-the - counter medications and the infection clears up on its own			0
when the condition is severe , antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone			2
however , in very rare cases - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the area surrounding the eye , the bones , the blood or the brain			2
his mother , @entity57 , and father , @entity58 , first noticed something was wrong in february when @entity1 's eyes began to droop and he suffered headaches			2
this was because his brain was beginning to swell and push against his eyes			0
his condition rapidly deteriorated and surgeons were forced to painstakingly cut away the entire left side of his skull			1
doctors ' cleaned ' his brain of infection but were concerned that potentially fatal bacteria had spread into his skull bone , so decided not to replace it after surgery			1
@entity1 underwent surgery to remove half his skull because a usually harmless sinus infection spread to the bone in his skull , and to his brain @entity1 was back on his feet within weeks , but with only his skin covering his brain he had to wear a helmet to protect his ' squidgy ' head			1
two weeks ago he went under the knife again to allow doctors to fit a new custom - made ceramic skull implant			1
@entity1 said : ' an infection went up my nose and under my skull so they had to take the skull out , and they then stitched the skin back over so you could n't see the inside			1
surprisingly @entity1 was back on his feet within weeks , but with only his skin covering his brain he had to wear a helmet to protect his ' squidgy ' head			1
two weeks ago he went under the knife again when doctors fitted a new custom - made ceramic skull implant ' at first i thought " where has it gone ? " and then my mum told me and i was really shocked			1
it was really squidgy and jelly			0
' sinusitis is inflammation of the lining of the sinuses , caused by a viral or bacterial infection			0
the sinuses are small , air - filled cavities behind the cheekbones and forehead			0
sinusitis typically causes a high temperature , pain and tenderness in the face , and a blocked or runny nose			0
it is a common , usually harmless , condition and can affect people of any age complications of sinusitis are more common in children than in adults			0
if a child has sinusitis and swelling around the cheekbone or eyelid , it may be a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue or an infection of the tissue surrounding the eye			2
when the condition is severe , antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone			2
however , in very rare cases - about one in 10,000 - infection can spread to the area surrounding the eye , the bones , the blood or the brain			2
this can be fatal unless treated quickly			0
he added : ' when the skull was n't there it was like a blancmange , because it was all squidgy , and there was only fluid there , and it was n't symmetrical like heads sould be			2
' @entity1 was on holiday with his parents , and brother @entity164 , 14 , in february , when he developed a temperature			1
surgeons at the @entity168 in @entity169 discovered an infection had moved from his sinuses to his brain and was putting pressure on his skull			1
he was rushed into surgery and doctors worked against the clock to catch the infection before it permanently damaged his brain			1
he was in an induced coma for three days , but after a few weeks in bed he was back on his feet			0
his mother said : ' he went back to school and he could do anything apart from sport			0
' he had to wear his protective helmet right up until two weeks ago			0
' he then underwent surgery to have a " ceramic " skull replacement fitted			1
the material , which is similar in tecture to coral , is porous			0
' this means that as @entity195 â€™s skull grows it will fuse with the synthetic bone , healing over the hole			2
' because the skull implant will be able to grow with @entity195 , it will not restrict the growth of his brain and affect his development			2
' he was really good about it and got used to it			0
his attitude and his positive approach over the last few months has been a lesson to us all really			0
' @entity1 underwent surgery to have a ' ceramic ' skull replacement fitted ( mock up of how much was removed )			1
the material , which is similar in texture to coral , is porous			0
this means that as @entity1 skull grows it will fuse with the synthetic bone , healing over the hole surgeons believe it is the first time the operation has been carried out in the @entity224 in response to an infection , instead of trauma			1
they hope it will eventually fuse with his remaining bits of skull			0
neurosurgeon dr @entity231 said : ' @entity195 's case is , i think , the first case in this country to use this material			0

@entity1 , from @entity16 , developed sinusitis that spread to his brain
surgeons ' cleaned ' his brain but were concerned his skull remained infected so left one side of his brain without bone covering it
because this left only a thin layer of skin over his brain , he wore a bicycle helmet to *prevent* his ' squidgy head ' being knocked and damaged
he wore the hat for five months until he underwent surgery to fit a ceramic skull replacement over the hole
