by @entity0 notorious villains : now the story of @entity3 and @entity4 is being turned into a film by @entity7 - winning writer , @entity6 they were gangland villains of the highest order , violent thugs who terrified @entity12 's @entity11 as they committed a string of robberies , arsons , assaults and murders			1
now the story of @entity3 and @entity4 is to be told in a new biopic written and directed by @entity7 - winning @entity20 writer , @entity6			1
and the twin brothers are to be played by one actor , @entity12 - born @entity22 , 36 , who will indicate his change between brothers by donning glasses when he 's playing @entity3			1
filming for the movie , which is still in development , began in @entity28 this week , and production is expected to start later this year			0
with the working title of legend , the biopic is expected to focus on the @entity4 ' organised reign of crime and terror in the @entity12 underworld of the 1950s and 1960s			1
and mr @entity6 will have plenty of material			0
the brothers , who were born in @entity40 , east @entity12 , in 1933 , began their life of violence young			2
at nine , they had such a violent fight that @entity3 , the younger by ten minutes , almost died from his head injury			2
a decade later , and already known for their violence and thuggishness , they walked out of national service , pausing only to punch the corporal who tried to stop them , leaving him seriously injured			0
they were arrested and sent back to the @entity53 , but went awol again , only to assault a policeman who tried to arrest them , which landed them in the @entity59 , as some of the last prisoners ever to be detained there , followed by a string of other prisons and then a dishonourable discharge from the @entity53			0
crime took the thuggish brothers away from what could have been a promising future in boxing , and they devoted their lives to their gang , known as @entity73 , while attempting a series of business ventures			1
the first of these was a club called @entity78 off @entity79 , which had an uninviting exterior but inside was a glamorous and decadent nightclub , overseen by the sharp - suited brothers			0
despite their smooth appearances , however , the brothers were involved in a life of appalling crime , running protection rackets , as well as staging hijacks and armed robberies			2
@entity3 , who was considered the more violent of the two , was imprisoned for @entity91 in 1957 , and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during his jail term			2
he was also publicly bisexual , an unusual thing to admit at the time , and something his brother found hard to come to terms with			0
thugs : the @entity4 , pictured at home in 1966 after being quizzed by police about the murder of @entity103 @entity12 - born actor @entity22 , 36 , will wear thick glasses to play @entity3 , left , taking them off for @entity4 , right terrifying : the brothers , born in 1933 , led a reign of terror across @entity12 until they were jailed in 1968 @entity4 was imprisoned two years later , but by 1960 both were out of prison and had become almost celebrities , socialising with stars such as @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , as well as well as eminent politicians including @entity116 , with whom @entity3 had an affair			1
in 1965 , @entity4 married @entity118 , but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967 , apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that @entity3 murdered her			1
the police frequently investigated the twins ' activities , but with the @entity11 living in fear of the notorious twins , no - one dared testify against them , so their misdemeanours often went unchallenged			0
the firm then largely consisted of the brothers , their cousin , @entity130 , and at least 13 others , including brothers @entity132 and @entity134			0
in 1966 , the @entity4 helped @entity135 , also known as @entity136 , escape from @entity138 , and put him up at a friend 's flat in @entity140			0
he subsequently disappeared , and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder , a later book claimed that he had been shot			0
quite a story : filming for the biopic , written and directed by @entity6 , started in @entity28 this week their story was told in the 1990 @entity152 film , @entity4 , in which @entity146 and @entity147 played the brothers the same year , @entity3 shot @entity103 dead in the @entity155 pub in @entity156			1
@entity157 , an associate of @entity12 gang , the @entity160 , is said to have remarked : ' well look who 's here ' just before he was shot			2
and in 1967 , @entity4 murdered former gang member @entity162 ' the @entity163 in @entity164 , stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife , twisting the knife as @entity169 lay dying			2
the brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968 , when they and several members of @entity73 were arrested , and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years			1
the judge , mr justice @entity178 , told them : ' in my view , society has earned a rest from your activities			0
' they were allowed out of prison for their mother 's funeral in 1982 , but @entity3 died in @entity190 , aged 61 in 1995 , and @entity4 , died at 66 , in 2000 , a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave			1
film industry executives have shown great interest in the film about the @entity4 , with buyers hailing the script as ' one of the best ' they 'd come across			0
the @entity4 ' story was previously told in the 1990 @entity152 film , @entity4 , with real life brothers @entity147 and @entity201 playing the title roles .			1

the @entity4 ran a terrifying *network* of organised crime in the 1950s and 60s
@entity208 brothers committed robberies , arsons , assaults and murders in @entity12
with their gang of thuggish villains , @entity73 , they dominated the @entity11
notorious @entity4 murders included @entity103 and @entity162 ' the @entity219
both were finally sentenced to life in jail in may 1968 , and @entity3 died there
@entity4 died in 2000 , five years after his brother , out on compassionate leave
now their story is to become a film , by @entity7 winning writer , @entity6
@entity152 actor @entity22 , 36 , will play both @entity4 , wearing glasses for @entity3
