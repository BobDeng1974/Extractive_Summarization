by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 17 august 2013 a flight recorder revealed that pilots of a @entity5 cargo jet that crashed short of a runway at @entity8 's airport received warnings about their rate of descent seconds before impact , investigators said friday			1
@entity14 member @entity13 told reporters during a briefing that a recorder captured the first of two audible warnings in the cockpit 16 seconds before the sound of an impact , either with trees or the ground			1
the warnings indicated the @entity26 cargo plane was descending at a rate outside normal parameters given its altitude , @entity13 said , but investigators have n't made any determination on the actual cause of the crash into an @entity35 hillside			2
there is a hill and some trees at one end which can make it ' tricky ' for larger jets obstacles : at the start of runway 18 at @entity8 airport lay a number of trees and also a hill that can make landing a large plane ' tricky ' ' we have n't ruled anything in , have n't ruled anything out , ' he said			1
the aircraft went down less than a mile from the end of @entity81 at @entity8 's airport before dawn wednesday			2
@entity5 has identified the victims of the crash as capt. @entity86 , 58 , of @entity87 , @entity88 , and first officer @entity89 , 37 , of @entity90 , @entity91			0
investigation : @entity14 board member and spokesman @entity13 during grid search of crash site at a field north of the site at @entity8 landing on the runway can be tricky for pilots , an expert said , particularly those flying big jets like the twin - engine @entity5 cargo carrier			1
@entity13 said the plane was being flown by the captain — who had 8,600 hours of flight experience , including 3,200 hours in an @entity26 — but investigators do n't know whether @entity86 or @entity89 had ever before landed on runway 18			1
' we 're going to do our best to find out , ' he said			0
@entity13 said investigators will analyze the airplane 's weight to determine whether it should have attempted a landing on the runway , the shorter of two runways at @entity8			1
with a large hill and trees at one end , the runway lacks the electronics for a full instrument landing			2
that forces pilots to make key judgments about altitude while aiming a descending aircraft at a runway that 's 5,000 feet shorter than the airport 's main runway , which was closed for maintenance work at the time of the crash			1
some pilots simply avoid landing on runway 18 when possible , said veteran commercial pilot @entity136			1
' when i heard they were using @entity81 18 it caught my attention because of that hill , ' said @entity136			0
' it 's sad , but it did n't surprise me			0
' @entity136 , a retired @entity143 captain , is now chief executive of @entity144 , a firm based in @entity146			0
black box found : @entity14 investigators work around the tail section of the @entity5 cargo plane resting place : a wooden cross by a church is shown near the wreckage of a @entity5 @entity26 cargo plane that crashed on the north side of the @entity8 points of interest : this map shows the locations where the crash occured the @entity14 previously said a preliminary investigation did n't reveal any evidence of engine failure before the plane struck trees about one mile away from the end of the runway			1
it crashed into the bottom of a hill less than a quarter mile after hitting the trees			0
the @entity26 , which weighs about 172,700 pounds when empty , was at the end of a 45 - minute flight from @entity175 , @entity176 , to @entity8 when it went down			2
a flight summary from flightaware.com , which tracks airplanes , shows the aircraft made a descent in steps , which @entity136 said is a ' dive and drive ' method common on runways with the same navigational guidance as @entity81			0
@entity13 said the aircraft went down during its first landing attempt			0
@entity13 said investigators have not found any problems with the runway 's lights or navigation system , which typically provides pilots with information about their lateral position but not about their altitude , unlike those on runways where pilots can land using only instruments			2
destroyed : @entity14 ( @entity14 ) investigators examine debris of a @entity205 cargo plane after it crashed on approach at @entity8 in @entity35 crushed : part of what appears to be one of the airplane 's engines is caked in dirt blaze : flames rise from a @entity5 @entity26 cargo plane which crashed near the airport in @entity8 , @entity35 on wednesday @entity217 records from the morning of the crash show the plane would have descended through overcast conditions to only a few clouds at 1,100 feet			1
within seconds after the plane hit a tree and at least one turbine sucked in wood , the twin - engine plane crashed			2
it hit the base of that large hill mentioned by @entity136 , who said he had landed on runway 18 about a half - dozen times , including on some flights as a cargo pilot			1
located near the southern tip of the @entity236 foothills , @entity8 's airport is nestled in a low spot between @entity238 to the south and hills that lie at the northern end of @entity81 , which is 7,000 feet long			1
the main runway is 12,000 feet long and runs east and west , meaning pilots do n't have to negotiate the rough terrain			1
the @entity14 said the longer runway was closed for maintenance work on its lights early wednesday , leaving the shorter runway as the only path to the ground			2
runway 18 is an approved runway with a valid approach , @entity136 said			1
' it is definitely legal , but it i had a choice i 'd use another runway first , ' he said			0
tragic : fire crews investigate where a @entity5 cargo plane lies on a hill at @entity8 after crashing on approach a postal inspector officer looks over the debris of an @entity5 @entity26 cargo plane after it crashed on approach in the early hours of wednesday fatal crash : two pilots died when the plane went down in the early hours of wednesday disaster : what appears to be parcels are strewn across a field after a @entity5 cargo plane came down shortly before dawn in @entity35 a key task for investigators will be determining why the @entity5 jet was low enough to hit trees			1
the impact sheared off pieces of the aircraft and sent them crashing onto two homes along with large pieces of limbs			0
@entity288 , 17 , said he witnessed the crash while getting ready for work before dawn			0
@entity288 , who lives with relatives across the street from the crash site , said it was unusual to see such a large aircraft attempting to land on the runway			0
' i saw the sky turn orange and i looked up and i saw it in the air on fire , ' @entity288 said			0
' i watched it hit the ground and dirt flew up			0
this whole area just shook			0
' @entity136 said the flames could have been shooting from the plane after it struck the trees .			0
