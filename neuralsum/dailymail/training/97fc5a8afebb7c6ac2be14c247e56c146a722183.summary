first team coach @entity5 will take caretaker charge , starting with saturday 's visit to @entity9 leaders @entity10			1
@entity1 are currently seventh in the table - three points off the play - off places - and were knocked out of the @entity14 at @entity16 @entity15 on saturday			1
@entity0 has resigned as @entity1 manager with immediate effect and will take a break from football @entity1 were beaten 2 - 0 at @entity15 in the @entity14 on saturday , with @entity20 ( left ) on target played 32 won 11 drawn 8 lost 13 win ratio 34.38 a statement released on the club website on monday read : ' @entity1 can confirm @entity0 has resigned as manager with immediate effect			1
' the process of appointing a new manager to take the club forward is already underway			2
' meanwhile , first team coach @entity5 will take charge of team matters until the new manager is confirmed			1
' former canary winger and successful youth team coach @entity0 will take a break from the game before returning to work for the club in july , in a role to be confirmed at a later date			1
@entity5 will take temporary charge after @entity0 resigned as manager with immediate effect ' @entity0 was appointed to the first team manager ’s position on a full - time basis in may 2014 after a brief five - game spell as caretaker at the end of the 2013 - 14 @entity47 campaign			1
' following the @entity9 defeat at @entity49 on december 28 , the @entity1 currently sit seventh in the league table			1
after saturday ’s @entity14 third round exit at the hands of @entity15 , @entity0 met for discussions with the @entity54 and agreed to resign			1
' @entity0 commented : ' i firmly believe that we are still on course for a crack at promotion back to the @entity47			2
that is where this club belongs			0
it was an awfully long way to travel for such a dismally poor performance			0
1,200 @entity1 fans made the 470 - mile round trip to @entity15 for saturday 's @entity14 third round tie and their reward was an abject display that left @entity0 searching for words			1
' i can only apologise to the fans			0
they saw nothing and they have nothing to go back with positive			0
you always look for something to cling to			0
today we have n't got anywhere near that , ' the manager said			0
the past couple of weeks have summed up the inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies of @entity1 's season			2
those inconsistencies have now led to @entity0 handing in his resignation			2
one win in 10 championship matches during october and november saw the @entity1 knocked off their perch , having looked good for an immediate @entity47 return initially			1
but then , just in time for @entity93 , some much - needed cheer as wins over @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , as well as a stirring comeback at promotion - chasing @entity100 , saw them rise from 11th to 7th and back into play - off contention			0
even more encouragingly , the goals were starting to flow again			0
there had been many games when @entity1 would create up to 20 chances , and take just a couple			2
but they smacked five past @entity97 and hit @entity98 for six			0
it coincided with the arrival of former @entity111 assistant manager @entity5 and the early signs were this could be an effective partnership			1
following that , though , came another slump - the one that proved fatal for @entity0			2
they were lacklustre in a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity49 and even worse against @entity15			2
@entity0 , the genial and loyal club servant who played 206 times on the wing during his playing day and then looked after the fledglings in the academy , arrived in april with an impossible task			1
replacing @entity124 , @entity0 really had to claim full points from a final batch of fixtures against @entity128 , @entity111 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
in the end , they gained just one and went down			0
but , handed the reins permanently in may , he managed to retain quite a few members of their @entity47 squad and brought in @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , among others			0
just over halfway through the season , though , it 's all come to a screeching halt for @entity0 and it remains to be seen which @entity1 turns up next			1
first team coach @entity5 will take temporary charge , starting with saturday 's trip to @entity10 ' however , i feel it is in the best interests of the team that an immediate change is made in order to ensure a positive impact on results			1
' it goes without saying that i sincerely hope the team achieves success this season and i would like to say a huge thank you to the supporters who have backed me during my tenure as manager			0
' the statement continued : ' the club would like to thank @entity0 for his hard work and dedication during his time as manager and over many years as a player and coach			1
everybody at @entity1 looks forward to working with him again when he returns in the summer			0
' the club will not be commenting any further at this time			0
' @entity0 took over from @entity124 for the final five matches of last season but was unable to keep the team in the @entity47			1
@entity1 had appeared to be rediscovering their best form before @entity93 but things soon unravelled he was given the role permanently at the end of the season and things initially started well in the @entity9 , with the @entity1 retaining much of their squad and topping the table at one point			1
but they dropped off the automatic promotion pace - to the growing frustration of fans - after a run of one win in 10 championship games			0
however , a four - game unbeaten run in december , including free - scoring wins over @entity97 and @entity98 led many to believe they had turned the corner			0
they also came from two goals down to draw at promotion - chasing @entity100			0
but things unravelled again after @entity93 , with a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity49 in the league followed by a disappointing 2 - 0 loss at @entity15 on saturday			2
@entity1 are currently seventh in the @entity9 table , three points off the play - offs			2
