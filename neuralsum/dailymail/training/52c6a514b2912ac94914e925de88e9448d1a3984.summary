spectators at the trial of @entity14 — the highest - ranking @entity10 figure to face trial on @entity7 soil since the attacks — will pass through a metal detector before entering a @entity21 courtroom where prosecutors will try to prove to an anonymous jury that the one - time terror network spokesman tried to rally others to kill @entity7			1
prosecutors say they plan to show jurors during their opening statement a picture of @entity14 seated with @entity3 and other @entity10 leaders on the day after sept. 11 , 2001 , as they make statements about the attacks			1

' the @entity7 must know that the storm of airplanes will not stop , @entity52 willing , and there are thousands of young people who are as keen about death as @entity7 are about life , ' @entity14 said in an oct. 9 , 2001 , speech			2
in one widely circulated propaganda video , @entity14 can be seen sitting with @entity3 and current @entity10 leader @entity60 against a rocky backdrop			2
defense lawyers for the balding and bearded defendant are offering some surprises in the case , including an assertion last week that some of the government 's evidence relates to a detainee at @entity71 with a similar name to @entity14 rather than to the defendant who has pleaded not guilty			1
@entity7 district judge @entity74 on friday called the mistaken identity claim ' utterly meritless '			2
his attorneys are also trying to enlist help from professed 9/11 mastermind @entity78 to bolster the case for acquittal , though it has n't come fast enough for them to gain permission from @entity82 for @entity78 to testify , perhaps through a video link to @entity71			2
if convicted , @entity14 could face life in prison			0
@entity14 is married to @entity3 's eldest daughter , @entity86 , one of nearly two dozen children @entity3 was believed to have fathered before he was killed in @entity88 by @entity7 special forces in 2011 defense attorneys said friday that @entity78 had provided a 14 - page response to written questions , but his lawyer was refusing to turn it over unless there was a guarantee that military lawyers at @entity71 would n't review it			1
the judge refused to consider the matter further			0
the @entity101 - born defendant was flown to the @entity7 a year ago from @entity102 , where he was captured as he headed to @entity101 , which had revoked his citizenship after the sept. 11 attacks			2
in an affidavit filed last year as he tried to suppress a 22 - page statement he made to authorities , @entity14 said he left @entity108 in 2002 and entered @entity109 , where he was arrested and held in prisons and interrogated extensively			0
@entity14 said he was released from @entity109 custody on jan. 11 , 2013 , when he entered @entity112 , where he was detained and interrogated before his feb. 28 , 2013 , release			0
he said he was heading home to @entity101 on a plane to see family when the flight landed instead in @entity118 , @entity102 , where he was handcuffed and turned over to @entity7 authorities			0
@entity14 is married to @entity3 's eldest daughter , @entity86 , one of nearly two dozen children @entity3 was believed to have fathered before he was killed in @entity88 by @entity7 special forces in 2011			1

@entity14 is accused of conspiring to kill @entity7 in his role as @entity10 's mouthpiece after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks when he was brought to the @entity7 for trial , some criticized the move , saying @entity10 leaders should not receive the protections offered by a civil court trial			1
but numerous pre-trial hearings have gone on without a hitch in a courthouse that has featured more than a half dozen major @entity10 - related terrorism trials over the last two decades stemming from the 1993 @entity49 bombing , a 1993 plot to blow up @entity38 landmarks including the @entity140 , the deadly 1998 bombings of two @entity7 embassies in @entity143 and a plot to blow up a dozen @entity7 airliners over the @entity146 in 1995			0
attorney general @entity147 announced in november 2009 that @entity78 would be tried in federal court in @entity38 in the sept. 11 attacks , but the decision was reversed months later after city officials complained that the trial would impose large security costs on the city and be disruptive to the local economy .			0
