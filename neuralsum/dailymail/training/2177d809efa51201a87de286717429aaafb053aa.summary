it 's a video guaranteed to send shivers down your spine : a man attempts to tightrope walk , or ' highline ' between two ice shelves , without a safety harness or net , the first time that this will ever have been achieved			1
the video footage shows @entity13 @entity12 attempting the first ever crevasse highline in @entity16 's famous @entity15			2
it 's just one of new online short film series directed by @entity19 which shows three extreme athletes , for whom risk and adventure is a way of life , in a range of death defying situations			1
highlining over an icy crevasse without a safety harness or net , skiing down an almost vertical mountainside and conquering the highest alpine peaks , all three men push themselves to the limit in the name of adventure			1
@entity12 is one athlete who is clearly not afraid of the unknown			2
installing a line between two ice walls , he tries to cross the line unattached - balancing precariously above the gaping opening into the bottomless depths of the @entity76 glacier			1
@entity12 confronts fear and comes out the other side triumphant			2
high in the air with only a rope between himself and oblivion , composure is vital or an icy death awaits			1
it 's literally a heart in the mouth moment as @entity87 starts to wobble halfway across , lose his balance and slip			2
undeterred , @entity89 climbs back onto the highwire and continues his crossing without any safety harness nearly there : @entity89 continues across the sheer drop with only an icy crevass beneath him , to finish triumphant but he manages to catch hold of the wire , where he dangles high above the crevasse , then turning himself upsidedown and hanging by his feet until he regains his composure			1
@entity87 gets back onto the rope and finishes his death defying crossing , giving high fives to the cameraman on the other side of the crevasse as he steps to safety			1
joining highliner @entity12 in the series of three videos are steep skier @entity113 and mountaineer @entity114 in the @entity115			0
growing up in the mountains of @entity16 , skier @entity113 spends his spare time scoping out new descents and exploring new lines			0
sheer courage : steep - skier @entity113 prepares to begin the ascent of an almost vertical mountain covered with precipitous rocks as well as snow the final ascent : mountaineer @entity114 reaches the tope of a towering granite peak on @entity130 his technique of ' dry skiing ' alllows him to reach places with his skis on , where most would n't even venture			0
setting off from the @entity136 , he enters into a labyrinth of couloirs and rocky dead ends hoping to find a way through to the untouched powder fields beyond			0
meanwhile @entity114 's passion is climbing mountains			0
already halfway through the training to become a high mountain guide , he takes his twin brother into the towering granite peaks of the @entity130 massif to share his love for climbing			0
with a quick lesson on belay technique , @entity114 sets off on a highly technical rock climbing pitch - hoping his brother will remember what to do if he falls			0
the three videos commissioned by @entity157 are linked by the comapny 's strapline , ' when you ’re clinging to the side of a mountain the last thing you want to think about is an awkward itch ! '			0
