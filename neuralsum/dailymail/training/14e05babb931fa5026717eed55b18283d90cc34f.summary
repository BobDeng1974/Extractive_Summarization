by @entity0 published : 15:58 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 19:13 est , 11 may 2013 a set of portraits drawn by one of the key figures in the @entity5 has been discovered – 50 years after they were ‘ disposed of ’			1
the pictures were drawn by @entity7 , the ‘ fixer ’ in the 1960s scandal who was accused of introducing minister of war @entity11 to showgirl @entity13			1
the pair enjoyed an illicit affair but after @entity13 was subsequently discovered to be sleeping with @entity18 naval attaché @entity16 , @entity11 was forced to resign from the @entity19 and @entity7 was prosecuted for living off the immoral earnings of prostitution			1
portraits : @entity13 has identified the picture on the left as a portrait of her			1
the right portrait is said to be of @entity27			0
the pictures were drawn by @entity7 , the ‘ fixer ’ in the 1960s scandal leaving court : @entity13 ( right ) with @entity27 ( left ) leaving the @entity32 when @entity7 was on trial facing vice charges lawyers acting for @entity7 , who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial , considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view			1
but the artworks , which are reproduced today for the very first time , survived because the clerk of the now - defunct law firm @entity43 secretly gave them to one of his best friends for safe keeping			1
the distinctive pencil , chalk and charcoal sketches include portraits of 14 sitters , including @entity13 and @entity16			1
@entity13 , who has studied the portraits on behalf of @entity53 , last night identified a picture of a young woman with her hair in a bun as a portrait of her			1
other sitters are believed to include @entity60 and @entity27 , a friend of both @entity7 and @entity13 who had a string of affairs with high - profile figures of the day			1
@entity7 , who met many of his portrait subjects through his work as a high society osteopath , was instrumental in introducing some of the key players in the controversy to each other and was at the infamous party at @entity75 ’s @entity74 estate where @entity13 , who was just 19 at the time , met @entity11			1
all smiles : @entity7 with @entity13 in 1963 ( left ) and one of his drawings , featuring a mystery model ( right ) scandal : mr @entity7 , the ‘ fixer ’ in the 1960s scandal , was accused of introducing minister of war @entity11 ( left ) to showgirl @entity13 ( right ) a besotted @entity11 , who was then married to actress @entity84 , had no idea @entity13 was also sleeping with @entity16			1
@entity7 , who prior to the scandal had been one of the best connected people in @entity88 and counted prince @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 among his friends , quickly became the scapegoat for the affair			1
he took an overdose on the day before his trial ended			0
he was still in a coma on july 31 when the jury found him guilty and he died on august 3 , 1963			0
it is believed the portraits may have been destined for an exhibition at the now - defunct @entity103 in @entity88 ’s @entity104			2
artist : lawyers acting for @entity7 ( pictured ) , who committed suicide in 1963 while on trial , considered the portraits sensitive and gave orders for them to be removed from public view at the time of his trial , @entity7 was represented by flamboyant celebrity lawyer @entity113			1
it is believed that @entity113 ordered his clerk @entity115 to get rid of the portraits			1
but @entity115 instead decided to give the works to his friend @entity118 , an avid art collector			2
@entity118 died in 1988 but his family held on to the sketches			0
his daughter @entity121 said : ‘ @entity115 decided to get rid of the sketches but did it in his own way			0
he knew my father would look after them			0
’ @entity127 , who wrote the book @entity128 about the @entity5 , said : ‘ it is quite likely these pictures were among those which were to be shown at the @entity103 exhibition			0
’ by @entity135 talented : @entity7 's illustrations had attracted the attention of prime minister @entity91 , who gave unique permission for @entity7 to draw mps in session in the commons on a spring evening in 1960 , i went to dinner at a small nightclub called @entity146 in @entity147 , one of a tangle of narrow thoroughfares between @entity151 and @entity152 in @entity88			1
the club had a semi-circular stage , around the perimeter of which hung a red curtain			0
in front of the stage were half a dozen easels , with paper and crayons			0
the curtain would draw back to reveal a nude sitter in a chair			0
the club was managed by a tiny model , @entity167 , who tried to increase her height with a beehive hairdo and stiletto heels			0
on this particular evening , there was only one man sitting at an easel , whose portrait of the model was remarkably accurate			0
i commented on it to @entity167			0
‘ oh , that ’s @entity7 ; he ’s getting quite well known as an artist			1
would you like to meet him ? ’ ‘ yes please			0
’ she fetched him and , after the introduction , left us to sit down over a drink			0
@entity7 had hair brushed straight back , a soft voice and great charm			1
his talent as an osteopath had brought him patients from the upper reaches of society			0
his illustrations had attracted the attention of prime minister @entity91 , who as a consequence gave unique permission for @entity7 to draw mps in session in the @entity141			1
@entity7 and i had dinner and became friends , often meeting for coffee			1
when a distinguished journalist of the day , @entity203 , needed an osteopath to review a chapter of a new book on homeopathy he was writing , i suggested @entity7			2
‘ i ’ve never heard of him , but do bring him round for lunch			0
’ the three of us had an omelette and a flagon of burgundy , and @entity7 took away the chapter for checking			2
not long afterwards , he invited me to the first night of an exhibition of his drawings at the @entity219 in @entity220 , mounted as a reward after he healed the neck of one of the brothers which had been broken in a riding accident			0
among the sitters attending the exhibition i remember @entity229 , who had had a prolonged affair with @entity231 , the prime minister ’s wife ; @entity233 , @entity235 ’s son - in - law and secretary of state for defence ; and the @entity237 mp for @entity238 , @entity239			2
all of them greeted @entity7 as a friend , the aloof @entity233 putting an arm round him			1
affair : @entity11 , the newly - appointed secretary of state for war at the @entity245 before the scandal of his affair with call - girl @entity13 then the @entity5 hit the headlines , and they , together with the rest of @entity7 ’s society ‘ friends ’ , were gone , the shelves in his consultancy empty of invitations			1
@entity203 , @entity7 and i had one more lunch together , at a restaurant in @entity259			2
it was obvious that ‘ @entity265 ’ @entity261 , the home secretary , was intent on framing @entity7 as a pimp and a @entity18 spy			2
‘ @entity7 , what really happened ? i ’ll guarantee you any organ of communication – the @entity270 , @entity271 , the @entity272 – to put your side of the case			2
’ @entity7 , however , had become a fantasist			2
‘ dear boy , @entity277 ’s a brothel and @entity280 ’s the madame			0
i ’m acting as liaison between @entity280 , @entity283 and @entity284 in the cause of peace			0
’ he chuckled ; @entity203 shrugged in despair			0
there was now no way to cleanse the smears , no way to win back any social status and no way to deflect the inevitable			0
three days after our final lunch , @entity7 was arrested , and six weeks later died by his own hand .			2
