by @entity0 the family of a lost @entity3 pilot whose plane was discovered in the desert 70 years after crashing feel ' let down ' when they were told human remains found close by were n't his			1
relatives of @entity10 have been holding out hope that bones located three miles from the perfectly - preserved @entity14 plane in the @entity15 are those of the airman			1
but after months of waiting and receiving mixed messages from the @entity18 , they have now been told that it is not possible to extract @entity20 from the remains			1
the news has been met with frustration by flight sergeant @entity10 's nephew , @entity24 , who had been about to fly to @entity25 to provide a comparative dna sample			1
scroll down to see the wreckage discovery scene : mysterious disappearance : flight sergeant @entity10 crashed in the desert in 1942 , and his plane was only uncovered last year mounting evidence : the twelve bones were found three miles found the plane , along with a piece of parachute , keyfob and metal button with 1939 on it bid for survival : the @entity41 was found perfectly preserved and someone had apparently tried to build a shelter beside it but the apparent inability to take @entity20 from the bones has been met with doubt by four forensic pathologists who have become involved in the case			1
they now plan to travel to @entity51 and examine the bones for themselves to give mr @entity24 and his family a definitive answer			2
after the bones were found last year , the family was initially told by the @entity18 that they were far too old to have been those of the lost airman			1
it then emerged that this ruling was based on a flippant remark made by a member of the @entity25 authorities and the remains had n't been examined at all			0
mr @entity24 , 62 , was then invited to supply a dna sample only for the bones to now be written off			2
he and the forensic pathologists are demanding to know how authentic the tests have been up until now and more details about the circumstances of the examinations			0
mr @entity24 , from @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , said : ' i am a little bit appalled about how all of this has been handled			0
all the information that i have received since these bones were discovered last june has been misleading and vague			0
' at first i was told the bones were 400 - years - old but information was on the back of a conversation about how more often than not bones in the desert were that age			1
' then it was arranged that i would fly to @entity51 and give a dna sample to the @entity25 so they could compare it with dna from the bones			2
' now i have received a call from the @entity18 to say that the @entity25 authorities have done the tests and the bones are n't good enough to get a dna profile from			2
' i 'm no expert but is it not possible to get dna from a dinosaur bone ? the people who found @entity99 were able to get a dna sample from his bones and they were over 600 years old			2
poignant : flight sergeant @entity104 in his @entity14 uniform aged 24 , just days before he went missing ready for combat : flt sgt @entity10 proudly looks down from the cockpit of his @entity107 ' i am very disappointed with all of this and ca n't help feel let down			1
@entity10 was a serving his country and was out there doing his bit			2
if these remains are his he should be treated properly and given a proper burial			0
' ft sgt @entity10 , 24 , of the @entity114 , had been flying a @entity41 plane between two @entity117 bases in @entity25 during the north @entity119 campaign when he disappeared			2
family memories : @entity121 is the nephew of flt sgt @entity10 nothing was ever seen of him or his plane again until 12 months ago when a team of @entity126 oil exploration workers stumbled upon the perfectly - preserved aircraft			1
there was evidence to suggest ft sgt @entity10 survived the crash as a makeshift shelter had been made using his parachute outside of the plane			1
it is thought he died while making a futile attempt to walk out of the desert			0
a month later a team of historians from @entity139 unearthed 12 human bones close to an outcrop of rocks about three miles from the plane			1
a piece of torn parachute was found close to the remains along with a keychain fob with the number 61 on it			1
a metal button dated 1939 was also recovered nearby			1
dr @entity151 , an independent forensic anatomist who has worked at the @entity152 and the @entity153 in @entity154 , is doubtful of the latest development			0
he said : ' it is quite inconceivable and i can not accept that is true			0
' i have got dna samples from bones far older than 70 years before			0
@entity20 has been extracted from 60 million - year - old dinosaurs in the @entity163 desert before			0
i am one of four forensic pathologists hoping to go out there to find out the truth			0
' a spokesman for the @entity18 said : ' the @entity25 medical research authorities have tested some bones and have come back and said it is not possible for a dna sample to be extracted from them			0
' we have informed @entity10 family accordingly			2
' the last known whereabouts of the @entity41 plane was in a storage crater in @entity177			0
the @entity178 at @entity179 has been in negotiations with the relevant @entity25 authorities to have the aircraft returned to @entity117 but it is not known how far that has progressed			0
@entity184 sentinel : a kittyhawk in @entity187 colours in flight at @entity189 in @entity190 time capsule : aside from the damage it sustained during impact , the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the @entity15 chance discovery : the single - seater aircraft was found by a @entity126 oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in @entity25 intact : most of the plane 's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the @entity25 military for safety reasons @entity3 weaponry : the machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane			1
it appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert bullet holes : the @entity41 appears to have been shot at ( left ) , while its broken propeller lays nearby ( right )			0
historians have described the find as the ' aviation equivalent of @entity226 ' well - preserved : the @entity41 's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage			2
the radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane at the controls : the plane 's cockpit , but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap unseen and untouched : equipment and controls from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site			0
the plane is still in very good condition heading home : the @entity178 at @entity179 , north @entity254 , has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future sign of the time : the @entity263 's factory stamp ( left ) and gun loading instruction panel ( right )			0
however , some locals see the aircraft as a piece of junk signs of survival : flight sergeant @entity10 's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage remote : the crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town			1
no human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot 's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane in flight : ft sgt @entity10 and another airman were tasked with flying two damaged @entity289 planes ( like this one ) from one @entity117 airbase in northern @entity25 to another for repair			1

the 12 human bones were found on some rocks three miles from the wreckage
a piece of parachute and a metal button dated 1939 were found nearby
flight sergeant @entity10 crashed at the spot in 1942 , and is thought to have wandered off into the desert
the perfectly preserved plane was found earlier this year by @entity126 oil exploration workers
but after months of waiting , his family have been told it is not possible to extract dna from the remains
