by @entity0 ponies , @entity2 and enough handbags to make @entity5 blush : no , these are n't the contents of @entity7 but some of the many gifts bestowed on 12 - year - old @entity9			1
like @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity12 , and her siblings @entity15 , seven and @entity16 , 14 , are given everything they could possibly dream of by doting parents , @entity20 and @entity21 , both 33			1
' i like labels : @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , ' reveals the 12 - year - old , who lives with her family in @entity30 , of her lavish wardrobe			1
' i do n't do @entity32 ! ' expensive tastes : @entity9 says she wo n't wear @entity32 and only likes @entity26 and @entity36 clothes now junior pageant queen @entity12 and her two siblings are to appear on new @entity40 documentary , the 12 year @entity42 and @entity41			1
in it , she shows off her favourite clothes , most of which are by @entity36 and @entity26 , as well as her pony , which costs her parents £ 2,000 a year to maintain			1
but while @entity12 and her penchant for expensive clothes might sound like most parent 's worst nightmare , her mother @entity20 reveals that @entity12 is exactly what she hoped she 'd be and says she has dressed her in designer gear since birth			1
' i had my kids young and i felt like if i dressed them in designer gear then people would think i was doing an alright job , ' she admits			0
unsurprisingly , @entity12 's demands have grown increasingly lavish - and that 's before you get to her impressively large allowance			2
scary : if @entity12 does n't get what she wants , she gives her father what she calls ' @entity70 ' ' i 've already had £ 150 this week and it ’s only tuesday ' smirks the 12 - year - old , ' if i ask @entity73 for something and do n't get a yes straight away i give him " @entity70 "			1
' and it seems the threat of getting ' @entity70 ' is enough to persuade father @entity21 to part with just about any sum of money @entity12 cares to name			1
' i say : " oh , @entity73 , pleeease ? " and he goes : " ok , how much do you want ? " and i go : " can i have £ 300 ? " each time i go higher			1
' but of all the presents @entity12 has been given , the most expensive was her pony - which even her mother said gave her pause for thought			1
' we were n't 100 per cent on the horse because it costs £ 2,000 a year to take care of and we said no to start but @entity12 really proved herself , ' says @entity20			1
' she gave up her weekends and mucked out the horse and @entity21 enjoys the horse too so everyone benefits			2
' so how exactly do the young couple fund their prima donna daughter 's extravagant spending habits ? ' @entity21 has his own building company and i do n't work , ' explains @entity20			2
' we are useless with money but we 're not on benefits			2
' spoilt : like @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity12 gets everything she wants nevertheless , although the @entity106 children do get just about everything their hearts could desire , @entity20 says there have been moments when they 've struggled with money			2
' there was a time a few months ago when we had no work and the kids were as good as gold , ' she reveals			0
' they did n't ask for anything			0
@entity16 who 's only 14 even got a gardening job to help out			0
' ' people say to me : " @entity122 ! you 've got no carpet and your kids are running around in @entity36 jeans ! " ' she does , however , think her spending habits are spiralling out of control and says she needs to get a grip			0
' people say to me : " @entity122 ! you 've got no carpet and your kids are running around in @entity36 jeans ! " ' according to @entity20 , her erratic spending habits were inherited from her own mother who also took a cavalier approach to money			2
' my mum and dad split up and she had to work two jobs so we did n't have a normal upbringing , ' explains @entity20			0
' some days , we would get picked up by @entity143 and limousines from school			0
some days my mum would be rooting around in the cupboards and others we would be in a posh restaurant			0
i think she was trying to find a substitute for my dad not being there			0
' that , however , has n't stopped her from following suit			0
' my mum always said : " you 're not here forever so spend it while you can " and i think she 's right			0
' but does she worry that @entity12 , so keen to splash her father 's cash , will grow up with the same attitude to money			2
amazingly , @entity20 thinks not			0
' no , ' she insists			0
' she 's seen our house and she 's already said " i do n't want to live like this ! " ' the 12 year @entity42 and @entity41 , monday at 10.30pm on @entity40 tv star : @entity12 appears on @entity40 's the 12 year @entity42 and other @entity171 spending kids			1
