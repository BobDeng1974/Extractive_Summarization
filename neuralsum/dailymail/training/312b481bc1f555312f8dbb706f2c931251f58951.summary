a vast camp for migrants in @entity2 will open this morning , sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the @entity6 town			1
it will offer beds , showers , food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach @entity14 from the port			1
the @entity17 camp was built on a former children ’s summer camp using a £ 3million @entity21 grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from @entity14 taxpayers			1
' @entity24 ' : the @entity17 camp , built on the site of a former children 's summer camp , will offer beds , showers , food and power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach @entity14 from @entity2 it sits right next to the @entity2 port , where hundreds of illegals try to board lorries each day in the hope of remaining undetected until reaching @entity14			1
critics of the centre have compared it to the notorious @entity24 camp which became a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed down in 2002			2
@entity43 , a @entity44 mp who sits on the @entity45 , said : ‘ it is bonkers for the @entity2 authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to come to their city , it ’ll only create problems for us next			2
’ @entity53 , another @entity43 mp , said : ‘ this will do nothing to stem the tide of illegal immigrants coming into the @entity14			0
‘ it will clearly lead to even more risking their lives to get here and it is therefore outrageous that this is being partly funded by @entity14 taxpayers			0
meanwhile a third @entity44 , @entity63 , described the plans as ‘ madness ’ and condemned the @entity6 authorities for providing the migrants ‘ with a comfortable base from which to launch their clandestine attempts to break into @entity14 ’			1
repurposed : the camp was built on the site of a former children ’s summer camp using a £ 3million @entity21 grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from @entity14 taxpayers well appointed : the camp includes three football pitches and a tennis court over its 12 - acre site the new permanent day centre is spread over about 12 acres of parkland and comes with three football pitches and a tennis court			1
perhaps the only item the holiday camp will lack is a swimming pool			2
from today , @entity6 - based charity @entity87 will serve food to up to 500 migrants			1
they will be capable of serving food to 1,500 migrants by mid-march and will also be able to sleep 500 women and children by then			1
at the moment a second centre – @entity95 – is currently providing refuge to 500 migrants on cold nights			1
the migrants , many of whom have smartphones , will be able to charge their mobiles at power points , helping them to surf the internet on their devices			2
the centre will have hot showers , toilet facilities and a nurse to treat injuries they sustain from attempting to jump on lorries			0
it is also believed that there will be an office in the complex which will be manned by officers from the @entity118			0
they will be there to inform the migrants of the realities of entering @entity14 , in an apparent effort to dissuade them			0
the estimated 2,500 migrants in @entity2 are mainly from @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 in @entity128 and the war - torn states of @entity131 and @entity132			0
desperate to get to @entity14 : migrants run behind a truck bound for @entity135 from @entity2 to try to board it the @entity6 interior minister , @entity137 , announced the plans to build the migrant centre in @entity2 in october , saying it will cost around £ 4.3million to run each year			1
last month @entity141 , deputy mayor of @entity2 , claimed that the lure of the @entity14 benefits system is the reason for migrants flocking to @entity2 and not the new centre			0
but @entity147 , the vice-chairman of @entity148 @entity14 , said : ‘ the sort of facility proposed by the @entity6 will undoubtedly lead to further illegal immigration			2
‘ the @entity6 authorities should be removing illegal migrants , not encouraging them and then asking the @entity14 tax payer to help foot the bill			2
’ @entity156 , prefect of the @entity2 , insisted that the centre was an ‘ important provision ’ which would be run with ‘ utmost professionalism ’			0
he said : ‘ there was massive influx of migrants in the summer months from @entity128 , particularly @entity125			0
‘ we were caught off guard and the sheer numbers led us to take emergency measures			0
‘ at present the situation has stabilised in terms of numbers , but come the warmer weather the numbers are again likely to increase			0

@entity17 camp offers beds , showers , food and power *outlets* for phones
spread over 12 acres , it includes three football pitches and a tennis court
from today , @entity6 charity @entity87 will serve food to 500 migrants
