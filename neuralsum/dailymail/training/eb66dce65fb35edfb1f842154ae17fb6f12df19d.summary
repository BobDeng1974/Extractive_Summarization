@entity0 are baulking at the total cost of a swoop for @entity4 midfielder @entity3			1
having landed marquee signing @entity5 , the @entity7 will now turn their attentions to signing a holding defensive midfielder			1
@entity3 , who has just 12 months let on his contract at @entity4 , features highly on @entity12 's midfield hit list			1
and despite the @entity21 remaining a target , the financial outlay attached to the deal has cast doubt on a potential move			0
the 27 - year - old could cost in - excess of £ 20million despite the fact he has just 12 months left to run on his @entity4 contract			1
in addition , @entity3 is understood to want at least £ 150,000 - per - week , a package that would make him @entity0 's best paid player			2
@entity0 have the financial capacity to complete such a move but committing £ 60million ( including wages ) to land @entity5 has taken a significant sum out of @entity12 's transfer budget			2
@entity45 man : @entity46 international @entity5 completed his £ 30million move to @entity0 on thursday likewise , the @entity7 have also agreed to pay @entity48 £ 11million for right - back @entity49			1
and with a new goalkeeper , centre - back and striker still on @entity12 's radar , a move for @entity3 could prove a step too far			0
@entity12 is also hugely interested in @entity58 midfielder @entity57			0
and a move for the @entity61 international is likely to have less strain on the club 's finances			0
@entity7 chiefs have already made contact with @entity58 executives about their interest in @entity57			0
should a move for @entity3 or @entity57 not materialise , @entity0 will turn to @entity71 's @entity70 in their search for a new central midfielder			0

the @entity7 are baulking at the cost of a swoop for the @entity61 star
@entity3 has just 12 months left to run on his @entity4 contract
but the @entity84 *giants* want in excess of £ 20million for the midfielder
