a stately home sold by a cash - strapped council has increased in value by more than £ 2 million since the sale - sparking fears the local authority did not negotiate the best deal for the taxpayer			1
controversy followed the sale of @entity9 - the birthplace of former conservative prime minister sir @entity10 - when it was sold by @entity11 in 2012 for just £ 241,000			1
now the historic building , near @entity13 , @entity14 , is being marketed by the new owner and could fetch up to £ 2.5 million			1
@entity9 , ( pictured ) was sold by @entity11 in 2012 for £ 241,000 - it could now sell for up to £ 2.5 million the hall , which is advertised as a ' substantial country house with an abundance of architectural delight ' , is up for sale along with 25 acres of grounds , stables , courtyard , clock tower and cottages			1
it has been described by the @entity27 as one of the @entity30 's ' most historically significant buildings '			0
@entity11 defended the sale , and said the £ 241,000 it raised represented ' good value ' after the housing market crash , adding that £ 3 million worth of repairs were required to bring the hall up to scratch			1
sir @entity10 ( pictured ) a former @entity35 prime minister , was born at @entity9 in 1897 but county councillor @entity36 , who originally challenged the council over the sale , said : ' the idea that they got best value for it is a load of rot			1
heads should roll over this			0
' a spokesman for the @entity48 added : ' this is an extraordinary hike in such a short time , so one can only assume the property was significantly undervalued when it was sold			2
' the council is n't a property speculator so was right to offload the property , but it should n't have been sold off on the cheap			2
' with the council trying to make savings , there 's no excuse for negotiating such a bad deal for taxpayers			0
' owner @entity61 , 58 , said he had hoped developing the site would fund the restoration of the 30 - bedroomed grade ii * listed mansion to its original splendour			1
but after failing to secure additional land for a new equestrian centre and seeing a planned sale of seven and - a - half acres of land for executive housing come to nothing , he and his family are selling up			1
the site is being sold in lots by estate agents @entity77 , which has offices in @entity79 and @entity14			1
the hall , along with the @entity30 and @entity81 , is being advertised for £ 1.5 million , the stables , courtyard and clock tower for £ 395,000 , ' the @entity86 ' plot for £ 245,000 , six two - storey terraced cottages for £ 270,000 and a cottage and field for £ 150,000			1
@entity77 director @entity90 said her client felt ' vilified by baseless comments ' they had been subjected to since they bought the hall and said it had been newly priced based on comparisons in the area			0
she said : ' my client bought a property that was in dire condition and there has been an extraordinary amount of work undertaken to stabilise , repair and improve the property			2
' unfortunately the plans for the property were not realised due to not being able to acquire additional land as originally anticipated			0
' my client has gone to great lengths to understand the best viable and sustainable use for the property going forward and we are looking for a buyer who can do just that			0
' it 's a beautiful property of significant historical importance and [ the owners ] should be applauded for rescuing it at a very low point of the real estate market in 2011			0
' a lot of time , money and effort has been invested even after it was known that the property would not be able to used for the original intended purpose			0
' @entity124 , of @entity126 - based estate agent @entity125 , who earlier this year was instructed to sell seven acres of land adjacent to the hall , backed both the authority and the owners			1
mr @entity124 said @entity125 withdrew its involvement after being told the chances of planning permission for housing was slim			0
he said : ' the @entity137 have done nothing wrong , they were granted an opportunity to buy the hall at a quarter of a million quid and it was worth the investment			0
the historical building , near @entity13 , @entity14 , could fetch up to £ 2.5m after undergoing ' an extraordinary amount of work ' current owner @entity61 had hoped to secure additional land for a new equestrian centre , but is now selling up @entity11 ( pictured ) said given the condition of the building the offer they accepted was ' the only viable one we received ' ' there has been no underhand dealing by the local authority or the owners			1
the council had something that they thought was a liability , they offered it on the open market and people offered what they thought			0
' the mistake the council probably made was not offering it back to the open market and inviting an increased offer			0
' @entity169 , @entity11 's corporate director of regeneration , said : ' an external auditor carried out a full investigation into the sale of @entity9 and concluded that it was not possible to substantiate claims that the council could have made more money from the sale			1
' the auditor also found that the sale was compliant with the council 's policy requirements			0
' the property was on the market for a number of years , during which time we worked extremely hard to secure an offer that would protect the building 's historic importance and also provide the best value for money for the council			0
' given the condition of the building , the state of the market , the very significant maintenance costs that were being incurred by the council and the limitations on any possible development in the grounds , the offer we eventually accepted was the only viable one we received			2
' as well as generating £ 240,000 for the council , the sale of the hall has delivered substantial savings to the council , including £ 300,000 since november 2011 on security , heating and repair costs			2
' the council is also no longer responsible for carrying out the £ 3m of urgent repairs that the building required			2
