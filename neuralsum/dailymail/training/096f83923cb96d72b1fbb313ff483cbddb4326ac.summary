by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 17:51 est , 30 october 2012 up to six new nuclear power reactors will power 14million homes for 60 years following a massive deal announced yesterday			2
in the most significant boost yet for government plans for a new network of atomic power stations , @entity5 engineering giant @entity4 took on a project to construct plants in @entity12 and @entity13			1
the £ 700million deal will create 12,000 jobs for construction workers , engineers and other skilled employees , and spark a broader multi-billion - pound investment in the nuclear industry			2
deal : @entity23 , @entity4 's vice president and executive officer , at a news conference in @entity27 as it confirms it is to buy @entity28 two @entity30 firms , power systems provider @entity29 and engineering services group @entity32 , will work with @entity4 on the project			1
@entity30 currently has ten nuclear power stations , generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity , around 19 per cent of @entity30 ’s electricity needs			2
by 2023 , all but one – @entity38 in @entity39 – will have become obsolete			0
this could trigger an energy crisis , as one third of @entity30 ’s old - fashioned coal - fired and oil - fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time			0
the future of the nuclear industry had been thrown into doubt , however , by the decision of @entity51 ’s @entity50 and @entity52 to pull out of developments in the @entity30			1
energy secretary : @entity55 said the move was a ' vote of confidence ' in @entity30 energy policy now @entity4 is buying @entity28 – which has the rights to build reactors at @entity62 on @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 in @entity13 – from the @entity51 firms			1
ministers and unions hailed the deal , but green campaigners described it as a ‘ risky and expensive gamble			0
’ @entity72 said the announcement was a ‘ decades - long , multi-billion - pound vote of confidence ’ in the @entity30			1
the prime minister added : ‘ it will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational , as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the @entity30 ’s nuclear supply chain			0
’ @entity84 secretary @entity55 said : ‘ @entity4 bring with them decades of expertise , and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget , so i welcome their commitment to helping build a low - carbon secure energy future for the @entity30			1
i particularly welcome @entity4 ’s firm commitment to involve the @entity30 supply chain and local workforce			1
‘ new nuclear is n’t only about keeping the lights on and emissions down , it ’s an industrial strategy with big potential wins			0
’ the minister said there had been a ‘ huge amount of interest ’ from across the world in buying @entity28 , adding that the @entity30 could now become a ‘ springboard ’ for nuclear development in other countries			1
he stressed there would be no public subsidy and that developers would be responsible for decommissioning costs			0
mr @entity55 added : ‘ we have made it very clear that there will be no public subsidy for new nuclear			0
there is no taxpayer subsidy in this at all			0
’ @entity4 and ministers played down safety fears in the wake of last year ’s @entity125 power plant meltdown in @entity5 , pointing to the @entity30 ’s strong regulatory regime and the company ’s track record in building safe nuclear plants			1
@entity130 , vice-president of @entity4 , said the company would invest billions of pounds in @entity30 nuclear operations , adding : ‘ our aim is to build safe nuclear power stations , on time and on budget , to provide long - term , affordable energy			1
’ investment : @entity4 plans to employ its advanced boiling water technology , which is already in use in four reactors in @entity5 however , @entity4 uses an advanced boiling water reactor for its plants – different from existing nuclear plants in @entity30 – raising concerns that it could take years to approve the projects			1
@entity147 , general secretary - designate of the @entity149 union , said : ‘ while @entity4 ’s advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the @entity30 ’s generic design assessment approval process , it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the @entity30 will benefit from lessons learned from its construction in @entity5			1
’ unite national officer @entity156 said : ‘ this is good news for the @entity30 nuclear industry , for jobs and for a low - carbon future			0
‘ there are massive job opportunities here in the @entity30 and we urge @entity4 to maximise the @entity30 supply chain			1
’ @entity168 energy campaigner @entity166 said : ‘ it speaks volumes about the @entity30 ’s struggling nuclear programme that the government is promoting a reactor that ’s years from being granted @entity30 safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build @entity125			2
’ the government has plans to develop new nuclear reactors on eight sites , but until yesterday had struggled to persuade companies to invest			0
the move by @entity5 giant @entity4 to build new reactors in the @entity30 has led to renewed calls by environmentalists for the nuclear programme to be abandoned			1
@entity4 's advanced boiling water reactor is different from existing nuclear plants in @entity30 and from designs being developed by other companies for sites here , prompting claims it will take years to approve the projects			1
@entity168 energy campaigner @entity166 said : ' it speaks volumes about the @entity30 's struggling nuclear programme that the government is promoting a reactor that 's years from being granted @entity30 safety approval and is designed by the company that helped build @entity125			2
' instead of waiting years to find out how much billpayers will end up subsidising this project , the government should join @entity5 and @entity51 , abandon nuclear , and invest instead in clean , renewable energy			2
' @entity202 's @entity201 said : ' this is a risky and expensive gamble for @entity4 that other energy firms are unwilling to take - and contrary to the promises the coalition has made , the public will end up funding it			0
' nuclear has always delivered late and over budget , and crucially it wo n't reduce emissions until the 2020s , when to tackle climate change , we need emissions cuts to happen straight away			0
' he added : ' last night 's nuclear safety alert in the face of hurricane @entity220 was a stark reminder of @entity125 and how vulnerable our energy infrastructure can be			0
' @entity4 said there were four advanced boiling water reactors in @entity5 , all of which were delivered on time , and another four under construction in @entity5 and @entity228			1
the design is based on previous boiling water reactors , using water heated directly by the nuclear core to create steam to drive electricity turbines , of which there are 84 worldwide including in the @entity237 , @entity51 , @entity238 and @entity239			2
the reactors at @entity125 , where nuclear disaster struck when the site was hit by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami in march 2011 , were also boiling water reactors			0
but professor @entity246 , director of the @entity247 at the @entity248 , said the reactors at @entity125 dated back to the 1960s			0
' the design will have advanced significantly between the 1960s and 2000s			0
' professor @entity252 , director of the @entity253 , said boiling water reactors had to conform to the same safety standards as other plants , which the @entity30 understood well			2
but he said the @entity30 would need to train up operators so they understood the ' subtly ' different requirements of boiling water reactors			2
prof @entity260 said he thought today 's announcement was very good news for the @entity30 , which had challenging targets to cut carbon that required the development of nuclear as well as renewables			0
but he said the need for a nuclear renaissance would not lead to corners being cut or decisions rushed through , saying ' that could n't happen in the @entity30 '			0
future : the existing power station at @entity62 , on @entity63 , where @entity4 will build new reactors			1

@entity5 firm to buy @entity28 from @entity51 owners @entity50 and @entity52 *npower*
@entity4 intends to progress plans to build reactors on @entity63 , @entity64 , and in @entity13
@entity72 said the deal represents a ' multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the @entity30 '
