by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are confident @entity3 will be galvanised by the shock of being initially dropped for the third test against @entity6 on saturday to make light of the late withdrawal of @entity9			1
the tourists were forced into a late reshuffle by the loss of @entity9 , who was unable to shake off a hamstring strain which has hampered him this week			1
the @entity15 lock was identified by head coach @entity16 as the team ’s leading forward in the first two tests and @entity18 conceded that his absence will be keenly felt			2
passing muster : @entity3 ( second left ) , in training in @entity23 , will replace @entity9 in the pack in the running : @entity26 ( centre ) sprints during @entity2 's training session in @entity23 @entity29 explains seven third - test changes ‘ he 's been in great form and leading very well from the front as far as the forward pack is concerned , ’ @entity18 said			1
‘ he was struggling at the beginning of the week and did everything he possibly could to get right , but he is n't right to play at @entity17 intensity			0
' it 's a big loss for us but we have good cover in that position and a couple of hungry boys waiting to do the job for us tomorrow			1
’ the cover in the starting xv is @entity26 , but the young @entity48 second row has struggled during the @entity17 in @entity49 and @entity50 , which led to him being removed from the team for this match , to be replaced by @entity54			2
@entity16 claimed that the 23 - year - old is tired at the end of a long season but @entity9 ’s injury has presented him with an unexpected opportunity to end the tour on a high and @entity18 is optimistic he can do that			1
‘ @entity3 was gutted to not be starting the match , ’ he said			0
‘ from the reviews , he knows the reasons why , he 's licked his wounds a little bit and has a chance to start			2
i 'm sure we 'll get more out of him because of that initial disappointment			0
he 's champing at the bit and raring to go			0
’ grabbing the opportunity with both hands : @entity26 has been backed to take his chance by @entity18 @entity76 ( @entity77 ) ; @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , @entity80 ( @entity15 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , @entity83 ( @entity77 ) ; @entity84 ( @entity15 ) , @entity85 ( @entity15 ) ; @entity86 ( @entity77 ) , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , @entity89 ( @entity82 ) ; @entity90 ( @entity88 ) , @entity26 ( @entity48 ) ; @entity91 ( @entity88 ) , @entity92 ( @entity79 ) , @entity93 ( @entity77			2
substitutes : @entity95 ( @entity82 ) , @entity96 ( @entity48 ) , @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , @entity99 ( @entity82 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , @entity102 ( @entity88 ) , @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , @entity105 ( @entity88 )			0
after the @entity6 named their line - up for saturday ’s game at @entity109 , head coach @entity106 mischievously suggested that @entity2 are in a tactical ‘ quandary ’ , after , ‘ @entity111 took us on in @entity50 playing a game of real pace and worked out they could n’t ’			1
@entity18 was asked to respond to the remark and hit back by saying that it followed accusations that @entity2 had tried to employ stalling tactics in the series opener			2
‘ well , we did n't try to slow the game down in the first test and they thought that was our tactics and now they say we ’re trying to speed the game up and ca n’t do that , ’ he said			0
‘ the reality is that the game always takes its own path and we ’ve got to be in control of our own game and we want to play quick at the right times , be composed at the right times and slow things down when needed			0
we ’ll be ready for either way of playing			0
’ the @entity2 squad watched their football counterparts lose to @entity138 early on friday morning , local time , and @entity18 admitted that they were ‘ gutted ’ by the outcome			1
but they are convinced that they can lift the spirits of the nation ’s sports fans and finish this promising tour with the victory they crave			0
gutted : @entity18 and the @entity2 squad were left disappointed by the footballers ' defeat by @entity138			1

@entity2 forced into late reshuffle by @entity9 's hamstring strain
@entity154 a ' big loss ' but that has given @entity26 another chance
@entity2 coach @entity18 hits back at @entity6 ' @entity159
@entity2 watched footballers lose 2 - 1 to @entity138 in @entity162
