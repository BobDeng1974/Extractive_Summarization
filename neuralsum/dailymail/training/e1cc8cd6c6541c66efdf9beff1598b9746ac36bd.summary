the defeats get harder to take , the near misses more difficult to shrug off			2
@entity2 is only 29 yet , already , the @entity4 midfielder has begun to dread the creeping advance of years – and the threat of ending his career with one great football ambition frustratingly unfulfilled			1
@entity2 , one of several in the current squad who will be in their 30s by the time @entity11 2016 comes around , believes that the quality of the current group – the best he 's seen , says the @entity16 skipper – and the extended nature of the @entity18 means @entity4 have never had a better chance of returning to a major finals			1
yet the combative all - rounder admits that the fear of being part of yet another failed campaign – this is his fifth crack at the big time – motivates him as much as anything			1
' looking back on those campaigns , i was thinking : ' oh , we did n't get there again			1
we 're devastated – but we 'll try next time '			2
' now i 'm starting to think : " i might never get there "			2
there are a few people in that dressing room the same age as me , maybe even a wee bit older , who probably think the same way as well : " we 've not got long left in the game , so we desperately want to get to a major finals "			1
' for @entity54 , as well , this is huge			2
he wants to get to a @entity35 and it 's one of the few things not on his cv , as well			2
pretty much everyone in the dressing room - well maybe not young @entity61 ! – remembers @entity11 ' 98 and what a great occasion that was			1
' we want to get that belief back that @entity4 is n't just a team that turns up for one or two games but can do it over a whole campaign			1
' @entity11 is definitely the biggest one for us			1
we all want to try everything to get there — leave nothing out on the park			2
it would mean more to us than anyone in the country			0
as a @entity4 fan myself , i know it would be great for the whole country			1
' it definitely bothers me			0
i do n't want to look back over my career and be saying : " if i had only done this , if i 'd only done that ... " i 've got to give 120 per cent			1
everyone in that changing room is the same , giving everything to get there ' we know it 's been a long time since @entity11 98			1
we think we 've got the quality to get there again and , with the extra qualifying place as well , that will definitely help			2
' it 's good to hear @entity4 players talk about the hurt , acknowledging the pain of failure as keenly as the most devoted supporter			1
if the possibility of never making it motivates this bunch to new heights , in a campaign where the top two in each group win an invite to the expanded finals , all the better			1
@entity2 knows expectations are high as @entity4 dream of ending their 18 - year exile from major tournaments @entity2 , one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in saturday 's home match against @entity32 , insisted on friday that quality and a sense of shared responsibility gives this group an edge over some of its predecessors			1
' it 's definitely the best chance we 've had to qualify , because it 's the best group of lads i 've been in , ' he said			2
' you can see the team bonding			0
it 's not people sitting over here and there in little groups – everyone can chat to everyone			0
' the manager has done a lot , bringing players in , talking to them himself			0
those are maybe the little differences that will hopefully get us there			0
' there is no room for egos			0
all the lads are down to earth – and i think they all realise that anybody could take their place			0
' we 've brought in the likes of @entity157 and @entity158 , who have been excellent in training this week			2
' it 's good to see people like that up close in training			0
when you play against them , you maybe do n't notice how good they are unless you 're directly up against them			2
' when you train with them , you see how good they are at linking up			0
@entity170 has been a joy to play with			2
' when you look at the squad , it 's probably the strongest i 've been involved with			1
it 's looking good , training has been brilliant			0
' we 've played 11 v 11 with subs , as well			2
and you look at the subs and think : ' he could bring on anyone here and still have a strong 11 '			0
so it 's looking great			0
' there are players for every position			0
there are 11 , 12 , 13 great players – and then you think : " wow , look at the players coming in on top of that			0
jeez , they could easily take someone 's place "			0
@entity2 on @entity4 's qualifier : ' we 've got to be brave and play attacking football especially at @entity199 as well ' @entity2 remains one of two frontrunners for the captaincy in saturday 's home match against @entity32 ' it 's great for competition , it makes everyone raise their game – and you can see that in training over the last couple of days			1
' we 've got top quality players so we should be at tournaments - but we need to work together as a group			1
we 're doing that to the best of our ability now			0
' on the captaincy issue , @entity2 remains in the dark			1
full of praise for main rival @entity54 , he concedes that being handed the armband is a tremendous honour ; there is more than a hint of him wanting the leadership role			0
yet he 's wary not to put personal ambition before national interest , noting : ' whoever goes out there , we 've got a lot of great leaders who want to win			1
that 's what you need			0
' we are all desperate to win , all desperate to be in @entity11			1
and we believe we can do it – we all believe it			0
it 's not about fighting over a captaincy – it 's about joining together and being more of a team than ever			0
' relaxed and at ease , @entity2 gave off the air of a man confident of his place in the squad			1
and saturday 's starting @entity250 , for that matter , although he joked about the ' national debate ' over the captaincy issue , saying : ' i thought that was all over … it was a no vote , was n't it ? ' as for a return to @entity199 , a venue familiar only to those @entity16 players with at least a few years ' service under their belts , the man who added to his cult status with one particular @entity259 goal celebration said he was looking forward to the experience			1
if nothing else , being applauded at this particular stadium will be a new one for him , although he ducked an obvious question about whether he 'd be ' doing a @entity269 ' in the event of scoring for his country , declaring : ' i do n't even know if i 'm playing ! ' maybe he was n't expecting his place to be confirmed until this morning , when @entity273 was due to officially announce his starting @entity250 , subs and skipper			0
but @entity2 sounded like a man who knew he was part of the manager 's plans			1
a man desperate to make every appearance count			0
before it 's too late .			0
