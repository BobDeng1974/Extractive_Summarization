by @entity0 new figures will reignite debates within the @entity4 party about their treatment of the squeezed middle the number of @entity8 paying the 40p tax rate has risen by almost 400 per cent in 30 years			1
this year 4.4million will pay higher - rate income tax compared with just 930,000 in 1984			1
more than a million people have been dragged into the tax band since the @entity13 took power			1
an official report blamed the government ’s policy of lowering the threshold at which workers start paying the 40p rate , to pay for an increase in the personal allowance to help those on low incomes			2
@entity25 did increase the threshold in this year ’s @entity27 – but by just 1 per cent , below the rate of inflation			1
the latest changes mean the income at which we pay the 40p tax rate has fallen from £ 43,875 at the time of the last election to £ 41,865 today			2
the report from the @entity38 library said the threshold would be almost £ 50,000 if it had kept pace with the @entity42 measure of inflation since 2010			2
the figures will reignite the debate within the @entity4 over the decision to focus tax cuts on the low - paid while ignoring the squeezed middle classes			1
@entity4 @entity49 are pushing for a clear commitment to address the 40p tax rate in the party ’s next manifesto			1
former minister @entity54 said : ‘ the 40p rate kicks in at too low a level – that is becoming increasingly clear			0
‘ the original idea was to catch people on earnings that were way above the average			0
‘ now it ’s catching people who are struggling to pay a mortgage			0
‘ i think the @entity4 will want to be seen as a party that does not penalise people who work hard and want to be successful , and that does mean taking action on his issue			2
’ thirty years ago , when higher - rate tax was levied at between 40 and 60 per cent depending on income , it was paid by 930,000 – fewer than 4 per cent of taxpayers			1
@entity25 did raise the threshold - by one per cent , which is less than the rate of inflation @entity79 cut the top rate to a flat 40 per cent in 1988			1
in its first full year , the rate was paid by 1.56million , or 6 per cent of taxpayers			0
yet by the turn of the century , the number paying the top rate had risen to 2.5million , or 9 per cent of workers			0
the figure now stands at a 4.4million , with a further 313,000 paying the top rate of 45p			0
the @entity38 report said : ‘ the number of taxpayers paying the additional or higher rates of tax remain a minority – around 16 per cent			0
however , this group pays a very large share of the total amount paid			0
’ it cited @entity100 figures showing the top 10 per cent of taxpayers – or 5 per cent of adults – now account for 59 per cent of total income tax contributions .			0
