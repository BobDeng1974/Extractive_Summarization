a @entity1 man who is on a federal aviation watch list was asked to undergo additional screening after his flight landed because security officers apparently failed to carry out the necessary checks before he boarded the plane			1
the flight carrying @entity9 was already in the sky by the time @entity13 officials realised the error			2
the 22 - year - old was once on a ‘ no - fly list ’ but is now on a ‘ selectee list ’ that calls for a more rigorous screening process than usual before boarding			1
@entity9 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , and a friend documented his experience in a series of mobile phone videos that have been posted online			2
when the flight landed in @entity22 earlier this month , @entity9 was asked to disembark before all other passengers and submit himself to a secondary search			1
one of the videos shows him in the terminal at @entity41 , where he was greeted by a group of @entity13 officers who asked him to step into a private area so they could ‘ screen your body and your bags ’			1
@entity48 moment : @entity9 's used his mobile phone to film his encounter with @entity13 officers in the video , @entity9 refuses to co-operate and questions why the search is required and whether he is being detained			1
the @entity13 does not have the authority to detain passengers			2
the officer , who is wearing latex gloves , tells him : ‘ we need to do some screening that may or may not have been completed in @entity26			0
’ when @entity9 asks the officer why the screening has to be done after his flight landed , he is told : ' because it was n't completed in @entity26			2
' but @entity9 refuses to accompany him as the argument goes back and forth : ‘ if i travelled from point a to point @entity67 safely why does there now need to be more screening before i am allowed to leave ? that would lead to me believe that i am being detained would it not ? are you detaining me ? ’ @entity9 decides to walk away after the officer informs him he is not being detained but that he would be apprehended by @entity22 police if he does n’t agree to the search			1
he later flew back to @entity26 without any trouble			0
@entity13 officers surround @entity9 as he is told that some screening ' may or may not have been completed ' another video shows him exiting the plane in @entity22 in front of confused passengers			1
he tells the camera : ' i ’m the only one walking off the airplane right now , so this is really interesting			0
' they let me fly all the way to @entity22 so here i am			0
look at everybody here , they ’re wondering what ’s going on with this guy			0
no , i have not committed a crime			0
’ a third video , recorded by a friend , purports to show @entity9 being patted down by a security officer at @entity96 before he boarded the flight to @entity22			2
a @entity13 officer speaks to a co-worker or supervisor after @entity9 refused to co-operate passengers who are on the ‘ selectee list ’ receive a boarding pass with four bold s ’s printed on it			1
that alerts security officers that more rigorous screening , including a physical patdown and a bag check , is required			1
but reports by @entity113 affiliate @entity112 in @entity26 and @entity115 affiliate @entity114 in @entity22 suggest that the extra screening did not occur			2
a @entity25 spokesperson told @entity112 that the flagged boarding pass was noticed by an airline employee who contacted the @entity13			0
the @entity13 told @entity120 that it is reviewing the incident and ' all passengers are thoroughly screened before boarding a commercial aircraft			0
’ a @entity13 officer informed @entity9 that he would be apprehended by police if he did n't agree to the search @entity9 told @entity114 he found out three years ago he was on the @entity1 government ’s ‘ no - fly list ’ but no one would tell him why			1
he insisted he has no connection to terrorism and has suggested that he landed himself in trouble with comments he previously posted on a political website used by people who consider themselves ‘ sovereign citizens ’			0
three years ago he was turned away and detained when he attempted to board a flight from @entity138 to @entity31			0
@entity120 has contacted the @entity13 , @entity25 and @entity139 for comment .			0

@entity9 was asked to exit the plane in front of other passengers
@entity31 man refused to co-operate with @entity13 officers at @entity22 airport
