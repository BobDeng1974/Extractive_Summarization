by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 correspondent rastafarian inmates are being handed @entity4 , drums and shakers after their religion was officially recognised by prison chiefs			1
new rules mean @entity10 is an approved religion alongside @entity12 , @entity13 and other major faiths			1
the pack has been created to ensure @entity18 prisoners can pray together in a ‘ fulsome and harmonious way ’ , a faith advisor said			2
however , the religion ’s followers have been told that one common element of their religious practice is barred : they can not smoke cannabis in jail			2
the @entity18 faith was brought wider attention by the music of @entity29 , left			0
adherents of the religion see @entity32 , right , who was @entity32 between 1930 and 1974 , as a divine being and worship him the change in policy came after an unnamed inmate appealed to @entity36 , the @entity37			2
he ruled that the @entity38 was in breach of the @entity40 , and said @entity10 , whose followers worship @entity32 , the former @entity32 , as @entity43 and smoke cannabis as a ‘ sacrament ’ , should be recognised			1
rastafarians are permitted four days ‘ holiday ’ off work in prison each year to celebrate festivals , and are given access to a ‘ @entity51 ’			1
the new rules were put in place in november 2013 and make @entity10 one of the 18 religions officially recognised within the prison service it includes a list of ‘ allowed items ’ provided by the @entity60 for weekly ‘ @entity61 ’ ( @entity62 ) ceremonies			1
among them are a cd or dvd of @entity51 drumming , music and chanting , including reggae tracks by @entity29 , and percussion instruments			0
in addition prisoners are given a small @entity18 flag , a picture of @entity32 , a selection of his speeches and a copy of the @entity77			2
however , cannabis remains banned			0
a spokesman for @entity80 to the @entity81 said : ‘ this pack provides information , texts from his majesty ’s speeches ... some of the best - loved reggae tracks , as well as information that sets @entity10 in the context of black history			1
‘ every detail in the pack has been double - checked to ensure that no further blocks or barriers are placed to prevent @entity10 from meeting and giving @entity98 [ praise ] together in a fulsome and harmonious way			1
’ the @entity101 , which runs prisons in @entity103 and @entity104 , recognises 18 religions			1
they include @entity106 and @entity107 , an ancient @entity109 religion			0
at the time of the 2011 census , there were 7,906 @entity10 in @entity103 and @entity104 - up from 5,000 in 2001 - making it the 14th largest recognised religion recorded by the survey			1
@entity117 - a religion emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind @entity119 - based on teachings attributed to @entity121 , who is commonly known as the @entity121 , meaning " the awakened one "			2
christianity - religion based on the life and oral teachings of @entity126 as presented in the @entity127			2
@entity128 - which states that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer @entity132 - the @entity133 church which considers itself as the restoration of the church founded by @entity126 @entity136 - the dominant religion in the @entity138 subcontinent based on karma humanism - a religion which focuses on the value of human beings , based on rationalism islam - followers of the @entity145 and teachings of @entity147 @entity149 - @entity138 religion which prescribes a path of non-violence @entity152 - a belief based on @entity154 which thinks @entity155 is imminent and the only solution is to establish @entity157 on earth @entity159 - the way of life of jewish people , which follows the @entity164			0
@entity165 varied strand of religious beliefs from the ' classical world ' , including @entity169 and many which focus on the natural world as ' creator '			0
@entity174 - @entity173 , who believe in the @entity127 @entity177 - based religion worshipping @entity32 , the emperor of @entity178 between 1930 and 1974 @entity179 which believes in the sanctity of saturday , the original sabbath of the @entity159 - @entity128 calendar			0
sikhism - a 15th century religion following @entity184 @entity186 - a belief that the spirits of the dead can communicate with the living @entity107 - an ancient @entity109 religion @entity10 is a religion that developed in @entity192 after the coronation of @entity32 as @entity32 in 1930			1
followers of the religion believe emperor @entity32 is @entity43 and will lead back to @entity197 members of the black community who were taken away by slavery and colonialism			0
emperor @entity201 never saw himself as @entity43 and was not himself as @entity18			0
the belief in him as a divine being stemmed from a prophecy from @entity192 - born philosopher @entity205			0
he said , shortly before @entity32 's coronation : ' look to @entity197 where a black king shall be crowned			0
he shall be the redeemer			0
' @entity10 trace @entity32 's lineage back to @entity210 and the @entity211			1
the @entity212 describes a visit to @entity210 by the @entity211 and adherents of @entity10 believe that a child was conceived on this visit and that this child is a direct ancestor of @entity32 , making the @entity32 a relation to @entity219 and therefore @entity126			1
for the coronation itself , @entity220 was unable to attend so instead sent the @entity223 as his emissary			0
at the time , due to the size of the @entity226 , @entity220 was seen as the most powerful man in the world			0
so , when the @entity223 bowed to @entity32 , @entity10 took the act of deference as an indication that the new emperor was more important than the @entity233 - who the @entity223 was representing - and therefore the most powerful man on the planet			1
there are more than one million @entity10 worldwide			2
they see @entity237 as their spiritual homeland and believe they are destined to return - led by @entity32			0
although @entity201 was reported to have died in 1975 , some @entity10 refused to believe this and there is still some debate within the religion as to whether he is , in fact , dead			2
adherents of the faith are forbidden to cut their hair , which is why they grow dreadlocks , refrain from eating meat ( especially pork ) , are opposed to contraception and abortion , do not drink , believe in reincarnation and smoke marijuana to increase their spiritual awareness .			1
