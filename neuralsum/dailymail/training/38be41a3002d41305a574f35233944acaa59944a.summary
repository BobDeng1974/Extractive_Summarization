by @entity0 from freckles and blemishes to staring glass eyes , hyper - realistic models of early hominids are now providing an eerie way of coming face - to - face with our ancient ancestors and distant cousins			1
the sculptures as if like they could come to life at any second , thanks to the incredible attention to detail of ’ palaeoartist ’ @entity19			2
having initially wanted to make masks for theatre , she became interested in human evolution over her 20 year career has recreated @entity25 – the famed australopithecus afarensis specimen that lived between three million and two million years ago - as well as a host of other hominids and @entity29			1
hypnotic gaze : from freckles to staring glass eyes , hyper realistic models of early hominids give humans an eerie way of coming face - to - face with our 3million - year - old relatives			2
a model of @entity40 based on cast of the 2.1million to 2.7million - year - old skull @entity43 discovered in @entity44 is pictured @entity19 first examines the skull of a specimen to mark out distinctive features			1
she and her team make computer models of the skulls using 18 data points on the bone , which gives her an idea of muscles , the shape of a hominid ’s nose , forehead and chin			2
she uses clay to mould the facial features across a cast taken from a skull			0
examining other bones and teeth gives her an idea of other details and the creature 's stature			0
once the clay sculpture is complete , silicone cast is made , onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted			2
she consults scientific experts and reports to decide on features such as eye and hair colour			1
prosthetic eyes and teeth give life to the model and a mixture of human and yak hair is used for @entity88 model takes months to make			1
her work has been exhibited in museums across the world , which is informed by scientific research , brought to life by sculpting techniques in her @entity96 studio			1
‘ i have a clear vocation – to reveal the secrets of ancient bones and evidence of the past			0
' to give those distant beings their face , their identity , their humanity back , ' she said			1
‘ i became obsessed with skulls			0
i wanted to give a face to every skull i saw			2
the goal was n’t any longer to contribute to the making of a play or film , but to decipher the origins of mankind			0
’ ms @entity117 ’ first challenge was to reconstruct a woolly mammoth and a group of @entity121 people who lived around 11,000 years ago			0
@entity122 adds sculpts clay to form muscles and skin on top of a cast of a specimen 's skull to make her models			1
this model is of a 18,000 - year - old homo floresiensis and its appearance is informed by cranial measurements marked with toothpicks ( also pictured ) ms @entity19 seeks to reveal the secrets of ancient bones and give ancient humans , such as this @entity140 from @entity141 in @entity142 , their face , identity and humanity back to make her models , which include the tiniest of details from wrinkles to goose pimples , she starts with a thorough examination of the specimen ’s skull , which marks out many distinctive hominid groups			1
ms @entity19 and her team now make computer models of the skulls using 18 data points on the bone , which gives her an idea of muscles , the shape of a hominid ’s nose , forehead and chin			1
she then uses clay to mould the facial features - informed by her research - across a cast taken from the skull in question , while examining extra bones and teeth give her more of an idea of the creature ’s stature			1
‘ i always follow the same rigorous two - step protocol : first , i focus on highlighting the general features of the fossil group to which the skull belongs ; then i reveal the particular traits of the subject , ’ she said			0
to make her models she starts with a thorough examination of the specimen 's skull , which marks out many distinctive hominid groups			2
a mixture of human and yak hair is used for hominids such as @entity188 , who lived in @entity190 during the @entity191 from about 2.3 to 1.2 million years ago the sculptor uses clay to mould the facial features informed by her research across a cast taken from a skull , ( pictured left ) while examining extra bones and teeth give her more of an idea of the creature ’s stature so that she can make models of early homids such as @entity188 ( right ) who lived 2.5million years ago ms @entity19 and her team make computer models of the skulls using 18 data points on the bone , which gives her an idea of muscles , the shape of a hominid 's nose , forehead and chin			1
she can then use these details to construct her model ( pictured ) once the clay sculpture is complete , a silicone cast is made , onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted , such as veins , wrinkles and spots			2
eye prosthetics give the eerily realistic stare and dental prosthetics the sculptures ’ toothy grins			0
it can be difficult to decide on exact details such as eye and hair colour , so ms @entity117 references scientific literature , which reveals that @entity232 had red hair , among other findings			1
‘ following the same approach as in a forensic investigation , i use the clues i find on the fossil to create an id of the subject : fossil group , dating , age at death , probable sex , diseases , deficiencies , dietary pattern , associated fauna , climate , living conditions , environment , culture , etc. ‘ i collect all these data in long discussions with experts , palaeopathologists , anthropologists and anatomists , to guide the decisions i make at each step of the reconstruction process , and to make sure my creations take into account the latest scientific developments			0
ms @entity19 uses human hair for members of the @entity29 genus , but mixes in yak hair for earlier hominds , as their hair is thought to have been much thicker and coarser			1
a model of one of the first specimens of @entity29 , dubbed @entity274 is pictured , who lived between 700,000 and 200,000 years ago ' i always follow the same rigorous two - step protocol : first , i focus on highlighting the general features of the fossil group to which the skull belongs ; then i reveal the particular traits of the subject , ' the sculptor said			0
an early stage model of 1.5million - year - old ' turkana boy ' - the most complete early human skeleton - is pictured ‘ finally , i painstakingly implant the hair , beard , and body hair one by one			2
’ ms @entity19 uses human hair for members of the @entity29 genus , but mixes in yak hair for earlier hominids , as their hair is thought to have been much thicker and coarser			1
she said that every model is the ‘ synthesis of all the knowledge on the origins of humankind ’			1
‘ what i try to do is to provide an opportunity for the general public to come face to face with beings millions of years away from them , an encounter with a different kind of humanity			2
’ she works particularly hard on giving the models a gaze by adding wrinkles of expression and putting shade and light into the eyes until the subject is animated with emotion			0
once the clay sculpture is complete , a silicone cast is made , onto which all the tiny details can be painstakingly painted , such as veins , wrinkles and spots			0
eye prosthetics give the eerily realistic stare and dental prosthetics the sculptures ' toothy grins			0
a storeroom of casts made of the models is pictured ms @entity19 believes that prehistoric humans are too often associated with brutality , but she tries to capture their humanity			1
and it can be hard for her to say goodbye to her creations , which typically take months to make			0
‘ i spend so much time with those creatures , sharing such a close relationship with their bodies and faces that i tend to find them beautiful , ’ she said			0
‘ a reconstruction project makes me enter into a relationship that resembles an act of love			0
when my sculptures go to a museum or an exhibition venue , i miss them acutely			0
i feel anxious for them and hope they are treated well			0

@entity122 uses clay and silicone to make the models
she aims to give distant beings their face , identity and humanity back , from her @entity96 studio , where she has worked for around 20 years
she starts by examining a specimen ’s skull , then makes a computer model to inform how *muscular* the face should look
ms @entity19 references scientific literature to decide on small details such as eye colour and uses a mixture of human and yak hair for hominids
she says that every model is the ‘ synthesis of all the knowledge on the origins of humankind ’ and misses them when they are in museums
