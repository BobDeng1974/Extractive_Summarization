' when they arrived at the reception centre and started to tell us what had happened to them , we were shocked by what we were hearing			0
' they lived in cramped conditions , with just a mattress on the floor to sleep on , and were only receiving a fraction of what they were actually earning - around £ 15 to £ 25 for a full working week			1
' meanwhile , the @entity4 family were driving around in high - value cars			0
the traffickers kept the men ’s documents so they had no way of leaving			2

' we were also told of a man who had suffered constant earache but was denied medical treatment			0
' to end the pain he was in , he perforated his own ear drum			0
' another victim told us how over several months he had managed to save about £ 55 , which he intended to use to escape and buy a flight home			2
' he returned from working one day to find his room had been searched and the money had been stolen			2
' @entity229 chief executive @entity297 added : ' this was a shocking example of people driven by nothing but greed lining their pockets at the expense of the health , welfare and safety of men who were forced to work for them			2
' it may shock the people of @entity36 to learn that the horrific practice of human trafficking is happening in their city			0
regrettably , it comes as no surprise to the @entity229 because we know this can and does happen everywhere			0
' the kind of organised criminal scam being operated by these two couples is typical of cases we are uncovering on a regular basis across the country			0
' we will continue to work in partnership with the police , the @entity228 and all other relevant organisations to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable people and make sure offenders are convicted just like they were in this case			0
