by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 : 08:18 est , 25 november 2013 a @entity4 family who claim their daughter was shot dead by her sheriff 's deputy boyfriend in a domestic violence dispute are demanding justice			1
young mother @entity10 , 24 , from @entity11 , was found dead of a gunshot wound to the mouth in september 2010 with her boyfriend , @entity16 ' duty weapon by her side			1
he claimed to have been in another room and that she took her own life			0
but miss @entity10 's family are convinced she was murdered and that mr @entity16 ' police colleagues helped him cover up his involvement			1
justice : young mother @entity10 , 24 , pictured , from @entity11 , was found dead of a gunshot wound to the mouth in september 2010 with her boyfriend , @entity16 ' duty weapon by her side their demands for a proper investigation into her death has now come to global attention as a result of a lengthy investigation by the @entity35			1
it found that after mr @entity16 told his colleagues his version of events - that miss @entity10 had broken up with him and taken her own life - the @entity38 sheriff 's department effectively halted their investigation			1
no evidence was tested , no family or neighbors were interviewed and no data was downloaded from mr @entity16 ' cellphone despite the fact that miss @entity10 had shown no signs of being suicidal prior to her death			1
her family told the paper that miss @entity10 had been excited about a new full time job at a day care center and was enjoying being a mother to her 4 - year - old daughter @entity55 more than ever			2
but hours before the shooting she had made the startling confession to her sister , @entity58 , that mr @entity16 had been violent towards her for months			1
she added that she wanted to leave him but was scared of how he would react if she did			0
but mr @entity16 ' colleagues at the sheriff 's office were n't interested in @entity58 's testimony - the only thing mr @entity16 was reprimanded for was not securing his service weapon when he got home			1
after months of pressure sheriff @entity67 finally asked @entity68 to re-examine the case			0
an investigation led by @entity71 found two neighbors who heard an argument that night and a woman screaming for help before gunshots and then silence			2
free : after mr @entity16 , pictured , gave his colleagues his account - ms @entity10 had broken up with him and was packing to move out when she shot herself - the @entity38 sheriff 's department all but wrapped up their investigation the women were submitted to polygraph lie - detector tests and passed			1
the results meant that state investigators , and the crime reconstruction expert they hired , were all convinced the sheriff 's department botched the original investigation and that miss @entity10 's death was a murder and not suicide			1
mr @entity16 told the investigators that the couple were at a concert on the of miss @entity10 's death and that she told him on the drive home she was leaving him			1
he said they argued briefly in the car and then ' we got to the house , we were fine			0
' according to him she went into another room to pack her belongings and then moments later he heard a pop. but neighbors @entity102 and @entity104 , who were not approached by the sheriff 's department , told the state investigators a different story			1
in separate interviews , they each said they were smoking cigarettes in miss @entity102 's open garage when they heard arguing and walked down the driveway to hear what was being said			0
miss @entity102 described how she heard a man and woman screaming and said she knew ' there was something wrong			0
' she added : ' there was nothing playful , no nothing			0
it was somebody that was scared			0
' they then heard a woman shout out ' help , ' a gun shot and then ' help ' again and another gun shot			0
after that , there was silence			0
their account prompted the medical examiner dr. @entity131 to change his ruling from suicide to homicide			2
the investigators in february 2011 also examined the forensic evidence that was taken from the crime scene but never tested for fingerprints , dna or gunshot residue			2
they found that there was no blood found on the gun , nor did it have any dna or fingerprints from mr @entity16 , which is surprising given he 'd worn it on his belt on his previous shift			1
the lab also detected two spots of ms @entity10 's blood on the inside of mr @entity16 ' t - shirt which casts doubt over his claim that he was in a different room when his girlfriend died			1
the state investigators ' also questioned how the young woman came to have a bleeding cut above eye - a crime scene reconstructionist claimed the cut had occurred before the fatal shot , a defensive wound that indicated a struggle			2
but just as it appeared likely that charges would be brought , the local state attorney jolted the investigation , citing his close relationship to the sheriff , mr @entity16 ' boss			1
happy : rather than acting suicidal leading up to her death , ms @entity173 was excited about a new full time job at a day care center and enjoying her 4 - year - old daughter @entity55 more than ever , her family a new medical examiner was appointed before the previous one officially changed his ruling from suicide to homicide			2
the new one backed the sheriff 's original determination of suicide and claimed the bruise above ms @entity10 's eye was caused by a tactical light on the gun			1
three experts told the @entity35 investigation that they did n't believe this was physically possible			0
finally , the case went to special prosecutor @entity194 who in march 2012 said he was n't going to prosecute @entity16			2
' the day my family met with @entity194 i refer to as the second - worst day of my life , ' @entity58 said , ' losing my sister was the worst			0
' the state investigators were so unhappy they called for a special inquest and the re-constructionist claims the prosecutor who came to talk to him seemed to be intent on confirming the ruling of suicide rather than re-examining the case			0
he said : ' the whole tone of the interview was for me to tailor my report or soften my report to where it would be more conducive to suicide rather than homicide			0
' the memo explaining his decision said the testimony of the two witnesses who heard shouts and gunfire did not ' support any type of homicide conviction on its own			0
' in the end the prosecutor rejected the call for an inquest , a decision which was greeted with gushing praise by the sheriff effectively closed the case			0
however , when the newspaper started asking questions a year later he launched an inquiry into the state agency 's investigation , alleging misconduct on behalf of the investigators			2
in march a report was released a report which claimed the second set of investigators hyped up their case against mr @entity16 and coached witnesses			1
the report also claimed that the two witnesses had confessed they often smoked marijuana together and could n't remember if they had done so that night even though the women said this was categorically not true			0
three years later , @entity10 's mother , sisters and brother continue to believe she did n't kill herself			2
@entity254 added : ' it 's unfair to my sister , to her memory , to her daughter and to my family , i still am hopeful that eventually , it may be 20 years , but eventually , we will have justice for my sister and for her daughter			0

@entity10 , 24 , from @entity11 , @entity4 died from a gunshot wound to the mouth in september 2010
a weapon belonging to her boyfriend , deputy sheriff @entity16 , was found by her side
the sheriff 's office ruled it was suicide based on mr @entity16 ' account but a *subsequent* investigation by state police found it was murder
they found the sheriff 's office failed to test any evidence , interview family and neighbors or download data from mr @entity16 ' cellphone
