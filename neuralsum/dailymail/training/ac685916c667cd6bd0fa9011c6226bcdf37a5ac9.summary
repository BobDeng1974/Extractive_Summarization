@entity37 ’s refusal to co-operate also meant her mental health was never assessed			0
mr @entity57 said the deaths were not foreseeable but concluded : ‘ if the children had been placed into care this could have avoided this tragic outcome			1
’ @entity37 was seen wandering around @entity66 in @entity78 clutching a teddy bear for 90 minutes on april 15 last year before jumping to her death			1

‘ she felt unable to cope with the situation and apologetically outlined her intention to take the children with her , ’ he said			0
‘ in her words : “ a mother never abandons her children ”			2
’ coroner dr @entity166 said : ‘ it seems there were missed opportunities to engage with a non-engaging family			0
‘ it was perhaps wise , instead of doing the same thing for 18 months , to stop what you ’re doing and see if there is a different way			0
’ dr @entity166 said he did n’t want to ‘ imply liability ’ , but ‘ the required steps were not approached to psychologically assess ’ @entity37			0

‘ it ’s clear – through her abnormal perception of her circumstances and her subsequent actions of what she thought was in their best interests at the time – the need to help these families and spot psychological and behaviour problems			0
she was clearly a social and psychological risk and what she did was extreme			0
’ the coroner said he would write to health minister @entity219 about the case because it highlighted the need for more awareness of parents with mental health issues and how to provide support for them			0
