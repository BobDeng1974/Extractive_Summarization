@entity2 's beard became the most controversial facial hair in all of @entity4 , but now critics who accused him of looking like a member of the @entity7 can rest easy - he has shaved			1
grown in order to mark the time his son was in captivity as a pow in @entity16 , neighbors of @entity2 in @entity9 , @entity10 , have said that the former @entity18 truck driver is now clean shaven			1
this comes as it was reported that @entity22 is still refusing to speak to his family , despite being sent a letter from his sister , as he recovers in an @entity27 hospital in @entity28			2
indeed , despite sharpening up his look , from the moment the father of @entity22 took the stage with president @entity49 in the @entity32 last month it was clear the @entity2 's were no average @entity4 military family			1
with his long unkempt beard , seemingly anti-government sentiment and an apparent obsession with @entity16 culture and language , @entity2 infuriated many with his use of both @entity58 and @entity60 language to thank @entity61 in front of the president at the @entity64			1
even though @entity2 says he changed his appearance to better understand the @entity7 who had captured his son , his appropriation of their culture has struck some critics as too close for comfort			1
bearded still : @entity31 and @entity2 , the parents of @entity27 sgt. @entity22 , speak during a press conference at @entity75 on sunday , june 1 , 2014 , in @entity76 , @entity10 on their return to their home state marking time with his beard : @entity2 , the father of an @entity4 soldier said he was proud of how far his son , sgt. @entity22 , was willing to go to help the @entity16 people at a press conference in @entity10 earlier this month the hosts of @entity85 and @entity86 in particular were infuriated at @entity87 and his actions			1
co-host @entity90 criticized @entity22 's father for a controversial tweet he sent and later deleted to a @entity7 spokesperson , ' i am still working to free all @entity44 prisoners			1
@entity95 will repay for the death of every @entity16 child , ameen			0
' this made @entity90 furious , ' i mean , he says he was growing his beard because his son was in captivity			2
well , your son 's out now			1
so if you really do n't - no longer look like a member of the @entity7 , you do n't have to look like a member of the @entity7			2
are you out of razors ? ' the sight of @entity2 standing with the president did shock many @entity4 unused to his facial hair , which bore some similarities to that grown by devotees of @entity112			1
however , what shocked them more was his use of @entity58 and @entity60			1
introduced by the president , @entity2 spoke mostly @entity117 , but his rudimentary knowledge of @entity120 languages shocked			1
' i 'd like to say to @entity22 right now , who 's having trouble speaking @entity117 , bismillah @entity121 , ' he said			2
' i 'm your father @entity22			2
the people of @entity16 , the same			0
' to everyone who effected this ... throughout the whole of @entity4 government and international governments around the world , thank you so much			0
' ready to go home : sgt. @entity22 , sits in a vehicle guarded by the @entity7 in eastern @entity16 when he was freed by the @entity7 on may 31 , 2014 , in exchange for five @entity16 detainees held in the @entity4 prison at @entity141 , @entity142 facial hair : @entity2 and @entity144 , the parents of captive @entity27 sgt. @entity22 , hold hands as they pray at the @entity148 celebration held to honor sgt. @entity2 in @entity9 , @entity10 last year the @entity60 phrase bismillah @entity121 appears prominently in the @entity150 and means ' in the name of @entity61 , the @entity152 , the @entity153 '			1
according to @entity154 , senior @entity155 correspondent for conservative news network @entity156 , the @entity7 was thrilled to hear and see the press conference			2
others , however , said there was nothing so sinister in the former @entity18 delivery man 's speech			0
after his son was captured by the @entity7 in june 2009 , mr @entity2 said he immersed himself in the language and culture of @entity16 chiefly so he could understand the captors , and speak to them from afar			1
he said in a previous interview : ' i 'm trying to learn a little @entity58 so that i can speak to people ... i 'm trying to write or read the language			0
' i probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history			0
' @entity174 , a @entity2 family friend , added to @entity175 : ' would n't you try and connect with the people that had your child ? ' @entity2 and @entity31 did everything possible they could to ensure @entity22 's safety			1
and if @entity2 was trying to connect with them , it was to keep his son safe , i 'm sure			2
' accompanied by president @entity49 , @entity144 and @entity2 speak during a news conference in the @entity32 of the @entity64 in @entity155 on saturday , may 31 , 2014 about the release of their son , @entity27 sgt. @entity22 as their son recovers , @entity2 and mrs @entity190 have kept out of the public eye after getting several death threats			1
officials wo n't describe the nature of the threats , but acknowledge that threats have been made			0
the @entity2 have not been seen publicly since announcing with president @entity49 that their son had been freed			2
' we are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously , ' @entity36 special agent @entity200 told @entity175 in an e-mail on saturday			0
the threats come in the wake of controversy coming from the families of soldiers who were killed while supposedly looking for @entity2 , who is said to have deserted his post , which is what led to his capture by @entity7 forces in 2009			1
in the past , @entity2 described a prisoner swap as a ‘ win - win ’ situation as he would get his son back and the @entity4 would improve relations with the @entity16			2
he has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and @entity44			0
in a video posted by the @entity223 newspaper , @entity2 told photographer @entity224 : ' i do n't work for the military			0
i do n't work for the government			0
i do n't represent the @entity4 people			0
i 'm a father who wants his son back			0
' some activists have picked up on other tweets from @entity2 , as well			0
in march , he wrote , ' ‘ democracy ’ is a cult in the @entity233 ' in response to a comment about the @entity16 elections			0
he also raised eyebrows when , in a press conference , he said the family 's hometown of @entity9 , @entity10 , ' we 're so much like @entity16			1
' @entity243 also got criticism for this tweet , in which he called democracy a ' cult ' idyllic ? this is the beautiful homestead of @entity2 and @entity144 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the @entity250 hope @entity22 will return here to a hero 's welcome			2
but what were the circumstances of his release ? in a 2011 video message to @entity22 's captors , @entity2 said : ' strangely to some we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years			1
' we know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home			0
' @entity22 ’s brother - in - law spoke to @entity266 and what he said chimed with @entity269 ’s comments			2
he denied that the @entity2 family had sympathies with the @entity7 and said that there was a ‘ deeper story ’ to emerge			1
@entity274 , a @entity4 navy pilot married to @entity22 ’s sister @entity276 said it was ‘ rubbish ’ that @entity2 had any loyalties to the @entity7 or @entity112			1
‘ it makes no logical sense , ’ said @entity274 , 38 , wearing his @entity280 uniform complete with a badge of the @entity282 , the elite fighter squadron			0
‘ he has no sympathies with the @entity7			0
just because he speaks a few words of @entity58			0
‘ there are guys on my base that do that			0
you would n’t accuse them of having sympathies			0
’ initial euphoria over the release of @entity297 , 28 , @entity4 ’s only prisoner of war in @entity16 , after five years has led to a growing backlash .			0
