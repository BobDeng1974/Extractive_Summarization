fit for royalty : @entity1 with her @entity3 award for best actress for her portrayal as @entity6 in @entity7 @entity1 , who won an @entity3 for her screen portrait of the @entity7 , has revealed , exclusively , that she will play the monarch again — this time on the @entity11 stage			1
@entity1 will star in a play that exposes some unlikely alliances between the @entity7 and a few of her 12 prime ministers , who stretch from @entity16 all the way back to @entity18			1
called @entity19 , the play — which is bound to be one of the hottest tickets in town in years — will begin preview performances at the @entity25 on february 15 , with an official opening night tentatively marked for march 5			1
producer @entity27 told me it ’s scheduled to run to june 15			2
next week , during a short break from shooting the thriller @entity32 with @entity33 , @entity1 will travel from @entity34 to @entity35 to liaise with the play ’s creative team			1
she will meet with director @entity38 , writer @entity39 ( who penned the 2006 film @entity7 ) and designer @entity41 , and do a second read - through of the play			1
they will also discuss how best to deal with the age range — the actress , 67 , will portray the @entity7 from the time she acceded to the throne , aged 25 , through to her 80s			1
‘ that ’ll be a challenge , ’ she said drily			0
however , @entity1 observed the @entity7 ’s ‘ unbelievable consistency in everything ’ — from dress to hairstyle to professional attitude — made the age problem not as insurmountable as it might seem			1
‘ her voice has changed , and i can use that — she had a terribly posh voice when she was young , ’ @entity1 said , skilfully mimicking the youthful @entity7 ’s cut - glass received pronunciation			1
‘ but now even the @entity7 , while she is n’t quite dropping the ends of her lines — though her grandsons do ! — there ’s a tiny bit of estuary creeping in there			1
i can use all that to signify the age range , and we ’ll come up with other things			0
’ @entity1 told me that when @entity39 initially emailed her about doing the @entity19 , she was n’t wild about the idea , and shot back a salty message that started : ‘ @entity78 ! ’ ‘ i certainly do n’t want to be known as the actress who played the @entity7 , so there was a slight sense of apprehension about that element , ’ she told me			1
by the time she turned up for a reading of the audience back in june , she said she ’d made up her mind to turn the project down			0
‘ i was thinking : “ you should n’t really be doing this , @entity1			1
i do n’t think it ’s right			0
” and the thought of doing a play — you ca n’t go anywhere for six months ! ’ but then she walked into the room and saw @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity41 and producers @entity27 , @entity97 and @entity98 ( one of the producers of @entity7 ) — and had a change of heart			1
class act : @entity1 as her majesty in @entity7 alongside @entity103 as @entity104 winning performance : @entity1 portraying the @entity7 reading anout the death of princess @entity108 in the 2005 film ‘ i thought : “ here are some of the best people at what they do in the world			1
if you do n’t do it , you ’re an absolute idiot ! ” so here we go again			0
’ she revealed that the play is about the history of @entity119 as much as it is about the relationships between her majesty and her prime ministers			0
‘ i think it ’s about what power means and how people handle it			0
not the @entity7 , incidentally , because she is comparatively powerless			2
but how power is held in the hands of these men — and one woman — and the effect that has on their personalities and their psyche			0
‘ in the beginning , the @entity7 is the young , nervous , unknowledgeable one			2
‘ but as she progresses through them , they become the nervous ones			0
she ’s the one constant , through a revolving door of prime ministers			0
’ historical : @entity1 staring as the first @entity142 in the channel 4 series @entity143 in 2005 versatile : @entity1 is currently filming the sequel to the 2010 comedy thriller film red @entity39 is working on a new draft of the @entity19 and , for now , no one knows exactly which prime ministers will be showcased			1
@entity104 did n’t appear in the first draft , but he may take a bow in the new version that @entity1 will read next week			2
‘ she was a very young woman with @entity18 , who was trying to bamboozle and then educate her ; and she has gotten on better with some than she has with others , ’ producer @entity27 told me			0
he added that people may find it ‘ surprising who she gets on well with ’			0
he said @entity39 conducted extremely thorough research , talking to assorted @entity39 ’s principal private secretaries and cabinet ministers			0
@entity162 had been ‘ very helpful ’ , he said			0
meanwhile , @entity1 and her fellow stars from @entity32 will be in town filming over the next few weeks			2
‘ we ’ll be shooting up @entity35 , ’ @entity1 joked			2
‘ what a contrast of characters : from retired assassin to @entity7 ! ’			2

@entity1 will take up the role of @entity6 again - but this time on stage
the talented actress will portray the @entity7 from the time she acceded to the throne , aged 25 , through to her 80s
the @entity19 will begin preview performances at the @entity25 on february 15
