by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 05:04 est , 14 october 2013 whistles , the high - street brand beloved of the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 among others , is to launch its own range of menswear			1
a new design team has been hired to work under @entity6 design director @entity10 on the new range which will make its first appearance in stores next autumn			0
speaking of the decision to launch a new range of menswear , @entity6 ceo @entity14 told @entity19 's website : ' we have defined our aesthetic , and achieved a consistency in our design			1
' famous fans : @entity25 of @entity26 and @entity4 have both been photographed in @entity6 royal fans in the making ? the @entity26 and prince @entity29 can now join the @entity6 fan club too she continued : ' menswear is something that we have been planning to do since we started in 2008			1
we recognise that , as with womenswear , there is considerable expansion in the contemporary middle market , this is an ideal time to capitalise on this opportunity and bring the @entity6 aesthetic to menswear			1
’ the collection will be available online and in key whistles stores , as well as some luxury department stores			0
whistles started life in 1978 as an independent boutique and has since evolved into a leading womenswear brand , characterised by a contemporary , intelligent sense of style and design			0
the brand , which already has outlets in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , is currently in discussion with a large @entity60 department store about opening a concession next spring			0
and after making a well - received debut on the @entity65 catwalk last february , @entity6 ' expansion shows no sign of slowing down - helped along by a glamorous army of high profile fans			1
royal approval : @entity25 of @entity26 at the @entity71 in @entity6 - the woman behind is also in @entity6 winning look : @entity3 wore the brand to watch boyfriend @entity74 take gold at the @entity71 last year @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity74 's girlfriend @entity3 , and prime minister @entity76 's wife @entity4 are staunch supporters of the brand , although @entity14 herself cites gamine director @entity79 as her muse , and ' go - to woman for inspiration '			1
nevertheless , the former @entity2 and her sister @entity82 both have wardrobes full of @entity6 clothes , and the @entity2 is not afraid to show her thrifty side by recycling them			2
last summer the @entity2 wore the £ 150 blue @entity88 dress to both the @entity89 and the @entity90			2
despite the dress - and every other piece @entity2 wears - selling out moments after she was spotted in it , @entity14 denies the so - called ' @entity2 effect ' has boosted sales			2
speaking in 2012 , she said : ' it raises profile , it ’s great , we get known in countries we 're not known in			0
' but it 's not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it			0
fortunately , she looks great in it and it 's a great advert , but no more than that			0
