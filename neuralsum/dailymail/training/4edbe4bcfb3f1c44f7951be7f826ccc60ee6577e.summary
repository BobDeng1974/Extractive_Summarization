the meaning behind a ' moo ' may have been solved by scientists , who have recorded and analysed the way cows communicate			0
@entity6 researchers found cows make two very distinct calls when they talk to their calves , depending on the distance between them			1
they also identified a specific call a calf makes to its mother when its wants to start suckling			1
cows and their calves communicate using calls that are individualised in a similar way to human names			1
the team studied two herds of free - range cattle on a farm in @entity24			2
recordings were made using highly sensitive audio equipment the team spent 10 months studying the ways cows talked to their young to discover cows make maternal low sounds when a mother is close to her calf			1
the louder , higher pitched calls are reserved for when a calf is out of visual contact			0
meanwhile , calves make a specific call when they want milk			1
but , the most important finding was that all three calls were individualised in a similar way to human names			2
lead scientist dr @entity42 , from the @entity43 , said : ' the research shows for the first time that mother - offspring cattle ' calls ' are individualised - each calf and cow have a characteristic and exclusive call of their own			1

the louder , higher pitched calls are reserved for when a calf is out of visual contact			0
meanwhile , calves make a specific call when they want milk ' @entity63 also reveals that certain information is conveyed within the calf calls - age , but not gender			1

recordings were made using highly sensitive equipment that gathered enough data to study for a year			0
low frequency calls - these are produced by cows when they are close to their calves , usually a few weeks after birth			1
louder high frequency calls - the louder calls are made when cows are separated from their calves , after nursing , and not in visual contact			1
calf calls - these calls are created when calves are separated from their mothers and want to suckle milk			2
further work may reveal vocal indicators of well - being or distress in cows which could influence animal care policies , say the researchers co-author dr @entity99 , from @entity100 , said : ' this is the first time that complex cattle calls have been analysed using the latest and best techniques			2
' our results provide an excellent foundation for investigating vocal indicators of cattle welfare			0
' farmer @entity110 , who has been around cows since the 1950s , told the @entity112 that the research supports what he has always noticed himself			0
' a calf certainly knows its mother from other cows , and when a calf [ calls ] the mother knows it 's her calf , ' said mr @entity110 , who is a farmer in @entity120			2
' if they are not distressed , and they are calm , they will moo fairly low to the calf , almost talking to their calf			0
' co-author dr @entity99 said : ' this is the first time complex cattle calls have been analysed using the latest and best techniques			0

' further work may reveal vocal signs of distress in cows which could influence animal care			0

@entity43 team spent 10 months studying the ways cows talk
they found cows make two distinct calls based on distance between them
team also discovered calves make a specific call when they want milk
study shows for first time that mother - offspring ' calls ' are individualised
