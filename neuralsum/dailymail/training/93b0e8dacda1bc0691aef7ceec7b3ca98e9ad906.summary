by @entity0 published : 02:33 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 23 may 2013 @entity2 golf star @entity1 is facing losses running into millions after his biggest sponsor threatened to dump him last night in the wake of race comments he made about @entity8			1
asked light - heartedly whether he would be inviting @entity8 round for dinner at the @entity11 next month , @entity1 said : ‘ every night — and serving him fried chicken			1
’ the @entity14 showed genuine remorse yesterday for an attempt at humour that went horriblywrong at a players ’ awards dinner on tuesday night			1
but his abject apology for a remark that carries racist overtones — fried chicken is stereotypically a food associated with @entity25 — might not save his £ 5million - a - year deal with @entity27			1
a company statement said : ‘ @entity1 ’s comment was offensive and in no way aligns with our values and corporate culture			2
we discussed with @entity1 that his comments are clearly out of bounds and we are continuing to review the matter			2
’ the inference is clear			0
if it dominates the golfing news agenda in the @entity51 for any length of time , he will be history			0
woods wasted no time in tweeting his horror that his long - running feud with @entity1 had stooped so low			1
‘ the comment that was made was n’t silly			0
it was wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate , ’ said the world no 1 , who added : ‘ i am confident there was real regret that the remark was made			0
’ response : woods took to @entity32 to hit back at claims that @entity1 's comments were just ' silly ' he said what ? @entity1 ( left ) said he would ' serve @entity8 fried chicken ' and later apologised @entity71 stars : @entity1 's @entity73 team - mates @entity74 ( centre ) and @entity76 were also on stage remarkably , given @entity1 ’s actions have overshadowed their flagship event — the @entity81 at @entity82 , which begins on thursday — the @entity78 said they considered the matter closed			1
a crestfallen @entity1 said : ‘ to @entity8 , i say i am truly sorry and that i feel sick about it			1
my answer was stupid and out of place and i ca n’t say sorry enough about that			0
' i was n’t able to sleep at all last night			2
i wish i did n’t do it but the only thing i can do is apologise			0
’ @entity1 , who admitted he had thought about pulling out of the event , is due on the first tee in the company of defending champion @entity74 and his fellow @entity14 @entity94			1
teeing off : @entity1 during the pro-am round on the @entity96 at @entity82 he added : ' i was caught off guard by the question and understand the answer was totally stupid			2
i ca n't say sorry enough			0
' i 'd like to say sorry to the @entity78 and my @entity73 team - mates for taking the shine away from a wonderful awards dinner			2
' asked if he will call @entity103 to reconcile with the world no 1 , @entity1 said : ' i do n't have his number but i called his manager and left a message			1
' i 'd love to talk as soon as possible and say how sorry i am			0
i want to apologise face to face and hopefully move on			0
' it was not meant as a racist comment			0
it seemed to be a funny question and i tried to give a funny answer			0
it came out the wrong way			0
' through the years : @entity1 ( right ) and @entity8 together in their younger days ( above and below ) happier times : at one stage @entity1 looked to be a major rival before @entity8 went on to dominate the sport the two players have clashed on many occasions in the past			1
the long - running feud raised its head again at the @entity126 at @entity127 a fortnight ago			2
the root of their mutual antipathy goes all the way back to 1999			0
the pair were duelling for the @entity51 @entity133 and the teenage @entity1 had the temerity to point across the course at @entity8 , as if to challenge him			1
twelve months later , the @entity8 tail was tweaked again when @entity1 celebrated loudly after beating him in an exhibition match			1
since then , it has been all @entity103 , with the @entity51 winning 14 majors and @entity1 none , but some of the old @entity1 swagger certainly seems to have made a reappearance lately .			2

@entity1 was asked if he would invite @entity8 for dinner during @entity11
he replied : ' every night - and serving him fried chicken '
meal is stereotypically a food associated with @entity25
@entity14 apologises , but may still lose *lucrative* deal with @entity27
