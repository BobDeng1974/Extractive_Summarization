so @entity0 continue to fly @entity2 ’s flag in @entity3 and there is no sense they are ready for this adventure to end			2
this has been a hugely frustrating domestic campaign , one in which @entity0 have lurched to the brink of calamity			2
but the @entity12 has provided excitement and opportunity and did so again , with @entity0 now 90 minutes away from the last eight			2
true , it will be difficult to get there			2
allowing @entity18 to score an away goal means @entity0 will require a performance of strength and discipline in @entity23 next week but at least they can travel with confidence thanks to @entity26 ’s 82nd - minute penalty			1
@entity26 celebrates his late penalty which gives @entity0 a precious lead ahead of next week 's return leg in the @entity23 capital after a long wait , a nervy @entity26 put the ball to @entity34 's left and his penalty just about beat the keeper to nestle in the net @entity38 celebrates his leveller as the @entity41 's instinctive finish restored parity before the break after great work from @entity26 @entity38 coolly slips the ball beyong the onrushing @entity34 to raise the roof at an expectant @entity46 @entity47 slips away from @entity48 on the far post , darts toward the near post and connects with a corner to steer past @entity53 @entity47 wheels away in jubilation after giving the visitors the lead to give @entity0 fans plenty to think about on a nervy @entity3 night @entity26 reacts after squandering a chance to put @entity0 ahead , but the club 's £ 28m record signing made amends later with his spot kick @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity53 6 : @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 8 , @entity67 7 : @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 7 : @entity38 7.5 , @entity48 6 ( @entity70 74 , 6 ) , @entity71 6 ( @entity72 64 , 6 ) : @entity26 7 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			1

on a filthy night when the rain tumbled relentlessly , it would have been easy for them to buckle			2
as it was , they kept going			2
there were excellent performances , not least from captain @entity66 and @entity69 , and there was also courage , not least from @entity26			1
his seventh @entity3 goal of the campaign may just be the one @entity81 needs to turn things around			2
‘ it has to be a turning point , ’ said the @entity0 manager			2
‘ our fans know that we have got an honest group of players			2
when we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play , we have shown that we are a good team			2
‘ you can not underestimate how important it is to win in @entity3			2
our intensity was very pleasing			0
that was us at our best level			0
we know we have a good side			0
’ usually for such contests , there is a crackle of anticipation around @entity46 but things were markedly different			0
@entity0 ’s dreadful form through a bleak midwinter has left many fans sceptical and miserable performances have sapped their energy			0
a positive start would have quelled anxieties but @entity0 , playing in all blue on orders from @entity159 to avoid a clash with @entity18 , were sluggish and horribly short of confidence			0
no one was prepared to take charge or provide a run to open gaps for others			0
sensing they could profit , @entity18 began to venture forward with increased purpose , and after 14 minutes they inflicted the kind of blow that @entity81 had spoken of with dread in the build - up , a goal to complicate an already difficult task			0
in many ways , it highlighted @entity0 ’s current ills			0
@entity92 flung in a corner , @entity68 was too slow to react and @entity47 nipped in to direct a volley into the roof of the @entity181 net			1
standing on the touchline in the downpour , @entity81 looked shell - shocked			0
when @entity88 then tested @entity53 with a shot from 20 yards that skidded off the greasy surface , the groans were becoming louder and there was a definite sense that rebellion was in the air			0
@entity38 finished off some wonderful work from @entity26 to give @entity0 a foothold in the game			1
check out more from @entity195 @entity26 shows a clean pair of heels to @entity85 as the @entity0 frontman begins another attack for the home hopefuls @entity26 fires in a free - kick but the big @entity202 failed to trouble the scoresheet on this occasion the @entity18 wall jumps in unison as @entity26 's fizzing effort sails past the men in white and out for a corner then , from nowhere , @entity0 started to play			1
‘ we gave a cheap goal away but i could not be more proud of our reaction , ’ said @entity81			0
the momentum shifted when @entity66 charged down a loose ball and surged upfield , passing to @entity26 with @entity18 keeper @entity34 stranded outside his area			1
had @entity26 returned the pass , @entity66 would have had an open goal to aim at but instead the @entity202 shot horribly wide			1
@entity0 had a spark and in the next attack , after 37 minutes , @entity67 ’s inswinging corner was met flush by @entity66 but the @entity2 defender ’s header was cleared from under the bar by @entity85			1
@entity65 then smashed the rebound over the bar			0
@entity69 leapfrogs @entity88 as the veteran midfielder battles for possession in the @entity0 engine room @entity71 and @entity85 battle for the ball during a gritty encounter on @entity234 which leaves @entity0 neatly poised to progress @entity26 terrorises three @entity18 players as the @entity0 talisman attempts to showcase his attacking prowess this was a significant improvement and soon @entity0 were level			1
@entity26 can infuriate with his ability to make the wrong call but his play to create the equaliser for @entity38 was outstanding , bull - dozing his way past three challenges before slipping in the @entity41 , whose finish was admirably cool			1
as he wheeled away to celebrate , @entity38 made a point of signalling to @entity66 and for good reason			1
he had played a captain ’s role , taking the game by the scruff of the neck and driving his team forward			0
half - time came but it did not check @entity0 ’s impetus			0
they came out of the blocks for the second period with purpose and @entity26 ’s hulking presence continually unsettled @entity85 and forced him to make mistakes			1
one such error led to a corner from which @entity38 almost scored with a header			1
that @entity38 missed was not a problem			1
the mood around the stadium had completely changed			0
@entity0 looked dangerous every time they attacked and the suspicion was that @entity82 would buckle if they kept testing him , as the impressive @entity67 did with a fizzing free - kick			1
@entity67 lies on the sodden turf and winces as @entity0 's @entity12 campaign continued in sterling fashion @entity81 shares a moment with @entity102 as the former @entity280 and @entity281 striker made a losing return to @entity2 the travelling fans were in good humour and voice as the leaders of the @entity288 travelled to @entity234 en masse each raid forward attracted encouragement from the stands and aware of the difference the crowd could make , @entity26 urged them to keep making a noise			1
suddenly it felt like @entity0 could pinch a lead and so it proved with eight minutes remaining			0
when @entity85 handled substitute @entity70 ’s cross , referee @entity104 had no hesitation pointing to the spot			1
@entity26 did the rest , firing his penalty straight down the middle			1
@entity304 on may 27 , for the moment , remains an @entity306 said : ‘ the team reacted well after the first half			0
we should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top - class players			0
it ’s up there with my best performances			0
if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this			0

@entity47 broke the *deadlock* , slipping away from @entity48 and @entity68 to connect with a corner
@entity38 levelled before the break , finishing off a fine move from the impressive @entity26
substitute @entity70 won a penalty which was converted by @entity26 in the 82nd minute
@entity26 was a menace throughout and @entity113 struggled to contain him
the sides meet for the second leg in @entity113 next *thursday*
