but therein lies the problem , novelist @entity14 claimed yesterday			0
the best - selling writer , who has faced a backlash from ‘ @entity18 ’ following the release of her modern day version of @entity21 , said many of her critics would have found it ‘ very difficult ’ to read @entity6 ’s original work and will be basing their opinions on tv adaptations			1
citing the example of @entity29 playing mr @entity9 in the tv adaptation , she said : ‘ they [ @entity6 ] fans love @entity33 when @entity29 emerges from the lake in the wet shirt , which at no point features in the book			1
i ’m not saying there is n’t great accuracy in the films but it is n’t the same			0
’ miss @entity3 , 69 , was making her comments at @entity44 book club @entity43 where she explained how she had adapted the classic , @entity21 published in 1811 , by setting it in modern day society			0
the author told how she chose to reference social networking site @entity49 and used colloquialisms such as ‘ totes amaze - balls ’ from @entity53 reality - soap @entity52 is @entity54 to bring it into 2013			1
the mother - of - two said many of the @entity6 themes were transferable to the 21st century claiming many women are still driven by the sex appeal of money			1
miss @entity3 went on to joke that nobody ever had slept with @entity64 billionaire @entity63 for his looks or that @entity66 character @entity66 would not be as desirable if he was not as wealthy			0
miss @entity3 has written more than 30 novels but is best - known for her historical romance ‘ the @entity70 ’			1
she said : ‘ the one thing which @entity6 understood was the sex appeal of money , and that ’s a recurrence today			1
do you really think anyone went to bed with @entity63 for his good looks ? ‘ @entity66 would not have been an erotic best seller if @entity66 had had no money			0
if that novel had been set in a bedsit above a take - away in suburban @entity44 it would have been a novel about sexual abuse and that is why it works			0
’ defending her right to play around with the original miss @entity3 yesterday argued many fans found it ‘ very difficult ’ to read @entity6 and were more likely to watch the films			1
miss @entity3 ’s @entity21 was released in october and she said : ‘ people have to remember that i ’m not writing a sequel			2
the problem we have is , there is a generation who claim to absolutely love her – they think they are @entity6 fans but actually they know every frame of the films and the television			2
‘ the funny thing is people find @entity104 @entity103 very hard to read , therefore most ‘ fans ’ seek adaptations			2
‘ ‘ when i was writing i took a paperback and i cannibalised it , i went through with a highlighter pen and looked to see which dialogue i wanted to use			0
‘ and i managed to translate @entity6 to ‘ totes amazeballs ’ and if you sit and watch @entity112 the language is great so i had to have a play			1
’ iconic scene : mr @entity9 emerging from a lake in @entity117 s @entity33 is a scene many fans recall fondly @entity21 was first adapted for television in 1981in a serial directed by @entity122 then in 1995 it was made into film starring actress @entity124			0

miss @entity3 , who is twice divorced and lives alone in @entity44 , added : ‘ @entity139 are n’t really in the spirit of @entity6			2
‘ i think she may have looked at ‘ @entity142 ’ and gone – no god why			0
‘ there ’s a slightly quality street element to what has become the @entity6 legacy			1
‘ if you read her letters they are such fun , she ’s mad about clothes and what everything costs and what we are going to have for dinner – they are full of parties and gossip			2
‘ she was a hugely intelligent women but she was very much of her time			0
