for those looking for romance , a quick trip to the country may just be worth your while			0
a recent study has found that @entity7 's single hotspots are found in some rather unlikely locations			1
while you may think that @entity10 or @entity11 would be brimming with daters , it 's actually the little - known towns , such as @entity14 , @entity15 , or @entity16 , @entity17 that boast the highest number of active singles by population			1
would n't this make a lovely date spot ? @entity23 is in @entity14 , @entity15 , which is one of the @entity7 's singleton hotspots looking for love in @entity10 ? think again ! for the best chances at romance , try a smaller town , like @entity30 , @entity31 in fact , according to @entity33 , both towns have more than eight times as many daters per 1000 population than the capital			1
@entity68 , @entity69 @entity70 in @entity31 and @entity39 are also home to highly concentrated populations of singles			0
@entity33 managing director , @entity74 , says : ' although big cities have more singles in total , their greater populations mean that they are not as concentrated as in these small hotspots			2
' and it may just be worth a trip			0
though @entity14 , @entity15 , is not known for its nightlife , the small market town is famous for its historic buildings , such as @entity23 , and its cricketing heritage			2
the village , with a population of 2,266 , has the highest number of active daters in proportion to its population			1
keep an eye out for a potential mate while taking in the town 's quaint surroundings , which include a 1966 abbey church , used by the @entity99 nuns			0
for those in further @entity17 , it may be time to visit @entity16 in @entity17 ( population 16,832 ) and @entity39 in the @entity104			1
@entity39 , @entity106 's third most populous city , offers plenty of first date picks to suit any taste			0
from dolphin spotting excursions and scenic fishing village strolls to the contemporary @entity114 , the city is full of options for young workers who 've relocated for work			0
@entity16 in @entity17 also has a large percentage of daters			1
pictured : market cross @entity120 in @entity106 , @entity39 is home to many young adults looking for love - especially after so many oil industry workers have re-located to the city users in more than 500 towns and cities from across the @entity7 were analysed as part of the project			1
@entity74 added : ' some of these [ results ] are more easily explained than others			0
@entity39 , for example , has a number of workers who have re-located to the city due to its oil industry , and people in a new town may be more likely to use dating sites to find a partner or just meet some new people			2
' places such as @entity14 or @entity16 though are a bit more of a mystery			2
we can only assume that in smaller towns such as these , good news spreads fast , and that those who have found dates or met a partner through sites like @entity33 recommend their friends also try the service			0

@entity33 has found the @entity7 's single hotspots : @entity15 and @entity17
@entity14 *&* @entity16 have highest number of singles by population
@entity39 's *influx* of workers have also caused number of daters to spike
