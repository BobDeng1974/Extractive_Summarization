it was on @entity1 last year that @entity2 finally cracked after being substituted by @entity4 manager @entity3 at @entity5			1
he had done his utmost not to react and , placid by nature , there was no kicking water bottles , but he was visibly distraught despite the consolatory efforts of @entity11 behind him			0
fast forward 16 months and there was an altogether different kind of substitution in the 81st minute of last sunday 's @entity15			0
after scoring and inspiring @entity17 to 4 - 2 win , he received a standing ovation and a pat on the back from @entity22			1
@entity17 midfielder @entity2 turns away to celebrate after scoring against @entity23 @entity2 had scored @entity17 's third goal during the 4 - 2 victory over their bitter rivals at @entity27 last week @entity2 looks dejected after being substituted by @entity4 boss @entity3 last year at @entity28 although he had been a popular figure at @entity4 , @entity2 could not convince @entity3 to keep hold of him @entity31 is finally getting the best out of @entity2			1
in his last five games , the @entity33 has performed better than he ever has in the @entity35 : @entity2 is performing at the peak of his powers he is not surprised by the turnaround in his own , and the team 's , fortunes — he began the season believing @entity17 could win the league this year with no @entity44 commitments			1
he told @entity45 last may : ' if we take @entity48 as the example there you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish without the @entity55			0
' he was mocked for the optimism but if @entity17 beat @entity4 at @entity28 they will be only five points behind the leaders			1
when @entity60 was manager , he and assistant @entity59 had scouted @entity61 for the ' @entity62 ' they believed the team needed before it became clear @entity17 could get the real thing			1
when @entity31 arrived , @entity2 took one step forward and two back			1
the early tinkering often meant he played in his favoured position behind the front two , but the three - man defence experiment undermined everything else the team did and results were poor			0
he ended up back where he had been at @entity4 under @entity3 — on the bench			1
@entity2 missed the football he had played earlier in his career at @entity77 and under @entity78 at @entity4			1
the free spirit was being shackled and the only consolation was that others felt the same , none more so than @entity83 , the player he is closest to at the club			0
the two had won an under 21 @entity86 together with @entity87 where they had enjoyed a freedom of expression now denied them			0
@entity83 , like @entity2 , was out of the side			2
when i interviewed him in 2012 before the @entity55 final he insisted on meeting in a @entity96 cafe because it was where he felt most at home			0
now he was in a mansion in @entity99 , south @entity100			0
as @entity17 's fortunes changed on the pitch , however , so @entity2 's season has been saved			1
with @entity105 now planted in front of a back four , the side has the balance to allow its creative players to thrive			0
@entity2 is not in his favoured no 10 position but he is also comfortable on the right			2
' i can come inside on my left foot and see the whole of the pitch in front of me , ' he says			0
@entity2 enjoys a close friendship with fellow @entity119 midfielder and @entity87 international @entity83 ( right ) @entity2 scores the second of his two goals against @entity48 at @entity122 this season , a stunning overhead kick it is the same left foot @entity22 joked about with him when he joined , saying he was glad to see him arrive but unhappy that he no longer possessed the best left peg at @entity27			1
the relationship with @entity22 is healthy , as is the one struck up with @entity129			0
both were players @entity2 admired before moving to @entity131			2
as well as the bond with @entity83 he is close to @entity133 — all three of them live on the same street			0
@entity136 is another with whom @entity2 played in that under 21 @entity86 success in @entity139 in 2011			2
having been part of the 2010 @entity144 - winning squad , @entity2 's willingness to step back down to the @entity141 says a lot about his character			1
the open letter he wrote to @entity4 fans when he left the club — against advice that it was not the best way to ingratiate himself with his new supporters — also spoke volumes			2
a @entity4 fan holds a sign to pay tribute to @entity2 , who earned himself a hero 's reputation in west @entity92 @entity2 never wanted to leave @entity92 but now he loves the countryside surrounding @entity100			1
it reminds him of his home in @entity163 , and that more than makes up for not being in the capital			0
life there was good under @entity78			0
' he trusted me to play and he wants to play attractive , fun and winning football , ' he said , revealing a fondness for someone whom @entity3 held in far lower esteem			2
@entity2 never banged on the manager 's door when he fell out of favour at @entity4			1
@entity3 never struck him as a man whose mind could be changed			2
he has always preferred to do his talking on the pitch			0
it has not always been easy but he is back at @entity4 on saturday and there has never been a better time to make a lasting statement			1
@entity2 gets ready to play a pass during a club training session at the @entity185 on friday			0

despite his status as a firm fan - favourite during his first two seasons at @entity4 , @entity2 could not do enough to *impress* @entity3
@entity2 was sold to @entity17 in *january* 2014 for a *£* *37m* *fee*
it took some time for the midfielder to *settle* at @entity27 but now he has
@entity17 travel away to @entity4 in the @entity35 on saturday
