the parents of the model shot dead by @entity2 say they do ' not feel that justice has been done ' but insisted they ' have to accept ' the sentence imposed by the judge			1
@entity2 , 27 , known as the @entity2 , was yesterday jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend @entity6 , 29 , but could be out of prison in just 10 months			1
the sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased			1
but they said their daughter 's death in the early hours of @entity28 last year remained shrouded in mystery , adding that ' only @entity2 knows ' the truth			1
miss @entity6 's mother june told the programme : ' i think the law must take its course , we have to accept what has happened			1
' if there is an appeal , well , there is an appeal			0
there is nothing we can change about that			0
but it will be difficult to go on even further , again			0
' we may not feel that justice has been done , but we have just got to accept what the judge decided			1
killer : @entity2 , 27 , known as the @entity2 , sits in the dock after he handed a five - year prison term at @entity52 for shooting @entity53 dead on @entity28 last year disgraced : the paralympian is led down to the cells before being driven off to prison			1
the sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased ' that 's the law , although it could have been completely different if her decision was different			1
' not everyone is entirely happy			0
but ... the facts that she had before her maybe were n't enough			2
but we have to live			0
' mrs @entity6 said the family had been ' disappointed in her ( the judge 's ) judgment ' , but felt the judge was left with few options because ' she only had certain facts before her '			1
mrs @entity6 said the family are ' very settled with the sentence '			2
she added : ' he has got to pay for what he has done and it is not that we want vengeance or anything , or for him to suffer with his disabilities			2
life cut short : @entity6 in her university days ( left ) and posing on set during the shooting of the reality show @entity87 which premiered on state television two days after her death ( right ) ' but at the same time , we feel satisfied that he will realise that you ca n't go around doing things like that			0
' we do n't want revenge , we want a fair punishment under the circumstances of his disability			2
' we would n't have wanted him to go to jail and be abused and i feel that it is fair			0
' he will realise that he ca n't go around doing that			0
he ca n't kill somebody like that			0
' her husband @entity13 said : ' we have gone along with the judge and her decision			1
' only @entity2 knows whether that sentence is acceptable to him			0
i 've got my feelings to the whole thing			0
' but we do accept what the judge handed down			2

@entity13 and @entity119 insist ' they have to accept ' five - year sentence
they do not want revenge - but say *athlete* ' has to pay for what he 's done '
@entity128 *branded* too lenient by some because he could be out in 10 months
believe judge had little option because ' she only had certain facts before her '
