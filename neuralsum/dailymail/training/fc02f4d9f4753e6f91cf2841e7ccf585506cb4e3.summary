declining heavy drinking will further undermine @entity57 ’s scheme to introduce minimum pricing on alcohol bought in supermarkets			0
the prime minister believes that blocking sales of cheap alcohol with minimum prices , possible 50 pence a unit , would tackle alcoholism , violence and anti-social behaviour , and save the @entity70 large sums			0
but the @entity24 findings back the majority of the @entity73 who have opposed the pricing plan on the grounds that it would punish lower income people who drink moderately			2
