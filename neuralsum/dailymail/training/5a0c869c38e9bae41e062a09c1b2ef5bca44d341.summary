medical advances mean it will soon be possible to bring the dead back to life , a doctor claims			1
modern techniques will enable a patient to be revived up to 24 hours after they stop breathing , dr @entity5 says			1
the @entity9 critical care physician , who trained in @entity10 , said : ‘ we may soon be rescuing people from death ’s clutches hours , or even longer , after they have actually died			2
’ claims : dr @entity5 says medical advances mean it could soon be possible to bring people back to life 24 hours after they stopped breathing			1
dr @entity5 also said he could have saved the life of actor @entity23 he claims the @entity9 actor @entity23 , star of @entity25 – who died aged 51 in @entity26 last month – might have survived if he had suffered his massive heart attack in @entity28			1
‘ i believe if he died here , he could still be alive			0
we ’d cool him down , pump oxygen to the tissues , which prevents them from dying , ’ dr @entity5 told @entity31 ’s @entity30 magazine			1
‘ clinically dead , he could then be cared for by the cardiologist			0
he would make an angiogram , find the clot , take it out , put in a stent and we would restart the heart			0
’ dr @entity5 , whose new book on resuscitation science is called @entity45 , said death should be reversible for many patients , providing they are in the right place getting the right treatment			1
‘ of course we ca n’t rescue everybody and many people with heart attacks have other major problems , ’ he said			2
‘ but if all the latest medical technologies and training had been implemented , which clearly has n’t been done , then in principle the only people who should die and stay dead are those that have an underlying condition that is untreatable			2
‘ a heart attack is treatable			0
a terminal cancer is n’t , neither are many infections with multiresistant pathogens			0
in these cases , even if we ’d restart the heart , it would stop again and again			0
‘ my basic message : the death we commonly perceive today in 2013 is a death that can be reversed			1
’ dr @entity5 , head of intensive care at the @entity73 in @entity28 , said resuscitation figures tell their own story			1
the average resuscitation rate for cardiac arrest patients is 18 per cent in @entity9 hospitals and 16 per cent in @entity79			1
but at his hospital it is 33 per cent – and the rate peaked at 38 per cent earlier this year			2
eternal life : critical care physician , dr @entity5 , said his ' revival research ' is on the cusp of major breakthroughs which will allow the dead to rise again after being dead for some time ‘ most , but not all of our patients , get discharged with no neurological damage whatsoever , ’ he said , adding that it is a ‘ widely held misconception ’ – even among doctors – that the brain begins to suffer massive damage from oxygen deprivation three to five minutes after the heart stops			1
‘ in the past decade we have seen tremendous progress			0
with today ’s medicine , we can bring people back to life up to one , maybe two hours , sometimes even longer , after their heart stopped beating and they have thus died by circulatory failure			1
‘ in the future , we will likely get better at reversing death			2
’ the techniques he advocates are not cryogenics – freezing the body immediately after death – but cooling it down to best preserve brain cells while keeping up the level of oxygen in the blood			0
this buys time to fix the underlying problem and restart the heart , he claims			0
he says that if someone collapses with a heart attack , call 999 then immediately place bags of frozen vegetables on them until the ambulance arrives , as it helps protect the brain			0
‘ it is possible that in 20 years , we may be able to restore people to life 12 hours or maybe even 24 hours after they have died			2
‘ you could call that resurrection , if you will			0
but i still call it resuscitation science			0

dr @entity5 said his research is on the cusp of major breakthroughs
at the moment medics can bring people back to life within two hours but he believes this *window* is about to be *significantly* widened
average resuscitation rate for cardiac arrest patients in @entity79 is 16 **%** but at dr @entity5 *'s* @entity146 it is 33 **%**
he added : ' my basic message : the death we commonly perceive today in 2013 is a death that can be reversed '
