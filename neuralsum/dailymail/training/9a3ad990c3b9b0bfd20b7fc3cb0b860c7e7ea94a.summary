it 'll look like a typical winter when bitterly cold temperatures invade parts of the @entity3 this week			1
the good news is that is wo n't be accompanied by precipitation that turned much of the southern states into a skating rink and it wo n't be cold enough to freeze your eyeballs or - maybe worse for parents - close schools			2
first , it will be cold			2
@entity14 will see the tail end of a storm that could leave up to as much as five inches of snow by early tuesday			1
after that , @entity19 temperatures like those seen in @entity21 and @entity22 on sunday will rush in — with highs in the single digits			2
@entity27 brewing : @entity14 is set to be hit by another round of snow early this week - above @entity30 of the @entity32 suburb cleans up his driveway slipping into the chill : @entity35 , above , cycles through the @entity37 cold , which is set to get even more intense it 'll be a similar story in @entity40 , where rain showers will give way to cold air			1
by thursday , ' @entity40 will be lucky if it hits 20 ' for a high and could see lows near 10 degrees , according to @entity46 with the @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity49 , @entity50			1
the chill will move south , too			0
@entity52 will see low temperatures down to about 15 degrees monday and tuesday — but there wo n't be any ice to accompany it			1
and in the @entity56 , a stream of @entity59 moisture will drop as much as six inches of rain in the @entity62 area — and could mean substantial snowfall in the @entity64			0
further south in @entity65 - a part of the country that desperately needs the rain - skies will be sunny			0
a dip in the jet stream means cold air from @entity72 and points north is plummeting into the eastern two - thirds of the @entity3			1
getting cold : @entity40 will be lucky to get any warmer than 20 degrees , forecasters said , while parts of @entity76 will hit 15 wrap up ! @entity77 is already braced for the chilly weather in @entity79 , @entity80 , where he spent sunday sledding but forecasters are shying away from calling it a ' polar vortex ' - the phrase which took on a life of its own last year , and was blamed for everything from ice storms to the inability of the @entity92 to score touchdowns			1
but the @entity48 is skittish about going anywhere near the words that start with p and end with @entity97 the forthcoming cold can be linked to the vortex , @entity46 pointed out , as the air is coming from near the north pole			2
but the low - pressure system itself is n't going to sink into the @entity3 this year , just the temperatures that precede it			1
meteorologists have a technical term for what the country is now experiencing : @entity110			0
what should people do to prepare for the temperatures ? bundle up			0
for much of the country , this is the first true taste of winter , so there 's a chance people are n't prepared			0
dress properly and remember that below - freezing temperatures can cause hypothermia , @entity46 said			0
a bright spot : there does n't seem to be any huge winter storms poised to strike , meaning travel wo n't be more difficult than it usually is this time of year			0
temperatures are expected to be lower than normal for a good chunk of the week , @entity46 said , but they could rise a bit by the end of the week			2
but then again , it 's only january .			0

@entity40 will be ' lucky ' to see temperatures above 20 degrees
five inches of snow could hit @entity14 by tuesday *morning*
even @entity52 , @entity76 , will be as cold as 15 degrees next week
system is related to polar vortex , which is forcing cold winds into @entity3
