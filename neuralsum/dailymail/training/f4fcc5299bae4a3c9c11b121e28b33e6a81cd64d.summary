incredibly , he was out of hospital within six days of the fork being removed			1
mr @entity10 , who runs the 160 acre farm with his mum @entity43 , 78 , said he knew he was in trouble when he felt a ' sharp twinge ' in his backside			1
he went on : ' i had picked up some up some hay and had placed it on the floor to cut the wrap and i do n’t think i applied the hand - brake properly on the tractor because i felt this fork going into me			1
' as i was bending over i felt this sharp twinge and i knew that ’s when i was in trouble			0
' i turned to work out what was happening i saw it was rolling towards me and the tine went into my right buttock			0
' it ended up going through and poked out of my abdomen on the left			0

all i was thinking about was how i was going get free			0
' all i could do was shout for help so i was shouting as loud as i could but i knew no one was at home at the farm			0
' luckily some neighbours heard me and they drove down the lane to find out what was going on			0
' as they saw me they got out and ran towards me			0
' they then called 999 and everyone came along , the ambulance , police , fire engine , and air ambulance			2
' to get me free they had to unbolt the tine ( prong ) from the tractor and they then got me on a stretcher and put me in the air ambulance with it still in me			2
' they then flew me hospital which only took 12 minutes			2
at first they struggled to close the helicopter ’s door with the tine sticking out			0
i was awake the whole time			0
' i was taken to @entity105 and transferred to theatre and at that point i do n’t really remember much more			0
' because [ the spike ] hit my key fob it stopped going through my body any further and the surgeon said they just had to pull it out a bit at a time			1

they probably saved my life			0
' surgeon @entity133 , who performed the four - hour operation , said it was one of the most unusual injuries he has ever had to deal with			1
he said : ' we put him through the scanner to see what exactly we were dealing with			0
' we then had to put him on the operating table in the theatre at 45 degrees because of how the spike was sticking through him			2
' to keep him at that angle we had to use sandbags to prop him up and support him , which is highly unusual			0
' we then had to ease his clothes off around the spike as he was fully clothed			2
' i then had to operate on him on his side , which can be quite difficult when you are not used to doing it			0
' in total three of us were doing the surgery and we just had to pull the spike in a controlled direction			2
' the spike had entered the pelvis and was only 1.5cm from his urethra and it was only an inch from the vessel in front of the rectum and behind the bladder			1
so it missed the rectal tube			0
' if the spike had n’t missed any of those then it would have been life threatening and he could have been left having to use a colostomy bag			2
' mr @entity10 was extremely lucky and he has recovered amazingly well			2
