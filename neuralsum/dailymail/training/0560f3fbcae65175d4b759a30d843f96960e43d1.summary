@entity2 prices hit a new record high this month after jumping 11 per cent over the past year , the @entity0 said this morning			1
the average house price across the @entity5 is now £ 189,306 – up £ 357 , or 0.8 per cent , in just a month			1
this is up from the 0.2 per cent rise in july , and marks the sixteenth monthly increase in a row			0
@entity2 price growth is still below the one per cent month - on - month increase recorded in june , but ‘ continues to outpace earnings by a wide margin ’ , said @entity0 chief economist @entity14			1
house prices in @entity5 have soared over the past two decades , according to figures released by @entity0 this morning @entity2 prices in @entity20 soared by just under 20 per cent in the past 12 months – the fastest growth in more than a decade , @entity18 figures show			1
at £ 457,072 , the average house price in @entity20 is more than two - and - a - half times the typical property across @entity25 and @entity26			2
the last time that prices in @entity20 saw such a large increase was in march 2003			2
a total of 1,032 properties were sold in @entity25 and @entity26 for more than £ 1 million in may , which is a third higher than in may 2013			0
around seven in 10 of these sales took place in @entity20			0
wages have been inching up by less than one per cent a year on average , mr @entity14 said			0
but because of historically low interest rates houses are still affordable			0
he said : ‘ at a national level , housing affordability does not appear stretched by historic standards , in part due to the low level of mortgage rates			0
’ mr @entity14 added : ‘ the cost of servicing a typical mortgage remains close to the long run average as a share of take home pay			0
’ typical @entity5 house prices first surpassed their 2007 peak in cash terms in may this year and they have been hitting new records every month since			1
year - on - year house price growth has been in double digits since april , according to the building society 's study			2
despite property values reaching record highs over the summer , there have also been signs of a cool down in the market in recent months			0
mortgage approvals generally dipped after stricter lending rules , which force lenders to ask for more detail about a mortgage applicant 's spending habits , came into force at the end of april but approvals have since rebounded slightly			0
@entity0 said it is still unclear how much of the cooling in activity was due to the introduction of the new ‘ @entity77 ’ rules as opposed to an underlying loss of momentum in the market			0
@entity14 , @entity0 's chief economist , said : ‘ the outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain			0
‘ the number of mortgage approvals fell by almost 20 per cent between january and may , suggesting that activity was cooling			0
’ @entity2 prices were rising at more than 25 per cent a year under @entity85 , before crashing by more than 15 per cent after the 2007 crash once inflation is taken into account the ' real ' cost of houses in @entity5 has remained relatively stable over the last decade house prices increased in @entity20 by 3.3 per cent in july , but fell by 0.6 per cent in @entity92 and @entity93 he said the prospect of an increase in interest rates and the squeeze on wages was beginning to hold back soaring house prices			1
@entity0 ’s report this morning also revealed the ‘ train station premium ’ in @entity5 ’s biggest cities			1
it found that being close to an underground or train station in @entity20 added £ 40,000 to a property ’s value			1
in @entity109 and @entity110 people are willing to pay around £ 10,000 extra to be near good transport links			1
mr @entity14 said : ‘ we recently examined how the proximity to a tube or railway station impacted property prices in three major cities ( @entity20 , @entity110 and @entity109 ) after taking account of other property characteristics , such as property type , size and local neighbourhood type			1
‘ our research suggests that people are willing to pay a significant premium to be close to a station			2
‘ the impact is most marked in @entity20 , where being located 500m from a station attracts a 10.5 per cent price premium over an otherwise identical property 1,500m from a station			2
‘ this is equivalent to approximately £ 42,000 based on the value of the typical @entity20 home			0
in @entity110 , the premium on a typical property for being 500m from station is 4.6 per cent ( £ 12,000 ) , while in @entity109 the premium is 6 per cent ( £ 9,400 )			1
‘ @entity20 homebuyers ’ willingness to pay a greater premium for being close to a station compared with those in @entity110 and @entity109 probably reflects the greater reliance on public transport in the capital , with residents less likely to drive			1
‘ @entity20 also has the densest network of stations and services , with 94 per cent of properties within 1.5km of a station , compared with 72 per cent in @entity109 and 69 per cent in @entity110			2

house prices rose £ 357 , or 0.8 **%** , in *august* according to a @entity0 report
prices have been rising for 16 months , surpassing the 2007 peak in may

in @entity109 and @entity110 people are willing to pay £ 10,000 extra
@entity2 price boom driven by 20 **%** price rises in @entity20 , say @entity18
