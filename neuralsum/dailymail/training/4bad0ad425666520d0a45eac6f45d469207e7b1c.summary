prince @entity0 , who is said to be ready to take over the management of the @entity4 's @entity3 estate in @entity5 he is already taking part in a ‘ gentle succession ’ from his mother , representing the @entity4 on a growing number of state occasions			1
now prince @entity0 is stepping into his father ’s shoes , too			1
the @entity13 has learned that the @entity14 is privately handing management of @entity3 to his eldest son			1
the job includes overseeing arable , livestock and fruit farms , property and a 240 - acre country park			0
the 93 - year - old @entity14 is responsible for several estates , including @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity3 in @entity5 , where the @entity26 has just enjoyed @entity27			1
but local sources say prince @entity29 started to pass control of @entity3 ’s 20,000 acres to @entity0 this year			1
the @entity14 will continue to be consulted over changes , but @entity0 will have a more hands - on role			2

‘ @entity0 is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running			2

‘ he ’ll do things like introduce rewards for environmentally friendly farming			0
@entity29 ’s a passionate conservationist but has very set ways on how the estate should be run			1
he does n’t like outsiders interfering			0
