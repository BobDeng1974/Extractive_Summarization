by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 17 may 2012 more than 900 million people worldwide check their @entity2 accounts at least once a month , but millions more are @entity2 holdouts			1
they say they do n't want @entity2			1
they insist they do n't need @entity2			1
they say they 're living life just fine without the long - forgotten acquaintances that the world 's largest social network sometimes resurrects			2
no thanks : @entity14 , 77 , arguably the world 's first internet user , says @entity2 is fine for his grandchildren , but it 's not for him ; he is pictured in 2009 do n't try to friend @entity18 on @entity2			1
you wo n't find her there			0
you wo n't find @entity23 , either			0
' i 'm absolutely in touch with everyone in my life that i want to be in touch with , ' ms @entity26 says			0
' i do n't need to share triviality with someone that i might have known for six months 12 years ago			0
' even without people like ms @entity26 , @entity2 is one of the biggest business success stories in history			1
the site had one million users by the end of 2004 , the year @entity38 started it in his @entity43 dorm room			2
two years later , it had 12 million			0
@entity2 had 500 million by summer 2010 and 901 million as of march 31 , according to the company			1
that staggering rise in popularity is one reason why @entity2 's initial public offering is one of the most hotly anticipated in years			1
the company 's shares are expected to begin trading on the @entity53 on friday under the ticker symbol ' fb '			0
@entity2 is likely to have an estimated market valuation of some $ 100 billion , making it worth more than @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60			1
well - served : this is the @entity2 server room at the company 's data centre in @entity64 , @entity65 ; the social network estimates @entity2 has 901million users worldwide @entity2 still has plenty of room to grow , particularly in developing countries where people are only starting to get internet access			1
as it is , about 80 per cent of its users are outside @entity74 and @entity75			1
but if @entity2 is to live up to its pre-ipo hype and reward the investors who are clamouring for its stock this week , it needs to convince some of the resisters to join			1
two out of every five @entity74 adults have not joined @entity2 , according to a recent @entity0 - @entity82 poll			1
among those who are not on @entity2 , a third cited a lack of interest or need			1
if all those people continue to shun @entity2 , the social network could become akin to a postal system that only delivers mail to houses on one side of the street			1
the system is n't as useful , and people are n't apt to spend as much time with it			2
that means fewer opportunities for @entity2 to sell ads. some people do n't join the social network because they do n't have a computer or internet access , are concerned about privacy , or generally dislike @entity2			1
those without a college education are less likely to be on @entity2 , as are those with lower incomes			1
women who choose to skip @entity2 are more likely than men to cite privacy issues , while seniors are more likely than those 50 - 64 years old to cite computer issues , according the @entity0 - @entity82 poll			1
about three - quarters of seniors are not on @entity2			1
by contrast , more than half of those under 35 use it every day			0
the poll of 1,004 adults nationwide was conducted by @entity120 and corporate communications may 3 - 7 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 per centage points			1
@entity126 , director of the @entity127 , says that new communications channels - from the telephone to radio , tv and personal computers - often breed a cadre of holdouts in their early days			2
' it 's disorienting because people have different relationships with others depending on the media they use , ' @entity135 says			2
' but we 've been through this before			0
as each new communications media comes to prominence , there is a period of adoption			0
' @entity14 , 77 , says @entity2 is fine for his grandchildren , but it 's not for him			1
' i do not want more distractions , ' he says			0
' as it is , i am deluged with email			0
my friends and colleagues have ready access to me and i do n't really want another service that i would feel obliged to check into on a frequent basis			0
' @entity14 says his resistance is generational , but discomfort with technology is n't a factor			0
after all , @entity14 is arguably the world 's first internet user			0
the @entity165 , @entity164 professor was part of the team that invented the @entity168			0
his lab was where researchers gathered in 1969 to send test data between two bulky computers - the beginnings of the @entity176 network , which morphed into the internet we know today			2
' i 'm having a ` been - there , done - that ' feeling , ' mr @entity14 says			0
' there 's not a need on my part for reaching out and finding new social groups to interact with			0
i have trouble keeping up with those i 'm involved with now			0
' @entity23 , 35 , who works at an advertising and media planning company in @entity189 , says he may be missing out on what friends - of - friends - of - friends are doing , but he does n't need @entity2 to connect with family and closer acquaintances			1
connected : @entity2 ceo @entity38 created the social network from his dorm room at @entity43 eight years ago anticipation : tomorrow , @entity53 will offer @entity2 stocks at an estimated $ 36 a share , and is one of the most hotly anticipated ipos in years ' if we 're going to go out to do stuff , we organize it ( outside ) of @entity2 , ' he says			1
@entity204 , a professor who studies online culture and communications at the @entity207 , says many resisters consider @entity2 to be too much of a chore			1
who gets rich from @entity2 â€™s expected ipo ? assuming a mid-point price of $ 36 , following are details on the amount the selling stockholders will make : ' we 've added social networking to our lives			1
we have n't added any hours to our days , ' mr @entity204 says			0
' the decision to be online on @entity2 is simultaneously a decision not to be doing something else			2
' mr @entity204 says many people on @entity2 try to overcome that by multitasking , but they end up splitting their attention and engaging with others online only superficially			1
@entity26 , 47 , a restaurant manager in @entity225 , says she was surprised when colleagues on an @entity228 - teaching program in rural @entity229 in 2010 opted to spend their breaks checking @entity2			1
' i spent my time on break trying to learn more about the @entity229 culture , really taking advantage of it , ' she says			0
' i went on walks with some of the students and asked them questions			0
' @entity24 , 32 , a music professor at @entity238 in @entity239 , @entity240 , was on @entity2 not long after its founding in 2004 , but she quit in 2010			2
in part , it was because of growing concerns about her privacy and @entity2 's ongoing encouragement of people to share more about themselves with the company , with marketers and with the world			1
she says she 's been much more productive since leaving			0
' i was a typical user , on it once or twice a day , ' she says			0
' after a certain point , i sort of resented how it felt like an obligation rather than fun			0
' besides @entity2 resisters and quitters , there are those who take a break			2
in some cases , people quit temporarily as they apply for new jobs , so that potential employers wo n't stumble on photos of their wild nights out drinking			0
although @entity2 does n't make it easy to find , it offers options for both deleting and suspending accounts			2
@entity24 says it takes effort to stay in touch with friends and relatives without @entity2			2
for instance , she has to make mental notes of when her friends are expecting babies , knowing that they have become so used to @entity2 ' that they do n't engage with us anymore			2
' ' i 'm like , ` hmmm , when is nine months ? ' i have to remember to contact them since they wo n't remember to tell me when the baby 's born			0
' @entity282 , 54 , a government lawyer in @entity283 , says that when his nephew 's son was born , pictures went up on @entity2 almost immediately			2
as a @entity2 holdout , he had to wait for someone to email photos			2
after years of resisting , @entity282 plans to join next month , mostly because he does n't want to lose touch with younger relatives who choose @entity2 as their primary means of communication			1
but for every @entity282 , there is an @entity25 , who has no desire for @entity2 and prefers email and postcards			2
' i prefer to keep my communications personal and targeted , ' says @entity25 , 41 , a pharmaceutical consultant in @entity189			0
' you 're getting a message that 's written for you			0
' clearly someone took the time to sit down to do it			0

two out of every five @entity74 adults have not joined @entity2 , according to recent poll
but as of march 31 , @entity2 has 901million users worldwide
about three quarters of elderly people are not on @entity2
younger *non-users* - especially women - cite privacy concerns
