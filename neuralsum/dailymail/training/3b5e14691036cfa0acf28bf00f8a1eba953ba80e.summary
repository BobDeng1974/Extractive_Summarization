@entity0 is just the man to evaluate the hype around @entity2 and the comparisons being made with @entity4 , as the long span of his career meant he played with both centres			1
after @entity10 ’s man of the moment touched down twice at @entity12 on saturday , following a try - scoring contribution to the victory in @entity15 , the ‘ new @entity4 ’ tag was being applied with more conviction than ever			1
@entity0 , the national team ’s attacking skills coach , worked with @entity2 during his transition from playing to coaching at @entity20 , so he has been aware of his potential for several years			1
@entity2 scored two tries for @entity10 against @entity23 and has earned comparisons with @entity4 @entity0 ( left ) played with @entity4 and now works with @entity2 due to his @entity10 coaching role @entity4 ( left ) charges through @entity28 's defence to score a try for @entity10 at @entity12 asked about the comparisons with his former @entity32 and @entity10 accomplice , @entity0 said : ‘ i made them four years ago but he ’s a different player			1
@entity34 was more of a swerving outside centre , when there ’s a big hole in the 13 channel			2
‘ there are n’t many holes any more , so @entity2 ’s footwork and his ability to slip out of tackles , like you saw ( on saturday ) and last week , is phenomenal			1
that ’s the x factor you need to win games			1
you know you need the x factor like that to be able to break defences down			2
‘ but @entity34 got 70 - odd caps so we ’ll see how many @entity2 gets			1
he ’s got a lot more tries to get , to be fair to @entity4			1
but three from eight caps is not bad			2
it ’s brilliant to see , it ’s refreshing			2
’ there were many satisfying aspects of @entity10 ’s six - try demolition of @entity23 which maintained the fine start to their @entity61 crusade and a few glaring problems to address			1
but as the capacity crowd dispersed there was no doubt about the primary subject for excited discussion			2
@entity2 is creating a buzz			1
he has been the form centre in the country this season and now his stellar form has transferred seamlessly to the test arena			2
his tries on saturday came after he had been shunted out to the wing as part of a reshuffle caused by the early loss of @entity79			2
the 23 - year - old ’s first try , from turnover ball near halfway , featured a glorious side - step and a turbo - charged burst clear of the covering defenders			1
his second strike was expertly crafted by @entity88 ’s delayed pass to send him hurtling through a gap			0
@entity2 ( lower ) crossed the line twice for @entity10 against @entity23 and has three tries in eight appearances @entity93 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity95 ( left ) in @entity10 's @entity61 victory against @entity23 @entity10 attacking skills coach @entity0 ( left ) was a @entity98 winner in the 2003 tournament in @entity100 @entity0 is delighted to see confirmation of the promise he saw years ago as @entity2 shows there is a place in the modern international game for subtle attacking qualities amid the thunder of heavy cavalry			1
‘ everybody thinks international rugby is all about size but players who play against @entity2 do n’t want to defend him because he ’s lethal , ’ he said			1
‘ he ’s a hard man to stop			0
‘ he ’s very hard to break down if you get the ball to him early , and that ’s where @entity88 ( @entity116 ) has been phenomenal			0
@entity88 gives him early ball and then he ’s able to see what ’s in front of him			0
he just plants guys down and gets round them			0
he ’s never tackled behind the gain line			2
he always makes an extra two or three metres and that ’s crucial when it comes to attack , especially in the 13 channel			0
’ @entity2 ’s exploits from the flank against @entity23 will give the @entity10 coaches cause to consider him as a wing option if they ever have their full midfield contingent fit			1
but he is making a powerful case for a long run in his preferred position at outside centre			0
the no 13 shirt was seemingly only made to measure for @entity136 but the @entity137 wrecking ball faces a battle to regain his place when he returns from injury			0
‘ going into a @entity98 you ’ve got to have four centres , ’ said @entity0 , a member of the victorious 2003 @entity10 team			1
‘ having guys like @entity136 who can break down a defence in a different way to how @entity2 does is what you want			1
you ’ve got a good balance there — and competition			0
‘ for @entity136 to get his place back you ’re going to have to see some fireworks			0
let ’s see how it carries on going			0
it ’s just great to have a consistency again between a centre partnership			0
we ’ll see how they develop			0
i ’m sure they will			0
’ @entity0 said there will have to be ' fireworks ' from @entity136 ( centre ) to regain his place in the @entity10 side @entity0 also praised the impressive performances of @entity88 in @entity10 's @entity61 campaign so far @entity10 coach @entity169 will want to see his side combat the sluggish start made against @entity23 @entity10 were far too strong for @entity23 but @entity173 ’s tempered reaction to the victory told its own tale of shortcomings which must be addressed			1
a repeat of saturday ’s sluggish start will be far harder to recover from against @entity28 in @entity179 in 13 days ’ time when the championship ’s two unbeaten teams collide			0
of the six @entity185 tries , the first by @entity183 owed much to a generous interpretation of the footage by the @entity188			0
@entity2 ’s finishes were sublime , while @entity190 was alert enough to pounce with a quick tap penalty from close range when the visitors ’ defence had switched off			1
the other scorers were the recalled @entity196 and @entity197 , which went some way to justifying their return to the test fold			0
captain @entity202 had a titanic influence as usual — topping the tackle charts as always with 18 , while his @entity206 skipper @entity205 built on his superb autumn campaign with another imposing display			0
in the second row , @entity209 again belied his inexperience with a forceful contribution and no 8 @entity183 ran amok as the game wore on			0
@entity10 captain @entity202 ( right ) made the most tackles in the game with @entity23 and had a huge influence @entity196 ( right ) scored a try against @entity23 to help justify his return to the @entity10 test fold @entity221 ( second left ) created @entity196 's try but also squandered a three - on - one overlap in the first half but @entity169 was rightly concerned by a dip in defensive intensity which allowed the @entity227 to score three tries			1
in attacking terms , @entity221 created @entity196 ’s try but lacked composure when he squandered a three - on - one overlap just before half - time			2
such fundamental lapses are not critical in a one - sided encounter but they could be fatal in a @entity98 knock - out match			2
still , clear room for improvement from a winning position is probably the management ’s ultimate scenario at this juncture .			0

@entity2 crossed the line twice in @entity10 's *47* - 17 win over @entity23
his @entity61 performances have drawn comparisons to @entity4
but @entity10 coach @entity0 believes @entity2 possesses different skills
