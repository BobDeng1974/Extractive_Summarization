by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 12:45 est , 9 may 2012 @entity2 's new president @entity1 has made a thinly - veiled attack on @entity4 by claiming @entity5 treats @entity6 ' like a self - service restaurant '			1
the new @entity9 president - elect made his aggressive position towards the @entity11 clear while outlining plans for his first meeting with prime minister @entity4			1
asked by the news website @entity15 how he planned to deal with mr @entity4 , given the fact that the @entity18 leader had snubbed him during a visit to @entity21 earlier this year , mr @entity1 also said he would meet him ' quickly '			1
outspoken : @entity2 president @entity1 arrives at his campaign headquarters in @entity24 today but mr @entity1 , who openly describes himself as an ' enemy of finance ' , said he would make his antipathy towards the @entity21 clear			1
mr @entity1 fired a broadside at the coalition government by criticising @entity5 's supposed ' obsession ' with protecting the @entity21 from @entity32 - inspired legislation			2
mr @entity1 said : ' let us recognise that the @entity11 have been particularly timid about the question of financial regulation and only concerned by the interests of the @entity21 , hence their reticence on the establishment of a financial transactions tax and @entity6 fiscal harmonisation			0
' and to that is added a relative indifference to the fate of the @entity44 , because @entity5 is protected against speculation since its central bank can intervene directly to finance its debt			0
difference of opinion : mr @entity1 said he only plans to meet @entity4 ' quickly ' ' @entity6 is not a cash till and less still a self - service restaurant			1
' as mr @entity4 warned that the single currency is in ' extreme trouble ' @entity1 suggested that @entity5 is ' indifferent to the fate of the euro area ' and ' attentive only to the interests of the @entity21 '			2
this is despite the fact that billions of pounds of @entity11 taxpayers ' money is already being used to prop up the euro			0
mr @entity1 , who is against austerity measures designed to save the euro , went on to threaten the @entity11 with new @entity6 - wide taxes to neuter the @entity21			0
he signalled his support for an @entity66 - wide transaction tax on financial deals and a fresh push for tax harmonisation - both of which are fiercely opposed by the @entity11 government			0
the euro fell to a three - and - a - half year low following mr @entity1 's victory , which was accompanied by political and economic turmoil in @entity76			0
mr @entity1 will be officially sworn in as @entity2 president on may 15 , replacing conservative @entity78			1
the following day , mr @entity1 is due to travel to @entity79 to meet @entity80 in a bid to convince her to ditch her austerity programme for @entity6 and sign up to a growth pact			2
the @entity85 chancellor has already written to mr @entity1 telling him that the eurozone was looking to the two leaders to take the ' necessary decisions ' to resolve the debt crisis			0
' like a self - service restaurant ' : mr @entity1 said @entity6 was not a cash till ( file photo ) @entity2 's outgoing president @entity78 , right , shakes hands with president - elect @entity1 , left , before a ceremony marking the 67th anniversary of the @entity97 victory over @entity79 in @entity98 ' it is up to us to take the necessary decisions for the @entity66 and the eurozone , to prepare our societies for the future and protect and advance prosperity in a sustainable way , ' ms @entity80 wrote in a letter congratulating him on his poll victory			1
