this year , the typical employee will fail to use a little over three days of holiday ( 3.34 days ) , as opposed to an average of 1.55 wasted days in previous years			1
and a third of respondents are blaming the busy nature of their jobs , claiming they simply can not take any more time off work			2
a new study found that 18 - 24 year old brits were least likely to use up all of their annual holiday days meanwhile , one in six ( 16 per cent ) workers are so worried about losing their jobs they fear being away from the office on annual leave			1

travelling for @entity32 ? not likely ! 36 % of survey takers will not claim their days by the end of 2014 but being stuck in the office will cause 1 in 3 to become angry - yet , admittedly , helps to further their career yet the poll of 2,000 workers found those most likely to not use all of their annual leave were those aged 18 to 24 years old			1
indeed , a third of younger staff are worried about keeping their job - making them the most concerned group when it comes to job security			0
being stuck in the office may also cause one in three to become angry , yet the same number are pleased they put in the hard graft as it helps further their career			0

' it 's good to take a break every now and then , and especially as the year draws in a last minute day off might come as a welcome treat			0
' if you take your leftover holiday you can use the time to visit friends , family or have a long weekend away			0
