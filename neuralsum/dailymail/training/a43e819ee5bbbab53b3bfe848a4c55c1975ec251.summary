the levels of @entity2 sea - ice last week hit an all - time high – confounding climate change computer models which say it should be in decline			1
@entity7 ’s @entity6 , which is funded by @entity8 , revealed that ice around the southern continent covers about 16million sq km , more than 2.1 million more than is usual for the time of year			1
it is by far the highest level since satellite observations on which the figures depend began in 1979.in statistical terms , the extent of the ice cover is hugely significant			2
the @entity2 surge is so big that overall , although @entity35 ice has decreased , the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long - term average			1
in its authoritative @entity39 released last year , the @entity38 @entity37 admitted that the computer models on which scientists base their projections say @entity2 ice should be in decline , not increasing			1
the report said : ‘ there is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the observed increase in @entity2 sea ice extent since 1979 , due to … incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change			1
’ an adult chinstrap penguin jumps out of the sea at @entity56 , @entity2 a @entity58 seal on an iceberg in @entity60 , @entity2			1
crabeater seals are the most common large mammal on the planet after humans , with an estimated population of 15 million some scientists have suggested the @entity2 ice increase may itself be caused by global warming			1
but professor @entity69 , head of climate science at the @entity71 in @entity72 , said the arguments were not convincing			0
she added : ‘ we do not have a quantitative , predictive understanding of the rise in @entity2 sea ice extent			1
’ she said it was becoming increasingly apparent that long - term cycles in ocean temperatures were responsible for a significant proportion of the ice decline in the @entity35 – a process that may be starting to reverse			1
prof @entity69 also revealed that because of the ‘ pause ’ , in which world average temperatures have not risen for more than 16 years , the @entity35 ice decline has been ‘ touted ’ by many as the most important evidence for continued global warming			1
but in her view , climate scientists have to consider evidence from both @entity94			0
she added : ‘ convincing arguments regarding the causes of sea - ice variations require understanding and ability to model both the @entity35 and @entity2			1
’ the @entity20 separating the @entity21 from the @entity22 off @entity23 for years , computer simulations have predicted that sea ice should be disappearing from the @entity94			1
now , with the news that @entity2 sea - ice levels have hit new highs , comes yet another mishap to tarnish the credibility of climate science			1
climatologists base their doom - laden predictions of the @entity111 ’s climate on computer simulations			2
but these have long been the subject of ridicule because of their stunning failure to predict the pause in warming – nearly 18 years long on some measures – since the turn of the last century			0
it ’s the same with sea ice			2
we hear a great deal about the decline in @entity35 sea ice , in line with or even ahead of predictions			1
but why are environmentalists and scientists so much less keen to discuss the long - term increase in the southern hemisphere ? in fact , across the globe , there are about one million square kilometres more sea ice than 35 years ago , which is when satellite measurements began			2
it ’s fair to say that this has been something of an embarrassment for climate modellers			0
but it does n’t stop there			0
in recent days a new scandal over the integrity of temperature data has emerged , this time in @entity7 , where it has been revealed as much as 40 per cent of temperature data there are not real thermometer readings			2
many temperature stations have closed , but rather than stop recording data from these posts , the authorities have taken the remarkable step of ‘ estimating ’ temperatures based on the records of surrounding stations			0
so vast swathes of the data are actually from ‘ zombie ’ stations that have long since disappeared			0
this is bad enough , but it has also been discovered that the @entity7 ’s @entity164 is using estimates even when perfectly good raw data is available to it – and that it has adjusted historical records			0
why should it do this ? many have noted that the effect of all these changes is to produce a warmer present and a colder past , with the net result being the impression of much faster warming			0
they draw their conclusions accordingly			0
naturally , if the @entity7 temperature records are indeed found to have been manipulated , this is unlikely to greatly affect our overall picture of rising temperatures at the end of the last century and a standstill thereafter			0
the @entity7 is , after all , only a small proportion of the globe			0
similarly , climatologists ’ difficulties with the sea ice may be of little scientific significance in the greater scheme of things			2
we have only a few decades of data , and in climate terms this is probably too short to demonstrate that either the @entity2 increase or the @entity35 decrease is anything other than natural variability			2
but the relentless focus by activist scientists on the @entity35 decline does suggest a political imperative rather than a scientific one – and when put together with the story of the @entity7 temperature records , it ’s hard to avoid the impression that what the public is being told is less than the unvarnished truth			0
as their credulity is stretched more and more , the public will – quite rightly – treat demands for action with increasing caution … @entity217			0

ice is covering 16m sq km , more than 2.1m *unusual* for time of year
@entity38 computer models say @entity2 ice should be in decline , not increasing
