an angry motorcyclist has been caught on camera in @entity5 suffering a humiliating fall after trying to kick a moving car			1
in what appears to be a bizarre road rage incident , the biker is seen from a trailing car zooming up behind his target on a road in @entity14 before getting alongside and giving it a kick with his left leg			1
@entity29 uploaded the video to @entity31 saying : ' in @entity14 , the car accidentally drifted a little to the right lane			1
' the biker started cursing heavily , making a huge fuss on traffic			2
not being enough , he stopped the bike and i knew it was coming			0
' so i started recording			0
after that , the car stopped by a police car nearby			2
the rest i do nâ€™t know			0
' the man on the motorcycle was not seriously injured			2
but straight after he loses balance and veers off to the right and into the outside lane ouch : the motorcyclist tumbles over as his bike goes flying in @entity14 , @entity5 embarassing : the biker , looking like he is in pain , pulls up the left leg of his trousers			1
he was not seriously hurt in the incident			0
