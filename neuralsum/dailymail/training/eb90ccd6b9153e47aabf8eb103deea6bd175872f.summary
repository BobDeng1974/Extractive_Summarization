by @entity0 there has long been a theory that smoking more potent cannabis is actually healthier than puffing on a less powerful joint			2
the thinking is that when people smoke high - potency cannabis , they compensate for the potency by inhaling less smoke			1
but now this theory has been partially debunked by researchers			0
people who smoke high - potency cannabis take in more of the drug 's active ingredient , @entity17 if this was accurate , it would mean they experience the desired high while doing their lungs less damage			1
however , @entity23 research has now revealed this theory is not accurate			0
the scientists , who published their findings in the journal @entity28 , discovered that people who smoke high - potency cannabis inhale more of the drug â€™s active ingredient , @entity17			1
they say that while these smokers do reduce the amount of smoke they inhale , they still take in more thc than people who smoke lower potency cannabis			2
this is because of the higher @entity17 content of high - potency cannabis			1
as a result of consuming more @entity17 , they are more likely to become addicted to the drug			2
however , as they inhale less , they do take in a smaller volume of smoke			0
despite this , they still inhale harmful smoke			0
to make up for the additional strength of the drug , people who smoke high - potency cannabis inhale less			1
this means they take in slightly less harmful smoke to conduct the study , the researchers observed 98 cannabis smokers as they rolled and smoked cannabis of varying concentrations			0
those who made strong joints inhaled smaller volumes of smoke , presumably in an attempt to reduce the amount of @entity17 taken into the body			0
but these efforts were only partially successful , compensating for roughly half of the @entity17 strength			0
so , although smokers of strong cannabis alter their smoking behaviour to compensate for the higher potency , they do n't alter it enough to make smoking high - strength cannabis the healthier option .			1

the theory is that when people smoke high - potency cannabis , they compensate for this potency by inhaling less smoke
but they also take in more of the active ingredient - @entity17
this means they are more likely to become addicted to the drug
