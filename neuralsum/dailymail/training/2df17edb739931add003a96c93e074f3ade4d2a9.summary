@entity4 of @entity0 plays a forehand in his qualifying match against @entity32 's @entity9 @entity33 and @entity34 serves the ball during his practice session on saturday @entity4 , who is ranked 192nd in the world , took until midway through the second set to force a break point against @entity40 , who was playing far better than his ranking of 323 would suggest			1
but after breaking in the 10th game to claim the set , the 20 - year - old from @entity46 broke again in the decider and served for the match at 5 - 3 , only to lose his serve and allow @entity40 back into the contest			2
@entity4 still had the advantage of serving first however and recovered his composure to break again and seal victory in two hours and 23 minutes			1
' it is good confidence coming through grand slam qualifiers , you have earned your right to get into a grand slam which is a great feeling and gives you confidence going into the upcoming tournaments , ' said @entity4 , who turned 20 on january 8 and spent his present of @entity63 vouchers on acclaimed tv drama @entity64			2
' you are always looking to improve , that 's what i want to keep doing			2
it 's a good start to the year but that 's all it is , the year is full of ups and downs so you ca n't get too up on the results			2
' @entity28 and @entity27 of @entity0 pose with their @entity77 plaques back in 2009 @entity27 , @entity29 ( centre ) and @entity20 of cheer on @entity28 at the @entity81 in 2004 @entity4 and @entity19 have both benefited from spending time with @entity20 during his winter training sessions and @entity4 added : ' i do n't know how much you guys ( the media ) see of it but he really wants guys like me and @entity10 to do well			1
he 's texting to say well done and good luck and it 's a nice feeling when someone like that wants you to do well			0
' working with @entity20 in 2013 it was obviously a higher standard , so for me to play with him i was having to work really hard to win points			2
this year when i went back and played with him i felt a lot more comfortable with the balance and speed of play			0
i felt a good improvement from that year which is what you want			0
' @entity19 of @entity0 serves during his match against the @entity14 's @entity105 on thursday @entity4 beat home favourite @entity40 in three sets to qualify for the main draw on an adjacent court at @entity110 , @entity10 lost 7 - 5 6 - 3 to veteran @entity13 , the 36 - year - old using all of his experience to win each set with a single break of serve			1
' you ca n't play great every day , ' @entity10 said			0
' i felt pretty relaxed , pretty loose , but he played quite smart , used his slice well and obviously he 's very experienced and knew what he was doing on the court			0
' i just lost a bit of rhythm and he 's a very smart , very experienced player and it showed today			0
it 's tough to rush @entity120 because he defends very well			0
when i play eight out of 10 at this level it 's good enough , but my six out of 10 is n't good enough yet and that 's what needs to improve			0
' @entity10 lost in three straight sets to the @entity14 's veteran @entity13 in the last round of qualifying			0
