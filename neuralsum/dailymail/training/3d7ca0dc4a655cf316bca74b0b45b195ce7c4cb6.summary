on friday , she is to spend the day with @entity12 , the wife of @entity1 president @entity13 , something which diplomats hope will build bridges between the two countries			2
' @entity0 herself has been accomplished in areas such as women 's rights , children issues and education , and i think members of the @entity1 public are anticipating her visit with a positive attitude , ' @entity35 said			1
during her trip to @entity1 , mrs @entity0 will visit several schools and universities in @entity7 as well as hosting a roundtable on education and promoting exchange programmes			1
by her side will be her two daughters , but also her 76 - year - old mother @entity11			1
mrs @entity11 , the first live - in grandmother in the @entity55 since the 1950s , is the only living grandparent of @entity10 , 15 , and @entity9			1
@entity57 : @entity0 has taken both her teenage daughters as well as her mother @entity11 on the trip well dressed : ahead of the trip , mrs @entity0 's fashion sense has been compared with that of the @entity1 first lady , and she did not disappoint when she disembarked in @entity7 the girls were both in skater - style skirts , black tights and @entity9 wore trendy black - laced shoes the @entity6 is no slouch in the footwear department and wore thigh high black heeled boots true elegance : @entity0 and her daughters are met by @entity75 , the new @entity31 ambassador to @entity1 , as they arrive at @entity76 home team : mrs @entity0 is greeted by @entity75 , center , and his wife @entity79 , left , after disembarking she is a constant presence in @entity81 and @entity9 ’s daily lives , helping them with homework , taking them to and from school and caring for them when their parents are out of town			1
@entity55 officials hope that by accompanying her daughter and granddaughters , she will ‘ resonate with the @entity1 people , ’ as it is common for grandparents help bring up children in the @entity98 powerhouse nation			2
in @entity1 , and a majority of @entity98 countries , families keep multi-generational households and grandparents are seen as secondary care providers			2
‘ i think they understand the significance as well of family and of three generations of family traveling together , which i think the @entity1 will appreciate , and will appreciate the ties and the bonds that the @entity0 family have with one another across generations , ’ the first lady 's chief of staff @entity107 said			1
‘ this is a great opportunity for the @entity0 family to experience that , and i think for the @entity1 to see that as well in an @entity31 family			2
’ the president himself , meanwhile , appears to be suffering from empty - nest syndrome as he addressed an audience at the @entity55			0
‘ @entity0 and the girls are on their way to @entity1 , it 's very lonely at home , ’ president @entity0 said , according to @entity124			1
close knit : mrs @entity11 moved in to the @entity55 to help the @entity81 care for @entity9 and @entity10 , something which @entity55 officials hope will resonate with the @entity1 people two sides : @entity31 first lady @entity0 , pictured in february , will meet with her @entity1 counterpart @entity12 in @entity7 tomorrow born : january 17 , 1964 ( age 50 ) education : bachelor of arts in sociology ( maj ) and african american studies , @entity137 and @entity138 , @entity139 children : @entity10 , born 1998 , and @entity141 , born in 2001 job before becoming ' first lady ' : vice president for @entity145 and external affairs at @entity146			1
philanthropic work : ' @entity148 ! ' campaign to battle childhood obesity , lgbt rights advocate , promotes organic food and healthy eating born : november 20 , 1962 ( age 51 ) education : masters in ' traditional ethnic music ' from @entity158 children : daughter @entity160 , born in 1992 job before becoming ' first lady ' : after leaving @entity1 's @entity164 , she remains a famous patriotic singer and @entity166			1
@entity12 is a civilian member of the @entity1 army and holds major general rank			0
philanthropic work : @entity12 has served as @entity170 for @entity171 and @entity172 since 2011 @entity13 ( centre ) and @entity12 arrive in @entity174 in october last year			0
@entity12 's presence is unusual insomuch as wives of @entity1 leaders are rarely seen speaking ahead of a screening of @entity179 , a film about the life of the farm labor activist , president @entity0 showed that even the most powerful man in the world can get confused by technology			1
‘ i can not stay for the screening ; somebody 's going to get me the cd			0
or whatever , i 'm a little technologically challenged - the dvd ! ’ mrs @entity0 's trip provides an opportunity for the @entity31 president and @entity1 president @entity13 to cultivate a personal relationship through their wives following their meeting in @entity198 in @entity199 last year , @entity35 said			1
' such a personal relationship with mutual trust is crucial , as the @entity1 - @entity31 relationship has entered a more challenging phrase , ' @entity35 added			2
@entity12 , @entity13 's wife , accompanied her husband on the @entity198 visit but did not meet mrs. @entity0 , who stayed in @entity207			2
her absence left some @entity1 grumbling and the visit allows the first lady to make up for it			2
' i think this provides a natural reason to stay engaged ' before @entity13 and @entity0 meet again , @entity35 said			0
forever alone : president @entity217 , pictured on the @entity218 thursday , said it was lonely in the @entity55 without his wife and daughters the trip also gives @entity12 unusual prominence in a @entity1 official culture that usually keeps leaders ' spouses in the background			2
@entity12 , a popular folk singer , was better known than @entity13 before he became @entity229 leader and president			0
' she has a good presence on television , ' said @entity233 , a political analyst at the @entity234			0

' this is a formidable soft power @entity1 can use for the world to see @entity1 is not a monolithic society			0
' earlier today it emerged that @entity0 will not take questions from reporters or give interviews during her tour of @entity1 , and members of the press corps who usually follows the first family everywhere ca n't travel with her entourage			2
and although she will make a few speeches with reporters in the room , the picture is largely one of an expensive , taxpayer - funded tourism exercise for mrs. @entity0 , her two daughters , and her mother – not the official trip the @entity55 has projected			1
@entity55 press officials have n't comment on the record about whether a reported ban on question - and - answer interviews applies equally to @entity31 journalists and international reporters			0
limited information made available to @entity289 suggests that only two out of 22 scheduled events on the trip will afford journalists a chance to do any significant reporting			0
the @entity55 also indicated that the two events during the trip that are completely open to journalists will not see the first lady be interviewed or take questions , and they are marked ' space limited ' on her itinerary			0
' throughout the week she will participate in open press and pooled events including speeches at two schools , questions from students online and forums including a @entity309 , ' a @entity55 official told @entity289			0

@entity0 has arrived in @entity7 with daughters @entity9 and @entity10
