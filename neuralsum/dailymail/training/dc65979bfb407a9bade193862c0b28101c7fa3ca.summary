practices : the @entity1 has told the biggest payday loan firms to improve how they inform customers and chase debts payday loan giant @entity5 has increased the interest rate it uses to illustrate the cost of borrowing to 5,853 per cent – a rise of 1,600 per cent			1
the move has triggered more calls for tighter regulation of an industry that cashes in on hard - up borrowers			0
most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over until they get their salary			1
but lenders are required by law to give a representative annual percentage rate of interest ( @entity26 ) , setting out what the loan would cost over a year , so customers can make comparisons with other firms easily to find the cheapest deal			0
@entity5 used to give the example of a £ 207 loan over 20 days , with interest and charges of £ 47.42 and an apr of 4,214 per cent			1
but it now uses a new example of someone borrowing a smaller sum of £ 150 for 18 days , with interest and charges of £ 33.49 and an apr of 5,853 per cent			2
@entity5 has not actually increased its charges or interest rates , but says it has voluntarily changed the loan example it uses on its website as a better reflection of how customers borrow			1
the firm argues that the apr calculation , which makes assumptions about borrowing money over a full year , is not the best way to illustrate the cost of its loans to customers			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we made the change as the way our customers are using the service has changed			0
more are taking out shorter loans for smaller amounts , which , perversely , has the effect of increasing the representative apr. providing a clear and full cost up front is one of our responsible lending policies			0
’ how much ? @entity5 has pushed up its typical apr to 5,853 per cent but it says that customer 's will pay less short term fix : most customers of payday loan firms only take out small amounts over a short period to tide them over but lenders have to set out what the loan would cost over a year on its website , it tells customers : ‘ while shorter @entity5 loans cost less in real terms for our customers , this trend means a bigger representative apr. it ’s crazy but true			1
’ @entity5 and the 49 other biggest payday loan firms have been put on notice by the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) to improve the way they agree loans , provide information to customers and chase debts			1
interest : the projected apr for small @entity5 loans is considerable some customers have been given loans without proper checks that they are earning and can afford repayments			2
others have been allowed to roll over short - term loans several times , pushing interest charges to punishing levels			0
several firms have used heavy - handed tactics to chase debts			0
earlier this year , it emerged that a father killed himself after being harassed by payday loan firms demanding repayments			1
@entity119 , 36 , from @entity120 , burned to death after dousing himself in petrol and setting himself alight			0
a citizens advice study found the firms are fuelling debt and misery by lending to the vulnerable , including people who are drunk , the under - 18s and the mentally ill. its chief executive , @entity129 , said : ‘ high interest rates are just one of the problems people face when taking out payday loans – hefty charges , rollovers and having their bank accounts drained , leaving them in serious financial hardship and struggling to repay money they ’ve borrowed			2
