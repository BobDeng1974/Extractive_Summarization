by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity0 , 71 , lost her 33 - year - old daughter , @entity2 , to breast cancer 11 years ago			1
since then mrs @entity0 has been tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of the disease			1
she regularly visits prisons and other women ’s institutions to educate people about the signs of breast cancer			1
mrs @entity0 , from @entity12 , in @entity13 , has also raised more than £ 200,000 for @entity14			2
now , as mothers ’ day approaches , the retired radiographer pays tribute to her daughter			1
@entity0 ( left ) lost her daughter , @entity2 ( right ) to breast cancer when @entity2 was 33 ‘ @entity21 's day ! this is my best card of a horse ever for you ! ’ small , round , auburn haired , little red wellies on her feet and my riding hat jammed on her head , my youngest child , @entity2 - @entity32 - competed noisily with her elder sister and brother in the giving of cards and receiving of cuddles			1
it would be the same picture being enacted all over the country on that special day - and every @entity42 since - precious memories of love and laughter			1
@entity32 was born , two weeks late , on june 7 , 1969			0
i 'd spent some time in hospital during the pregnancy , due to a threatened miscarriage , so she arrived with determination to get on with life , against the odds			0
and that 's how her character continued to develop - always holding her own with her siblings , @entity55 and @entity56 , while they made a formidable , loyal and loving trio			2
she made her way through nursery , primary and secondary schools , making great friends while not overdoing the academic side of life ! mrs @entity2 found a lump in her breast when she was just 32 and was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
she had surgery to remove the lump as well as chemotherapy but the cancer returned and spread to her liver mrs @entity2 ( left ) died just 11 months after her initial breast cancer diagnosis			1
she is pictured with her mother , @entity0 , and sister , @entity55 she played first the violin , and then the @entity78 horn			1
she was in the school orchestra and she indulged the dramatic side of her nature in the annual musical - she was always an entertainer , fun - loving , outgoing and simply so loving			2
rather reluctantly , she went off to college , in the same city where @entity55 and @entity56 were studying , and it was much later that i heard about the rescues of @entity32 that the two of them had carried out , retrieving her from less than salubrious situations and returning her to her rooms			0
her social life definitely took precedence over her studies ! source : @entity14 after a year at college , she went off to @entity78 to spend the summer working for @entity97 and there the course of her life changed			0
she went to a camp site outside @entity102 for the season , with the intention of returning in october			0
but , as the date approached , she spoke more and more about the son of the campsite owners , with whom she 'd been working all summer			0
and that was how , at 19 , she found her soul mate , @entity111 , and @entity78 became her home			0
we , the family , spent so much time with them throughout the years - weeks of such joy , in the sunshine of the south of @entity78 , where her auburn hair turned golden and she became our @entity122 , our @entity123			2
just after her 32nd birthday , she rang to say she 'd found a lump in her breast and was having it removed the next day			1
@entity111 phoned , so distressed , from the hospital to say it was cancer and we went over at once to be with them both			0
when i look back on that fateful call now , i remember all the hope and optimism and determination they both showed , giving us the example we so needed			0
@entity32 received the very best treatment from that day on from specialists who would never give up their hope for her			0
during her first course of chemotherapy , a further lump was found in her breast and then she had a mastectomy , something that the surgeons had hoped not to have to perform on someone so young and so beautiful			1
since her daughter 's death , mrs @entity0 has campaigned to raise awareness of the signs of breast cancer			1
she is pictured ( left ) with her children - @entity55 ( centre ) , @entity2 ( second from right ) and @entity56 ( right ) - and her daughter - in - law , @entity153 mrs @entity0 said : ' i saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that , to us , were superhuman			1
' her children ( including @entity2 , right ) are pictured the last time @entity2 was able to go outside on @entity167 , 2002 , we were all in the mountains above @entity102 , @entity32 with no hair , dancing on the table and so full of @entity171 , so full of courage and optimism			2
in march of 2003 , it was found that @entity32 had developed secondaries in her liver			2
from then on , i saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that , to us , were superhuman			0
she never stopped thinking of others , even when so exhausted			0
the love that she and @entity111 had for each other , 14 years after they first met , had such an effect on us all through those last few weeks			0
on may 27 , 2003 , just eleven months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and at the age of 33 , @entity32 died peacefully , with @entity111 and all the family beside her			1
it was such a privilege to be with her at that moment			0
mrs @entity0 ( pictured with her three children ) wrote : ' i know that she is with us all forever , inspiring @entity191 to live life to the full and giving us her courage when we tire and her laughter when tears are too close ' as i had brought her into the world , so i was with her as she left her all too short life , leaving me with the gift of unconditional love that she gave me and the inspiration of her courage			2
she left so much undying love for her sister and brother and , for us all , the memories of her living life to the full , from the moment she and i shared her birth through her years with us , so full of love , fun and laughter			0
i miss her desperately every single day , i hear her voice saying ‘ hi , it 's me ’ on the phone , i see her swimming with @entity111 in the warm @entity219 waters and i know that she is with us all forever , inspiring @entity191 to live life to the full and giving us her courage when we tire and her laughter when tears are too close			0
on @entity42 , i shall think , as always , how endlessly blessed i am to have three deeply loved , amazing , supportive children , even though the youngest of them is now just out of reach , ‘ just down the road ’ , as @entity32 used to say , but whose presence fills my heart every moment			2
