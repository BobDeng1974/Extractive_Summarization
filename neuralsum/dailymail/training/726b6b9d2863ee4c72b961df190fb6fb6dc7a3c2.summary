@entity51 was established in 2007 by a single man with a passion : dr @entity57			0
he says : ‘ the formula we used is based on a paste developed in @entity61 called @entity62 – a blend of peanut paste , milk powder , oil and sugar – for palatability , and a mineral and vitamin mix that helps build muscle and active tissue , not just fat			0
