‘ in the @entity11 referendum , we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the @entity24 , ’ mr @entity0 will say			1
‘ after we won that referendum , we kept our promise , and agreement was reached – for the first time – between all five of @entity11 ’s major parties to give the @entity24 extensive new powers			1
‘ but as we go further in devolving powers to @entity11 , we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too			1
