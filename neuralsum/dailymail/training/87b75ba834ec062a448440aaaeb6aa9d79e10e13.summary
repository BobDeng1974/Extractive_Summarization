running 26th with just over 100 laps left , @entity10 blew a right front tire coming around turn 4 and slammed the right side of her car into the wall			2

' whenever those right - fronts go , they always hit hard because you do n't broadside , you hit more straight on , ' @entity10 said			0
' it took a hard hit both sides and i 'm fine , so @entity44 is doing a good job at safety			1
but no real good warning			0
the car was n't all that tight and most of the [ problems ] were in the rear , so there was no real vibration that told me that was going to happen			0
' @entity10 became the first woman to win a @entity56 pole and lead green - flag laps at the @entity58 last week , sending her popularity into a new realm			1
blinded : the impact with @entity15 's car caused the front hood to cover @entity10 's windshield , leaving her unable to see the track ahead bad luck : the flat tire that caused her to lose control of the car is seen on the side of the track the race is over : @entity10 and @entity15 sit idle on the track after the accident during the @entity77 at @entity9 she struggled with her car in qualifying at @entity9 , starting 40th , and had to make some major adjustments during the race after reporting vibrations in the rear near the midpoint			1

' everybody works hard and after last weekend , we just wanted to get these three races to get some solid points to re-establish the garage area			0
we 're parked in the dirt this weekend , so i really wanted my guys to get into the garage area			0
we 'll just have to get it at @entity98			0
' with not enough stalls at @entity9 , rookie @entity10 's team had to work outside the garage area			1
in the driver 's seat : @entity10 was unable to see the track ahead of her after the hood of the car covered the windshield in the collision debris : the crash left a huge piece of @entity10 's car lying on the track as her car was rendered disabled @entity117 wanted : @entity10 's crew members work on her @entity119 after the crash the crash comes just weeks after @entity10 became the first woman to take pole position at the @entity58			1
@entity10 also became the first woman to become the pole - sitter in any @entity44 top division event - the latest in a long line of achievements for one of the most prominent women in motorsports			1
@entity10 , from @entity131 , @entity132 , qualifies as a rookie as it is only her first full season in the sport - and became the first rookie to take pole since @entity138 in 2002			2
