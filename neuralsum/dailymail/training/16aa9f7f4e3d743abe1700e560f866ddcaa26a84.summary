captured : @entity3 officials have confirmed the capture of @entity5 , his family said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos though they seeked to achieve two very similar objectives - the killing or capture of high - ranking terrorists , the different approaches taken in the two saturday raids illustrate the versatility of @entity17 commandos			2
the @entity19 operation , a raid on a highly - fortified terrorist bunker on the coast south of @entity23 , used water and darkness to its advantage – but the @entity29 , @entity28 raid took advantage of the natural barriers provided by cornering the target in his gated community while parking a car			1
the @entity28 target , senior @entity37 member @entity5 , was quickly captured without a single shot being fired			1
officials are unsure if the @entity19 target , a high - ranking @entity42 member , was killed in a fierce firefight that ended when @entity44 retreated			1
accused of plotting the coordinated twin 1998 bombings of @entity46 in @entity47 and @entity48 that killed over 200 and injured well over 1,000 people , @entity5 , 49 , was captured rather simply , according to family members			1
the wanted man was parking his car outside his family ’s home in a gated community in @entity29 after morning prayers when three cars filled with armed commandos encircled him , said his sister - in - law			0
they jumped out , smashed his window and took his weapon within seconds			0
@entity5 was then extracted from the car and taken with the @entity67 soldiers as they fled the neighborhood , she explained			0
first said to be armed foreign commandos by the frightened woman , @entity3 officials later confirmed @entity5 ’s capture			2

no special vehicles were used in the capture , a stark contrast to the @entity19 raid			1

above , a stock image of @entity44 the beachfront home is known to house high - level terrorists and was notably the most - recent known address of @entity97 , an @entity42 leader who claimed responsibility for last month ’s @entity100 terror attack in @entity101 , @entity47			2
using silencers , the @entity44 opened fire on the beach house exactly two weeks to the day the @entity100 siege began			1
it is not clear how many seals were involved in the dramatic raid , but they were soon engaged by the terrorists in a loud firefight that startled neighbors and forced the withdrawal of the @entity3 commandos			2
witnesses said 12 @entity42 militants were in the home at the time of the attack , likely staying before deploying to a mission abroad			0
@entity19 government officials said one person died in the attack , local police claimed seven men were killed , according to @entity124			1
off the boat : the seal team attacked a beachfront house in the coastal town of @entity84 , which was the last known home of the leader of @entity42 ' we were awoken by heavy gunfire last night , we thought an @entity42 base at the beach was captured , ' @entity130 , a mother of four , told @entity124			2

the attackers left weapons , medicine and stains of blood , we chased them			0
' @entity3 officials have been unable to confirm the death or the identity of the wanted terrorist			0
the @entity100 siege lasted three days and resulted in the deaths of 69 people .			2
