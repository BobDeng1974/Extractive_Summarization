last week , more than 117,500 people in the @entity1 were left without power after a massive storm made landfall in @entity5			2
while states such as @entity5 have to deal with power outages relatively frequently , a new @entity7 study suggests other metropolitan areas could soon be heading for the same fate			2
researchers in @entity13 created a computer model that predicts @entity15 , followed by @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are at severe risk of being left in the dark			1
researchers in @entity13 have created a computer model that predicts @entity15 , followed by @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 as being at severe risk of being left in the dark the model combined , data on the risk of severe weather patterns as a result of climate change , along with information on the vulnerability of power grids			1
there is good news for people living in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity39 , whose future risk of outages is unlikely to dramatically change			1
@entity42 , a professor in the university 's @entity43 , said his team 's analysis could help metropolitan areas better plan for climate change			0
pictured is the 100 - year fraction of customers without power for metropolitan areas of @entity15 and @entity55			1
the colours show the scenarios of varying storm intensity this graph shows the scenarios for landfall loss			0
to create the landfall scenarios , the first divided the entire coastline into segments labelled 1 to 98 , starting at the @entity67 border and ending at the @entity70 - @entity69 border			0
landfall 2 spreads the distribution out more , @entity73 focuses more on the @entity74 , @entity75 shifts the distribution towards the mid-atlantic , landfall 5 concentrates more on the @entity81 peninsula 1 - @entity15 2 - @entity16 3 - @entity17 4 - @entity82 5 - @entity83 6 - @entity84 7 - @entity85 8 - @entity86 9 - @entity87 10 - @entity88 ' we provide insight into how power systems along the @entity74 and @entity93 coasts may be affected by climate changes , ' said professor @entity42			1
' if i 'm mayor of @entity87 , we know about hurricanes , we know about outages and our system has been adapted for it			0
but if i 'm mayor of @entity16 , i might say , " whoa , we need to be doing more about this			2
" ' not surprisingly , lead author of the paper , @entity104 , found results depend strongly on location			0
if climate change intensifies hurricane activity , some areas of the @entity7 would feel the impact more than others			0
cities already in the eye of the storm , such as @entity87 and @entity88 , would remain so			0
but cities such as @entity15 and @entity16 , as well as some more inland urban areas , would likely be increasingly susceptible to more frequent and intense storm activity , the team found			1
mapped landfall scenarios , with red showing the highest probabilities of a virtual storm making landfall in the east stretch of coastline			0
probabilities are annual probabilities of landfall in each segment a map from @entity129 reveals the widespread outages on thursday thanks to a powerful storm that forced nearly 100,000 @entity132 to get ready for work in the dark for both @entity15 and @entity16 , the 100 - year storm scenario - which is the level of storm impacts expected to be exceeded on average once every hundred years - would be 50 per cent higher			1
1 - @entity138 2 - @entity36 3 - @entity37 4 - @entity38 5 - @entity39 in that same type of 100 - year storm situation , the researchers predict about a 30 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in @entity87 and @entity88 relative to current climate conditions			1
in more geographically protected cities , such as @entity150 and @entity55 , there would be about a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers without power in the 100 - year storm			2
' the range of results demonstrates the sensitivity of the @entity7 power system to changes in storm behaviour , ' professor @entity42 said			0
' infrastructure providers and emergency managers need to plan for hurricanes in a long - term manner , and that planning has to take climate change into account			0
' for both @entity15 ( pictured ) and @entity16 , the 100 - year storm scenario - which is the level of storm impacts expected to be exceeded on average once every hundred years - would be 50 per cent higher			1

@entity15 is most likely area to be severely impacted by power cuts
@entity15 is followed by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity83
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 are the least likely to be affected
@entity176 came to the conclusion using computer models
these combined data on power grid strength and risk of severe weather
