need for speed : @entity8 , pictured with her 15ft dragster , cruised through her driving test a day after turning eight she is still nine years away from the @entity3 's road - driving age limit , but in the meantime the tiny blonde can speed down tracks as the minimum legal age to get behind the wheel is eight			1

until she turned eight , she had never driven a dragster , but after just an hour 's tuition she sped through her test			1
' it was amazing to get in the car and drive it all on my own , ' said @entity8 , who has to wear specially made fireproof overalls when she races			2
' i was really scared because at the end of the track you have to turn a corner and if you go too fast the car can tip over			2
' it was quite hard to steer at first and keep the dragster going straight , but i soon got used to it			0
' i love going really fast and all my friends are very jealous			0
they ca n't believe i get to go racing			0
' @entity8 is following in the footsteps of older sister @entity49 , who began racing 18 months ago when she was 11			2
' i love going really fast ' : @entity8 's car , which can accelerate to 50mph in 12 seconds , has been adapted so her tiny legs can reach the pedals the girls , who also enjoy cheerleading , became interested in the high - speed motor sport three years ago when the family moved to @entity57 in @entity58 - just 10 minutes drive from the famous @entity60 track			1
the family went to a fireworks display at the track , but it was the racing the girls enjoyed and soon they were dragging their dad @entity66 there every weekend to watch			0
@entity66 and his wife @entity68 , 32 , bought @entity49 a second - hand car on her 11th birthday and months later she won the @entity71			0
now @entity8 hopes she will be equally successful			0
pint - sized racer : @entity8 brings her dragster back to the pits at the @entity60 track in @entity58 ' i do n't know where the girls get it from as no one else in the family races and until now i have n't been into it , ' said @entity66 , 38 , a senior manager			2
' i never dreamed that with two young girls i would be spending my weekends at the race track			0
' it is not what i expected them to be interested in , but they are obsessed by the sport so i want to support them			0
' @entity8 has been looking forward to this moment for the last 18 months and recently she 's been sitting in her car and we 've been pushing her around			1
' i am worried about them racing such fast cars , but we reluctantly agreed for @entity49 to do it so we 've got to give @entity8 a chance too			1
' it is nerve - racking to watch them and does n't get any easier			2
' @entity8 is using @entity49 's old car , which has been specially adapted so her legs can reach the pedals			1
rising star : @entity8 was due to compete in the @entity3 national finals today at the @entity60 against competitors twice her age she had to do three observed runs in front of race directors at @entity60 in order to pass her driving test and get her licence			1
' @entity8 has been helping to clean @entity49 's car and checking the tyre - pressure , so she could n't wait to actually get in and drive it , ' added @entity66			1
' i took her go - karting last week to get used to the steering , but she had never actually driven a dragster before			0
' her reaction time was 0.02 seconds which would put her in the top five in a competition			1
' amazingly @entity8 succeeded in qualifying for the @entity3 national finals , which are being held today at @entity60			1
race officials said she was the youngest ever junior dragster to compete in a @entity3 national event			1
