@entity0 has launched an independent investigation into claims that a ' superhead ' close to former education secretary @entity4 knew about inspections weeks in advance			1
sir @entity7 , the chief inspector of schools , said fresh emails have come to light regarding three @entity12 schools all overseen by @entity13			1
the academies involved in the allegations are @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
@entity0 has launched an independent investigation into claims that ' superhead ' @entity13 knew about inspections at three schools weeks in advance by law , schools can only be given half a day 's notice of an inspection , but in august it was claimed the schools knew days , sometimes even weeks , before inspectors were due to visit			1
in a statement , sir @entity4 said : ' the ongoing claims that have been made about certain schools in @entity12 being given advance notice of @entity0 inspections are very serious			1
' it is vital that the public has absolute confidence in the integrity of the inspection process			0
that is why i immediately asked sir @entity43 to examine these allegations when they first surfaced in august			0
' sir @entity43 conducted a thorough investigation , which included 39 interviews with relevant parties and visits to the three academies in question			1
but i made a public commitment that should any additional evidence come to light , i would have no hesitation in bringing in someone from outside @entity0 to examine this			1
sir @entity7 ( left ) , the chief inspector of schools , said emails have come to light regarding allegations about @entity62 who was executive of the @entity63 , which at the time oversaw all three academies ms @entity66 was principal of the @entity16 and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by @entity0 , and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated ' for the avoidance of any doubt , i will be asking this independent reviewer to examine all the evidence originally considered by sir @entity43 and to establish whether his findings and recommendations still stand in the light of the new email evidence that has now emerged			1
' the announcement came after the @entity81 presented @entity0 with a further set of emails which suggested @entity84 discussed the timing of inspections with members of the inspectorate			1
in an email conversation between @entity62 and a consultant for the @entity92 in july 2013 , they discuss an inspection date for @entity94 in @entity17			0
ms @entity66 says she is due to meet the deputy director of @entity0 in the east of @entity97 , @entity98 , that evening			2
the allegations are also thought to include @entity18 in @entity12 , also overseen by the ' superhead ' and in another email exchange with a @entity103 official in may 2014 , @entity62 claims she has received a promise of an inspection in the autumn from @entity98			1
ms @entity66 writes : ' between us @entity98 has promised they 'll come back in @entity109 but what a waste of time really … and if it can happen to me then imagine schools with less experience … ' the original report into the claims was carried out by @entity0 's director of quality and training , sir @entity43			1
it concluded @entity13 , chief executive of the @entity63 , which at the time oversaw all three academies , was mistakenly copied into an email containing an inspection schedule			1
a spokesman for @entity13 said : ' these emails are being quoted out of context			0
in both cases , @entity13 was following @entity0 guidelines and any suggestion that she was lobbying @entity0 improperly is false			2
' in the first email to an educational consultant , she discussed an potential @entity0 inspection of @entity135 , which was in the process of being taken over and converted into @entity137 by the @entity63 to improve educational attainment			1
@entity0 's guidance recognises that in these circumstances , with a change of leadership , an inspection may not be appropriate			2
' in the interest of transparency and ensuring the change happened in the best interest of pupils and parents , @entity13 explained the situation to @entity0 and they noted her views			2
' however , in line with their regulations , @entity0 on behalf of @entity0 did not divulge what effect this information would have on their decision whether or not to inspect the school			2
' in the second email , @entity13 expressed her disappointment with the result of an inspection , which rated @entity19 as good with outstanding leadership			0
' she had hoped to show it was an outstanding school , but @entity0 indicated that one of the key factors they could not award that rating was the fact that exam results were not yet available			2
' @entity13 considered requesting a second inspection to confirm high or improving standards , and it was confirmed to her by @entity98 that she was entitled to do so under @entity0 's rules			2
in the event , this second inspection was not requested			0
again , this is entirely normal practice and in line with @entity0 rules			0
' we welcome the independent review of the original @entity0 investigation announced by sir @entity7 , which we are confident will lay to rest these false allegations once and for all			1
' dame @entity13 discussed an upcoming inspection date in an email conversation with @entity183 from the @entity63 in july 2013 , released by the @entity81			0
on 4 july 2013 , @entity62 said : ' do you think it would be better if they were inspected before sept ? or not ? be good to get your advice as speaking with @entity189 this evening on other matters			0
' ms @entity183 responds 20 minutes later saying : ' i am worried that it is late in the year and @entity0 is pressed to finish its normal inspections			1
i would hate for a scratch team to go in and give it @entity196 [ a ' requires improvement ' rating ]			0
that could pull the rug out from under your plans completely			0
' i would try to get a deferral till late in the spring term ( the likely rise in maths @entity208 results should give you a good argument for @entity98 , if you need one ) by which time the school could be moving rapidly in the right direction			0
' two days later , @entity84 replies to @entity183 , saying : ' spoke to @entity189 who agrees with you re below & has noted			0

chief inspector of schools said fresh email evidence has come to light
leaked emails suggest @entity222 knew about inspections
she was in charge of three academies in @entity12 at the time
@entity0 has announced an ' independent figure ' will conduct an investigation
