by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity4 11 - year - old @entity3 got a second chance at life last year when she received a new set of lungs from an adult organ donor , becoming the exception to a nationwide rule			1
before @entity3 , children under 12 were only allowed to receive donations from other children but on monday the @entity15 voted and changed the policy			1
now all sick children may apply to receive adult organs , giving them a better shot at recovery			2
@entity22 : lung - transplant recipient @entity3 speaks during a news conference on monday , june 23 , 2014 , at her home in @entity25 , @entity4			1
@entity3 and her parents offered comments after a national transplant board voted to permanently allow children the opportunity to apply for adult organ donations guardians : @entity3 's parents sparked a national debate last year when they protested to get their daughter onto an adult donor list , after she was given just weeks to live			1
@entity3 is pictured above flanked by father @entity37 ( left ) and mother @entity38 ( right ) the little girl spoke about the crucial piece of legislation at a press conference outside of her family 's @entity25 home on monday			1
she called the rule change ' great ' before wading into the more kid - friendly topic of summer			1
' we do school work with mom and dad and we go to the pool and we go to some parks , ' she said			0
just a kid : @entity3 also talked about her summer , saying she was enjoying going to the pool and playing in the park @entity3 's case sparked national debate last year when doctors gave the cystic fibrosis patient just weeks to live			2
at the time , the 11 - year - old was only eligible to receive an organ from another child and child organ donations are rare			1
in a last ditch effort , her desperate parents launched a public campaign to get her on the adult list and a federal judge agreed - handing down a court order to halt the under 12 rule			1
the ruling was a success since @entity3 has just breathing on her own for the first time in three years			0
@entity3 returned to the hospital on the first anniversary of the controversial transplant to have a tube in her neck , which had been used to connect a ventilator , taken out			2
new lease of life : a year after receiving the life - saving transplant , @entity3 had a tube removed from her neck and she is able to breath on her own in a statement , her family called the lawsuit ' the absolute last resort ' after other appeals failed			1
' we believed making lungs from donors 12 and older available to children under 12 who are good candidates to receive them was the right thing to do			0
we very much appreciate that the medical community ( now ) agrees with that , ' the family , including parents @entity38 and @entity98 , said			0
the lung transplant issue only affects about 20 children a year , making it difficult to study outcomes , the network said			0
a dozen children have asked to be added to the adult list under a waiver this past year , but most are still matched with donor lungs from children , the transplant network said			2
@entity3 with her mother and father who launched a campaign get her access to the adult donor waiting list			2
eventually they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult lungs plight : @entity3 had been a top candidate for organs from a child donor but such donations are rare ' any allocation policy must weigh the unique needs and circumstances of transplant candidates with the benefit a transplant can provide them , ' said dr. @entity134 , secretary of the network , a private nonprofit group that manages @entity138 organ allocation			1
' this is a difficult balance for very young lung transplant candidates in particular , ' @entity134 said			0
' the progression of their lung disease may be considerably different from other patients , even those just a few years older			0
' lung transplants are not a cure for cystic fibrosis but can buy time			0
the typical life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients is 37 years and continues to rise as new medical advances are developed			0
the case raised questions among some health specialists and medical ethicists about how organ donation rules are developed and under what circumstances they might be disregarded .			0

the 11 - year - old started a nationwide debate last year when she was allowed on an adult organ donor list
on monday , the @entity15 voted to allow all children to be eligible for the same kind of donation
before @entity3 , children under the age of 12 were only allowed to receive donations from other children
