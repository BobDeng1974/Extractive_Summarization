by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 06:49 est , 8 may 2012 it was given the name of @entity3 but , as these pictures prove , this statue 's time in the spotlight was more of a temporary arrangement			0
for the artist , it may well have brought a pang of sadness to see his 26 - ft sculpture dismantled from its spot in the middle of @entity16			1
however , others in the @entity16 will no doubt be glad to see the back of a statue which has been described as one of the worst public art eyesores			1
dismantling of an icon : the @entity3 sculpture by @entity24 is separated for disassembly in @entity16 hanging in the balance : a worker prepares the statue 's removal by placing a rope around @entity3 's neck ( left ) , while another worker holds it steady ( right ) @entity3 : despite the statue 's name , it 's stint in @entity16 has come to an end since it was unveiled last july the enormous tribute to the movie icon - titled @entity3 by artist @entity24 - was dismantled yesterday after going on display in the @entity16 last july			2
however , following an initial bemused curiosity , the statue has since been mocked and criticised in equal measure			0
it has been panned as one of the world 's biggest eyesores and was , at one time , ranked number one on the @entity51 website 's top ten list of worst public art. the statue , under which passers - by can freely gaze up the screen siren 's skirt , captures the iconic moment in @entity58 when the movie star bashfully held her dress down as a gust of wind billowed the fabric around her			1
however , it has come in more useful as a giant umbrella , as scores of spectators have been using the huge structure as a safe haven to shelter from @entity16 downpours			2
the stainless steel and aluminum sculpture , which is 26 feet tall and weighs a whopping 34,000lbs , has raised a few eyebrows			0
not least because visitors to the plaza are at once confronted with @entity78 's pert bottom in gleaming white panties and her perfect pins bedecked in white , open - toe kitten heels			0
' crude ' : people were able to look directly up @entity3 's dress ... and some even used it as a shelter to protect themselves from the rain panned : the statue ( pictured , left , being dismantled and , right , as a tourist attraction ) was described as one of the world 's worst public art eyesores in pieces : the 26 - foot statue , based on a scene from the movie @entity58 , was taken down after being on display since last july detractors have found so many things to criticise about this work that it 's hard to know where to start : its 26 - foot size ; its impropriety given that the movie to which it pays tribute - 1955 's @entity58 - is set in @entity107 ; and its perceived crudeness given that viewers are able to look directly up her dress			1
@entity112 wrote on @entity113 after the statue â€™s unveiling was a ' creepy schlock from a fifth - rate sculptor that blights a first - rate public art collection			1
' but the @entity119 , which owns the plaza and now its statue , responded by defending the art work : ' [ @entity123 ] likes to bring in things that cause a conversation , ' said a spokesman from the company			0
' they might be controversial , but he likes art that makes people think			0

sculpture described as one of the worst public art eyesores is taken down in @entity16
