' the prince also had a look at his book ' my life in pieces : the @entity70 ' and was impressed by his drawings			1
' i think it struck a nerve with @entity2 - he 's a young lad and a lot of us were still reading comic books when we went off to war so i think people can relate to it			2

' @entity0 ( pictured centre with his arms folded ) and his army colleagues before the @entity70 in 1982 one of the drawings of the ships sailed by the @entity145 during the war by the artist , who also draws @entity25 for the @entity27 cartoon series and @entity63 for the computer game mr @entity0 said creating the book was an emotional experience after he contacted fellow veterans he had n't spoken with for over 30 years the book tells the story of a group of @entity69 ' thrown into the unknown and the untold tales from @entity158 ’s advance on the mainland towards @entity160 ' mr @entity0 hopes that the book will help other veterans to overcome psychological trauma that it can cause the book ' struck a nerve with prince @entity2 ' when he viewed at the exhibition			1
