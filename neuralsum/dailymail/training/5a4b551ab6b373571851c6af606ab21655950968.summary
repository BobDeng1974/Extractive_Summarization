by @entity0 summer is in full swing at the moment here in the @entity5 and i ’m loving every minute of it			1
i ’ve just started filming for the next series of made in @entity9 , and am definitely relishing the opportunity for sneaky sunbathing sessions between takes ! when the sun ’s out , i like to keep my make - up minimal if i ’m not doing anything special – caking on layers of heavy foundation in the heat is a definite no - no. so this week , i thought i ’d show you all a hair style that ’s perfect for this sunny weather			1
this casual fishtail plait does the job of keeping your hair off your face while being a lot more exciting than a bog - standard ponytail			1
this week made in @entity9 starlet @entity0 shows you how to get the summer 's hottest hair trend : the fishtail plait the plait was spotted on the gorgeous models at @entity35 ’s @entity34 catwalk shows and is a huge celeb fave , with boho babes @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 regularly spotted sporting the ‘ do			1
this super-versatile style is perfect for festivals or summer nights out with friends , but also looks great for glam events a la @entity46 in @entity47 ! although the style may look intricate , it ’s surprisingly quick and mega-easy to create			1
here ’s how … how to do @entity50 's @entity49 step 1 – tame your manefirst things first , brush through your hair to untangle any knots so you have a smooth finish to work from			1
the last thing you want when you ’re styling your hair into a braid like this is to end up with even more knots and tangles when you take it out ! one of my faves is the @entity65 ; the flexible bristles are great for detangling the hair without pulling or breaking			2
you can also apply some serum at this stage if your hair is particularly dry or frizz - prone – the @entity71 is a great shine - booster with a weightless feel so your hair does n’t feel overloaded with product			2
it is perfect for both day and night and is loved by boho babes @entity39 and @entity40 step 2 – prep @entity78 you can go as wild as you like with this , it all depends on how structured you want the end result to look pull all your hair over to the side you ’d like the plait to lie , and keep it in place with an elastic band – this ’ll make it easier to create your plait			1
then , to start the plait , tease the ponytail you ’ve created into two halves			2
with one hand , take a small section of hair from the outer section of one half of the ponytail and move it across to the other side – into your other hand			2
then repeat this movement with the other half of the ponytail ; take a small section from the outer section of the other side and move it across the hair into your other hand			0
continue the process down the hair , making sure you keep the plait tight as you do			0
do n’t worry if it looks a tad messy or uneven – that ’s what this look is all about			0
you ’re looking to create a casual , boho - chic braid , not choirgirl - style pigtails ! step 3 – @entity114 you reach the end , grab a small elastic band the same colour as your hair and tie the plait in place			0
then carefully use a pair of scissors to release the elastic band at the top of the plait – try not to snip your hair at the same time ! @entity126 @entity128 @entity127 @entity129 24 hour body @entity130 @entity131 hold @entity132 step 4 – finishing touchesuse your fingers to loosen the plait in places where it looks too neat , and to add volume at the crown			0
you can go as wild as you like with this , it all depends on how structured you want the end result to look			0
if you ’re after some serious volume , sprinkle a dash of @entity146 into your palms and rub into the crown			0
to finish , spray the plait and the top of the head with hairspray to hold the style			0
i ’ve used the @entity156 ; it provides a flexible , workable hold ideal for a plait like this – plus it smells amazing ! enjoy fun in the sun and see you next week girls ! @entity50 xxx			1
