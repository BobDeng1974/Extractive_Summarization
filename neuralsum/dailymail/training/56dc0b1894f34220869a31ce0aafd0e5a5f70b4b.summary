by @entity0 failed : @entity1 first detected @entity3 's cancer when she was admitted to hospital in september 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall a hospital has apologised after doctors failed to treat a great - grandmother 's cancer - even though they detected a tumour eight months before she died			1
@entity3 , 66 , died from pneumonia 12 hours after being admitted to the @entity12 in may			1
but her family were only told that she had cancer , which hospital staff detected in september 2013 , hours before she died - despite asking for details on her deteriorating condition			1
medical staff revealed that the tumour had been picked up in a chest x-ray taken when the grandmother broke her arm eight months earlier and that no one had acted on the discovery			1
mrs @entity3 's son @entity24 , 45 , and partner @entity25 , have spent months trying to find out why no one acted on the tumour when it was detected			1
sales assistant @entity29 , 39 , said : ' she just deteriorated from an independent woman into someone who could do very little			0
' the doctors apologised but i wonder what it would ’ve been like for them if they had to watch someone they loved wish she was dead for the last five weeks of her life			0
' she ’d lost all of her dignity			0
she was so thin you could see the bones sticking out of her			0
' mr @entity46 added : ' we never got the chance to tell her she had cancer before she died			0
' mrs @entity3 , a grandmother of six and great - grandmother of five , was admitted to the @entity52 in september 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall			1
the 4.4cm tumour was picked up by a chest x-ray , which was carried out because doctors thought she might have had a chest infection			1
but the information was never shared with mrs @entity3 , her family or any other hospital departments and after treatment for her broken arm , she was discharged			2
in the following eight months she became increasingly frail was eventually admitted back to the hospital with pneumonia			1
apology : bosses at @entity52 apologised for failing to act after a chest @entity68 detected mrs @entity3 's cancer and said they had investigated the situation surrounding the failure following her death mr @entity46 and miss @entity25 met with @entity74 trust bosses who gave gave them the details of a full investigation into what had happened			1
they apologised to her family , who say they are considering legal action , and pledged that lessons must be learned			0
mr @entity46 , who works as a customer manager , said : ' she could have had a couple of extra months with us at least if this was picked up			0
questions : mrs @entity3 's son , @entity24 and his partner @entity25 , pictured , have spent months trying to find out why no one acted on the tumour ' for the last part of her life , we could have had help and support from people like @entity97 nurses if we ’d known she had cancer , but we did n’t and the pain and sorrow we feel is terrible			1
' another thing we wonder is how many people this has happened too			0
' a report by @entity105 pathologist dr @entity104 , stated : ' it is certainly possible that the tumour had already spread at the time of the first x-ray			2
' she added : ' it may be likely that some form of palliative therapy would have been offered			0
' it is likely that ultimately the cause of mrs @entity3 ’s death would have remained the same even had the tumour been identified sooner with bronchopneumonia representing the terminal event			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity121 said : ' we would like to extend our sympathies once again to mrs @entity3 ’s family on their sad loss			2
' we have investigated the circumstances surrounding the failure to review mrs @entity3 ’s x-ray and have met with her family to discuss the findings and to apologise for this error			2
' clearly in any investigation like this there are always lessons to be learned and we have , and will continue to , review our processes to minimise the risk of a similar incident happening in the future			0

@entity3 's tumour was detected by chest x-ray in september 2013
but she was discharged from @entity52 without being told
she became increasingly frail and was *readmitted* with pneumonia in may
died 12 hours later and family were only informed about cancer hours before
report said it was ' likely ' early identification would not have *prevented* death
