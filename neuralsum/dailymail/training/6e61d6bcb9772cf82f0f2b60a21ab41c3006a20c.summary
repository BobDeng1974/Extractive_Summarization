with coloured banners , saluting soldiers and the national anthem playing loud and clear , @entity0 threw a birthday party yesterday for its newest city - on a tiny island in the very middle of the disputed @entity8			0
@entity9 is on @entity10 , less than a square mile in size and not big enough to accommodate its own airstrip - which extends into the sea either side			1
it has a small permanent population of fishermen - the rest of its 1,000 residents are police , soldiers and government workers who work on the island in ' tours of duty '			0
but @entity0 is clearly proud of its new addition , and made a point that the world knew of its arrival			0
unlike most birthday parties , though , the neighbours were not invited			0
that is because @entity9 represents @entity0 's expanding toehold in the world 's most disputed waters , portions of which are also claimed by @entity54 , the @entity55 and @entity56			1
flying high : the @entity0 flag flutters above a government building in @entity9			2
it is one of the few buildings on the island , which is less than a square mile disputed region : the tiny @entity10 , which is too small to accommodate its own runway , lies around 220 miles from mainland @entity0 in the middle of the @entity8 @entity67 has created the city administration to oversee hundreds of thousands of square miles of water where it wants to strengthen its control			2
the @entity55 said it does not recognise the city or its jurisdiction , and @entity54 said @entity0 's actions violated international law			1
the @entity77 has also voiced its concern over ' unilateral moves ' in the @entity8 , where it says collective diplomacy is needed to resolve competing claims			1
@entity10 , formerly @entity10 , is 220 miles southeast from @entity0 's tropical @entity83			0
proud moment : @entity85 , the new mayor of @entity9 , will prteside over a band of local fishermen and a largely transient population of soldiers and government workers even the name of the island is disputed among its neighbours - @entity54 refers to it as @entity95			1
@entity0 approved @entity9 to ' consolidate administration ' over the @entity98 island chain , of which @entity10 is a part , and the nearby @entity101 island chain and the @entity102 - a large , completely submerged atoll that boasts rich fishing grounds that is also claimed by @entity56 and the @entity55			1
@entity54 and @entity0 both claim the @entity98 , and both would have to slug it out with the @entity55 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity56 to claim all or parts of the @entity101			1
@entity0 claims virtually the entire @entity8 and its island groups , and its disputes occasionally erupt into open confrontation			0
and it 's not just for the good fishing			0
the sea is one of the world 's busiest commercial shipping lanes , and sits on a potential mother load of oil and gas deposits			0
official broadcaster @entity120 aired tuesday morning 's formal establishment ceremony live from @entity9 , with speeches from the new mayor and other officials			2
plaques for the @entity127 and the @entity128 of the @entity129 of @entity0 were unveiled on a white - columned government building			0
mayor @entity131 trumpeted @entity9 's important role in protecting @entity0 's sovereignty			2
he said the designation of @entity9 as a new city was ' a wise decision made by the party and the government of @entity0 to protect the sovereign rights of @entity0 , and to strengthen the protection and the development of natural resources '			2
the official @entity143 reported earlier that @entity9 's jurisdiction covers just five square miles of land , including other islands and atolls in the @entity8 around @entity10			1
crucially , the jurisdiction also covers more than 750,000 square miles of surrounding waters			1
a few buildings ... and little else : there are few ' civilian ' buildings - a supermarket here , a hospital there - and fresh water has to be shipped in from @entity0 's southernmost province in a 13 - hour supply mission @entity160 and isolated : a former army officer overseeing the island before @entity9 was established described it as ' pretty simple ' , hot and humid with no fresh water communications array : despite the isolation , it is clear that @entity0 sees the strategic importance of @entity10 - a fact that has not been lost on neighbours @entity54 , the @entity55 and @entity56 angry neighbours : protesters hold banners during an @entity175 protest at the weekend			1
the banner reads , ' @entity98 and @entity101 belong to @entity54 ' - a reference to the island chains of which @entity10 is a part @entity10 translates to ' eternal prosperity ' , and @entity9 means ' three sandbanks ' - an apparent reference to the @entity0 names for the disputed island chains and @entity185 , @entity8 and @entity186 ( or @entity98 , @entity101 and @entity102 )			1
a description from a former @entity189 officer who was among the officials overseeing the island before @entity9 was established paints a picture of a harsh and isolated post where officials rotate staffing for a month at a time			2
@entity196 , director of the office in @entity83 overseeing @entity98 and other @entity8 territories , said : ' the living conditions are pretty simple			0
it 's very humid and hot , more than 30 degrees , and there 's salt everywhere			0
there 's no fresh water , except for what 's shipped in and what 's collected from rain water			0
' @entity55 @entity209 spokesman @entity208 said @entity210 had expressed its concern and registered a strong protest with @entity67 over the decision to set up a military garrison on @entity10			2
he said : ' the @entity55 does not recognise the @entity9 and the extent of its jurisdiction , and considers recent measures taken by @entity0 as unacceptable			1
@entity54 's @entity219 spokesman , @entity218 , said @entity54 had protested to the @entity0 foreign ministry as well			2
a statement said : ' @entity0 's establishment of the so - called @entity9 violated international law , seriously violating @entity54 sovereignty over the @entity98 and @entity101 archipelagos			1
' and @entity227 spokeswoman @entity226 said : ' we remain concerned should there be any unilateral moves of this kind that would seem to prejudge an issue that we have said repeatedly can only be solved by negotiations , by dialogue and by a collaborative diplomatic process among all the claimants			0
' as @entity0 was celebrating its new city , the @entity237 think tank released a report saying that the @entity8 was becoming an arena that could easily see armed conflict			0
its report stated : ' @entity245 claimants , with @entity54 and the @entity55 in the forefront , are now more forcefully defending their claims - and enlisting outside allies - with considerable energy			1
' the ' outside allies ' is a clear reference to @entity253 's move to influence the @entity245 balance of power by supporting @entity0 's neighbours			0
the report ominously concluded that ' tensions in the @entity8 could all too easily be driven to irreversible levels '			0
stuck in the middle : the @entity98 , of which @entity10 is a part , lie between @entity54 , @entity0 , @entity56 and the @entity55 in the @entity8			1

@entity9 has jurisdiction over 750,000 miles of surrounding waters
@entity55 and @entity54 refuse to recognise new arrival
@entity77 voices concerns , saying collective diplomacy is needed in the region
