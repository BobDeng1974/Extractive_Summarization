by @entity0 police have been taught to speak @entity2 in a bid to control tensions in a community flooded by thousands of @entity7 migrants			1
@entity8 in @entity9 has been the scene of violent clashes between rival groups of immigrants and locals for months			1
last month , former home secretary @entity15 called for urgent and tough police action in the borough - part of his constituency - to avoid riots			1
they are patrolling streets and learning to speak @entity2 now , a nine - strong team of officers has been enrolled in @entity2 lessons in the first of many integration measures			1
in a bespoke five - week language learning camp , the team went through basic phrases , verb conjugations , and key vocabulary			1
they also covered cultural references to help them connect with the district 's newer residents			0
operating from a new permanent base in the community , they will also be patrolling the streets seven days a week in a bid to engage with the community			0
a spokesman for @entity51 said : ' the community in @entity8 is made up of diverse residents , some of which do not speak @entity56			2
' a key part of a police team 's job is to engage and work with the community it serves to discuss any concerns they have and to work with them to tackle any issues that arise			2
@entity66 started to see an influx of @entity2 migrants when @entity26 joined the @entity69 in 2004			1
last year , the council estimated 1,500 eastern @entity7 @entity2 residents live in @entity9 around 500 - 900 live in the small @entity8 area			1
that figure has been revised up by hundreds since the government relaxed immigration rules in january , joining the @entity69 's move to allow all @entity7 citizens free movement			2
' in order to do this , we must be able to speak to local residents - which can be a challenge when a person can not speak @entity56			0
' to help stregthen our relationship with the @entity2 community in @entity8 , the dedicated police team there have learned the basics of their language so that issues can be dealt with more quickly and to allow our officers to better engage with residents			1
' the impact this has had has been overwhelming			0
simply being able to speak directly with people in a language they understand has allowed us to build trust and relationships between police and those who live and work in in the area			0
' tensions in the district came to a head last month when more than 25 @entity2 and @entity26 residents got into a street fight			1
a 17 - year - old boy broke his arm in the brawl , watched by dozens of residents lining the streets			0
mr @entity15 said at the time : ' we were all very apprehensive about the emergence of the long warmer nights , and recognise this was going to be a moment of pressure			2
' the police have devoted sufficient manpower and expertise , but what is required is a clear , visible presence in the evening , so there ’s no doubt in anyone ’s mind about the determination to clamp down on any kind of unacceptable behaviour			0
outbursts : police were called to a street fight in @entity8 involving at least 25 people last month ' it ’s fine having the numbers but they have to be there at the right time			1
those who perpetrate unacceptable behaviour need to understand the police mean business			0
' the cause of the problem is believing they can behave in this fashion			0
' since , @entity148 , secretary of state for communities and local government , haspledged to support the community and work with the local police in integration measures			0
residents welcomed the government support			0
@entity155 , 45 , who has lived in @entity8 for six years , said : ' the area has changed over recent years and we now have people hanging around on the streets			2
' but i think it is turning a corner with the police here all the time now			0
action : @entity15 ( left ) , mp for @entity9 , said urgent and tough police action is needed to avoid riots in the district , which @entity148 ( right ) , local communities secretary , has now pledged to deliver ' there used to be big groups hanging around , and young kids on the streets at all times of the day and night , but it ’s not as bad these days			1
' inspector @entity177 , who runs the new policing team , said : ' the police are working in partnership in @entity8 to address underlying issues , deemed necessary to alleviate any problems or difficulties			1
' very few of the issues are police related - crime is actually very low - but everyone working here appreciates we need a joined - up approach to get to the root cause of issues if we are to address and resolve them			2
' everything is about raising standards - improving housing , cleaning up the streets , creating more open space , providing more recreational opportunities - helping people to take pride in the area			0

nine - strong team in @entity8 , @entity9 , have been enrolled in @entity2 lessons
comes after *widespread* violence in district influx of @entity7 immigrants
