it may look rather more like a toy car than a hi - tech racing machine , but this mini-racer has become the world 's fastest electric car			1
called the @entity7 , and developed by @entity9 researchers , it broke the previous world record for acceleration by going from 0 to 100 km / h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres			1
the carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp ( 147 kw )			1
@entity19 each at a weight of 3.4kg			1
the planetary gearbox which is integrated into the upright transmits the torque to accumulated @entity24 at the wheels			2
the chassis is a one piece carbon fibre monocoque aerodynamics package produces enough downforce to drive at the ceiling at 110km/h			2
raced by the the @entity34 team at the @entity35 ( @entity18 ) , it beat the previous record of 2.134 seconds , which was held by an electric car built by @entity38			1
the new record was set at the military airfield in @entity41 , where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres			1
the new record - breaking vehicle is a @entity34 electric car that was developed and built in less than a year by 30 students at @entity47 and @entity48			1
the ‘ grimsel ’ is the fifth @entity18 electric car and the result of continuous development			2
the carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp ( 147 kw )			2
a four - wheel drive is implemented with four specially designed wheel hub motors , which generate a total torque of @entity58 at the wheels			0
by means of traction control , torque distribution is controlled individually for each wheel to maximise vehicle acceleration			0
no other production vehicle in the world has reached a similarly strong acceleration			0
the new record was set at the military airfield in @entity41 , where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres			1
the ‘ grimsel ’ celebrated numerous successes at the @entity34 international competition this summer			0
with more than 500 teams , @entity34 is the world ’s biggest competition for engineers and is held annually at various locations around the globe			0
with three overall wins and an average of 920 points out of a possible 1,000 , the ‘ grimsel ’ is @entity18 ’s most successful car			0
and with its victories in @entity87 and @entity88 , it achieved the two highest scores in the @entity91 history of @entity34			0
these further strengthened @entity18 ’s standing at the top of the @entity34 world rankings and demonstrated the potential in electric drive concepts .			0
