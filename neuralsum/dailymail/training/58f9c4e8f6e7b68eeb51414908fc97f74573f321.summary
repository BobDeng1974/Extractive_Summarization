by @entity0 published : 00:05 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 07:07 est , 25 january 2014 law enforcement officials in @entity3 say colleagues of convicted pedophile @entity5 were uncooperative during the investigation			1
@entity5 , 37 , an elementary school gym teacher , was convicted last month of sexually molesting an eight - year - old boy between 2006 and 2007			1
many teachers and administrators who had worked with @entity5 , who was sentenced last week to four years prison for second degree sexual conduct against a child and endangering the welfare of a child , refused to speak to investigators			1
supported : @entity5 , 37 , had the support of many staff members from his @entity3 , @entity18 , despite the accusation he molested a second - grader - a crime he was later convicted of according to @entity25 , 22 of @entity5 's co-workers wrote to the judge in support of the teacher during the case , some of whom said they would trust him with their own children and others who said they considered him a good role model for kids			1
the community was surprised and disappointed by the support of @entity5 and lack of sympathy for the young victim			1
' some of the people [ on the school staff ] who were cooperative told us there was talk at school , sort of like ‘ are you for the teacher or for the student , ’ ” @entity39 , the assistant district attorney who tried the case against @entity5 , told @entity51			1
' it was very disappointing to make contact with teachers who would n’t give us the time of day until they were instructed to			0
' i would say that , being in that position , they have a special duty to recognize issues and protect kids			0
i would think it has more do to with ignorance than anything else			0
' in court : lomaglio seen in court during his sentencing last week while people hug behind him the victim told his mother he had nightmares about being raped by his gym teacher , @entity5			1
the mother approached the school about her son 's growing fear of gym class and the unsettling descriptions of his dreams			1
@entity83 , the assistant principal at @entity84 at the time , testified in court that she met with the second - grader and his mother to discuss the issue but she did n't report the case to @entity89 because she did not believe there was credible evidence of abuse			2
the abuse finally came to light when the boy 's brother found a letter in his bedroom in 2012 , explaining how he had been abused by @entity5 and another sibling showed it to the boys ' parents			1
but building a case against the teacher was difficult when many close to the case who knew both the boy and the teacher refused to speak			2
' reprehensible ' : prosecutor @entity39 says the actions of @entity5 's colleagues in supporting him and ignoring the victim were inexcusable silence : many staff members at the @entity3 school where @entity5 taught refused to speak to investigators and prosecutors ' i would say that many teachers and administrators at several schools where this guy had taught would n’t talk to us at all , ' @entity39 told @entity25			1
' we ran into cold shoulders all the way around			0
they would say things like ‘ nothing happened here ’ and ‘ i do n’t know anything , i do n’t want to talk about anything			0
' one person even told a police investigator " do n’t call me again			0
" some were even rude			0
' according to @entity134 , @entity5 maintained his innocence during the trial but during sentencing acknowledged his guilt to a counselor			2
' they would say this never could have happened , ' @entity39 said			2
' this is why children do n’t disclose sexual abuse , because they believe the people who can help them wo n’t believe them			0
i found it reprehensible that teachers would behave this way			2
' to have so many teachers come out in favor of a man who admitted he did this , it was terrible to see			0
who can a kid go to ? '			0
