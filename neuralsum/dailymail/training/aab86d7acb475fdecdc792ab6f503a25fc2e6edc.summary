unjustly regarded as ‘ devil worshippers ’ on account of their unusual beliefs , the @entity0 have for centuries been one of the most persecuted minorities of the @entity8			1
@entity10 extremists regard them as infidels , worthy only of being killed			1
they are an ethnic @entity13 people who tend to have fairer complexions than many in the @entity8			0
they regard wearing blue as sacrilege , they never eat cabbage or lettuce because it creates wind and their men often have long beards and wear their hair in plaits – which make them resemble the cartoon characters of ancient @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
their reverence for fire and light derives from the ancient faith called @entity49 , the religion of @entity50 long before @entity10 arrived			1
they combine such @entity53 practices as baptism with @entity56 or @entity10 circumcision			1
like @entity58 they believe in perpetual reincarnation			0
but it is the central tenet of their religion that has led others to brand them devil worshippers			1
they believe in one @entity67 who illuminated seven angels with his light			1
the greatest of the seven is the @entity72 , known as @entity72 , who is dressed in blue ( which is why the @entity0 refuse to wear the colour )			2
his other name is @entity76 , @entity77 for the devil or @entity79			1
the @entity0 believe that @entity67 left the @entity80 in the care of the seven angels and told them to obey @entity83			1
the @entity72 refused , stating that @entity83 was created from the soil , and @entity67 ’s light could never be at the mercy of the soil			2
he was cast out for his disobedience , but was quickly reconciled with @entity67 who respected his argument – which proved he was , in fact , the most loyal angel of all			1
this is why the idea that he was akin to @entity96 is so misleading			0
tragically , the @entity0 are also victims of another misunderstanding , over their name			2
@entity100 extremists believe it derives from a deeply unpopular seventh century caliph – or leader – @entity104			0
tradition : @entity0 boys plait their hair , and older men wear long beards			2
their culture also prohibits cabbage keeping the flame alight : yazidi men are pictured above keeping the oil burning for one of their saints in fact , it comes from the @entity120 word for angel or deity , ‘ ized ’			2
their name simply means ‘ worshippers of @entity67 ’			1
yet no such theological distinction interests @entity128 fighters in a @entity8 where minor divergences between @entity100 and @entity130 are a matter of life and death , and the region ’s 12million @entity134 are diminishing by the day			0
in such a murderous atmosphere , ‘ @entity79 worshippers ’ are inevitably the targets of genocidal fanatics			1
even to ordinary @entity140 , they are seen as bogeymen to frighten children with			0
the @entity0 once lived in a wide area across @entity140 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
but successive waves of persecution - they claim to have survived 72 genocides - by the @entity153 rulers of what is now @entity140 , by @entity155 and now by @entity10 militants , have reduced the number of @entity0 from millions to an estimated 700,000			1
in recent years , some 70,000 have fled to @entity158 , where 40,000 live in western @entity159			0
since the @entity0 welcomed the @entity163 invasion of @entity140 after 2003 and admire @entity164 , they attracted the malevolence of @entity166 and other jihadists before the @entity128 came on the scene ; in 2007 massive truck bombs killed 500			2
what makes the @entity0 still more vulnerable is the insular nature of their community			0
no one can convert to their religion , you have to be born into it			0
they also practice endogamy – that is , they only marry members of the same faith			0
they believe that when someone dies , their soul passes into a new member of the community and that purification of the soul is only possible through continual rebirth			0
the worst possible fate , therefore , is to be expelled from the community because the soul can never then be purified or saved			0
equally , anyone who voluntarily leaves the religion risks death			0
in 2007 , it was reported that @entity199 , a @entity0 woman , was stoned to death for converting to @entity10 and marrying a @entity10 man			1
feared , villified and slaughtered for centuries , it is in many ways remarkable such a strong community of @entity0 still exists at all			1
but now , with the @entity128 ’s determination to wipe them out , they perhaps face their greatest test of all .			0

yazidi people are unjustly known as devil - worshippers by @entity10 extremists
they worship a fallen angel - who was later reconciled with @entity67
he is sometimes *confused* with the @entity10 and @entity53 @entity79
*intolerance* of their religion has led to centuries of persecution
once there were millions of @entity0 people , but estimates now sit at 700,000
