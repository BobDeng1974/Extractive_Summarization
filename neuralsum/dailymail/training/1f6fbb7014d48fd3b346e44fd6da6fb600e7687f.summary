house speaker @entity0 put himself one step closer to suing the @entity2 on thursday , unveiling a resolution permitting the move and attracting return fire from the @entity6			1
announcing late in the day that the legal action will focus on the @entity8 , @entity0 fumed that @entity9 had ' changed the health care law without a vote of @entity12 ' in 2013 , ' effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it			1
' the president , he carped , ' believes he has the power to make his own laws			0
' the @entity9 administration has taken several actions that @entity23 say twisted the plain meaning of the @entity8 law 's black - letter text , ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons			1
the law 's employer mandate , in particular , has been pushed back twice although the law reads that it ' shall apply to months beginning after december 31 , 2013			0
' buried : speaker of the house @entity0 criticized president @entity9 's economic policies during a press conference on thursday but announced his lawsuit plans later in the day as @entity40 lawyers and spokespersons started their evening commutes republicans ' actually plan to sue me , ' @entity9 mocked on thursday in @entity45			1
' really ? really ? for what ? you ¿ re going to sue me for doing my job ? ' the administration pushed it back by one year , burying the announcement in a blog entry			2
later , the @entity54 announced another one - year reprieve for some employers			0
the mandate requires most large employers to provide health insurance to their workers or pay a financial penalty			0
the @entity62 suggested in a july 2013 memorandum that it did n't intend to delay the legal mandate – just the requirement that employers report to the @entity67 whether or not they had complied			0
but without those reports , legal analysts have noted , there 's no basis for exacting any penalties			0
the @entity73 declared in 2012 that the @entity8 passed constitutional muster because the penalties amounted to a tax , a senior aide to @entity6 @entity23 leaders reminded @entity78			1
he said that because of that legal precedent , the @entity6 counsel is likely to argue that the @entity62 lacks the authority to pick and choose which taxes to collect in a given year			1
publicly , however , the legal nuance is less important to @entity23 than the broad - stroke declaration that president @entity9 has overstepped the boundaries of his constitutional box			1
' no president should have the power to make laws on his or her own , ' @entity0 said in a statement , drawing a quick retort from the @entity6 press office			2
' it is disappointing that @entity0 and congressional @entity23 have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt , ' read a statement press secretary @entity99 fired off an hour later			2
@entity40 does n't get much stranger : the @entity23 is preparing to argue before a federal judge that the president should be forced to retract delays in his medical insurance overhaul law , even though they sought he same kinds of delays during a showdown last year that landed the federal government in partial shutdown mode			1
' these guys ca n't take yes for an answer , i guess , ' a @entity111 @entity110 aide told @entity78			1
the concept of filing suit against the president has been in the works for months , according to the senior @entity23 leadership aide , but it gathered steam as @entity23 leaders began to realize that the @entity73 might give their potential case a boost			1
last week the high court ruled that @entity9 overstepped his authority with ' recess ' appointments of three lawyers to the @entity129 in 2012			1
the administration argued at the time that the @entity110 was n't in a position to consider the nominations because it was in a brief break from regular order			2
the @entity73 , however , ruled unanimously that the @entity6 lacks the authority to make that determination , and it 's up to the @entity110 to decide when it 's actually in ' recess			1
' the @entity8 law 's centerpiece is a requirement that employers with 50 or more workers provide medical insurance or pay a fine beginning on january 1 , 2014 -- but the @entity6 has already delayed that penalty 's implementation twice @entity0 erupted in anger at @entity9 on thursday : ' he 's been president for five and a half years -- when 's he going to take responsibility for something ? ' that decision could be a lifeline for republicans who aim to paint the @entity9 administration as lawless and dismissive of the @entity158 @entity157 's separation of powers			1
some democrats fear a series of similar legal rulings that would leave the @entity6 toothless during @entity9 's lame - duck years , and at the mercy of a coming @entity12 that threatens to be dominated by the @entity23			1
' if he files [ the lawsuit ] , it 's clearly going to be fast - tracked to the @entity73 , ' the @entity111 @entity110 aide said thursday , ' and given what we 've seen from them lately , that ca n't be good			1
' @entity0 's resolution is widely expected to pass easily in the @entity171 , along party lines			0
it would authorize him to file his lawsuit in federal court			0
once the legal complaint reaches a judge , @entity23 will have to grapple with the thorny question of whether or not they have legal ' standing ' to sue in the first place			2
in court , the @entity171 will have to show that it has suffered an injury – in this case , the nullification of its powers under the @entity157			0
it may also have to show that there 's no way to remedy the situation other than obtaining a court order that would hamstring @entity9			0
but the @entity6 does have the power to withhold the billions of dollars required to implement the @entity8 law – and the power to impeach the president			2
those options , says @entity193 , a lawyer advising @entity0 on strategy , are far too radical			0
the @entity158 @entity73 will llikely find itself arbitrating @entity0 's lawsuit once it wends its way through lower federal courts , a situation that concerns @entity111 since the justices have already unanimously ruled that @entity9 overstepped his authority in other cases @entity9 's speech thursady at the @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity45 was a partisan love-fest full of barbs at @entity23 who , he said , are doing little more than standing in his way ' impeachment is overkill for this particular transgression , ' she told the conservative @entity213 on saturday			1
' all @entity12 wants is for the president to faithfully execute the law			0
this does not mean that they think he should be kicked out of office			0
' @entity0 has cautioned that his lawsuit should n't be interpreted as a prelude to impeachment proceedings , drawing howls from tea party groups and conservative lawmakers in his own caucus			2
and using the power of the purse to stop all of @entity8 , @entity193 says , would penalize innocent people and organizations for what could amount to a petty punishment of the president			0
expecting @entity6 @entity23 to find their own remedy , she says , makes sense ' only when [ it 's ] proportionate and related to the transgression			2
' @entity9 , traveling in @entity45 for a string of @entity111 fundraisers , seemed to anticipate @entity0 's move on thursday during an economic speech in the liberal enclave of @entity206			1
' now , here ’s where it gets interesting , ' @entity9 said , discussing his ' year of action ' strategy to issue a series of executive orders in defiance of @entity12			1
' there are a number of @entity23 , including a number in the @entity45 delegation , who are mad at me for taking these actions			0
they actually plan to sue me			0
' ' you hear some of them , ' he said , drawing laughter and applause : “ @entity262 him			0
” “ impeach him "			0
' ' really ? really ? for what ? you ’re going to sue me for doing my job ? okay			2

@entity270 will authorize @entity0 to sue the @entity6 for changing the @entity8 without the consent of @entity12
the suit is likely to quickly land in the @entity73 , which ruled last week that @entity9 has overstepped his constitutional authority
' given what we 've seen from them lately , that ca n't be good , ' worried a @entity111 @entity110 aide
' you ’re going to sue me for doing my job ? ' @entity9 asked during a speech thursday
@entity23 say the *prospect* of a lawsuit represents a *defense* of constitutional authority that belongs to *legislators*
@entity111 insist that the @entity23 is *whining* about the same kinds of @entity8 delays that they demanded just a year *ago*
