@entity3 @entity2 captain @entity1 ’s frustration was rendered complete on sunday night when @entity4 produced a brilliant performance to upstage @entity6 and land himself an $ 11.44 million payday			1
the 27 - year - old @entity3 followed up his win in the @entity9 last week by claiming the @entity10 from under the nose of the @entity12 , which in turn earned him the $ 10 million ( £ 6.15m ) bonus for the @entity17 play - off series spanning four tournaments			1
almost $ 13 million ( £ 8m ) earned in eight days then , and his wife is due to give birth to their first child any day			1
@entity4 and @entity36 finished 1 - 2 in the @entity40 and are just what any @entity2 team is looking for , two men in the form of their lives			1
the problem for @entity1 , of course , is that neither will be at @entity48 next week			2
@entity6 said on saturday @entity1 must be kicking himself at the turn of events last week			1
he looked like he was about to say a lot more besides when he probably saw headlines appearing before his eyes and stopped himself			0
certainly the play of @entity4 and @entity36 stood in stark contrast to that of @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity1 ’s two wild cards who were competing			1
@entity6 got into trouble after a wayward tee shot on the ninth hole at @entity27 @entity6 ponders a tough shot from behind dense greenery and up against a fence @entity6 hits his third shot from an unfortunate lie after clearing the trees and finding the rough @entity6 was well in contention for the $ 10m @entity17 bonus coming into the final round @entity6 tweeted shortly after the tournament congratulating @entity4 asked about @entity4 in particular , @entity6 replied : ‘ you know , i ’m sure @entity1 is sitting at home kicking himself at the minute with some of the ... but anyways , he ’s playing great			1
’ the skipper ’s discomfort continued right to the end as @entity4 pulled off a series of dazzling strokes and holed some nerve - wracking putts for a success he thoroughly deserved			2
‘ why did n’t you play like this earlier ? ’ was the text an exasperated @entity1 sent him on friday night			0
what on earth must he be thinking now ? the key moment came at the 16th			0
@entity4 was just a shot ahead of @entity35 and looked likely to drop a stroke but holed a gutsy 20 footer for par. ‘ that was the golf tournament , right there , ’ said @entity4			1
there was a nice scene at the end as @entity6 embraced the winner on the 18th green			0
they had their differences once at the @entity105 but that has long since been resolved and here they showed a mutual respect			0
@entity36 finished the @entity10 four shots back and second in the @entity17 play - off series as is the case for @entity4 , @entity36 wo n't be competing in the @entity2 next week equal second finisher @entity35 pushed his fellow @entity3 @entity4 all the way @entity1 has left two of the @entity3 's most in - form players out of his @entity2 team ‘ i ’ve shown i can go toe to toe with the best player in the world and come out on top , and that ’s going to be huge for me going forward , ’ said @entity4			1
@entity122 ’s bid for his own £ 11.4 million payday to go with his priceless major championship wins over the summer fizzled out over the first 12 holes			0
after playing 25 of his last 27 rounds under par , it looked like 18 holes too far as he made a series of wild errors to fall from contention			0
he did rally with three birdies in a row from the 15th but was never going to catch @entity4			0
still , third place in the @entity40 earned him a tidy $ 2 million bonus to go with all the other riches he has claimed this year			2
as for @entity140 and @entity57 , they finished the week in tied 23rd place in a 29 man field after neither broke par in any round			2
they ’ll certainly be under pressure to deliver at @entity48 meanwhile , at the @entity147 on the @entity148 , @entity146 lived up the old adage of noted golfing author @entity150 that players in their thirties who have just fathered a male child are more likely to win by claiming his 13th tour victory - but his first since becoming a parent			0
the 37 year old @entity156 shot wonderful rounds of 62 - 66 at the weekend to win by a stroke from fellow countryman @entity159 , with two more compatriots rounding out the top four – @entity162 and @entity163			2
‘ first tournament as a dad and first win as a dad , ’ said an emotional @entity146 , whose wife @entity164 gave birth to their son on sept 1 .			0

@entity4 won the @entity26 and a £ 7m payday
@entity4 shot a final round 68 to win by three shots
he finished ahead of fellow @entity3 @entity35 and @entity6
@entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 were a further shot back
@entity4 and @entity3 @entity36 finished 1 - 2 in the @entity17 play - off series
the win follows @entity4 's success at the @entity9 last week
the 27 - year - old and @entity36 missed out on a *wildcard* place in @entity1 's @entity3 @entity2 team
@entity189 has won almost $ *13million* ( £ 8m ) in the past fortnight
