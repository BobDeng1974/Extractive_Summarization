by @entity0 more land in @entity3 is dedicated to playing golf rather than housing , new research has shown			0
prof @entity6 , researcher at the @entity7 at the @entity8 said green belts were driving up the price of houses and subsidising activities such as golf prof @entity6 said in @entity14 alone there was enough green belt land to build an estimated 1.6 million new homes with average densities			1
he said the land bank was about 32,500 hectares and could have an impact on the cost of homes in the region			0
according to new research by the @entity8 , more of @entity3 is covered by golf courses , such as @entity26 , pictured , than housing prof @entity6 of the @entity8 , pictured , describes green belts as ' a very @entity30 form of discriminatory zoning ' according to prof @entity32 , 2.65 percent of @entity3 is covered by golf courses which is greater than the area covered by housing he said green belts cover one and a half times the area of @entity30 than covered by towns and cities			1

' what green belts really seem to be is a very @entity30 form of discriminatory zoning , keeping the urban unwashed out of the home counties - and , of course , helping to turn houses into investment assets instead of places to live			0
