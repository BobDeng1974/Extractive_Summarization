the secret of whether a woman is expecting a boy or a girl may lie in her scent			0
research shows that lemur mothers - to - be carrying male babies smell differently to those carrying girls			1
the study , published in the @entity12 journal @entity13 , is the first to make such a link			1
the researchers swabbed 12 ring - tailed lemurs ( pictured ) to come up with their amazing findings and the @entity19 researchers say the same could be true in people			1
the scientists from @entity22 in @entity23 swabbed 12 ring - tailed lemurs before and during pregnancy			1
chemical analysis showed that the hundreds of ingredients behind the musky smell mellowed during pregnancy			0
and the biggest change occurred in those who went on to have male babies			0
it is thought that ‘ dramatic ’ differences in the mother - to - be ’s hormones affected the mother ’s scent			2
chemical analysis showed the hundreds of ingredients behind the musky smell mellowed during pregnancy it is n’t known why lemurs carrying males make simpler odours			2
but it may be a way of conserving energy because male pregnancies tend to take more out of the body			0
asked whether the same might apply in women , researcher @entity51 said : ‘ there has been a study showing that women ’s scent changes with pregnancy , but the authors did not address the issue of foetal sex and scent			2
‘ also unknown is whether others would actually be able to detect the changes			0
‘ but , in broad strokes , yes , there is reason to believe that there may be similar mechanisms across primates , including humans			0
’ @entity22 scientists say the same difference in the smell of pregant females could be true in people			1

study has been published in @entity12 journal @entity13
@entity22 , @entity23 researchers swabbed 12 ring - tailed lemurs
@entity19 scientists say the same difference could be true in people
