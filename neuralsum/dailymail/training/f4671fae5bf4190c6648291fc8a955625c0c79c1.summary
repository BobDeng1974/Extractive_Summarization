@entity3 , a junior at @entity4 , took the field on saturday as the @entity6 faced the @entity7 , even carrying the @entity9 flag as the team entered the stadium			1
and as if the fact that a man with a full time job and three children found time to play on a college football team is n't impressive enough , there is also the fact that @entity3 is 32 - years - old			1

still a seal instructor at @entity33 , he saved up his leave to attend the camp , and in the end it paid off , as the defensive end scored a spot on the roster			2
@entity3 became a seal in 2006 , and says he has operated in @entity41 , @entity42 , the @entity43 and @entity44			2
it was while in seal training that he met his wife @entity47 , with whom he has three sons all under the age of four ; @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity26			0
a little over a year ago , @entity3 decided he wanted to have a @entity4 degree , and began studying for the @entity53 , having previously attended a junior college			1

' i do n’t feel like where i ’m at today is some outstanding or amazing thing , ' said @entity3			0
' it ’s just more of a challenging route			0
