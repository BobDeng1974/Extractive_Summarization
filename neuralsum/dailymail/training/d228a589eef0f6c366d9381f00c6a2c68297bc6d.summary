suspended 2000ft above the ground , a @entity2 bride and groom were literally floating on air on their big day as they tied the knot on a hot air balloon			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , from @entity9 , exchanged their vows during the unusual ceremony , watched by a single friend			1
but it was n't all plain sailing , as the loved - up pair had had to keep their unique choice of venue a secret until the last moment in case the flight was cancelled due to bad weather			2
in the event , the only close friend to share the couple 's magical moment was @entity48 , a military chaplain who performed the ceremony			2
rather than sending their friends invitations to a wedding , the couple invited them to their house the following day to watch the footage of the quirky ceremony and celebrate their marriage			1
mrs @entity39 , a wedding photographer , came up with the idea after her new husband revealed he had planned to pop the question on a hot air balloon , but decided it was too expensive			1
' in my line of work i had seen so many different weddings and i did n't want to copy anyone else 's , ' she says			0
' i wanted to do something different			0
' the couple watch as their wedding venue goes up in flames - but only in a good way @entity10 's father was on the ground to give her daughter away before the balloon took off ' i wanted to do something i had never seen before			1
@entity82 told me that he had thought about proposing to me on a hot air balloon , so then i came up with the idea of getting married in one			1
he thought it was an awesome idea			0
' the couple married in august 2012 after dating for two years - but the soulmates had been friends since meeting during an @entity34 game at university in 2007			0
' we got a lot of great reactions from our friends and family , ' added the happy bride			0
' i 'm sure a lot of them thought we were weird for doing it , but i think after everyone watched the video they agreed that it was a pretty cool idea			0

' it really was the best day of my life			0
i loved when @entity82 was saying his vows to me because we were completely surrounded in a cloud of white			2
it was perfect , so still and beautiful			0
' we started the ceremony on the ground so that my father could still give me away , and only immediate family came to see us fly			2
