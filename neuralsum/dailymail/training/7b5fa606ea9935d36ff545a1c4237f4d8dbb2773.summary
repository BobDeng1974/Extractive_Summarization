by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 11:02 est , 2 may 2013 scientists have invented a ' suicidal ' satellite , attached to a giant sail , that can destroy dangerous space junk			1
the @entity5 , developed by the @entity6 , carries the satellite into orbit where it then attaches itself to floating debris			1
once a satellite has fixed onto its target , the large solar sails deploy and slows the speeding debris down enough so it falls out of orbit			0
this is an artist 's impression of what the @entity5 is expected to look like when it 's launched			1
the mini satellite can be seen in the centre of the deployed sail the mini satellites , weighing only 6lbs , are placed inside the giant sail			1
while in space , the satellites attach themselves to debris			1
the sail then opens , slows the debris down so it falls to @entity26 , and is destroyed by the atmosphere another plan to clear space junk was announced in april by @entity31 space company @entity30			1
@entity30 's plans would see a ' chase ' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target			2
using laser and radar guidance systems , a piece of space junk would be targeted , and then captured with a gas - propelled harpoon on a tether			1
once the space junk is secured , a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the @entity26 's atmosphere			1
then the chase satellite would then search out another target			0
the debris then burns up in the @entity26 's atmosphere - along with the 6lb satellite			1
there is said to be around 5,500 tonnes of floating debris currently orbiting the planet , travelling at five miles per second			0
scientists at the @entity6 have been working on the project , funded by the @entity59 space company @entity30 , for the last three years			2
it is hoped the first satellite , called @entity62 , could be launched by the end of the year			0
professor @entity64 , lecturer in altitude and orbit control systems at the university , believes the @entity69 satellite offers a cheap way of getting rid of space junk			1
it is an alternative to the more expensive method of shooting debris down with lasers			0
he said : ' there is a lot of debris in space and there is a need to declutter it			2
' we have had two collisions in the last three years			0
when that happens it just creates even more debris			0
as the sails deploy , they twist from around the satellite in the centre			0
once deployed the sail slows debris down until it can no longer orbit and falls to @entity26			2
it is then burnt off in the @entity26 's atmosphere this image shows the size of the @entity5 when it 's fully open			1
the sail is five metres long and five metres wide the mechanism for deploying the sail being tested at the @entity6 ' we are working on ways we can get the space sails to stick onto the debris			2
' there has already been techniques published on capturing space debris , like using nets or harpoons and those are two techniques we could use			0
' other people have been thinking about using robotic arms , but that could be expensive			0
' once the sails are on the piece of debris , it will decelerate quickly , burn up in the @entity26 's atmosphere and evaporate			1
' all the space junk around the planet is the result of 50 years of abandoning spacecraft			1
collisions with space debris can destroy expensive technology			0
such a collision could also see potentially large pieces of debris coming back down to @entity26			2
the build - up of debris - which is expected to grow at a rate of five per cent each year - is also believed to obstruct satellite television and other communications signals			0
work on the @entity69 project has been completed but needs extra funding before it can be launched into space			0
prof @entity64 said ' protecting our planet and environment is key for sustainable growth			0
' this is a novel , low cost space mission and can offer a low cost / mass solution to the problem			0
' it can be used for future satellites and launches and dramatically reduce the problem of space debris			2
' danger : with the debris in low - @entity26 orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph , even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts			1

satellites weighing only 6lbs are attached to the ' @entity5 '
they capture space junk and drag it to @entity26 , where it 's destroyed as it enters the atmosphere
