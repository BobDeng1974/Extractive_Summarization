drivers have faced bills of up to £ 800 to get their impounded vehicles back			2
the government abolished the paper tax disc ( pictured ) last autumn the @entity24 was accused of ' heavy - handed and draconian ' behaviour yesterday after figures showed its use of clamping rocketed by 60 per cent from about 5,000 vehicles a month before the changes to 8,630 last month			1
with no right to appeal against the fines to an independent body , drivers have little choice but to pay up			0

' @entity80 of the @entity81 said there had been only limited publicity from the @entity24 about the changes to the vehicle tax system			1
