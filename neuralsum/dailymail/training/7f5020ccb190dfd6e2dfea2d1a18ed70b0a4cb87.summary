@entity3 's latest injury while on international duty with @entity1 means the @entity5 striker has now been sidelined 11 times in the 20 months he 's been at @entity7			1
the 25 - year - old quickly became a fan favourite at @entity5 , scoring 36 goals in just 52 games following his £ 12million move from @entity13 in january 2013			0
his latest thigh injury , however , will keep @entity3 out of action for at least three weeks and has even prompted @entity17 boss @entity16 to hit out at @entity1 's treatment of the striker during the two week international break			1
the former @entity43 youngster has now suffered six separate thigh injuries while at @entity5 adding to his previous hip , hamstring and ankle problems			2
despite playing the full 90 minutes in each of @entity5 's three @entity49 games so far and 89 minutes for @entity1 against @entity50 , @entity3 clearly has to be managed carefully if @entity16 is to get the most from his considerable talents			2
discussing his player 's latest injury , @entity16 said : ' we ’re disappointed because we feel it ’s an injury which could have been prevented ' i think clubs work differently at times to international teams			0
it ’s more the recovery strategy			0
when we look at our players here , we look at them individually in terms of what their needs are			0
