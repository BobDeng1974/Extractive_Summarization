proud : the re-instated display at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , after they were inundated with support in response to a campaign which tried to force them to take the dead animals out of the window what else do you expect at a butchers ? the shop had been displaying half - butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week assistant manager @entity42 said : ' we have had terrific support from almost everyone			1
' businesses have told us we bring shoppers in , so now hopefully we can go back to being traditional butchers			2
' the shop had been displaying half - butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week			0
one writer complaining about the shop window had claimed that the ' needless display of multiple mutilated carcasses ' could frighten children			2
and following a a claim that shoppers would boycott nearby businesses because of the display , its owner @entity57 decided that it would have to go to keep the peace			2

sanitised : the window of @entity11 after they were pressured into taking down the display earlier in the week one shopper said : ' the complaints were just ridiculous - this is a country market town and you would expect a butcher 's shop to display what he was selling			2

' mr @entity42 added : ' we 've had such a positive response from all over the country and the world			0
