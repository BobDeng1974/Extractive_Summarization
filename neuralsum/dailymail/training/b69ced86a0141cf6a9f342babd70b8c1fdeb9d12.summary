by @entity0 this is the moment a @entity3 artist decided to improve his cheap hatchback - by transforming it into a @entity6 made out of cardboard			2
@entity8 turned his pint - sized @entity9 into his own replica of the iconic 1980s sports car as part of his latest art project			1
however , he decided against using metal to recreate the @entity6 's sleek bodywork - instead opting for flattened cardboard boxes			1
the red creation , which fits over the @entity9 like a tea cosy , features black stripes , wing mirrors and a rear spoiler - as well @entity6 's famous logo			1
it is likely to have cost mr @entity8 a lot less to make than its $ 200,000 ( Â£ 126,000 ) real - life version			0
bizarre sight : his completed work is a detailed - albeit , less roadworthy - replica of the @entity24 supercar however , unlike the @entity6 's 4.9 - litre , 390bhp engine - giving it a top speed of 180mph - the imitation motor is capable of just 45mph			1
mr @entity8 , who posted a video of his cardboard creation on @entity43 , has not mentioned if the car is road legal , nor whether it can withstand all weather conditions			0
nonetheless , the unusual contraption has been turning heads in the east - central city of @entity50 in @entity3			0
roadworthy ? mr @entity8 has not mentioned if the car is road legal , nor whether it is waterproof however , not everyone has taken to the bizarre replica - with some @entity43 users commenting on its lack of safety features			2
@entity60 wrote : ' that ca n't be legal , you ca n't see his brake lights ' , while @entity64 deemed it ' unsafe '			0
mr @entity66 , who is known for his wacky artwork , once transformed a police car into a chicken hut .			0
