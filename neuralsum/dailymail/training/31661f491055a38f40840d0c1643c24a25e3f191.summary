' deserted : @entity62 pictured left as he 's escorted into the courtroom at @entity15 in @entity64 , @entity65 on february 9			0
prosecutors argued that he left his troop when he became disillusioned with military life they said he was unhappy with how @entity13 servicemen treated @entity7 during interrogations and that he was upset that training and a second deployment to @entity7 kept him from being with a woman with whom he 'd entered an arranged marriage			1
defense attorneys maintain that @entity0 was kidnapped by insurgents in 2004			1
they argued that the case against the @entity80 serviceman began with a ' rush to judgment ' by @entity83 investigators after suspicious comrades told investigators about comments @entity0 made about the conflict between his native @entity11 and @entity88			1
days after his 2004 disappearance in @entity7 , @entity0 appeared blindfolded and with a sword held above his head in an image purportedly taken by insurgents			1

after his return , @entity0 was allowed to visit family in @entity107 but disappeared a second time in early 2005			2
@entity0 traveled to @entity11 but was detained by that country 's authorities after @entity112 issued a bulletin related to his deserter status , the defense said			0
the defense says court proceedings in @entity11 lasted until 2013 , and @entity0 turned himself in to @entity13 authorities after the government there lifted travel restrictions			0
the defense conceded @entity0 's travel to @entity11 in early 2005 constituted an unauthorized absence , and he has pleaded guilty to that lesser offense			1
prosecutors , however , still pursued the more serious desertion charges .			0
