by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 16:12 est , 29 march 2013 when @entity2 first arrived in @entity3 from @entity4 as a teenager she knew just one word of @entity7 - ' hungry '			1
a strapping six - footer who 'd been obsessed with food from her earliest days ( ' i was a very greedy child ' ) , she was determined to eat well in the @entity3			1
now she has several award - winning cookery books to her name , is about to star in a new @entity17 food show and has plans for her own restaurant chain ; all of which has forced her to reluctantly quit her job as head chef at @entity24 , the smart restaurant adjoining @entity26 in @entity27			1
the night before we meet she had boy band @entity30 in her kitchen after they booked a private dinner there to celebrate @entity35 's birthday			1
' they were tremendously respectful and polite , ' she says			1
' they were so cute and fresh			1
i do hear they like an older woman ! ' @entity2 with @entity41 on @entity42 and that 's @entity2 all over - a fascinating mix of feline - eyed sensuality mixed with tough - as - old - boots attitude			1
when she was once asked how she managed to keep her skin looking so fresh despite long hours in the kitchen she replied , ' i drink young men 's blood ! ' and the word ambitious does n't come close to describing her			1
' you have to have b * * * s to run a kitchen , every day is hard , ' she says			1
' i 'm breaking glass ceilings but i want to do so much more			1
you see @entity59 and @entity60 ? they 're in a different realm to any other chef and i want to be there			1
i want to be the one providing that excitement			1
' she 's aiming high , but if any female chef can take on the big boys the smart money 's on @entity70			1
the daughter of a @entity73 - born journalist and a housewife , @entity2 left communist @entity4 at 16 after falling in love with an @entity7 wine dealer , @entity78 , because ' he did not grab me in the way other boys grabbed me '			1
they married and while @entity2 stayed at home bringing up their first son she taught herself to cook by eating out at nice restaurants with her husband and reading @entity88 's books			1
@entity2 on @entity89 after friends started entering her for competitions she landed a job as chef in the cafe at @entity27 's trendy book shop books for @entity96 , and before long was cooking for private clients including princess @entity98			1
' she was a tough lady but she had a very good palate , ' recalls @entity2			1
it was n't long before tv executives started taking notice of this rather fascinating lady , and she 's been a favourite on @entity107 's @entity106 for six years now			1
' when i first started on that show people would write comments like , “ who 's that slut flirting with @entity112 ? ” but now they know me and come to my restaurant			1
' she 's also a regular on this morning , where @entity116 loves to have a good old flirt with her too - which does n't always go down well with his wife and fellow presenter @entity120			1
' @entity120 and i are friends supposedly but i think she gets very angry , ' admits @entity2			1
' she 'll make remarks like , “ he 's my husband , ” and i 'll say , “ thank you for reminding me			2
” but @entity116 likes it ; he plays up to it and makes it happen			2
i do like @entity116 - he 's very warm			2
but he 's not so hot that @entity120 has to worry			2
' so is there anyone she 's worked alongside who she did n't flirt with ? ' @entity132 , ' she says			2
' he 's like a ginger garden gnome			2
' write caption here @entity2 and her husband have been married for 27 years ( @entity2 wo n't actually give her age , but she 's somewhere in her mid- 40s ) , and it 's probably a good job he refuses to watch her on tv			2
' he thinks i 'm too much , ' she laughs			2
' even when i 'm just sitting down i 'm too much for him			2
he gets very nervous about watching me on tv but he would n't mind me flirting - he knows i 'm a very passionate person and that i love him more now than when we first met			2
' @entity2 at the 2012 @entity143 in @entity27 last november she also adores her two boys , who are now 24 and 18			2
only once during our two - hour conversation does @entity2 pause for more than a second			2
it 's when i ask her about being a working mother in what is a notoriously difficult profession for women			0
' yes , i feel guilty , ' she says quietly			0
' even now i do			0
but i 'm lucky i had my children when i was young			0
' she does n't like to be called a feminist but admits she had this lovely idea of having an all - female kitchen when she opened @entity24			0
' but i could n't find strong enough women to work in my kitchen , ' she says			0
' i tried , i really tried			0
but it was impossible because most of them were weak and pathetic [ she spits out the words ]			0
they 're too worried about their love affairs and their insecurities			0
they were physically weak too - the majority of women are their own worst enemies			0
' her new programme , @entity176 's @entity175 , pits top chefs against the public as they vie to win prizes at local cooking competitions			0
when we meet she 's just returned from a jaunt to the @entity183 where she was paired with @entity41 to cook traditional cakes			0
she wo n't say which of them won ; but she has a glint in her eye			0
' we go to some of the most beautiful parts of @entity3 in a 1950s camper van with a little kitchen at the back			1
i crashed the van a couple of times but it was hilarious			0
the people we met were charming but they looked at me like i was some furry blonde exotic creature and i 'm not sure they could understand my accent			0
@entity41 's great fun but we were very competitive			0
' after seeing her steal the show from @entity41 , the @entity17 are already talking to her about a new project			1
' i ca n't say anything but it will be mind - blowing , ' she squeals			0
and if that 's not enough , she 's in talks to judge a new restaurant show in @entity214			1
somehow she has to fit in what she hopes will be a chain across the @entity217 after being approached by investors			0
@entity2 is living her dream and she really could n't be happier			0
' i feel very lucky to be where i am , ' she says			0
' i have this theory ; people talk about how we all need to embrace life , how we need to love life			0
i also think it 's important that life loves you back			0
and i really feel that my life loves me back			0
it 's fantastic ! ' @entity229 , monday , 1.05pm , tuesday - friday , 2.45pm , @entity176			0
