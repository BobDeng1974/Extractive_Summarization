by @entity0 published : 20:23 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 20:24 est , 11 february 2013 heath secretary @entity1 addressing the @entity2 where he announced that that elderly care bills are to be capped at £ 75,000 more than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state assistance with their long - term care every year thanks to the government ’s decision to ignore the findings of an independent commission , a think - tank said yesterday			1
health secretary @entity1 confirmed he will set a cap of £ 75,000 on the amount people have to contribute to their personal care needs , with the @entity16 paying the rest			1
but this is far higher than the £ 35,000 cap recommended two years ago by a commission headed by economist @entity21 , who yesterday expressed ‘ regret ’ the cap had been set so high			1
@entity24 said the £ 75,000 cap would help no more than one in six pensioners over their lifetime , while a £ 35,000 cap would have helped one in three			1
the higher cap means more than 120,000 pensioners will miss out on state help each year			0
@entity31 , deputy director of @entity24 , said : ‘ for the @entity32 to consider putting the cap at £ 75,000 is unambitious , miserly , and will do little to solve one of the most vital social problems facing our generation			1
‘ a cap of £ 75,000 means that the majority of people will still be paying just as much on their social care as they would have before the cap			1
’ mr @entity21 told the @entity44 ’s @entity43 that it was a shame the cap had been set so high , but insisted it would mean that pensioners no longer had to be ‘ terrified ’ of the consequences of needing care			0
‘ we said it should be between £ 25,000 and £ 50,000 in 2010/11 prices , ’ he said			0
‘ the cap that is being proposed is £ 75,000 , we think in 2017 prices			2
that ’s the equivalent of £ 61,000 in our terms , so it is higher than we would have wanted			0
‘ i regret that but i recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state			0
’ how the new system will work @entity61 from charity @entity62 said : ‘ the government has taken a brave step towards bringing older people and their families peace of mind in contemplating future care costs			0
while the £ 75,000 level will temper rather than dispel anxiety for most around care costs , it is an important principle that no - one should be left to face spiralling care needs alone			2
’ mr @entity1 told @entity74 that the cap would protect families from the ‘ limitless and often ruinous cost ’ of care			2
@entity80 ’s health spokesman @entity79 said : ‘ this is a step forward , but it is a faltering one			0
