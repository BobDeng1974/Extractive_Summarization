these massive walls of fat , sewage and wet wipes have been discovered in a network of sewers			1
in the last six months @entity6 has found more than 6,000 tonnes of ‘ fatbergs ’ , which clog up pipes when people flush items down their toilets or pour fat down the sink			1
these materials - weighing , in this case , the same as 2,000 fully grown hippos - do not break down and cause blockages in the pipes			2
according the @entity6 , @entity33 is the worst place in the @entity35 to find blockages , with 2,155 tonnes of fatbergs cleared from the county ’s sewers			1
and almost 2,000 tonnes of unflushable material was found below @entity41			2
@entity6 said it costs millions of pounds each year to clear the fatbergs , which is passed on through water bills			1
a spokesman for the firm said : ' people think that because it is out of sight out of mind they do not have to worry about it			0
but it is still there , lurking in the pipes and can come back into their homes			1
’ unpleasant : @entity56 pumping station in @entity57 , @entity41 - a county where almost 2,000 tonnes of unflushable material was found underground the company added that one of the biggest problems it faces is wet wipes that claim to be safe to flush , but do not degrade like toilet paper			1
@entity66 , @entity6 ’s waste water strategy manager said : ‘ the use of wet wipes and things like make - up wipes , moist toilet tissue and cleaning wipes apparently rises by 15 per cent each year - but this trend is putting a strain on our sewers			1
‘ unlike toilet roll these wipes do n’t break down when flushed , so frequently cause blockages			1
they can get tangled up in the pumps and filters			0
even those said to be flushable cause problems			2
‘ they do n’t biodegrade so can still lock pipes further down the line			2
@entity88 them causes a pain in the drain , which is why we urge people to only flush the three ps - pee , poo and paper			0

apart from wet wipes , cooking fat is said to cause huge problems for sewers - as it settles in the pipes it becomes hard like concrete apart from wet wipes , cooking fat is said to cause huge problems for sewers			1
as it settles in the pipes it becomes hard like concrete and will not let waste water pass through the pipes			2
these blockages have to be cleared by hand using large rods or high powered water jets to dislodge the walls of blocked waste			0
@entity122 councillor @entity121 - in charge of economy , transport and environment in the region - said he was not surprised at the vast amount of fatbergs found in the sewers			0
‘ people do n’t seem to take a great deal of care about what they flush down the toilets , ’ he said			0
‘ no product other than toilet tissue should be put down the toilet			0
at these sewage pumping stations the blockage can be literally explosive			0
’ the average weight of a hippo is 6,500lbs ( three tonnes ) , according to @entity144 .			0

@entity6 finds more than 6,000 tonnes of ' fatbergs ' in six months
fat being poured down sink congeals *&* grows *inside* underground pipes
problems caused when this is *joined* by wet wipes flushed down toilets
pressure builds in pipes and causes sewage to explode back into homes
