@entity0 reviews the best buys , the big surprises , the players who got away and the lucky ones who survived the january clear - out during a busy transfer window			2
deal of the month for all the big money transfers , the one that gave many a young player hope was that of @entity13			2
a 20 - year - old right - back who had failed to get a break at @entity17 , fell out of love with the game then tried his luck playing for @entity21			1
pushed to go for a trial at @entity23 , within two weeks he had signed a contract			1
as he said , dreams can come true			0
@entity29 's signing of @entity30 from @entity31 should prove astute business for @entity33 window 's star buy @entity36 could make all the difference to @entity17 's attack			1
his power and physical presence aligned with compatriot @entity41 will give @entity17 a fighting chance of muscling their way back to the top of the @entity46			1
however , @entity29 's signing of @entity30 should prove astute business			1
yes , he 's not cheap but he can make @entity29 stronger , has versatility and flair to make an immediate impact and will prove a telling addition to an already impressive squad			1
@entity53 ( right ) chats to @entity55 assistant coach @entity54 during training on tuesday bargain of the window @entity55 signing @entity53 on loan could prove a masterstroke if they can revive his form of old			1
@entity64 would n't have let him go if they felt he could still make a significant contribution and his workrate and final ball have been questioned too often recently			2
@entity68 likes a winger and a @entity71 derby for a debut could be the perfect platform or where the truth hurts			0
other good business has to be @entity78 's signing of @entity79 on a free and @entity80 bringing in the experience and slightly - creaking back of @entity82 to steady their nervous defence			1
@entity78 securing @entity79 on a free was a shrewd piece of business from the club surprise of the window @entity90 signing for @entity91 answered what many thought would never happen			1
could he really leave @entity94 ? yep			0
@entity96 paying so much for @entity97 was excellent business for @entity29 and @entity100 tempting @entity99 to the @entity101 was a real coup , albeit expensive			1
however , @entity104 's last - minute move from @entity105 to @entity23 brought out the romantic side in all of us , even if he does only play for their @entity108			1
@entity90 ( right ) tries to close down @entity110 during @entity94 training at @entity112 on tuesday one that got away there was so many on the final day			0
one agent had 14 potential deals on friday and ended up with none come 11pm monday			0
one @entity46 target was sold at 1pm , his agent asked for more money at 8pm and the player turned up for his medical at 10.35pm			0
yes , it fell through			0
however , the one you have to feel for is @entity127			0
so close to signing at @entity78 after playing a bit part at @entity129 , through no fault of his own he was recalled as @entity129 failed to find a striker and @entity133 botched their bid to send back @entity135			1
@entity127 ( right ) replaces @entity136 during @entity129 's 2 - 0 defeat against @entity94 on saturday are you still here ? @entity138 continues to linger with little intent at @entity140 despite their best attempts to shift him but special prize for resilience has to go to @entity145			2
rarely a week goes by without a question to @entity147 on his role and future			0
@entity145 's colourful agent @entity151 struck fear into all at @entity153 saying : ' @entity145 is very disappointed with himself , he 's going through a bad time like he 's never had before			2
but the plan is for him to continue at @entity153			0
i saw him on monday and told him : '' you have a four - year contract and i will not send you away			0
you only leave @entity94 at Â£ 45m , and i win my bet , or you will die there ''			0
@entity145 ( right ) has had a tough start to his career at @entity94 but was not moved on in january			2

@entity36 could make all the difference to @entity17 's attack
@entity30 should prove astute business for @entity29
