by @entity0 it 's the hairstyle that was once reserved for punks and male models but with a little help from the glossiest and most fashion - forward a-listers , the undercut is fast becoming the hairstyle du jour			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who are known for their experimental styles , were the first celebrities to rock the shaved hairstyle and now even play - it - safe @entity13 and @entity14 are showcasing what at last looks like newly - shorn hair			1
last week 's @entity18 , a comic convention held annually in @entity20 , was case in point			1
co-stars @entity13 and @entity24 wore matchy - matchy undercuts for the @entity27 panel and @entity28 loved the look so much , she wore it for three days in a row			1
the likes of @entity50 and @entity51 have embraced a more pared - back and elegant take on the style and the usually grungy @entity55 even wore the look in her @entity58 campaign			1
but this is n't the first time we 've seen the look			1
in fact , it 's a catwalk style that was trialled at @entity65 in february that has since filtered down to the red - carpet slowly but surely ever since			1
the rebellious style , which is expected to play an even bigger part in @entity69 in september , was spotted at shows by @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 ; the @entity75 beauty team have even featured a how - to in their latest issue			2
she just ca n't get enough ! @entity78 star @entity28 seemingly loves the new style - she 's been seen sporting it at every event this fortnight long - standing fan : trendy @entity7 , who loves to experiment with her style , was seen wearing cornrows at last year 's @entity86 ball , left , as well as at the @entity87 this year , right fake it : if you do n't want to literally shave your hair off on one side , create the illusion by braiding it into cornrows a la @entity51 , left , and @entity50 but how do you take a tricky catwalk trend and pull the look off at home ? @entity98 , @entity99 at @entity100 , said : ' when deciding between the undercut or the faux undercut , you need to consider your lifestyle and if it ’s something you need to hide for work			1
if so , the faux option is the best choice			2
' you can only hide a real undercut if you have long thick hair			2
if you have a low parting , opt for that side			2
if you have a centre parting , you can use whichever side you feel most comfortable with			2
' if you are going to be bold and pick the real option , you have to go really , really short - you definitely do n’t want to have any fuzz ! you need to have it re-shaved regularly			2
your stylist will be able to help you with placement as the distance that you go back will depend on your crown			0
' if plaiting instead , decide on the number of plaits you need			0
they need to look neat to get the best results so you may need to ask a friend or professional for help			0
if you are doing yourself - you will get the tidiest results with an inverted @entity128 plait			0
famous fans : @entity133 rocks an undercut on her album cover , left , while @entity136 trials the trend with cornrows ' start by using a hair oil to tame any flyaways - @entity140 is perfect for this			1
undercuts work best on short , messy looks - for example @entity8 , or long textured styles like @entity145			0
' it does n’t work so well on mid-length or fine hair , and you need to style the hair that you leave loose with texture or movement			0
' @entity152 date back to the @entity153 and were used to portray status , age , religion and ethnicity			0
fast forward to the @entity159 and plaits were used as a political statement with many @entity162 embracing their cultural roots , and now , it seems , they 're a serious style statement			0
according to style and brand expert @entity167 , the cornrow is here to stay - and it 's all @entity7 's fault			0
he said : ' @entity152 are a big trend right now that ’s polarising the fashion elite ! the @entity171 will encourage festival goers and @entity174 trendies to embrace the trend in different ways but it will be particularly interesting to see how it trickles down to the high street			1
' i think we ’ll see people trying both loose and tight styles , what will make this interesting will be seeing if they can rock it like @entity7			0
' @entity184 , director of @entity185 , shares a foolproof guide to getting the look .			0
