sentence : @entity32 , pictured , could face life in jail when he is sentenced on december 6 judge @entity40 , when ruling that the anonymity order should be lifted , said : ' the principle of open justice is immutable and must only be restricted where either the administration of justice would be seriously affected without the grant of an order for anonymity or there would be a real and immediate risk to the personnel were anonymity not granted			1
' this is not a case relating to the administration of justice and i am not satisfied that those who seek a continuance of the anonymity order have demonstrated that the fear that the marines ' lives will be at risk is objectively well - founded			2
' counsel for the marines said they wished to appeal and the judge said the anonymity order would remain in force pending further determination by the @entity51			2
@entity32 , 39 , could face life in prison when he is sentenced on december 6			1

not punishing him would severely ' erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies ' , @entity109 said			0
‘ it would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading , some sort of exemption			0
' lord @entity118 , a former @entity119 , agreed and said : ‘ the military should observe the highest standards , and if some crime is committed , like everybody else they should pay the price			0
