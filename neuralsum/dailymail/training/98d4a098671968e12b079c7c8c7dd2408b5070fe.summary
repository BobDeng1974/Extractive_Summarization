by @entity0 campaign donation : @entity2 with his wife @entity3 @entity4 speaker @entity2 has been criticised for accepting a £ 2,500 donation from @entity7 ’s disgraced former fundraiser , @entity8			1
news of the @entity12 peer ’s gift , which will go towards funding his 2015 general election campaign , was met with disbelief last night – with one @entity17 mp calling it ‘ misguided and inadvisable ’			1
mr @entity2 accepted the four - figure sum last month			2
his decision to accept the donation is regarded as unorthodox , principally because he sat as a @entity17 mp between 1997 and 2009 when he was elected speaker			1
as speaker , he is not supposed to be affiliated to any political party			2
but one @entity17 mp , speaking on condition of anonymity , said : ‘ for @entity2 to be taking money from a @entity12 peer so closely associated with @entity7 yet again raises the spectre of an @entity32 bias in him			1
this is misguided and inadvisable			0
’ the donation has also raised eyebrows at @entity35 because of @entity8 ’s chequered financial career			0
the multi-millionaire met @entity7 , the then shadow home secretary , at a dinner at the @entity40 embassy in 1994			0
the two soon became close friends and tennis partners , and mr @entity7 decided to make him a life peer after @entity12 ’s election victory in 1997			1
in 2000 @entity8 hit the headlines after it was revealed he had only paid £ 5,000 in tax during the financial year 1998 - 99 , although he strenuously denied engaging in tax avoidance			1
@entity8 , left , was a close friend and advisor of @entity7 , right , during his time in @entity51 and then as pm and in his 13 years as chief @entity12 fundraiser , during which he was nicknamed ‘ @entity8 ’ , @entity8 was at the centre of the ‘ cash for honours scandal ’ and he ended up being arrested on two occasions			1
it was alleged that he helped to secure a series of six - figure loans from businessmen in exchange for offering them a seat in the @entity66			0
the @entity67 dropped the case in 2007 after a 16 - month criminal investigation , claiming that it could find no direct evidence of any such agreements being made in advance of the loans			0
however @entity8 emerged from the affair with his personal reputation badly bruised			2
at one stage the scandal even appeared to risk unseating mr @entity7			0
the 69 - year - old peer , who raised an estimated £ 100million for @entity12 , was one of mr @entity7 ’s closest confidants during his decade in @entity82			1
he stepped down from the fundraising post in 2007 , when mr @entity7 quit @entity85 politics , and relinquished his role as his @entity88 envoy at the same time			2
his donation was disclosed in the latest register of mps ’ financial interests , where it is classed as a ‘ sponsorship ’			0
mr @entity2 , the mp for @entity95 , has stipulated that he accepted the money as a ‘ donation to my campaign for re-election to the @entity4 ’			2
previously the fact that the pair knew each other was not common knowledge			0
however a source close to the speaker said that he and @entity8 had struck up a friendship three years ago			2
they both share a love for tennis and are active charity fundraisers			0
lord @entity8 originally qualified as an accountant before making a multi-million pound fortune in the music industry			1
he founded @entity114 , which was sold to @entity115 in the late 1980s , and whose artists included @entity117 and @entity118			0
he is now the chairman of @entity119			0
in the register , mr @entity2 also revealed that he accepted a £ 5,000 gift from @entity122 , a friend of 30 years ’ standing			1
a spokesman for mr @entity2 said : ‘ the speaker has been friends with @entity8 for three years			1
they have undertaken various charity projects together			0

@entity2 *'s* decision has been branded ' misguided and inadvisable '
as speaker , @entity2 is meant to be *neutral* between political parties
however , he sat as a @entity17 mp between 1997 and 2009 before taking post
lord @entity8 was a close ally of @entity7 and a fundraiser for @entity12
he made headlines in 2000 when it emerged he only only £ 5,000 tax in ' 98/9
