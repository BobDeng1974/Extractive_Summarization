for the 0.01 per cent , booking holiday travel is a far different experience than it is for the rest of us			1
instead of scrolling through holiday deals on bargain - finding websites , these ultra-wealthy individuals prefer to take off on a moment 's notice and sort out any over-the - top accommodations and activities upon arrival			1
to get a glimpse inside this elite - and rarely planned - world , @entity14 spoke to wedding and event planner @entity17 , who has helped organise ceremonies and honeymoons for everyone from celebrities to @entity23 businessmen			1

watch the @entity205 from the comfort of a private luxury yacht @entity208 - from £ 3,000 depending on the yacht position ( flights not included ) the @entity212 grand prix is synonymous with style and glamour but why not up the ante even furhter and watch it on board your very own private yacht ? you 'll be treated to full hospitality during the qualifying rounds on saturday and race day on the sunday , including breakfast , lunch and canapés , as well as @entity225 all day			0
take part in a rickshaw race across @entity228 @entity229 - from around £ 15,000 driving in @entity228 can be a hair - raising experience , but driving a rickshaw must surely be up there with nail - biting rides ? @entity229 's trip to take part in a rickshaw race will take in the sights , sounds , smell and traffic in this incredible country			0

' once , somebody was on a post-wedding shoot and they wanted a white horse at sunset , ' she remembers			0
