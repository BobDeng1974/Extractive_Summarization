by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s remedy for @entity6 ’s @entity5 hangover is to stop trying to mimic their more successful @entity8 rivals and focus on producing football branded with their own national identity			1
after signing former @entity6 captain @entity15 , the @entity14 manager claimed there are plenty of quality players and wants to see @entity19 forge them into a team based on attacking flair with the confidence to play out of defence			1
he said : ' i thought @entity6 were certainties to win what in my opinion was a very poor group			1
@entity30 winning the group tells you everything really			0
do n’t ask me what happens			0
we ’ve had lots of good players and managers since 1966			0
but we are going to win the @entity5 in @entity50 so they say , in 40 degree heat			2
' here was a swipe at @entity54 chairman @entity53 who launched a nine - year plan last year to win the title by 2022 and the @entity14 boss , overlooked when @entity19 took the job two years ago , clearly has little faith in the @entity54 to stop the slump			1
' @entity62 won because @entity62 produce good players			0
' @entity65 win the @entity5 and we have to copy the @entity67			2
then it ’s @entity69 , so we have to copy @entity69			0
quality : @entity3 says @entity6 must start playing from the back , just like he told @entity15 to do as a youngster @entity73 completes @entity14 move backing : despite @entity6 's latest setback @entity3 still believes @entity19 is a good manager ' let ’s be ourselves			1
let ’s get the best players and decide what is @entity6 ’s style of play and everyone should play the same way , down through the youth teams and employ people to work with the kids who want to play that way			1
' play from the back , like i said to @entity15 when he was 16 : ‘ come out with the ball , i do n’t want to see you booting the ball up the pitch			0
you play and if you lose the ball i will take the blame because i ’m telling you to play that way			0
' we have to do that with @entity6 and produce teams who play from the back			2
but the people involved in the younger @entity6 teams , are they people who want to play that way ? i do n’t know			2

the @entity14 boss believes @entity6 need to concentrate on developing their own national identity instead of copying other nations
@entity3 was *shocked* after @entity6 finished bottom of their @entity5 group
he also *questions* if the right people are in charge of the youth set - up in the national team
