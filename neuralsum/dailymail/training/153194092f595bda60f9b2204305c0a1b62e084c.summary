if there is anywhere in @entity3 football where faith alone can move mountains it 's at @entity6			2
and when @entity8 take on their city neighbours in the last 16 of the @entity10 they will face a club riding a wave of @entity14 euphoria , convinced he can roll back the years on a dramatic home debut			1
they know deep down that four years have passed since @entity14 was at anywhere near his best and in the long run he is likely to be the club 's first reserve behind @entity22			2
but with the @entity25 striker rested and the 30 - year @entity3 international they are still calling ' @entity27 ' not looking all that different to the boy wonder that left them in 2007 , they are backing him to help them roll over @entity8 for a third time this season			1
@entity14 will make his second debut for @entity6 against @entity8 in the @entity10 @entity14 trains with his new team - mates and will hope to make an impression during his second spell @entity14 was unveiled in front of 45,000 fans at the @entity40 stadium in @entity6 at the weekend @entity14 has returned to the club following a disappointing spell in @entity43 with @entity44 @entity6 : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity14 , @entity54 @entity8 : @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ; @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 @entity6 have already beaten @entity8 in the @entity66 and in the league and @entity68 has thrust @entity14 straight into his starting line - up knowing that leaving him on the bench might have broken the momentum built up around his arrival			1
' if he did n't think he was ready i would n't put him in , ' he said , suggesting that @entity14 will give @entity6 back the option of that long pass over the top of a defence that they have lost since the departure of @entity80			1
@entity14 spent seven years with @entity6 before leaving to join @entity81 in the @entity82 in 2007 @entity14 scored 91 goals for the club and became a fans ' favourite before leaving for @entity87 @entity14 struggled to make an impression at @entity44 after joining them on loan from @entity91 @entity14 does have 10 @entity43 games under his belt this season but he only scored once for @entity44 and they were as happy to let him leave as @entity91 were			1
none of that is bothering @entity68 who has seen how his arrival has lifted everyone at the club			0
over 2,000 @entity102 replica shirts were sold on sunday when 45,000 people packed into the @entity40 to see him run back out on to the pitch where he made his debut while @entity68 was still an @entity6 player			1
the @entity107 coach said : ' i have good memories of him			0
when we were both players we got on very well			0
so much happened to him at a very young age , now he is 30 but he still has the desire and the enthusiasm			0
' those at the club slightly distanced from the euphoria see @entity14 serving an important purpose even if he does n't hit the highs of his first period at the @entity40			2
in last season 's @entity121 final against @entity8 , @entity6 played an unfit @entity80 and paid the price when he hobbled off no sooner had the game started			1
@entity65 will feature against @entity6 as the city rivals bid to progress in the @entity10 @entity63 will also feature as @entity8 look to bounce back from their defeat by @entity128 that left them a substitute short in extra-time when they ran out of energy and were well beaten by @entity8			1
@entity14 gives them experience and goals â€“ although he has only ever scored twice against the old enemy and one of those goals came when he was at @entity81			1
@entity8 coach @entity140 has only got the better of @entity68 three times in eight meetings since arriving in @entity3 and will stick with his tried and trusted @entity144 front three of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , despite criticism of @entity63 after sunday 's defeat to @entity128 when he failed to play in a team - mate and ended up missing the perfect chance to score			2
@entity60 looks set to be drafted into midfield to strengthen a side that broke a run of 22 straight wins with that reverse at @entity154			0
there is no @entity156 so @entity57 and @entity58 will be waiting for @entity14			2
@entity6 's prodigal son is back			0
the club 's famed fitness coach @entity158 has not had long to work with @entity160 but has already drilled him on the runs his team - mates will be expecting from him tonight			0
@entity163 is to test the nostalgia against the reality			0
' he has not come as the saviour , ' said @entity68 when he signed			0
that maybe true in the long run but tonight , @entity6 expects .			0
