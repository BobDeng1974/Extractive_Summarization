the president attended a fundraiser hosted by @entity17 and @entity18 at the hip - hop mogul 's @entity19 in @entity21 where guests paid $ 40,000 a head			1

@entity3 @entity2 - otherwise known as @entity2 - is part of duo @entity45 along with @entity46 who lined up tunes for the glittering @entity32 bash on tuesday evening			1
@entity2 told @entity10 : ' i think it sends an important message for @entity18 and @entity17 to throw this fundraiser ... that it 's important for people that support the president to actually support the president			1
' he admitted that not everyone can afford to throw a multimillion - dollar fundraiser like @entity7 's a-list friends , but added : ' everybody can do something , whether it 's make some phone calls , knock on doors , have a little party of your own , throw a club , whatever it is you can do in whatever town that you 're in , you should be doing that if you actually do support the president and you want him to be re-elected '			1
campaign spin : @entity3 @entity2 , in action on the decks , is a firm believer in @entity7 's message friends in high places : president @entity7 chats up @entity17 and @entity18 at the $ 105,000 @entity32 champagne fundraiser the couple threw for him on tuesday night at the @entity19 , the singer @entity17 introduced @entity7 and said that she and her husband @entity18 ' believe in his vision '			1
@entity7 said : ' let me just begin by saying to @entity18 and @entity17 , thank you so much for your friendship			1
@entity87 and @entity88 and @entity89 are mad at me because they are not here			2
' that does n’t usually happen			2
usually they ’re like , we ’re glad you ’re going – we do n’t need to go			0
but every time they get a chance to see these two they are thrilled , partly because they are just both so generous , particularly to my kids			0
and @entity88 and @entity89 just love both of them			0
' @entity7 added that @entity17 ' could n’t be a better role model for our daughters because she carries herself with such class and poise '			2
$ 105,000 : the champagne tower at the @entity109 that costs twice the average income of a @entity112 family classy : @entity7 told the guests , including @entity115 , seen arriving for the event ( right ) , that he could n't think of a better role model for his girls than @entity17 , because of her ' poise ' ( pictured with @entity18 last month ) @entity19 : @entity7 also compared himself to @entity18 at the event , saying he knows'what my life is like			1
we both have daughters , and our wives are more popular than we are			0
' he then compared himself to @entity18 ' @entity18 now knows what my life is like			0
we both have daughters , and our wives are more popular than we are			0
so we ’ve got a little bond there			0
it ’s hard , but it ’s okay			0
' like him , @entity17 and @entity18 came from humble backgrounds , he said			0
' and the good thing about so many of us here – and i know , i speak for @entity18 and @entity17 – is we remember what it ’s like not having anything , and we know people who were just as talented as us that did n’t get the same break , the same chance			0
' we remember some of our parents or grandparents who came here as immigrants and got a little bit of help along the way to go to that school or be able to start that first business			0
' celebrity circles : the president also appeared on @entity156 last night where he said he stands up for ' all @entity112 ' following the 47 % furor over @entity160 's secret tapes both @entity7 and his opponent @entity160 are frantically holding fundraisers even in the final stretch of the campaign to raise to avoid being swamped by attacks ads. and it was at a $ 50,000 - a - head fundraiser in @entity168 , @entity169 some months ago that @entity160 made his controversial comments about his job being to not worry about the 47 per cent of @entity112 who do not pay income tax			1
@entity7 accused @entity160 of ' writing off big chunks of the country ' and rebuked his rival 's claims that nearly half of all @entity112 believe they are ' victims ' entitled to sponge off the government .			2

@entity3 @entity2 appealed to voters to ' throw a club ' after @entity185 couple hold $ 40,000 - a - head fundraiser for @entity7 at 40/40 club in @entity21
