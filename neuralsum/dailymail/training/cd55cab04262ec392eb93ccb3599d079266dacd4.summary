by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 3 june 2012 updated : 10:56 est , 3 june 2012 when @entity2 the corn snake disappeared without a trace last year devastated 10 - year - old @entity4 frantically tried to hunt down his beloved foot long pet			1
having finally given up hope of finding the reptile though the youngster and his family moved home shortly afterwards , making way for new homeowners			0
but as the somewhat startled new family stumbled across it in the garage one year on it was not so hard to spot - as it had grown to a whopping four foot			1
slithering surprise : @entity4 has been reunited with his beloved snake @entity2 after new householders discovered the reptile lurking in his old home in @entity24 @entity4 ’s dad , @entity25 , a 44 - year - old firefighter , got a call from the shocked new owners of his home last week			1
he said : ' @entity4 was heartbroken when he lost him and it was horrible at the time			2
' he was upset for weeks and people kept saying he might turn up , but he never did and we subsequently moved house			0
' but i had a call from the owners of our old house saying they had found him in the garage - not surprisingly they were a little alarmed			2
' two - year - old @entity2 was just over a foot - long when he disappeared from the home in @entity41 , @entity24 , and it is thought the thin snake hunted mice to survive over the course of the year and hid in small crevices , unnoticed			1
but when the new homeowners @entity48 and @entity49 found him hiding in the garage last week he was substantially bigger			2
@entity49 said : ' i got a phone call from my husband to say ‘ we have a problem ’ and he told me he ’d found a snake in the garage			1
corn snakes like this one can grow to around six foot in length and are usually found in @entity59 ' he was all right about it actually and i think i was more shocked than him			1
' he got it wrapped round a stick and put it in a bucket			0
' @entity4 has since paid a visit to @entity48 and @entity49 to thank them for reuniting him with @entity2 and he gave them a card , a bottle of wine and some sweets for the couple ’s two - year - old son @entity74			2
@entity4 said : ' i was absolutely shocked that we had found him because he had been gone for so long			0
' i was really devastated that i lost him and i ’m not going to let him go missing again			0
' @entity4 , who lives with parents @entity25 and @entity78 , siblings @entity79 , 11 , and seven - year - old twins @entity80 and @entity81 , is now enjoying introducing @entity2 to his other snake , @entity84 , which he bought after @entity2 ’s disappearance			1
@entity86 , part - owner of @entity87 in nearby @entity88 , where @entity4 bought his pet , said corn snakes were placid creatures and not to be feared			0
he said : ' corn snakes are an @entity93 species and with living in a house it ’s probably a similar climate to what they would get in @entity59			0
they would n’t survive outside in this country			0
' because they are so thin , they are able to get through a lot of small holes and crevices and you would be quite surprised what food they would be able to find around the house			0
' when corn snakes are young they feed on pinkie mice but as they get bigger they start on larger mice so it ’s safe to say @entity2 was probably doing a bit of pest control while he was missing			1
