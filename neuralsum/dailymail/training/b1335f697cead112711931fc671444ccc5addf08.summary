@entity0 has warned his @entity2 players they could be substituted early if they fail to handle what promises to be a poisonous atmosphere inside @entity5			1
the @entity2 boss is bracing himself for a mass supporter protest against his management of the team			1
one group – @entity11 – have printed 35,000 @entity13 cards calling for him to be sacked			1
@entity0 is concerned that such a toxic atmosphere will spread to the pitch			1
@entity2 protest group ' @entity17 ' have parodied owner @entity20 's @entity19 logo @entity0 has vowed to hook any @entity2 players who struggle with the @entity5 atmosphere and , to that end , he admits he could be forced to withdraw players affected by unrest in the stands			1
‘ i would not say this is a normal negative game			2
i think it is a little more than that , ’ said @entity0 ahead of the visit of @entity28			1
‘ i have tried to express to the players that this is a place where emotions run high			2
‘ it ’s an emotional crowd which relays itself on to the pitch			2
the players are going to have to deal with it			2
‘ i do n’t really know the answer to what they are going to be like			2
i will look for players who i think are struggling with the situation , more so to protect them			2
it may well be that at half - time , i make an early change			1
‘ it might be that the situation has got too much for that individual player , not because he is necessarily playing poorly			0
’ @entity2 are bottom of the @entity53 heading in to the game and owner @entity20 has given @entity0 no guarantees over his future , although @entity58 understands his job is safe in the short term at least			1
@entity61 could be in the line to play some part as the @entity65 host @entity28 on saturday @entity67 midfielder @entity66 takes a free kick during a training session on friday it was during the final home game of last season – a 3 - 0 win over @entity74 – that fans hissed their disapproval every time @entity0 ventured in to his technical area			1
and he said : ‘ that was the first time i have ever experienced that			0
as a manager , you have to use your knowledge and resolve to deal with certain situations			1
‘ i had some really testing times last season , as we know			0
‘ but it can also make you stronger - it can make the players stronger too			2
we have talked about the @entity74 game and coming through that			0
we knew before that game how much pressure there would be			0
’ @entity0 , though , is in bullish mood ahead of the game and even found time to share a joke before outlining his determination to stay in the job			1
‘ of course ( i ’m bracing myself )			0
you do n’t expect me to wave to the crowd and say , “ hi everyone , i ’m happy , how are you today ? ”			0
that ’s not happening , ’ he went on			0
@entity0 had this pair of official club pictures taken of him during a photocall earlier in the week ‘ i ’m not nervous at the moment and i ’m not in fear of it either			1
that ’s not an ego or an arrogance thing , that ’s just the way i am wired			0
‘ i kind of want the game now , i want to play it			0
i want to get it done and i want to get a win			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 will come face to face with @entity119 for the first time since headbutting the @entity28 midfielder in march			1
his actions cost him a £ 100,000 club fine , £ 60,000 @entity124 fine and a seven - game touchline ban , which included three matches excluded from the stadium			2
but @entity0 said : ‘ obviously i have had to change			1
it is an incident i apologised for and regretted			0
‘ i have not seen him since			0
i will shake his hand and i am sure he will smile at me			0
it is something i ’d like to think that i have learnt from			0
