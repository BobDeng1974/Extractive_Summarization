@entity0 smiled and laughed with his attorneys in court this afternoon just feet away from the crying mother of the victim as a judge ruled the trial will ignore bullets found in his apartment			1
the former @entity9 has denied shooting to death semi-professional football player @entity11 , who was dating the sister of his fiancee			2
and today his defense team was awarded a small success as a judge agreed to ignore the bullets found in @entity0 's rented apartment , which police claimed was the same caliber as the gun that killed @entity11 , because they had not provided a reason for a search warrant			1
waiting for the news , the 24 - year - old did not seem worried as his team persisted with their arguments , and mr @entity11 's mother , @entity28 , sat in the public gallery weeping			0
relaxed : @entity0 smiled on the third day of his evidentiary hearing at @entity31 yesterday , @entity0 's defense appeared to take a blow after they claimed he was forcibly searched by police - but footage shown at @entity31 showed the former football player relaxing on his couch			1
the defense said the search amounted to unlawful questioning , and today a judge agreed that the police failed to provide a probable reason for the warrant			1
they maintain he was n't free to leave			0
he has said he felt ' helpless ' and worried about his family			0
@entity0 had earlier referred questions to his attorney			0
a trooper testified on wednesday that @entity0 did n't seem frightened or raise concerns during the searches and said he could have left			0
upset : she clutched her face as the judge decided bullets and a magazine found by police would be ignored @entity0 's defense argued he was unlawfully questioned when police searched an apartment he was renting still smiling : his defense took a blow yesterday but the football player seemed laid back as his team spoke some testimony today focused on whether @entity0 was asked where his phone was			1
now , @entity0 's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court			2
a cell phone turned over by @entity0 that shows he had been in contact with @entity11 , and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died , was obtained by the prosecution under a ' false claim of legal authority ' the defense is arguing			2
prosecutors have alleged that @entity0 and @entity11 exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that @entity0 and two accomplices picked up @entity11 in @entity85 before driving him to @entity86 and killing him			1
according to @entity88 , the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone			0
pleaded : he has pleaded not guilty to first - degree murder and is calling on prosecutors to scrap some evidence claims : the 24 - year - old insists he was left ' helpless ' and worried when police searched his home but yesterday prosecution released a video of the football player relaxed on his couch as police searched changes ? his team want the trial moved out of @entity85 , where polls show most already think he is guilty judge @entity109 said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence			1
the defense is also asking the judge for a change of venue , hoping to move the trial from @entity116 , @entity117 , to somewhere outside the @entity85 area			2
their reasoning includes a poll finding that most people in @entity31 already think their client is guilty of first - degree murder			0
@entity0 was again in court today and , just like yesterday , seen smiling and laughing			1
he is also facing murder charges in @entity127 for the july 2012 drive - by shootings of two men outside a @entity85 club .			0

former @entity9 laughed and *joked* with legal team in court
today a judge agreed to discount bullets and a magazine police found because they did not provide a probable reason for the warrant
he *stands* accused of murdering @entity11 in 2013 , he pleads not guilty
@entity0 's defense took blow yesterday as prosecutors released video of him relaxing during the ' *unwarranted* ' search that left him ' helpless '
his team wants trial moved out of @entity85 where most think he is guilty
