by @entity0 @entity2 's participation in the @entity4 final is in doubt after it emerged that his crass attempt to put off @entity8 goal - kicker @entity7 in saturday ’s @entity10 semi-final is being investigated by the @entity11			1
with the @entity13 crowd keeping a respectful silence , @entity2 could be clearly heard inside the ground shouting ‘ @entity16 ! ’ as he attempted to charge down @entity7 ’s conversion of @entity19 ’s try on the stroke of half - time			1
his actions sparked a melee in the tunnel as incensed @entity8 players - including @entity2 ’s @entity26 - mates @entity19 , @entity27 and @entity28 - confronted the @entity13 winger to let him know what they thought of his behaviour			1
wrong : @entity2 attempted to putt off @entity8 goal - kicker @entity7 controversial moment : @entity2 's @entity4 final participation is now in doubt referee @entity35 , who had earlier sent two @entity13 players - @entity36 and @entity38 - to the sin bin , chose not to penalise @entity2 despite the angry exchanges which continued down the tunnel			1
the @entity11 decided against citing the player but @entity43 has learned that the @entity11 ’s head of discipline , @entity44 , is investigating the incident and @entity2 could yet face a misconduct charge			2
in the worst - case scenario , he could receive a ban although it is understood a written warning is the most likely sanction			0
whatever the outcome , the incident will not have gone unnoticed by @entity26 head coach @entity54 as he considers his tour party for @entity56			0
@entity2 , who has 37 caps , was left out of @entity26 ’s @entity59 squad but with @entity61 winger @entity60 recently having knee and shoulder surgery , he is in contention for a recall following his exceptional recent form			2
‘ humility and honesty are written up on the walls around the stadium , ’ said an unimpressed @entity8 director of rugby @entity67 after the game			2
‘ it ( @entity2 ’s shout ) was n’t something you ’d expect someone to do but we ’ll leave it			2
’ @entity2 went on to score a try as @entity13 overhauled a 17 - 11 half - time deficit with a commanding second - half display which saw @entity84 ’s men score 20 unanswered points to power their way into a final against @entity88 and give themselves hope of an historic domestic and @entity91 double			1
powerful : a breakdown of how the @entity13 have racked up their tries since 2010 turnaround : @entity2 is back in contention for an @entity26 call - up after his impressive form of late @entity99 fly - half @entity100 has been cited for alleged eye - gouging against @entity88 ’s @entity102 in friday ’s @entity10 semi-final defeat			1
if found guilty , @entity100 could be banned for up to three years			0
saracens are doubtful about the participation of talismanic captain @entity106 in next saturday ’s @entity4 final against @entity108 after he left the field to a standing ovation with 10 minutes remaining , clutching his shoulder			1
the former @entity26 captain will retire at the end of the season , when he is expected to join former @entity13 coach @entity115 on @entity117 ’s coaching team ahead of next year ’s @entity118 , and he had been hoping for a fairytale ending to his playing career			2
that now looks in jeopardy after it emerged that @entity106 - the most capped @entity10 player of all time - has been suffering from the injury for six weeks			0
battle : @entity28 of @entity8 ( right ) is tackled by @entity2 during the @entity10 semi-final ‘ we hope he is ok because a career as wonderful as his does not deserve to finish now , ’ said @entity13 director of rugby @entity84			1
‘ he deserves to finish in two weeks ’ time			0
we ’ll know more in the next 48 hours			0
’ @entity8 full back @entity19 is also an injury concern for @entity132 after he was forced off late in the game suffering pain in his hamstring and lower groin			0
@entity19 is understood to have complained at half - time about the synthetic @entity139 pitch catching his studs and causing difficulties with his running style			0
he will be monitored by @entity26 and @entity8 medics over the next 48 hours .			0
