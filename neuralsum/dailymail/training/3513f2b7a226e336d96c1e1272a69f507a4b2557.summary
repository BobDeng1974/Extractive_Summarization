this is the shocking scene that confronted a student when he discovered a car windscreen smashed to pieces by a swan			1
@entity7 undergraduate @entity6 , 20 , was on his way to morning lectures when he noticed the car had been damaged			1
the windscreen was smashed and had buckled slightly and there was a prostrate swan lying next to it on the pavement			1
@entity7 undergraduate @entity6 was on his way into lectures when he noticed his neighbour 's car had been damaged - and spotted a swan lying next to it mr @entity6 immediately called the @entity21 who soon arrived at the scene and took the swan to a rescue centre , but so far vets have been unable to work out how the swan managed to smash into the car			1
they believe the swan could have collapsed mid-flight - or may even have flown straight into the windshield			2
the black @entity31 was parked on a residential street in the student area of the city			2
mr @entity6 , a third - year history student , told student newspaper @entity35 : ' i 'd only been awake for ten minutes so i rubbed my eyes to double check it [ the swan ] was real			1
' i presumed it was dead , but then it started honking and that 's when i noticed the car next to it with the windscreen smashed in			1
mr @entity6 said his friend @entity46 was gutted it shattered her windscreen			1
he said : ' it could have thought it was a river and when it 's coming down , it must be pretty hard for a big bird like that to stop			2
' it must have been a pretty hard impact , it was a big thing too			0
i know you get birds flying into windows but it should n't have hit a car			2
' when i saw the damage i went round ringing on all the houses to see whose car it was because the owner might have thought someone had vandalised their car			2
' when i realised it was @entity46 's car , i told her			0
' he added : ' she lives on the next street over but parked on our road because there were no spaces			0
' she said the windscreen is a total right off - it 's just bad luck			0
' @entity21 vets put the swan down because its injuries were so severe - they have not been able to find out out if the bird fell or flew into the car ( pictured are the @entity21 headquarters in @entity85 , @entity86 ) ' trying to be @entity87 i deduced it must have fallen onto the car and bounced off			1
' an @entity21 spokesman said : ' we were called to an incident in @entity7 where an adult swan had fallen from the sky and crashed in to a car windscreen on tuesday morning			1
' the swan 's chest injuries were so severe vets were unable to find the original reason for the swan 's collapse			1
the representative added : ' sadly the injuries the swan sustained in the fall were very severe and on vets advice he was put to sleep			1
' it is a mystery as to why this happened and the only thing we can put it down to is exhaustion			0
' the @entity115 's swan keeper said the may have mistaken the wet road for a river in the sun 's early morning glint			2
professor @entity121 , who has been @entity115 's @entity122 since 1993 , said : ' especially in dawn and dusk they mistake the wet road for a river and try and land on it			0
' at this time of year when the sun 's low and the roads are wet the @entity21 and swan rescuers get called out quite regularly to roads where they have crashed			1
' they should n't fly into cars but it can happen			0
' as the first person to be the @entity122 he has met the @entity115 several times and is in charge of the annual @entity142 , where the birds are counted in a census			0
the former @entity146 researcher added : ' they are at the top end of the limits for a flying bird they can only take off really slowly and they do n't have much ability for sudden manoeuvres			0
' when the sun 's coming up or going down and it 's wet , the road can have a glint			0
that 's my bet for what happened			0
' mr @entity164 , who shares his home with five other students , added : ' i rang my flatmates after the @entity168 , they do n't usually get out of bed until ten but they woke up straight away when they got the phone call from me			0
' they saw the photo and thought it was totally bizarre			0
