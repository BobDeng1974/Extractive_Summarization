two - time @entity0 champions @entity0 kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout phase of the @entity3 as they beat @entity6 basement side @entity4 32 - 17			1
the sides , occupying @entity9 's bottom two slots coming into the game , shared four tries in the first half			1
@entity13 and @entity14 crossed for @entity0 , while @entity15 and @entity16 dotted down for the hosts in reply			2
after the break it was a tense affair , but the @entity22 side pulled away in the final 10 minutes with a penalty try and a @entity24 touch down after @entity25 was sent to the sin bin			1
@entity27 skips away from @entity25 as @entity0 pulled off a vital away win at @entity6 side @entity29 the win leaves @entity0 in third place in @entity33 , but they will now be within striking of distance of whoever loses when @entity37 and @entity38 go head to head			1
@entity0 full back @entity13 opened the scoring after five minutes , finishing off a move started when fly - half @entity43 intercepted an ill - judged pass			1
six minutes later , @entity29 answered back			0
@entity46 barged his way over , following a break from the club 's summer marquee signing @entity25			1
two minutes later , @entity0 ' number eight @entity14 brushed aside the last despairing line of @entity29 ' overstretched defence to dive over			1
@entity29 ' @entity54 's penalty from near halfway hit the crossbar in the 17th minute , and his radar was off again five minutes later , as he fired a second effort wide of the uprights			2
@entity24 needs help from two team - mates as he brings down @entity61 @entity43 , however , made no mistake with a penalty to take the score to 15 - 7 with 14 minutes of the opening period remaining			2
but still the first - half scoring was not over			0
@entity29 ' centre @entity16 thumped the ball down following a catch - and - drive after 33 minutes			0
@entity54 converted to make it 15 - 14 at the interval			0
the second period started slowly by comparison			0
it took 10 minutes for either side to cross the line - and when the hosts did @entity61 's try was ruled out for offside			1
three minutes later @entity54 had the chance to fire @entity29 into the lead for the first time - but he mishit his kick and it fell a long way short of the posts			0
in the early part of the second period neither side could find a way through shored - up defences , as the game turned into a middle - of - the - field battle - though it was @entity29 who looked the most dangerous and who were enjoying the lion 's share of the possession			2
@entity25 , who was sin - binned late on for a high tackle , can not escape the @entity0 defence with another @entity29 ' attack going nowhere , @entity98 was forced into a drop goal attempt but his effort slipped wide			1
full back @entity102 took over kicking duties for the hosts when @entity105 replaced @entity54 in the 64th minute			0
his first job - three minutes later - was to fire @entity29 into the lead for the first time from the touchline			0
but their lead would last just two minutes			0
@entity43 supplied the perfect @entity0 ' riposte with a penalty after @entity29 were penalised at the breakdown			0
@entity43 kicked 13 points as @entity0 kept their hopes of qualification from @entity119 alive in @entity120 @entity0 thought @entity27 had finished off a simple yet effective move in the corner with 10 minutes left on the clock , but video replays showed @entity25 had , somehow , at the last , held up the ball			1
but the @entity126 was then sent to the sin bin for a high tackle - and referee @entity129 awarded a penalty try			0
there was still time for @entity24 to barge his way over for @entity0 ' fourth try six minutes from time to seal the match .			2

@entity0 score four tries to beat @entity6 's bottom side
tense affair *settled* in *closing* minutes after @entity25 sin - binned
wasps stay third in @entity119 but touch with top two sides
