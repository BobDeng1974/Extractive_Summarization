by @entity0 pastor @entity1 has announced a new diet book that he has written combining nutritional tips and biblical lessons to help heavy congregants lose weight			1
the pastor lost 65 pounds by sticking with a tailored diet plan in 2011 but then gained just over half of that back after his 27 - year - old son killed himself earlier this year			1
@entity1 , who heads a group of @entity12 megachurches , became a best - selling author with his book 1995 the @entity14 , but now he teamed up with a group of doctors to turn his focus towards congregants ' physical health and created ' the @entity20 '			1
leading by example : @entity1 said he had been gaining weight steadily for years ( pictured at left in 2008 and right this october ) but started actively dieting in 2011 ' you think that @entity25 is only interested in your soul ? no , he is interested in your body , mind and soul			1
@entity30 went into each village teaching , preaching and healing			2
the @entity20 has to do with healing , ' he told @entity34			2
helping hand : tv personality dr @entity36 is one of three doctors that helped @entity1 develop his diet ' the @entity40 says , " @entity25 made my body ; @entity30 died for my body ; the spirit lives in my body			1
" so i had better take care of it			2
' @entity1 's book , which comes out tomorrow , suggests a five - pronged approach that tells followers to seek help with their diet through food , fitness , focus , faith and friends			1
as with so much of his life , the diet 's name is based off scripture : a chapter in the @entity40 tells how a @entity61 noble named @entity20 was tasked with eating healthy food as opposed to the rich diet of the king			2
' we just took the title from that concept			0
it does n't try to follow what @entity20 ate , because the @entity40 does n't tell us exactly what he ate , ' @entity1 told @entity34			1
' the line we use is : " if it grows on a plant , it 's healthy			0
if it 's made in a plant , do n't eat it			0
" my rule is no snacks , no sweets , no seconds			0
' he first tried losing weight in conjunction with his congregants in 2010 after realizing that so many of them - himself included - were overweight			1
at the time , the 6 - foot 3 - inch preacher weighed 295 pounds			1
he teamed up with dr @entity36 , dr @entity89 and dr @entity90 to develop the regime that helped him lose nearly a third of his body weight			0
while the initial development of the diet started two years ago , he ' relapsed ' this spring after his son @entity96 killed himself			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity97 spoke to @entity99 's @entity98 in a tell - all interview months later , opening up about his son 's mental illness			1
‘ the day that i had feared might happen one day since he 'd been born and the day that i had prayed would never happen , happened , ’ he said in september			0
ailing : @entity1 lost 65 pounds in 2011 but this summer he gained half of that back following the suicide of his son @entity96 , which he detailed in an interview alongside his wife @entity97 in september ( pictured ) the grief that came after his son 's death brought back at least 25 pounds			1
' my back went out , and i was n't able to exercise for an extended period			2
i did n't feel like doing anything , and our members who are so loving were bringing us meals every night			0
they were n't necessarily healthy meals			0
they were rich in creams and enormous portions , far more than we could possibly eat			0
i was n't making some good choices in terms of what i ate , ' he told @entity34			0
' i did n't sleep well for months , and when you do n't sleep well , your hunger level goes up			0
i fell off the wagon			0
all those pounds i had lost kept finding me			2

pastor @entity1 realized that he and many of his congregants at @entity135 were overweight in 2011
he lost 65 pounds after working with a team of doctors
he gained almost half of that back this year after his son @entity96 killed himself in april of this year
now is releasing a self - help diet book telling his plan
