by @entity0 people suffering from schizophrenia can often hear imaginary voices so terrifying that they are left traumatised			0
one @entity5 patient described the voices as ‘ like torturing people , to take their eye out with a fork , or cut someone 's head and drink their blood			1
’ a study has now found that these voices can be shaped by culture , with @entity17 cultures experiencing far more disturbing psychotic episodes			0
people suffering from schizophrenia can often hear imaginary voices so terrifying that they are left traumatised.one @entity5 patient described the voices as ‘ like torturing people , to take their eye out with a fork , or cut someone 's head and drink their blood ’ schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder that can cause people to hear ' voices ' that other people do n't hear			1
it affects about one per cent of the global population over the age of 18			0
many people in @entity17 cultures have reported hearing voices claiming other people are reading their minds , controlling their thoughts or plotting to kill them			0
in @entity41 and @entity42 , however , these hallucinatory voices appear as harmless and even playful , according to the study by @entity44 in @entity45			1
while there 's no cure for schizophrenia , this study suggests that therapies urging patients to develop relationships with their imaginary voices could prove useful			2
as part of the study , professor @entity53 interviewed 60 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia ; 20 each in @entity57 , @entity45 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ; and @entity60 , @entity42			1
overall , there were 31 women and 29 men with an average age of 34 , who were asked about their relationship with the imaginary voices			0
as part of the study , professor @entity53 interviewed 60 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia ; 20 each in @entity57 , @entity45 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ; and @entity60 , @entity42 while many of the @entity41 and @entity42 subjects registered largely positive experiences with their voices , not one @entity5 did			1
instead , the @entity5 subjects were more likely to report experiences as violent and hateful @entity41 and @entity42 registered largely positive experiences with their voices , but not one @entity5 did			1
in @entity5 , the voices were an intrusion and a threat to one 's private world – the voices could not be controlled			1
however , in @entity42 and @entity41 , the subjects were not as troubled by the voices – they seemed on one level to make sense			1
the @entity5 mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices			2
but among the @entity42 in @entity60 , more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks			2
several @entity42 also heard the voices as playful , as manifesting spirits or magic , and even as entertaining			0
the difference may be down to the fact that @entity96 and @entity5 tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity , said professor @entity53			1
whereas outside the @entity102 , people imagine the mind and self as interwoven with others and defined through relationships			1
for instance , they spoke of their voices as a call to battle or war – ' the warfare of everyone just yelling			0
' the @entity5 mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices , according to professor @entity53			2
but among the @entity42 in @entity60 , more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks			2
' they talk as if elder people advising younger people , ' one subject said			0
that contrasts to the @entity5 , only two of whom heard family members			0
the @entity42 also heard fewer threatening voices than the @entity5 – several heard the voices as playful , as manifesting spirits or magic , and even as entertaining			2
finally , not as many of them described the voices in terms of a medical or psychiatric problem , as all of the @entity5 did			0
in @entity58 , @entity59 , where the culture accepts that disembodied spirits can talk , few subjects described voices in brain disease terms			1
when people talked about their voices , 10 of them called the experience predominantly positive ; 16 of them reported hearing @entity144 audibly			0
' mostly , the voices are good , ' one participant remarked			0
the difference may be down to the fact that @entity96 and @entity5 tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity , said professor @entity53			1
whereas outside the @entity102 , people imagine the mind and self as interwoven with others and defined through relationships			1
in @entity5 , the voices were an intrusion and a threat to one 's private world – the voices could not be controlled			1
professor @entity53 ( pictured ) said the results suggests that therapies urging patients to develop relationships with their hallucinated voices could prove useful however , in @entity42 and @entity41 , the subjects were not as troubled by the voices – they seemed on one level to make sense in a more relational world			1
still , differences existed between the participants in @entity42 and @entity41 ; the former 's voice - hearing experience emphasised playfulness and sex , whereas the latter more often involved the voice of @entity144			2
' the difference seems to be that the @entity60 and @entity58 participants were more comfortable interpreting their voices as relationships and not as the sign of a violated mind , ' the researchers wrote			1
the research , professor @entity53 observed , suggests that the ' harsh , violent voices so common in the @entity102 may not be an inevitable feature of schizophrenia			0
' the findings may be clinically significant , according to the researchers and adds to research that shows specific therapies may alter what patients hear their voices say			0
' our hunch is that the way people think about thinking changes the way they pay attention to the unusual experiences associated with sleep and awareness , and that as a result , people will have different spiritual experiences , as well as different patterns of psychiatric experience , ' professor @entity53 said			0
the @entity5 mostly did not know who spoke to them and they seemed to have less personal relationships with their voices			0
but among the @entity42 in @entity60 , more than half heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks			2

*scientists* came to the conclusion after speaking with 60 schizophrenics
20 came from @entity45 , 20 from @entity58 , @entity59 and 20 from @entity60 , @entity42
in @entity5 , voices were intrusion and a threat to patient 's private world
in @entity42 and @entity41 , the study subjects were not as troubled by the voices
the difference may be down to the fact that @entity96 and @entity5 tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity
whereas outside the @entity102 , people imagine the mind and self as interwoven with others and defined through relationships
