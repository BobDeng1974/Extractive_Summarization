@entity0 open as favourites to secure the @entity3 broadcasting rights for the richest fight of all time , at roughly the same 1 - 3 odds at which the @entity8 casinos are quoting @entity10 to win it			1
but when you are talking hundreds of millions of dollars and the two best pound - for - pound boxers in the world there are no foregone conclusions			0
and when it comes to a bidding war for @entity20 vs @entity21 , nothing will come cheap for @entity3 viewers			1
@entity20 tucks into a bag of popcorn and a hotdog during a basketball match in @entity27 on sunday @entity20 announced that he would fight @entity21 last week to end weeks of speculation @entity29 have become a @entity31 thorn in @entity0 's side			1
they have been fidgeting for some time about adding live boxing to their portfolio and there could be no more spectacular way than this of throwing their hat in the ring			0
certainly , they can afford it			0
the cost frame for screening rights in this country on the red - hot saturday night of may 2 at the @entity48 is expected to be £ 5million - £ 10m , with @entity0 likely to start pitching at £ 6m			1
but the fiercer the competition the higher it could go , even though @entity51 and the @entity21 will not enter the ring much before 4am sunday morning @entity3 time			1
@entity29 possess untold riches and have not blinked at £ 10m per @entity31 match			1
they also kept significant cash in hand by shrewdly under - bidding @entity0 while still expanding their package in that new deal			2
with all due respect , if @entity61 vs @entity62 is worth that kind of money then what price this fight so big that @entity21 ’s promoter @entity66 describes it as ‘ three @entity67 rolled into one ' ? @entity21 stretches before a training session the @entity70 as he prepares for @entity20 @entity71 plays chess with friends in @entity74 as he trains at home before moving to @entity27 @entity21 has been in training for @entity20 in anticipation that the fight would be made for may twenty million , thirty million , given that @entity80 television will generate $ 300m ? and @entity29 are not the only potential rivals to @entity0			1
@entity82 are bringing world championship boxing back to mainstream terrestrial television for the first time in almost a decade with this saturday ’s defence by @entity87 of his super-bantamweight title against @entity90 in @entity91			2
@entity92 – not only live on the night but with replays airing sunday lunchtime and on prime evening slots the following week – will bring with it expensive advertising opportunities			0
nor – unlike @entity98 – are @entity82 prohibited by their constitution from charging pay - per - view			1
they have not gone down this road before but what better way for them to take a first big step back into the big - time sports market ? also , @entity110 ’s dedicated @entity109 channel is believed to be considering adding a comparatively modest one - off pay - per - view supplement to its £ 12 - a - month subscription rates for this event of such magnitude			1
@entity110 - like @entity29 - can calculate a bid based on that charge plus a substantial surge in subscribers			2
he has also built up much goodwill with the @entity80 promoters by buying many of their big fights even when @entity3 boxers are not involved – @entity20 vs @entity126 and @entity21 vs @entity127 significantly among them			1
@entity20 talked to @entity21 at a basketball match ( left ) before meeting him at his hotel suite later ( right ) @entity20 posted an photograph of the signed contract for his fight against @entity21 and what may the cost be to you , dear reader , boxing lover or member of the wider audience which this will attract ? @entity0 , conscious of the scale of their monthly fees , are deeply reluctant to raise any pay - per - view charge above their historic £ 20 thresh - hold			1
if they stick to that , their critics may become their friends			0
but they will be desperate not to lose out on this one and the more they have to pay , the greater the pressure to charge more			0
but however much you end up being asked to cough up , it will be peanuts compared with @entity80			2
@entity154 , who have @entity20 under contract , and @entity157 , who are @entity21 ’s paymasters , are sharing the broadcast there – at an expected $ 99.95 a buy			1
what they have to assess is that while @entity20 and @entity21 are guaranteed $ 150m ( £ 96 ) and $ 100m ( £ 64 ) respectively , the local stations who take their satellite feeds get their share			1
that is normally 50 per cent , although there is talk of a lower percentage being agreed this time given the size of the pay - per - view charge			1
the @entity80 pay - per - view sales record is 2.4million buyers for @entity20 vs @entity177 in 2007			1
that is predicted to be broken now			0
@entity20 's victory over @entity177 in 2007 set the pay - per - view sales record of 2.4million buyers even i can do the arithmetic that at a hundred bucks a shot three million buys equals $ 300m			1
at that rate , if the local stations take a third that leaves $ 200m in the promotion pot. then come the overseas tv rights in some 200 countries , including @entity3 where sales should exceed the 1.2m record set for @entity20 vs @entity194 , which was also an early - hours production			1
seats at the arena will be priced up to $ 5,000 ( £ 3,300 ) or more at ringside – and are already selling on an advance promise on the black market for more than $ 25,000 ( £ 16,500 )			0
the @entity201 , whose group of hotels on that famous @entity8 will be the principle beneficiaries of a gaming bonanza that weekend worth anything up to a billion dollars to @entity8 , will pay a substantial site fee			2
it will cost $ 150 or more to watch closed - circuit transmission on large screens in their hotels			2
a movie chain in @entity80 is negotiating to show the fight live in several hundred theatres – and it could be coming to a cinema near you , as did events such as this in years gone by			2
the feeding frenzy has begun			0
tickets for the fight at the @entity48 are already selling on the black market for more than £ 16,500 @entity20 tells @entity21 : ‘ you ’re moving up into a different league where you ’ve never been and that ’s why i ’m 1 - 3 in the betting			1
’ the @entity21 tells the @entity228 : ‘ i love being the underdog and you ca n’t cope with my speed			0
’ @entity21 : ' i signed the contract first			0
' @entity20 : ' i made it happen			0
' there wo n’t be many rounds this even on may 2			0
@entity238 has accepted not only @entity240 ’s challenge to a fight but also a $ 1m ( £ 650,000 ) side stake			2
@entity238 smiled and said ‘ sure ’ when @entity243 said he wanted to bet him that he will knock out the @entity245 at super-middleweight			0
that requires @entity238 to move up from middleweight , where he is world champion following 29 stoppages in 32 unbeaten fights , including the last 19 in succession			0
as the biggest pound - for - pound puncher in the world @entity238 has trouble finding big - name opponents and says he will gladly rise to the 12 stone limit to face @entity243 and that bet ‘ assuming he signs the contract this time			0
’ @entity243 is committed to an interim fight in april and is @entity263 ’s target for his much - wanted fight in @entity8 , perhaps this summer			2
@entity238 , ever the gentleman , took time out to pose for a morning - after photograph in @entity266 with his latest victim , our own @entity267 who courageously took him as far the 11th round for the first time in his career before suffering a brutal stoppage on saturday night			0
@entity238 ( left ) invited @entity267 for a drink the morning after he stopped the @entity275 man @entity238 was taken to the 11th round for the first time in his career but dominated against @entity267			0

@entity10 takes on @entity21 in @entity8 on may 2
@entity80 fans will be charged $ 95.95 to watch the fight on pay - per - view
@entity0 , @entity282 and @entity82 could bid to show it in the @entity3
the rights are expected to cost between £ 5m and £ 10m
