the 23 - year - old @entity14 was clearly pleased with the job , declaring it was ' beautiful ' , but the pair were both in a more serious frame of mind when their match began at 1.30pm			2
however the friendly smiles quickly turned to angry grimaces , on @entity1 's part at least , as he dropped first one set , then another , and then another , losing to the @entity14 in straight sets			2
the home audience howled in despair as he dropped point after point and it became increasingly clear that the reigning champion was not going to hang on to his title			2
