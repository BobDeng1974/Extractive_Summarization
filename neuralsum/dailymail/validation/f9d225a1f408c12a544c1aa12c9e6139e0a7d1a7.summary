eventually he snapped , trudging off the field after 75 minutes and wondering when his next game in a @entity4 shirt will be			1
this has been brewing for a while , simmering in the background at a time when @entity9 needs his first choice striker out on the pitch in the final , decisive nine games of the season			0
@entity14 , this hot - head in a @entity4 shirt , has tweaked his hamstring again and @entity9 will expect his prized forward to barter his way out of @entity21 's two games during the international break			1
this time the complaint felt legit , particularly as the score was delicately balanced at 2 - 2 at the @entity25 when @entity14 signalled for help			1
@entity4 striker @entity14 was forced off with a hamstring injury during the @entity29 ' 3 - 2 win over @entity30 @entity14 ( left ) talks to manager @entity9 ( right ) before he is substituted at @entity25 on sunday his replacement , @entity33 , answered the sos by scoring @entity4 's winner with his first touch			1
it was a shame to see @entity14 disappear down the tunnel , particularly after he had joined @entity39 at the top of the scoring charts in the @entity42 with a rasping effort to put @entity4 2 - 0 ahead			1
instead @entity21 , who have a @entity46 qualifier against @entity47 to play on friday , and a friendly with @entity49 the following tuesday will dictate when the forward plays again			1
@entity9 has an uneasy relationship with @entity21 coach @entity52 and with that in mind , his adopted country are likely to demand that he is assessed by their own doctors			2
' when the team needs a goal with 15 minutes to go and the striker has a lot of experience with hamstring injuries and says it 's over , it 's over			2
' we know his hamstring is not strong			0
now he has 15 days without football , but we never cry about our injured players			0
' he has had this problem since he tried to play in the @entity71 final against @entity72			0
' there has been talk of an operation at the end of the season , some serious discussions between @entity4 's medical staff about a permanent solution			1
' dr @entity82 ( @entity4 's medical director ) is against knives , against surgery , ' admitted @entity9			1
' he 's all in favour of conservative work and collective work between the medical department and fitness staff			0
this is the direction , we believe			0
' @entity14 had scored @entity4 's second goal as they stormed into a 2 - 0 lead within 10 minutes on sunday it has been another eventful game for @entity14 , full of sly digs and elbows again as he responded to the prods in the back from @entity99 's players			1
everyone tries to work him over these days			0
there was a flashpoint , of course there was , because that is the way @entity14 plays the game			2
he snarls , he snaps , he scores			0
here at the @entity25 , after @entity30 had pegged back @entity4 amid raucous scenes in the stands , he threw half an elbow in the direction of @entity112			1
it was not seen by @entity114 , the referee who also failed to spot @entity14 raking his studs down @entity120 during the volatile @entity118 semi-final second leg at @entity119			2
on this occasion he is expected to escape			0
@entity30 were able to draw level before half - time and when @entity14 was subbed off the scores were locked at 2 - 2 the real punishment was for @entity30 , beaten by the boot of @entity33 just a couple of minutes after he had replaced @entity127 as a substitute			1
he is a useful back - up , full of energy and enthusiasm despite his lack of minutes			0
@entity9 had every reason to be grateful to him			0
' every time he plays here is there and he probably deserves more than i give him , ' admitted a mightily relieved @entity9			0
' there are not many times when a coach owes something to a player , but with @entity33 that 's the case			2
every time he plays he gives us a lot			0
' after scoring the winner here for @entity4 , he has earned a break			2
@entity33 scored the winning goal for @entity4 and his contributions could prove vital in @entity14 's absence			1

@entity14 scored @entity4 's second goal against @entity30 on sunday
however , the forward was forced off with an injury after 75 minutes
it *remains* to be seen whether or not @entity14 will play for @entity21 during the international break
@entity33 , his replacement , entered the game with the score at 2 - 2
@entity33 's winning goal *suggests* that he can fill the void in @entity14 's absence
