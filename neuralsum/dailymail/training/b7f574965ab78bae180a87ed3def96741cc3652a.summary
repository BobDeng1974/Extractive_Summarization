a tortoise was taken for an emergency visit to the vet after he got an electrical cable stuck under his shell			2
mr @entity5 , a giant african spurred tortoise , was stretching his legs on owner @entity9 's lawn when he became entangled in the cable from a garden strimmer			1
fortunately , vets were able to free the cable from around the animal 's neck and remove the plug that was wedged under his shell			1
and today mr @entity5 was pictured back in the garden			1
tangled : mr @entity5 had the garden strimmer cable wrapped around his body and the plug wedged under his shell back in action : today the tortoise was seen walking happily around mrs @entity9 's garden beloved : mrs @entity9 , pictured with her pet , got mr t when he was the ' size of a 50p piece ' mrs @entity9 , 60 , has owned mr @entity5 , whose shell now weighs 11.7kg , ' since he was as big as a 50p piece '			1
she said that it was ' panic stations ' when her beloved six - year - old pet got into trouble in the garden			0
she said : ' my son @entity34 was putting the strimmer away when mr @entity5 walked over the wire and got it wrapped around his neck and the three pin plug stuck under his shell and between it and his front leg			1
' ' @entity34 was very calm but i was really panicking as we tried to pull him loose and we could n’t get him free			2
' his head was stuck outside his shell when his natural response was to try and go back into the shell which really did n’t help things			0
' the two had to cut the strimmer wire before rushing to vets near their home in @entity52 , @entity53			2
@entity54 : ' we had never had anything like this in the clinic before - most tortoises are smaller than mr @entity5 and we think it was his large size that enabled this accident to happen			1
' mr @entity5 was left with just minor bruising after vets and allowed home , where mrs @entity9 's family have since been doting on him			1
mrs @entity9 added : ' i wanted to make sure he was okay so i ’ve been gently stroking his shell to keep him calm and shutting his eyes			0
' he loves banana and soon he was back to normal munching away			0
in the summer he goes in and out of the house and in the winter he will come inside with me where he’l sit under his sun lamp			0
stuck : the giant african spurred tortoise was walking in its owners garden when it became entangled ' bizarre accident ' : vets were able to free @entity81 's beloved six - year - old pet after the incident doting : mrs @entity9 's grandchildren , six - year - old @entity84 and @entity85 , three , are now busy looking after mr @entity86 ' i was really worried that they would n’t be able to get the wire and plug out of his shell but the vets were marvellous and i ca n’t thank them enough for all they did for mr @entity93 ’s one very lucky tortoise			1
' the @entity94 spurred , or sulcata , tortoise , gets its name from the ' spurs ' - enlarged bony scales on its hind legs			2
native to @entity94 countries including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 - the animal lives in areas where there may be no rain for several years			0
in the wild they depend on succulent plants for food and water			0
this species of tortoise , which can live for more than 50 years , need to be carefully looked after and require specialist handling and treatment , otherwise they can suffer painful and potentially fatal diseases .			0
