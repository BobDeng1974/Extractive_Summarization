a church is all that remains of the small village of @entity2 in the state of @entity4 in @entity5			1
the town was completely blanketed after the eruption of @entity8 in 1943			1
for the next eight years , lava flowed freely , burying the town underneath feet of volcanic rock - though its church survived unscathed			2
the volcanic eruption was particularly unique as its entire evolution was observed and studied			0
many also consider this volcano , and adjacent lava - covered village , to be one of the natural wonders of the world			0
under the church , houses and other buildings remain buried , though thankfully no residents were injured during the extended eruption			0
while some like to believe that it 's ability to withstand the lava was an act from above , the solid slabs used to build the structure have also been credited			1
even today , the haunting images show a stark contrast between the barren ground and the holy building			0

the small village of @entity2 in @entity5 is completely buried under lava , save for its church
this is *due* to the eight - year eruption of @entity8 , which began in 1943
many credit the structure 's solid slabs with its ability to withstand the constant flow of heat
