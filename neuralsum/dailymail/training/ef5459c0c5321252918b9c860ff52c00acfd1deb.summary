by @entity0 speaking out : four years into his premiership , mr @entity1 has spoken for the first time about his darkest moments , distant memories and preference for trash tv it is an issue which can bring even the happiest couple close to blows : who controls the television remote control			1
and it is no different when @entity1 and his wife @entity13 sit down in front of the box in their @entity16 flat			0
he has revealed that he does what millions of men do : grabs hold of the remote and channel hops from one ‘ rubbish ’ programme to another			1
and mrs @entity26 does what millions of women married to such men do : stomps off in exasperation			0
in one of his most candid and intimate interviews since becoming prime minister , mr @entity1 has told @entity34 that : in the interview with @entity36 on sunday editor @entity37 , mr @entity1 confesses to the ‘ annoying male habit of channel - surfing ’ on the tv			1
‘ i watch a lot of rubbish , ’ he admits			2
‘ i love murder mysteries and things like that on a sunday night to escape from it all			2
’ asked who controls the remote , him or @entity13 , he pleaded guilty : ‘ i drive her mad because i sometimes watch more than one thing at a time , and then she ’ll leave the room			2
’ however , mr @entity1 is rather more strict when it comes to what his three children , @entity54 , six , @entity55 , seven and @entity56 , three , do for entertainment			2
off duty : the prime minister with his family including @entity62 , left , who died in 2009			1
mr @entity1 blasts those who try to search for a ' silver lining ' to the tragedy that shook his family in the year before the last election they are banned from having video games , mobile phones or tablets ( though they are allowed to use their parents ’ @entity74 ‘ from time to time ’ ) and on weekend mornings are banned from watching tv			1
‘ i try to get them away from the @entity79 channels to watch nature programmes , ’ he said			2
‘ we try to limit screen time			0
at the weekend : no television in the morning			2
we do n’t do morning tv – they should be doing something			1
’ the rules seem to be working			0
he says @entity55 ‘ plays a lot of football and rugby ’ and had tried his hand at djing at a friend ’s party , while @entity54 was taking part in ‘ an amateur opera			2
’ similarly , traditionalist mr @entity1 has avoided telling them about ‘ twerking , ’ the provocative dance made famous by pop star @entity99 , who previously starred in the children ’s tv series @entity102			1
traditionalist : mr @entity1 revealed he refuses to give his children mobile phones or music and video gaming devices			1
he will also try his best to keep them from discovering what ' twerking ' means ‘ my children are too young			1
luckily they have n’t connected this lovely @entity102 , who is now this person twerking			0
’ but he may be fighting a losing battle : they have already noticed swearing in pop songs			0
‘ they say , “ @entity117 , that ’s the bad this or that word			0
” they are very conscious of that and they do n’t approve of swearing			0
‘ they are quite right – the artists are wrong to swear , although i ca n’t say i totally live by those rules myself			1
’ the prime minister reflects more sombrely on the deaths of his father @entity129 in 2010 and his disabled son @entity62 in 2009 , venting his frustration with those who told him ‘ some good ’ could come out of such a tragedy			1
talent : @entity1 , seen eating breakfast at @entity136 , also revealed he played the drums at @entity138 ‘ even though @entity62 was very disabled and very ill , it was all just a total shock			1
we had no idea he was going to suddenly die in the way he did , ’ he said			0
‘ but the person who says to you , “ there ’s a silver lining to all this , ” or “ some good will come of all this , ” you actually want to thump			1
‘ it ’s the most annoying thing anybody can possibly say			0
’ reflecting on his own childhood , mr @entity1 praised his favourite teacher at @entity138 , the ‘ wonderful ’ @entity154 who ‘ woke me up to the excitement of history ’ and he revealed a modest , musical talent : he had played the drums in a school band – and ‘ once stood in for someone in a jazz band , for one night only ’			1
he also talked about his religious beliefs , saying : ‘ i ’m a classic @entity163 member , but part of its strength is the fact that it does n’t ask us to sign up to too much of a canon ... but i ’ve always found the teachings of @entity172 and the @entity173 quite useful as a sort of handy guide			1
‘ but there are plenty of other guides you could use			0
i find this one works for me			0
’ @entity1 has taken a swipe at @entity181 following his claims that the prime minister was a ‘ complete idiot ’ for the way he plans to mark the centenary of the @entity187			1
the @entity189 host has said he is ‘ troubled ’ over mr @entity1 ’s plans to ‘ celebrate such a calamity ’ – and has denounced education secretary @entity192 for calling the conflict ‘ just ’			1
now mr @entity1 has criticised mr @entity181 ’s book on @entity196 history , saying he preferred a work by @entity198 , which salutes our military victories			0
conflict : @entity1 's plans to mark the centenary of @entity187 were branded ' idiotic ' by @entity181			0
but he has hit back by dismissing the @entity189 presenter 's book , @entity206 's @entity187 and in his interview with @entity36 on sunday editor @entity37 , the prime minister used near - identical language to his political and personal confidant , mr @entity192 to describe the @entity187			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ we should be clear that @entity187 was a war fought in a just cause , that our ancestors thought it would be bad to have a @entity215 - dominated @entity214 , and that is why they fought			0
‘ one can read the poems of @entity218 and find them extremely moving but still understand why @entity206 went to war in 1914 and what the consequences would have been had we not			0
’ mr @entity181 – whose latest book @entity206 ’s @entity187 describes the conflict as the point where @entity196 realised their future ‘ would never be as grand as their past ’ – criticised the description , ‘ a just war ’ when mr @entity192 used it , saying : ‘ i ’m not sure it ’s a helpful phrase			1
’ mr @entity1 , who for @entity232 gave each of his eight godchildren a copy of @entity237 ’s ‘ brilliant ’ war book @entity236 , was speaking two weeks before mr @entity192 rounded on left - wing academics for using fictions such as @entity240 to ‘ feed the myth ’ that @entity187 was ‘ unpatriotic ’ and a ‘ misbegotten shambles ’			2
his words came weeks before @entity192 attacked left - wing academics and @entity240 for ' feeding a myth ' mr @entity1 has another dig at mr @entity181 when he says said he had recently read two books on the @entity248 : one by @entity198 and one by mr @entity181			0
‘ @entity198 ’ book was much better , ’ he said , bluntly			2
it is the latest exchange in a war of words between both @entity254 politicians and mr @entity181 that stretches back nearly a decade			0
the tension was most obvious in a 2010 interview when mr @entity181 asked mr @entity1 six times if he would raise @entity260 , and sneered : ‘ people look at you and @entity263 and see two immensely privileged young men with a glint in their eye			1
’ gig : the prime minister and his wife @entity13 recently ' sneaked ' into a concert at @entity271 to see @entity274 sisters @entity272 and @entity275 as @entity276 the prime minister has revealed how he and his wife @entity13 recently ‘ sneaked ’ into a concert by an obscure @entity281 folk duo			1
and he admitted it was n’t the first time they had joined the audience at the @entity286 ’s @entity248 in @entity287			0
‘ there ’s quite a good way of sneaking in there , ’ he said			2
the latest visit was to see @entity274 sisters @entity272 and @entity275 , pictured left , who perform as @entity276			0
mr @entity1 , who has previously claimed to be a fan of rock bands @entity295 and @entity296 , says in today ’s @entity297 : ‘ i ’ve got into a bit of a countryish thing			0
’ @entity276 , whose sound is defined by melancholic harmonies and wistful lyrics , have yet to break into the mainstream – although they have gained a significant following online , attracting more than four million @entity306 views			2
aptly for their new fan , their tracks include one titled @entity309 – although it ’s a downbeat number about a depressed woman mourning the death of the only man she ever loved and unlikely ever to be adopted as a party anthem			0
@entity26 is also a fan – once telling fellow musicians @entity316 about their work			0
@entity272 and @entity275 – 23 and 21 respectively – come from the @entity319 suburb of @entity320 and say their music is influenced by their activism on issues including environmentalism , @entity327 and the ultimately successful campaign to free @entity330 punk band @entity329			1
@entity1 ’s music tastes have come under fire from some musicians , with @entity295 ’ @entity334 even ‘ forbidding ’ him from listening to their songs			1
but the @entity337 insists @entity295 are still played regularly at home .			0

@entity340 banned children from phones and weekend tv
uses the @entity173 as a ' handy guide ' for recognising right from wrong
most candid interview since prime minister took office four years *ago*
he has banned his children from having mobile phones or music and video game devices .
the family have a ban on watching tv on *saturday* and sunday morning .
he does not want his children to know what ‘ twerking ’ is .
he wanted to ‘ thump ’ people who said the death of his disabled son @entity62 at the age of six would ‘ have a silver lining ’ .
he played the drums in a school band at @entity138 .
he is a ‘ classic @entity163 member ’ – not the type to ‘ drop to my *knees* for *divine* *guidance* ’ and regards the @entity173 as a ‘ handy guide ’ to knowing right from wrong .
