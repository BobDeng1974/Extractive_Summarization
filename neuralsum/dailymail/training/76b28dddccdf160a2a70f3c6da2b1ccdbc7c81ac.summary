the full chaotic state of @entity2 's flagship free school meals project was exposed last night			1
@entity3 and a survey by @entity5 reveal that schools in a third of areas are still failing to give all their pupils a ' hot and nutritious ' meal			1
three months after the £ 1billion policy was supposed to have been implemented up to 30 per cent of pupils in some parts of the country are refusing the free meals and eating their own packed lunches			1
nearly 300,000 four to seven - year - olds are failing to claim their free meal , with many parents concerned over the quality of lunches at some schools			1
hot issue : @entity2 , pictured eating lunch at a primary school , as his flagship free school meal project was branded ' chaotic ' figures also show that councils have been forced to raid their budgets for millions of pounds to meet the cost of the project , despite the @entity32 claiming it was ' fully funded '			1
some schools have given up entirely on the idea of providing hot and healthy food at lunchtime			2
labour education spokesman @entity37 said : ' @entity2 's ' free ' school meals policy is clearly collapsing in chaos amid a litany of his failures to heed warnings and his broken promises to pupils and their parents			1
' he announced the policy without doing the maths first and it is families who are paying the price			2
@entity2 and the @entity32 can not be trusted			2
' it is not acceptable that schools are forced to raid their budgets to pay for a policy that was introduced on a political timetable			1
' mr @entity2 secured funding for the free school meals project in exchange for allowing the @entity57 to fulfil their manifesto commitment to a tax break for married couples			1
the government set itself the target for take - up of 87 per cent but even that level has been achieved only in about 40 per cent of local authorities			0
in total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch , compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal in total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch , compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal			2

from the 146 local authorities which replied , 46 schools said they could not offer free meals			1
of those , 40 per cent said they expected to be able to do so by the end of this year , 20 per cent said it would be achieved between january and april next year			0
but 15 per cent said they had no plans to achieve the aim , while 20 per cent said they did not know when they would			0
one third of councils said they have been forced to use existing funds to pay for the policy because the money from @entity116 did not cover costs			2
about £ 2.5million was spent by 15 councils on kitchens to make up the shortfall in funding			2
that includes £ 137,000 spent by @entity124 council in mr @entity2 's constituency of @entity126			1
some schools have had to have kitchen ' pods ' dropped in by crane while others are supplying cold , packed lunches which can be eaten at desks			0
at one unnamed school in @entity136 children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each			0
pupils were rationed according to their age , city council member @entity140 found , with @entity142 pupils receiving two nuggets and @entity145 pupils only three			0
a government spokesman said : ' we have made £ 150million available to fund new kitchen and dining facilities where needed			0
' the fact is that more than eight out of ten infants are now enjoying a free school meal at lunchtime , giving them a better start to afternoon lessons and a healthy boost for their first years in school			0
