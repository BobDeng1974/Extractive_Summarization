@entity0 says he can not defend @entity1 after admitting the @entity3 striker spitting in the face of @entity5 was worse than breaking the leg of an opponent			1
@entity3 will be without their 11 - goal top scorer for the first time at @entity10 on sunday since he was hit with a seven - game ban following the altercation with @entity5			1
the @entity14 defender was suspended for six matches for his part in the incident , in which he first spat at @entity1 to provoke the reaction from the @entity20 striker			1
@entity3 's @entity1 and @entity14 's @entity5 squared up to each other at @entity22 @entity1 has been banned for seven games , while @entity5 has received a six game suspension for the altercation there has been a lot of debate in the 10 days since the disgusting clash as to whether or not spitting merited a ban double the length of one for a tackle which could cause serious injury			1
@entity0 , though , was clear on his thoughts when that question was put to him			2
‘ when you have played the game it ( spitting ) is worse , yes , ’ he said			1
‘ it 's one of the lowest forms of anything you can do on the pitch			2
a lot of players would have acted differently			0
he retaliated in the same manner , which is just as bad			0
‘ i sat with him and i said , “ listen , i ca n't defend you on this			0
you 've done wrong and have to accept whatever punishment you get ”			0
there 's no place in the game for it			0
he got what he deserved			0
’ @entity5 ' actions have been described as ' simply disgusting ' by the @entity57 's regulatory committee both @entity5 and @entity1 were charged and banned by the @entity57 for spitting , but @entity1 admitted the offence @entity1 ’s future on @entity60 is now uncertain			1
despite boasting the best goals - per - minute ratio in the @entity63 this season , @entity3 remain concerned about a lingering knee issue for which he underwent more treatment this week			1
when asked if the 29 - year - old would be at the club next year , @entity0 said : ‘ it 's a difficult question to answer because i 'm only thinking about the now , and i have n't got him for seven games			1
‘ but he scores goals and i do n't think his knee is a big issue			1
we have always used this word “ maintenance ” about his knee and it is just making sure that everything is right			0
but he ’s a big loss			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 admits he has sympathy with under - fire @entity10 boss @entity85			2
@entity3 finished fifth in 2012 but were nearly relegated the following season and cited the rigours of a @entity89 campaign as reason for their struggle			1
‘ ask any of these managers who qualified for @entity93 how it affects your league form - you all start fighting for your lives down the bottom of that league table - it 's not easy , ’ he said			1
‘ they 've got to do something about it			0
i would go back to a straight knockout format			0
‘ when you work so hard to get your team into a position to qualify for it and then you 've got to play so many games it 's detrimental to your bread and butter , which is @entity63 football			2
‘ @entity111 have a massive squad and were almost playing two different sides			0
that 's how they coped with it – but @entity10 ca n't and we could n’t either			0
’ @entity117 admits he has sympathy with under - fire @entity10 manager @entity85 ahead of he game			2
