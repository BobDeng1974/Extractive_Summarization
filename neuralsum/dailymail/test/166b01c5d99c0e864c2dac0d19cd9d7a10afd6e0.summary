we were really , really chuffed			0
@entity14 continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning @entity21 , he shook hands with all the shop owners on the @entity18 high street			1
when @entity14 , 27 , says ' i do ' on april 11 , the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends			2
a local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window @entity14 's status as one of the world 's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from @entity172 celebrities such as @entity173 to the prime minister and even the @entity175			1
but the biggest name likely to be in attendance at @entity18 , where the couple are tying the knot , is one - time @entity10 tennis star @entity179			2
