dr @entity22 , from the @entity23 , said : ‘ we found that college students tended to drink more heavily and become more intoxicated on days they used both energy drinks and alcohol , compared to days they only used alcohol			2
’ dr @entity29 , who worked with professor @entity30 from @entity31 , says mixing alcohol with energy drinks could increase the risk of alcohol poisoning because it encourages people to drink more			1
she added it could also have other implications as it makes people more likely to be ‘ wide awake drunk ’ after a night of partying meaning they are more likely to behave in an antisocial way			1
the researchers studied 652 students and during four two - week periods they asked them to answer questions about their consumption of energy drinks and alcohol			2
they also asked them to record any problems they experienced as a result – from suffering a hangover , to getting in trouble with the police			0
dr @entity29 said : ‘ our findings suggest that the use of energy drinks and alcohol together may lead to heavier drinking and more serious alcohol - related problems			0

this means they are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour they discovered that healthy adults who consumed the drinks had significantly increased heart contraction rates one hour later			1
this means that the chamber of the heart that pumps blood around the body - the left ventricle - was contracting harder an hour after the energy drink had been consumed			0
dr @entity87 said : ' there are concerns about the products ' potential adverse side effects on heart function , especially in adolescents and young adults , but there is little or no regulation of energy drink sales			0

mixing the two is riskier than drinking alcohol alone , @entity16 researchers say
people who mix the two tend to drink more , and become drunker
also makes people more likely to be ' wide awake drunk ' meaning they are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour
