re-live all the drama here there was no transfer bombshell on deadline day at @entity4 so @entity5 took it upon himself to send a few shockwaves through the club with a damning indictment of its transfer policy			1
‘ if i was in charge , maybe i would have done things differently ’ he said at the @entity13 racing circuit in @entity4 on monday fresh from a publicity shoot for watch makers @entity15 with @entity16			1
he also added : ' i have a very clear opinions but i ca n’t always say what i think ’			2
sign here , please : @entity20 signed for @entity26 in a £ 60million @entity63 record fee move @entity4 started the month of august so well			1
they had signed three of the best performers from the last @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 and won the @entity70 against @entity71 fielding the most expensive team in history			0
what could possibly go wrong ? watching them collapse against @entity76 at the weekend albeit without @entity5 has sounded alarm bells however			1
it was not just the tactical chaos – that might be expected after so many comings and goings ; it was more the attitude questioned by @entity50 in his post match interview			0
he spoke about the weight of the @entity4 crest on the shirts and how it needed to be respected with performances worthy of it			1
@entity91 : @entity4 have also missed out on @entity25 , who signed for @entity26 on monday for @entity93 it ’s a case of back to the drawing board			1
the team he built to win the club ’s 10th @entity32 has been ripped up			0
two - thirds of the @entity29 , @entity99 , @entity100 is gone			1
the @entity101 was vital on the left of the middle three in the 4 - 3 - 3 system because he could protect the left - back ( be it @entity106 or @entity108 ) when their natural attacking tendencies left them exposed			0
@entity99 did the same on the right hand side because @entity113 , like @entity106 and @entity108 needs protecting			0
on sunday against @entity114 was left shielding @entity113 and the result was freeway of opportunity down @entity4 ’s right - hand side that @entity76 made the most of in their four goal comeback			1
video game of two halves - @entity93 bad start : @entity93 's ( right ) side were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity76 on sunday defensively the squad is untouched despite it not being too difficult to make a case for that group of four full - backs @entity106 , @entity48 , @entity129 and @entity113 needing to be freshened up			1
the decision not to sign @entity25 was explained away by an interest in protecting @entity40 who has just been given a new deal and according to general wisdom at the club , ‘ performs better when not in danger of losing his place ’			0
there was a feeling that @entity25 would take his place and would also not dovetail so nicely with @entity140 and @entity5			1
it ’s a decent argument – @entity40 is happy to make those runs away from goal that open up space for @entity140 and @entity5 that @entity25 simply does not make			1
step back ? the @entity32 winners signed @entity37 ( above ) on transfer deadline day you 're driving : @entity5 was speaking at a @entity15 event where he appeared alongside @entity16 @entity25 relies on crosses that @entity140 and @entity5 tend not to make – both like to come inside and shoot off their stronger foot rather than go on the outside and offer an assist			1
all that being the case why then buy a player who also relies on a six - yard - box service ? @entity37 is not quite @entity157 loaned to @entity4 from @entity158 in 2009 but he comes close in terms of strange unexpected signings			2
he may well score goals coming off the bench against weaker @entity164 opposition and @entity46 may well find the motivation in his final year to do @entity20 ’s midfield running			2
that would enable @entity93 to sort out the expensive mess			2
an expensive mess is after preferable to a cheap mess			0
but do n’t expect the small fact that he won the @entity32 just over 100 days ago to give him much of a grace period if he does n’t get it right quickly			0
the pressure , after an at first impressive but ultimately questionable transfer window , is most definitely on			0
' my opinion is very clear but i ca n’t always say what i think ... if i was in charge i would n’t have done things like this ... but if the president thinks the best thing for the team is to sign the players he signed and let others leave you must respect and support his decisions			2
' with the new players the style will change , but it could change for the best or the worse			0
hopefully it is for the best as they are players of a very good level			0
' @entity20 and @entity29 were very important for us , but they are no longer here and we must be happy with the new players			1
' i ’m sure it will all go well			0
@entity93 has a lot of experience and knows what the team needs and does n’t need			2
we lost but there is no need for alarm , we have to let the boss work in peace			0
' next week i will be 100 per cent for the ‘ derbi ’			0
' speed demon : @entity5 believes @entity26 have done well to land @entity25			2

@entity5 claims he ' would have done things differently ' had he been in charge of @entity4
@entity4 star hits out at loss of @entity20 and @entity29
@entity5 remains *confident* ' all will go well ' under *guidance* @entity93
