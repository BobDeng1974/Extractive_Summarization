by @entity1 reporter the failure to teach youngsters a trade has led to the end of the artisan class and forced companies to fill jobs with foreign workers , business experts have said			1
@entity11 and @entity12 – who appeared alongside @entity13 on @entity14 – claim young @entity16 adults have a sense of entitlement and are lacking in work ethic , hampering their chances of finding employment			1
speaking ahead of a documentary on migrant workers that will be broadcast next week , miss @entity22 , 62 , said : ‘ there ’s nothing unlawful about employing people at £ 11 an hour rather than £ 15 if you can get them			1
entitled : @entity11 and @entity12 - who appeared alongside on @entity14 - claim young @entity16 adults have a sense of entitlement and are lacking in work ethic , hampering their chances of finding a job ‘ but is it wrong to be @entity16 and to have a sense of entitlement ? we have decided as a nation that 50 per cent should go to university and look down on trade qualifications , and it ’s better to go and get a media studies degree that does n’t get you a job than to go and learn a trade – whereas in @entity49 , it ’s as hard to get into technical colleges as it is to get into the good universities			1
’ mr @entity11 , who now presents @entity52 , claimed the demise of the artisan class had left @entity16 ‘ teeming with bodgers ’			1
he said : ‘ i think the artisan who exists in @entity58 does n’t exist in this country			0
‘ now anybody who loses their job buys a @entity63 with lots of chrome and is suddenly a plumber			0
‘ the truth of the matter is that the country is teeming with bodgers because nobody gets trained			0
‘ the old apprenticeships have gone and people think , “ i think i ’ll do a bit of plastering and bricklaying ”			0
so nobody is actually trained			0
lack of incentive : mr @entity11 said that the old apprenticeships have gone - leaving bricklayers and builders without proper training ‘ the artisan class in @entity58 still exists			2
i do n’t think that in @entity49 , @entity82 or @entity83 they have programmes called @entity85 and @entity86 where you call in plumbers and builders and they just rip you off			0
‘ it ’s a bit of a @entity16 tragedy , and i do n’t think it exists in other countries where trade is a good thing			2
’ the comments come days after the government ’s @entity97 warned that too many school - leavers lack even the basic abilities to ‘ look people in the eye and get out of bed ’			0
the immigration panel claimed @entity16 students are given little incentive to work by the benefits system			1
as a result , businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified , more reliable , confident and – unlike their native competitors – have the good manners needed to deal with customers			0
mr @entity11 said @entity123 migrants ‘ have the guts , the energy , the initiative and are prepared to slog it out in another country in a different language ... inevitably , they are going to be more driven ’			1
he added : ‘ the fact that they slammed their front door in @entity127 and hacked their way across @entity58 to a foreign country shows that these are people with initiative , drive and ambition			2
’ he will appear in the @entity135 show @entity11 and @entity12 : too many immigrants ? , which pairs @entity16 - born citizens with five @entity140 - based immigrants from all over the world to explore their impact on @entity16 .			2

failure to teach youngsters a trade forces companies to hire foreign workers
mr @entity11 and miss @entity22 also claim young @entity150 adults are too entitled
he said migrants working in @entity16 have ' the guts , the energy , the initiative '
government panel claimed benefits give students little incentive to work
