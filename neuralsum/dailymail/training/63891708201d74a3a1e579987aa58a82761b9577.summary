when @entity1 started breeding parrots at his home , he did n’t expect a squawk of protest from his neighbours			1
his rural property was a noisy pig farm until recently , and there are other farms in the area			0
but his hobby has split the village – with angry neighbours complaining of sleepless nights and stress			2
now mr @entity1 ’s critics appear to have won the battle to have the birds removed , after the local council ruled he had to rehome all of them within six months			1
two exotic blue and yellow macaws which are similar to the parrots being bred at @entity1 's home the 76 - year - old insists he only has around 200 parrots , but neighbours have claimed he in fact keeps up to 500			1
some villagers are overjoyed by the ruling , while others simply can not understand what all the fuss is about			0
@entity34 , 47 , who lives four doors away and has been leading the campaign against the exotic birds , said the decision was an ‘ enormous relief ’			2
‘ the parrots , some of them macaws , emit what can only be described as alarming , primeval squawks at random intervals , sometimes for several hours , ’ she said			2
‘ every member of my family and most of our neighbours have suffered directly because of mr @entity1 ’s hobby			1
we have gone to work exhausted and i have sent my children to school tired			0
’ @entity54 said the noise sometimes begins as early as 5am			1
one claimed to have been so stressed by the racket that they took six months off work			0
but church pastor @entity60 and his wife @entity61 , who live opposite , said they were not bothered at all by the birds			0
mr @entity1 's home , from where hundreds of parrots will have to be rehomed following a council order @entity68 , a public notice shows mr @entity1 's application to change the use of his agricultural buildings in order to house the birds , while right , a barn on the property shows where they are kept ‘ when i wake up early in the morning the noise of the pigeons is more of a nuisance , ’ said mr @entity60 , who is in his 50s			1
‘ there were pigs in the outbuildings before the farmer who lived there retired			0
‘ i am quite happy for the parrots to remain			0
sometimes when they are being fed they make a bit of a noise but they are certainly not a problem to us			0
’ matters came to a head on wednesday when @entity96 considered retrospective planning permission that mr @entity1 , a widowed former game farmer , was told to submit following complaints			1
his application to change the use of his agricultural buildings was turned down			1
mr @entity1 ’s daughter , @entity101 , attended the meeting and said her father had built a 10ft - high , 4ft - deep straw bale wall in 2013 to dampen the noise			2
but @entity106 , @entity107 chairman , said members felt mr @entity1 had not gone through the proper procedures before acquiring so many parrots			1
he added : ‘ it was not just a few birds			0
there were far more than someone would normally have as pets			0
