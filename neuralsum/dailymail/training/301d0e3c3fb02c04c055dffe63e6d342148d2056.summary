@entity0 heads into the @entity3 title - deciding showdown in @entity4 later this month conceding to being in a far from comfortable position			1
it will be the third time in @entity0 's @entity3 career he will have faced a last - race decider , having done so previously in his rookie year in 2007 , and again in his title - winning campaign of 2008			1
they were both nerve - jangling affairs for @entity0 as in each he went into the final grand prix with a lead over his rivals			2
@entity0 heads into the final race in @entity4 with all to play for in the drivers ' championships with double points at stake the title will be won by either @entity22 ' @entity0 or teammate @entity23 1			1
@entity28 157 in 2007 an early technical issue in the race in @entity31 resulted in @entity0 missing out on the championship by a point to @entity34 who was then in his first spell with @entity36			1
a year later only a dramatic overtake in the final corner of the last lap gave @entity0 the minimum fifth place he required to snatch the title from @entity43 's grasp as the @entity31 had already crossed the line ahead of him as the race victor			1
six years on and @entity0 heads into this season 's denouement , where the controversial double - points system comes into play , with a 17 - point cushion over @entity22 team - mate @entity23			1
@entity0 knows a top - two finish will guarantee him his second title , but it is the unknown and unpredictability of @entity3 that means he can not rest			2
' there is zero comfort going into the last race , ' said @entity0			0
@entity0 was pipped at the post by @entity36 's @entity34 in the final race in @entity31 , 2007 @entity0 won his first and only driver 's championship on the last day of the season in 2008 ' there are 50 points to gain , which has never happened in @entity3 before , and it just so happens to be this season			1
' in the last race you never know what is going to happen , so i 'm going into it to win			0
' @entity0 's positive mindset means he is refusing to contemplate for a moment the possibility he may not be crowned champion			0
' why would i think that ? it 's not the way to approach any race weekend , ' insisted @entity0			0
in sunday 's race in @entity31 , however , @entity0 underlined mistakes can happen at any time as he appeared poised to take the lead - which potentially would have resulted in the win - only to spin off the @entity83 circuit			2
that handed the advantage back to @entity23 , with @entity0 coming home second to bring the curtain down on his five - race winning streak			2
a mistake cost @entity0 at the @entity31 @entity91 where teammate closed the gap to 17 points the @entity96 driver is hoping to be spraying champagne from the winner 's podium after the season finale again , though , @entity0 is not going to let that haunt him , adding : ' ultimately it was a mistake , but i 'm not going to look back at it			1
' it 's done and dusted			0
i 'm not going to have any regrets			0
' i was just pushing to win , same as every race			0
i do n't think i took any unnecessary risks			0
' there are still plenty of positives to take from the day			0

@entity3 championship will be decided at @entity114
@entity23 closed gap on @entity0 to 17 points after win in @entity31
@entity22 driver remains positive ahead of title deciding final race where double points are on offer
