the @entity0 of 1964 introduced 51 million visitors to a range of technological innovations and predictions during its run			1
fifty years later , some of those ideas have turned out to be commonplace in our world , such as video phone calls and asking computers for information			1
but some of them - colonies on the moon and jet packs as a mode of everyday transportation - remain firmly on the drawing board			2
designed by @entity45 , it showcased it included scenes of colonies on the moon as well as in @entity38 , huge underwater dwellings , moving sidewalks , computer - guided cars zipping along congestion - free highways and a machine that used a laser to cut through rainforests , leaving behind paved roads			2
the vision even had undersea vacationing with holidaymakers taking a break at @entity60 deep in the sea			2
it also had jet packs , demonstrated by men who wore them and zoomed around the grounds , but which remain a mode of transport found primarily in science fiction			0
the exhibit , which visitors rode through on a ride train , proved to be the most popular exhibit at the @entity29 - waiting lines were often at least two hours long			1
for the men who lived on the moon ? also on the @entity26 ride at the 1964 @entity29 was this prediction of what a lunar colony might look like for more archive footage like the video above click here what they had right @entity87 at the @entity90 pavilion , engineers touted a ' picturephone ' that allowed callers to see who they were talking to , a concept that lives on in modern - day apps such as @entity96 and @entity97			1
at the time , though , picture phones did n't take off , said @entity99 , history professor at the @entity100			0
she attributed that to high setup costs that made them accessible to relatively few			0
and at a time when many men attended the fair in coat and tie and women in dresses , people were n't quite ready to be seen on the phone at any hour , in their pajamas or worse			0
' we were still a little more of a formal society , ' @entity99 said			0
touch - tone phones other new @entity90 technologies included the touch tone phones as opposed the traditional rotary dial			0
known as the ' push button ' originally introduced at the @entity122 in 1962 , this was still the first time many visitors were exposed to this technology			1
talking face - to - face : a @entity87 is demonstrated at the @entity126 at the @entity0 personal use of the computer the fair also gave wide exposure to the power of computers , which at the time were seen as huge cabinets of blinking lights and electrodes operated by big corporations			1
at the @entity140 pavilion , visitors saw a computer system in which a machine took in a card with a date written on it and gave back another card with a news story from that date			1
at the @entity150 pavilion , a computer would answer scientific questions or give out recipes from a cookbook			0
' i do n't think it 's a stretch to say in a lot of ways this fair was key to familiarising people with and really normalizing the concept of working with computers , ' said @entity162 , a @entity163 filmmaker who 's making a documentary about the fair			0
capturing imaginations : visitors at the it 's a @entity168 attraction at the @entity0 small scale , big future : @entity171 is seen presenting a model of @entity171 's it 's a @entity168 attraction from the 1964 @entity0 robotics another bit of technology ( along with an annoyingly hard - to - forget song ) was introduced by @entity171 with the it 's a @entity168 attraction : robotic animation			1
that ' animatronic ' exhibit and three others , including one featuring a robotic president @entity182 , showed characters moving in lifelike ways , including smiling and blinking			0
' this is the first time that millions of people had the opportunity to see something that could be described as robotic			0
the special effects you could see in the @entity29 blew away what you could see in the movies , ' said @entity194 , author of a book about the fair			0
regardless of whether such notions survived , observers say the fair offered a vision of the world 's potential that made it seem like anything was possible			1
' it really seems like 50 years ago , we had more exciting visions for 50 years in the future than we do now , ' mr @entity162 said			1
@entity209 the two - seater sports car with its long hood and short rear deck was officially unveiled by @entity213 , head of the @entity209 division , at the @entity29 , just four days before the april 17 public introduction			0
