it has become one of @entity3 's surprising second acts - how 62 - year - old @entity4 became one of @entity3 's most bankable action heroes playing a cold blooded killer with a particular set of skills			1
but now the @entity11 - born actor and star of the ultra-violent taken trilogy has thought it wise to wade into @entity16 's fraught gun debate			2
speaking at a press conference in @entity18 for the launch of @entity20 on tuesday , @entity4 offered an interviewer his opinion of his adopted home 's attitude to firearms			1
' there 's just too many [ expletive ] guns out there , ' said @entity4 , who is reputed to have been paid $ 20 million for the new latest taken installment			1
i think the population is like , 320 million ? there 's over 300 million guns			0
privately owned , in @entity16			0
' i think it 's a [ expletive ] disgrace			0
every week now we 're picking up a newspaper and seeing , ' yet another few kids have been killed in schools			0
' scroll down for @entity39 the gun - totting star of the ' taken ' trilogy , @entity4 , has condemned the level of gun ownership in @entity16 labelling it an ' ( expletive ) disgrace ' while offering his condolences over the @entity47 terrorist attacks ; above @entity4 , as @entity48 , in @entity20 sleeper hit : taken , which was penned by @entity51 , followed the simple story of a former @entity54 operative whose daughter is kidnapped			1
@entity4 's character then kills a lot of people and rescues her action hero : @entity4 starred in a 2010 remake of the 1980s classic saturday serial @entity62 - where he played the commander of a framed special forces ops team @entity4 was quick to draw a line between guns in movies , and real life saying ' it 's fantasy ' and says movies like taken 3 do n't inspire people to buy guns taken again : in the sequel to taken , called taken 2 , @entity4 used his particular set of skills to rescue his wife and shoot a lot of bad guys again when asked if the issue extends to police responsibility @entity4 said ' let 's not get into it '			1
but then added : ' let 's put it this way : i think a light has been shone on the justice system in @entity16 , and it 's a justifiable light			0
' @entity4 , a supporter of gun control , is best known as gun - toting father , @entity48 , who will stop at nothing to get his loved ones back			1
but he was quick to make the distinction between fiction and reality , and said his movies would n't inspire people to buy and use guns			0
growing up watching cowboy movies had not turned him into a killer , he said			0
' a character like @entity48 going out with guns and taking revenge : it 's fantasy			1
it 's in the movies , you know ? i think it can give people a great release from stresses in life and all the rest of it , you know what i mean ? it does n't mean they 're all going to go out and go , ' yeah , let 's get a gun ! ' runaway success : @entity4 has starred in three taken movies since the release of the first film in the franchise in 2008 and each of the posters for the movies showed the actor sporting a gun biggest hit to date in the series : the latest taken movie has grossed almost $ 40 million in its opening weekend and deposed the last @entity137 movie from the number 1 spot in the @entity16 box office the @entity11 - born actor became an @entity16 citizen five years ago and currently lives in @entity142			1
before speaking about gun ownership in @entity16 , @entity4 reflected on @entity144 and @entity145 shooting spree last wednesday that claimed a dozen lives			2
he said : ' first off , my thoughts and prayers and my heart are with the deceased , and certainly with all of @entity153			2
' i 've got a lot of dear friends in @entity47			0
' the wildly successful taken trilogy has grossed almost $ 603 million to date in box office worldwide			1
since 2005 , and @entity158 , @entity4 has launched his lucrative second career as an action hero			0
change of career : no more historical dramas for 60 something action hero @entity4 in a little under a decade , the @entity11 - born actor has starred in 10 action films , having previously starred in character driven roles			2
but from the box - office takings , it is clear that @entity4 's career switch has paid - off , and handsomely			1
@entity170 of @entity4 's 15 highest - grossing movies in the @entity16 are action films and of those dozen , only three were released before 2005			1
indeed , studio bosses have been keen to utilize the actors bankability through his new - found action hero status			0
in the @entity16 , the average profit per @entity4 action movie is $ 181 million , while his non-action offerings rake in $ 4 million			2
that puts him up with stars such as @entity180 and @entity181 , who make anywhere between $ 100 million and $ 300 million per film			2
and of course , this new found stardom has boosted @entity4 's net worth			0
he was reportedly paid $ 1 million for @entity185 , $ 15 million for @entity186 and $ 20 million for @entity20 - seeing his bank balance shoot up to $ 75 million			1
( source : @entity189 ) it has turned @entity4 from a respected character actor most famous for his portrayal of @entity193 in @entity195 's @entity194 winning @entity196 into a fully fledged action hero			2
the star is reported to have been paid $ 20 million for his role as @entity54 operative @entity48 , joining the ranks of @entity181 and @entity201 as @entity3 's best paid stars			1
however , some of course are not happy with @entity4 's foray into @entity207 politics			0
' the rank hypocrisy of an actor who uses guns in his films and attacks gun ownership at the same time is way over the top			0
i guess you do n't need brains to act , ' said @entity219 , founder of the @entity220 to @entity221			0
' all you have to do is read the script			0
' historical roles : the superstar is seen toting a gun in @entity226 ( 2014 , left ) and in 1995 's more traditional career move @entity228 ( right ) @entity4 said his ' thoughts and prayers and my heart ' is with the victims of the @entity235 massacre			1
