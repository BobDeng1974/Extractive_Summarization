they have quickly become one of the world 's most feared and notorious militant groups after carrying out a series of atrocities while leading a murderous rampage across parts of @entity8 and @entity9			1
yet , while western powers face growing pressure to step up military action against @entity14 militants , not much appears to be known publicly about its leadership , structure or even its size			1
a number of names however have emerged of suspected leaders of the militant group , who are believed to have directed the group as it has taken control of parts of northern @entity8 and @entity9			1
it was only last month that the first image was seen in years of @entity28 leader @entity27 , after he walked out of the shadows to deliver a sermon at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity8 's second largest city despite the group 's notoriety across the globe following its formation last year , its workings and structure has been difficult to pin down			1
it was only last month that the first image was seen in years of its leader @entity27 , after he walked out of the shadows to deliver a sermon at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity8 's second largest city			2
he addressed the packed congregation – which included @entity28 fighters and local sympathisers – on the first friday of the @entity47 holy month of @entity48 , in the heart of the city his fighters took control of barely a month previously			1
his sermon came only days after he declared himself caliph , or ruler , of the world ’s 1.2 billion @entity47			2
he also declared large swathes of northern @entity9 and @entity8 seized by his fighters as his new caliphate			2
@entity60 is understood to rule the group through a hit squad ready to assassinate subordinates who appear disorderly , along with a religious authority , according to a report by @entity66 in the @entity67			2
the report suggests the group is ruled by a shura council who divide responsibilities for specific areas among certain ministers			2
@entity74 has been identified as one of the group 's most prominent commanders and may even have risen to become its overall military chief , it has been claimed a smaller military council is also said to exist , according to the report , below which are more officials with special responsibilities or expertise			2
@entity84 , a former director of intelligence at the @entity86 who now works for @entity90 think - tank @entity88 , told the @entity67 that members of the group had ' learnt ' since the insurgency in @entity8 in 2006			2
he said : ' they have far more dispersed authority			2
they make sure they have two commanders on the scene at all times ; they have a lack of a centralised control			0
leaders set policy but they do n’t attempt to plan every operation one by one			1
' last week , another of the group 's leaders was named in a resolution adopted by the @entity110 that sought to weaken militants in the region by cutting off the flow of foreign fighters and its financing capabilities the resolution named six fighters accused of funnelling funds and helping foreign fighters travel to the frontline , including @entity14 spokesman @entity119			1
in june , @entity119 apparently appeared in a video which featured extremists urging followers to ' march to @entity125 - we have a score to settle ' , as @entity28 fighters made their way across northern @entity8			1
despite the group 's notoriety across the globe following its formation last year , its workings and structure has been difficult to pin down a voice said to be that of @entity119 is heard in the video saying : ' continue your march as the battle is not yet raging			1
' it will rage in @entity125 and @entity143			0
so be ready for it			0
put on your belts and get ready			0
' elsewhere , @entity74 has been identified as one of the group 's most prominent commanders and may even have risen to become its overall military chief , it has been claimed			0

@entity159 has been the group 's military commander in @entity9 , leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the @entity8 border			0
but he may have risen to become the group 's overall military chief , a post that has been vacant after the @entity8 militant who once held it - known as @entity170 - was killed in the @entity8 city of @entity32 in early june			0
@entity14 militants embrace in celebration after taking over @entity175 air base near @entity171 on sunday in a video released by the group early in july , @entity74 is shown standing next to the group 's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between @entity8 and @entity9			1
the video identified @entity74 as ' the military commander ' without specifying its @entity9 branch , suggesting he had been elevated to overall commander			0
the group however has not formally announced such a promotion			0
another senior commander who appears to have few qualms over showing his face is @entity191 , also known as @entity192 , understood to be one of the group 's regional commanders			1
@entity196 , whose real name was @entity198 , was believed to have been the group 's head military commander and security chief before he was killed in january , according to the @entity67			0
images which appear to be of a number of the group 's leaders have been posted online , including on social media sites , but are difficult to verify			1

' grave , horrific human rights violations are being committed daily by @entity28 and associated armed groups , ' @entity213 said			1
' they are systematically targeting men , women and children based on their ethnic , religious or sectarian affiliation and are ruthlessly carrying out widespread ethnic and religious cleansing in the areas under their control			0
