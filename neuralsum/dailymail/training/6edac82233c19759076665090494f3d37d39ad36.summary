by @entity0 do you hate the thought of ever being parted from your beloved dog ? you may never have to thanks to a @entity6 competition organised in @entity7 that will clone your dog for free			1
the winner of the contest will be flown to @entity11 in @entity7 to watch the process as part of a @entity15 documentary to be aired next year			1
imagine never having to say goodbye to your pet dog			2
that is what is in store for one lucky @entity6 dog owner as a team of top scientists from @entity11 , @entity7 , are offering a once in a lifetime opportunity to clone ' man 's best friend ' for free taking just one microscopic skin cell , the team from @entity26 claim they can recreate an exact clone of a dog canine in just two months			1
dr @entity30 , the chief technical officer at @entity26 , pioneered the technique in 2005			1
his group is currently the only company in the world that offers dog cloning commercially			1
he has now successfully cloned at least 400 dogs - thought to be one of the most difficult animals to clone			1
taking just one microscopic skin cell , the team from @entity26 claim they can recreate an exact clone of a dog canine in just two months the process involves obtaining live cells from a living dog or a dog five days after it has died			1
dogs that have similar ovulation time are selected as egg donors and surrogate mothers			2
eggs are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ‘ flushing ’ and the nuclei of the eggs , which contain dna of the egg donor , is removed			0
then donor cell is then injected into the enucleated egg and the two cells are ‘ fused ’ together			0
this fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog			1
the whole process takes less than a day but comes with a hefty price tag , at around $ 100,000 or £ 63,000 to clone one dog			1
@entity26 has cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the @entity7 government , as well as a number of highly prized pets in the @entity70			1
but the cloning of animals has been a source of controversy since the technique was pioneered in @entity77 in 1996 with the birth of @entity79 the sheep , the first mammal to be cloned			2
@entity81 , the author of ' @entity82 ' , a book about the dog cloning industry , says that the practice is centred in @entity7 because there are much lower ethical standards for the treatment of dogs than in @entity90 and the @entity70			1
' you can rent [ dogs ] from farmers for the laboratory and , hopefully , everything goes ok , return them to the farmer , but everything 's not going to go ok			0
' the author says that some of the dogs used in the cloning process as egg donors or surrogate mothers are later sent back to the farms where they are killed and eaten			2

dr @entity30 , who is also the director of the @entity6 @entity136 said : ‘ we can clone any breed , size or shape of canine and are coming to the @entity6 to offer this process to the owner of one very special dog			1
‘ we welcome entries from any @entity6 - based dog owner who wants to benefit from this exciting new advance in biotechnology			2
’ @entity150 @entity149 , who paid an incredible $ 50,000 for the procedure using pet @entity153 's dna last year , will also feature on the show			0
pictured here is her cloned pup ' @entity157 ' ms @entity149 said : ' i really can see no difference between them			0
so many of their gestures and the way they play is identical ' the whole process will be filmed for a documentary by @entity166 to be screened on @entity15 next year			1
@entity150 @entity149 , who paid an incredible $ 50,000 for the procedure using pet @entity153 's dna last year , will also feature on the show			0
ms @entity149 had been so upset by the death of her constant companion four years ago that she shelled out the massive fee so that she could have an identical replacement			0
she said : ' he was like the child i never had - and i probably did treat him better than most people treat their children			0
' ms @entity149 , who named the new pup @entity157 , added : ‘ i really can see no difference between them			0
so many of their gestures and the way they play is identical			0
' applications to this unique competition are open now and close on 25th november 2013 .			0

@entity26 in @entity7 usually charges £ 63,000 to clone a dog
group has cloned 400 dogs - a process *criticised* by some as *unethical*
the winner of the competition will be featured on @entity15 next year
dog owners *interested* in having their dog cloned should contact *dogcloninguk@sooam.org* or @entity200
