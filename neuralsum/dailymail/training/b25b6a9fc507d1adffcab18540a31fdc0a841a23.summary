by @entity0 published : 01:51 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 23 may 2013 @entity1 has won £ 58,000 in damages after winning a legal fight against @entity4 a former jockey has won £ 58,000 in compensation after winning a legal fight against racecourse managers following a fall which left him with a head injury and fractured pelvis			2
the @entity13 upheld @entity1 's claim against managers of @entity4			2
mr @entity1 - who is now a trainer - had fallen from his horse @entity17 at the first hurdle at @entity4 , @entity20 , in november 2006 and hit a post supporting a guard rail running around the perimeter of the steeplechase course , judges heard			1
he had claimed damages and argued the hurdle was too close to the perimeter fence and insufficiently padded			1
mr @entity1 suggested that regulations governing work equipment had been breached			1
course bosses contested his claim and a judge ruled against him following a trial at @entity34 in june 2012 concluding that the hurdle and guard rail were ' suitable equipment '			2
but three appeal judges have allowed an appeal by mr @entity1 following a hearing in @entity41			1
judges said liability had been disputed but damages had been agreed at £ 58,000			0
and they said mr @entity1 had made a full recovery			1
lord @entity46 , who heard mr @entity1 's appeal with @entity48 and @entity49 , said jump racing was ' dangerous ' and @entity4 prided itself on its ' attention to safety considerations '			1
the judge said the accident had occurred in a ' most unusual way ' , when the horse skidded sharply after falling at the outer end of a hurdle			0
but he said what mattered was the ' reasonable foreseeability of a collision between horse or rider with the railings ' upright at this place '			0
lord @entity46 said the judge at the county court trial had been concerned about the ' implications of a conclusion in favour of mr @entity1 '			2
' he was concerned about " the relentless logic of the personal injury lawyer " , as he put it , ' said @entity75			0
mr @entity1 fell from his horse @entity17 at the first hurdle at @entity4 ' were jump races to be required to be made so undemanding that all horses could be expected to negotiate them without mishap ? ' how were the requirements of the regulations to apply , for example , to @entity85 at @entity86 ? ' these are understandable concerns			1
' but @entity75 added : ' of course the hazards of jump and hurdle racing may lawfully remain : jumps and hurdles may properly and lawfully continue to pose challenges of varying difficulty			0
' he said adjustments to the layout or construction of hurdles and railings mooted in the @entity1 case did not affect the " integrity and ethos " of jump racing			0
' what was fundamentally at issue here was not the suitability of this hurdle , taken on its own , or the suitability of the railings ' upright , taken on its own , " added @entity75			0
' it was a combination of matters : the location of this particular hurdle so close to this railings ' upright ( with its particular construction ) that gave rise to the problem			0

@entity1 fell from his horse @entity17 at the first hurdle in 2006
he argued the hurdle was too close to the perimeter fence and that work equipment regulations had been breached
mr @entity1 has made a full recovery and is now a trainer
