an advocacy group for the disabled says a federal judge is giving the surf - inspired clothing label , which has more than 500 locations worldwide , until january 1 , 2017 , to make the changes			1
many of its stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch and a lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the company of discriminating against disabled customers			1
problematic : in august @entity11 was found guilty of disability discrimination with its stepped store entrances , modeled after @entity29 beach shacks ( a store front in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ) the @entity34 says a ruling friday by a federal judge in @entity37 requires @entity11 to make changes at a rate of 77 stores per year so they are more accessible			1
the ruling says the company has options including leveling out stairs at entrances or installing ramps			1
it also can close off stairway entrances so that all customers , not just those who ca n't walk , would use secondary entrances			1
the lawsuit was filed in 2009 against @entity51 and its owner , @entity53 - based @entity2 , on behalf of several @entity33 customers			1
last month a federal judge ruled that @entity56 s surf - inspired clothing label @entity11 has until january 1 , 2017 , to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair - friendly in march the district court for @entity33 ordered company executives to comply with disability advocates but according to the @entity63 the two parties failed to reach an agreement and the steps remained a problem			1
the long - running case originally grew from complaints filed against two @entity11 stores in @entity33 by the @entity34			1
@entity70 , 45 , one of the plaintiffs in the four - year dispute , said she visited the @entity74 store , which has since closed , to buy items for her 12 - year - old daughter but her wheelchair could n’t make it up the steps			2
' @entity11 markets beauty as a stereotype , the reality is they still need the rest of us ' lawyers for the @entity87 , a national civil - rights organization , found similar access problems at @entity2 and @entity11 stores in nine @entity90 and filed a similar lawsuit in november 2009 in @entity92			1
in 2012 the @entity33 - focused case grew into a class - action suit targeting the 248 @entity11 stores across the @entity96 that feature imitation porch steps as a main entrance			1
despite the uproar , @entity11 vigorously defended the use of stairs in its stores			2
a company spokesman said that the raised entrances were designed to create ' an entry to a house in @entity29 that you would walk up onto the porch or walk down into the porch , to enter , like you would do at a beach house			1
' widespread : 248 hollister stores across the @entity96 currently feature faux porch steps as their main entrance the firm argued that it complies with the law because the stores include side doors disguised as shuttered windows that are wheelchair accessible			1
however plaintiffs said these doors are often are blocked with tables stacked with merchandise and they should not be made to enter through an ' inferior ' entrance			2
ms @entity70 , who was born without a sacrum - the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine - told the @entity63 : ' i would never go through a side door			0
it ’s not something i would do			0
i ’m philosophically opposed to that			0
' these stores are designed to look shuttered and hidden , as if to keep out the riffraff ' ' these stores are designed to look shuttered and hidden , as if to keep out the riffraff			0
i want people to know that , as a society , we have evolved over the past 25 years			0
' despite the fact that [ @entity11 ] market [ s ] beauty and athleticism as a stereotype , the reality is they still need the rest of us people who are short , chubby and maybe with acne and wheelchairs			0
' in march @entity96 district judge @entity152 agreed that @entity11 ’s inaccessible porches violate the @entity96 with @entity154 , also known as the @entity155			0
the 23 - year - old law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment , transportation , public accommodation , communications , and governmental activities			0
judge @entity152 ruled that customers who use wheelchairs must be entitled to the same experience as all other customers			2
image conscious : @entity11 , like all of the @entity2 brands , markets its clothing as a lifestyle , its main inspiration being @entity29 's beach and surf scene he suggested that @entity11 could flatten out its entrance ways and remove the steps or install wheelchair - accessible ramps			1
commenting on the ruling , a spokesman for @entity11 told @entity184 ' we are surprised by the judge ’s decision that the @entity11 entrances are not compliant with the @entity155			0
' we ’ve maintained throughout the litigation , and continue to maintain , that the stores comply with the @entity155 and allow access to all patrons			0
' we want all of our customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores ' ' beyond that , we want all of our customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores			2
while we reserve the right to appeal the underlying legal issue , we are currently working with the court and the plaintiffs to reach a mutually agreeable resolution			0
' @entity11 , like all of the @entity2 brands , markets its clothing as a lifestyle , its main inspiration being @entity29 's beach and surf scene			2
the website explains that it is the ' coolest destination for genuine @entity29 style clothes for guys and girls			0
' and a 2013 report to shareholders reads : ' it ’s all about hot lifeguards and beautiful beaches … young and fun , with a sense of humor , @entity11 never takes itself too seriously			0
@entity11 ’s laid - back lifestyle and @entity225 image is timeless and effortlessly cool			0
' the @entity226 has also weighed in on the discrimination case			0
it highlighted that the @entity11 stores were built long after the @entity155 came into play and therefore the entrances violate both the ' spirit and letter of the law			2
