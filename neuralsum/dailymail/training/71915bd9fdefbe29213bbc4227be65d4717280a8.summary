challenging : justice @entity0 was asked by a student about his opposition to gay marriage a gay college student questioned conservative @entity6 justice @entity0 about a previous ruling where he wrote in favor of anti-sodomy laws			1
in that landmark 2003 case , which ended up overturning anti-sodomy laws in @entity13 and 13 other states , @entity0 voted against the majority , writing that moral objections to sodomy should be considered as valid as moral objections to bestiality and murder			1
in monday 's lecture at @entity23 , the 78 - year - old judge said his method of argument was ' effective '			1
the comments now have many liberal campaigners worried as the @entity6 is scheduled to hear two cases on same - sex marriage in the coming year , and his comments show that it is reasonable to expect a dissent from @entity0			1
' i do n't think it 's necessary , but i think it 's effective , ' @entity0 said , adding that legislative bodies can ban what they believe to be immoral			2
@entity0 has been giving speeches around the country to promote his new book , ' @entity41 , ' and his lecture at @entity23 comes just days after the court agreed to take on two cases that challenge the federal @entity45 , which defines marriage as between a man and a woman			1
some in the audience who had come to hear @entity0 speak about his book applauded but more of those who attended the lecture clapped at freshman @entity54 's question			2
scholarly : the lecture took place at @entity23 , a place that freshman @entity54 says he ' loves ' instigator : @entity54 , who identified himself as gay and said on his @entity62 page that he voted for @entity63 in the recent election , said that he was not convinced by @entity0 's reasoning ' it 's a form of argument that i thought you would have known , which is called the ` reduction to the absurd , '' @entity0 told @entity54 of @entity71 during the question - and - answer period			1
' if we can not have moral feelings against homosexuality , can we have it against murder ? can we have it against other things ? ' he said according to the school 's paper , @entity80			1
@entity0 said he is not equating sodomy with murder but drawing a parallel between the bans on both			2
then he deadpanned : ' i 'm surprised you are n't persuaded			2
' @entity54 said afterward that he was not persuaded by @entity0 's answer			0
he said he believes @entity0 's writings tend to ' dehumanize ' gays			0
as @entity0 often does in public speaking , he cracked wise , taking aim mostly at those who view the @entity95 as a ' living document ' that changes with the times			0
' it is n't a living document , ' @entity0 said			0
' it 's dead , dead , dead , dead			0
' hot topic : the issue of gay marriage is expected to be an upcoming consideration of the @entity6 he said that people who see the @entity95 as changing often argue they are taking the more flexible approach			1
but their true goal is to set policy permanently , he said			0
' my constitution is a very flexible one , ' he said			0
' there 's nothing in there about abortion			0
it 's up to the citizens ... the same with the death penalty			0
' @entity0 said that interpreting laws requires adherence to the words used and to their meanings at the time they were written .			2

student questioned conservative justice about a 2003 *decision* where he wrote in favor of anti-sodomy laws
in that case , he said that moral objections to sodomy should be considered as valid as moral objections to bestiality and murder
said at lecture that his method of argument was ' effective '
' if we can not have moral feelings against homosexuality , can we have it against murder ? can we have it against other things ? '
