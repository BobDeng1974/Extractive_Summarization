boss @entity0 would welcome a @entity3 takeover , but admits he is facing deja vu			1
the @entity3 drew 2 - 2 at @entity5 on saturday , having led 2 - 0 , after reports linking @entity8 billionaire @entity7 with the club emerged			1
@entity7 is worth more than Â£ 1.25billion , according to the @entity11 guide , and owns @entity13 franchise the @entity14 and @entity16 side the @entity17			2
@entity0 was in charge at @entity19 and @entity20 when they were sold , and knows the feeling after @entity3 were linked with a takeover			1
@entity3 manager @entity0 was at @entity19 and @entity20 when they were taken over ' yes , because it 's happened many times , ' he said			1
' at @entity19 it happened , at @entity20 there was a takeover and now @entity3			1
' but it is difficult for managers now			0
every club would love a billionaire			2
there are not that many about - you have to snap their hand off			0
' it must be lovely , but it brings a different kind of pressure , to be able to spend millions and get top players			0
' it must be brilliant for any manager to spend millions and get to work with players like ( @entity50 's @entity49 ) @entity48			0
@entity8 investor @entity7 is in talks with @entity3 about purchasing the @entity54 club @entity0 was @entity20 manager when @entity56 took over the club ' i do n't really know what a billionaire could do for @entity3 - i have only been here six weeks			1
you 'd better ask the chairman			0
there are not a lot of billionaires in @entity65			0
' @entity3 were 2 - 0 up at the break at @entity67 after @entity69 's opener and @entity71 's penalty			1
@entity72 made it 2 - 1 in the second half after @entity74 barged into @entity75 , leaving @entity0 baffled as to why referee @entity77 did not award a foul			1
it forced the goalkeeper off with a head injury and @entity77 also failed to give @entity3 another first - half penalty when @entity74 felled @entity83			1
@entity3 went ahead through @entity69 and then @entity71 put them 2 - 0 up but @entity5 pegged them back @entity87 's stoppage - time spot - kick salvaged a point for the @entity5 and denied the @entity3 a third win of the season			1
' i wanted to see the referee and i was told he was going to stay , but he did n't , ' @entity0 said			2
' i saw ( fourth official ) @entity93 and the others , but i am afraid @entity77 had gone			0
' that was old - fashioned stuff , the smash on @entity75			0
the smash on ( @entity100 ) @entity99 by ( @entity102 ) @entity101 ( in the build - up to @entity5 's penalty ) could easily have been a free - kick			2
' he added : ' i came along to @entity3 to help them out really			2
they had lost their manager at a difficult stage of the season , so it has been nice to steady the ship			0
' we have a good group of players here			0
