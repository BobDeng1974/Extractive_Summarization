@entity6 , a former key executive in @entity8 - based private equity company @entity7 , was told by mr @entity9 at the @entity10 of @entity11 's @entity10 today : ' i am not sure you and i are on the same planet '			1
mr @entity6 , 47 , was explaining to the judge why he was arguing in court that his estranged wife was only entitled to £ 5m despite the fact he has a huge fortune of at least £ 150m			1
@entity19 ( left ) , and her estranged husband @entity6 ( right ) , outside the @entity10 in @entity11 today			1
the judge in their divorce case said he did not feel he and mr @entity6 were ' on the same planet ' the tycoon said that ' unfortunately ' the mother of his two teenage children , @entity19 , 45 , had failed to abide by a @entity28 post-nuptial agreement			1
she was therefore prevented from receiving a more substantial sum , or anything other than the £ 5m deemed to be her own separate property , an amount expected to fall to just over £ 3m when bills are paid			0
justice @entity9 told the couple there was ' plenty of money to go around and it ' should be so easy ' from the opening of the case @entity9 urged the couple - who had ' married without a bean ' - to settle their differences			0
the judge told them as they sat on opposite sides of the courtroom there was ' plenty of money to go round ' , there were no difficulties and it ' should be so easy '			0
he added : ' people who are struggling to afford two - bedroom houses have difficulties			0
' the couple began living together in 1992 and married in 1995 in @entity59			0
they separated in 2013 and have two children , now aged 15 and 12			0
the court was told that @entity6 was ' the breadwinner ' and @entity19 ' the homemaker '			1
in 1997 he was offered a job with @entity7 in @entity66 , @entity8 , and soon after he was offered a post in @entity68 , where they lived from 1998 until 2005			2
the couple moved to the @entity71 in 2008 and their matrimonial home has been in @entity11 ever since			2
after the marriage broke down @entity19 moved to a flat in @entity76			2

@entity19 , 45 , arrives back at the @entity84 building following lunch , with her lawyer @entity86 ( right )			2
she is taking on her estranged husband @entity6 in a bitter battle over his fortune mr @entity6 told the judge that @entity19 had been ' a good wife ' over 20 years and ' a good mother ' and would have been entitled to at least $ 70m ( £ 45m ) , the ' total sum payable ' under the post-nup agreement they had signed in october 2000			1
but he argued ms @entity19 was not entitled to any of his money , or any of his property , after coming to court to seek a better settlement			1
ms @entity19 argued when she gave evidence that @entity99 of the addendum agreement gave her ' the unfettered right ' to seek from the court ' any form of financial provision the court has power to order '			1
he made his fortune with a @entity8 private equity company she argued the family wealth was generated during the marriage and there should now be an equal division of the current total net assets			2
the judge told @entity116 , appearing for mr work that he was ' really concerned ' about the husband 's ' open ' position that he was ' not going to pay her a penny '			0
the judge expressed his disbelief that ' a wife of roughly 20 years , married when neither had a bean , and he is now worth at least £ 150m , should be expected to go away with just over £ 3m '			1
he added : ' at the moment i am not sure mr @entity6 and i are on the same planet			0
' mr @entity127 did not disagree that that was mr @entity6 's position in court , but he suggested to the judge that he was ' trespassing into negotiations ' that might be taking place out of court			2
the judge replied : ' no i am not			0
i do n't know how many times i have said the focus should be on negotiation			0
' he said he had no doubt that mr work ' would like to close this down ' and had probably got more money on the table outside court , but he was maintaining an open position ' where he and i are not on the same planet '			0
the court heard how both @entity6 and @entity19 were born in the @entity145 but had ' expatriated ' and both are now resident in @entity11			1
ms @entity19 told the court that the post-nup was part of the move to separate their assets when her husband first decided to give up his @entity145 citizenship to save tax in @entity145			1
mr @entity6 denied that was true .			0
