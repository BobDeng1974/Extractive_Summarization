following angry tweets , comments and complaints , @entity0 has now made it much easier to get rid of the @entity6 album that was added to millions of @entity8 accounts last week			1
the tech giant has created a dedicated page that lets users remove @entity12 simply by signing in with their @entity0 @entity13			1
@entity0 announced at its @entity15 launch event that the @entity18 band 's latest album would be added to every @entity20 account , in 119 countries around the world , for free			1
earlier this year , the firm automatically added @entity6 's @entity31 album to millions of @entity33 devices without permission			1
it was then forced to create a dedicated page ( pictured ) that made it easy for disgruntled users to remove the files unfortunately for @entity0 and @entity6 , many of these customers were not happy the @entity31 album had been forced upon them – and took to @entity42 and @entity43 to voice their upset			1
go to @entity0 's removal page , click @entity46 and enter your @entity0 @entity13			2
the album will be automatically removed from your account			0
the album was distributed to @entity52 users via @entity8 , which means it appears in the music app on devices , but is n’t physically stored on the computer , phone or tablet until it has been downloaded			2
if it has been downloaded , users can swipe to the left on each song and click @entity62 , but unless they use the recently created page , the album will still sit in the account			1
to hide the album from @entity52 manually , users must log into their account , find the album and click the cross in the top left - hand corner of the cover image			0
the album may also appear if the phone has the auto - download feature enabled			0
to turn this off , go to @entity77 , @entity52 & @entity78 , then disable @entity79			0
unless users remove the album , using @entity0 's latest link , the songs will still be played in shuffle mode			1
a manual fix for this is to create a custom playlist on an @entity33 device and exclude @entity6 ’s @entity89 from it			0
and @entity0 reportedly paid the band $ 100 million as part of the deal			1
the @entity93 claimed : ' to release @entity6 ’s album free , @entity0 paid the band and @entity96 an unspecified fee as a blanket royalty and committed to a marketing campaign for the band worth up to $ 100 million , according to several people briefed on the deal			1
