by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 08:34 est , 3 october 2013 middle - class parents claiming child benefits will have to register for assessment by the end of the week or face hundreds of pounds in fines			2
higher income parents have to submit their details @entity8 or they could be given a fine equal to what they owe			1
this saturday ’s deadline comes after child benefit was scrapped in households where the breadwinner earns £ 60,000 or more			1
high income parents face fine if they do not register for child benefit assessment by saturday the new policy requires parents to either opt out of receiving the benefit or submit a self - assessment form by october 5 so that @entity8 can calculate how much needs to be given back			1
child benefit is a tax free payment that allows parents to claim £ 20.30 a week for their eldest or an only child , and £ 13.40 a week for any other offspring			1
people can claim for all children under 16 or those under 20 if they are in full ' non-advanced ' education			0
in total almost eight million families with 13.7million children are paid the cash by @entity8 , but controversial changes in 2012 meant that @entity36 slowly withdrew it for families with individual parents earning more than £ 50,000			1
since january those earning more than £ 60,000 do n't get anything and those between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 have had it eroded			2
government policy demands unless they submit a self - assessment form by october 5 they face fines worth what they were paid			0
the form allows @entity8 to calculate how much needs to be given back to them by these high earners			2
@entity8 said it would impose a fine of 100per cent of what is owed only if it is clear the individual was ‘ evading ’ paying back their benefit			1
so far , about 220,000 of 1.1million affected parents have yet to register the form			0
@entity8 said as long as parents register and pay the tax due by january 31 , any penalty for missing the october deadline would be removed			1
@entity65 , head of taxation at the @entity67 , said unsuspecting parents could be hit with large fines if they are unaware of the deadline			2
‘ i really do worry that whatever @entity8 is saying there are going to be lots of people who find out too late they are expected to be paying something back , that they ’ve missed a deadline and could well be facing a penalty			2
‘ there are large numbers of people who have no idea this affects them and they do n’t realise self - assessment is something they are now going to be drawn into			0
mr @entity65 said the new tax policy will hurt parents who need financial support : ‘ it ’s such a dysfunctional way of taxing people			0
‘ in most cases the person in a household who does n’t receive the benefit is going to have to pay for something his or her partner is getting			0
think about where couples are separating , for example			0
’ so far 220,000 of 1.1million affected parents have yet to register the child benefit form @entity103 , from @entity104 , said full - time mothers are being undervalued in the push to cut child benefits			1
she said : ‘ it seems unfair that two parents both earning £ 40,000 a year can continue to receive child benefit where a household where one earns £ 50,000 will not			1
‘ it ’s completely disjointed and to me shows the government simply does not put a value on mothers staying at home and being there for their children			0
’ parents who stopped child benefit payments before january 7 2013 do not need to take further action			1
@entity121 , director at the @entity122 , said : ‘ what may seem like onerous form - filling is ultimately about helping people to pay the right amount of tax			0
‘ those already enrolled in self - assessment need not worry about the 5 october deadline , but those for whom it does apply should act quickly			0

higher income parents must submit details to @entity8
if they miss saturday deadline could be given fine equal to what they owe
child benefit scrapped in households where breadwinners earns £ *60k*
