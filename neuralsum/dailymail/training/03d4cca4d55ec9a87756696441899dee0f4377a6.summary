by @entity1 reporter not guilty : @entity2 walks away from @entity3 after he was cleared of sexual assault the father of former @entity6 footballers @entity7 and @entity8 has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman			1
@entity2 , 64 , admitted he engaged in sexual activity with the middle - aged complainant in her car just 20 yards from his house but said it was consensual			1
the woman told a jury at @entity3 that @entity2 drunkenly forced himself upon her			1
@entity2 bowed his head as the woman foreman delivered the verdict after the jury deliberated for just under 75 minutes			1
he then breathed a sigh of relief and looked upwards before he mouthed ' thank you ' in the direction of the jury			1
after he was told he could leave the dock , he stepped out and hugged his legal team			2
asked for a comment outside the courtroom , @entity2 said : ' i ca n't say anything right now			1
' his son , @entity7 , who cried as the verdict was delivered , stepped in and said : ' @entity35 , come on			1
he wo n't be saying anything			2
' earlier today , his defence lawyer told the jury @entity2 had ' imperilled his marriage and his children 's affections , trust and respect ' , but was not guilty of sexual assault			1
the jury of eight women and four men listened to closing speeches today from prosecution and defence counsel , along with @entity2 's two sons and his daughter , netball international @entity52 , in the public gallery			1
the incident was alleged to have taken place in @entity57 , @entity58 in the early hours of march 23 when the middle - aged complainant offered @entity2 a lift home in bad weather			1
@entity62 , prosecuting , said the case was not about ' precision of recollection ' but about who was telling the truth			2
' nothing seriously has been suggested to you about why ( the alleged victim ) should tell a pack of lies			0
nothing has been put forward by the defence as to why she should lie about it			0
has she really put herself through the ordeal of this trial on the back of a pack of lies ? ' he said			0
exit : @entity84 ( left ) drives his father away from court after he was cleared of the charges former @entity6 footballers @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) outside @entity89 where their father was today cleared of sexually assaulting a woman ' there can hardly be anyone in this country who has not read a newspaper or watched television over the last few years who does not know that is very likely to be a traumatic ordeal to give evidence when one is alleged to be the victim of a sexual crime			1
' if she had this consensual liaison with the defendant and then afterwards regrets it , or is even ashamed of it , the last thing she is going to do is to be talking about it			2
' is it not a remarkable coincidence that neither of them had any sexual interest in one another up until that very moment and suddenly in an instant without any preamble at all they both fall into each other 's arms			2
a bit @entity122 that is n't it ? ' @entity125 suggested that once @entity2 started kissing her , he could not stop and lost his self - control , mr @entity62 said			1
a combination of alcohol , opportunity and the fact that he fancied her led to him committing the offence , he said			0
it had been alleged @entity2 lunged at her , thrust his tongue down her throat , put his hand up her shirt and grabbed her breast			1
the complainant then said he placed his hand down her trousers and sexually assaulted her			0
netball international @entity143 arriving with her father @entity2 at @entity3 today @entity145 , defending , told the jury : ' there is nothing @entity122 about it			1
it is squalid whichever way one looks at the facts			0
most , if not all , of the evidence given involves details of events that are seldom talked about in private , yet alone aired in public			0
' it would be natural to feel sympathy for the alleged victim but feel limited sympathy for his client , he said			0
' mr @entity2 , upon his own admission , did something he should never have done , ' the barrister said			1
' sympathy for the @entity2 family and , in particular , his wife ( @entity169 )			1
sympathy wherever it lies will play no part in your deliberations			0
for a true verdict is a dispassionate one			2
' @entity84 was not called to give evidence yesterday because of his ' celebrity status ' , he said			0
' it simply is this			0
he was a son , no more or less , called on behalf of his father to give in brief an account of his experience of his father , ' mr @entity179 said			0
he asked the jury to disregard the alleged victim 's comparison of @entity2 to @entity187 when it was put to her that no one else had ever made a similar complaint about the defendant			1
' contrast that with the present case , ' he said			0
' not one other complaint			0
not one other communication , false or otherwise , to suggest that this defendant has been involved in any similar activity before and he accepts , from the word go , he had kissed and intimately touched ( the alleged victim )			2
' he asked the jury to consider whether it was the case that the complainant bitterly regretted her actions on the night and maybe convinced herself that it was without her consent			2
' this defendant has done wrong			0
he should never have kissed ( the alleged victim )			0
in doing so he imperilled his marriage and his children 's affections , trust and respect , and he is going to have to live with that			0
but on a fair assessment of the evidence heard , he is not guilty of the allegation made , ' mr @entity179 said .			0
