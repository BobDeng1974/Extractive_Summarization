stargazers across @entity1 were treated to an amazing display with the final partial solar eclipse of 2014			1
across the continent amateur astronomers , school children and photographers were able to track the sun , which looked like it had lost a bite - sized chunk			0
according to @entity10 , the partial eclipse was the final such event of the year			1
for @entity13 , the next total solar eclipse will take place on august 21 , 2017			1
the moon covers almost a third of the sun as it passes by the @entity18 of the @entity19 at @entity20 in @entity21 in @entity24 , the residents of @entity23 waited patiently as heavy cloud obscured the partial eclipse , giving only a two - minute glimpse over in @entity29 , the cloudless sky provided a perfect view of the eclipse - which was shot through a special filter a @entity10 spokesman said : ' throughout history , total eclipses , in which the entire sun is blocked from view , have offered scientists the chance to see the faint light of the sun 's atmosphere called the corona , without its being overwhelmed by the sun itself			2
' total eclipses provide views of that atmosphere , which we otherwise can only get with specialized telescopes â€“ both in space and on the ground -- that block out the bright light of the sun. as a partial eclipse , the october 23 eclipse is of less scientific interest , but it still makes for a great view ! ' in @entity60 , the event was overshadowed by heavy cloud but in the @entity64 arctic , more than three - quarters of the sun had been obscured			0
there are three types of solar eclipse , ranging from the total eclipse , where the sun is completely blocked out by the moon			2
a partial eclipse is where only a section of the sun is obscured			0
the final type of eclipse is the annular eclipse			0
this is where the moon appears smaller than the sun and blocks everything apart from an external fiery ring			0
in this combination photograph taken from @entity86 , the sun looks almost like a bloated @entity87 character in @entity89 , @entity90 , it appears like the moon has taken a slightly larger chunk out of the sun as it approaches its zenith in @entity96 , this images was taken in @entity97 in the @entity98 , showing several sun spots up in the @entity102 more than two - thirds of the sun is obscured from this vantage point in @entity104 , @entity105 in @entity107 , @entity108 , a bird flies low past the sun which is silhouetted against some high - tension power lines when looking at a solar eclipse it is necessary to wear appropriate equipment as staring at the sun can cause blindness in @entity117 , this couple watch the sun setting off @entity119 on the @entity120 for the last partial eclipse of the year this image was taken from @entity123 in @entity124 @entity117 from behind a tree these fishermen in @entity127 , @entity117 do n't seem too worried about the last eclipse in @entity1 until august 2017 people in @entity130 , @entity131 , only got the shortest of glimpses at the eclipse due to heavy cloud cover in the area			1

@entity13 *queued* up in their thousands to see the final partial solar eclipse of 2014 which crossed the nation
unfortunately for eclipse fans , they will have to travel to @entity144 if they want any solar action next year
but in a special treat , @entity10 predicts that on august 21 , 2017 a total solar eclipse will hit @entity1
