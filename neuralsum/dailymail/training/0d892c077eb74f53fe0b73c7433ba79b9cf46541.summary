‘ and that was the exact way it was said			0
it was n’t like you know , “ i ’m gon na pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet ” , but if i stay quiet , i would [ be ] “ looked after ”			0
’ miss @entity4 , who is now 30 and has now returned to her native @entity57 , said she was then called again by the lawyers a week later and was put on to @entity6			1

miss @entity4 expressed her disgust at a photograph which showed the royal and @entity6 walking together in @entity35 after the disgraced tycoon had served just 13 months in jail ‘ apparently there was an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that @entity6 had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes so they would n’t be looked upon as worthy in the court ’s eyes			1
’ miss @entity4 claims she told @entity6 she did not ‘ want to be a part of it ’ and would not speak out			1

he allegedly told his victims ‘ bad things ’ would happen to them if they spoke out			0
investigators believe @entity6 was desperate to stop the witnesses being called to give evidence before a @entity152 , where they may have been granted immunity from prosecution to tell the truth			0
instead , he hired an ‘ army of legal superstars ’ to persuade prosecution lawyers to sign a controversial plea agreement			0
many of the charges against @entity6 and any ‘ co-conspirators ’ were removed in return for him pleading guilty to a relatively minor charge of soliciting an under - age girl for prostitution , for which he served just 13 months in jail			2
