@entity0 will not be playing in the @entity1 this summer after losing 2 - 1 to @entity2 in their decisive final qualifier			1
having beaten @entity5 and @entity6 in their opening @entity8 qualifiers , the @entity4 had to beat @entity2 in @entity9 to advance to july 's finals in @entity11 but goals from @entity13 and @entity14 put the hosts in command and a late response from @entity19 's @entity18 was n't enough to rescue @entity21 's team			1
@entity18 was on target for @entity0 's @entity4 against @entity2 but it was n't enough to qualify boosted by the return of @entity26 midfielder @entity25 from suspension , @entity21 reverted to the line - up that had beaten @entity5 3 - 2 late last week			1
a swirling wind in @entity30 made playing conditions difficult , with any long balls ineffective , and consequently the first period saw very few chances			0
@entity2 managed to take one of theirs , however , just after the half - hour mark			0
@entity38 fired the ball into a crowded penalty area and @entity13 had the presence of mind to divert it past @entity0 goalkeeper @entity43			2
@entity45 ' @entity44 came close to equalising shortly before half - time but sent @entity48 's cross over the bar inside the six - yard box			0
@entity21 's team have missed out on this summer 's @entity53 finals in @entity11 @entity2 's second goal , five minutes into the second half , left @entity0 with a mountain to climb			2
@entity57 again provided the assist , passing to @entity14 to drill the ball in off the near post			0
the home side were almost over the finish line but there was a flicker of hope for @entity0 when @entity18 halved the deficit from a @entity68 cross 11 minutes from time			0
but @entity0 required a further two goals because of their inferior goal difference in the group and there was to be no late drama as their @entity75 ambitions faded			1

late response from @entity19 's @entity18 was n't enough
