@entity5 , a five - year - old beagle , right , was almost torn in two after an @entity10 bulldog sunk its teeth into her body during a random one - bite attack in @entity17 , @entity18 earlier this month but the wound reopened and could not be stitched back up because most of the skin had shed off			1
now the dog has undergone revolutionary treatment at the @entity27 in @entity28 - known as the @entity27 - to have her wound stuck together with the @entity3 - style type			1
her owner , @entity32 , says the treatment she is receiving is the first of its kind in the @entity37			2
the tape is only used on animals , not on humans			2
the 46 - year - old said : ' @entity42 is still in the care of the @entity27 in @entity28			1
she is getting the treatment and will be the first in the @entity37 to get it			2
