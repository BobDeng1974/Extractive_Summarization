so this video , filmed by a hidden camera in a @entity10 park , is a unique opportunity to see how wildlife behave when they are not in the presence of humans			1
and the result may be surprising - because the bears appear to be pole - dancing around a tree in the middle of the woods			2
scroll down to watch the video dance party : a family of bears has been filmed dancing around a tree in a @entity10 park comfort : the bears were apparently attracted by the chance to scratch their backs on the tree 's bark pose : the unusual positions taken by the animals are reminiscent of human pole - dancing the extraordinary video was filmed in @entity36 , a large expanse of national park in the province of @entity40			1
part of it was made with a normal camera , and part with a night - vision lens , so that it captures wildlife at play 24 hours a day			0
over a number of days in may and june this year , a variety of animals including deer and black bears approached the tree which the camera was trained on			2
bounce : some have compared the bears ' antics to the popular dance move twerking @entity58 : this grizzly was the first bear to discover the therapeutic effects of the tree in @entity36 bandwagon : a black bear also joined in the fun by going to scratch its back on the tree but rangers really hit the jackpot when a family of grizzly bears discovered the tree and adopted it as their latest plaything			1
when the first bear arrived , he began scratching his back against the bark			0
this apparently produced such a pleasant sensation that he spread the news to other grizzlies , and before long they were all checking out the tree			2
wildlife : this deer was another animal to be caught on the rangers ' camera in late may and early june night vision : the camera was not only operating in daylight hours but filmed through the night too at one point , as many as four bears were vying to grab a spot on the tree - and their vigorous motion made it look as though they were pole - dancing			1
the video of still images edited together and set to an upbeat soundtrack by @entity102 was uploaded to @entity103 by @entity40 parks offficials			0
it has garnered more than 200,000 views in less than a week as viewers flocked to enjoy the wild antics .			0
