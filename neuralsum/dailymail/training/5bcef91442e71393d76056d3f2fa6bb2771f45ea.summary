by @entity0 published : 20:56 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 10:09 est , 4 january 2014 serenaded by a jazz band , a chapter of @entity4 , his family and more old geezers than on the @entity7 , @entity1 made his last escape yesterday afternoon — to the hereafter			1
his wicker coffin draped in the flags of @entity12 and his adopted @entity13 , the best - known — if least important — of the @entity14 was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same @entity19 crematorium as @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22 of @entity23			1
but here , too , were all the trappings of a traditional gangland funeral — minus the horse - drawn hearse and gold knuckledusters			2
the rules did not seem to apply to floral tributes , though			0
one mourner had sent one in the shape of @entity1 ’s trademark v - sign			1
@entity51 and the poems of @entity1 the bard himself were liberally quoted in a service that drew large numbers of shaven - headed men in leather coats and a few hard - smoking women			1
how many actually knew the man ? one of the @entity4 cheerfully admitted he was just a ‘ hanger on ’ , but said he was glad to be part of it all			0
there was also a smattering of celebrities from showbusiness and the criminocracy			0
actor @entity68 arrived late — ‘ the traffic was murder ’ he told a congregation not unfamiliar with the real thing — to deliver his reflections on ‘ a modern - day @entity74 ’			2
drug smuggler - turned - author @entity75 saluted ‘ a man of great nobility ’ while admitting he had never actually met @entity1 in person			1
celebrity ex-gangster @entity80 arrived bearing a floral display in the shape of a train and the succinct inscription ‘ gutted ’			0
in loving memory : a copy of the order of service for the funeral of @entity1 send off : the @entity4 bikers arrive at the funeral , leading the coffin to the crematorium armed robber and certified madman @entity94 also sent a bouquet from prison and a separate message that was read out during the service : ‘ @entity1 was an icon , a man ’s man			1
@entity102 respect to a diamond geezer			0
’ there was a lot of this sort of stuff all afternoon and on into the night as the mourners grew increasingly lachrymose at a boozer on the @entity110			0
also represented was another strand of @entity19 criminal folklore in the form of @entity114 , erstwhile henchman of the @entity115			0
but for all the clapped - out tough guy posturing and half - hearted clenched fist salutes , the most genuine moment of the day was when @entity1 ’s son , @entity40 , delivered a moving eulogy to the father who had , for many years , raised him as a single parent in @entity123			1
acknowledging that @entity1 the villain had been a ‘ petty crook who never had any real success ’ , he spoke emotionally of the jazz - loving , samba - dancing , @entity36 - mad champion of the underdog who became ‘ my dad , my mum , my entire family ’			2
tribute : a six - piece @entity137 band joined the procession for the final part of the journey to the crematorium.leading the hearse and funeral cars , it played songs including @entity144 @entity145 : @entity1 , seen last year when he made his final public appearance ( left ) , gives a two - fingered salute			1
he was involved in the @entity31 when he was much younger ( right ) in 1963 @entity40 was the product of @entity1 ’s affair with a @entity13 dancer after he had fled to @entity123 from @entity151 when his cover was blown in 1970			1
his first wife , the devoted @entity153 , remained in @entity151 with their two surviving sons ( another boy , @entity157 , died in a car accident )			0
she still lives there , still bears his name and had sent her own recording of @entity51 ’s sonnet — ‘ let me not to the marriage of true minds			0
admit impediments ... ’ this was more than goodbye to a famous ex-con			0
this was a farewell to that black - and - white world of old - style cops and robbers , of ‘ @entity173 ’ and ‘ @entity174 , of bygone heists planned in smoke - filled pubs and exhaustively chronicled by @entity177 for the benefit of a more innocent world			0
@entity31 remains the last criminal showstopper of modern times which did not involve guns , knives , death , sex or drugs			2
the 30 - year sentence @entity1 received would be inconceivable now			2
final sendoff : draped in both a @entity12 flag and a @entity13 flag - in honour of the @entity193 country where he spent so many years on the run - @entity1 ' coffin is taken to his funeral @entity4 : the bikers went in front of the funeral cortege as the coffin was driven to the crematorium tribute act : the bikers arrive at @entity1 ' family 's home in @entity205 , north @entity19 , to make the journey to the crematorium for all the sentimental tosh spoken about it yesterday , however , it was no @entity209 comedy			1
train driver @entity210 received a savage beating and many of those involved were never the same again			1
@entity1 was not a key member of the gang that seized more than £ 2.6 million from the @entity217 - to - @entity19 mail train in august 1963			1
his job had merely been to supply a bent train driver to replace @entity220 ( in the end , @entity1 ’s man was not even up to the task )			1
@entity1 himself once likened his role to that of ‘ teaboy ’			2
his notoriety and enduring celebrity followed his escape from @entity231 to @entity151 and , latterly , @entity13 , where he spent 31 years raising his proverbial two fingers to @entity12 justice			2
even after returning home in 2001 , upon which he was immediately imprisoned , his attitude was much the same			0
short of cash and laid low by three strokes , he threw himself at the mercy of the @entity240 and the @entity12 taxpayer , pleading : ‘ i am a sick man			0
my last wish is to walk into a @entity244 pub as an @entity245 and buy a pint of bitter			0
’ defiant to the last : thief @entity1 swears at photographers at the funeral of fellow @entity250 last year living it up : @entity1 relaxes in @entity13 in 1997 where he spent 36 years on the run from @entity12 justice before returning to get medical care notorious : @entity1 , who died last month , revelled in the fame his heinous crime brought him in 2009 , @entity12 was taken for another ride when @entity1 was released from prison in the belief that he was about to die			1
two years later , he was still well enough to say that he was ‘ proud ’ to have been one of the robbers , adding : ‘ i would do it all again without the slightest hesitation ! ’ nine months ago , hunched in a wheelchair at the funeral of gang leader @entity250 , @entity1 raised another two - fingered salute at the media			1
yet it was the media whom @entity1 had to thank for the one thing that kept the money rolling in long after his stolen loot ran out : the legend of @entity1			2
yesterday , that legend came to an end , far from the dancing girls of the @entity279 , in @entity38			0
as his son admitted fondly , the old rogue had not even left enough money to cover last night ’s bar bill .			0

@entity1 , the @entity31 , died last month aged *84*
a @entity13 flag draped over @entity32 across the coffin
@entity1 gave a two - fingered salute last time he was seen in public
great @entity292 fled with £ 2.6m in 1963 - £ *46m* in today 's money
train driver @entity210 was beaten over the head and never fully *recovered*
