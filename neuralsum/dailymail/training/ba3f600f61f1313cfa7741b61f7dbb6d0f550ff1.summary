one @entity1 club has spent a shed load of money trying to keep up with their local rivals - and it is strange to think that it is united splashing the cash			1
last season they finished 22 points adrift of @entity12 champions @entity11 and @entity13 was brought in ( and given a healthy amount to spend ) to ensure this did not happen again			1
very noisy neighbours @entity11 are just as able to have another delve into the market place , of course , and turn the new order into a familiar one			1
@entity22 can get to within five points of @entity11 with a win at @entity25 on monday @entity11 's players , pictured celebrating a goal at @entity28 's , are attempting to chase down @entity29 @entity22 boss @entity13 is planning another £ 150million spending spree to close the gap on rivals @entity11 1976 - 77 @entity32 @entity33 2			1
@entity11 42 21 14 7 60 34 +26 56 6			1
man united 42 18 11 13 71 62 +9 47 1977 - 78 @entity32 @entity33 4			0
@entity11 42 20 12 10 74 51 +23 52 10			2
man united 42 16 10 16 67 63 +4 42 @entity22 can close the gap on @entity11 to five points by beating @entity25 on monday night			1
@entity39 's team are on a good run of form with four straight wins and just one defeat in nine matches			2
perhaps ' just ' is not the right word			0
losing 1 - 0 to their inter-city rivals will rankle more than any other loss to most fans			2
yet the fact of the matter is that @entity22 are continuing to play catch - up with @entity11 , who in turn are hanging on to the coat tails of @entity29			1
@entity22 may well finish below @entity11 for a second successive season and that has not happened since @entity59 topped the charts with @entity61			1
in other words , may 1978			0
@entity22 have been the undisputed kings of @entity1 pretty much ever since			2
even when @entity11 won the @entity12 in 2012 , it went to the wire with only goal difference separating the clubs			2
@entity11 midfielder @entity67 runs off to celebrate scoring his side 's winner against @entity70 @entity22 goalkeeper @entity71 ( left ) tussles with @entity11 's @entity73 at @entity74 in march , 1977 @entity12 table that all changed with the retirement of sir @entity78			1
since the wily @entity79 called it a day in may 2013 , @entity22 have spent £ 215m on new players			2
@entity81 has come and gone and , in his place , @entity83 van @entity13 is beginning to make his mark at @entity74			0
last summer saw the arrival of the likes of @entity89 ( £ 60m ) , @entity90 ( £ 27m ) , @entity91 ( £ 16m ) , @entity92 ( £ 29m ) and @entity93 ( £ 13.8m )			0
@entity94 was signed on a £ 6m loan			0
quality players all , even though not all of them have hit the heights on a regular basis yet			0
@entity100 is now injured , as well , which makes it even harder for @entity22 to make in - roads on their close rivals			1
@entity39 is still dissatisfied and could step up the hunt for a world - class central defender , whether in january or in summer			0
striker @entity94 is not regarded as fit enough to spearhead @entity22 's attack for 90 minutes , which means an over-reliance on @entity111 and @entity112 so that may also be a position which needs further strengthening			1
look at the @entity12 goals tally , and that says everything			0
@entity112 has five , @entity119 and @entity111 have scored four while @entity100 has chipped in with three – and we are in december			0
@entity22 's best hope may be that @entity122 is set to be without @entity123 for the busy @entity125 period			1
the @entity127 's dodgy knee could be a blessing down the road			0
@entity112 ( right ) breaks away from @entity67 during @entity11 's 1 - 0 win against @entity22 at the @entity131 in november @entity94 , @entity92 and @entity119 ( left to right ) have all arrived at @entity74 in the last year each time @entity22 added to their squad , the danger is that @entity11 can also recruit big			1
they were almost modest in their spending last summer , although @entity137 @entity136 did cost £ 32m from @entity138			0
the young defender was one of the hottest properties in @entity141 last season and once upon a time might have been the sort of player @entity22 could have tempted without a problem			2
sadly for @entity39 , he can not even offer @entity148 football as an incentive			0
when @entity78 retired , the general consensus was that the squad required an overhaul simply to stay in the same place			0
treading water is no good , however , when all around are swimming furiously			0
@entity29 have set the benchmark this season , followed closely by @entity11			2
@entity11 forward @entity123 could miss a month of action after injuring his knee against @entity70 on saturday @entity111 is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring in @entity22 's 3 - 0 win against @entity161 @entity163 ' top four finish far from certain ' - @entity39 @entity22 find themselves in a chasing pack which includes the likes of @entity167 and @entity25			1
last year they were so far behind @entity11 that there were no exhaust fumes to choke on			2
the position has improved this year			0
@entity22 are making a fight of it , at least , despite a huge injury list which has decimated them of defenders and meant the likes of @entity177 playing in defence			1
@entity39 is not a fan of the festive fixture jam but , maybe , he should look at it another way			0
there are a lot of matches for @entity123 to miss ! @entity185 here to like our @entity22 facebook page .			1

@entity22 are currently eight points behind @entity11
@entity123 's *absence* through injury could help @entity22 's chase
@entity11 last finished above their local rivals in consecutive seasons in 1978
@entity22 can go third with a win against @entity25 on monday night
