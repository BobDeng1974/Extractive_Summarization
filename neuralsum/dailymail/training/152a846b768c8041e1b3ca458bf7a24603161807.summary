by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 3 may 2012 updated : 10:41 est , 3 may 2012 a hair - raisingly close fly - by by @entity4 's @entity3 aims to learn more about what lurks beneath the icy moon @entity7 's surface - and what exactly lurks in the ' geysers ' of ice it spews into space			1
@entity3 captured a startling new picture of the jets , which a scientist claimed earlier this year could be ' snowing microbes ' onto the icy moon			1
@entity4 's @entity3 probe flew past the icy moon @entity7 just 46 miles above the surface to gauge whether there is liquid water beneath the surface - and captured an image of the moon 's ' geysers ' of ice as it passed by these jets , which spew through cracks in the moon 's icy shell , could lead back to a habitable zone that is uniquely accessible in all the solar system			1
this week , @entity3 flew past the moon just 46 miles above the surface			1
the radio science team is particularly interested in learning how mass is distributed under @entity7 ' south polar region , which features jets of water ice , water vapor and organic compounds spraying out of long fractures			1
a concentration of mass in that region could indicate subsurface liquid water - where life could lurk			2
@entity3 's scientists learn about the moon 's internal structure by measuring variations in the gravitational pull of @entity7 against the steady radio link to @entity4 's @entity52 on @entity54 's composite infrared spectrometer instrument will also be observing the side of @entity7 that always faces away from @entity56 to monitor for hot spots			1
the imaging camera team also plans to take images of the plume to look for variability in the jets			0
dramatic plumes , both large and small , spray water ice from many locations near the south pole of @entity56 's moon @entity7 ‘ more than 90 jets of all sizes near @entity7 's south pole are spraying water vapor , icy particles , and organic compounds all over the place , ’ @entity68 , planetary scientist and leader of the imaging science team for @entity4 ’s @entity3 spacecraft told @entity4 ’s @entity72 earlier thsi year			1
‘ @entity3 has flown several times now through this spray and has tasted it			1
and we have found that aside from water and organic material , there is salt in the icy particles			2
the salinity is the same as that of @entity92 's oceans			2
@entity3 passed @entity7 first on march 27 - coming within 46 miles - then passed the small moon @entity93 with a closest approach distance of 27,000 miles ( 44,000 kilometres )			1
and early on march 28 , the spacecraft flew by @entity97 at a distance of 27,000 miles ( 44,000 kilometres )			2
thermal measurements of @entity7 's fissures have revealed temperatures as high as @entity102			1
‘ if you add up all the heat , 16 gigawatts of thermal energy are coming out of those cracks , ’ said @entity68			2
she believes the small moon , with its sub-surface liquid sea , organics , and an energy source , may host the same type of life we find in similar environments on @entity92			0
she said : ‘ the kind of ecologies @entity7 might harbour could be like those deep within our own planet			2
@entity121 heat and liquid water are found in @entity92 's subterranean volcanic rocks			0
scientists believe the geysers may be coming from vast seas full of microbes ‘ organisms in those rocks thrive on hydrogen ( produced by reactions between liquid water and hot rocks ) and available carbon dioxide and make methane , which gets recycled back into hydrogen			0
and it 's all done entirely in the absence of sunlight or anything produced by sunlight			0
’ but what makes @entity7 special is that its habitable zone offers itself up for easy access			2
she said : ‘ it 's erupting out into space where we can sample it			0
it sounds crazy but it could be snowing microbes on the surface of this little world			0
in the end , it 's is the most promising place i know of for an astrobiology search			0
‘ we do n't even need to go scratching around on the surface			0
we can fly through the plume and sample it			0
or we can land on the surface , look up and stick our tongues out			0
and voila , we have what we came for			0
’ rock on : @entity56 's @entity93 , which @entity3 also buzzed close - up : @entity56 's moon @entity97 at approximately 27,668 miles the source of @entity7 's heat appears to be @entity56 itself			1
researchers say @entity56 's gravitational pull causes the moon 's shape to change slightly on a daily basis as it orbits			1
flexing motions in its interior generate heat - like the heat you feel in a paperclip when you bend it back and forth rapidly			0
@entity68 said : ‘ but the tidal flexing occurring now is not enough to account for all the heat presently coming out of @entity7			1
one way out of this dilemma is to assume that some of the heat observed today was been generated and stored internally in the past			0
’ @entity68 believes @entity7 's orbit could have been much more eccentric , and the greater the eccentricity , she says , the greater the tidal flexing and resulting structural variations that produce the heat			1
in this scenario , the heat would have been stored inside the little moon by melting some of the ice to recharge the liquid sea			2
she added : ‘ now that the orbit 's eccentricity has lessened , the heat emanating from the interior is a combination of heat produced today and in the past			0
but since more heat is coming out presently than is being produced , @entity7 is in a cooling off stage and the liquid water is returning to ice			1
‘ there are models to show that it never really freezes entirely , so the eccentricity may increase again , restarting the cycle			0

@entity3 passed @entity7 on may 2 - coming within 46 miles
