the presents may have been well and truly opened , but the footballers are wrapping up			0
with the temperature in @entity6 beginning its inevitable decline as we frostily shuffle into the new year , some of the @entity4 's biggest stars kept themselves safe from the cold winter air by donning football 's old familiar friend - the snood			1
concluding their final session for this year , the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 players made their way out to the training pitches to prepare themselves for the second half of the @entity4 season			1
with his side heading into 2015 just outside of a @entity49 place , @entity46 's men were in high spirits as the @entity51 took them through their paces			0
@entity16 also braved the cold at their new Â£ 200million @entity55 training complex , with @entity57 duo @entity56 and @entity58 both sporting a lovely stripey number ... in blue and white , of course			2
pick of the bunch was @entity15 boss @entity22 who , unlike that all - too - familiar scene with @entity64 and an unforgiving bib , had no struggle putting on his kit while his team got ready for their clash with @entity71 on thursday			0
the @entity72 have it all to lose as they march on into next year , proudly perched at the top of the table three points ahead of @entity16			0
