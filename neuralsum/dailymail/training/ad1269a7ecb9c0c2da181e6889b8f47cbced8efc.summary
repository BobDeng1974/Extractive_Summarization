@entity0 has invited @entity1 to the @entity2 – for the @entity4 enforcer believes he is the man to anchor @entity6 ’s midfield			1
there has been much debate over the merits of @entity11 ’s @entity10 in such a role and it is the one position in @entity1 ’s team which appears up for grabs			1
@entity0 ’s former @entity4 team - mate @entity16 – now at @entity17 – had been earmarked for a trial run in the holding berth until injury ruled him out of the recent matches with @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity4 's @entity0 believes he is the man to anchor @entity6 ’s midfield but @entity4 ’s in - form midfielder has urged @entity6 manager @entity1 to check on his progress having made huge strides under the tutorship of @entity28 on @entity29			1
indeed , the @entity31 boss says his own country would relish a @entity34 type at the heart of their engine - room			2
and the 26 - year - old said : ‘ you see lads getting opportunities now and for me that has got to be a motivation			2
‘ in recent years , it is not something for me to be too interested in because of the names that were playing - the @entity47 and the @entity48			2
but you look at the boys who have got in and who are playing well and that is something that i am trying to achieve			0
‘ so yes , it has become a goal for me getting into the squad			0
@entity6 is going through that cycle of change right now			1
@entity4 's @entity0 is hindered by a chequered disciplinary record ‘ we ’ve got a few @entity60 players here – @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and me - and i ’d like to think @entity1 will come up ( to see us play )			1
’ @entity0 , of course , is hindered by a chequered disciplinary record , seven red cards having earned him the nickname ‘ @entity69 ’			1
but he has now enjoyed a run of 28 matches without seeing red – he previously averaged a dismissal every 26 games , a ratio only bettered by @entity76 and @entity77 – and believes a calmer head is a by - product of @entity28 ’s faith			1
‘ i am in a good time in my career at the moment , ’ he went on			0
‘ i feel i am not having to try as hard on the pitch and that helps			0
‘ that is a big thing for me			0
i am really comfortable about my game , very focussed every week now			0
@entity0 has now enjoyed a run of 28 matches without seeing red ‘ @entity28 sides have a big role for the defensive midfielder			1
since the manager has come in i have adapted my game to what he wants and that is pure and simple , a defensive midfielder			1
i have learnt an unbelievable amount since he came here			0
’ @entity0 was capped at every level from under - 16 to under - 21 and admits he expected to progress to the seniors			1
and the former @entity100 academy player makes no secret of his desire to once again pull on the white of his country			0
‘ my last game for the @entity106 was in the @entity108 final in @entity109 against @entity110			0
i could have played on the next season but @entity112 told me it was time for the next generation , ’ he said			0
@entity115 made his @entity6 debut against @entity23 on monday ‘ i probably did expect a senior call up at the time			1
so it would mean an awful lot to me to get a call - up now			2
every @entity60 player would be lying if they said they were not looking to play for @entity6			2
‘ the wider perception is that players do n’t care but a lot of the time , it is just trying to be cool around each other , not letting on how much you really do care			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , believes there would be room for himself and @entity134 adversary @entity16 in the @entity6 set - up			1
‘ @entity10 has got in thanks to his performances for us last season and he has obviously had a good pre-season ( at @entity17 ) , ’ he said			0
‘ the manager obviously fancies him and fair play to him			0
i spoke to @entity10 last week and he really enjoyed his time with @entity6			2
now he is in that circle he has an opportunity to improve himself			0
