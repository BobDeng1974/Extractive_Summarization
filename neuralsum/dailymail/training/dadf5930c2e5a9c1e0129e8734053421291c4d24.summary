by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:30 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 10:31 est , 28 november 2013 @entity3 's first minister @entity2 was challenged about his plans to join the @entity5 @entity2 today desperately insisted that an independent @entity3 would be able to stay in the @entity5 , after the idea was rejected out of hand by the prime minister of spain			1
the @entity10 ’s blueprint for independence depends on @entity3 negotiating its way into the @entity5			1
but the plan collapse within 24 hours when @entity15 ’s @entity14 insisted it could not become an @entity5 member automatically and he would veto it			1
mr @entity2 has insisted that @entity3 would be able to join the @entity5 if it votes yes to independence next year but mr @entity14 ’s intervention exploded that claim			1
@entity15 is opposed to @entity3 secession since the government in @entity23 is also resisting attempts by @entity25 and the @entity27 region to break away			2
the @entity15 premier told a press conference : ‘ if part of a member state becomes independent , it would be left out of the @entity5 and it would be good for citizens ( in the @entity5 ) and @entity3 to know that , " he is reported to have said			1
mr @entity14 added this meant ‘ @entity5 entry would need to be approved by all 28 member states ’			1
he went on : ‘ i am very clear , as everyone is , that a country that obtained independence from the @entity5 would end up outside of it , and it ’s right that @entity3 citizens and all the citizens of the @entity5 know that			2
‘ what i want is for the @entity3 to be presented realistically with the consequences of secession			2
‘ if one part if a member state splits , it would become a third country in relation to the @entity5			0
’ he added : ‘ the times we live in demand strong countries and unity is not contrary to autonomy , it is a guarantee of strength in an increasingly complex and globalised world			0
’ the remarks from one of the @entity5 ’s senior leaders have been seized on by opponents of independence , who challenged mr @entity2 at @entity68 today			2
@entity15 's prime minister @entity14 said that all 28 @entity5 member states would have to agree to allow a new member in , and he would be likely to veto @entity3 the first minister said if there was a @entity74 vote in next year 's referendum @entity3 would be ‘ negotiating its position from within the @entity5 ’ - citing a letter from the @entity78 in support of this			1
@entity82 's @entity81 , @entity84 @entity83 and liberal democrat @entity85 all attacked mr @entity2 on the matter at @entity71 's questions			0
ms @entity88 went on the attack , saying : ‘ the @entity15 prime minister is being straighter with the people of @entity3 than the first minister			2
’ but mr @entity2 said : ‘ the difference is @entity3 would be negotiating its position from within the @entity5			0
’ the first minister then cited a letter from the @entity78 , which he said stated it would ‘ of course be legally possible to renegotiate the situation of the @entity97 and @entity3 within the @entity5 ’			0
he said that was ‘ reasonably substantial evidence that @entity3 as a nation can negotiate its position to full membership within the @entity5 ’			1
on tuesday mr @entity2 launched his historic 670 - page blueprint covering all areas of life in an independent @entity3			0
at the launch he was dogged by questions about how he will get the @entity108 government , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and the @entity112 to agree to his ambitious plans			0
it revealed he wants the @entity97 to continue to bail - out @entity3 's banks , shoulder its debts and fund degrees for its students			0
and it spelt out in bizarre detail that shows like @entity122 , @entity124 and @entity125 and kids ' channel @entity123 would remain on air , in an attempt to counter fears from tv viewers that they would be cut off from the @entity112 .			0
