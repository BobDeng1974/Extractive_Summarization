by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was left with plenty to ponder after an inept defensive display allowed @entity5 to run out easy 3 - 1 winners at the @entity7 in @entity8			2
on the evidence of their first - half collapse , it will take more than new right - back @entity13 – watching from the stands – to plug the holes in @entity18 's backline this season			1
@entity2 's side were prised open at will by the @entity22 outfit and they duly raced into a three - goal lead by half - time			1
@entity2 will complete the loan signing of striker @entity42 next week but he could well be minded to re-enter the market for defensive reinforcements			2
it took just two minutes for @entity5 to fashion their first sight at goal as @entity48 blazed over from 12 yards after @entity49 , the former @entity50 striker , delivered from the right			2
@entity5 were exposing the @entity53 backline with alarming ease during the early exchanges and @entity56 spread his frame to block from @entity58 after the @entity59 had scampered in on goal			2
@entity60 did work one opening for @entity62 but his volley , from @entity65 's deep free - kick , could only locate the side - netting			1
@entity68 was causing the @entity70 side all manner of problems down the right and , when he landed an inch - perfect cross on the unmarked forehead of @entity76 six yards out , the midfielder somehow contrived to nod over the crossbar			1
tricky customer : former @entity50 striker @entity49 featured for @entity5 against @entity18 @entity18 : @entity56 , @entity79 ( @entity80 84 ) , @entity81 , @entity36 ( @entity82 74 ) , @entity40 ( @entity83 46 ) , @entity84 ( @entity85 74 ) , @entity33 ( @entity86 67 ) , @entity62 ( @entity87 46 ) , @entity88 ( @entity26 46 ) , @entity65 ( @entity29 46 ) , @entity89 ( @entity90 46 )			1
subs not used : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity13 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			0
malaga starting xi : @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 ; @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity48 ; @entity58 , @entity107			0
goals : @entity76 25 , @entity109 32 and 4			0
@entity76 , though , made amends on 25 minutes when he lashed home the game 's opening goal from 25 yards , leaving @entity56 helpless as his strike cannoned into the back of the net via the base of the post			0
@entity107 was next to take advantage of @entity60 's porous rearguard as he broke free in the area but again @entity56 spared his defenders ' blushes			1
there was nothing he could do to prevent @entity5 's second on the half - hour mark , however , @entity129 escaping down the right yet again before dropping his centre on @entity109 's boot and he dispatched an uncompromising volley beyond @entity56 from eight yards			0
the 19 - year - old helped himself to a second just before the break , lashing into the top corner – albeit via the aid of a deflection – having been afforded too much room on the angle of the penalty area			0
@entity105 should have made it four shortly after the restart for the second half but headed wide from a corner when unmarked just four yards from goal			0
@entity18 outcast @entity26 has been told he can find a new club and the winger did at least serve a reminder of his worth with a fine consolation , leathering into the bottom corner having made strides into the area from a short corner			1
but it was matters at the other end which will be of @entity2 's chief concern .			0

former @entity60 winger @entity26 gets himself on the *scoresheet*
however @entity22 outfit claim win against @entity18 in @entity166
@entity18 take on @entity169 side @entity168 on *sunday* *afternoon*
