cannabis smokers in their 30s have lungs so badly damaged that they look like an 80 year old ’s , doctors have warned			2
they say that young adults who have smoked cannabis for less than a decade are turning up at @entity8 with a severe , rapid and advanced form of the lung disease emphysema			2
some are in their 30s and in some cases their lungs are so badly damaged that they are put on long - term oxygen therapy			1
@entity34 , in which the millions of tiny air sacs in the lungs are gradually damaged , is normally caused by tobacco and usually occurs late in life			1
it is thought the cannabis - tobacco mixture found in joints is more damaging because they are often smoked without a filter			1
cannabis smokers also tend to inhale for longer and much of the cannabis on sale today is much stronger than in the past			0
dr @entity49 , a consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity51 , who studied eight patients who had smoked at least five joints a day , said : ‘ we are seeing young people on the wards with the lungs of 80 year olds after less than a decade of smoking cannabis and tobacco			0
young adults who have smoked cannabis for less than a decade are turning up at @entity8 with a severe , rapid and advanced form of the lung disease emphysema ( pictured ) ‘ our study was in a rural region of @entity19 but we believe these cases may represent the tip of the iceberg			1
‘ cannabis is far stronger these days and we are seeing the emergence of a new severe form of emphysema – which could lead to people struggling for breath for the rest of their life			0
‘ we urgently need a detailed study across the @entity78 which analyses the national picture of cannabis - use and lung disease			2
’ dr @entity82 , of the @entity27 , said : ‘ this study is yet another small but persuasive piece of a jigsaw pointing to a real danger of regularly smoking joints			0
‘ the government should monitor this emerging evidence carefully and take it into account when considering future drugs and smoking policy			0

many , who are just in their 30s , are in need of long - term oxygen therapy
one patient in @entity31 , @entity19 , is now awaiting a lung transplant
