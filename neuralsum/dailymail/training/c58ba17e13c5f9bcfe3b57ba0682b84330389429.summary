by @entity0 major companies operating in @entity4 do not have measures in place to ensure their products are free from child labour or forced labour , a two - year investigation into the electronics industry has revealed			0
some of the high - profile companies investigated that need to make improvements include @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity16 - based @entity15 and @entity4 - owned @entity17 fared the worst among the companies investigated , in a report from @entity20			1
in the @entity23 , @entity22 - based @entity21 was rated the best in most categories			2
despite coming under fire last year for their practices regarding child and forced labour in @entity16 , @entity26 sits fairly high on the rankings - being awarded a b + overall @entity21 ( only company to pay partial living wage ) , @entity26 , @entity34 and @entity35 b - @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 @entity48 and @entity13 ( @entity49 , @entity50 , essentials and name - brand ) @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 @entity62 + - @entity61 @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , @entity14 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 d - - @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 @entity15 and @entity17 companies were ranked based on their efforts to combat child exploitation and slavery in their supply chains			1
the report , released on wednesday , provides a way for consumers to check up on the business practices of electronics companies , and chose who to buy from accordingly			1
it also allows companies to compare their practices with their peers			0
all of the 39 companies investigated have room for improvement , according to the reort , with 97 per cent of them unable to demonstrate they were paying their workers enough to cover basic needs			1
only @entity21 could hold its head high			2
some companies , such as @entity26 , @entity34 , and @entity35 , rated highly in the report - but none received a mark higher then @entity21			1
companies such as @entity15 and @entity17 - which scored an ' f ' grade in all the ranked categories - are urged to raise their game			1
the industry as a whole was commended for knowing their suppliers at the final stage of production , with 49 per cent of the graded companies passing			0
should prominent business owners be taking more responsibility ? @entity14 , who founded @entity14 before selling it to @entity13 , and @entity71 , founder of @entity116 electronics , are being called on to ensure more ethical practices among their supply chains exploitation and slavery : in this ranking list , the companies were given a letter - grade , based on how well they addressed exploitation and slavery issues but , at the raw materials level of the supply chain , none of the companies had complete knowledge of where their materials were sourced and only 18 per cent had partial knowledge			1
@entity136 advocacy manager @entity135 said : ' if companies do n't know or do n't care who is producing their products , it 's much harder to know whether workers are being exploited or even enslaved			0
' @entity21 was the only company that could demonstrate its code of conduct was making a difference for workers manufacturing their products , with collective bargaining agreements in place			2
of the 39 companies , 34 per cent had codes of conduct that featured the right to collective bargaining			0
mr @entity135 said : ' the ability for workers in developing countries to organise and negotiate collectively is absolutely essential for balancing the bargaining power of employers			0
we commend @entity21 for recognising this and putting it into practice			2
' rescued child labourers in @entity162 , @entity163 ( left ) , and just one of the products they are responsible for manufacturing			0
luckily , @entity21 ( phone pictured right ) treat their workers the fairest of all 39 companies included in the report of the major @entity4 retailers that also sell their own ranges of electronic goods , @entity13 ( which stocks its own @entity50 , @entity49 , essentials , and name - brand goods ) did the best - managing to score a c + overall			1
@entity14 did only slightly worse , scoring a @entity180 fellow @entity4 electronics company @entity71 sat just below @entity14 , scoring a d - overall			0
baptist @entity183 hopes the report empowers consumers to take action			1
mr @entity135 said : ' we know that when consumers call for change , they have the power to transform the practices of companies , and through them the communities they work with			2
we â€™re excited about the impact this report will have			0
' workers in developing countries work long hours in often oppressive conditions to make the phones , tvs and tablets that we enjoy			0
the additional cost to ensure that they are rewarded for their efforts with a wage that is sufficient for them and their families to live is only a few dollars per product			0
' by some estimates , as little as two to nine dollars per smart phone or less than 1.5 per cent of the total price			0
' @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity71 , @entity21 , @entity26 , and @entity17 were unable to provide any comment .			1

@entity15 and @entity17 were the worst *offenders* , while @entity21 topped the list of companies investigated
big names @entity13 and @entity14 have room for improvement
report authors @entity20 hopes consumers will bring about change
