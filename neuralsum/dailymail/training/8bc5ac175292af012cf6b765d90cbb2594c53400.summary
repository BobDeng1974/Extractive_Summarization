published : 13:26 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 13:27 est , 7 november 2013 two physicists have produced some tips for men hoping to avoid ' splashback ' when using the toilet , by studying the physics of urinal usage			1
using high - speed videos of a stream of simulated urine , the scientists pinpointed when men are at most risk of splashback and stressed the importance of ' good technique ' when using urinals			1
their research shows reduced splash can be achieved by aiming at a vertical surface , moving closer to the urinal and by decreasing the impact angle			1
they believe most of the splashback caused by male urination is because of ' @entity28 , ' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets ( pictured at the beginning of the stream of simulated urine ) in news that will not surprise cleaners and dry cleaners , physicists @entity33 and @entity35 , who call themselves the wizz kids , said that ' significant splashback ' occurs when using a urinal			1
writing on their blog at @entity47 - based @entity46 's @entity45 , they said : ' the amount of splash is considerable and should make one reconsider standing up to urinate			1
' the scientists filmed streams of simulated urine entering a body of water similar to that of a toilet			2

they discovered the repeated impact of the stream of droplets , creates a ' large and interesting cavity with multiple ridges / mr @entity35 told the @entity66 that most of the mess caused by male urination is because of ' @entity28 , ' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets			1
' so by the time it [ the urine ] hits the urinal , it 's already in droplet form and these droplets are the perpetrators of the splash formation on your khaki pants			0
' they discovered that the repeated impact of the stream of droplets , creates a ' large and interesting cavity with multiple ridges '			0
@entity84 occurs at the point the droplets hit the surface of the water , as well as when the large cavity collapses each droplet forms a small cavity , enabling the next droplet to pass through and for a cavity of its own , creating a chain of small cavities			0

' the process repeats itself over and over , creating a real mess ' they said			0
each droplet forms a small cavity , enabling the next droplet to pass through and for a cavity of its own , creating a chain of small cavities however , after studying their videos , they discovered that reduced splash can be achieved for cleaner bathrooms , trousers and happy bathroom goers			0
in their instructions to men , they said : ' first , aim for a vertical surface rather than a horizontal one and keep away from the water bowl			2
' second , get close enough that the stream remains a stream rather than breaking up into droplets			0
' third , aim at an angle to the urinal either by aiming sideways or downward			0
' the scientists suggested that men aim for a vertical surface rather than a horizontal one and keep away from the water bowl to prevent splashback ( pictured )			1

two physicists from @entity47 - based @entity46 suggest men aim for a vertical surface and move close to the urinal to reduce splashback
the ' wizz kids ' used high - speed videos of a stream of simulated urine to work out when men are most at risk of splash back when using urinals
they said the mess caused by male urination is because of ' @entity28 , ' which means streams of falling liquid quickly turn into droplets
