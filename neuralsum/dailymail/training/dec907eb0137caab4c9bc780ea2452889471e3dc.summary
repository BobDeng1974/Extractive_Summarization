we 've all been there , you try on a ring and go to remove it only to find that it wo n't budge			1
or maybe your fingers swell , whatever the reason - a stuck ring can cause panic			0
you 're tugging and tugging and your finger is getting bluer and bluer and before you know it you 're reaching for the margerine			0
well put that butter down ! there is a new solution to avoid this rather sticky ( not to mention slimy ) situation and all you need is a piece of string			1
in the video a man helps someone remove their ring using only pliers and a piece of string with a clever trick that involves creating a spiral of string for the ring to unwind on			1
the man begins by using the pliers to get underneath the tight ring and push the string through it so it sits underneath			1
in the video the man winds the string up the finger in a tight coil ( left			2
) once he reaches the centre of the finger he tucks the loose end of string under the coil ( right ) he then continues by twisting the string around the finger towards the tip in a tight spiral until the string forms a tight coil from the base to the centre of the finger			0
he then firmly secures the string at the centre of the finger by tucking the loose end under one of the folds of string			0
then returning to the base of the finger , the man takes the start of the string and simply unwinds the tightly wound coil that has been secured to the ring , bringing it clean off the finger			2
