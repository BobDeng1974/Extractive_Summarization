@entity0 equalled the course record at the @entity20 in @entity8 to take a share of the lead @entity11 studies a putt on the 17th green as he shared the lead after two rounds of the @entity4 @entity12 also earned a share of the lead at the half - way point of the @entity4 in @entity5 after the turn he notched two more before finishing off his day in supreme style with back - to - back birdies on seven and eight before sinking an 18 - foot eagle putt on the five - par ninth			1
@entity11 put in a steady display , with a blemish - free round of 63 that was boosted by consecutive putts from more than 25 feet for birdies on the 12th and 13th holes			1
@entity41 , who was an overnight leader alongside @entity43 @entity42 , bogeyed his fifth hole of the day but recovered by picking up five shots to retain his standing at the top			1

@entity65 explained afterwards that the changes were down to a desire to boost his short game and that decision came off as he found six birdies and no bogeys			2
' when you do n't have any confidence in the short game you start playing a little bit more conservative into greens , ' he told the @entity86 website			0
' and for me that usually brings out more mistakes , so it brings out the worst in the short game , too			0
' he added : ' when i played really well at @entity92 , i was releasing the club and hitting a draw			0
' so i 'm trying to kind of get back to that a little bit more , which is kind of a tough thing to do , to go from aiming 15 yards left to now looking 15 yards right and hoping it goes the other way			0
' @entity42 takes a close look at a putt on the 11th hole at @entity7 in @entity8 storm clouds loom ominously as @entity104 's @entity103 lines up a putt on the 16th hole players cross a bridge to reach the 17th hole at the @entity7 equipment was more of a problem for @entity112 , who was disqualified for using a non-conforming club on the 18th hole			2
