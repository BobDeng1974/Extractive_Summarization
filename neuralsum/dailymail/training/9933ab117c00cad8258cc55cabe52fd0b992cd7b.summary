the @entity0 are considering bidding to host the @entity1 in 2028 , which would be the first campaign to stage a major football tournament since the 2018 @entity5 vote fiasco			1
@entity0 general secretary @entity6 , who revealed the @entity0 's ambition in @entity8 on thursday morning to dip their toes back in the murky bidding waters , has no fears that staging the climax to @entity13 would impact on @entity15 's chances			1
the final and semi-finals of @entity13 are heading for @entity18 with @entity15 overwhelming favourites to be allocated the showcase tournament games by @entity21 in @entity22 on september 18			1
but @entity36 also have strong ambitions to host @entity44 and are still considering whether to pull out of 2020 final consideration in order to concentrate on their hosting blueprint for four years later leaving @entity15 in pole position			1
@entity6 said : ' we 're really confident with our bid			2
we know what the @entity52 have been saying			2
we know that they 're thinking about 2024 , but nothing has been confirmed			0
' i 'm not going to dwell on their politics			0
i 'm expecting that they 're not going to push very hard for 2020			0
they 've made it very clear they want 2024			0
' and @entity6 added : ' i would n't rule out looking at @entity63 for a full tournament bid			1
' @entity52 football chief @entity65 said : ' we still have the two options , to host the final rounds or four matches in the group stage			2
we have a wonderful relationship with the @entity15 @entity0 , but i am totally convinced that we will have both @entity18 and @entity73 on the land map for @entity13			1
' @entity75 , especially after the feelgood factor from the @entity77 , as well as @entity78 and @entity79 are also hopeful of being allocated group matches			0
winners ! @entity82 were the last team to clinch a @entity85 title two years ago @entity86 has announced @entity15 retirement			0

@entity18 is the *stadium* of choice for the tournament
the @entity0 are hoping a bid to host the whole of @entity63 is *successful*
world champions @entity36 should prove the *sternest* competition
