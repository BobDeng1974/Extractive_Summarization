by @entity0 crime figures are likely to increase sharply following revelations about police ‘ fiddling ’ the data , mps were warned yesterday			1
the @entity7 ’s statistics watchdog revealed there has been no proper audit of the figures recorded by the police for an astonishing five years			1
the experts predict that , when the figures are thoroughly checked , it will lead to crime once again beginning to rise			1
it would be a blow to ministers who have repeatedly trumpeted that recorded crime has fallen by 10 per cent since the @entity20 came to power			1
latest revelations : the @entity23 has revealed there has not been a proper audit of police crime figures for five years after withdrawing its stamp of approval on police crime figures in the year to june last year , recorded crime was down by 5 per cent			1
the figures are 38 per cent lower than 2002 - 03			0
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) also said they wanted to check there are no problems with other government data			2
figures on the likes of ambulance response times and @entity39 waiting times are also likely to come under renewed scrutiny			0
last week the @entity42 told how , in an extraordinary move , the @entity23 had stripped the police ’s recorded crime figures of their ‘ gold standards ’ status			1
the watchdog said there was increasing evidence that the data was ‘ unreliable ’			1
a string of serving and ex-senior police officers have admitted to concerns that forces have been ‘ fiddling ’ the figures			2
warning : mps have been told that crime statistics are likely to rise after a proper audit has been conducted of police figures yesterday , @entity23 head sir @entity62 expressed regret the watchdog had not highlighted major problems with the information earlier			1
he told @entity67 ’s @entity66 : ‘ it is quite conceivable , indeed i think quite likely , that if there is proper auditing introduced , the recording of crime is improved , that we will see recorded crime increase			2
’ sir @entity62 said there had been inadequate auditing since 2007 - 8 , and statisticians had been voicing concerns for years			0
@entity80 , head of crime statistics at the @entity82 , said some police appeared to be ‘ confused ’ about whether offences should be recorded if there was not enough evidence to bring a charge			1
crime prevention minister @entity88 has admitted there is a ' dent ' in public confidence in police data in his own evidence to mps , crime prevention minister @entity88 accepted that there was a ‘ dent ’ in public confidence in the police data			1
but he insisted : ‘ i do n’t accept that the @entity99 has any interest in manipulating figures			0
we have no interest in having figures that do not tell us the truth			0
’ he added : ‘ i still hold to the view that there is not an endemic problem in the sense that there is a deliberate attempt across forces to massage figures ’			0
but @entity115 mp @entity114 insisted ministers should be more ‘ repentant ’ about the ‘ mathematical gymnastics ’ that had been taking place , claiming there had been ‘ a remarkable capacity for self - delusion ’			0
the next set of quarterly crime statistics is due tomorrow			2
@entity66 chairman @entity124 accused the @entity99 of ‘ complacency ’			0
and he warned @entity127 mayor @entity126 and 13 crime commissioners who have set their forces local targets to reduce their recorded crime figures to make sure this does not lead them to chase targets rather than to cut crime			1
in previous evidence to mps , police told how politically sensitive crimes had been reclassified			2
for example , a burglary might be called criminal damage to downplay its significance			0
some offences are recorded as ‘ no crime ’			0
a victim may not be able to prove their mobile phone was stolen so it is logged as ‘ lost ’			0
the @entity82 ( graph showing crime levels since 1981 , pictured ) has already said police records ' appear to overstate the rate at which crime has been falling '			0

@entity23 has withdrawn its approval of police crime figures
the statistics watchdog said there is evidence crime figures are ' unreliable '
it has now revealed there was no proper audit of police figures for 5 years
mps have been warned that crime figures will now rise after a proper audit
prediction is a blow to ministers who have claimed crime has fallen 10 *%*
