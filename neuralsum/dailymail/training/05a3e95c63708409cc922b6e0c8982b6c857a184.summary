by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 29 may 2012 a three - year - old boy left paralysed after being struck down by a rare immune disorder has made an amazing recovery			1
as @entity6 - then two - lay in hospital , his parents were warned he might never walk again			1
but the toddler stunned doctors by fighting back and taking his first steps			1
full recovery : @entity6 , pictured with his parents @entity11 and @entity13 , was left paralysed after being struck down by rare immune disorder @entity14 his mother @entity15 , 35 , said : ' my biggest fear was him not recovering and being paralysed for the rest of his life			1
' to look at him now , you would n’t know how ill he was			1
he has fought through it			2
' he ’s a miracle			2
that ’s the only way i can describe it			2
' @entity6 was paralysed from the neck down after falling ill in february last year			1
@entity14 - pronounced @entity27 - is a rare serious disease of the peripheral nervous system , a nerve network that controls the body 's movements			1
the body 's immune system attacks these nerves causing inflammation			2
this causes pins and needles and can lead to temporary paralysis			2
around one in four will need a ventilator to help with breathing but most recover between a few weeks and a few months			2
around 1,500 people in the @entity45 develop the condition each year			2
the exact cause is unknown but more than half of sufferers have a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before they develop the syndrome			2
mrs @entity15 and her husband @entity13 , 40 , from @entity53 , @entity54 , first realised something was wrong when their son started limping			2
the couple took him to their local gp who thought he might have an infection in his hip and referred him to @entity65 in @entity66			2
@entity6 was kept in hospital for a couple of days while doctors ran tests , which came back clear			1
they then thought a virus could be to blame and @entity6 was allowed home , but his parents soon took him back in after his limp worsened			1
mrs @entity15 said : ' he was refusing to sit or stand and was crying out in pain			2
' he was up all night screaming and very uncooperative			2
he was shouting : " get off me "			0
we did n’t know what it was			0
' doctors were baffled and ran a succession of further tests over the next week			1
an mri scan and a painful lumbar puncture revealed @entity6 had @entity14 , a disorder where the body ’s immune system attacks the nervous system by mistake			1
his parents , who kept a vigil at their son ’s bedside , were warned the disorder could be life threatening if his breathing muscles became affected			1
poor outlook : as @entity6 - then two - lay in hospital , his parents were warned he might never walk again immediately , doctors have @entity6 a high dose of immunoglobulin to reduce the attack on his nervous system but his condition deteriorated until he was paralysed from the neck down			1
for seven weeks , he could not move and would not eat , causing him to rapidly lose weight			0
mrs @entity15 said : ' he was very weak			0
he could n’t even hold his head up			0
' i kept thinking why was it happening to us ? it was devastating			0
i was shattered by it			0
' i asked the medical staff if he would walk again and they would n’t answer me			1
i tried not to be negative but i knew that was n’t a good sign			0
' i was frightened he would be paralysed for the rest of his life			0
' @entity6 was in so much pain he needed the strongest dose of painkillers allowed for a child of his age			1
mrs @entity15 said : ' he was in and out of sleep			0
they were pumping painkillers into him			0
it gave him half an hour of relief then he started screaming again			0
' he would n’t let us touch him			0
it was awful not being able to hold and comfort my child			0
' @entity130 : @entity6 , pictured with his older sister @entity131 , amazed doctors by making a full recovery after a second course of treatment , @entity6 slowly started to respond and he moved for the first time			1
his mother said : ' one day , he brought his hand up to reach his toy dog			0
it was just a huge relief			0
' with the help of intense physiotherapy , @entity6 finally regained enough strength to leave hospital and go home to be with his parents and four - year - old sister @entity131			1
he still could not walk or sit up unaided and continued to have rehabilitation at home and in the hospital			1
mrs @entity15 , who is an occupational therapist , said : ' he was like a seven - month - old baby			0
we had to back through every single milestone			1
' we never knew if he was going to do it			0
it was an emotional rollercoaster			0
i was in tears the first time he walked			0
' we really pushed him			0
i did whatever therapy i could to make him better			0
' now , a year on after his life - threatening battle with the disorder , @entity6 is back to full health and has started nursery			1
mrs @entity15 said : ' today , @entity6 is like a normal little boy			1
he ’s always running around and loves playing on his scooter			0
' i look back at the photos all the time			1
@entity6 does n’t remember it but i ’ll show them to him when he ’s older			1
it ’s important for him to know and understand			0
' it shows his strength of character			0
