police discovered @entity4 's remains at the flat in leafy @entity7 , west @entity9 , in february 2010 after receiving a tip - off			1
the 53 - year - old 's body had been bound with tape and wrapped in a duvet cover before being buried under the concrete patio			2
at the time , flat owner @entity23 , 52 , was a terminally ill patient at the @entity24 in @entity25 , south @entity9			1
police interviewed him at the hospice and on the fourth occasion ' he admitted he had in fact killed the man we discovered under the concrete area			2
he named that man as mr @entity4 ' , detective sergeant , @entity33 , said			2
mr @entity23 has since died			1
following the tip - off , police began a search of the garden using methods such as radar			2
they discovered the remains at the back of the house under a level of concrete			0
@entity46 told @entity47 : ' the concrete was lifted			0
the search team dug approximately a foot - and - a - half under the soil			0
' the first we discovered was an area of underlay which had been rolled			0
the underlay was exposed where we found what appeared to be a duvet cover			0
under the duvet cover were several wrapped bags which covered several remains			0
' mr @entity23 ' claimed he had strangled @entity4 ' , he added , but he died 13 days later and police were able to follow up investigations with him			1
however , he was under the care of a psychiatrist before his death and had anger management issues and a ' compulsion to blame other people for his own failures			0
' the inquest heard mr @entity4 , who was born in @entity72 and is believed to have been unemployed when he died , had last been seen on january 12 , 1998 , during a doctor 's appointment			1
upmarket : police found mr @entity4 's remains under the patio of the flat in @entity7 , @entity9 , owned by @entity23 , who then confessed to strangling mr @entity4 in 1998 it was discovered that he had three sisters living in @entity82 and one in @entity84 , but officers were not able to get enough dna from them to forensically confirm the skeleton belonged to mr @entity4			1
however , gp records showed he had complained to his doctor of back pain and the forensic anthropologist found evidence to fit this on the skeleton			2
police also showed photographs of the clothing found on the skeleton to a friend who had reported him missing and ' when he was shown a picture of the hat , he burst into tears			2
' he was adamant that the hat we had shown him was that belonging to mr @entity4 ' , @entity46 said , and the clothing mr @entity4 was said to have been wearing was similar to that found on the skeleton			1
@entity108 , dr @entity109 , told the inquest the body was in the foetal position and adhesive tape was wrapped around his ankles			0
due to the length of time the body had been left , he said , ' regrettably the cause of death is given as unascertained			0
' recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity120 , said : ' i think on account that there was an unlawful burial , it raises the issue of suspicion and makes it more likely that the cause of death is an unnatural one			1
' from all the circumstances in which it was found , it is more likely to have been criminally mediated			0
' there was ' some reliability ' to be placed on what mr @entity23 claimed had happened , she said , adding : ' all i can say is i am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this was an unlawful killing			1
' at the time two people were arrested and bailed on suspicion of murder , but no charges were ever brought .			0
