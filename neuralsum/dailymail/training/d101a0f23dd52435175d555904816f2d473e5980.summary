by @entity0 @entity1 has unveiled a music streaming service for its prime members in a bid to take on @entity7 and @entity8 's recently purchased @entity6 service			1
the prime music service is another addition to the giant 's popular free - shipping plan , and is expected to feature heavily on its first smartphone , set to be unveiled next week			2
it will offer more than a million tracks for ad - free streaming and download to @entity19 tablets as well as to computers and the @entity22 app for @entity8 and @entity24 devices			1
the service will feature over a million tracks			2
however , @entity1 failed to reach a deal with @entity27 , so artists such as @entity29 ( pictured ) , @entity30 and @entity31 will not be available @entity32 - based @entity1 reached licensing deals with most of the top independent labels and major recording companies @entity36 and @entity37 , but failed to reach a deal with top - ranked @entity27			1
that means that while the service will feature artists like @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 — it will lack music by @entity27 stars such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 - @entity50 people who pay $ 99 a year for @entity52 can listen to tens of thousands of albums from artists including @entity55 , the @entity56 and @entity57 for no extra cost			1
by adding music , @entity1 is hoping to hook new customers and retain existing ones on its prime free - shipping plan , which also allows subscribers to watch streams of movies and tv shows and gives @entity19 owners a library of books they can borrow once a month			1
@entity70 , @entity1 's vice president of digital music , said the service will pay for itself and is n't part of the reason why the company raised the price of @entity52 from $ 79 in march — a move @entity1 said would cover higher shipping costs			2
instead , the company will benefit because prime members tend to buy more from @entity1 and remain loyal customers			2
' if they come to @entity1 for their music needs , they become better and longer - term @entity1 customers and we think that 's a good thing , ' @entity70 said			2
@entity32 - based @entity1 reached licensing deals with most of the top independent labels and major recording companies @entity36 and @entity37 , but failed to reach a deal with top - ranked @entity27			1
that means that while the service will feature artists like @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 — it will lack music by @entity27 stars such as @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 - @entity50 the service will be available on @entity19 tablets as well as to computers and the @entity22 app for @entity8 and @entity24 devices			1
the service also wo n't have many new releases — and for major artists that could mean music that has been released within the last six months			0
@entity27 did n't reach a deal with @entity1 because it disagreed with the value of the lump sum royalty payment on offer for the albums in question , according to two people familiar with the matter			1
one person said the royalty amounted to about $ 40 million to $ 50 million for the entire music industry over two years			0
the prime music service also has hand picked playlists labels other than @entity27 concluded the amount would be equal to or better than a per - play streaming royalty , given how often the songs were played on other digital services , the person said			1
both people were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the deal comes on the heels of @entity8 's announcement that it is purchasing headphone and music - streaming company beats for $ 3 billion and is a further acknowledgement of the rise in popularity of streaming and the decline of digital downloads			1
artists including @entity55 , the @entity56 and @entity57 will be available on the service @entity139 sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $ 2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $ 1.4 billion , according to the @entity142			2
early results this year showed a further decline in music download sales , @entity70 said			0
' music consumption habits are changing , which is why we started this , ' he said			0
' we saw the change happening			0
' @entity1 will recommend songs to customers who have bought music from it in the past with offers to complete albums if they 're available on the service			0
it has also hired experts to compile hundreds of playlists that are 20 to 50 songs in length based on genre or mood that are easy to download before getting on the subway or on a plane , @entity70 said			0
@entity164 , managing partner of market research company @entity165 , said that while the offering falls short of what 's available on $ 10 - a - month music subscription plans like @entity7 or @entity170 , it may be enough for @entity52 subscribers to discover they can enjoy an album or two for free			0
" if you 're a young person and really a superfan all about discovering new music , this probably is n't for you			0
that 's ok , there 's enough of the rest of us , " he said .			0
