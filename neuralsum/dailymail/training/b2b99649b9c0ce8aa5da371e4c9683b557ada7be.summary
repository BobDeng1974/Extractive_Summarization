by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 11 april 2013 police dogs have been fitted with state - of - the - art cameras so they can record themselves apprehending criminals			2
the technology also allows officers to check out a building from the dogs ' perspective to make sure it is safe before they enter it themselves			1
police met at the @entity14 and @entity15 firearms training centre near @entity16 to test the new body @entity17 on their animals			0
as well as providing video which can be played back later and used as a record of missions , the devices can beam back live video to officers			1
@entity49 @entity12 have been working with manufacturer @entity51 @entity50 since january last year to develop the more practical cameras to help in police searchers and other serious incidents			1
the result was the @entity56 , an armed response kit comprising the back - mounted @entity24 , a long - pole camera with a 20ft reach , and monitors so handlers and tactical advisors can see the images			1
development : the camera and associated devices were invented by @entity51 @entity50 @entity67 : an officer poses with his dog wearing the @entity24 at the training centre this week comfortable : the dogs are accustomed to the back - mounted camera than a head - mounted one the gear has already been used at a number of firearms and other high - risk incidents in the @entity78			1
@entity80 @entity79 , one of the force 's dog handlers , said that the equipment was a great improvement on the head - mounted cameras they used to put on the dogs			1
' this camera - as opposed to the last camera - is mounted on the dog 's back , ' he said			2
' and because dogs when they 're tracking or searching normally wear a harness anyway , they 're very , very comfortable with something being on their back			2
' whereas a head - mounted unit , although it was very good , it was a big ask of a dog to wear it for a long period of time without interfering with it			0
' perspective : the view from one of the cameras attached to a dog 's back in the training facility dry run : this video footage is broadcast live to the dog 's handler and other officers on standby suspect : the police dog apprehending a dummy made to look like a potential criminal inspector @entity121 added : ' this is something that is readily available so it is part of our armed response vehicle , so if there 's a firearms job or a high - risk person missing from home , we do not need to have it brought to us			2
' it fits on the body of the dog , rather than the headcams we had before , where we had to use quite a mature dog			0
' it also means we do n't have to put up cordons , empty houses and close of roads			0
' we have the public , officers and other emergency services who we must safeguard first and we can send them in and clear the area			0
' the dog that we have got have all taken to it and there 's been no adverse reactions to it - it 's light and on a harness that they wear , so the dogs have seen some benefit			0
' live stream : a policeman watches the feed from the camera as his dog explores inside a building useful : the device could obviate the need to cordon off roads and police animals are sent in first experiment : the tests pictured here took place at the training centre near @entity16 in @entity49			0
