for millions a strong coffee is the perfect start to the day			2
but today , new research suggests coffee could also protect against dementia			0
drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing alzheimer 's disease by up to 20 per cent , scientists said			1
nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills , especially during the phase of alzheimer 's disease before symptoms of dementia occur			2
this is according to a report published by the @entity18 , who are funded by major @entity21 coffee companies such as @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			0
however , experts from leading charities @entity26 and @entity28 today warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent @entity32 's , because no clinical trials have been carried out			1
the new report presents new research explaining how diet can affect the development of the disease			0
a @entity58 diet , consisting of fish , fresh fruit and vegetables , olive oil and red wine , has been associated with a reduced risk for development of alzheimer 's disease , it argued			2
research suggests that compounds called polyphenols are responsible for this protective effect ; compounds also found in high quantities in coffee			2
other studies cited in the report found regular , life - long moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
dr @entity78 , vice chairman of @entity79 , said : ' the findings presented in this report are very encouraging			0
' coffee is a very popular beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world and i 'm pleased to know that moderate , lifelong consumption can have a beneficial effect on the development of alzheimer 's disease			2
' cognitive decline is a feature of ageing , and although some changes can be expected in all of us , there is some evidence that diet and lifestyle may be related to cognition			0
' a recent study , suggested that moderate coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia over a four year follow - up period , however the effect diminished over longer follow up period			2
caffeine helps prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrulary tangles in the brain - two hallmarks of @entity32 , it said			1
in addition to this , both caffeine and polyphenols reduce inflammation and decrease the deterioration of brain cells - especially in the hippocampus and cortex , areas of the brain involved in memory			1
the report , released by the @entity18 , suggested that moderate coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of developing dementia over a four year period ( file picture ) dr @entity130 , from the @entity131 , presented his findings at the symposium			0
he said : ' the majority of human epidemiological studies suggest that regular coffee consumption over a lifetime is associated with a reduced risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , with an optimum protective effect occurring with three to five cups of coffee per day			1
' but dr @entity143 , of @entity26 , the @entity145 's leading dementia research charity , said clinical trials are needed to prove a link between drinking coffee and a reduced risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
he said : ' although some studies have suggested a possible link between coffee consumption and lower dementia risk , there is currently not enough evidence to be able to draw firm conclusions about its effects			0
' many studies that have investigated these links have been observational studies , which are not able to tell us definitively whether coffee can prevent or reduce the risk of @entity32 's			1
' while many of us enjoy a cup of coffee now and again , we 'd need to see clinical trials to know whether the drink could prevent alzheimer 's disease			1
' with half a million people currently living with @entity32 's in the @entity145 and that number set to increase , we must invest in research to find ways of preventing the disease			1
' in the meantime , current evidence suggests that we can lower our risk by eating a healthy , balanced diet , doing regular exercise , not smoking , and keeping blood pressure and weight in check			0
' @entity184 , of @entity28 , echoed comments that the evidence is not conclusive			0
she said : ' the evidence is not conclusive that drinking coffee will help to protect against alzheimer 's disease			2
' some research suggests that caffeine and antioxidants in coffee may be beneficial but studies in people show mixed results - more research and clinical trials are needed to see if positive effects occur in people over the long term			0
' there is no single way to reduce your risk of dementia			0
' exercising frequently , as well as eating a healthy balanced diet , avoiding smoking , not drinking in excess , and managing other health conditions can play a role in reducing your risk of dementia			0
' meanwhile professor @entity213 , professor of neuroscience , @entity215 , added : ' this type of study needs both replication and assessment for the possibility / probability of confounding variables to do with other aspects of lifestyle			0
' the report also highlighted the role nutrition can play in preserving cognitive function , especially during the pre-clinical phase of @entity32 's , before symptoms of dementia occur			1
it found that a @entity58 diet , consisting of fish , fresh fruit and vegetables , olive oil and red wine , has been associated with a reduced risk of developing @entity32 's			1
the research and key findings were originally presented at the @entity241 in @entity242 last month before being officially released today			0
@entity32 's affects one person in 20 over the age of 65 , amounting to 26 million people worldwide			1
in @entity145 alone , 850,000 people are affected by dementia , with 60 per cent of those suffering from @entity32 's			1
the report was presented at the @entity241 in @entity242 .			0

study found drinking up to five cups a day could cut chance of @entity32 's
researchers said caffeine helps prevent formation in brain linked to illness
also helps reduce inflammation and decrease deterioration of brain cells
