a modified exhaust tested by @entity2 in @entity3 has failed to make the new cars sound any louder , @entity0 claimed on wednesday			1
the noise produced by this season 's 1.6 - litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution			1
mercedes , who supply engines to four teams on the grid , have led the development process in cooperation with the @entity21 and under @entity23 's insistence			1
but the @entity42 revealed afterwards that the tail pipe , which had been widened in order to create more volume , failed to do so			0
' it was n't a great solution , ' @entity0 said said in a video posted on @entity48			1
' it just did n't work			1
it did n't make it much louder			0
so we 'll just have to look for another solution			0
' the season 's dominant team , runaway winners of all five races so far , had agreed to try out the trumpet - like device to try and pump up the volume after complaints that the new @entity62 hybrid cars were too quiet compared to the old @entity64 screamers			0
life in the fast lane : pastor @entity67 topped the timesheets after a difficult weekend in @entity3 the softer sound provided an immediate controversy when the season started in @entity72 in march with some race promoters , who met in @entity75 on saturday , fearing ticket sales could fall off if fans were alienated by the lack of decibels			2
others in favour of the quieter new era argue that increasing the noise goes against the greener spirit of the regulation changes , which reduce wasted energy from the exhaust and brakes and harness it to improve fuel economy			2
' it 's an interesting moment in time for @entity92 , ' @entity2 motorsport head @entity90 said last weekend			0
' traditionally you would have said ... that @entity92 needs to be loud to be spectacular			0
maybe now that 's changing			0
' while the noise , or lack of it , was a talking point on wednesday others got on with their regular business			0
@entity101 action : @entity102 was testing for @entity103 ahead of her grand prix debut at @entity105 later this year job done : the @entity108 driver was fifth fastest in @entity75 on wednesday @entity109 had quadruple champion @entity110 in their car while @entity113 pastor @entity67 topped the fairly meaningless timesheets with @entity115			1
@entity103 had @entity102 getting acquainted with their car before she becomes the first female driver since 1992 to feature in a grand prix weekend when she takes part in practice at @entity105 in july			2
she was fifth fastest and completed 55 laps			1
@entity123 reserve @entity122 had his first drive of a @entity92 car and completed enough laps with @entity127 to secure the superlicence he will need if a race seat comes his way .			2
