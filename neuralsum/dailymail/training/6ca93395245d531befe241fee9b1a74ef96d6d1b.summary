by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 so the @entity3 obsession with @entity4 continues			1
it 's as if a load of @entity8 - playing so - called football fans have discovered an alien species			0
a player who fundamentally stays in one place on the field , and shifts the ball about relying not on pace or physical strength , but on spatial awareness and control of the football			0
these @entity3 ' @entity19 ' think he comes from another planet			0
of course the suave appearance , the masterful beard , and the ' could n’t give a f * * * ' autobiography all help add to the mystery and attraction of this @entity28 @entity27 - figure			0
he ’d soon have come off with a strained calf or broken bootlace			0
we respected @entity4 far too much on saturday , when it should have been our chance to put him in his place after that disrespectful chipped penalty in the shoot - out at @entity57			1
remember @entity59 ’s contorted face after burying that spot - kick in 1996 , 6 years on from the pain of missing from the spot at @entity63 ? remember @entity64 slamming in that penalty in 2002 against @entity65 after the injustice of the red card in @entity68 four years earlier ? that was revenge , that was redemption			0
@entity72 running at @entity4 and nutmegging him , or @entity73 leaving a foot in to upset – not injure – the @entity28 , upsetting him so much he wants to get off the field			1
that ’s what @entity39 should have done			2
more of this : @entity39 showed @entity4 too much respect and should have closed him down , as @entity81 did must do better : @entity72 could have run at @entity82 and @entity73 should have closed him down instead we stood off him , and a load of dreamy - eyes glossed over back home at this @entity31 legend			1
' if only we had him , ' the @entity3 teenagers cried			0
' @entity39 have never produced a player like that , ' said the older generation			2
' he dummied the ball ! did you see that ? he actually dummied the ball ! ' screamed a gaggle of @entity99 groupies who have probably never been to a game of any level in @entity39 in their lives			1
the @entity3 obsession with all things foreign takes over yet again			0
oh , if only we could produce a precious @entity4			2
the sad thing is @entity3 football did produce a @entity4			2
his name is @entity109 and after being left out of @entity44 ’s squad this summer he will end his career having played in just one game at a @entity99 finals			1
we won it 1 - 0			0
@entity115 appearance : @entity109 's only @entity99 appearance came against @entity118 in 2006 other plans : @entity109 has been holidaying this summer after he was overlooked for a place at the @entity99 i do n’t know if @entity109 would have had as good an international career as @entity4 , but i do know the job he did in a very successful @entity125 side under sir @entity126 for many seasons			1
all these @entity39 managers felt they knew better than sir @entity126			2
it ’s all about opinions , and i ’d probably conclude @entity4 is a better player than @entity109			1
but if @entity39 had used him in their midfield instead of messing around trying to use @entity134 and @entity135 together , we may have been more successful			2
anyone scoffing at this ca n’t prove me wrong			0
if you love @entity4 , you ’ll appreciate what @entity109 has done for @entity125 all these years			1
if you ca n’t see the connection , then @entity3 football ’s problems run worryingly deep			0
@entity144 : @entity109 has been an almost ever - present at the heart of the @entity125 midfield			1

@entity39 gave @entity4 far too much respect in @entity41
@entity73 should have closed him down and put him off his game
@entity72 could have sold him a nutmeg
@entity154 produce their own @entity4 - @entity109
the @entity125 midfielder has played one game at a @entity99
