in @entity1 , this will not have gone down well			0
in @entity4 , @entity3 , they wo n’t be too thrilled either			0
@entity6 ’s decision to keep @entity7 in @entity8 rather than release him to fulfil an obligation to their feeder club @entity10 has been received predictably badly in the @entity11			1
at a stroke the @entity13 champions have undermined the very credibility of their @entity17 project and alienated a customer base they have desperately been trying to court			0
here on our side of the @entity21 , though , @entity7 has simply proved too valuable to lose and it was perhaps to be expected that he would play a defining role in his first appearance since his decision to remain at @entity6 until the end of the season was announced late on @entity28			1
man of the match : @entity43			0
attendance : 45,367 this was the elaborate build - up to @entity43 's opener for @entity6 - click here for all the stats and heat maps in our @entity94 service what @entity4 manager @entity96 thinks now of his own decision to release @entity7 last summer only he will know			1
what is beyond doubt , though , is that the 36 - year - old has already played a significant part in shaping the landscape of this @entity13 season			2
back in september @entity7 scored his first @entity6 goal to hold @entity4 to a 1 - 1 draw here			1
on @entity106 he scored his fifth in the league after coming off the substitutes ’ bench to rescue his team when calamity beckoned for the second home game running			0
having scored twice through @entity43 and @entity64 to lead in the second half , @entity6 were inexplicably pegged back by a @entity34 team that had spent much of the afternoon showing absolutely no attacking intent at all			1
but @entity7 ’s headed goal from a @entity44 cross with 15 minutes to go was straight from the back catalogue			1
it was born of technique , timing and anticipation and perhaps it was only to be expected			0
having thrown away two points so carelessly here against @entity127 at the weekend , @entity6 certainly needed something from this			0
@entity29 did his best to bring some freshness to his team , resting goalkeeper @entity61 and rotating a number of other positions			0
interestingly , @entity7 began the afternoon on the bench			0
@entity64 doubled @entity6 's advantage after 66 minutes with a cheeky flick from @entity44 's cross from the right @entity64 celebrates with @entity54 ( left ) and @entity43 after doubling @entity6 's advantage midway through the second - half @entity43 slides on his knees to celebrate his thunderbolt goal to give @entity6 the lead after 56 minutes the @entity143 midfielder rifled home from outside the box to break the deadlock 11 minutes into the second perio @entity34 's @entity45 ( left ) and @entity70 react with dismay as @entity43 scores @entity6 's opening goal for almost an hour , however , @entity6 toiled			1
@entity34 came to @entity150 determined to frustrate the champions by setting up camp on the edge of their penalty area			2
given the attacking talent they have available , one would have expected @entity6 to break through but it was only in the last half hour of the game that they found something of their true selves			2
prior to that , @entity6 were very average indeed , looking just as leggy and short of ideas as they had last time out			0
in the first half , precious little of note actually happened			0
@entity43 – back in the team after being rested at the weekend – saw one shot blocked by a sea of red and white bodies while @entity54 drove the follow - up wide			2
@entity54 himself then had a shot saved on the half an hour , as did @entity43 from the edge of the area moments later			2
it was @entity34 , however , who came closest to scoring as @entity72 brought a full length save from @entity180 with a right foot free - kick			2
at this stage referee @entity83 was n’t winning any friends at the @entity184 with some decisions that angered the @entity6 faithful and the usually phlegmatic @entity29			0
@entity6 , though , were not helping themselves			0
their football lacked real quality and , unusually , their discipline was sketchy too			0
in to the second half , though , and @entity43 eventually scored to bring the game to life			1
some goal it was , too , as @entity64 laid the ball back to @entity43 and the big @entity143 drove it high past former @entity6 goalkeeper @entity33 from 20 yards			1
in to the second half , though , and @entity43 eventually scored to bring the game to life			1
some goal it was , too , as @entity64 laid the ball back to @entity43 and the big @entity143 drove it high past former @entity6 goalkeeper @entity33 from 20 yards			1
city forward @entity64 rises above the @entity34 defence to get off a header - but it did n't find the net on this occasion @entity54 ( right ) fires off a shot through a crowd of @entity34 defenders as @entity6 searched for a goal during the first - half @entity54 finds himself in a @entity38 and @entity68 sandwich during a first - half duel @entity43 remonstrates with referee @entity83 after a decision goes against @entity6 during the first 45 @entity34 's @entity75 ( second right ) attempts to reach the ball ahead of @entity6 's @entity218 @entity52 @entity7 's 176th @entity13 goal takes him clear of @entity220 and into fourth place in the division ’s all - time top scorers chart			1
it really was a special goal and it set the tone for the rest of the afternoon			0
moments later @entity6 were two ahead and seemingly home and hosed			0
@entity64 laid the ball off to @entity44 down the left and then made terrific ground in to the penalty area to nudge the ensuing low cross in to the corner with an elaborate flick			1
just as they did on sunday , @entity6 looked comfortable and @entity34 ’s race – such as it was – seemed run			2
once again , though , the hosts faltered and moments after @entity239 ran clear to hit the post @entity34 hot back to score two goals in three minutes , both coming from former @entity6 players			1
city striker @entity64 reaches the ball ahead of @entity34 defender @entity45 inside the penalty box @entity6 's @entity52 ( left ) and @entity34 's @entity45 compete for a 50 - 50 ball during the first - half @entity6 's midfield general @entity43 barges into @entity34 's @entity35 as he tries to steal possession @entity6 's @entity54 controls the ball with the outside of his boot as he tries to outmanoeuvre @entity34 's @entity38 @entity49 , who lined up wearing a protective headband , reaches the bouncing ball just ahead of @entity34 's @entity35 @entity6 manager @entity29 issues instructions from his technical area as the rain pours down at the @entity184 first holding midfield player @entity38 leapt above @entity44 at a corner to head in to the far corner and then @entity35 buried a penalty after @entity49 had felled @entity34 full back @entity69 rather like a lumberjack would fell a tree			1
with just over a quarter of an hour to go , @entity6 were facing embarrassment and frustration for the second time in just a few days			0
this time , though , @entity7 emerged to rescue them			0
the 36 - year - old had only been on the field four minutes when he drifted in to the box off @entity68 ’s shoulder to head @entity44 ’s cross down and in to the corner , the ball brushing the post as it went in			1
it was a classic @entity7 moment and one that showed why @entity6 have risked such a pr disaster in @entity11 in order to keep him			2
the @entity13 is all that matters here and @entity7 would appear to have a role to play between now and may , whether the good folk of @entity1 like it or not			2
@entity49 and @entity75 leap to contest an aerial ball during the first - half of the contest @entity239 has his shirt tugged by @entity34 's @entity69 as he tries to break down the flank in the first - half at the @entity184 @entity75 attempts to weave his way past @entity52 ( left ) and @entity49 as @entity34 go on the offensive @entity6 's @entity49 gets beyond @entity34 winger @entity35 to deliver a cross during the opening stages of the match @entity7 started on the bench after agreeing that his loan spell from @entity17 side @entity10 would be extended until may @entity7 warms up for @entity6 after it was confirmed his loan spell from sister club @entity1 will be extended			1

@entity6 have drawn level on point with @entity4 at @entity13 summit after 3 - 2 win over @entity34
@entity7 headed the winner from a @entity44 cross after 73 minutes to secure precious win
after poor first - half , @entity6 led when @entity43 rifled home from outside the penalty box
the lead was doubled on 66 minutes when @entity64 flicked home a low @entity44 ball
@entity34 halved the deficit when @entity38 headed home on 68 minutes against former club
and the @entity34 drew level at 2 - 2 when @entity35 scored penalty after @entity49 fouled @entity69
