by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 05:39 est , 11 september 2012 an @entity3 hospital trust losing £ 1m a week has been put into administration to try and stop it collapsing , the @entity1 said today			2
health secretary @entity6 has appointed a trust special administrator to try and turn around the struggling @entity8			1
the trust is in danger of following the @entity11 , which runs three hospitals including @entity13 in @entity14 ( pictured ) and was put under the charge of a special administrator for being on the brink of bankruptcy mr @entity6 said : ' i have decided it is in the interests of the health service and , in particular , of the patients the @entity8 serves			1
' the trust has been put on an ' unsustainable providers regime ' and the government has appointed @entity27 with the task of putting it back on a ' viable footing			0
' mr @entity27 currently works as the national director for provider delivery at the @entity1			0
he will take over the @entity8 's board on monday july 16 and recommend measures to mr @entity6 at the start of next year			1
the chairs and directors have been informed that they have been suspended from board duties			0
it is the first time in @entity3 history that a trust has been forced to hand over its administration powers to the @entity1 after failing to meet prescribed standards			0
new appointment : @entity27 is the special administrator tasked with sorting out the trust the @entity8 was only created in 2009 after the merger of three hospitals - the princess royal in @entity49 , @entity50 's in @entity51 and the @entity13 in @entity14			1
yet it has gone £ 150million in the red over the past three years largely because of crippling @entity54 deals agreed by the last @entity56 government			1
the two @entity54 deals are now costing £ 61million a year in interest			1
last year 's deficit , paid off by money from elsewhere in the @entity3 budget , could have paid for 1,200 nurses or 200 hip replacements a week			2
the health secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of between £ 30million and £ 75million a year for the next five years , despite efforts to tackle the situation			1
today he said : ' past efforts have not succeeded in putting the @entity11 on a sustainable path			0
' this will be a big challenge and my key objective for all @entity77 is to ensure they deliver high - quality services to patients that are clinically and financially sustainable for the long term			2
' the purpose of the trust special administrator is to ensure that services are high quality and to ensure a lasting clinical and financial solution			0
health secretary @entity6 said the ground - breaking decision was in the interest of patients ' although there have been some improvements in mortality rates , maternity services and infection control , and some early signs of improvements in waiting times , they do not go far enough			1
it will be impossible for @entity100 to build on these improvements while tackling such a large deficit			0
' @entity27 , working with clinicians , all other staff , commissioners , patients , the public and other stakeholders , must now drive the changes and shape a sustainable solution for @entity8 and the local health economy			1
' i am confident that with the regime i am enacting today in place , and working extensively with clinicians , health service leaders , patients and local people , @entity27 will have the tools and framework in place to find a long - term satisfactory solution for the people of south east @entity100			1
' mr @entity27 will first publish a report on october 29 after examining the @entity8 's long - standing difficulties			1
he will then launch a 30 - day consultation with staff , patients and public on a draft report			2
a final report will be sent to mr @entity6 on january 8 , 2013			0
mr @entity27 said : ' my priority is to work with staff , patients , the public and all those involved in healthcare services in the south east @entity100 area to maintain high quality , effective services during the running of the @entity139			2
' this means developing recommendations that ensure that people in south east @entity100 can access high quality , safe , and financially sustainable @entity3 services for the long - term			0
' together we will need to think differently , be bold and accept that change needs to happen			0
the status quo is not sustainable			0
' a spokesman for the @entity150 , said : ' this announcement is an unprecedented step by the secretary of state and moves the @entity3 into unchartered waters			0
' it presents a worrying state of affairs for both patients and staff at the @entity8 , who will be undoubtedly concerned by today ’s decision			1
' we know that the @entity8 has been in financial difficulties for some time			2
however , despite this , frontline staff have continued to do their best for patients , providing a high level of care			0

health secretary says the ground - breaking decision is in the interest of patients
@entity8 is struggling to *pay* off @entity56 - agreed @entity54 deals costing £ 61m a year in interest
