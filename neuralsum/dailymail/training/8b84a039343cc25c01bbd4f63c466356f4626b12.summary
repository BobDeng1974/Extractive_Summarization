from the wildflowers that dot the crumbling slag heaps of south @entity3 to the elegant lines of the vast industrial chimneys of the @entity6 , there 's a strange beauty in the remnants of the @entity10 's industrial past			2
and no - one knows it better than @entity13 , the @entity15 film director turned photographer , whose haunting shots of crumbling factories are the subject of a new exhibition			1
the factory photographs , which were taken between 1980 and 2000 , include brooding shots of power plants and the decaying corners of abandoned manufacturing plants			1
haunting : a brooding photo of a power plant belching steam taken in the late 1980s in the north of @entity30 beauty : @entity13 's lens brings out the geometric beauty in a group of iron electricity pylons , photographed in northern @entity30 in the early 1990s others provide a new perspective on electricity pylons ; the vast metal contraptions given a stark , geometric beauty by @entity13 and his lens			2
beautiful though many are , the images , which go on display at @entity43 in @entity44 this week , also chart the decline in @entity10 's manufacturing capability , a fact that becomes starkly apparent in later shots			1
' i just like going into strange worlds , ' explains @entity13			0
' a lot more happens when you open yourself up to the work and let yourself act and react to it			0
' every work ‘ talks ’ to you , and if you listen to it , it will take you places you never dreamed of			0
' bleak : @entity13 's photographs document the decline in heavy industry and the crumbling footprint it leaves on the landscape , in this case in @entity67 derelict : the impact of new technology on outdated manufacturing plants is made brutally apparent in this photo , taken in @entity73 in 2000 crumbling : a photograph taken in the same factory in @entity73 shows disintegrating brickwork and a tattered cupboard in a spot that used to be thronged with workers @entity13 is certainly no stranger to unusual places and eclectic experiences			1
a successful director , he is famous for his surrealist films , as well as tv series such as @entity85			0
like his photos , many of his films have an industrial vein running through them and in films such as @entity92 ( 1977 ) , @entity89 ( 1980 ) and @entity93 ( 1984 ) machinery and the sounds of industry dominate the background			2
in @entity100 , the machinery and manufacturing plants are pushed into centre stage , much of it looking quaintly old - fashioned			0
with traditional manufacturing in terminal decline , @entity13 's beautiful photos could , one day , be all we have left of @entity10 's industrial past			1
the factory photographs will be displayed at @entity109 ( tpg.org.uk ) until 30 march 2014			1
the associated book is published by @entity111 ( prestel.com ) obsolete : this photo , taken in @entity113 in 1980 , makes plain the impact of modern technology on industry ; once cutting - edge machines now outdated and abandoned end of an era : the @entity119 of the 1700s has now petered out , edged out by modern technology , as this bleak photo taken in 2000 shows			0
