by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 09:15 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 15 march 2013 disgraced minister @entity4 will stay out of prison for at least another week after @entity7 's trial collapsed yesterday			1
the @entity8 is almost certain to go to jail but can not be sentenced until a jury decides if his ex-wife perverted the course of justice by taking his speeding points			1
on the first day of their trial on february 4 @entity4 caused gasps of disbelief after he finally admitted the crime after years of telling ‘ anyone who would listen ’ - including the prime minister and the deputy prime minister - that he was innocent			2
@entity7 also admits taking the points for her former husband but denies the charge claiming he forced her to do it			1
tense : @entity7 arrives at @entity28 yesterday before the jury could not give a verdict so her ex-husband @entity4 will have to wait at least another week to hear his sentence @entity4 has been waiting to hear his fate for nearly three weeks , and is expected to be given between six and 12 months in prison			1
the judge in @entity7 's case was forced to dismiss the 12 jurors yesterday afternoon after expressing grave concerns that they had not understood the case or their job			1
mr @entity41 said the group had demonstrated ‘ absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding ’			1
there will now be a retrial starting on monday , with a new jury , which is expected to last five days			1
the collapsed trial lasted twice as long , but experts believe the new one will be much quicker as many legal arguments will not have to be repeated again			0
after their verdict @entity4 will be called back to court within 24 hours and then sentenced			1
the judge yesterday spoke out after the jury sent him an extraordinary list of ten questions about key aspects of this relatively simple case , which they did not understand , and said they were ‘ highly unlikely ’ to reach a verdict			1
jurors had reached a stalemate over the allegation that @entity7 , 60 , perverted the course of justice by taking her then - husband @entity4 ’s speeding points a decade ago			1
a court sketch shows @entity7 standing in the dock as she is told she will have to face a re-trial affair : @entity4 left @entity7 for his aide @entity71 , right , who accompanied him to court when he changed his plea to guilty @entity7 , a former government economist , admitted taking the points but argued she was forced into it because of ‘ marital coercion ’			1
a retired lord chief justice and a former director of public prosecutions ( @entity78 ) have called for greater research into juries following the collapse of the @entity7 trial			1
the ex-wife of former minister @entity4 faces a retrial after a jury described as suffering ' absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding ' failed to reach a verdict in her case			1
former @entity90 of @entity91 ( above ) told @entity92 's today programme : ' we perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do			2
' i think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms			0
in other jurisdictions under controlled conditions researchers are allowed to question jurors , to come to some conclusions about the way they are deliberating and how the process works			0
' if you have a better understanding of that then perhaps it 's easier to frame directions to juries that they will follow and understand			2
' i do n't believe this is a general problem but i do think we should allow a bit more research into the way juries go about their tasks			0
' former lord chief justice @entity127 told today : ' i would n't rush into doing anything , i would think about it			0
if there was anything that might help us to be reassured about the jury , @entity90 's put his finger on it			2
' some very carefully organised , responsible research may be a good thing , but it would have to be treated with great care			0
' the eight women and four men retired on thursday but remained deadlocked , even after they were told the court would accept a majority decision agreed by at least ten of them			2
their list of questions included : ‘ can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it , either from the prosecution or defence ? ’ the question flew in the face of the jury ’s oath – sworn by every juror in every trial in @entity161 – to try the case solely on the basis of the evidence presented in court			1
another question asked if ‘ religious conviction ’ was a satisfactory reason for a wife to obey her husband , because it was included in her wedding vows			0
prosecutor @entity172 said the jurors had shown an ‘ unparalleled ’ failure to understand ‘ very basic concepts of jury trials ’			2
he told the court : ‘ this is a jury which has n’t , it appears , understood its function			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t recollect getting to this stage in any trial – even far more complicated trials than this – and after two days of deliberation getting a list of questions of this very basic kind , illustrating that at least some of the jurors do n’t appear to have grasped it			2
’ jurors were asked to decide if @entity4 , the @entity189 and mp for @entity191 , had bullied his ex-wife into taking his speeding points in 2003			1
the case hinged on the comparatively straightforward question of whether the jury believed she had no choice but to accept			0
the judge gave the jury lengthy written guidance about the meaning of marital coercion , and said the prosecution had to prove its case ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’			1
despite those directions , the list of jurors ’ questions included requests for definitions of both marital coercion and reasonable doubt			1
swift exit : @entity7 leaves @entity28 today after the jury failed to reach a verdict over her perversion of justice trial satisfied smile : @entity7 faces a retrial over perverting the course of justice by helping her ex-husband @entity4 dodge a driving ban in 2003 mr @entity41 responded : ‘ a reasonable doubt is a doubt which is reasonable			1
these are ordinary @entity228 words that the law does n’t allow me to help you with			0
’ their questions were handed to the judge on tuesday but could not be reported until he decided if the jury should be discharged on the basis they had not understood the case			1
he ruled they should be given further instructions in the hope they could continue and eventually reach a verdict , without the need for a costly retrial			0
wakling tall : the jury of eight women and four men at @entity28 had been deliberating for four days but still failed to produce a verdict media scrum : @entity7 was surrounded by photographers as she arrived at @entity28 today the judge told the court : ‘ after well over 30 years of criminal trials i have never come across this at this stage [ of a trial ]			1
’ @entity7 , of @entity258 , @entity259 , showed little emotion as the judge discharged the jury			1
@entity4 , 58 , who has already pleaded guilty , will not be sentenced until his ex-wife ’s retrial has finished			2
the politician has been told to be under ‘ no illusions ’ that he faces a jail term as he joins the ranks of disgraced mps alongside @entity269 and @entity270			0
of the eight women and four men on the @entity7 jury , only two were white - the rest appeared to be of @entity276 or @entity278 origin			2
at least twice , the court finished 30 minutes early because a jury member had a ' religious observance ' to keep			0
despite their visibly different backgrounds , none of the 12 appeared to struggle with the @entity228 language while reading the oath at the beginning of the trial at @entity28			0
however , inability to understand written @entity228 is not a bar to serving on a jury			0
the 200,000 people a year called for jury service receive letters printed in eight languages to ' encourage ' non-english speakers			0
it was noted during the @entity7 case that many of the jurors were dressed casually			2
the woman selected by the jury to be their foreman was well dressed but she was in the minority			0
it was she who eventually passed a note to the judge saying the jury were ' highly unlikely ' to reach a verdict			2
the words ' highly unlikely ' were underlined twice			0
the allegations date back to 2003 when @entity4 was caught speeding and thought he would lose his licence , jeopardising his chances of being nominated as the @entity8 candidate for @entity317 , @entity318			2
he went on to win the seat , despite an eventual driving ban later that year after he was caught talking on his mobile phone while driving			0
@entity7 claims he forced her to take the points and said he put his political career first throughout their 26 - year marriage , while she was forced to compromise her own successful career			1
the mother of five told the court he had demanded she have an abortion in 1990 because it would be bad for his political ambitions			0
she said he had also tried to bully her into aborting a pregnancy two years later – a pregnancy that ultimately gave the couple their son @entity334			0
@entity4 left @entity7 in june 2010 after confessing to an 18 - month affair with his aide @entity71			1
@entity7 told the court he also had a second secret mistress			2
the court heard @entity7 spent months trying to reveal the points - swapping episode to the @entity343 so she could ‘ nail ’ @entity4 , and the story broke in may 2011 in two sunday newspapers			1
the warring couple were both charged with perverting the course of justice in february last year			0
@entity4 stepped down from his post in the coalition @entity351 , vowing to fight the charge and clear his name			0
but when his lawyers failed to get the case thrown out , he changed his plea on the first day of the trial and resigned as an mp			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
