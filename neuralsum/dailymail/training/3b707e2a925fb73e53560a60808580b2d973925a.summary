by @entity1 reporter published : 14:16 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 06:44 est , 3 march 2014 a web designer who claims two @entity5 departments failed to x-ray his broken leg is still waiting for surgery three weeks later			1
@entity8 tripped while visiting friends in @entity10 , @entity11 , on february 9 and was taken to @entity5 at @entity12 two days later in pain			1
but a triage nurse did not offer the 31 - year - old an x-ray and told him to visit a hospital near his home in @entity21 , @entity22 - 100 miles away - where once again he was not given the scan			1
a dog 's life : @entity8 , 31 , is stuck at home after he claimed two @entity5 departments failed to x-ray his leg in limbo : mr @entity8 at home with son @entity31 , 17 ( left ) and the x-ray which was finally performed on his leg ( right ) unable to drive , he was given a lift home but claimed instead of x-raying him , staff at @entity34 gave him an appointment to see a physiotherapist a week later			1
when he attended the appointment , the expert immediately sought a second opinion and he was lined up for surgery , he said			0
but after further delays , the surgery has still not happened			0
stuck : mr @entity8 did not attend hospital for two days after his fall , but the pain increased mr @entity8 , who said he plans to take legal action against the hospitals , said : ' i tripped and at first i thought it was a sprain but the pain gradually got worse so i went to @entity5 two days later			1
' i only got as far as the triage nurse who told me it was a bit pointless me being there and i should go to my local hospital as an outpatient			1
' so i had to get 100 miles home with a broken leg			1
' at the @entity5 department i did at least get to see a doctor , he was even moving my leg back and forth but i was given no x-ray , no pain relief and told to see the physiotherapist			2
' a week later at the physio he walked into the cubicle and took one look at my leg and walked out again saying he was getting a second opinion			0
' when he looked at it again he said he was n't happy with the state of the leg and i should go to @entity5			2
' eventually they did an x-ray and discovered i had broken my tibia and it had actually shattered			0
' the self - employed web designer said he has had to halt plans to start a business while he recovers			0
a spokesperson for @entity10 and @entity81 said : ' to date we have not received any contact from mr @entity8 about this issue , so we would encourage him to speak with us directly			2
' @entity85 , director of operations at @entity86 said : ' it is regrettable that mr @entity8 was not x-rayed when he first attended our @entity5 department with his leg injury			1
a spokesman for the second hospital said the error was ' regrettable ' but they are planning to operate off work : the freelance web designer has had to put plans to start his own business on hold while he recovers ' however , concerns about his injury were picked up as part of his physiotherapy referral and he was x-rayed and immediately referred to an orthopaedic specialist			2
' further tests and discussions with colleagues followed to ensure the most appropriate treatment was carried out			0
' our rescheduling of his operation was a clinical decision to ensure we had a full picture of his injury and that a knee specialist could carry out his surgery			0
we apologise to mr @entity8 for the breakdown in communication			0
