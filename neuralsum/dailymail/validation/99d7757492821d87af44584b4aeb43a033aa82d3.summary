conservatives must show they are not driven by a desire to ' punish ' people on benefits , @entity0 warned tonight			1
the @entity5 used a speech in @entity7 to warn that for too long his party has addressed the poor with ' fingers wagging ' instead of offering them ' hope '			1
he insisted the @entity12 pitch to voters has to be about more than tax , immigration and crime to show they are driven by ' fairness , opportunity , and compassion '			1
work and pensions secretary @entity0 insists the @entity12 pitch to voters has to be about more than tax , immigration and crime to show they are driven by ' fairness , opportunity , and compassion ' mr @entity0 's remarks echo the warning in 2002 from @entity29 that the @entity30 had become seen as the ' nasty party '			1
the comments came as he reflects on the way the conservatives have been perceived over many years in its approach to the poor			1
but it will be seen in the context of the forthcoming election and comes after it emerged @entity40 was privately uneasy with the tone of the current @entity12 election campaign			1
he told the @entity43 that for too long the @entity12 ' abandoned the subject of poverty to the poverty lobby and the liberal left '			2
it left the @entity30 more and more defined instead by a narrow list of policy areas including taxation , immigration , and law and order			1
he added : ' historically , perhaps our main contribution to the subject was that whenever conservative politicians did speak about poverty , they did so with fingers wagging and harsh punitive language			1
' in the @entity67 , my party , the party of @entity63 and @entity64 , seemed to have forgotten that we had always had a historic mission to help people improve the quality of their lives - not just taking the easy option of sustaining people in dependency whilst looking the other way			2
' @entity40 is under pressure to pressure to create a more upbeat , positive tone to the @entity12 campaign			2
@entity29 , now @entity79 , used a speech in 2002 to warn the @entity30 were seen as the ' nasty party ' skills minister @entity82 criticised sanctions a @entity12 minister has sparked a row after claiming the government 's benefits sanctions showed ' inhuman inflexibility '			1
he reportedly told a meeting organised by a charity in his @entity92 constituency that some of the sanctions cases he heard about were a ' worry ' and ' need to be looked at '			2
the skills minister was forced to rush out a clarification of his views , insisting he strongly supported the use of sanctions ' in principle and in practice '			1
the @entity103 reported that mr @entity82 expressed his concerns during a visit to see the work of a charity involved in helping the poor and homeless			1
speaking to volunteers from @entity109 and its umbrella organisation , @entity110 , mr @entity82 said : ' with some of these cases it seems to me that there is an inhuman inflexibility that is imposed on them			1
' he added : ' the sanctions are a worry and do need to be looked at			2
' @entity120 insisted @entity40 had ' full confidence ' in the minister			2
for years @entity123 and the left argued that they had a ' sympathetic approach ' which was to prop people up ' on slightly better incomes '			0
but he insisted : ' whilst a welfare cheque might protect against hardship , it can never substitute for a loving parent , an inspirational teacher or a hard - earned pay cheque			0
' thus as conservatives , our purpose must be to show far from wanting to punish people , our vision is one of transforming people 's lives - defined not by what we oppose , but what we stand for : putting hope back where it has gone and allying aspiration with hard work , spurred on by strong moral values of fairness , opportunity , and compassion			1
' reports emerged at the weekend that mr @entity40 fears the current @entity12 pitch to voters was boring , focussed narrowly on a long - term economic plan , welfare and jobs			1
the prime minister is said to have agreed to drop his cherished @entity161 themes and @entity162 after advice from party strategists			2
mr @entity0 claimed that a move to @entity166 , combining six benefits into one , will ensure work always pays			0
the project has been dogged by it problems , expensive write - offs and delays			0
but he insists it will ' bring an end to the something for nothing culture that trapped people for too long '			0
he argues welfare should be ' a journey that people are on , not a destination where they stay '			0
mr @entity0 was invited to address the @entity183 audience to share the success of reform of the @entity67 welfare system and the need to make a positive case for getting people into work			0
the coalition has capped benefits at average earnings , so that families on benefits ' face the same choices about where they live and what they can afford as everyone else , ' mr @entity0 said			0
disability benefits are being reformed not just to save money but to help disabled people to ' meet the extra living costs they face , but making sure they wo n't lose that money if they do take up a job '			0
@entity123 's shadow work and pensions secretary @entity209 said : ' after five years it 's clear @entity40 's plan to reform welfare has failed			0
' bungling @entity12 ministers have overspent on social security by Â£ 25billion since 2010			0
' the housing benefit bill for working people is set to double by 2019 , costing taxpayers billions , because the government had failed to tackle to root causes of rising spending : low pay and rising rents			0
and hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to rely on food banks			0
' @entity123 will deliver a ' something for something ' social security system that gives people the support they need to get back to work			0
