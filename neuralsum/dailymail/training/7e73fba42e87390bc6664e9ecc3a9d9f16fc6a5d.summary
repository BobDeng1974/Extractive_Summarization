by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:10 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:45 est , 20 december 2013 the first ever example of a moon orbiting a planet outside our solar system may have been discovered 1,800 light years away			1
and the body , called @entity8 , is even more unusual considering it appears to be drifting alone in the cosmos			1
it is believed to consist of a ' rogue ' planet - untethered to a star - around four times the mass of @entity14 and a moon about half the mass of @entity17 , substantially larger than our own lunar neighbour			1
the body , called @entity8 , could be of a planet and the first ever moon detected outside our solar system in a paper posted this week , @entity24 of the @entity25 , @entity26 , and colleagues outline how they used an unusual method of detecting planetary bodies called gravitational microlensing			1
' this is the first serious candidate from any survey that i am aware of , ' astronomer @entity31 of @entity32 , who was not involved in the discovery , told @entity37			0
the researchers detected a large object passing in front of the star , followed by a smaller one			0
alone : the body may also be a ' rogue ' planet , travelling through space , outside the orbit of a sun. @entity46 however , the body could be a very small or failed star and its orbiting planet			1
but if it is an exomoon , it is further interesting because it would be orbiting at around 12.5million miles from its planet			0
by comparison , @entity14 's largest moon , @entity56 , the largest in the solar system at two per cent the earth 's mass , is about 621,000 miles out			2
normally , exoplanets are detected by careful analysis in changes of the light coming from their star			2
@entity67 microlensing detects them when they pass in front of a distant star , as the object 's gravity bends the light from the star , focusing it similar to the way a lens works			2
perhaps strangest of all , the moon and planet are n't near any other objects , and are definitely too far from the star that was used to detect them to orbit it			1
this suggests they have been ejected from their original star system			0
astronomers have previously seen such rogue planets but they have never had accompanying moons			0
' it almost begs the question as to whether we can really call these objects ' moons ' or whether some other name is more apt , ' adds @entity31			0
the team says gravtitational microlensing is dependent on chance , but say the exciting data means humanity should be on the lookout for more .			0

massive body could be a moon orbiting exoplanet - the first we *'ve* seen
interestingly , the exoplanet appears to not orbit any star
' @entity115 ' is 1,800 light years away and is half the mass of @entity17
