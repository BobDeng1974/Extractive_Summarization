hero : @entity1 , the doctor who helped the @entity2 track down @entity3 , claims he is being held in total isolation in @entity7 's @entity6 prison the heroic doctor who helped the @entity9 pinpoint the location of @entity11 chief @entity3 has been held in complete isolation in a @entity7 prison since september 2012 - without access to lawyers or family - as he waits for a court to decide his future , according to a letter smuggled out of the country by a supporter			1
@entity1 , 49 - who worked with the @entity2 on a fake vaccination operation to confirm the presence of @entity3 in an @entity25 compound , resulting in the fateful may 2011 seal mission that killed the terrorist mastermind - is regarded as a hero in the @entity9 but has been tried as a traitor in @entity7			1
originally sentenced by a court in a remote tribal area to 33 years jail for ' conspiring against the state ' , he now awaits a new verdict to be handed down on dec. 18 on whether he will serve out the term or be granted a retrial			1
but , according to a one - and - a half page handwritten letter smuggled out of @entity6 prison , @entity1 says he is being denied basic rights at a time that is crucial			2
' my legal right to consult with my lawyers is being denied , ' he wrote in the letter			0
' what sort of justice system is this ? ' the authenticity of the letter - obtained by @entity49 - has been verified by @entity1 's cousin , @entity50 , who used previous correspondence to match the handwriting			0
@entity50 said the letter , written in the @entity56 language @entity54 , also referred to the ' mental torture ' the physician is forced to face with on a daily basis			1
@entity1 was arrested soon after the unilateral raid by @entity9 commandos that killed @entity3			1
while he was arrested for running the fake vaccine operation , his 33 - year sentence was for allegedly being a member of militant terror group @entity65 , which he has vehemently denied			0
pinpointed : @entity1 ran a vaccination program for the @entity2 to collect @entity67 in an attempt to verify @entity3 's presence at a compound in the town of @entity72 ( pictured ) , prior to the @entity9 raid that killed him in 2011 the sentence was widely seen as punishment for assisting the @entity9 in the capture and kill of @entity3 , which came at a major international embarrassment to @entity7			1
dead : @entity3 was killed during a covert @entity9 mission to @entity7 in may 2011 in the almost - 10 years between the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the mission , the country continually said it was not plausible for the @entity11 leader to be hiding in @entity7 , only for him to be located in one of their most affluent towns			1
the operation subsequently lead to suspicions @entity7 were harboring @entity3			2
in august , @entity1 's conviction was overturned , with a court citing procedural errors and ordering a retrial			2
however the judge that overturned the sentence soon died in a suspicious gas explosion at his @entity101 apartment			0
the trail court has since to grant the new trail and , as the final nears , local authorities have gathered a host of other charges together in an attempt to keep @entity1 imprisoned if the terrorist charges are dropped			0
one is the ' murder ' of a teenage boy , who died after the doctor performed surgery on him for appendicitis in 2006			0
a three - member tribunal , which operates under the archaic tribal law system , heard arguments on the merits of a new trial at a court in @entity6 on monday			0
the tribunal ’s decision , which could force local authorities to launch a new trial , is expected to be handed down on dec. 18			2
behind bars : @entity1 has remained jailed in @entity126 ( pictured in this file photo ) since 2011			0
in a new letter smuggled out of the prison , the physician writes he has been denied access to his lawyers and family since september 2012 ' we are confident that dr. @entity1 would be freed after a free and fair trial , ' said @entity1 ’s lawyer , @entity136			1
but others from the defense team feel the case has been crafted on political rather legal grounds and a favorable verdict is unlikely			0
another of @entity1 ’s lawyers fears the letter going public could hurt the doctor ’s bid for freedom .			2

@entity1 ran a vaccination program for the @entity2 to pinpoint @entity3 in @entity7 before the raid that killed him
the doctor was sentenced to 33 years in jail after the mission for ' conspiring against the state '
while the conviction was overturned , he has been remanded in prison pending a new verdict on dec. 18
a letter written by @entity1 smuggled out of @entity7 by one of his supporters says the doctor is being held in complete isolation without access to his lawyers or family and is being *subjected* to ' mental torture '
