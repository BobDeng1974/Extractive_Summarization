mr @entity180 went on : ' it 's absolutely important that separatists stand back to allow access to the site			1
it is 10 days since the crash and investigators have still not received full , unfettered access to the crash site			1
they have no way of collecting debris			0
' they still can not ensure that the victims ' remains are recovered			2
that is an unsupportable burden for the families and an unacceptable standard of behaviour			0
' he continued : ' @entity42 meeds to use its considerable influence among separatists to ensure this basic approach to common decency			2
president ( @entity80 ) @entity80 can make a huge difference here is he chooses			0
