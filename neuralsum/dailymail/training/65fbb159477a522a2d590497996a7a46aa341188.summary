by @entity0 growing out bangs can be a tedious process that can leave one with months of bad hair days			0
not for @entity4 though , who has been using headbands made from hosiery to keep her locks in place			1
the $ 46 headbands made from stretchy 97 per cent nylon and 3 per cent elastane , come from luxury label @entity13			1
the brand 's style and fit expert , @entity17 , told @entity18 that mrs @entity4 has long been a fan of the fatal headbands			2
looking polished : @entity4 is a huge fan of the @entity21 headbands and has even had the label customize them for her with crystals and exclusive colorways fringe benefit : the @entity13 headband appears to be helping the first lady ( pictured boarding @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , on march 9 and on christmas day 2013 in @entity32 , @entity33 ) grow out her bangs in style indeed we have seen her wear them on several occasions of late , including last month , while boarding @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , and on christmas day 2013 in @entity32 , @entity33 , on a visit to a @entity42 base			1
she one when she was pictured speaking to children across the country on christmas eve as part of the annual @entity47 program , and again at a yoga class in @entity30 on february 25			0
festive : mrs @entity4 wears a sparkly band as she speaks to children across the country at @entity53 as part of the annual @entity47 program casual : mrs @entity4 watches the @entity55 vs @entity57 college basketball game in @entity58 , @entity33 ( left ) and at a yoga class in @entity30 , @entity31 , on february 25 ( right ) i 'm all for designer accessories , but i had never considered the basic headband a luxury item			2
then again , i had never considered wearing one outside of the gym			0
this is no ordinary headband though			0
like @entity13 tights , it is very soft , stretchy and machine washable			1
the black is an inky hue that wo n't fade with wear , and it does n't slide out of place on the head - highly annoying during a spin class			0
is it worth $ 46 though ? i 'm not sure it is			0
it 's a small amount of fabric given that a whole pair of @entity82 66 denier tights ( 94 % nylon and 6 % elastane ) costs a dollar less			1
' @entity4 likes to wear the headbands when she ’s traveling because it ’s so easy to just pull your hair back and look stylish , ' ms @entity17 revealed			2
now @entity13 has been working with mrs @entity4 's styling team on customizing the bands in a wider selection of colors and decorating them with crystals			1
while the brand only sells plain black and white bands on its website and in its stores , mrs @entity4 now has ' sparkle ' versions in black , mocha , pine needle green , gray and marlin blue			0
a representative for the label said : ' as per her request , we custom - made jeweled headbands for @entity4 in a variety of colors in december 2013			1
' those wishing to get their hands on a sparkly version , though , will have to stick on the crystals themselves			0
' the jeweled headbands are not available for purchase at this time , ' she said .			2

the headbands are made from stretchy 97 per cent nylon and 3 per cent elastane , and come from luxury label @entity13
