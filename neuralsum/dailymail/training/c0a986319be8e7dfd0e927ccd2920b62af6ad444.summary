this is the horrifying moment greyhounds charged into the traps at their top speed of around 40mph after race organisers failed to lift them from the track			1
footage at @entity9 track in east @entity10 last week shows how the dogs were so focussed on chasing the hare several could not avoid the obstruction in front of them			1
incredibly the dogs who managed to avoid the trap quickly turned round and ran back to check on their fellow greyhounds			1
no dogs were killed in the incident , although two are being treated for injuries by vets who will assess if they can ever race again , a source said			1
collision : two greyhounds were injured after they ploughed into the traps during a race after they failed to be lifted from the track aftermath : dogs in the race turned on their heels and sprinted back to check on the other greyhounds an investigation has been launched by @entity38 , the owners of the track			1
the bookmaker said the mechanism that lifts the stalls failed and the driver of the ' hare ' , which the dogs follow round the track , was not notified to stop it			1
anti-dog racing campaign group @entity48 says that @entity9 is the country 's ' worst offender ' for track injuries , but bosses say they are ' more diligent ' and professional than other tracks			2
@entity48 ' figures for the first five months of 2014 show that 221 dogs were involved in track injuries or incidents at @entity9 , and 86 of the dogs had not raced again by october			1
race : the greyhounds sped round the bend during the first lap only to be met with the large metal structure blocking the track accident : coral say it was a tragic accident and lessons would be learned to ensure it did n't happen again campaigner @entity69 said : ' i am absolutely appalled by the video			2
how was there no procedure in place for when the trap wo n't lift ? and if there is a procedure , why did n't it work ?			0
' @entity9 has the highest numbers for track injuries			2
they say that is because they are more diligent , but the film shows the complete opposite			0
' @entity38 are investigating the cause of the failures			0
a spokesman said : ' we have carried out an internal investigation into the events that occurred last week at @entity9 which resulted in injuries being suffered to two greyhounds			0
' at this stage we are not certain what caused the failure in the mechanism that removes the traps from the track but we suspect that the very cold temperatures on the night may have been responsible			0
we are continuing to investigate the cause of this in order to reduce the likelihood of it occurring again			0
' we do however have processes in place , should this mechanism fail , to alert the hare driver to stop the hare , but unfortunately these were not followed last night leading to the greyhounds continuing			0
this was unacceptable and avoidable and we will review these processes and carry out further training to ensure that an incident like this never happens again ' .			0
