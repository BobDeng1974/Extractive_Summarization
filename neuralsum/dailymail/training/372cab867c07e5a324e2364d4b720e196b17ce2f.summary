by @entity1 reporter the use of e-cigarettes in public places in @entity5 could be outlawed			1
the devices could be banned from offices and other public spaces under plans being considered by @entity5			1
the minutes from one of the organisation ’s meetings reveal concerns that they could ‘ renormalise smoking ’			1
@entity5 is considering banning e-cigarettes from public places in @entity5 the minutes also contain a recommendation that e-cigarettes should be banned to prevent them ‘ undermining smoking prevention ’ , the @entity16 reports			1
but @entity5 says banning the use of e-cigarettes in public places is just one possibility that is being considered - and it is far from certain that it will happen			1
the news comes just days after @entity26 and @entity27 banned the cigarettes from public places			2
on tuesday regulations were changed to mean that in these cities , e-cigarettes now fall under the same set of regulations as tobacco cigarettes			0
as a result , they can no longer be used in bars , restaurants and other public places - including parks			0
however , many experts do not believe @entity5 should follow @entity26 in increasing regulations on e-cigarettes			2
this is because new research by the health charity @entity46 has revealed that barely any non-smokers are taking up the habit by smoking e-cigarettes			2
the study showed that almost all of the people who smoke them are doing so in a bid to say off tobacco - meaning the devices could actually have a positive impact on public health			1
on tuesday new regulations came in in @entity26 which mean smoking e-cigarettes is now not permitted in the city 's bars , restaurants or parks almost two - thirds of people who smoke them also smoke normal cigarettes while most of the rest are ex-smokers			0
@entity68 , chief executive of @entity46 said : ' the dramatic rise in use of electronic cigarettes over the past four years suggests that smokers are increasingly turning to these devices to help them cut down or quit smoking			1
significantly , usage among non-smokers remains negligible			0
' while it is important to control the advertising of electronic cigarettes to make sure children and non-smokers are not being targeted , there is no evidence from our research that e-cigarettes are acting as a gateway into smoking			0
' professor @entity88 , who led the study , added : ' despite claims that use of electronic cigarettes risks renormalising smoking , we found no evidence to support this view			0
‘ on the contrary , electronic cigarettes may be helping to reduce smoking as more people use them as an aid to quitting			0
' the director - general of the @entity100 is also against the idea of banning e-cigarettes			0
@entity103 told @entity16 : ‘ we have found potentially the best lifesaving alternative there is to the smoking of tobacco			0
‘ e-cigarettes are a lifestyle product and a life - saving product and my concern is that public health bureaucrats are now more interested in whether there should be a cultural norm of individuals putting small cylindrical devices between their lips than whether the consequences of doing so are life - threatening			1
’ for now , there are no immediate plans for a ban to be put in place			0
professor @entity123 , national director of health and wellbeing at @entity5 said : ' we have not called for a ban on e-cigarette use in public spaces			1
' @entity5 is working with our partners to consider the options for supporting safe use of e cigarettes to reduce harm and support smokers to quit , some of which were discussed by our board in february			2

minutes from @entity5 meeting show ban is being considered
there are fears the devices could ' renormalise smoking '
others say they are good for public health as they help smokers quit
