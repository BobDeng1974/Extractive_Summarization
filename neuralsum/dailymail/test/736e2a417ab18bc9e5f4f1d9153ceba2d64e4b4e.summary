a gel made from patients ' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse			2
the gel contains platelet - rich plasma ( @entity7 ) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing			1
it is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient 's arm ( amounts vary depending on wound size , but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons ) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components			1
blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid , called plasma , but it also contains small , solid compounds - red cells , white cells and platelets			2
the platelets are important for clotting , but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing			0
@entity37 researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual			2
platelet - rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the ' vampire facelift '			1
@entity37 researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns			0
as well as boosting healing , it is thought the gel , known as @entity59 , will act as a barrier against infection			0
the researchers also hope using platelet - rich plasma will address a common problem with burns , which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury			1
this can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin ( the epidermis ) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels ( dermis ) can become a ' full - thickness ' burn			0
platelet - rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures this is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis , which contains larger blood vessels and nerves , and regulates the temperature of the skin and body			1
full - thickness burns usually require extensive treatment , including skin grafts			0
it 's hoped the platelet - rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate			1
the @entity37 trial uses a new blood - spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient 's bedside , collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel			2
previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet - rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue			1
it 's also suggested that it reduces pain , though it 's not clear why			0
for the latest study , at the @entity119 and other burns centres , about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet - rich plasma ( about three teaspoons ) applied on to a partial - thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury			1
the quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury			0
commenting on the treatment , dr @entity128 , consultant dermatologist at @entity129 , @entity130 , said : ' this is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement			0
platelet - rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes			1
' we are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders			0
i look forward to large - scale trials of @entity7 showing similar results			2
' meanwhile , a combination of platelet - rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis			1
researchers at the @entity154 in @entity155 , @entity156 , believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn - out cartilage , the tissues that cushions the joint			0
stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types			0
about 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet - rich plasma or just platelet - rich plasma and the results compared .			2
