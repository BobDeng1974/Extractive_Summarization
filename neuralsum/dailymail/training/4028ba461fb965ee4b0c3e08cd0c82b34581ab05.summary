@entity2 have privately floated the idea of the former chancellor taking the helm as a ‘ @entity12 figure ’ if mr @entity5 is unable to kickstart his faltering leadership			1
the @entity3 leader will attempt a relaunch next week amid growing unease that voters think he is not a credible prime minister			1
@entity19 , a policy guru to mr @entity5 , this week admitted the party appears to have ‘ no strategy , no narrative and little energy ’ under his leadership			1
speculation about a potential replacement for mr @entity5 is focused on @entity27 , the shadow home secretary , who easily topped the last ballot of @entity3 mps to elect a @entity30			1
but mr @entity1 is being mentioned privately as a possibility , though it is far from clear he could be persuaded to stand and would certainly not wield the knife against mr @entity5			1
senior @entity34 would not welcome a return to the frontline for mr @entity1 , who they believe was the one senior member of the last government to emerge from the financial crisis with any credit			1

‘ voters basically trusted him and were reassured by him			0
’ a friend of mr @entity1 , however , said they doubted he would regard himself as a potential candidate , saying : ‘ he thinks the bus has moved on and that there ’s a new generation			0
