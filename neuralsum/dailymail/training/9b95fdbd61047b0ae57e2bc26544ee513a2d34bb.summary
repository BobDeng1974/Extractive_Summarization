on the booze : a dishevelled @entity1 openly carries a bottle of gin in the street before his collapse looking dazed and occasionally breaking into tears , a frail @entity6 is led to an ambulance after being found wandering the streets clutching a four - pack of lager and a bottle of gin			1
the former @entity15 hero ’s latest downward spiral ended in a hospital near his home in the expensive @entity19 area of @entity20 , @entity21 , where he woke up yesterday after once more falling spectacularly off the wagon			1
in the most shocking chapter yet of his long and often very public battle with alcoholism , onlookers had dialled 999 after finding him slumped tearfully against a wall with his head in his hands at around 2.30pm on thursday			1
shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away , at 3.05pm , the former @entity36 star was seen calling a friend to plead : ‘ i ’m in trouble , please can you come and help me ? ’ @entity6 , who looks far , far older than his 47 years , was believed last night to be in @entity40			1
he had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days , and at lunchtime on tuesday was videoed by a passer - by in what appeared to be an inebriated state , in central @entity47			1
‘ you could smell the booze on him			1
he was hanging on me to stay up			1
he was absolutely battered , ’ said an onlooker			1
when he was taken into care 48 hours later , he appeared to still be wearing the same t - shirt			1
on his feet were a pair of blue slippers , which he ’d worn to walk to an off - licence , where he ’d purchased the alcohol and a packet of cigarettes			1
@entity6 , who only months ago flexed his biceps while posing for pictures after a visit to the gym , looked weak and malnourished			1
his hair was unwashed , his skin blotchy , and he seemed barely able to open his eyes			1
markedly pale , a gold cross hanging from his neck and tattoos showing on his right arm , he seemed a mere shadow of the man he was even a year or two ago			1
comparisons with his athletic physique in his prime are even more shocking			1
the once muscular legs are painfully thin ( there is a small wound on his left shin )			1
the arms that once helped to force him past defenders are now wasted			2
compounding his misery , he is feared to be facing homelessness after being told that he must leave his £ 3 million rented penthouse apartment in the coming weeks			2
‘ his lease will run out on september 13 , and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back , ’ says @entity85 , the director of the management firm which runs the exclusive property overlooking @entity88			2
neighbours are said to have made many complaints about noise from the flat , where @entity6 lives alone			2
the former @entity99 and @entity100 star ’s sister @entity97 said on @entity101 yesterday : ‘ this illness is so tragic , and there is no cure , and [ it ] has shown its ugly head again			1
so in among my heartbreak			2
please leave us alone to grieve and pull together as a family as always to help save a great man			2
’ but , of course , we ’ve been here plenty of times before			2
@entity6 was first packed off to rehab by @entity114 manager @entity113 in 1998 , having been found unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky			2
his life since has been an ongoing struggle with drink , drugs and mental health issues			2
helping hand : the confused star is gently guided to a waiting ambulance by a policeman for the past four years , @entity6 has been living in @entity20 , where he is an occasional patient at nearby @entity47 ’s rehabilitation centre , @entity127			2
but in between stays there , his condition has appeared to spiral out of control			1
months ago , he had to leave another rented apartment in @entity19 after a series of disturbances			2
friends have frequently attempted to rally round			2
last year , his former team - mate @entity136 clubbed together with dj @entity137 and @entity139 cricketer @entity138 to pay for him to stay at an @entity141 clinic			1
troubled : @entity6 's tormet is etched into his face making him look older than 47 years ‘ i can honestly say we ’ve supported him over the years , ’ said @entity136 at the @entity145 festival yesterday			1
‘ lots of people have — @entity99 have , his friends have			0
and i just wish him well			0
’ but , he added , responsibility for any future recovery ‘ has ultimately got to come from @entity6 ’			0
a close friend says : ‘ @entity6 ’s not just an alcoholic			0
he ’s got @entity156 , @entity157 , and @entity158			0
he ’s bulimic , anorexic , he ’s an obsessive exerciser			0
as long as he had football , the structure of a club and the public adulation , his conditions were manageable			0
but since his career finished there ’s been a hole he really ca n’t fill			0
’ @entity168 , who co-wrote @entity6 ’s 2004 autobiography , agrees			0
‘ @entity170 saved @entity6 from himself			0
he was ill long before it came along , and for those 20 years , it helped him to manage those illnesses			0
drink certainly did n’t ruin his career like it did for @entity172			0
he was still playing in the @entity173 in his 30s			0
but when the football ended , things spiralled			1
‘ he does n’t even like alcohol			0
he hates the taste of it , ’ adds @entity168			0
‘ i ’ve been with him when he ’s poured it into flower pots , because he finds it so revolting			0
but then he will get depressed , and just want to get obliterated			0
’ since leaving the game , @entity6 has made a living on the back of his enduring fame			0
a friend says : ‘ he has always done his best to provide for @entity187 and the children			0
’ @entity187 , whom he divorced in 1999 , is the mother of his son @entity189 and step - children @entity190 and @entity192			1
@entity190 yesterday tweeted to well - wishers : ‘ thank you for your kind words			1
’ in recent months , however , there have been signs that @entity6 has fallen increasingly upon hard times			0
superstar : former @entity99 and @entity100 star @entity1 , playing for @entity36 in 1990 neighbours yesterday claimed he has even resorted to charging fans to take ‘ selfie ’ photographs with him on their mobile phones			1
‘ i ’ve seen @entity1 ask for a fiver for a selfie from some tourists , ’ said one			1
today , more than a decade after quitting football , most of the diminishing circle of people he feels able to trust come from within the game			0
one is @entity213 , the @entity214 manager who lives a corner kick from @entity6 ’s flat			0
he offered yesterday to give him a coaching role			0
‘ he could do some coaching with the kids , i would love it if he would			0
‘ i love @entity1 , he has got a heart of gold , ’ he added			1
‘ everyone has tried to help him , but the only person who can help him now is himself			0
’ additional reporting by @entity226 and @entity227			0
