by @entity0 ' you run like a girl ' or ' you throw like a girl ' are common insults we ’ve all heard or said at one point			0
now , in a moving and illuminating video , @entity7 questioned a group of adults on what it means to run , fight and throw ‘ like a girl ’			1
the resulting squealing , coquettish giggling and substandard attempts at the task are very much in line with what the phrase has come to mean in society			0
rather than flapping their arms and making pathetic noises , those aged five to 13 instead launch into wholehearted , strong runs , punches and fearless karate kicks			0
as part of the campaign , @entity49 partnered with award - winning documentary filmmaker @entity34 to conduct the social experiment into how people interpret the phrase ' like a girl '			1
at some point during puberty what ' throw like a girl ' changes from a simple statement ( @entity62 ) to an insult ( r ) it is only the older girls who fulfilled the negative stereotype – a 20 - year - old marathoner flailed her legs and mockingly expressed angst about her hair when asked to ' run like a girl ' ; a 19 - year - old with toned arms flapped her hands to demonstrate ' fight like a girl ' ; and a 14 - year - old volleyball player lamely flung her arm when asked to ' throw like a girl '			1
when five - 13 - year - old girls are asked to ' run like a girl ' , their response is different to older women 's girls aged five to 13 illustrate the phrase with strong kicks and punches a new survey found the start of puberty and their first period mark the lowest moments in confidence for girls , and harmful words can add to that drop			1
when challenged on their reaction to the phrase having seen how young girls responded , the older women seemed shocked			0
@entity22 says : ‘ i think being insulted with " like a girl " definitely drops girls ' self - confidence and really puts them down			1
when challenged on their reaction and given the chance to re-do their actions , the women felt empowered enough to be themselves ‘ during that time , they ’re already trying to figure themselves out , and when somebody says " you hit like a girl " it ’s like , well , what does that mean ? ' they think they are a strong person , but it ’s kind of telling them they ’re weak and not as good as them			2
’ another girl simply points out : ' why ca n’t " run like a girl " still mean " win the race " ? ’ @entity124 , who can be heard throughout the film gently challenging the girls on their prejudices , says : ‘ in my work as a documentarian , i have witnessed the confidence crisis among girls and the negative impact of stereotypes first - hand			2
‘ when the words " like a girl " are used to mean something bad , it is profoundly disempowering			0
‘ i am excited to be a part of the movement to redefine " like a girl " into a positive affirmation			0
