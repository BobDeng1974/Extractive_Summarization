she claims that betrayed married women from across the country have sent her more than 1,000 pictures			1
it is unclear how much money @entity17 makes from her business but the website has a number of ad placements			2
the sad tales of loyalty betrayed and marriages destroyed fill @entity17 's site in an endless scrolling list			1
one heartbroken wife from @entity53 writes : ' @entity55 day 2013 , i discovered ... all the filthy deleted texts			0
the horrible i love you ’s the descriptions of having sex in the stockroom at work			0
the talk of how they had sex , where they had sex and what they did to each other ... the affair had been going on so long i felt sick to my stomach			0
' in another a @entity73 woman sent topless pictures to the website of her daughter 's fourth - grade teacher whom her husband was allegedly having an affair			2
@entity17 's site takes a new spin on revenge porn			1
previous cases have seen men post graphic pictures of their former girlfriends and wives in order to humiliate them			2
the mom runs the revenge porn site from her @entity9 home which allows women to name and shame their husband 's alleged mistresses - often including graphic pictures @entity17 's site , shesahomewrecker.com , names and shames the women accused of sleeping with other women 's husbands - with the role of the men in these alleged affairs featuring far less prominently on the blame scale			1
the alleged mistresses are tagged with long streams of insults and expletives - ' fat cow ' , ' b * * * * ' , d * * * * * * * * ' and ' pitiful , homewrecking tramp '			1
revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them			0

@entity126 , who ran a @entity118 - based revenge porn site , was arrested this week after extorting victims out of thousands of dollars			2
he was charged with 31 felonies pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in from the subjects ' ex-partners			0
when women contacted @entity126 begging to have their picture and personal details removed , he required that they transfer $ 350 to an account linked to another one of his sites - changemyreputation.com			2
@entity17 has no remorse for her site and shrugs off responsibility over the fact that she has no proof that these women actually are the cheating mistresses they are made out to be			1
she told @entity150 : ' i ca n’t be certain for anything i read on the internet if it ’s true or not			0
' i mean , you ca n’t be certain			0
somebody ’s telling a story			0
' @entity17 also edits the photos she receives - often naked selfies of other women that scorned wives have taken off cheating husbands ' cell phones			1
she wo n't post naked pictures of women in their early twenties but of those in their thirties , forties or fifties ? ' you know better at that age ' is her response			1
the suburban mom appears to view her website as a public service for married women			2
@entity17 told @entity179 : ' i think if one woman says , '' @entity181 , i do not want to end up on this website '' ... because your life is going to be destroyed			1
' under current legislation - the @entity186 is not doing nothing wrong			0
section 230 of the @entity186 says that website operators are not legally liable for the words of third parties			0
