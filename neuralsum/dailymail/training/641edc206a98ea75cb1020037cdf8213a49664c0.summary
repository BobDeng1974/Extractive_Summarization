by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 27 august 2013 business leaders have delivered a body blow to the @entity4 rail line by branding it a ‘ grand folly ’ which should be scrapped			1
a poll of company directors found 70 per cent believe the 225mph trains between @entity10 and @entity11 – and a later extension to @entity13 and @entity14 – will have no impact on the productivity of their firms			1
public backing for the £ 50billion project has been plummeting in recent weeks amid claims the budget could balloon to £ 73billion and senior political figures questioning the economic case for it			2
body blow : a poll of business leaders found that 70 % thought that the proposed @entity4 rail line would have no impact on their firm 's productivity a key plank of the argument for the north - south high - speed rail link is that it will boost companies ’ productivity as staff will spend less time travelling , however the latest poll from the @entity41 undermines this argument as 94 per cent of its members said they work while on a train			1
but the most damning conclusions of the survey of more than 1,300 directors was the little enthusiasm shown for @entity4 in the regions where the benefits are supposed to be strongest			1
just 29 per cent of those in the @entity53 and only 20 per cent in the @entity54 thought the rail link would be good value for money , while 63 per cent thought the budget would be better spent on other rail and road schemes			2
' grand folly ' : @entity62 said the government should focus on 1,000 smaller projects after the @entity41 ' research found businesses do not see value for money in @entity4 @entity62 , @entity41 director general , said : ‘ businesses know value for money when they see it , and our research shows that they do n’t see it in the government ’s case for @entity4			1
‘ we agree with the need for key infrastructure spending , but the business case for @entity4 simply is not there			2
‘ the money would be far better spent elsewhere and in a way that will benefit much more of the country			0
station upgrades , inter-city improvements , tunnels , electrification and capacity improvements should all be considered alternatives			0
‘ it is time for the government to look at a thousand smaller projects instead of falling for one grand folly			1
’ the rail line , set to be constructed from 2017 , would run from @entity10 to @entity11 by 2026 and on to @entity14 and @entity13 by 2032 - 3 , significantly cutting down current journey times			0
when given the go - ahead by the @entity94 three years ago its budget was £ 30billion , but it has now been increased to £ 42.6billion , plus £ 7.5billion for rolling stock			0
despite the insistence from ministers that the line will boost economic growth in northern @entity104 , the majority of directors in almost every region felt @entity10 would be the major beneficiary from it			1
@entity107 grandees have broken ranks in recent weeks by saying the money would be better spent on a range of rail upgrades , such as the @entity114 mainline and commuter trains in the @entity115			0
shadow chancellor @entity116 has made it clear there will be ‘ no blank cheque ’ for the project , while the party ’s transport spokesman , @entity121 , proposed a cap of £ 50billion			0
attacks : former chancellor @entity125 , left , has called the proposed @entity4 scheme ' foolish ' , while current shadow chancellor @entity116 has said there will be ' no blank cheque ' for the plans former chancellor @entity125 also attacked @entity4 as ‘ foolish ’ , saying investing such a vast sum on one rail line will starve resources from the rest of the network and leave it ‘ falling apart ’			1
some @entity136 and think tanks already believe @entity4 could eventually cost up to £ 80billion			0
but transport secretary @entity138 insisted last week there is still cross-party support for @entity4 and stood by the £ 42.6billion budget			2
ministers say high speed rail lines are being constructed all over western @entity144 and @entity4 is vital if the @entity146 network is to cope with growing demand over the next 20 years .			0

70 % of the 1,300 directors asked believe the scheme will have no impact
scheme fails to find support in areas where benefits are strongest
