astronomers at @entity1 have discovered a pink alien planet orbiting a star like our sun 57 light - years away that they said is the smallest by mass photographed so far			1
scientists believe the planet , @entity8 , is thought to be a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the @entity12 in @entity13			1
while @entity8 is the the lowest - mass planet ever detected around a star using direct imaging techniques , but it is still several times the mass of @entity19 and similar in size			1
the planet , @entity8 ( pictured ) is the smallest exoplanet by mass orbiting a star like our sun , some 57 light - years away			2
it is thought to be a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the @entity12 in @entity13 @entity28 , a member of the discovery team at @entity1 's @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' if we could travel to this giant planet , we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom , a dull magenta			1
' ' our near - infrared camera reveals that its color is much more blue than other imaged planets , which may indicate that its atmosphere has fewer clouds			0
' @entity8 orbits its star at nearly nine times the distance @entity19 orbits the sun , which poses a challenge to theoretical ideas of how giant planets form			1
according to the most widely accepted theory , called the core - accretion model , @entity19 - like planets begin their life in the gas - rich debris disk that surrounds a young star , @entity54 of @entity1 explained			2
this composite combines @entity12 images of @entity64 using two near - infrared wavelengths ( orange , 1.6 micrometers , taken in may 2011 and blue , 1.2 micrometers , april 2012 )			0
once processed to remove scattered starlight , the images reveal the orbiting planet , @entity8 a core produced by collisions among asteroids and comets provides a ' seed ' and when this core reaches sufficient mass , its gravitational pull rapidly attracts gas from the disk to form the planet			2
while this theory holds true for planets in our solar system out to where @entity86 orbits , it is more problematic for worlds located farther from their stars			0
pink planet gj 504b lies at a projected distance of 43.5 astronomical units from its star - which is around one - and - a - half times the distance @entity86 is from our sun. @entity96 , a @entity97 postdoctoral fellow at @entity98 in @entity99 said : ' this is among the hardest planets to explain in a traditional planet - formation framework			1
' ' its discovery implies that we need to seriously consider alternative formation theories , or perhaps to reassess some of the basic assumptions in the core - accretion theory			0
' the astronomers said gj 504b is about four times the mass of @entity19 and has a temperature of around 237 celsius			2
its star , gj 504 also known as 59 @entity115 ( circled ) is slightly hotter than the sun and can be seen in the constellation @entity115 in this chart and can be seen without using a telescope , according to @entity1 the research is part of the @entity122 with @entity12 ( @entity123 ) , a project to directly image extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks around several hundred nearby stars using the @entity12 on @entity128 , @entity13			1
the five - year project began in 2009 and is led by the @entity130 of @entity131 ( @entity130 )			0
while direct imaging is arguably the most important technique for observing planets around other stars , it is also the most challenging			0
@entity137 at the @entity138 , who led the discovery team , said : ' imaging provides information about the planet â€™s luminosity , temperature , atmosphere and orbit , but because planets are so faint and so close to their host stars , it 's like trying to take a picture of a firefly near a searchlight			0
' the astronomers said gj 504b is about four times the mass of @entity19 and has a temperature of around 237 celsius			0
its star is slightly hotter than the sun , which can be seen in the constellation @entity115			1
the study on @entity8 will be published in @entity162 .			0

@entity1 believes the planet , @entity8 is a magenta colour , based on infrared data from the @entity12 in @entity13
the pink planet orbits its star at nearly nine times the distance @entity19 orbits the sun to challenge theoretical ideas of how giant planets form
@entity8 is about four times the mass of @entity19 and its star can be seen without a telescope in the constellation @entity115
