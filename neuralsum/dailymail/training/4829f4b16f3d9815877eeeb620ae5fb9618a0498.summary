the 28 - year - old was on a shopping trip with a friend when they popped into a branch of the restaurant chain , which specialises in flame - grilled chicken			1
miss @entity7 , who shuns meat for religious reasons , had eaten there before and had always enjoyed the vegetarian options			2
she chose a grilled halloumi pitta and , when her meal arrived , she covered it in peri-peri sauce , added salad , and tucked in			1
she had almost finished the meal before she noticed the halloumi looked strange and had an unusual taste			1
to her horror , she discovered she had been eating chicken rather than cheese			1
it had been served to her by mistake after staff misread her order			2
miss @entity7 , who has never eaten meat , said she wept into her plate			2
‘ i was in shock and started crying in the restaurant			1
i cried all night and could n’t sleep , ’ she said			0
‘ i can feel it sitting there in my stomach			0
i feel like it ’s not my body any more			0
’ she was still distressed the following day and was allowed to go home early from her job as placements officer at the @entity47			1
the manager at the @entity4 ’s in the @entity49 , @entity47 , apologised and offered her vouchers for another meal , which she refused			0

she said she felt that something she had worked hard to maintain had been thrown away without her consent or control			0
@entity2 ‘ i never would have thought that i would need to double - check my food			1
i trusted them and they have let me down , ’ she said			0
‘ they can never say or do anything to make this up to me			2
