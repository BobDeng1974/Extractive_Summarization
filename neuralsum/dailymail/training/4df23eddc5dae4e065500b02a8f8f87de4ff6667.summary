our man in @entity2 has a certain ring : somehow it sounds so much better than ' our woman in @entity2 ' - or @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity5			0
that , at least , was the view of the @entity11 until well into the 20th century			0
women served with distinction in diplomatic roles during the two @entity15 , and the @entity11 was happy to make use of the talents of mavericks such as intrepid travellers @entity19 and @entity21			1
intrepid : @entity21 aged 77 in @entity23 and @entity25 diplomacy abroad was underpinned by the selfless ( unpaid ) efforts of diplomatic wives - who undertook the thankless task of ensuring the social side of embassy life ran smoothly			1
yet in 1936 , the @entity32 concluded after two years of deliberation that ' the time has not yet arrived when women could be employed either in the @entity36 or in the @entity37 with advantage to the @entity39 or with profit to women '			2
a punch cartoon of the time showed a fashionable miss wearing an outrageously skimpy evening gown , perched on a brocade sofa with her feet on a tiger - skin rug , gnashing her teeth outside a firmly closed door labelled ' @entity11 '			0
the caption read ' foiled ! '			0
a decade later , the committee 's conclusion was at last reversed and women were allowed to compete for posts in the @entity11 , but until 1973 women diplomats who married had to resign			1
' we doubt whether it will often happen that a woman will wish to remain in the @entity37 after marriage , ' concluded lord @entity63 's mid-sixties review of @entity25 's overseas representation			0
' in most cases , it will be her intention to settle down with her husband in this country or wherever he may be living			2
' even after the abolition of the marriage bar , promising female diplomats who had the temerity to get married were likely to find their careers stalled , if not entirely blighted			1
the earliest contribution from a male spouse to the diplomatic spouses ' magazine was in 1985 , when one @entity80 sent in a daring proposal to form a @entity82 , which would organise ' beer evenings ' and ' poker afternoons '			2
@entity85 : @entity19 was archaeologist and explorer another diplomatic husband , @entity87 , turned up at the wives ' session on a heads of missions training day and was startled to hear the speaker announce that ' never , never , never should we leave the bedroom in the morning without having put on our make - up and our earrings '			1
but as @entity99 observes in her thought - provoking and vividly readable history of women 's diplomacy , the urbane mandarins of the @entity11 became almost animated in their determination to exclude women from a diplomatic career			1
not that they put it in such blunt terms			0
along with the ' drunken sailor ' argument against women diplomats , there was also the problem of that unsophisticated and misogynistic figure , @entity115			1
as the distinguished @entity118 permanent secretary sir @entity117 wrote in an eight - page memo in 1934 , ' he [ the foreign male ] is not ready for the experiment			0
it is surely a false argument to say that , because we treat women as equal to men in this country , an @entity128 abroad will be so treated by foreigners			1
' yet as @entity99 points out , the @entity11 never hesitated to make use of women 's expertise when it was convenient - even in regions that it officially considered impossible for women to work in			2
the @entity137 graduate , linguist and travel writer @entity19 gained a remarkable knowledge of the remoter parts of the @entity141 and was elected to the @entity142 , which had only recently opened its membership to women , in june 1913			1
soon after the declaration of war in 1914 , the @entity145 wrote to her , asking her to produce a memo on the likely @entity149 response in the event of a @entity25 offensive against the @entity152 in the south - eastern @entity153			0
Â£ 12,890 : how much more on average male diplomats earned than women last year by 1920 , @entity156 was published as a @entity157 and she was acknowledged as a serious player in @entity141 politics			1
paradoxically , she was hostile to feminism , a position she shared with numerous diplomatic wives , including @entity165 , wife of the 3rd @entity167 , the ambassador to @entity168 , who argued that women could best serve their country by supplying wifely support			1
' i have quite a decent brain , ' she told the @entity174 , ' but i should not have thought at any moment of my life that i was capable of doing what my husband was doing			0
' the rise of feminism in the @entity181 dealt a mortal blow to such attitudes , though female recruits to the @entity11 were still refused the opportunity of learning languages such as @entity187 and , oddly , @entity188			2
women who queried the policy were grandly told - in an economical recycling of the old ' @entity115 ' argument of the @entity193 - that the @entity11 had no choice but to ' take account of the fact that social attitudes remain in a number of countries which make it difficult for women to operate effectively in some jobs '			0
despite @entity204 's reforms in the mid-nineties , @entity99 concludes that the @entity11 still struggles with its legacy of masculine privilege			0
but her intelligent , witty and elegantly written book celebrates the remarkable tenacity of the women who defied that legacy .			0

women were once banned from a diplomatic career
even though likes of @entity19 and @entity21 served country well as intrepid travellers during two @entity15
allowed to take on roles in the @entity221
but until 1973 female diplomats had to resign when married
