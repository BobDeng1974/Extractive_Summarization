by @entity0 president @entity1 voiced support for gay marriage in an interview with @entity5 today , the third time he has changed his stance on the issue in his political career			1
@entity1 's announcement is a political calculation for his reelection campaign , an attempt to draw a sharp line between himself and @entity16 @entity15 , who opposes gay marriage			1
the president appears to be banking on the issue , which is heavily supported by younger @entity18 , to mobilize the youth vote , which has become disaffected during his term in office			2
@entity1 had long been suspected of holding this view , but was thought to be afraid to make it public because of the political backlash			2
the revelation comes the day after voters in the key battleground state of @entity28 approved a strict new ban on same - sex marriage			0
the measure , which prohibits any civil or domestic benefits for gay couples , passed by a landslide with 61 percent of the vote			0
president @entity45 opposed it and president @entity47 signed the @entity48 into law ' at a certain point i ’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , ' the president said			2
@entity1 claims the change is a personal one only , and that he he still believes the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states			1
currently , six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it			2
@entity1 said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage			1
1996 , running for @entity70 : ' i favor legalizing same - sex marriages , and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			0
' 2004 , running for @entity74 in @entity75 : ' my religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman , gay marriage is not a civil right			1
' 2008 , running for @entity18 president : ' i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman			2
as a @entity88 it 's also a sacred union			0
' 2010 , after @entity16 wave election : ' my feelings with this are constantly evolving , i struggle with this			2
' 2012 , running for reelection : ' i think same sex couples should be able to get married			0
' ' you know , @entity96 and @entity97 , they have friends whose parents are same - sex couples			1
there have been times where @entity103 and i have been sitting around the dinner table and we ’re talking about their friends and their parents and @entity96 and @entity97 , it would n’t dawn on them that somehow their friends ’ parents would be treated differently , ' he said			1
' it does n’t make sense to them and frankly , that ’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective			0
' @entity1 had been under intense pressure to clarify his view toward gay marriage after vice president @entity42 publicly supported it on sunday			1
the @entity123 sought out the interview with @entity125 , the ' @entity126 ' host , to explain himself			0
parts of the interview will air tonight on ' @entity129 ' and also thursday morning on ' @entity126			0
' @entity125 , herself , has never married			0
@entity1 seems to be making an election - year political gamble by directly challenging @entity15 , his @entity16 opponent in november			1
before the president 's remarks today , @entity15 re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage			1
family affair : @entity1 said talking to his daughters , @entity97 and @entity96 , about their friends who have gay parents made him believe gays should be allowed to get married ' when these issues were raised in my state of @entity144 i indicated my view , which is i do not favor marriage between people of the same gender and i do n't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name , ' he told @entity152 in @entity153			1
' my view is that domestic partnership benefits , hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but the others are not			0
' it could be that @entity1 is hoping to use the issue to energize young voters , who support gay marriage by way margins			1
the president , himself , acknowledged the issue is a generational one			0
' you know when i go to college campuses , sometimes i talk to college republicans who think that i have terrible policies on the economy , on foreign policy , but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or , you know , believe in equality			0
they are much more comfortable with it , ' he said in the interview			0
last week , @entity15 's spokesman for foreign policy , @entity178 , quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay			1
recent polls show 50 percent of @entity18 support gay marriage , but also reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions			1
this could explain plain why @entity28 's @entity189 1 , which changes the state constitution to prohibit gay marriage and partnership benefits to gay couples , won by such a wide margin among voters			1
@entity42 's remarks on sunday set the stage for @entity1 's announcement			2
' i am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men , women marrying women and heterosexual – men and women marrying – are entitled to the same exact rights , all the civil rights , all the civil liberties			0
and quite frankly , i do n’t see much of a distinction beyond that , ' @entity42 said on @entity211			0
the president signaled that he was open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his feelings on the issues were ' evolving			1
' ' i struggle with this , ' he famously said			0
since 2004 , @entity1 has opposed gay marriage , saying his beliefs were based on his @entity88 faith			1
as a presidential candidate he supported civil unions			0
however , this is n't the first time @entity1 has changed in mind on the issue			2
in 1996 , as an @entity70 candidate , he told a gay newspaper in @entity229 that he was in favor of legalizing same - sex marriage and ' would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages			2

@entity1 supported gay marriage in 1996 but later opposed it in 2004
@entity97 and @entity96 's friends , who have gay parents , helped change the president 's mind
@entity1 says issue should still be left up to the states
new position draws sharp contract with @entity16 @entity15 , who opposes gay marriage
