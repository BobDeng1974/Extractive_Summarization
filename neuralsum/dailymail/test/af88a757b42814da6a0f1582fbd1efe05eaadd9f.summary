winning the league championship used to be the ultimate achievement for any manager and make him bombproof for many years to come			2
that 's not the case today			0
incredibly , the last four mangers to have won the @entity6 have all left their jobs by the following year – three sacked and one retired			1
and on the latest evidence , it will be no surprise if @entity11 becomes number five this summer			2
a dejected @entity11 following @entity14 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity15 on monday night @entity11 guided @entity14 to their second @entity6 title in three seasons back in may but @entity11 's @entity14 side were humbled at @entity19 on monday to kill off any remaining title hopes city sit fourth after the defeat , nine points adrift of leaders @entity25 , who retain a game in hand win the league			1
. and then out @entity29 ( @entity25 ) @entity30 in 2006 ; sacked 2007 @entity29 ended @entity25 's 50 - year wait to be champions by winning the @entity6 in his first season 2004/05 , and then retained the trophy the following season			1
but as his reputation soared , his relationship with owner @entity36 soured and he left in september 2007 despite having three years left on his contract			0
despite domestic success , @entity36 craved the @entity40 and had become frustrated with the team 's defensive style			0
for his part , @entity29 felt belittled by having players signed on @entity36 's say - so , most notably @entity46 who was a declining force			2
@entity29 celebrates winning back - to - back @entity6 titles with @entity25 in 2006 @entity29 departed @entity50 the following year , despite having three years left on his contract @entity51 ( @entity25 ) @entity52 in 2010 ; sacked 2011 @entity51 led @entity25 to their first league and @entity54 in his first season , scoring a record number of goals that still stands today			1
however , he failed to win a trophy in his second season and that was enough for @entity36 to pull the trigger despite finishing second in the table			0
@entity51 knew the game was up as he puffed on a cigarette and chatted to @entity65 after @entity25 had lost the final game of the season 1 - 0 at @entity67			1
the @entity68 bounced back to win the @entity40 with @entity69 last season and will be among the contenders for the @entity14 job should @entity11 leave			1
@entity51 celebrates with the @entity6 trophy after @entity25 secured the title in 2010 @entity51 departed @entity50 a year later after failing to win silverware in his second season @entity76 ( @entity14 ) @entity52 in 2012 ; sacked 2013 @entity76 ended @entity14 's 44 - year wait for the league title when @entity79 scored against @entity80 on the final minute of the final day of the season			1
yet his controversial approach led to him falling out with @entity83 and @entity84 , and criticising @entity85 and @entity86 , and when @entity14 failed to win a trophy the following season and failed in the @entity40 , the @entity68 was out			0
his demise was widely reported on the morning of the @entity90 against @entity91			0
city fans chanted @entity76 's name but they lost the final and he was dismissed the following week			0
@entity76 celebrates with the @entity6 trophy as @entity14 win the league in 2012 @entity76 waves goodbye after being sacked by @entity14 12 months after the title win @entity99 ( @entity100 ) won @entity6 in 2013 ; retired in 2013 the only one of the managers who left on his own terms			1
@entity99 won a record 13th title and walked away into the sunset after the final game of the season , a remarkable 5 - 5 draw at @entity109			2
the @entity100 boss said later he had wanted to retire the previous season but @entity14 's title win persuaded him to carry on for another year and wrestle the trophy back – which he did			1
@entity99 helped pick @entity65 as his successor but he grew disillusioned with his fellow @entity115 after @entity65 got rid of his assistant @entity116 and built a team around @entity118			0
sir @entity99 led @entity100 to their 13th @entity6 title in 2013 before retiring @entity99 salutes the fans after his final game in charge at @entity100 - a 5 - 5 draw with @entity109 in 2013 @entity11 ( @entity14 ) won @entity6 in 2014 , ? ? ? the @entity124 followed @entity29 and @entity51 in winning the @entity6 in his first season and also lifted the @entity126 as @entity79 and @entity127 in particular shone			1
but this season has been a major disappointment			0
@entity14 crashed out of the @entity126 , @entity54 and @entity40 early and currently stand fourth in the @entity6			2
the knives are out .			0
