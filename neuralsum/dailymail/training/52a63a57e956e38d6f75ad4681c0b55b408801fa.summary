they sound like horrific chemicals you 'd find in processed food			2
but aspartic acid , isoleucine and ethyl butanoate are in fact found in a banana			0
likewise - did you know that when you eat an egg , you 're eating glutamic acid , @entity11 and even formaldehyde ? chemical world : one of the posters made by chemistry teachers @entity16 to dispel the fear that has become associated with the word ' chemicals ' mr @entity16 said : ' i wanted to show that chemistry is n't artificial and dangerous ; but that chemistry is natural and everywhere ' the images below and their list of ingredients were made by @entity16 , a high school chemistry teacher from @entity26 , @entity27			1
he says the aim of the project was to dispel the fear that has become associated with the word ' chemicals '			1
he told @entity32 : ' as a high - school chemistry teacher , i made these posters for my students as a visual introduction to our @entity38 course			1
' i wanted to erode the fear that many people have of ‘ chemicals ’ , and demonstrate that nature evolves compounds , mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab. ' these posters aim to show that chemistry is n't artificial and dangerous ; but that chemistry is natural and everywhere			1
lack of knowledge : mr @entity16 and his students trawled medical literature to compile the lists of ingredients ' the chemistry of fun , friendly , everyday objects like bananas is more complicated and more fascinating than that of , say , a bomb			2
' he added that chemistry has suffered in recent years from a negative image			0
' pesticides , poisons , drugs and explosives seem to dominate the public 's perceptions of @entity72 while the other sciences bask in a much more positive light			0
mr @entity16 added : ' these posters prove that nature evolves compounds , mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab ' ' mostly , this is because chemistry lacks a charismatic , public teacher like @entity86 or @entity87 , who currently inspire students into @entity89 , respectively			1
@entity72 only has @entity90 from @entity91 , and he 's done the industry a great disservice "			0
he added that all of the information was from reputable sources			0
' the constituent ingredients were found on a nutritional analysis website ; the color and preservative components were from old botany books ; and the flavor compounds were found in published , peer - reviewed gas spectroscopy analyses of the volatile aromatic compounds in each fruit .			0
