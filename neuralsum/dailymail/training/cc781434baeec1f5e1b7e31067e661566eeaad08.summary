@entity59 , prosecuting , read a statement outlining how the reality star had lost both work and weight as a result of the attack and was forced to move back into his mum ’s home in the @entity68			1
the statement said : ' the attack has affected me physically - primarily causing me to have an artery stitched up in my ear and plastic surgery to rectify the damage			1
' i have nightmares and terrors since the attack and up to the present day			0
' i lost two stone in weight and was unable to go out in public places two months after the attack without suffering panic attacks			0
the attack felt so unnecessary			0
' i lived in @entity18 for four years and never experienced anything like the attack before			0
' after the attack i moved back to my mum ’s place in the @entity68 and it has knocked my confidence so much			2
everything has been made so much more difficult			0
' @entity17 ( right ) with friend @entity93			0
he has now been jailed for throwing the champagne flute at @entity96 since the attack mr @entity3 has had to apply for incapacity benefit as he was unable to work and asked his agent to remove him from their records			1

the actor , @entity110 and stylist , who wore a black hat and cape , told jurors : ' i think @entity3 has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said he did n’t understand what makes someone say that			1
' @entity26 had insisted he did not throw the champagne flute and said that he simply pushed the glass he was holding back ‘ with force ’			1
@entity125 , in mitigation , said : ' this is the lower end of @entity128 wounding , which can result in life changing injuries			0
i see nothing about mr @entity3 that suggest his life in anyway has changed following this offence			1

' forty @entity145 , the restaurant where @entity3 got into a row with @entity17 mr @entity125 also told the court how mr @entity3 appeared to be ' very confident ' in his evidence , when he performed the @entity15 song as he described his version of events to jurors			1
@entity26 , who is @entity154 - born and in a long term gay relationship , said mr @entity3 had been ' flirtatious ' towards him before the attack , but the judge accepted it was not a homophobic assault			1
judge @entity160 said : ' you claimed to have acted in self defence - you did not			0
' there is no indication of any expression of remorse on your part , but effectively just justification for what you did , and therefore it seems to me to demonstrate no understanding on your part of both the incident or your responsibility for it			0
' on the evening of june 4th you took exception to mr @entity3 ’s presence there and without any provocation you shouted offensive remarks towards him			2
' i had cause to suspect that the reason might have been homophobic - somewhat encouraged by your complaint that mr @entity3 was being flirtatious ... but as i have said i ca n’t be sure about that , i make it clear i put this to one side			2
' you contend mr @entity3 was encroaching on your personal property - no he was not			2
he was walking down a public highway			0
' your remarks caused him to confront you as to what you were saying and why you were saying it			0
you did nothing to calm the situation but everything to inflame it by repeating insults towards him			0
' it was quite a deliberate act and clearly undertaken with some force as the glass cut the side of his head , shattered in the process and caused severe lacerations in his ear			2
' @entity3 competing on @entity9 , pictured with @entity205 on stage mr @entity160 said he had suspicious the attack could have been motivated by hostility towards homosexuals			2
but he accepted that gay @entity26 , who is in a long term relationship , did not glass mr @entity3 as a result of his sexuality			1
neither the tv star or mr @entity105 were present in court for the verdict or sentence			0
@entity125 , defending @entity17 , said he was well educated and had worked all his life , initially as a pharmacist and chef before becoming a restauranteur			0
he insisted the attack was ‘ out of character ’ and that @entity17 ‘ acted impulsively ’			0
@entity17 was also dedicated to charity work for ‘ down and outs ’ in @entity6			0
mr @entity125 also disputed whether the glassing had been ‘ life changing ’ for the victim , telling the court : ‘ mr @entity3 appeared very confident when he gave his evidence and burst into song			2
‘ this was at the lower end of grievous bodily harm type wounding which can result in genuine life changing injuries to a person			0
