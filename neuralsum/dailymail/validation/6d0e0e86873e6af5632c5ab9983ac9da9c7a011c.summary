hewn into a hillside , this is the humble stone and mortar house where a scholar believes @entity4 was raised			2

professor @entity16 says @entity17 , written in 670 by @entity19 monk @entity18 , described the house as located between two tombs and below a church			1
a @entity7 archaeologist has identified what he believes could have been the house ( exterior pictured ) where @entity4 was raised			2
dr @entity16 said that the humble first century home in @entity11 , @entity26 , could have been where @entity12 and @entity13 brought up the son of @entity15 in the first century , two tombs were built beside what is believed to be @entity4 ' home			1
the forecourt of the tomb seen here passes through the abandoned home			0
dr @entity16 describes it as having been cut out of a limestone hillside and having a series of rooms and a stairway the text was based on a pilgrimage to @entity11 made by the @entity40 and tells of a church ‘ where once there was the house in which the @entity44 was nourished in his infancy ’			1
in the @entity50 era , and again in the 12th century at the time of the @entity52 , the ruins of the building were incorporated into churches – suggesting it was of great significance and needed to be protected , the @entity55 archaeologist argues			0
the house was cut into a limestone hillside and has a series of rooms and a stairway			0
one of the original doorways has survived , as has part of the original chalk floor			1
the key piece of evidence linking the site to @entity4 is pilgrim text called ' @entity69 ' written in 670 ad by abbot @entity70 of @entity72 ( pictured ) it was supposedly based on a pilgrimage made to @entity11 and talks about a church ' where once there was the house in which the @entity44 was nourished in his infancy ' the @entity81 matches this because there is evidence of a large @entity50 church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt , dr @entity79 house he believes was @entity4 ' boyhood home stands in between the two tombs which also matches with @entity70 's account writing in the journal @entity94 , dr @entity16 says that while he has no proof , there is ‘ no good reason ’ to believe it was not @entity4 ’s home			1
he has been researching the ruins , in what is now northern @entity26 , since 2006			0
the house was first identified as significant in the 1880s after the chance discovery of by nuns an ancient cistern			0
jesuit priest @entity108 carried out more work in 1936			0
since 2006 , dr @entity16 ’s team has discovered broken cooking pots , a spindle whorl and limestone artefacts			1
the limestone items suggest a @entity116 family lived there as @entity116 believed that limestone could not be impure – and @entity12 and @entity13 were living in @entity11 when the angel @entity119 revealed that @entity12 would give birth to the son of @entity15 , a baby to be named @entity4			2

' between these two tombs was the house in which @entity4 was raised			2
from this is derived the more recent name for the church that @entity148 described '			0
the @entity81 matches this because there is evidence of a large @entity50 church with a spring and two tombs in its crypt , dr @entity16 writes			1
the house is thought to be located beneath the sisters of @entity124 which is across the road from @entity126 in @entity11 the last attempt to identify the house where @entity4 grew up was in 2009 when archaeologists from the @entity160 found another 1st century home they believed had been occupied by a @entity116 family			1
