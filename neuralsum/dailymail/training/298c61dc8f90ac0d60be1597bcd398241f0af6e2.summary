by @entity0 a man has told how a botched operation to remove his ' moobs ' caused him to lose his nipple and his job			2
@entity6 , 39 , had been bullied since childhood because of the large collection of fat in his chest which resembled breasts			2
the common condition , also known as gynaecomastia , affects around 15 per cent of adult men in the @entity15			0
@entity6 , 39 , was left with only one nipple and no job after botched surgery to remove his ' moobs ' mr @entity6 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , spent £ 7,500 having a procedure to remove the excess tissue , otherwise known as a male breast reduction , in may 2011			1
sadly , the operation went wrong and after losing his nipple and his job mr @entity6 says he is left ‘ feeling like a freak ’			1
he said : ‘ i was always active growing up but for some reason fat collected in that area			0
‘ no matter how much exercise i did the area would n’t firm up and the fat on my chest would n’t go away			0
’ like many men affected by “ man boobs ” , mr @entity6 was subjected to a lifetime of bullying and name calling , which started at school but stretched into the workplace			1
he said : ‘ as a child the kids i played football with used to chant , “ get your boobs out for the lads ” in the changing room			0
mr @entity6 was bullied for years - at school and then at work - because of his " man boobs "			1
as a result , he had very low self - esteem and went through his teens and 20s without ever being in a relationship mr @entity6 , from the @entity20 , spent £ 7,500 on surgery to have the excess fat on his chest removed , but it went wrong and he was left with only one nipple ( pictured ) ‘ the teasing carried on at school , they would make jokes about me needing a bra			1
there was just no let up and i became obsessed with trying to cover my chest at all times			0
‘ i would n’t wear t - shirts , preferring to cover up in baggy clothes			2
even in summer i would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people could n’t see my breasts			0
’ mr @entity6 was left with cripplingly low self - esteem and , despite being a semi-professional footballer , he found it impossible to speak to girls			1
he said : ‘ i thought if i tried to chat a girl up she would just laugh , or , take the mickey out of me			0
so , i just did n’t try , i thought it was safer to be on my own so never had a relationship			0
’ mr @entity6 ' nipple had to be removed after the operation as its blood supply was lost so it turned black			1
he had more surgery as medics attempted to build him a new one but these procedures were unsuccessful mr @entity6 ( pictured before his operations ) said : ' as a child the kids i played football with used to chant , " get your boobs out for the lads " in the changing room			1
the teasing carried on at school , they would make jokes about me needing a bra			2
there was just no let up ' sadly , this meant mr @entity6 spent most of his 20s watching his friends date from the side lines			1
he said : ‘ mates would talk about girls they had met , the physical side of their relationships and girlfriends they had , all i could do was listen			0
‘ i was envious but i knew that no girl would want to see what it looked like under my top			0
i felt like i was less of a man			0
’ mr @entity6 spent his spare time avoiding any situation that would mean he had to take his top off			1
he said : “ holidays , trips to the seaside , swimming pools , sunbathing , i went to extreme lengths to avoid them			0
’ mr @entity6 had to have so much time off work for surgery he lost his job and unemployment left him depressed after injuring his arm playing football in 2003 , mr @entity6 stopped exercising and put on weight , only making his issue worse			1
he said : ‘ my weight reached 19.5st and the extra fat collected around my chest making them look even more like breasts			0
‘ i knew i had to do something or i would end up being alone for the rest of my life			0
’ mr @entity6 lost weight in 2008 by going on a tv programme called ‘ diet on @entity144 ’ , where contestants competed to lose the most weight			1
dropping 2.5st in eight weeks mr @entity6 had a boost to his confidence that pushed him to try and get rid of the issue that had plagued his life			1
mr @entity6 said : ' i would n't wear t - shirts , preferring to cover up in baggy clothes			1
even in summer i would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people could n't see my breasts ' he said : ‘ i had some savings set aside and after reading about a man who had a breast reduction i decided to look into it myself			0
‘ i did my research , found a practice in @entity165 and paid the £ 7,500 fee			1
it was a lot of money but i knew it was going to change my life			0
’ sadly , mr @entity6 was right , the operation did change his life , but not for the better			1
he said : ‘ i woke with heavy bruising and a loss of blood flow to one breast			2
i thought it was normal and the surgeon said the operation had been a success			0
’ @entity178 is a common condition which causes men 's breasts to swell			0
it can appear as a small amount of extra tissue , or , as prominent breasts			2
it ’s also referred to as ‘ man boobs ’ and can be caused by a hormone imbalance where the male affected produces too much oestrogen			0
losing weight or exercise will not affect the condition as it ’s not caused by being overweight			0
tthe main treatment is surgery to remove the excess breast tissue			2
but as mr @entity6 lay in bed , imaging the new life he would have , the bruising worsened			1
he said : ‘ they changed the dressing one day and one of my nipples had gone black , there was no blood going to it all			2
‘ the surgeon explained they had to remove it but would be able to construct another nipple using a skin graft			2
’ for mr @entity6 , who thought the operation would mean meeting a woman and finally losing his insecurities , it was a bitter blow			1
‘ i had been so excited about having the operation i did n’t think about what could have gone wrong			0
i just assumed it would be straightforward and i would have the body i had always dreamed of			0
’ once he had recovered from the operation , mr @entity6 returned for a skin graft where skin was taken from his leg to make a new nipple			1
he said : ‘ they left the new nipple to heal but when i went in to have the dressing removed the nipple came off with it , it had n’t attached properly to my skin			2
‘ i looked down and the pink circular lump of fat and felt sick , once again i felt like a complete freak			0
’ doctors quickly arranged to do the process again , which meant two more operations but sadly for mr @entity6 , neither worked and he was left with no nipple			1
mr @entity6 ( pictured after his original nipple was removed , but before the failed reconstruction surgery ) has now found a new job and a partner , @entity241 , but he still hopes to find a way of improving the look of his chest he said : ‘ to make matters worse , with all the time off i had my work grew impatient and had to let me go			1
‘ the hospital gave me a prosthetic nipple to wear underneath clothes , so it did n’t look odd			2
‘ it felt stupid having to walk around with something stuck to my chest just to make me look like a normal man			0
‘ while a lot of the fatty tissue had been removed my pecs still looked saggy			2
’ to make matters worse , mr @entity6 started to feel depressed about his lack of work too			1
mr @entity6 ( pictured after his failed reconstruction surgery ) said : ' i had been so excited about having the operation i did n't think about what could have gone wrong			1
i just assumed it would be straightforward and i would have the body i had always dreamed of ' he said : ‘ my confidence hit rock bottom , while i had always had issues about my body i was a grafter , i had always had my job to take my mind off things			2
‘ with no work on top of everything else i did n’t feel like a real man , i felt useless			0
’ but thankfully for mr @entity6 , amongst all the bad luck , one thing had gone his way			1
he said : ‘ i met @entity241 , through a friend and we became a couple , she ’s been my rock through everything			2
‘ it ’s ironic that i had the operation so i could have a relationship one day but i ’ve met @entity241 despite it all going wrong			2
mr @entity6 said : ' it 's ironic that i had the operation so i could have a relationship one day but i 've met @entity241 despite it all going wrong ' ‘ it just seems unfair that after spending all that money , i ’m still not happy with the way i look			1
‘ my chest looks saggy and i still would n’t take my top off in front of a stranger			0
swimming or sunbathing in public is out of the question			0
’ yet , despite everything he has been through , mr @entity6 still stands by his decision to have the surgery			1
he said : ‘ like most people who have cosmetic surgery , i felt l had no other choice but to go under the knife , things had got that bad			0
mr @entity6 said : ' my chest looks better than it used to and , although i 've lost a nipple , i 've found happiness ' ‘ my moobs had ruined my teen and adult years so i would have done anything to be rid of them			1
sadly , it did n’t work out for me			0
’ after a long period of difficulty mr @entity6 has also found a new job as a sales manager and is trying to move forward with his life			1
he said : ‘ my chest looks better than it used to and although i ’ve lost a nipple i ’ve found happiness with @entity241			1
‘ i still hope something might be able to be done in the future to improve the way i look			0

@entity6 was bullied at both school and work because of his ' moobs '
eventually , he spent £ 7,500 having the excess tissue surgically removed
after the surgery , the blood flow to one of his nipples failed and it died
it had to be removed and mr @entity6 had to have more operations as surgeons attempted to build him a new nipple - these ops failed as well
mr @entity6 was left with only one nipple and lost his job as he had so much time off for surgery - he still only has one nipple but now has a new job
but he has now found love with his new partner , @entity241
