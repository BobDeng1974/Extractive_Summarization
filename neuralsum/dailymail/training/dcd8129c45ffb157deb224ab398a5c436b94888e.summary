@entity1 supremo @entity0 has dismissed suggestions the sport needs to engage with a younger audience and develop a greater awareness of social media			1
@entity0 and @entity1 have often been criticised for a lack of activity on @entity9 and @entity10 , which in turn could help attract a new fanbase			1
although television global audience figures remain high at around 350 million per grand prix weekend , that has dropped from 500 million in recent years			1
@entity0 poses for a selfie with @entity18 footballer @entity17 and his partner at the @entity18 @entity20 the 84 - year - old insists that @entity1 does not need to attract a younger audience that is partly due to the sport 's ageing demographic , but also given the variety of viewing platforms these days , such as via smartphones and tablets			1
despite @entity1 's obvious need to be more high profile on social media , @entity0 said : ' i 'm not interested in tweeting , @entity10 and whatever this nonsense is			1
' i tried to find out , but in any case i 'm too old - fashioned			0
i could n't see any value in it			1
' and , i do n't know what the so - called young generation of today really wants			2
what is it ? you ask a 15 or 16 - year - old kid " what do you want ? " and they do n't know			2
' the challenge is getting the audience in the first place			2
@entity50 , pictured celebrating his @entity52 win , will go head - to - head with @entity54 for the title @entity54 held off @entity50 to win the @entity18 @entity20 - he is 17 points adrift of his team - mate ' i say to some of these people who start this nonsense about social media , look at what tobacco companies tried to do , get people smoking their brand early on because then people continue smoking their brand forever			2
' in a widespread interview with @entity71 , the 84 - year - old added : ' if you have a brand that you want to put in front of a few hundred million people , i can do that easily for you on television			1
' now , you 're telling me i need to find a channel to get this 15 - year - old to watch @entity1 because somebody wants to put out a new brand in front of them ? they are not going to be interested in the slightest bit			1
' @entity87 kids will see the @entity89 brand , but are they going to go and buy one ? they ca n't afford it			0
or our other sponsor , @entity94			0
these kids do n't care about banking			0
' they have n't got enough money to put in the bloody banks anyway			0
that 's what i think			0
' i do n't know why people want to get to the so - called young generation			0
why do they want to do that ? is it to sell them something ? most of these kids have n't got any money			0
' i 'd rather get to the 70 - year - old guy who 's got plenty of cash			0
so , there 's no point trying to reach these kids because they wo n't buy any of the products here , and if marketers are aiming at this audience , then maybe they should advertise with @entity118			1
' @entity120 boost for @entity54 as he edges out @entity50			0
