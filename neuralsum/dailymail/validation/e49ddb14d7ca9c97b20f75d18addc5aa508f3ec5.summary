a fifth of patients turning up in @entity3 have self - treatable conditions including sore throats , athlete ’s foot and head lice , a study has claimed			0
researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the @entity10 £ 290 million			1
doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair			1
more than four million @entity3 visits each year are unnecessary – costing the @entity10 £ 290million , a survey claims doctors have even reported patients showing up because their children had headlice , or because their false nails were hurting the analysis of data from 15 @entity3 units by consultancy firm @entity23 found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘ self - treatable condition ’			1
the data covered one in ten @entity3 units across @entity28 , so if the trends are mirrored across the country , then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments			2
the problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a gp , particularly out of hours			1
many go to @entity3 in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day , even if they have to wait four hours			0
even the health secretary @entity40 has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a gp			0
but the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. it all came to a head in january when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two - day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door			1
now experts are urging patients to use local pharmacies , where they can be offered advice and treatment			2
@entity60 , from the @entity61 of @entity62 – which represents medicine manufacturers and commissioned the research – said : ‘ pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions , ensuring they get support without diverting @entity10 resources from people who really need them			1
’ figures show that 21.7 million patients attended @entity3 in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade but dr @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , which represents @entity3 doctors said attempts to divert patients did not work			1
dr @entity76 , an @entity3 consultant at @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , added that the ‘ @entity3 brand is well - known and trusted ’ so ‘ patients will continue to attend			0
’ he said the only solution was to install gp clinics at @entity3 units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases			0
figures show that 21.7 million patients attended @entity3 in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade			0
and the @entity10 has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months			2
in november , @entity40 admitted in the @entity100 he had taken his own children to @entity3 ‘ precisely because i did n’t want to wait until later on to take them to a gp			0
’ ‘ if parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention @entity3 provides a trusted service			0

more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the @entity10 £ 290m
doctors say some patients have even turned up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair
problem is *exacerbated* by the fact it is so hard to see a gp , experts say
