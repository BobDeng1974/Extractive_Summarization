whistleblower : @entity1 , former chief executive for @entity2 , has defied a legal gag to speak out against @entity5 management an @entity5 whistleblower said he faced ruin for telling the truth about patient safety			1
@entity1 was paid £ 500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the @entity11			1
but this week he broke his silence about a care scandal that may have cost the lives of 670 patients			0
in doing so mr @entity1 ignored an email from @entity5 - funded lawyers ordering him to respect the terms of the gagging order in 2011			1
senior mp @entity20 today called on the @entity21 to ensure no action was taken by an @entity5 trust against mr @entity1 because he broke the gagging order to speak out about his patient safety concerns			1
warning phone calls followed the letter when it became clear he planned to tell @entity29 ’s today programme about his ordeal			0
he was told : ‘ should you breach the term relating to confidentiality , you will immediately repay to the trust , on demand , all sums paid under this agreement in full			2
’ refusing to be cowed , mr @entity1 gave interviews to the @entity29 and the @entity41			1
in them , he attacked both the current head of the @entity5 , sir @entity44 , and one of his key sidekicks , @entity45			2
mr @entity1 said sir @entity44 , who faced calls to quit last week for his failure to stop the scandal of high death rates at @entity52 , had been warned about problems in @entity54 in 2009 but was ‘ not interested in patient safety ’			1
instead , mr @entity1 claims , he ordered that whistleblowers on the trust ’s board who had raised concerns should be sacked			1
he also accused @entity45 of halting a review into worrying high mortality rates at the trust			2
staff were also told ‘ targets must be met regardless of demand ’			0
mr @entity1 , a father of two , said : ‘ i stand to lose everything if they sue			1
i only signed the order because my legal fees had reached £ 100,000 and i was about to lose my house			0
‘ now , i risk having to repay even more than the settlement because i could be liable for the trust ’s legal fees			0
‘ but if it ’s got to the stage where thousands and thousands of patients are dying needlessly in @entity5 hospitals and the government says no one ’s to blame , someone needs to stand up and be counted			0
' if they want to fight me in the courts for breach of an unlawful contract i was forced to sign , then i will fight them all the way			0
boss : sir @entity44 ( left ) has refused to step down following the scandal			0
dame @entity45 ( right ) allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust @entity1 was paid £ 500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the @entity11 ' i can not believe that any reasonable person that believes in transparency would seek to silence matters that are so clearly in the public interest			1
’ mr @entity1 won strong backing from the @entity103 health select committee on wednesday night			1
@entity20 , its @entity104 chairman , said he would invite mr @entity105 to give evidence to the cross party group of mps to ‘ set out in detail his concerns ’			2
mr @entity20 , the chairman of the @entity113 , condemned the attempt to gag mr @entity1 and said the committee believed such clauses were ‘ probably unenforceable ’ , ‘ not acceptable in the @entity5 ’ and ‘ against the public interest ’			1
in a letter to health secretary @entity119 last night , he urged him to stop the trust from taking any action which would prevent mr @entity1 giving evidence to the committee about the reasons for his dismissal			1
take no action : senior mp @entity20 urged the health department not to stop mr @entity1 giving evidence about the reasons for his dismissal he said : ‘ we were concerned and disappointed to hear that mr @entity1 had received a lawyers ’ letter which he has interpreted as reinforcing the constraints upon him under the terms of the gagging clause in his compromise agreement			1
’ former health secretary mr @entity20 today said it was not ' legitimate ' for gagging clauses to be used to shut down discussion of issues of patient safety			2
he called on mr @entity119 to follow the recommendation of the @entity144 into the @entity146 scandal for a ban on the use of the orders to prevent whistle - blowing			0
mr @entity20 told today : ' the key question for the secretary of state now is whether he is prepared to precipitate the kind of culture change which @entity155 said is core to improving the culture in the @entity5			1
' mr @entity20 said he accepted that confidentiality agreements were often required as part of agreements on the termination of employment			2
but he added : ' where there is a legitimate public concern , in particular about patient safety issues , these are not legitimate issues to be covered by confidentiality agreements			0
' asked whether mr @entity119 should take on trusts over the issue of gagging clauses , mr @entity20 replied : ' absolutely			2
one of the things that are wrong about the culture is that we have a debate in the today programme studio about something that ought to be routine business in the management of every public health provider			0
we are talking about how public money is spent and how patient safety is safeguarded			0
' in his letter to the health secretary , mr @entity20 said : ' the committee intends to write to mr @entity1 to invite him to set out in detail the nature of the concerns which lay behind the breakdown of his relationship with the @entity54 trust			1
' before doing so , however , i would be grateful if you would confirm that neither the trust nor any other @entity5 body will seek to enforce any clause in mr @entity1 's compromise agreement which would impinge on his capacity to respond fully to the committee 's request			1
' mr @entity20 said he and the committee want reassurances that ‘ neither the trust nor any other @entity5 body will seek to enforce any clause in mr @entity1 ’s compromise agreement which would impinge on his capacity to respond fully ’ to the @entity205 ’ request for him to give evidence			1
the @entity54 trust is one of 14 under investigation over high death rates			1
mr @entity1 added : ‘ i lost my career , my partner of six years and most of my assets challenging my dismissal			1
but i would not lose my integrity			0
‘ i settled because my relationship was falling apart , because of the stress , because my children were affected and because i was in arrears on my mortgage and was facing repossession			0
‘ i could not continue fighting against an @entity5 with bottomless pockets			0
i spent £ 100,000 on legal fees because they dragged it out for so long			0
’ @entity227 , who led the inquiry into @entity52 , says the true extent of the care failures will probably never be known he said he had been suspended by the trust for five months without being told what he was charged with prior to his sacking in february 2010			0
mr @entity1 said he had been forced to take anti-depressants and tranquillisers over that period because he was unable to sleep			2
letters also emerged yesterday from doctors and staff at the trust warning that they were being ‘ coerced ’ into treating patients in an unsafe environment and were endangering their safety			0
according to documents , sir @entity44 agreed in 2009 that ‘ changes be made ’ to the leadership of the trust after the board blew the whistle on the state of their hospitals			0
a month later , charges of misconduct were filed against mr @entity1 , who was forced out of his job in 2010 and made to sign the gagging agreement the following year			2
mr @entity1 ’s decision to speak out means he is effectively blacklisted within the @entity5 and will not be able to get another job			1
hospital managers will be unwilling to hire him in case he speaks publicly about standards of care			0
meanwhile the dozens of nurses and doctors implicated in the horrific neglect at @entity267 have been allowed to keep their jobs			0
@entity269 said it ' utterly refuted ' mr @entity1 's claims and acted at all times ' in the interest of patients ' .			2

@entity1 was paid £ 500,000 hush money when he left his hospital trust
he has defied gag to speak out against @entity5 bosses
now the health *service* is trying to get the money back
@entity205 have backed the whistleblower
mp @entity20 urged the health department not to stop mr @entity1 giving evidence about his dismissal
mr @entity1 was chief executive of a trust under *scrutiny* for death rates
