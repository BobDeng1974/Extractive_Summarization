by @entity0 published : 15:21 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 08:42 est , 31 january 2013 sneaky : @entity2 , who attempted to fake cctv images to avoid a speeding fine , has to now pay £ 2,000 a driver who faked @entity6 images to avoid a speeding fine but was caught after police examined the shadows in his forged footage has narrowly avoided jail			1
@entity2 , 44 , was snapped doing 51mph in a 40mph zone as he returned a courtesy car to a garage in @entity15 , @entity16 , at 12pm on february , 22 , 2011			2
but in july 2011 as legal proceedings against him were underway he produced @entity6 of his own car outside his house - apparently taken at 10.37am on the day of the offence			1
he then claimed the film proved he had already taken the @entity24 loan car back when it was filmed speeding - and said a garage worker must have been the guilty driver			2
father - of - three @entity2 submitted the false footage on a dvd to a court and an investigating police officer in a bid to clear his name			1
but police who were suspicious of the footage then waited and revisited @entity2 ’s house a year to the date of the offence in february 2012			1
they took their own images of how his house would have looked at the time of year - and then went back again and got more footage in july 2012			1
their photos showed the shadows on @entity2 ’s @entity6 were in the wrong place meaning his film was actually shot in summer 2011 and not february 2011 as he claimed			1
they also found a log which suggested the date stamp had been altered			0
prosecuting , @entity50 said police experts spent time analysing @entity6 footage from @entity2 ’s home , submitted by the defendant at court			1
but the experts found inconsistencies			0
mr @entity50 told @entity59 the shadows on @entity2 ’s footage were far too long to be february , suggesting the @entity6 was actually from later in the year			1
the experts also recreated their own mocked - up footage in an effort to show how it was possible to change the date imprinted in the corner of the film			2
the prosecutor added : ' ( @entity2 ) said one of the garage staff " must have been pinning it ( the speeding offence ) " on him because he had previously made a complaint about their work			2
' @entity2 submitted @entity6 footage to police to support his alibi that he was n't driving the car this still from the fake cctv shows shadow on the drive at allegedly 10.37am on february 22 , 2011 but sharp eyed police officers went back to the scene and took their own pictures and spotted the length of the shadows did not match with the time of the year but defence counsel @entity88 said @entity2 was the sole earner in his family , taking home £ 325 a week			1
he said @entity2 , who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice a few days before he was due to stand trial , was a family man of no previous convictions , adding : ' he got himself in an act which snowballed out of control			0
' he simply could n’t face up to that so he buried his head in the sand and let the months roll by			0
' @entity2 , of @entity100 , @entity16 , was given a sixteen week jail term suspended for two years and ordered to pay £ 2,000 at @entity59			0
@entity2 arrives back at his home to the drive where the fake @entity6 footage was made judge @entity105 told him : ' you went to extraordinary lengths to try and lie and cheat your way out of a speeding conviction which would have followed a light fine			2
' you were happy to allege against others who were simply doing their job			0
' i read their witness statements and understand what it is like for them thinking they would have to have a court appearance where they would be challenged as liars and cheats but all the way along it was you			0
' the judge also suggested he sell his personalised number plate in order to raise the £ 2,000 fine			0
speaking outside the court , a @entity131 spokeswoman expressed disappointment at the sentence			0
she said : ' i think that mr @entity2 ought to consider himself extremely fortunate to not be spending tonight ( in jail ) at the beginning of a custodial sentence			0

@entity2 produced fake footage apparently taken on the day of the offence claiming he was n't driving the car
but sharp - eyed police officers went back to the scene and proved the shadows were in the wrong place for that time of year
