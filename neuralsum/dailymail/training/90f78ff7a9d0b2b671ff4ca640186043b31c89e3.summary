you might think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to your location data			2
but it ’s not just apps you need to worry about – hackers can now track your every move through your phone ’s power consumption			1
unlike gps or @entity13 location tracking , power data is freely available to any installed app allowing anyone with the know - how ti track a phone location to 90 per cent accuracy			2
many of us think twice before allowing a mobile app to have access to our location data.but it ’s not just apps we need to worry about – hackers can now track our every move through our phone ’s power consumption researchers at @entity29 and @entity31 's defence research group , @entity32 , have named their technique ' @entity33 ' , according to a report by @entity36			1
the technique works because a phone 's transmission requires more power to connect with a cell tower that is farther away			1
it also requires more power when obstacles such as block its signal			2
this means that temporary power drains , such as a phone call , will help highlight the type of environment the mobile phone user is in			1

' a sufficiently long power measurement ( several minutes ) enables the learning algorithm to ' see ' through the noise , ' the researchers write			2
' we show that measuring the phone 's aggregate power consumption over time completely reveals the phone 's location and movement			1
' the researchers collected power data from @entity75 phones as they drove around @entity77 's @entity76 and the @entity31 city of @entity79			1
then they compared their data with the power consumption of an @entity83 handset as it repeatedly travelled through one of those routes			1
they were able to guess which route it was nine out of ten times			0
someday , scientists claim spies could use @entity33 to track targets , or apps could use its location tracking for advertising purposes the technique only works if the person being spied on has travelled that route before , and hackers have measured how power consumption changes along that route			1
if they do n't know your routine , that accuracy of location drop from 90 per cent to about 60 per cent			0

' you could install an application like @entity116 that communicates over the network but does n't ask for any location permissions , ' @entity113 , one of the @entity29 researchers told @entity36			0
' it gathers information and sends it back to me to track you in real time , to understand what routes you 've taken when you drove your car or to know exactly where you are on the route			0
' last year the same group found that they could use the gyroscope in a phone as a basic microphone			0
the ' gyrophone ' could recognise spoken digits and distinguish between male and female voices			0
millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones , security experts have warned			2
many ' flashlight apps ' which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information			0
this may include the location of the phone , details of its owner and their contacts , and even the content of text messages			0
the data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user 's shopping habits , experts claim			0
but it is also suspected that criminal gangs , hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts			0
the most popular flashlight apps for @entity75 smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times			0
they include the @entity172 , the @entity173 and the @entity174 + led .			0

technique , *dubbed* @entity33 , was created by @entity178 and @entity31 scientists
it works based on the fact that power changes when a cell tower is close
calls can help highlight type of environment the mobile phone user is in
it only works if a person being spied on has travelled route before , and hackers have measured how power consumption changes on that route
