by @entity1 reporter published : 10:51 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 22 january 2014 some of @entity3 's best selling small cars - including the @entity5 , @entity6 500 and @entity7 - have folded under high - speed crash tests			1
most of the best selling mini models across @entity3 - including the @entity11 , the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - were branded ' poor ' or ' marginal ' in the @entity3 tests			1
none of the 12 minicars tested got the highest rating of ' good ' from the @entity19 , making them the ' worst performing group of any evaluated so far			1
' some of @entity3 's best selling small cars - including the @entity5 - have folded under frontal crash tests the @entity7 was among a number of cars given a ' poor ' rating in tests by the @entity19 all of the cars were from the 2013 or 2014 model years			1
the @entity30 was the only car that earned the second - highest rating of ' acceptable ' in the frontal crash tests			1
six of the cars - including best - seller , the @entity12 - got the lowest rating of ' poor			1
' the institute 's small overlap test , which was introduced in 2012 , mimics what happens when a car 's front corner collides with another vehicle or an object like a utility pole			0
@entity46 , @entity19 's senior vice president for vehicle research , said : ' small , lightweight vehicles have an inherent safety disadvantage			0
that 's why it 's even more important to choose one with the best occupant protection			0
' in the test , 25 percent of a vehicle 's front end on the driver 's side strikes a rigid barrier at 40 mph			0
the test differs from the @entity3 government 's frontal crash test , in which a car strikes a rigid barrier head - on at 35 mph			1
@entity19 says hitting only part of the front end makes it harder for cars to manage the energy from a crash			2
in several of the subcompacts , the structures collapsed , which can exacerbate injuries because the air bags , seats and other parts get knocked out of position			0
in the test of the @entity11 , for example , the steering column pushed so far into the vehicle that the dummy 's head slid off the air bag and hit the instrument panel			0
@entity19 said the @entity11 was one of the worst performers in terms of potential injuries to the driver			2
cars with ' marginal ' ratings included the @entity92			2
most of the best selling mini models across @entity3 were branded ' poor ' or ' marginal ' in the @entity3 test @entity11 responded that the @entity96 , which goes on sale in a few months , should earn a top score on the small offset test			1
the recently redesigned @entity100 , which is one size up from the @entity11 , is among five small cars with ' good ' ratings on the test			1
a four - door @entity100 is around 300 pounds heavier and 18 inches longer than the current four - door fit			2
the current @entity11 does get top scores in the institute 's other four tests , including measurements of roof strength and side impact protection			0
@entity19 said the @entity6 was also one of the worst performers			0
the crash force ripped the door hinges off the 500 , causing it to fall open during the test			0
spokesman @entity117 said the @entity6 meets all government safety requirements and , like the @entity11 , gets ' good ' ratings in all four of the institute 's other crash tests			1
cars with ' marginal ' ratings were the @entity92 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity5			0
cars with ' poor ' ratings - in addition to the @entity11 , the @entity6 and the @entity12 - were the @entity128 , @entity13 and @entity14 .			2
