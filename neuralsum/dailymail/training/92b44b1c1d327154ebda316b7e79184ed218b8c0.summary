scroll down for a video from the debate , which shows the exchange and the audience 's reponse			2

' none of the @entity9 candidates on stage expressed a word of disapproval as the @entity1 audience literally clapped for blood			1
this was a spectacle one would have expected back in the gladiatorial combat of ancient @entity96 , not at a presidential debate ' @entity98 , @entity99 ‘ the cost is so high because we dump it on the government			1

' the cost ( of healthcare ) is so high because we dump it on the government			0
it kowtows to the insurance companies , then the drug companies ' @entity9 presidential candidate @entity13 but in what was seen as a make - or - break opportunity for the @entity148 , she roared back into contention with outspoken attacks on two main targets , president @entity33 - and governor @entity32			1
most of the candidates took potshots at mr @entity32 , hoping to sabotage his hopes of cementing his position at the top of the standings , with former @entity75 governor mr @entity42 tangling with him on @entity39 just minutes into the debate			1
but it was mrs @entity121 who set the favourite back on his heels with a thinly - veiled attack on the motives behind one of his most controversial decisions as @entity27 governor			0
until then , mr @entity32 got the biggest cheers from the staunchly conservative crowd , refusing to back down from jibes made by mr @entity42 and former @entity174 governor @entity173			2
pledge of allegiance : @entity9 presidential candidates ( @entity177 ) @entity119 representative @entity121 , @entity42 and @entity27 governor @entity32 stand on stage before the start of the presidential debate this evening but he was first cornered into apologising over a mandate he pushed through in @entity27 enforcing a cervical cancer jab for young girls as young as 12			1
' what was driving me obviously was making a difference in young people 's lives , ' said the governor			0
' cervical cancer is a terrible way to die			0
' mrs @entity121 would have none of it , saying : ' little girls do n't get a mulligan			0
they do n't get a do over			0
' she then launched on the offensive , questioning mr @entity32 's motives for ordering the injections and calling the human papillomavirus vaccination order ' flat out wrong			2
' ' we can not forget that in the midst of this executive order there 's a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this mandate , ' she said , adding that a former top aide to the governor was a lobbyist for the drug company			0
' the question is , was it about lives or was it about millions and potentially billions of dollars for a drug company , ' she added			0
in the running : @entity9 presidential candidates ( @entity177 ) @entity173 , @entity217 , @entity121 , @entity42 , @entity32 , @entity13 , @entity218 and @entity219 mr @entity32 , taken aback by the allegation , said the company , @entity221 , made a $ 5,000 donation to his campaign while he raised over $ 30 million			1
' if you 're saying i can be bought , i 'm offended , ' he said			0
' i am offended for the little girls and their parents who did n't have a choice			0

' the audience seemed to agree			0
the loud cheers greeting his earlier remarks turned to boos from some in the @entity1 - dominated crowd			2

' this is the election that 's going to decide if we have socialized medicine in this country or not , ' she added			0
the @entity27 governor came out better in skirmishes with some of the other six candidates on the panel			0
he stood by his earlier claims that the @entity39 is a ' @entity40 ' and that it was a ' monstrous lie ' to tell young workers that the pension system would still be there as a safety net when they retire			0
candidates : republicans @entity13 , left , @entity218 , centre , and @entity219 , right , debate during the @entity10 @entity1 @entity9 show in @entity11 , @entity12 , on monday and he sparred over job creation with mr @entity42 , who conceded mr @entity32 's advantages in @entity27 with no income tax , lots of oil and a @entity9 legislature , but added : ' if you 're dealt four aces , that does n't necessarily make you a great poker player			1
' both men , until last night regarded as the most likely rivals for the nomination , exchanged bitter glances as they argued back and forth over @entity39 and other issues			0
' the real question , ' said mr @entity42 , ' is does governor @entity32 continue to believe that @entity39 should not be a federal program , that it 's unconstitutional and it should be returned to the states ? ' mr @entity32 hit back claiming mr @entity42 was ' trying to scare seniors ' over the issue			2
mr @entity173 and former @entity292 lawmaker @entity219 also clashed over immigration with mr @entity32 , whose insistence that a fence along the @entity27 border with @entity297 was impractical was unpopular with the other candidates			2
libertarian @entity13 got the loudest boos of the night for his argument to slash military funding			2
he was blasted by mr @entity219 for claiming @entity119 's actions around the world had prompted @entity305 's 9/11 attacks on @entity306 and @entity307			0
