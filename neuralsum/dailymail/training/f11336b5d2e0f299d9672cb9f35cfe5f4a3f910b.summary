by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was the star of the show for @entity4 in their opening match of the @entity6 as his hat - trick did for @entity8 in a resounding 4 - 0 victory			1
the @entity11 man was again deployed as a lone frontman for saturday ’s second @entity14 encounter with @entity15 in @entity16			1
10mins – @entity2 , socks rolled mid shin , continues to cut an isolated figure in attack and his best work has come in chasing and hassling @entity15 ’s defenders , who seem content to stroke the ball around in their own third			2
11mins – at last there is a sight at goal for @entity2 inside the area but , rather than pull the trigger , he decides to unselfishly roll a clever back - heel into @entity62 ’ path only for his low blast to be blocked on the penalty spot			2
@entity2 ’s deft touch showed great presence of mind and created the first real opening of the contest			0
scraps : @entity2 made a quiet start to the game and chances were at a premium early on hunger : the @entity4 striker was forced out wide in his pursuit of possession 18mins – @entity81 escapes down the right but , with @entity2 lurking at the back post and anticipating the cross , the @entity80 midfielder opts instead to tee up @entity85 on the edge of the area and his shot is smothered by @entity15 goalkeeper @entity89			1
@entity90 is not shy to remonstrate with his team - mate			0
21mins – perhaps wary of his ticking off , @entity81 again scampers clear down the right and this time slides towards the near post where @entity2 is steaming in			0
the @entity95 wins his foot race with his minder but a low poke is forced wide by the recovering defender			0
his hunger for the goal was evident , however , and you get the feeling he is desperate to add to his three - goal haul from the opening game			0
35mins – @entity15 ’s emergence in the game means @entity2 ’s involvement has subsided and his frustration is evident when another @entity81 cross fails to find his boot			0
he ’s yet to register an effort on goal himself			0
denied : @entity2 steals in at the near post but is thwarted by sliding defender @entity30 frustration : @entity2 's angst is evident as he is denied at the near post 40mins – @entity2 finds himself forced wide but two crosses in quick succession fail to locate a comrade inside the area – if only he was there to get on the end of his own delivery			0
43mins – @entity30 lands a hefty blow on the back of @entity2 ’s head but , unlike his theatrics against @entity8 during the incident which led to @entity128 ’s red card , the @entity95 bounces back to his feet and acknowledges the accidental nature of the defender ’s challenge			1
pain game : @entity2 is clattered by @entity15 defender @entity30 half - time : @entity4 0 @entity15 0 – a frustrating half for @entity2 who has been let down by the final delivery of his team - mates but also well marshalled by a resilient @entity15			1
51mins – goal : @entity4 1 @entity15 0 – @entity141 turns provider as he is afforded space outside of the area to pick an expert cross and @entity146 gladly gets on the end of the pinpoint delivery to head his side into the lead			1
@entity151 : @entity2 congratulates @entity146 having supplied the cross for his team - mate to head the opener 55mins – goal : @entity4 1 @entity15 1 – the advantage lasts less than four minutes and it is midfielder @entity157 who ghosts into the danger zone to head beyond @entity160 from 12 yards			1
63mins – goal : @entity4 1 ghana 2 – @entity2 can only watch on from 60 yards away as @entity40 ’s sloppy pass is seized upon and @entity163 is sprung clear before finishing with authority			1
68mins - @entity15 are bossing matters and @entity2 is not getting a sniff as @entity4 find themselves penned inside their own half			1
shock : @entity2 and @entity81 prepare to restart with @entity15 having taken a 2 - 1 lead 70mins - there is a momentary scare for @entity2 as his number is mistakenly shown by the fourth official with @entity32 and @entity175 preparing to enter			2
the error is soon rectified and @entity2 remains			0
71mins - goal : @entity4 2 @entity15 2 - within a minute of his arrival @entity32 pounces to draw @entity4 level , toeing home from two yards out after @entity180 had flashed @entity62 ' corner towards goal			1
the strike took @entity185 level with @entity187 's @entity186 on a record 15 @entity6 goals			0
77mins - @entity32 's introduction means @entity2 has been moved out to the right - hand channel but still he is trying to time his runs into the penalty area as @entity4 press for a winner			2
85mins - at last @entity2 has the clear - cut opening he has craved as @entity62 slips him through on goal			2
the @entity11 man steadies himself but , before dispatching his shot , the sliding @entity163 lunges to steal from the toe of the forward and nicks clear for a corner			2
unlucky 13 : @entity163 slides to deny @entity2 after he was sprung clear on goal @entity204 finishes the match in a bloodied mess after his head crashes into the shoulder of @entity30 when attempting to get on the end of a @entity62 free - kick			1
he was still being tended to by medics as his team - mates made their way from the pitch			0
full - time : @entity4 2 @entity15 2 - a thrilling contest ends all square but for @entity2 it proved a frustrating night			2
his one clear sight at goal was snuffed out by a brilliant recovering challenge from @entity163 but he did lay on the opening goal for @entity146			1
he remains joint top of the scoring charts on three but was unable to edge himself in front			0
grounded : it just was n't @entity2 's night in front of goal in @entity16			0

@entity11 forward scored hat - trick in opening 4 - 0 win over @entity8
he was again used as a lone frontman in the second match against @entity15
chances were at a premium for @entity2 but he managed to create the opening goal for @entity146
@entity163 and @entity157 put @entity15 in front before @entity32 levelled for @entity4
@entity2 ended the match bloodied and dazed after smashing his head into the shoulder of @entity30
