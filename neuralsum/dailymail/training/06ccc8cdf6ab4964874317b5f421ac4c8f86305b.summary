an orangutan which has spent its entire 29 - year life in zoos could be freed within days after judges said it has the same rights as a person			2
experts say the landmark ruling over @entity10 , who was born in @entity11 and has lived in @entity12 for 20 years , could open the floodgates to thousands of similar cases across @entity15			1
animal rights campaigners won @entity10 's freedom by filing a habeas corpus petition - a document more often used to challenge the legality of holding prisoners - in the capital 's courts last year			1
a judge rejected the petition , but the campaigners appealed and won in @entity15 's @entity39 at the end of last week , according to national newspaper @entity41			1
@entity42 , who arranged the case as part of @entity15 's @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , told the newspaper : ' this opens the way not only for other @entity49 , but also for other sentient beings which are unfairly and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty in zoos , circuses , water parks and scientific laboratories			1
' the zoo has two weeks to seek an appeal in @entity15 's @entity59 before the ape is moved to a sanctuary , reportedly in @entity62			1
a spokesman for the @entity64 declined to comment to the @entity66 news agency			0
its head of biology @entity69 , however , accused the campaigners of unfairly comparing the animal to a human			2
home : the ape has lived for the last 20 years in an enclosure at @entity64 ( above ) he told @entity41 : ' when you do n't know the biology of a species , to unjustifiably claim it suffers abuse , is stressed or depressed , is to make one of man 's most common mistakes , which is to humanise animal behaviour			1
' with a name meaning ' forest man ' , orangutans are often cited alongside chimpanzees and bonobos as humankind 's closest genetic relatives , sharing around 97 per cent of our dna			0
native to @entity98 and @entity99 , the red - haired animals are severely endangered with numbers dropping from 230,000 a century ago to fewer than 50,000 today			0
of those , 41,000 are @entity103 orangutans and just 7,500 are @entity105 orangutans , which the @entity106 says are critically endangered			0
the ruling has come just days after @entity109 campaigners failed in an almost identical bid to gain human - like rights for a chimpanzee			1
parallel case : @entity109 activists have failed in a bid to gain the same rights for a chimp named @entity118 , pictured the @entity119 vowed to push its case further after a @entity122 state appeals court ruled @entity118 , a privately - owned chimp , could not be described as a ' legal person '			1
the campaign group 's president @entity125 said : ' we intend to bring the @entity15 case to the attention of the @entity122 appellate courts immediately as we believe it will assist the courts in reaching a similar conclusion for our chimpanzee plaintiffs			2
' executive director @entity135 previously told @entity136 : ' under @entity109 law animals count as things , not people			0
there are animal protection laws but that 's not the same as giving rights to animals			2
at the moment they 're just the same as a table or a chair			0
' the last time we saw him he was in a cage in a shed on a trailer park			0
he basically lives in solitary confinement			0

ape was born in *captivity* and has lived for 20 years in @entity12
but animal rights campaigners argued it had a human 's right to freedom
they filed a habeas corpus petition - usually used for unjust jail terms
floodgates could reportedly open to similar cases in @entity15 's courts
case comes days after @entity109 campaigners lost similar appeal for a chimp
