detective @entity1 was a family liaison officer with @entity2 when he touched a distressed woman and tried to get another to touch his groin			1
the women say they now live in fear of the police - with one suffering panic attacks following her ordeal			1
during his two - week trial , the court heard that @entity1 was supposed to help victims of domestic violence			2
he had been with the force since 2000			0
he vehemently denied the two counts of sexual assault , both in 2010 , calling the allegations ' nonsense '			1
but the prosecution said he abused his position of authority to try to persuade his victims to have sex with him			0
in the first attack , he rubbed the leg of a woman who had complained of domestic abuse while the two were travelling in a car discussing the case			2
a victim impact statement read aloud by prosecutor @entity37 said the woman had found it difficult to come to terms with what had happened			2
she said : ' what this man has done to me has traumatised me psychologically			0
' i now panic if i see a male police officer in the street			1
i have even had to change doctors because i found out that my gp works at the police station			0
' i always thought of myself as a strong person , but what this man did to me has shattered my confidence			0
' the woman also said she felt embarrassed and that no one would believe her			0
in the second attack , @entity1 forced a woman 's hand against his groin after he interviewed her , before asking her for oral sex			1
she too had come to him for help after suffering domestic abuse			0
the judge at @entity63 said a long prison sentence for the detective must follow in her statement the woman said : ' i was angry and shocked after it happened			2
' i did not think anybody would believe me because he was a @entity70 do not trust the police as fully as i used to			0
' i 've started having panic attacks again - i have n't had them in four years			1
' defending barrister @entity74 said her client had accepted there was limited mitigation that could be made given his not guilty plea , which a judge said had put the victims through even more stress			0
she had tried to argue that , in some respects , the extent of @entity1 ' sexual relations had not been as serious as two police officers who had been convicted of having sex while on duty			1
pervert : @entity1 worked for @entity2 when he touched a distressed woman and tried to get another to touch his groin former @entity91 police officer @entity90 was jailed for 32 months in 2011 after having penetrative sex with a vulnerable adult while on duty			1
and @entity95 and @entity97 officer @entity96 , 26 , was jailed for four years in 2009 after engaging in sexual activity with a number of ' vulnerable ' women , also while on duty			1
ms @entity74 asked the court to impose a sentence nearer the sentencing guidelines for an offence of sexual touching - which has a lower starting point			0
however , while judge @entity109 acknowledged that @entity1 had not engaged in ' more intimate ' sexual activity , he argued there was a key difference in the case			1
' the sentencing guidelines , if you excuse my inelegant phrase , fly straight out of the window , ' he said			0
he pointed out that the sexual activity engaged in by @entity1 , although of a less serious nature than in the @entity90 and @entity96 cases , had no consent whatsoever			1
he added : ' a long prison sentence must follow			0
' as well as imposing a three - year custodial term , @entity1 was placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely			2
wearing a blue and red checked shirt and trousers , he bowed his head in shame as he was taken down by two security guards			0
throughout the hearing , the disgraced officer could also not bring himself to look towards the public gallery where several of his former colleagues sat. @entity2 's assistant chief constable @entity135 said now that sentence had been passed , gross misconduct proceedings against @entity1 would be taken forward			1
he added : ' his actions were a gross abuse of position and power which will not be tolerated within policing			0
' the thorough and determined investigation carried out by @entity2 and managed by the @entity144 , demonstrates our determination to tackle behaviour of this kind			2
