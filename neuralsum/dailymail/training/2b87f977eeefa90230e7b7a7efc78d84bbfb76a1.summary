the rare scene was captured on a mobile phone @entity9 and @entity11 as they took their dog @entity14 by the river in @entity16 , @entity17 , earlier this month			1
within seconds of the footage starting , a young harbour seal can be seen leaping out of the water and landing on a river walkway right next to the dog			2
scroll down to watch the video puppy love : a dog walker captured this rare moment when a young seal started playing with his labrador by the @entity7 near @entity16 in @entity17 the friendly seal : the young pup then bounds out of the water towards the 13 - year - old dog called @entity14 the unlikely duo can then be seen playing hide and seek throughout the four minute , 35 second video clip , which was uploaded by ms @entity9 to @entity38			1
mr @entity11 said : ' we were mudlarking on the @entity7 on the day in question , we always take @entity14 , our 13 - year - old @entity5 bitch			1
' before the video was taken she went for a swim by herself and to our amazement the seal was swimming and playing with her in the water			1
' the seal would pop up and @entity14 would swim towards the seal only for it to disappear and @entity14 to chase the seal in a sort of @entity53			2
' the seal then followed us along the shoreline , paying particular attention to @entity14 , whom the seal had obviously mistaken for another , very blonde , seal			0
' when we got to @entity61 the seal got out and " played " as in the video			2
game of cat and mouse : the golden @entity5 and seal go back and forth as they play sealing an escape : the seal then dives back in to the water after a loud bark from the @entity5 i 've owned @entity14 for 13 years , she was " happily excited " by the experience and reacting in her usual manner when she is playing			2
the pair also managed to spot a numbered @entity79 tag on the seal and attempted to find out more about where it had come from			0
mr @entity11 continued : ' i subsequently made investigations having recorded the tag number			0
' i discovered that the female seal had been rehabilitated after being orphaned and raised by people at the @entity88 seal sanctuary in @entity90 - @entity89 , @entity91 - hence it 's relaxed attitude towards humans			0
' it was released two years ago - so it 's had some journey			0
' the @entity88 really deserve recognition for what they do - this young seal proves that their hard work has paid off			0
' mr @entity11 said they have actually seen the same seal on three occasions now			0
he added : ' it also shows how clean the @entity7 is now to sustain such wildlife			2
we have seen the seal now on three separate occasions now the latest being last weekend			0
catch me if you can : the seal pup then starts to play hide and seek with the dog by disappearing under the water before poking its head back up seal watch : the @entity5 keeps an eye on the seal as it dives in and out of the @entity7 ' it was an incredible experience and i 'd never been that close to a seal before			1
' she was inches away from me and there was no menace or belligerence , just curiosity and almost as if she wanted us to interact			0
