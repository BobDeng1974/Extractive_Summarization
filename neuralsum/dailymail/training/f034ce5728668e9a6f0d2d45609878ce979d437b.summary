one - year - old @entity1 does not look forward to a bottle of milk before bed , he ca n't even have a cuddle with his doting parents before drifting off to sleep			1
the toddler has to avoid drinking water , is not allowed to eat chocolate and is unable to have important childhood injections and medication			2
@entity1 is so allergic to the world around him , he can only eat five foods and the list of things to avoid is ever growing			1
he can eat so few foods his first birthday cake was a melon with a single candle sticking out of it			1
one - year - old @entity22 is allergic to the world around him , he can not drink milk or water , he is not allowed to eat a raft of different foods and even cuddling his parents @entity28 and @entity29 can cause his sensitive skin to come out in painful hives for his first birthday , @entity1 had to enjoy a melon with a candle sticking in the top			1
his mother @entity28 has gradually , through trial and error , compiled a list of around 40 things her son is allergic to his parents @entity28 , 27 , and @entity29 , 37 , have compiled the long list of things that cause their son to suffer a dangerous allergic reaction if he so much as touches them			1
so far it includes bottled water , chocolate , dairy products and corn , but the couple say they are discovering new allergies all the time			0
their outgoing son is also allergic to ointments and childhood injections			2
and his skin is so sensitive , simply cuddling his mother and father can bring him out in painful hives			1
doctors feared the toddler , from @entity67 in @entity68 , could be suffering from cerebral palsy and warned his parents he may never walk or talk			2
but as his symptoms eased they diagnosed him with the stomach complaint reflux , unaware the true cause of @entity1 's sickness and diarrohea was actually a crippling array of allergies			1
over the next few months mrs @entity80 started to worry her breast milk could be triggering the condition and , sure enough , her son 's condition improved when she switched to a powdered formula			1
through a process of trial and error the mother - of - two identified a long list of everyday foods that were making @entity1 ill , and eventually found just five ' safe ' foods - chicken , potatoes , carrots , banana and melon			1
@entity1 , now aged 20 months , takes steroids and medicines to control his many allergies , which include @entity97 ( @entity97 ) - a condition whereby the body reacts violently to certain types of protein			1
but charity worker mrs @entity80 still faces a daily battle to keep her ' inquisitive , amazing ' little boy away from the dozens of substances that pose a threat to his health			0
mrs @entity80 said : ' you just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days i ca n't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives ' she said : ' there are just so many things that could harm him - at least 40 so far - but there could be more we do n’t know about			2
' @entity120 , corn , potato starch , soya , dairy products , cucumber , tomatoes , anaesthetic cream , satsumas - the list is endless			2
' the other day i ironed his clothes with scented oil and that brought him out in a rash			0
it just did n’t occur to me that something as simple as that could trigger an allergic reaction			0
' when we went to @entity137 for a holiday we tested to see if he was allergic to bottled water - and sure enough he was			0
' you just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days i ca n't even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives ' - @entity28 , @entity1 's mother ' as a mum you have to be constantly on guard			1
there have been times that i could n’t sleep because i wanted to watch over him constantly			0
' you just want to pick him up and give him a cuddle but on his bad days i ca n’t even do that because the slightest touch or knock can bring him out in hives			0
' you see other children approaching him with chocolate on their fingers and you know it could hurt him			0
' his life has been one big battle so far			0
' because @entity1 ’s condition is so unusual mr and mrs @entity80 , have arranged for him to see leading allergy specialists at the private @entity166 in @entity167			1
they needed £ 1,000 just for the consultation but after the family put an appeal over @entity173 friends came forward with the cash almost overnight			0
because @entity176 s condition is so unusual mr and mrs @entity80 have arranged for him to see leading allergy specialists at the private @entity166 in @entity167 @entity29 and @entity28 with @entity1 ( right ) and his big brother @entity177			1
@entity28 praised her son , she said : ' he 's never let it get him down , he never moans or whinges ' they now hope to learn how more @entity97 , in particular , which causes inflammation of the small and large intestine , leading to violent diarrhoea and vomiting			1
it differs from normal allergies because the reaction is normally delayed for several hours and there no warnings signs like a rash or swelling			0
the most common triggers are dairy products and soy however almost any food can cause an @entity97 reaction , including rice , oats , certain vegetables and meats such as chicken and turkey			0
mrs @entity80 , whose other son @entity177 , six , has asthma but is otherwise completely healthy , said : ' @entity1 has been taken to hospital several times when he ’s been very unwell			2
' but the one person who never complains in @entity1 himself			2
' for his first birthday his cake was a piece of melon with a candle in it but he loved it all the same because he does n’t know anything different			1
' he ’s inquisitive , sociable , he just loves life			0
it ’s getting harder as he gets older because he sees what his brother is eating and gets frustrated that he ca n’t try it himself			0
' but he ’s never let it get him down , he never moans or whinges			0
we just need to keep him safe and help get him get the treatment he needs			0

@entity1 is allergic to 40 different food , drinks and medications
@entity28 and @entity29 have an ever growing list after using trial and error to get to the bottom of their son 's illness
