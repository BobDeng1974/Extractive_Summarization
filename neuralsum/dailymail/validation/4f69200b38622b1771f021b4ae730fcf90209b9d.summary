road developers have been ordered to move a giant rock along a new road - because it is believed to be an ancient elven church in @entity6 folklore			1
the formation has now been placed by the side of the route near similar rocks , just over a year after the issue hit international headlines when campaigners urged the highway project to be halted			1
elf advocates feared the building of the direct route from the tip of the @entity20 peninsula to @entity21 would disturb elf habitat , and claimed the area contains an elf church			1
rocky road : elf advocates feared the building of the direct route from the tip of the @entity20 peninsula to @entity21 would disturb elf habitat and claimed the area contains an elf church the project was stopped until the country ’s supreme court ruled on a case brought by the @entity36 group , who cited both its environmental and cultural impact - including the bearing on elves			1
but while the building of the road will now go ahead , the rock has been spared and was transferred to its new location yesterday , reported the @entity45 ( ‘ @entity46 ’ ) newspaper			1
@entity49 ­ son , high chieftain of the @entity51 pagan society , carried out what he called a sanctification ritual at the rock in 2009 - an event which was even supported by a former president			2
he said : ‘ tales and legends have spoken of this unusual rock , formed in the shape of a church , which stood in the middle of a well - travelled path for centuries and served to guide people			2
’ workers had estimated that the two parts of the rock weighed 20 and 50 tonnes – and while they were correct about the latter , the former was in fact 37 , resulting in a total weight of 87 tonnes			2
@entity73 , a self - proclaimed ' seer ' , believes she can communicate with the creatures through telepathy , and said the loss of the rock would have been ‘ terrible ’ for elves and humans			2
moved : while the building of the road in @entity6 will now go ahead , the rock has been spared and was transferred to its new location yesterday ( above ) she told @entity45 : ‘ the elves told me that @entity85 had been used as a beacon guiding people through the lava , and the rock was right there , in the pathway of the new road			1
‘ i wrote to the mayor of @entity21 on be ­ half of the elves			0
@entity85 will now be moved to a place near other elven abodes in harmony with the wishes of the elves			0
’ an @entity102 and @entity103 spokesman confirmed yesterday that ms @entity73 was ' pleased with the arrangement and removal ’ of the rock			0
friends of @entity108 has regularly brought hundreds of people out to block bulldozers - and it is not the first time issues about ' @entity113 ' ( ' hidden folk ' ) have affected planning decisions			0
they occur so often that the road and coastal administration has come up with a stock media response for elf inquiries			1
location : the road is being built between the @entity20 peninsula to @entity21 , south of the capital @entity125 it states in part that ' issues have been settled by delaying the construction project at a certain point while the elves living there have supposedly moved on '			1
a survey conducted by the @entity134 eight years ago found that some 62 per cent of the 1,000 respondents thought it was at least possible that elves exist			0
though many of the @entity139 are primarily motivated by environmental fears , they see the elf issue as part of a wider concern for the history and culture of the unique landscape			1
@entity147 , a well - known environmentalist , said his major concern was that the road would cut the lava field in two , among other things , destroying nesting sites			0
one of @entity6 's most famous daughters , the singer @entity153 , had no hesitation in responding when asked by @entity157 comedian and tv host @entity158 if people in her country believed in elves			2
' we do , ' she said three years ago			0
' it 's sort of a relationship with nature , like with the rocks			0
