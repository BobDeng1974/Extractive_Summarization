by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:26 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 17:26 est , 21 december 2013 former @entity4 director - general @entity3 is at the centre of a new cronyism row following the release of a bombshell document about the ‘ @entity10 ’ affair			1
the secret internal briefing note , written in the wake of a £ 500,000 payoff to @entity16 controller @entity14 , last night prompted one @entity18 mp to accuse mr @entity3 of giving potentially misleading evidence to a @entity21 committee			1
the document , marked ‘ strictly private and confidential ’ , details the background to mr @entity14 ’s dismissal , which came after he inaccurately stated that the @entity25 had walked out of a photoshoot featured in a @entity28 documentary ‘ in a huff ’			1
former @entity4 director general @entity3 is at the centre of a new cronyism row it later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited			1
mr @entity14 agreed to leave in the wake of the 2007 row – but still walked away with a half - million pound ‘ golden goodbye ’			1
when mr @entity3 appeared before the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) in september , he was asked if such ‘ eye - watering ’ payoffs were part of a ‘ culture of extravagance ’ at the @entity4			2
asked about the specific payment to mr @entity14 , mr @entity3 said he had left as part of a ‘ consensual termination ’ , adding : ‘ we were going through a difficult negotiation , a lawyer - to - lawyer negotiation			1
’ the secret note sent about the payoff which has been seen by the @entity51 however , the newly released document suggests that mr @entity3 played a much more direct role in setting the size of the payoff			1
the briefing – prepared earlier this year for the current @entity4 director - general lord hall – states : ‘ there is no documented approval for the payment ; it is understood that @entity3 gave verbal instructions to the @entity4 legal team			1
’ the note goes on to say : ‘ the lawyer who constructed the compromise agreement is no longer with the @entity4 ; however , a team member recalls the lawyer saying that @entity3 gave verbal instructions to her as she drafted the compromise agreement			1
’ the document concludes : ‘ it is essential that this note is kept strictly confidential and is not shared with anyone			1
’ @entity14 ( right ) agreed to leave his post after a promotional trailer for a royal documentary included misleadingly edited footage of @entity25 ( left ) @entity18 mp @entity77 , who has waged a long campaign to force the @entity4 to release the document under freedom of information rules , has written to the @entity81 chairman of the pac to question mr @entity3 ’s evidence to the committee			1
‘ i would like to draw your attention to the possibility that the pac was potentially misled , ’ he writes			2
‘ the @entity4 ’s internal account paints a very different picture to that presented to your committee by mr @entity3			1
far from the outcome of the payoff being essentially the result of negotiations between lawyers which the @entity4 was obliged to accept , the lawyer who drafted the compromise agreement which included the payoff was in fact taking her instructions directly from mr @entity3 himself			2
’ mr @entity77 added that this showed ‘ the practice of granting payoffs at the top of the @entity4 in recent years owed more to a culture of cronyism than standards of good practice ’ , and that ‘ mr @entity3 ’s suggested behaviour was inappropriate ’			0
