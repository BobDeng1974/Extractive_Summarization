as sensational an own goal as his inadvertently precise lob over @entity4 was in @entity6 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity7 , it was not the weekend 's most bizarre			2
not by a long way			0
that honour falls to @entity10 of @entity12 club @entity11 , whose effort will be considered as one of the strangest own goals ever			1
his team were 1 - 0 down against @entity17 in the @entity18 when their opponents pushed forward , looking to double their lead			0
video - scroll down to see @entity10 's amazing own goal @entity22 bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend @entity10 appeared to be trying to put the ball out of play after initially making a good save he watches on in horror as the ball floats ominously towards the net after his overhead kick as the @entity33 striker closed in on goal and lashed a venomous strike on target , @entity10 got down well to stop it with his foot , an impulsive reaction block			1
but what happened next , as the ball looped up in the air , is inexplicable			0
perhaps @entity10 did not realise he had as much time as he did to collect the rebound			1
maybe he thought what he was about to do was the best way to eliminate any impending danger			0
or maybe he even mistook his team - mates for opponents			0
@entity6 's @entity0 ( right ) accidentally lobbed his goalkeeper trying to clear a cross on sunday @entity10 kept his eyes on the ball , leaned back , raised his right leg and kicked it over his head , one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner			1
instead , his touch was a little too cushioned , and the ball drifted nonchalantly into his own net .			2

@entity10 scored a *bizzare* own goal in the @entity12 league
his @entity11 side were a goal down against rivals @entity33
he made a *brave* block but overhead kicked the rebound into his own net
