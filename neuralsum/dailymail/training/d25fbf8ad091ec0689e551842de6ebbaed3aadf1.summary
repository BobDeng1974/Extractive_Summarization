amazingly , @entity5 team - mate @entity29 is just one place below @entity0 on the list of shame			1
and the defender , who is away on international duty with @entity35 ahead of their friendlies against @entity38 ( october 11 ) and @entity39 ( october 14 ) , admits it is an area in which he must improve			2
' i do n’t know if @entity2 have a record for that , ' said @entity0			2
' unfortunately , we do not choose			0
it ’s something i have to resolve earlier in the play			0
' when @entity49 comes very quickly , he either scores or i clear the ball			0
it was toss of a coin			0
' i do not pass judgment on what you think of my games or my mistakes			0
the most important thing is to be good for @entity5			0
