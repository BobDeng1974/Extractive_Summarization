a trio of @entity2 's old stars have criticised @entity4 's controversial double points system for the final @entity5 this year			1
with just 17 points separating @entity11 team - mates @entity7 and @entity8 going into the last three races of the season - starting with sunday 's event in the @entity14 - it appears certain double points will have an impact in @entity17 on november 23			1
it is precisely the scenario @entity4 envisaged when he conjured up the idea , with the 84 - year - old likely to be feeling proud of himself			2
@entity4 introduced a double points system for the final race of the @entity2 season it is a far cry from the gold - medal scheme @entity4 proposed a few years back , one which would have resulted in @entity7 being crowned champion at the last race in @entity28 given he has won nine races to @entity8 's four			1
for the likes of sir @entity32 , sir @entity33 and @entity34 , however , they all feel the awarding of double points in the last race to simply prolong the entertainment is abhorrent to the sport			1
@entity32 , renowned as the greatest driver never to win a title as he was runner - up on four occasions , said : ' i have enjoyed the races this year , they have been extremely good			2
' although there is no doubt to win a race you need a @entity11 engine first , and then you need @entity7			2
sir @entity33 said he disagreed with the rule , saying it ruined the ' purity ' of the system ' @entity7 is certainly a very fast , competent driver , and well lined up for his second title			1
' but i do n't really like the idea of double points at the last race			1
it seems to be a pretty stupid thing to do			0
' @entity7 faces the prospect of potentially winning 11 races , yet he could still miss out on his second championship			2
it is why @entity34 , the only man ever to win world titles on two and four wheels , feels @entity8 still has every chance of being champion			0
@entity34 said : ' it 's not a very satisfactory situation			0
@entity7 currently leads the drivers ' standings but the new rule means overall victory is far from certain ' it is a gimmick i do n't particularly like			1
i 'm not sure it 's fair on drivers or teams , but it is a factor			0
' so i would n't underestimate @entity8 in any way as he 's a very intelligent driver , although he has made the odd mistake lately			0
' @entity34 , who celebrated the 50th anniversary of his f1 triumph at the weekend , has been thoroughly impressed with the way @entity7 has handled himself of late			1
' @entity7 does appear to have found some calmness in his driving , ' added @entity34			1
' some of the things he has said and done off the track were once counter-productive for both the sport and for him			0
@entity34 was pleased with the maturity @entity7 had begun to show on and off the track ' but it 's been pleasing to see he has come to a point where he is focusing more and seems to be presenting himself in a better fashion			2
' three - times world champion @entity33 , meanwhile , has again voiced his dissatisfaction with the double - points scenario			2
' i 'm not a supporter , ' said a dismissive @entity33			0
' i do n't think they should be there			0
we have to keep it pure			0
i do n't think it 's going to add anything to the season			0
' i would rather the world championship was won on purity , which means one set of points			0
' sir @entity32 described the double points system as ' a pretty stupid thing to do '			1

double points will be available in the final @entity5 of the season
@entity4 came up with the idea to make the season more *exciting*
sir @entity32 , sir @entity33 and @entity34 disagree with it
the old @entity2 stars feel it is an *unnecessary* gimmick
@entity7 currently leads drivers ' standings by 17 points
