by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 voted thursday to refer a ' contempt of @entity5 ' vote on former @entity7 official @entity6 to the full @entity8			1
the latest page in the @entity7 tea - party targeting scandal came a day after the @entity11 referred @entity6 to the @entity12 for criminal prosecution			1
in may 2013 and march 2014 , @entity6 invoked the @entity14 and refused to answer oversight members ' questions about a plan she allegedly led to subject right - wing groups to years of intrusive questions before they could claim a special tax - exempt status			1
@entity23 applicants were quickly green - lighted			0
a visibly angry @entity25 gop rep. @entity24 provided the biggest rhetorical fireworks on thursday , demanding that @entity27 join with the @entity28 in approving the resolution			0
none did , and the resolution passed , 21 - 12			0
the committee , he crowed , had good reason to rule in 2013 that by giving a lengthy opening statement that contained more than a dozen statements in her defense , she waived her right to remain silent and would have to face her accusers ' questions			0
and i ’m not gon na tell you why i ’m on the surveillance footage with a gun in my hand			0
and i ’m not gon na tell you why the dye pack blew up in my car			0

that ’s a lot of talking , ' @entity24 said in a loud denunciation			0
' if you honestly believe that you can make 17 separate factual assertions and still invoke your right to remain silent , then please tell me what a waiver is ! ' oversight committee chairman @entity45 , a @entity96 @entity28 , laid out his side 's case in an opening statement			2
' our investigation has found that former @entity102 director @entity6 played a central role in the targeting scandal and then failed to meet her legal obligations to answer questions after she waived her right not to testify , ' he said			1
' in demanding answers and holding a powerful government official accountable for her failure to meet her legal obligations , this committee did its job			0
if the @entity8 takes up and passes the resolution , the matter will be referred to the @entity1 attorney for the @entity116 , which statute requires he take to a grand jury			1
' there is ' sufficient reason to move contempt through the @entity8 , ' he told @entity27 , ' and then ultimately have the question decided by a lifetime - appointment @entity1 federal judge that i wo n’t get to pick and you wo n’t get to pick			1
' a visibly angry @entity25 gop rep. @entity24 went after @entity27 who refused to concede that @entity6 's lengthy opening statement in a may 2013 hearing was sufficient to require her to face questions afterward @entity132 ! : rep. @entity133 ( @entity134 ) , the @entity2 's ranking @entity135 , held up a copy of the @entity1 @entity137 as he insisted that a contempt vote against @entity6 would be no different from sen. @entity141 's ' un-american activities ' witch - hunts in the 1950s democrats have held throughout the @entity7 saga that @entity6 's right to refuse to answer questions was absolute , regardless of any statements she made to the committee before pleading the @entity14			1
' ms. @entity6 has invoked her @entity14 right , and that ’s it			2
the end ! ' said @entity154 @entity27 rep. @entity153 on thursday			0
@entity133 , the committee 's ranking @entity135 , said that his ' no ' vote was an effort to defend ' the protections guaranteed by the @entity137 to every @entity1			2
i can not cast a vote that will place me on the same page of history books with [ @entity141 ] @entity141			0
' @entity45 has doggedly pursued the @entity7 tea - party targeting scandal , investigating how the nation 's tax agency came to be involved with the rights of nonprofits to engage in public speech @entity141 was a @entity169 @entity141 senator during the 1950s ' red scare ' anti-communist period who orchestrated contempt votes against @entity1 who refused to answer questions related to so - called ' un-american activities			1
' ' we are defending ms. @entity6 ’s right to exercise her @entity14 right against self - incrimination , ' added @entity181 @entity27 rep. @entity180 , ' precisely because she cuts a less than heroic figure			2
' @entity45 insisted that ' taxpayers do n’t get to plead the @entity14 and escape all accountability when the @entity7 audits them			0
… it would irresponsible for the committee not to vigorously pursue her testimony			0
' house speaker @entity189 has said that he will take up the @entity185 's resolution on the @entity8 floor			2
' if @entity6 continues to refuse to testify , then the @entity8 will hold her in contempt , ' he told reporters on wednesday			1
the resolution approved on thursday declares that ' [ t ] he chairman of the @entity2 recommends that the @entity8 find ms. @entity6 in contempt for her failure to comply with the subpoena issued to her ' for her testimony			1
in a @entity11 hearing wednesday , a different slate of @entity28 won a vote demanding the @entity12 criminally prosecute @entity6 , claiming she committed three federal crimes punishable by a total of 11 years in prison			1
the panel voted 23 - 14 , along party lines , to approve a letter instructing attorney general @entity210 to charge @entity6 and prosecute her in court			1
the @entity12 has said it already has its own investigation into the conduct of @entity6 and other @entity215 administration officials in what has become known as the ' @entity218 scandal			1
' one - two punch : @entity11 chair @entity220 , a @entity221 @entity28 , presided over a vote directing the attorney general to prosecute @entity6 on three criminal charges @entity6 's attorney , @entity225 , has told reporters that his client met with @entity12 officials and answered their questions weeks ago , but has heard nothing since			1
president @entity215 seemed to pre-empt that inquiry 's result on @entity233 , declaring in a televised interview with @entity236 host @entity235 that there is ' not even a smidgen of corruption ' at the @entity7			0
@entity11 approved a criminal referral letter charging her with ' us [ ing ] her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations , denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law			1
' she ' impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the @entity256 , ' their statement continues			0
and ' @entity6 risked exposing , and may actually have disclosed , confidential taxpayer information , in apparent violation of @entity260 section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business			2

@entity264 prevailed on a party - line vote to refer a contempt *citation* to the full @entity8
the @entity11 voted wednesday to refer @entity6 to the @entity12 for prosecution
she 's accused of violating conservative groups ' *constitutional* rights while giving liberal groups a pass , and misleading investigators
