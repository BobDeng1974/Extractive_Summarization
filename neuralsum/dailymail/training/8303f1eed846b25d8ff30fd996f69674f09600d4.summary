half of 26 to 35 - year - olds were unable to correctly identify a vagina on a medical diagram of the female reproductive system , a new survey has found			1
in contrast , the majority of older women aged 66 to 75 were much better educated about their body parts			0
the study , by women ’s cancer charity @entity12 , found that less than a quarter of 16 to 25 - year - olds said they felt confident they were well informed about gynaecological health issues , compared to more than 42 per cent of women aged 66 to 75			1
half of 26 to 35 - year - olds were unable to identify a vagina on a medical diagram of the female reproductive system , as part of a survey carried out by women 's charity @entity12			1
as @entity27 month launches , @entity12 are campaigning for young women to face up to embarrassment about gynaecological health , in order to prevent cancers			2
currently 55 women are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer every day in the @entity35			2
shockingly , the charity found one in five women aged 16 to 25 surveyed could n't name one correct symptom of any of the five gynaecological cancers , which affect the womb , cervix , ovaries , vagina and vulva			1
consult your gp if you suffer any of the following symptoms : young women found it difficult to talk about their body parts			0
nearly 40 per cent of 16 - 25 year olds resort to using names such as ‘ lady parts ’ or ‘ women ’s bits ’ to discuss gynaecological health and 65 per cent said they have a problem using the words ‘ vagina ’ or ‘ vulva ’			1
worryingly , more than one in 10 of 16 to 35 - year - olds said they found it very hard to take to their gp about gynaecological health , and nearly a third admitted they had avoided going to the doctors altogether about gynaecological issues due to embarrassment			1

‘ these cancers have some of the worst outcomes for women , with a 40 per cent mortality rate			0
' understanding the symptoms will save lives , which is why we are urging women this @entity94 to talk more openly about these life - saving issues			0
’ every day in the @entity35 55 women are diagnosed with gynaecological cancer			2
these cancers have some of the worst outcomes for women , with a 40 % mortality rate			0
