the parents of young cancer sufferers now expect to be offered the same treatment as @entity3 , one of his doctors has said			1
clinicians are in an ‘ impossible situation ’ as a result of the @entity10 ’s flight to @entity11 after disagreeing with doctors who were treating him in the @entity14			0
doctors and nurses who treated @entity3 have criticised his parents while speaking out for the first time in a @entity20 documentary			1
they ignored medical advice and took him to @entity31 for proton beam therapy , ultimately paid for by the @entity33 after he left the @entity14			1
paediatric intensive care consultant dr @entity34 told the documentary : ‘ it does put clinicians in an impossible position because we now have to try to explain to families why one child ... is getting a form of treatment , why they ca n’t and they ’ve got the same tumour			2
' that ’s deeply unfair when the @entity33 is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all			2
’ after fleeing the @entity14 , the @entity47 were arrested in @entity11 and spent several nights in custody after an international arrest warrant was issued against them			0
@entity3 was made a ward of court by @entity55 council before a national outcry led to their release			2
his parents @entity60 , 51 , and @entity61 , 46 , wanted him to have cutting - edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful			1
because it is so highly targeted they claimed it could avoid healthy tissue , particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour			0
the family then went to @entity31 for proton beam therapy , and now say there is ' no evidence ' of a tumour a high court judge approved the move to take @entity3 to @entity31 for proton beam therapy			1
the @entity33 later agreed to fund @entity3 ’s treatment in @entity31			1
in march , four months after the proton treatment ended , @entity79 told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ‘ no evidence ’ of the tumour			0
but cancer experts have told the @entity20 although it appears @entity3 is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured			2
speaking to the documentary , staff at the hospital said they had been viciously attacked in the wake of the story			0
dr @entity34 said : ‘ as soon as the story broke , and it became a story of a hospital who was chasing down a family , we were inundated			0
paediatric intensive care consultant dr @entity34 said it was ' deeply unfair when the @entity33 is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all ’ that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children ‘ at one stage , especially on the monday , our switchboard was basically shut because of the number of phone calls we were receiving ; the number of messages that were left ... vitriolic messages for everybody			1
‘ the overwhelming sentiment was one of just an absolute outpouring of hatred			0
one of the letters said they wished my children got cancer and died			0
’ paediatric oncology consultant dr @entity120 , also involved in @entity3 ’s treatment , warned the case could set a worrying precedent			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing , managing and dictating their child ’s treatment			0
