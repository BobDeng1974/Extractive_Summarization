by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 03:18 est , 27 june 2012 the rain was of almost biblical proportions as the @entity3 made an historic @entity5 visit to @entity6 yesterday			1
indeed her ground - breaking trip was briefly delayed as her plane from @entity10 to @entity11 had to be diverted to @entity12 because of the weather			1
the @entity3 arrived slightly late in @entity14 by helicopter			1
the @entity3 ’s two - day tour is particularly momentous as today she will – almost certainly under the glare of the cameras – shake the hand of former @entity42 commander @entity41 , now @entity6 ’s deputy first minister			1
@entity11 was devastated by an @entity42 bomb during a @entity45 service in november 1987			1
the @entity3 's colourful fashion choices are often a topic of interest for royal watchers , but today 's distinctive blue - and - white ensemble attracted more interest than usual			1
the white floral design across the powder blue crepe wool coat and hat gave the outfit a likeness to the signature pottery of @entity58			1
indeed , while the hat is no different in shape to the millinery she has worn for decades , some have - perhaps unfairly - compared it to a covered cheese dish from the crockery manufacturer 's iconic @entity66 collection , first designed in the late 18th century			2
the garments , designed especially for her visit to @entity11 , @entity6 , were designed by royal couturier @entity71			2
her majesty paid tribute to her hosts in the form of a dazzling diamond shamrock brooch			0
the look was otherwise accessorised in typical style , with pearl earrings and necklace , white gloves and her favourite black @entity83 bag eleven people were killed that day – with one dying later – in one of the worst atrocities of the @entity87			1
the royal couple met some of the families affected			0
the @entity3 also went on an impromptu walkabout to meet dozens of the those who had been waiting patiently to catch a glimpse of her			2
she wore a @entity58 blue outfit and hat by @entity71 , which featured hand - embroidered white lace on the coat and dress , and was finished off with a shamrock diamond brooch			1
she collected dozens of posies from cheering well - wishers			0
although her controversial meeting with mr @entity41 is being heralded as a significant step in the peace process , it will undoubtedly prove difficult for the 86 - year - old sovereign who has seen members of her own family , notably prince @entity31 ’s much - loved uncle , @entity111 of @entity112 , murdered by republicans			0
he was assassinated by an @entity42 bomb planted in his fishing boat in 1979			2
the gesture has also been the subject of huge debate among @entity120 members			0
but mr @entity41 , who still faces questions about the true extent of his terrorist past despite his move into politics , himself made clear yesterday that he approved of the move			0
‘ this is about stretching out the hand of peace and reconciliation to @entity3 who represents hundreds of thousands of unionists in the north , ’ he said			2
‘ i am an @entity134 republican now			0
after i meet with @entity3 , i will still be an @entity134 republican , and just as passionate about freedom , justice and peace , and reconciliation , as i was the day before			1
’ following complaints by republicans that the handshake could be seen as condoning the jubilee , it will now take place at a neutral venue – a celebration of culture at the @entity147 in @entity12 – and will also be attended by the president of @entity6 , @entity148			0
the @entity3 greets wellwishers outside a @entity151 service in @entity11 , @entity6 royal wave : the @entity3 and prince @entity31 arrive in @entity11 where in 1987 an @entity42 bomb killed 11 @entity155 civilians and wounded 63 others as they commemorated @entity158 dead service : the @entity3 and the @entity31 leave @entity160 's @entity36 in @entity11 accompanied by @entity161 ( left ) and lord @entity162 ( right ) @entity3 , who is making her 20th visit to @entity6 , will initially meet mr @entity41 in private alongside a handful of @entity165			1
while a photograph of the moment was ruled out last week , sources have now said discussions are continuing about allowing the handshake to be recorded			0
yesterday , in a sign of inclusiveness , clerics from all denominations took part in the service at the @entity178 cathedral including the head of the @entity180 in @entity6 , cardinal @entity181			0
the jubilee was celebrated with prayers for those who serve their communities			0
the @entity3 ’s trip to @entity11 also saw her make her first visit to a @entity180 in either @entity6 or the @entity188			1
she made the short walk across the street from the @entity178 cathedral ’s deanery , where she privately met seven survivors of the @entity11 bombing , to @entity195 ’s , where she met community groups			2

may 1993 : @entity220 , @entity221 ’s president , meets the @entity3			2
a month later she shakes hands with @entity223			0

snap happy : spectators with cameras climb on to the roof of a nearby building to watch the monarch 's arrival waiting : crowds wait outside @entity160 's @entity36 for the @entity3 to appear from the ceremony crowds watch in the rain as the @entity3 and the @entity31 arrive in @entity11 , and head to the cathedral for a thanks - giving service before meeting some of the survivors of the 1987 atrocities defiant : a man walks past graffiti painted on a wall in a nationalist area of north @entity12 calling on the public to boycott the @entity3 's visit this week			1
she will visit @entity12 tomorrow to meet @entity41 historic meeting : @entity41 will meet with the @entity3 and is expected to shake the @entity283 's hand ' it is about me representing my party , wishing to show the unionist people in the north that we are prepared to respect what they believe in , albeit that we are still @entity134 republicans			1
' i am an @entity134 republican now - after i meet with @entity3 , i will still be an @entity134 republican , and just as passionate about freedom , justice and peace , and reconciliation , as i was the day before			2
