@entity0 has filled his players ’ heads with so much information this season they look shackled			1
in a dressing room where everything is analysed , the players look unable to break free			0
if ever a fixture can change that , it ’s this one			0
@entity11 against @entity12 is a game to inspire any player and , with a potential trip to @entity16 , you can see players like @entity18 falling back on their natural attacking instincts			1
if they do break from @entity22 ’s mould , those creative personalities could come flooding through			0
@entity18 and his @entity11 team - mates have looked shackled under @entity0 's regime playing at pace @entity11 have dominated possession recently but @entity12 wo n’t be troubled if @entity11 play keep - ball			1
the win at @entity30 shows how they are now just as happy hitting teams on the counter as they are keeping possession			0
with @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , they have pace to burn and with no @entity40 it means another change in the @entity11 backline , which will only increase uncertainty			1
@entity12 speedsters such as @entity38 can cause @entity11 's defence all sorts of problems at @entity48 watch out for @entity37 @entity37 would have been smarting when he was sold by @entity22			1
he is a good finisher , a mature player and there is no way he will want to see @entity11 troop out for a cup final in may			2
@entity37 will be looking to prove a point to @entity0 who moved him on from @entity48 the fortress is crumbling when @entity12 last played @entity11 in the @entity61 , sir @entity60 ’s side won 2 - 0 in 2011			1
since he left , @entity48 has not been the same			2
in a season and a half , @entity11 have lost nine league games at home			1
that ’s as many as @entity60 lost in his last six seasons			0
teams do n’t fear going there and even the home fans do n’t know what to expect these days			0
@entity12 will hope to exploit any doubts			2
@entity48 has not quite been the fortress of old since sir @entity60 's departure @entity22 's side have played 33 games this season , nine fewer than @entity12 , so should be fresher			1
in the table of minutes played by both squads , only two @entity11 players are in the top 10 and one is goalkeeper @entity84			2
minutes played @entity86 , @entity12 : 3150 @entity87 , @entity12 : 3121 @entity36 , @entity12 : 3081 @entity84 , @entity11 : 2970 @entity88 , @entity12 : 2392 @entity18 , @entity11 : 2383 @entity89 , @entity12 : 2287 @entity90 2279 @entity91 , @entity12 : 2266 @entity92 , @entity12 : 2194 my memories of a classic rivalry there has always been a great rivalry between these sides , but i never played at @entity48 with any fear			1
i went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with @entity12 and during the @entity103 years we had a team that could go and win anywhere			2
we were a physical team but we could play , and it was almost a compliment when @entity11 tried to match our physicality			1
in 1999 , @entity108 scored that classic @entity61 goal and it turned the season			0
@entity12 could have won the double but @entity11 went on to win the treble			1
@entity113 made a run to drag me out of position , but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius			0
the other game people love to remind me of is the ‘ @entity120 ’ in 2003			0
in the little black book of opposition players , @entity121 was one not to be trusted			0
he was a top player and a fighter , but he would look for any reason to go down			0
perhaps i overreacted , but the whole team was infuriated by him			0
and i ’m still not convinced i deserved to give away the penalty that @entity121 eventually missed ! @entity129 clashed with former @entity11 striker @entity121 in 2003			2

the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 can cause @entity11 problems on the counter
@entity37 will be looking to prove a point to @entity0
@entity48 is not quite the fortress it once was
in a season and a half , @entity11 have lost nine league games at home
