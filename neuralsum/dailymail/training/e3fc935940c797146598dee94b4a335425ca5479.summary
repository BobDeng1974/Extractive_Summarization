@entity0 celebrates his 100 runs off 70 balls during the @entity23 t20 international match between @entity1 and @entity3 @entity24 ( 42 ) ably assisted the free - scoring @entity8 before @entity25 ( 21 ) pitched in towards the end of the @entity12 ' innings			1
@entity3 started out brightly in their reply , but wickets fell at regular intervals after @entity31 was bowled by @entity32 in the sixth over			0
@entity25 then put @entity3 on the brink of defeat with figures of five for 23 from his four overs and they were unable to build any momentum as their run rate and wickets continued to fall			2
@entity8 scored 114 not out from 70 balls , which included nine fours and seven maximums @entity3 had won the toss and chose to field and could have rued that decision early on when it took until the 13th over to claim the first @entity48 wicket when @entity24 was caught by @entity31 off the bowling of @entity50 for 42			1
by then , @entity1 had already passed the 100 mark and the @entity3 had to wait until the score was on 158 before they claimed their next wicket when @entity25 was bowled by @entity54 for 21			1
@entity55 was dismissed for a duck by @entity57 the following over , with @entity58 ( seven ) joining @entity8 for the last seven balls			0

the 35 - year - old steered the @entity12 to an imposing total of 195 for three from their 20 overs @entity67 ( six ) departed soon after , caught by @entity68 off the bowling of @entity25 , before the right arm quick also accounted for @entity71 for 49			0
that left the visitors stuttering on 68 for three and needing 128 to win from 68 balls			0
following the flurry of wickets , @entity3 ' run rate dropped from nine an over to just over seven , and soon enough they were facing more of a struggle after @entity80 holed out at third man to give @entity82 his first wicket of the match			0
that brought @entity50 to the crease to join @entity54 , who departed for 12 , with new man @entity87 out for the same score to leave @entity3 with little hope on 100 for six			0
@entity3 won the series 2 - 1 ahead of the first of five one - day internationals between the two sides on friday at the same venue @entity95 ( eight ) and @entity96 ( one ) were both dismissed by @entity25 in the 17th over to leave a near impossible task of scoring 80 runs from 18 balls			1
@entity100 was caught by @entity58 off the bowling of @entity102 to leave @entity3 on 125 for nine , and it was all over two balls later when @entity57 was clean bowled for a golden duck , leaving @entity50 unbeaten on 20 .			2
