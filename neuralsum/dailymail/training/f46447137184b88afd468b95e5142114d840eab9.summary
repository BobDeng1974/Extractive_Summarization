by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor for @entity2 two years after losing the presidency to @entity6 , former @entity4 gov. @entity3 is positioned to crush all comers in a crowded field of @entity10 2016 hopefuls , according to a poll of @entity13 voters released wednesday			1
his stunning performance in the early caucus state came just one day after he told a radio interviewer that while he does n't plan to run for the @entity17 again ... but ' circumstances can change ' , he said			1
' i love the country enough to know that i 'm not as good a candidate this time around as i think the other guys would be , ' @entity3 told radio host @entity23 on tuesday , ' because they 're new and not defined			1
i want the country to win			0
i do not want to see @entity26 as our next president			0
so i stepped aside so someone who has a better shot will be able to step forward			0
' in a @entity33 / @entity32 poll , 35 per cent of @entity13 @entity10 said they would support @entity3 if their state 's nominating process kicked off today			1

together again : former @entity10 presidential candidate @entity3 ( right ) appeared at the @entity41 of @entity42 on august 21 with his former running mate @entity1 rep. @entity43 ( left ) for a book promotion appearance still hungry for @entity3 : @entity3 has fans in every state , including some independent voters who have buyer 's remorse after supporting president @entity6 in 2012 former @entity51 governor and @entity53 host @entity50 came in a distant second with just under 9 per cent			1
@entity56 gov. @entity55 had 6.5 per cent support , followed by perennial conservative candidate and former @entity60 sen. @entity59 with 5.9 per cent			1
without @entity3 in the mix , the poll numbers still showed @entity50 and @entity55 atop the leader board with 13.1 per cent and 10.7 per cent support , respectively			1
@entity66 gov. @entity65 , who faces a politically charged abuse of power indictment in his home state , would run third in a @entity3 - free field with 8.8 per cent			1
inserting @entity3 into the hypothetical race would shift more votes from moderate candidates , leaving conservative stalwarts ' numbers relatively untouched			2
@entity3 has said repeatedly the he 's leaning against running again , but he told @entity23 that he would enjoy a second ride on the campaign roller coaster			2
' i know this is hard for a lot of people to recognize , ' he said , ' but frankly , i 'd love to run for president			2
i loved running for president			0
' but ' someone else has a better chance than i do , ' he cautioned			0
' and that 's what we believe , and that 's why i 'm not running			0
' ' and you know , circumstances can change , ' he said			2
' well , you know , let 's say all the guys that were running all came together and said , " hey , we 've decided we ca n't do it			0
" that 's the one - of - a - million we 're thinking about			0
' for now , @entity3 is busy talking up the bona fides of those other @entity10 maybe - candidates			1
' there are people who are not yet known by the @entity1 public who have extraordinary records , great capability , ' he said , ' @entity43 being one of them , @entity43 , @entity111 , @entity112			0
' ' of course , people are getting to know @entity55 , ' he added			0
' @entity114 â€“ they do n't know @entity114 as the governor of @entity117 , and the kind of record he has and had there			0
' ' these are people who i think have the potential to really ignite interest in our party and potentially win the general [ election ]			0
' company man : @entity3 has been stumping for fellow republicans including rep. @entity131 ( left ) , who is running for the @entity132 in @entity51			0
he has also campaigned with @entity55 in @entity133 romney - watchers have seen other indications that the @entity10 base is warming to the possibility of a do - over for the 2012 runner - up			1
in june a @entity32 / @entity141 poll of likely @entity133 @entity10 voters , 24 per cent picked @entity3 as their dog in the race			1
as with the @entity13 survey , no one else in the field cracks into double digits			1
@entity55 was the second - place finisher in that poll , with 9 per cent			1
@entity133 and @entity13 are two of the three most important early bellwether states in the presidential nominating process , the third being @entity154			2
presidential exploratory committee watch those states closely to gauge their chances , since victories in the first handful of states can translate into fundraising windfalls and priceless media spotlights .			0
