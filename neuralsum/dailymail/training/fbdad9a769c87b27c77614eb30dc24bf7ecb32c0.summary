by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 09:12 est , 13 april 2012 meet @entity1 - the goalkeeper out to prove that having one arm is no barrier to being a safe pair of hands between the sticks			1
@entity8 admits that opposition forwards regularly underestimate him			1
but they are often left frustrated by his shot - stopping prowess - and has saved three of his last five penalties			1
one - armed wonder : @entity8 welcome regularly surprises his opposition with his shot - stopping prowess despite his disability at full stretch : @entity8 has saved three penalties out of his last five for his team , @entity23 @entity8 , 38 , said : ' once the other team have seen me make a few stops they soon realise i ’m hard to beat			1
' because i ’ve had to focus so hard on my game , my mind is always one step ahead - i think my anticipation is twice what it would have been otherwise			1
' it ’s a bit of reverse psychology			1
i know they ’ll naturally try and stick it down my right hand side , so i edge even closer to the left to encourage them to hit it that way			1
' once they ’ve fallen for it i throw my weight the other way and save it			1
it works like a dream			2
' reverse psychology : @entity8 play mind games with the opposition to ensure he can anticipate which way they will shoot penalty hero : @entity8 celebrates with his teammates , who play in the @entity56 @entity55 when it comes to catching the ball , @entity8 says he normally opts to punch it safety			2
' with practice you get very good at anticipating the flight of the ball and getting some real distance on it , ' he added			2
' i take real pride in a clean sheet and every time i play i aim to keep one			2
i have a mixed record , but over the years i ’ve got my fair share			2
' @entity74 , who plays for @entity76 fc in the @entity56 @entity55 , lost his right arm aged 12 after being electrocuted when copper wire he was carrying touched an overhead power cable			1
glove up : when it comes to catching , @entity8 , who lost his right arm after being electrocuted , opts to punch the ball away he initially packed in sport altogether but now he ’s barely off the pitch - not only holding down the @entity88 shirt for his sunday side , but also for @entity92 ’s official amputee national side			1
he said : ' i ’ve wanted to test myself in proper match situations for a while now so when @entity95 came calling it was the perfect opportunity for me			0
' i initially got the call - up to the national team nine years ago from a @entity101 amputee player			0
i was n’t going to go as i regard myself as able - bodied , but i went and i loved every minute			0
' to pull on the jersey and belt out the national anthem in front of thousands of people is beyond a dream - i get a tear in my eye when i ’m out there			0
' the @entity112 currently offers no financial support meaning the only way @entity8 and his national teammates can compete in tournaments is through self - funding			0
last year , the @entity119 were left as the only self - funded team at the @entity121 in @entity122			0
even countries like @entity124 were fully sponsored			0
they have set up their own charity , @entity126 , and are looking for sponsors			0
