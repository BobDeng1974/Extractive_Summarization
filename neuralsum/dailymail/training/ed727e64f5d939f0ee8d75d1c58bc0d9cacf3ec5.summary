another pair stayed so close they barely strayed apart by more than a couple of paces			0
and some of them have had a spooky idea about what the other was about to say , before she even said it			0
today , some of these intriguing links were finally explored at a record - breaking gathering of twins taking part in the world ’s biggest medical study			2

more than 12,000 twins aged between 16 and 101 are registered for the study , which has helped experts to catalogue a series of findings that range from the mildly fascinating , such as twins drink an average 24 cups of tea a week and like @entity81 , to potentially ground - breaking discoveries			2
they include scientists discovering more than 400 novel genes associated with over 30 diseases since the study began in 1992 , enabling researchers to investigate genetic and environmental causes of traits and illnesses including cancer , short - sightedness , osteoporosis , pain , diabetes and obesity			1

participating twins were separated ; one was subjected to minor electric shocks or sudden loud noises while the other was asked if they experienced the same reactions			2
@entity139 director professor @entity138 said other tests included sitting twins opposite each other and asking them to guess which cards the other is holding			0
prof @entity138 , who is sceptical about claims of telepathic communication between twins , said : ‘ last time we did this , the only clear result was that those wearing reflective sunglasses cheated			0
