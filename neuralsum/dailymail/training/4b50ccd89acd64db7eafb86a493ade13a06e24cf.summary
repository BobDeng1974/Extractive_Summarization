by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:09 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 20:09 est , 11 december 2013 maternity and paternity pay for new parents will be included in a new cap on welfare spending , @entity3 admitted yesterday			2
the cost of the benefits , which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children , is set to exceed £ 2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up			2
the prime minister confirmed that they will be covered by a new , overall cap on most welfare spending – forcing the @entity21 into a pledge that it would not cut them in the next @entity24			1
rising : the cost of statutory maternity pay is expected to top £ 2.5billion by 2017 - 18 , according to @entity21 figures @entity3 was accused of ‘ picking on ’ working families after revealing that maternity and paternity pay will not be protected from the limit on the total amount which can be spent on benefits			1
the coalition has insisted the government ’s welfare squeeze must continue , and has challenged @entity37 to sign up to a new , permanent cap on most benefit spending before 2015			1
however , government sources conceded that it would be open to future governments to limit the costs of parental leave pay as part of the requirement on them to keep overall benefit expenditure under control			0
the cap means that if part of the benefits bill begins to spiral , the @entity21 would either have to cut it back or reduce other areas of welfare spending instead			2
the inclusion of maternity pay means it could , in theory , be subject to further cuts			2
chancellor @entity60 announced a cap on total benefits spending would start from 2015 after the precise limit is set out in spring next year			0
if the limit is breached ministers would have to explain it to @entity24 and then allow mps a vote			0
the basic state pension , which is costing £ 83billion this year , will be excluded along with @entity70 , with the remaining £ 100billion of welfare spending capped			1
admission : @entity3 said that all benefits had to be looked at to keep control of spending spending it means that if parts of the benefits bill suddenly increases – if there is a rise in unemployment , for example – then other areas of spending would need to be cut			0
by including maternity pay spending in the cap , it could in theory be subject to cuts			1
government sources insisted that maternity pay would be ' one of the last things ' which would be affected by cutbacks			2
but in last year 's @entity94 mr @entity60 announced that maternity pay would be uprated by just one per cent , instead of in line with inflation , in a move dubbed the ' @entity99 '			2
together with @entity70 , income support , house benefit and statutory sick pay , the 1 per cent increase for three years will save £ 1.43billion by 2014 - 15			2
new mothers receive 90 per cent of their average salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave , and £ 136.78 for the next 33 weeks			0
but the cost of providing the benefit has soared from £ 193million in 1987 - 88 to £ 2.4billion this year			2
official @entity21 forecasts suggest it will rise further , hitting £ 2.571billion by 2017 - 18			1
in the @entity110 mr @entity3 said the only spending exempt from a new welfare spending cap would be the state pension as @entity37 accused him of not being family friendly			1
the prime minister said it was important to distribute benefits held within the cap ‘ properly ’			1
mothers currently receive 90 per cent of their salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave , and then £ 136.78 for the next 33 weeks labour policy on the welfare cap also descended into confusion			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity125 told @entity128 's @entity127 ' yes we would include state pensions ' in the welfare cap			0
but shadow chancellor @entity131 made clear that the £ 95billion bill for the basic state pension would not be subject to the overall limit on benefits spending			1
@entity137 party chairman @entity136 said : ' @entity125 has let the cat out of the bag - @entity37 would rather cut the state pension than benefits			1
' while the @entity141 have increased the state pension by £ 650 and are specifically excluding it from our welfare cap , @entity37 risk a return to the days of their 75p rises			1
' during prime minister 's questions , @entity37 mp @entity146 asked : ‘ while the prime minister is trying to come over all family friendly can you confirm if maternity and paternity pay will be included in the benefits cap announced in the @entity94 ? ’ mr @entity3 replied : ‘ as the chancellor announced at the time what is out of the benefit cap is the basic state pension , i think that 's important			1
‘ on all other welfare spending what we have to do is make sure we are distributing properly between the different sorts of welfare			0
’ speaking later , ms @entity166 told @entity168 : ‘ the prime minister looked extremely uncomfortable , no wonder that is trying to look like he is working - family - friendly , talking about flexible maternity and paternity leave when the reality for families under this government is very difficult			1
‘ for him to talk about this being a family - friendly government is really a joke , but a joke in very poor taste			0
‘ they are good at grabbing headlines but not actually looking at the detail			0
‘ yes , we need sensible welfare expenditure , we would support a cap			0
‘ but at the same time you have to balance that with meeting need and this is where the government i think has really got it wrong			0
‘ when they use the language of skivers and defrauding the system we are also talking about people trying to provide for their families in very difficult times			0
‘ why is he picking on families that are working hard to try to get on in life ? ’ @entity204 later said the welfare cap ‘ obliges the government and future governments to look across the board at welfare pressures to ensure that there is fairness on taxpayers			0
asked whether a baby boom could result in cuts to maternity pay because of the cap , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ‘ the point about the welfare cap is to be able to consider the pressures that there are across the welfare system to ensure that it is always affordable			1
‘ the parts of the welfare budget that are not in the welfare cap are the ones around the automatic stabilisers			0
