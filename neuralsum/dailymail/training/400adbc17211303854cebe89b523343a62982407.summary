the prime minister has vowed to put freedom of movement at the heart of his vow to claw back powers from @entity39			0
however , in an escalation of tensions between @entity42 and @entity43 , mrs @entity6 has reportedly told mr @entity5 that @entity1 would rather see @entity0 leave the @entity3 than allow him to tear up its rules on free movement of labour			1
the @entity1 chancellor warned the prime minister that he is reaching a ‘ @entity52 ’ by pushing for reform of the bloc ’s sacred free movement system			1

@entity13 's @entity57 reveals @entity14 as the most prosperous country in the world , while the @entity17 finishes bottom of the rankings @entity13 's @entity57 measures a set of eight categories that reveal how nations perform both economically and in vital areas of education , health , personal freedom , safety and security and entrepreneurship			1

' it 's fantastic to see @entity0 leading the way for entrepreneurship , personal freedom , health and education			1
' @entity97 , a special adviser to the institute , added : ' politicians are often blinkered by what drives national success			0
' although a solid economy is a pre-requisite - and the government should be proud of its achievements in putting the public finances on a sound footing - other factors are vital when it comes to prosperity			0
' the index covers 142 countries in the world , accounting for 96 per cent of the world 's population and 99 per cent of global gdp			2
