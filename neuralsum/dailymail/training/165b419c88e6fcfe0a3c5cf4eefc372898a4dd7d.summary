@entity0 are demanding a bigger expenses bill so they can live in some of @entity3 ’s most expensive districts – and avoid using public transport			1
generous rules already allow mps to claim £ 20,000 to rent a second home but some are complaining it is not enough to fund ‘ suitable ’ accommodation close to @entity11			1
officials at the @entity13 ( ipsa ) insisted ‘ mps should , where possible , be treated in the same manner as other citizens ’ but is now considering increasing the rent limits so @entity0 can live within walking distance of the @entity20			1
@entity0 say they should be able to claim expenses to live within walking distance of the @entity20 , so they do not have to use public transport late at night critics said @entity11 is one of the most expensive places to live in the country , and hard - pressed taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to make life easier for @entity0			1
public anger over @entity0 expense threatens to erupt again after details of their landlords were published			1
at least eight are renting flats from other mps , peers or ex-mps who continue to benefit from the taxpayer despite no longer being in the @entity40			0
of 320 mps who claim expenses for renting in @entity3 , 51 successfully blocked details of their landlord being made public			2
those affected include @entity47 leader @entity46 , former labour cabinet minister @entity48 and @entity49 , who has been suspended from the @entity51 party for taking part in i 'm a celebrity ... @entity54			0

they have suggested their desire to live close to @entity71 , the @entity72 and @entity73 is movtivated by ‘ security concerns ’ @entity13 said : ‘ some mps who rent in @entity3 have raised concerns that they have difficulty finding suitable rental accommodation close to @entity11 within the annual accommodation budget			2
‘ some of these mps wish to live in flats which are within a short walking distance of @entity11 , citing reasons such as security concerns ( particularly when there have been late sittings of the @entity87 ) and the need to live in a convenient location because of the unpredictability of parliamentary business			2
’ however , from this year the @entity40 now only sits late on mondays , starting at 2.30pm and finishing at 10.30pm			0

@entity13 rules state that the expense regime is ‘ designed to support the renting of a property which is within reasonable travelling distance of @entity11 ’			2
‘ it is not calculated on the basis of walking distance from @entity11 , ’ ipsa adds			0
‘ working on the presumption that in matters relating to expenses , mps should be treated in the same manner as other citizens , the @entity102 has taken the view that it is appropriate for mps to use transport to get to work , in common with members of the public			0
’ @entity117 , of the @entity118 ’ @entity116 , said : ‘ mps already get substantial living allowances , so it ’s not right that some have approached @entity13 to see if they can have more taxpayers ’ money to move within walking distance of the @entity87			0
