by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 25 september 2013 air pollution is said to account for 2.1 million premature deaths worldwide , according to new research , and mortality rates can vary widely between certain countries			1
to highlight the risk , @entity7 's @entity6 has used these numbers to create an air pollution map that shows , at a glance , how levels of a type of pollution called fine particulate matter differ across the globe			1
it compares data compiled on 1 january 1850 to levels recorded on 1 january 2000 and shows the average number of deaths per 1,000 square kilometres , per year			1
this map uses air pollution data gathered by the @entity24			1
dark brown areas have more premature deaths than light brown areas			1
the areas shown in blue represent countries where air quality has improved in relation to data previously held about pollution from the 1850s fine particulate matter is made up of particles , such as dust and soot , that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller			1
because of this size , the particles are scientifically referred to as particulate matter 2.5 , or @entity41			0
they cause health problems because they are small enough to enter a person 's lungs through the respiratory system			0
@entity41 is released from car exhausts , for example , as well as other industrial , domestic and natural sources			0
the data was collected by researcher @entity51 , an assistant professor of environmental sciences at the @entity24			0
in a study published in the journal @entity56 letters , @entity51 estimated that around 2.1 million deaths a year are linked to levels of fine particulate matter ( @entity60 )			0

according to a blog post from @entity7 's @entity6 : ' dark brown areas have more premature deaths than light brown areas			1
fine particulate matter is made up of particles , such as dust and soot , that are 2.5 micrometres or smalller ; scientifically referred to as @entity41			2
they 're small enough to enter a person 's lungs			0
@entity41 is released from car exhausts , pictured , as well as other industrial , domestic and natural sources ' blue areas have experienced an improvement in air quality relative to 1850 and a decline in premature deaths			1
' ' @entity88 particulate matter takes an especially large toll in eastern @entity90 , northern @entity91 , and @entity98 - all areas where urbanisation has added considerable quantities of @entity41 to the atmosphere since the start of the @entity97			1
' it continued that areas , such as the southeastern states of the @entity102 , saw levels of @entity41 drop to levels seen before the development of industry			2
' the decrease in @entity41 is likely related to a decline in local biomass burning that has occurred over the last 160 years , ' explained the post			0
@entity7 's @entity6 claims that toxic pollution can linger in the air for ' days or even weeks ' and increases the number of people admitted to hospitals with breathing or heart problems .			2

@entity7 used global pollution data compiled by @entity121
dark brown areas show where more people *die* prematurely from air pollution than light brown areas
blue areas are regions where pollution levels have improved since 1850 - such as the southern states of the @entity102
the most polluted area is shown over @entity135 , in particular @entity90 , but @entity98 also has high levels of *damaging* soot , dust and car fumes
