@entity1 customers would be hit with a staggering £ 10 per month increase in their subscription rates , or £ 120 a year , to pay for the new £ 5 billion @entity5 deals if the broadcaster passed on the full cost to their ‘ football viewers ’ , according to analysts			1
while industry experts do not expect the price hikes to be quite that extreme in the immediate future , there is a broad consensus @entity17 customers will pay an initial rise of around £ 4 per month , or £ 48 per year , to help @entity17 meet the rights cost			1
even @entity17 insiders privately acknowledge that some of the cost will be passed on to customers			1
@entity1 pundits ( @entity25 ) @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 the @entity5 announced last week that @entity17 and @entity31 will together pay £ 5.136bn for live @entity33 rights to show games for three years from 2016 - 17 to 2018 - 19 inclusive			1
@entity17 will show 126 games per season ( up from 116 now ) , and @entity31 will show 42 , up from 38			0
but though the split from 2016 will remain much the same , @entity17 have paid massively more for their share in the new deal , or £ 1.392bn per year , up from £ 760m per year now			2
that annual extra spend of £ 632m every year will be partially offset by @entity17 no longer paying around £ 130m a year for @entity41 rights from next season , which they lost to @entity31			2
‘ @entity17 have made it clear they will do what they can to absorb the extra cost , ’ says @entity43 of industry experts @entity44			1
‘ but it ’s a bloody big sum to recover ’			0
@entity1 have paid £ 4.176 billion for @entity5 tv rights to show 126 matches mr @entity43 added that if the total extra spending by @entity17 were passed on solely to sports channel customers , around 5 million of them , it would result in a £ 10 per month extra charge , on top of the current £ 24.50 for sports channels bundle			1
‘ but £ 35 a month is the last thing @entity17 want [ to charge ] , ’ he says			2
his company estimates that @entity17 could instead raise around £ 100m in new income per year by levying an extra £ 1 a month on all customers , in which case a rise of few pounds a month to all @entity17 customers would pay for the rights			1
sources claim @entity31 always intended to give the impression they would bid huge sums - in order to force @entity17 to pay more , and then increase costs			0
analyst @entity73 , the chief market strategist at @entity74 , agrees			0
‘ @entity17 has paid 83 per cent more than it did last time for a similar range of match slots , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity17 has been duped into over-paying significantly and its now likely that its subscribers will have to absorb at least some of the additional cost as a result			0
’ @entity17 's @entity82 has become essential viewing for football fans around the country mr @entity73 estimates subscription fees will rise by up to £ 4 per month each year for the sports packages			1
a third expert , @entity88 of @entity89 , says losing the @entity41 was ‘ a blow ’ to @entity17 , meaning in terms screening @entity92 club side live in big events ‘ all their eggs are in one basket , the @entity5			2
’ mr @entity88 expects price rises to be introduced across @entity17 ’s customer base in a way that does not make it obvi - ous the cash is for the football			0
‘ in terms of visibility on how they achieve it , that ’s another matter			0
our view is @entity31 played a cool hand here and @entity17 had to go big to keep the packages			0

analysts reckon @entity17 customers would have to pay £ 10 per month extra if the full cost of the new @entity5 deal was passed on
industry experts do not expect the price hike to be so extreme
an initial rise of around £ 4 per month is expected
