by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's disease : @entity4 , 25 , from @entity5 , launched legal action at the @entity7 today a crohn 's disease sufferer is challenging what she claims is an ‘ unlawful ’ decision to refuse her funding for her eggs to be frozen before she undergoes chemotherapy			1
the judicial review action brought by artist @entity4 , 25 , from @entity17 , @entity5 , was ‘ exceptionally urgent ’ , a judge at the @entity7 in @entity15 heard today			1
her barrister told mr justice @entity20 , who was diagnosed with @entity3 's disease at the age of 14 , faces ‘ imminent ’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy - treatment she fears will render her infertile			1
one theory is that @entity3 's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut			2
so by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured			1
to have a bone marrow transplant , stem cells are removed , high - dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned			1
clinicians at @entity40 in @entity41 applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen before treatment			1
but @entity46 , representing miss @entity4 , said there was a ‘ continuing refusal ’ by @entity49 ( @entity50 ) to provide @entity52 - funded fertility preservation treatment , with the most recent refusal being on march 19			1
miss @entity4 , who was present in court , launched the legal action in a bid to overturn the refusal and keep alive her hopes of one day having children			1
she believes she is the victim of a ‘ postcode lottery ’ as the treatment is available to single women in other parts of the country			1
hearing : a judge at the @entity7 in @entity15 ( pictured ) was told today that a judicial review action brought by @entity20 was ' exceptionally urgent ' miss @entity4 , a @entity68 fine art graduate , said she is determined that the rules should be changed ‘ as this treatment is becoming more commonplace for @entity3 's disease sufferers and i would not want any other woman to have to go through this ordeal ’			1
in written argument before the judge , mr @entity46 submits that the refusal to fund the fertility preservation treatment , which would cost £ 4,050 , is unlawful ‘ because it was and continues to be defended on the basis of a policy which is unlawful and out of date ’			1
he told the judge : ‘ the expected consequence for her if the fertility preservation treatment is not provided is lifelong infertility and the inability to bear her own genetic child			2
oocyte cryopreservation takes a few weeks to complete and therefore there is a short window of opportunity			2
’ egg freezing is funded by the @entity52 if carried out for women having cancer treatment			2
after treatment , it costs £ 200 a year to pay for safe storage of the eggs			2
it 's claimed the chances of getting a baby from a frozen egg are about 1 to 3 per cent for each egg			2
also , only eight out of ten eggs survive the thawing process			0
before extacting the eggs , fertility drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries to produce follicles ( which contain the eggs )			0
the developing follicles are monitored and when they are large enough , they are carefully emptied to collect the eggs that they have produced			0
they are collected while the patient is under sedation or general anaesthetic			0
to freeze the eggs , they are placed in storage in liquid nitrogen and the standard storage period for eggs is normally 10 years			0
up to december 2012 , only 20 babies had been born in the @entity123 after treatment using patients ’ own frozen eggs ( although more have been born from donor eggs )			2
the case is being contested by @entity50 , which submits that its refusal is lawful			0
it has said in a statement : ‘ all @entity5 and @entity132 have agreed a policy on assisted reproductive techniques , including in relation to the freezing of eggs			1
‘ the policy all @entity5 and @entity132 have adopted , after extensive consultation and clinical advice , is that this particular procedure will not normally be funded by the @entity52 in @entity5 and @entity141 on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate effectiveness			1
‘ we are very sorry about the distress this may cause patients who are facing very difficult personal circumstances			0
‘ however , we must use our limited public money to fund services for our population as a whole and so are required to take difficult decisions on prioritising treatments			0
’ @entity157 , from law firm @entity158 , who is representing miss @entity4 , said in a statement : ‘ whilst we and our client appreciate there are limited funds available , @entity164 ( the @entity164 ) reviewed the clinical evidence and cost - effectiveness of this treatment and has recommended it should be offered			1
‘ @entity50 provide funding for fertility preservation for males and couples , also recommended by @entity164 on similar terms			0
it can not be right to not fund this treatment for women like @entity176			2
’ @entity3 ’s disease is a long - term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system			0
inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system , from the mouth to the back passage , but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine ( ileum ) or the large intestine ( colon )			0
symptoms include diarrhoea , abdominal pain , fatigue and weight loss and , in the long term , the inflammation can result in additional complications , such as narrowing of the colon			0
it is n’t fully understood what causes the condition but genes , a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role			0
there is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms			0
in up to 75 per cent of cases , surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system			0
one theory is that @entity3 's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut			0
so by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured			1
to have a bone marrow transplant , stem cells are removed , high - dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned			1
there are currently at least 115,000 people living with @entity3 ’s disease in the @entity234 's disease can affect people of all ages , including children			2
however , most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30 .			0
