premature : @entity0 , pictured with mother @entity1 , had just a 5 per cent chance of survival when she was born prematurely at 23 weeks			1
a significant number of babies born at 23 weeks now survive medical advances mean significant numbers of premature babies are surviving being born at 23 weeks – a time when they could still legally be aborted			1
improvements in specialist neo-natal care are likely to reopen the debate over the abortion limit			1
pro-life groups have long argued that no healthy baby should be aborted while they have a chance of life			1
current laws allow babies to be aborted at up to 24 weeks			1
some who defend the current threshold argue that the survival rate remains poor if a baby was born at that point			2
a commonly cited study , based on evidence gathered in 2006 , suggested that just 19 per cent of babies born at 23 weeks survived			1
but new research shows that many @entity31 specialist neo-natal units have vastly improved on those survival rates , and some even see the majority of babies born at 23 weeks surviving			1
data from 25 hospitals over the past four years shows that 120 babies born at 23 weeks survived			1
the figures , obtained via @entity38 , show that at @entity39 , six of eight babies born at 23 weeks last year survived			1
six of seven babies born at 23 weeks at @entity42 last year lived			1
all five born at that point at @entity44 last year also survived			0
the national rate of survival is likely to be far lower , especially at smaller hospitals without readily - available specialist care , but the figures demonstrate that if given the best care , babies are frequently surviving very premature births			2
around 560 babies are aborted at 23 weeks ’ gestation every year			2
dr @entity54 , clinical director of neo-natal services at @entity39 , said : ‘ it is a concentration of expertise , both in medical and nursing , that contribute to making a difference in survival at this very low gestation			0
’ the advance will trigger a renewed debate over abortion rules			0
pro-life groups have long argued that a foetus ’s development is very advanced by 23 weeks and aborting a baby at that point is wrong			1
many have called for the limit to be reduced to as little as 12 weeks			1
@entity72 , @entity74 mp and member of the all - party parliamentary pro-life group , said : ‘ i do not understand why there is not more outcry about the fact that we allow viable babies to be aborted			2
tiny : @entity0 was just 1lb , 3oz when she was born at 23 weeks - a time when she could still legally be aborted			1
pro-life groups have long argued that no healthy baby should be aborted while they have chance of life the new figures support what we have known for a while : that advances in pre-natal care make a mockery of our 24 - week abortion limit			1
’ however , mps have so far shown little appetite to change the rules			0
they were given a series of free votes on the issue in 2008 , with new suggested limits ranging from 12 to 22 weeks			0
the proposal for a 20 - week limit was defeated by 332 votes to 190			0
the closest vote , on a 22 - week limit , was defeated by 304 to 233			0
it was the first major challenge to @entity31 ’s abortion laws since 1990 , when the legal limit was lowered from 28 to 24 weeks			1
@entity110 , then @entity111 , voted in favour of the reduced limit at 22 and 20 weeks			0
@entity115 leader @entity114 voted to leave the limit			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ parliamentary practice is that any proposals to change abortion laws come from backbench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes			0
’ little girl who defied doctors ' predictions when @entity0 was born at 23 weeks , doctors gave her mother heartbreaking news			1
weighing 1lb 3oz , little @entity0 had just a 5 per cent chance of survival , they said			2
even if she did survive , they said her body was so under - developed that she would have long - term health problems and may need lifelong medical care			0
but , now aged five , @entity0 is now thriving as she starts school			2
thriving : even if @entity0 did survive , doctors said her body was so under - developed that she would have long - term health problems			2
but , now aged five , a happy and healthy @entity0 , pictured with her mother , is starting school her mother , @entity144 , 30 , said : ‘ to see @entity0 racing about so excited at starting school , you ’d never believe how tiny she was at birth and what a battle she has faced to live			2
‘ doctors told me she had less than a 5 per cent chance of survival and at one point she was so poorly , they even talked about turning off her life support			0
but @entity0 had other ideas			0
’ @entity0 stayed at @entity154 for 101 days after her birth in march 2009			0
she is now starting at @entity157 ’s @entity156 in @entity158 , near @entity154 – and there is barely a clue as to her difficult start to life			0
her mother said her daughter was a ‘ very clever , very active and very loving little girl ’			0
she added : ‘ i owe so much to the midwives , doctors and nurses who looked after her in those early days			0
