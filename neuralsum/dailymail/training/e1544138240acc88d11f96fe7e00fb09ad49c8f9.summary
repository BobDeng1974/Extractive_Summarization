father - of - three @entity1 , 56 , had only been on board for 10 yards when the vehicle began careering down a hill in @entity17			1
the driver of the single decker had passed out and the bus was rolling out of control towards a busy junction and traffic lights			1
when he realised what had happened , mr @entity1 , of @entity24 , @entity4 , jumped out of his seat but found he could not move the driver from his chair or reach the pedals			1

the incident happened on the 341 @entity42 to @entity4 service in @entity17 at 12.30pm on saturday			0
' i noticed the driver was leaning over but at first i thought he was checking the cash machine , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' but then there was a judder as we caught the kerb and slumped even further into the aisle			0
' my first thought was how to slow the bus down			0
i just did what came instinctively			0
' he had got on the @entity57 bus with his wife , @entity58 , 54 , and said he noticed something was wrong with the driver after just 10 yards			2

' i realised i could n't go fully into the trees as it might have flipped the bus over			2
' i 'm just glad everyone is safe , when the driver came round he had no idea what had happened and his eyes were glazed			0
' evasive action : mr @entity1 had to grab the wheel of the 341 bus , similar to this one , but could not stop it moving because the driver was slumped with his feet on the pedals incredible : the bus was heading down this hill towards a major junction before mr @entity1 took control @entity1 , who has a three sons - @entity91 , 29 , @entity92 , 27 , and @entity93 , 21 , said : ' i just did what i needed to do			1

' she thought he was just checking his mirrors then realised he had actually passed out			0
' the man who steered the bus is the one who saved the day			0
i did n't even get his name but i thanked him once we stopped and he waited for the police and ambulance to arrive			0
