host commentator host commentator @entity1 will face @entity2 in the quarter finals of the @entity4 after a convincing win against @entity7 strugglers @entity6			1
the game was over after @entity1 's 5 - 0 win in the first leg but @entity12 's side maintained their professionalism to complete the job			1
@entity15 heads in @entity1 's fourth to complete the scoring with just seconds to go			1
@entity17 is called into action as he palms out the first shot before making sure he holds on to the second effort at goal			2
we are into the final minute			0
@entity6 are trying their best to score a goal but they have been unable to really test @entity17			1
@entity28 's @entity27 : ' @entity26 is the seventh youth player that @entity12 has given his debut to since he has been at the club			2
whatever you think of the coach , he 's certainly buying in to the @entity35 philosophy			0
he might as well as he wo n't be buying anything else because of the transfer ban			0
' @entity26 produces a terrific piece of skill before curling the ball towards goal			0
however the woodwork comes to @entity6 's rescue as his shot cannons off the post			2
he looks a real talent			0
20 minutes left to play			0
@entity1 's youngsters are playing in a similar mould to the first team			1
neat , intricate passing in the final third			0
no wonder @entity12 is all smiles			2
highly - rated teenager @entity26 has been brought on to make his debut for @entity1 's first team			1
the @entity57 giants beat off competition from their @entity60 rivals to sign the 18 - year - old in the summer			0
it feels like a low - profile friendly match now			0
an easy night for @entity1 's players			1
@entity6 have rarely threatened despite trying their best to give their fans something to celebrate			2
@entity28 's @entity27 : ' some interesting goalkeeping from @entity17 there			2
perhaps he 's been watching too much of his countryman , @entity71			0
then again , maybe he thinks he can handle an outfield jaunt tonight because @entity6 have n't been at the races so far			2
@entity76 youngster @entity75 , meanwhile , has made three not - inconsiderable fouls , but has thus far avoided a booking			0
@entity79 will be taking note			0
' @entity81 will be hoping he can impress enough to earn himself a start in @entity7			2
however it must be hard for the 22 - year - old when you are competing with @entity86 and @entity87			0
@entity1 starlet @entity88 should have added a fourth however his cross-cum - shot goes just wide of @entity91 's goal			1
the moment of the first half was definitely @entity95 's free - kick			1
@entity87 would have been proud of that strike ! @entity12 's side are 3 - 0 up on the night without even stepping into second gear			1
@entity6 's players will be dreading the second half			2
@entity101 is fouled inside the area - leaving @entity103 to net from the spot			1
it 's just too easy for @entity1 's ' weakened ' side			2
@entity107 doubles his side 's lead with a left - footed drive from the edge of the box			2
it is now 7 - 0 to @entity1 on aggregate			1
@entity115 must have woken up after that strike ! substitute @entity115 looks extremely bored on the subs ' bench			0
he probably wanted the night off alongside the likes of @entity87 and @entity86			0
@entity103 ran to celebrate with @entity95 after the opener			1
@entity1 's stand - in captain is being given the time and space to dictate play but has not been able to unlock @entity6 's defence thus far			1
@entity126 : ' only around 8,000 here tonight , but who can blame @entity6 's fans ? it 's been a miserable season and with @entity1 5 - 0 up from the first leg , there 's not even the draw of seeing any of the major @entity1 stars			1
oh , and the game kicked off at 10pm local time - on a school night			0
' @entity95 's last goal came at the back end of last season for @entity140			0
he was congratulated by his team - mates after his opener			2
@entity28 's @entity27 : ' @entity95 has been a good signing this season but people frequently comment that he can look a bit cumbersome , a bit clumsy			0
there was nothing cumbersome about that free kick though			0
@entity87 has some competition for those set - plays ... ' @entity95 's goal was his first competitive goal for @entity1			1
i wonder if @entity87 will let the @entity154 take free - kicks in future matches ... @entity157 gets a yellow card for a deliberate foul			1
@entity1 open the scoring with a tremendous free - kick through @entity162			1
18 minutes gone and @entity1 's defenders seem to be content with passing the ball around			0
@entity6 look lively but have not threatened @entity17 's goal			1
@entity103 is captaining @entity1 in the absence of @entity87 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
@entity169 has just missed a great chance from close range			0
attention has turned to @entity1 who are hoping to book a date with @entity2			0
@entity87 , @entity175 and @entity86 have all been given a night off due to @entity1 's 5 - 0 lead			1
the holders are out ! @entity178 and @entity2 have drawn 2 - 2 in their second leg meaning @entity2 go through 4 - 2 on aggregate			0
@entity181 was on target twice for @entity2			0
' in stark contrast to the scenes we saw outside of the @entity187 , with the streets full of supporters , there 's little atmosphere for this game			0
it 's largely because @entity1 ended it in the first leg , with a brutal and relentless barrage of attacks that saw off @entity6			1
that said , there was still a fair crowd to greet @entity1 's team bus tonight			2
' what tonight 's about , for @entity12 , is giving the youngsters a chance to shine and making sure the team arrives in high spirits for the trip to the @entity207 , to face @entity208 on sunday			2
' the teams are in ... @entity1 have made a number of changes @entity1 : @entity17 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity95 , @entity15 , @entity214 , @entity107 , @entity215 , @entity103 , @entity101 , @entity88 subs : @entity217 , @entity115 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity26 , @entity220 , @entity221 @entity6 : @entity91 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 subs : @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity169 , @entity237 , @entity238 hello and welcome to the @entity4 clash between @entity6 and @entity1			1
@entity1 won the first leg 5 - 0 at the @entity241 last week , so there is little doubt about who will progress to the next round			1
@entity12 changed his @entity1 line - up for the 28th time in a row , dropping @entity87 , @entity86 and @entity175 , but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the @entity4 quarter - finals			1
the @entity254 coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off @entity2 last weekend and the reserves responded impressively , to offer @entity259 's side the chance of revenge in the next round			0
two brilliant first half goals from @entity95 and @entity107 set @entity1 on their way , before @entity103 and @entity15 added two more , and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire , gently stirred by the odd @entity6 effort whizzing over the crossbar			1
