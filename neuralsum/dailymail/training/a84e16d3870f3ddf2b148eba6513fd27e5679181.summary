by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 : 08:32 est , 1 february 2014 after one of the great diplomatic custard pies of our age – an incident which makes prince @entity8 look like @entity9 – the @entity12 - @entity11 summit repaired to an @entity14 pub. @entity15 , a pint of neat gin for my @entity19 pal , please			1
@entity22 at @entity23 , pretty place , has appeared in @entity25			0
president @entity26 was taken there and offered potted shrimps , a spot of trout and apple crumble for afters			1
they even opened a bottle of @entity19 wine			1
but it might as well have been @entity44 2014			0
for a terrible deed had been done			0
minutes earlier those vilipendious vipers of ze @entity11 press had done it again			2
@entity49 ! @entity50 ! they had raised the unmentionable			0
they had contravened the carefully constructed , @entity54 , bullet - proofed niceties of presidential etiquette			0
they had asked about – zut , eek , aiee – le legeauver			2
the scene of the crime was a hangar at @entity62 , where @entity35 and his intimates ( that is , his advisers – for goodness ’ sake , you ’re as bad as the rest of us ) had arrived after breakfast			1
@entity19 president @entity26 was seen running out of the pub where he met @entity36 for lunch the @entity12 appeared to want a quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with mr @entity36 on @entity77 and face tricky questions about his love life their dinky little executive jet had dropped through the misty heavens and a great - coated @entity36 was on hand as the doors opened			1
he ’d make a fair hotel commissionaire , young @entity36			1
i hope the air hostess was all right			0
behind him was the customary @entity19 military bod with kepi and a uniform adorned with scrambled - egg braid			2
he follows le president ( nearly ) wherever he goes and carries @entity12 ’s nuclear - bomb codes in an impressive briefcase			2
or at least that is what we are always told			0
i suppose it may simply contain some sandwiches to keep the fellow going until elevenses			0
at the sight of the president the splendid @entity106 band burst into the @entity109			2
should have given him a blast of the @entity113 , lads			0
awkward : @entity36 and @entity26 tried to look relaxed at @entity115 barely an hour after they clashed over the need to reform the @entity117 after tense talks at the summit prime minister @entity36 took @entity19 president @entity26 to @entity115 at @entity23 in @entity14 for lunch foreign secretary @entity122 , defence secretary @entity123 , energy secretary @entity124 and universities minister @entity125 were in the welcome line			1
an @entity106 officer was wearing the sort of white gloves favoured by snooker refs			0
he gave one of those salutes that judders for half a minute after it has been made			0
twangggg ! the summit was ostensibly about defence			2
deals have been agreed on a maritime anti-mine gizmo , a space programme , a drone project and continued @entity12 - @entity11 military co-operation			2
one of the prototype designs of the drone was in the hangar , as were lots of @entity19 journos and the @entity19 foreign minister ( who had trouble keeping his eyes open during mr @entity36 ’s little speech )			1
the @entity19 press corps has proved supine during the scandal of president @entity26 and his girlfriends			1
@entity19 president @entity26 refused to comment on whether his affair has made @entity12 an international joke double trouble : mr @entity26 refused to comment on his affair with actress @entity160 ( right ) or the status of former first lady @entity162 the old ‘ right to privacy ’ gambit has been deployed – by a man who controls the codes to nuclear war ! has anyone actually checked to see if his popsy is an enemy agent ? or do i contravene the sensibilities of some @entity173 if i make that point ? some say the president ’s trouser - dropping is no business of we @entity179			1
but here he was , signing military communiques with our lot , in the process learning some of our military secrets			0
none of our business ? @entity188 and mr @entity36 had been asked about @entity117 treaty re-negotiations			1
@entity35 , taller than @entity190 but not much , radiated nonchalance			0
mentioning the @entity192 , he oozed superiority – he genuinely seemed to think we might covet that currency			0
in june 2010 mr @entity36 and wife @entity196 hosted then - @entity19 president @entity197 and his wife @entity198 for lunch in 10 @entity200 @entity201 and @entity202 welcomed @entity19 president @entity203 and his wife @entity204 to @entity200 in 2004 previous pub diplomacy : @entity206 sought to win over @entity19 president @entity203 in 2000 with a pint in the @entity209 restaurant in the @entity211 's constituency in @entity212 ahead of a summit in @entity12 then , at 12.33pm , it happened			1
@entity215 popped one of @entity217 ’s finest and said : ‘ do you think your private life has made @entity12 an international joke ? ' are you still having an affair with @entity160 and do you wish she was here ? ’ @entity36 doodled , jolly , jolly hard			1
the @entity19 journos sucked in their cheeks			2
and monsieur le @entity86 , tapping his ballpoint on his lectern , snapped that he most certainly did not intend to answer zat feelthy question			0
as moments go , a bit of a bottom - clencher			0
the mistress of president @entity26 was yesterday nominated for a @entity19 @entity233 – for playing a sex - obsessed government aide			1
@entity160 , 41 , is in the running for a @entity236 , the highest honour in @entity19 cinema , for best supporting actress in @entity240			1
the comedy film is named after the @entity243 quay where @entity12 ’s foreign ministry is based and miss @entity160 plays a mini-skirted adviser who uses her feminine charms to seduce powerful men			2
in real life , the actress was having a passionate affair with the @entity19 president , 59 , while he was still living with girlfriend @entity162			1
the two secret lovers regularly met in a flat close to the @entity254 .			0

@entity19 president *challenged* during press *conference* at @entity62
@entity26 was asked if he is still having an affair with actress @entity160
questioned if he wished she was with him at the @entity19 summit
@entity264 left at home after @entity36 agreed no spouses at event
