by @entity0 exploding head syndrome may sound like a made - up condition - in fact , it 's a real and frightening medical disorder , and one that a study suggests is surprisingly common			0
people with exploding head syndrome ( @entity7 ) hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking up			1
the type of noise can vary from explosions and fireworks to slammed doors , the sound of a gun firing , an enormous roar , shouting , thunder or a crack of lightning			0
the noises start suddenly and last for a few seconds			1
before hearing the loud noise , one in ten also has visual disturbances , such as seeing lightning or flashes			2
these are similar to the auras some people have before a migraine headache			2
people with exploding head syndrome ( @entity7 ) hear loud noises when going to sleep or on waking up ' in contrast to migraine , visual symptoms are brief - typically a single flash , ' says dr @entity34 , a consultant neurologist at the @entity35 , @entity36			1
exploding head syndrome may also cause a mild headache and sensations of heat ; other symptoms include a jerk or ' jumping ' limbs at the same time			0
while some have only one attack in their life , others experience up to seven a night			0
they may come and go over weeks or months , though for some they occur almost daily for years			0
it can lead to sleeping problems and worse : an attack may cause temporary tachycardia - a faster heart rate than normal - and palpitations			1
in the longer term it can also lead to panic disorder , depression and catastrophising , where patients misinterpret symptoms as signs of more serious conditions , such as a stroke			2
' i have assessed patients reporting apprehension who avoid sleep during chronic bouts of @entity7 , ' says dr @entity69 , an assistant professor of psychology at @entity71			1
' it can be very frightening and scary for those who do not know what is happening			0
' it can lead to sleeping problems and worse : an attack may cause temporary tachycardia and a study published in the journal @entity80 suggests that the disorder may affect as many as one in ten people at some time during their life			1
' it has been claimed that @entity7 is rare , but preliminary data does not appear to imply rarity , ' says dr @entity69 , who led the study			1
the disorder is known to be twice as common in women and typically affects the over- 50s , though it has also been reported in children as young as ten			0
quite why it occurs is not clear			0
one theory is that it is caused by ear problems , especially those affecting the eustachian tube , which links the middle ear with the back of the nose and throat			2
problems here can affect air pressure in the middle ear , which can cause the perception of sounds when there are none			2
exploding head syndrome is also linked to rapid withdrawal from certain drugs such as benzodiazepines , given for anxiety or sleeping problems , or anti-depressants called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors			1
however , dr @entity69 says the most likely explanation is that there is some kind of temporary blip in the nerve cells of the brain during the switch from being awake to sleeping			1
when we go to sleep , the brain orchestrates a switching off of various regions responsible for movement , vision , sound and so on			2
it 's thought that @entity7 occurs because of a delay in this shut - down , resulting in a burst of activity - this is perceived as loud noises and flashes of light			1
yet even though it was identified 150 years ago , researchers say @entity7 remains little known			1
' it is an entirely benign and non-threatening condition , ' says dr silver			2
however , lack of awareness means it 's often misdiagnosed , as ' night - time ' epilepsy , thunder - clap headaches - sudden , severe pain that peaks within 60 seconds - or nightmare disorder , where people often wake with detailed recall of frightening dreams			2
it is also misdiagnosed as migraine , cluster headaches - severe pain on one side , often behind the eye - and post-traumatic stress disorder flashbacks			0
' because a diagnosis of @entity7 does not occur to a lot of doctors , it is not uncommon to see patients having investigations to rule out disorders such as subarachnoid haemorrhage ( sudden bleeding around the brain ) or epilepsy , ' says dr silver			1
patients may be given scans or even a lumbar puncture - where a needle is used to remove spinal fluid to check for subarachnoid haemorrhage			0
' my main concern is the lack of recognition of this disorder among the public , but also possibly among the medical profession as it does not feature highly in standard textbooks on medicine or neurology , ' says dr silver			0
he stresses the importance of educating doctors who have not come across @entity7 - ' so patients with this syndrome are not put through probable unnecessary scans or lumbar punctures '			1
' as with most neurological conditions , diagnosis relies on taking a good history from the patient and excluding more worrisome possibilities			0
' for without a diagnosis , people with @entity7 will also miss out on receiving proper treatment			1
the good news , says dr @entity69 , is that while @entity7 can be scary , it is generally harmless			1
' any problems tend to be because of the way people react to episodes , such as misinterpreting them as indicative of a more serious condition , or avoiding sleep			1
' most patients simply require reassurance			0
' i find lifestyle advice , for instance avoiding caffeine before bed , is all they need , ' says dr silver			0
there are drug treatments that may be effective , including the antidepressant clomipramine , calcium channel - blockers and anticonvulsants - typically used for epilepsy - though it 's not clear how these work			0
' drug treatment is reserved for those with frequent symptoms , ' says dr silver .			0
