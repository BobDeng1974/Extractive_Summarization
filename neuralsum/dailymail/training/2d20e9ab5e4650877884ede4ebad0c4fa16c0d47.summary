by @entity0 @entity2 's attempt to register the word ' @entity4 ' as s a trademark for its electronic glasses has been stalled by the @entity8 ' @entity7			1
the firm is involved in a long - running row over the word , with experts claiming it is too generic to be patented and the @entity14 rejecting @entity2 's application			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , claims the word applies to its entire glass product , which includes frames , and not just the glass component			1
a trademark examiner raised two objections , one of which was that the trademark was too similar to other trademarks containing the word ' glass ' , which could lead to confusion for consumers			2
while @entity2 has already registered the term ' @entity32 ' as a trademark , a report in the @entity31 this week revealed that the @entity34 has objected to the ' @entity35 , submitted last year			1
according to the report , a trademark examiner raised two objections , one of which was that the trademark was too similar to other trademarks containing the word ' glass ' , which could lead to confusion for consumers			0
the other objection was that the word ' glass ' was merely descriptive , ans that such generic terms can not be trademarked under @entity8 federal law			0
@entity2 's trademark attorneys wrote a 1,928 - page letter to the government in response to the @entity7 's decision to stall the trademark application			1
however , the letter from @entity2 's lawyers contained around 1,900 articles about @entity32 , with the remainder of the letter disputing the trademark examiner ’s objection that using the word ' glass ' as a trademark would confuse consumers and the assertion that it was merely a descriptive word			1
it also singled out other firms that have the word glass in their logo			2
the @entity7 has yet to make a final ruling on the application			0
the @entity14 document concluded that ' @entity4 ' would be ' be understood as describing a feature of some the goods , namely , that some of the goods will incorporate display screens and / or lenses that are or will be made of , inter alia , glass			0
' although @entity2 is not required to trademark the word in order to use it for its glasses device , if the company is not to able to register ‘ @entity4 ’ as a trademark , it will make it much harder to counter trademark infringements			2
similarities between @entity32 and other existing trademarks , including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , are also likely to confuse consumers , it is believed			0
the @entity7 has yet to make a final ruling on the application .			0
