@entity8 has rescued about 5,200 men , women and children and recovered three dead bodies from overcrowded boats in the @entity47 since early thursday			1
calm seas have led to this latest wave of migrants who have left @entity3 shores for @entity8 over just three days , a navy spokesman told @entity53 , with merchant ships and a @entity13 vessel also aiding in the rescue efforts			2
the surge in arrivals is straining the ability of the @entity8 naval mission - called @entity60 or ' @entity60 ' - to patrol the waters between @entity63 and @entity8 on its own			0
it has prompted local officials in @entity37 , where most of the migrants are taken , to call for more @entity68 support			1
' @entity68 ca n't just turn its back on us , ' @entity69 , mayor of the @entity37 port city of @entity72 , said in a television interview on sunday			1

@entity60 began last october after 366 migrants fleeing @entity3 countries drowned when their boat capsized a mile from @entity37			1
after the tragedy , the @entity98 pledged 30 million euros ( $ 40.85 million ) in emergency funding , mainly targeted to fund immigration facilities on land			0
the number of boat migrants who have reached @entity8 this year has already topped the total of more than 40,000 for the whole of 2013			0
the pace of arrivals is on track to exceed the record of 62,000 set in 2011 during the @entity119 uprisings			0
two - thirds of the migrants , who come from dozens of countries and include @entity123 fleeing civil war and @entity125 evading military conscription , leave @entity8 for other @entity98 countries , the @entity120 said			2
' the ones who arrived yesterday left immediately			0
we saw them walking down state - road 115 , ' @entity130 said in the televisions interview			0

prime minister @entity137 has urged the @entity138 to intervene in @entity139 , where criminal gangs charge migrants more than $ 1,000 each for a spot on unsafe vessels , to try to limit the departures			0
the recent flood of boat migrants has helped revive @entity8 's anti-immigrant @entity148 party , which had lost much of its support over the last two years due to corruption scandals and leadership changes .			2
