patients without a supportive network of friends and family around them are three times more likely to fall behind with their treatment than those who are n't lonely , according to a new study among cancer patients who are lonely in the @entity21 : its poll of more than 1,000 people from across the @entity21 who had ever been diagnosed with cancer , found that one in five have been lonely since their diagnosis			1
almost a third of those who said they had been lonely said they faced at least one issue with their treatment plan compared with 11 per cent who had not felt alone			0
@entity36 , head of health and social care at @entity12 said : ‘ lonely cancer patients may not have the practical support they need to get out of the house and attend their appointments , or pick up prescriptions , especially if they ca n’t drive or live in a remote area			1
‘ or they may feel emotionally overwhelmed and too anxious to attend appointments or have treatment			0
we know patients who have only attended appointments because friends or family persuaded them			0
’ some 20,000 lonely cancer patients in the @entity21 are having difficulty with their treatment , the charity said			1
many lonely cancer patients ( illustrated with a stock image ) are missing appointments , not taking their medication properly , ca n't pick up prescriptions or even refusing treatment , @entity12 said @entity61 , 61 , from @entity62 , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 said : ' none of my family or friends live near me , so although i could stay with a friend after surgery , when i was told i ’d need six months of chemotherapy the only thing going through my mind was : " how am i going to cope ? " ' i could n’t ask anyone to stay with me for such a long time or afford to be off work with no one else to help pay the mortgage			1
so i turned the chemotherapy treatment down			0
' it was a horrible situation to be in , alone with life - changing decisions to make and i know i risked the chance of the cancer returning			0
' one in 30 people are estimated to have skipped treatment appointments and one in 17 did n’t take medicine as they should			2
one in eight patients could n’t pick up prescriptions , while one in 11 refused some type of treatment			2
a total of five per cent of cancer patients refused treatment all together			0
@entity94 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ we already know that loneliness may be as harmful as smoking but this research shows for the first time that it is particularly toxic to cancer patients			0
‘ it is simply unacceptable that so many cancer patients feel emotionally alone or lack practical support to such an extent that they are missing appointments , unable to take their medicine or even refusing treatment , and that it ’s putting their recovery at risk			1
‘ with @entity21 currently the loneliness capital of @entity114 and the cancer population set to double to four million by 2030 , the problem ’s only going to get worse			2
we need to urgently tackle it now			0
‘ that ’s why we ’re calling on health professionals to identify lonely cancer patients and make them aware of the support available so that they do n’t have to go through their cancer alone			2

patients without support are 3 times as likely to have treatment problems
many miss appointments and do n't pick up or take their medicine
@entity12 polled 1,000 people to *highlight* the problem
it estimates some 20,000 people in the @entity21 are lonely and *battling* cancer
