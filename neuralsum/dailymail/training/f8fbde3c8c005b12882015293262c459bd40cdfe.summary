baby boom : a new study reveals that fertility rates among highly educated career women are on the rise according to their research , @entity18 women with college degrees have a fertility rate of 1.88 children - a figure that rises to 1.96 for those with advanced degrees			1
this is a significant rise from 1980 , when the fertility rate was 1.2 for women who had studied for 16 years or more			1
' the relationship between fertility and women ’s education in the @entity18 has recently become u-shaped , ' say the researchers			1

explanation : researchers believe the results of the study are down to a rapidly rising inequality gap between women : those who work hard and can afford to pay for childcare and those who provide the services at an affordable price ' you have a nanny , people to pick up your laundry and suits , buy you food from the local store for you to cook for dinner , and you can leave all the mess to the housekeeper in the morning			1
