critical : a group of former @entity2 has slated @entity8 for national security leaks including information surrounding the death of @entity11 compromised : the video released by a group of military experts believes that the assassination of @entity11 ( left ) was compromised by the speed in which president @entity8 ( right ) announced it to the country ' i said that i 'd go after @entity11 if we had a clear shot at him , and i did , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' if there are others who have said one thing and now suggest they 'd do something else , then i 'd go ahead and let them explain it			0

combat : the new video suggests that @entity8 is fighting personal political battles using the work of the @entity12 military intelligence : retired @entity6 officer @entity191 ( left ) and operative @entity192 ( right ) , who could not reveal his identity , spoke of the dangers that the @entity12 military were being placed in because of government leaks @entity36 , president of @entity197 and a former seal who ran unsuccessfully for the @entity59 nomination for a congressional seat in @entity201 in 2010 , said his group was a ' watchdog organisation ' but added that the @entity8 administration ' has certainly leaked more than others '			1
@entity205 , a former @entity6 case and now @entity14 spokesman , said its focus on leaks was ' not a partisan concern ' but the @entity8 administration had been leaking ‘ to help this guy get re-elected , at the expense of peoples ' lives ' , adding : ' we want to see that they do n't do this again			2
' the @entity8 administration is pointing to a @entity223 interview last month in which admiral @entity219 , who oversaw the raid , said : ' at the end of the day , make no mistake about it , it was the president of the @entity12 that shouldered the burden for this operation , that made the hard decisions , that was instrumental in the planning process , because i pitched every plan to him			2
