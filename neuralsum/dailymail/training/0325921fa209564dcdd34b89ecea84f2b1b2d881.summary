@entity8 - @entity65 was arrested after falsely reporting a woman had kidnapped her 16 - month - old son
the 18 - year - old had actually signed over custody of the toddler to the woman in nonlegal documents earlier this month to live a ' normal life '
she then changed her number so the woman , who is homeless and a heroin addict , could not contact her
@entity65 , who was charged with making a false report and endangering the welfare of a child , was smiling in her mugshot
