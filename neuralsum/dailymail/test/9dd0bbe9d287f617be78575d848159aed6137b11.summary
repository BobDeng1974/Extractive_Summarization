@entity1 boss @entity0 was left fuming on the sidelines after his relegation - threatened side were denied a penalty in their narrow @entity6 defeat at @entity7			1
the hosts had led through first - half goals by @entity10 and @entity11 , before @entity12 pulled one back for fourth - bottom @entity1			1
however , @entity15 's clumsy handling of @entity16 near the hour mark saw the @entity18 forward go down in the box only for referee @entity20 to wave away appeals for a spot - kick , leaving the @entity24 boss visibly enraged as the home side held out			0
@entity10 of @entity7 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game @entity10 ( centre ) finished low to put @entity7 ahead against @entity1 at @entity29 @entity7 : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity15 , @entity33 , @entity10 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 ' ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 67 ' ) , @entity11 subs not used : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 booked : @entity36 , @entity33 goals : @entity10 27 ' @entity47 ' @entity1 : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 52 ' ) , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 ' ) , @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 63 ' ) , @entity16 subs not used : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 booked : @entity51 , @entity50 goals : @entity16 48 ' referee : @entity20 attendance : 16,569 @entity36 was unfortunate to be flagged offside from @entity11 's early flick - on while winger @entity38 's ball into the box from the left was dangerous but fruitless			1
@entity35 forced a good low save from @entity48 with a drive from just outside the area in the 19th minute as @entity77 's side continued to press			0
the deadlock was broken in the 27th minute with a well - worked but uncomplicated attack			0
@entity10 found space just outside the box and after a one - two with @entity11 , side - footed coolly into the bottom - right corner to leave @entity48 with no chance			1
@entity36 headed @entity35 's excellent cross over in the 38th minute after @entity11 's slight touch beforehand slightly changed the flight of the ball but eventually the second did come two minutes before the break			0
@entity35 hit a free - kick from distance with trademark power and accuracy and when @entity48 palmed it back into play , rather than for a corner , @entity11 pounced with an easy diving header			2
@entity51 of @entity1 puts @entity11 of @entity7 in a headlock @entity7 manager @entity77 watches the action from the sidelines of the @entity6 clash @entity7 's @entity35 holds off challenge from @entity1 's @entity102 ( right ) @entity11 fired a decent effort over on the turn as @entity105 sensed blood before the half was over			1
@entity1 gained a foothold less than three minutes into the second half , however			2
slack defensive play left @entity7 goalkeeper @entity30 in bother and when he only palmed @entity55 's shot to @entity16 , the deficit was halved as the striker tapped home with ease			0
@entity55 then had a chance saved as @entity30 kept out a deflected effort , while @entity48 reacted quickly as @entity11 broke through at the other end			0
colourful @entity24 boss @entity0 was incandescent with rage on the hour mark when his side were denied a penalty , with @entity16 bearing down on goal only to go down when tangling with home defender @entity15 as the centre - half looked to atone for an error seconds earlier			1
@entity16 was not far off with a 76th - minute header , while @entity11 and substitute @entity39 both came agonisingly close at point - blank range and @entity10 twice fired straight at @entity48 as the home side missed numerous chances to make the win more comfortable .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 struck in first half for @entity7
@entity12 pulled one back after the *interval* for @entity1
@entity1 boss @entity0 left fuming after being denied a penalty
