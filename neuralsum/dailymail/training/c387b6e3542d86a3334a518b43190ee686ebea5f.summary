by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a day after the government proudly declared it had met its weekend deadline for making @entity6 operate smoothly for most users , it admitted @entity8 would still have problems enrolling online			1
aides to the president admitted sunday that peak traffic volumes could make the site crash			1
while saying @entity6 had improved , president @entity15 's adviser @entity14 also warned that peak traffic volumes during the coming weeks could overwhelm it as consumers scramble to sign up before a december 23 deadline for coverage that begins january 1			1
could crash : @entity14 , standing here next to president @entity15 , admits that peak traffic volumes during the coming weeks could overwhelm the site as consumers scramble to sign up before a december 23 deadline networks of volunteer organizations are expected to resume enrollment activities after a long @entity8 @entity33 holiday weekend , many of them with backlogs of would - be applicants waiting for access			1
enroll @entity8 , the nonprofit group that serves as a flagship for private sector enrollment efforts under @entity15 's landmark healthcare law , said it planned to launch a new ' coverage is coming ' push , with more than 1,000 events over the next three weeks ranging from commemorations of @entity43 to community health summits and holiday toy drives , according to @entity47 spokesman @entity46			1
@entity51 , a statewide non-profit organization that received a federal grant to help people enroll , had been relying largely on paper applications to sign people up until last week , when they noticed major improvement in the website , said @entity56 , the organization 's director of policy and advocacy			2
one glitch the organization came across last week involved apparently incorrect information about tax subsidies , @entity56 said			0
for example , she said , people who appeared to be eligible for subsidies given their income levels were told they did not qualify			0
on time : healthcare officials said sunday that they made the self - imposed deadline to make the @entity71 website usable for 50,000 applicants at one time banks said the organization planned a radio campaign as part of a push to get people enrolled by december 23 so they could have coverage starting next year			1
' we really are going to push super-hard the next 23 days to get people enrolled for the january 1st deadline , ' @entity56 said			2
the @entity85 , which plans to hold public education events about the healthcare law throughout december , will hold a @entity88 on wednesday to help drive outreach and enrollment over the remaining four - month enrollment period			2
the number who need coverage starting january 1 could include millions of uninsured @entity8 with preexisting health conditions and others who have been notified that their current health plans will expire at year - end because they do not meet @entity71 's standards for benefits and consumer protection			1
good news : according to the eight - page report released this morning , the website has made ' dramatic progress ' in ' doubling ' site capacity @entity14 said on sunday a five - week emergency ' tech surge ' had doubled the capacity of the online health insurance portal that is crucial to helping people shop for insurance plans , while making it more responsive and less prone to errors			1
the administration said the effort 's key improvement was to increase @entity6 's capacity to 50,000 simultaneous users , which would allow the site to handle a minimum of 800,000 users per day			1
officials acknowledged however that the site may not operate smoothly for some visitors even when the capacity has not been exceeded , and said they were still scrambling to repair and install functions at the crucial ' back end ' of the system that are needed to finalize enrollments with insurers			1
' the real challenges remain , and that 's downstream , ' said @entity133 , research director for the technology consultant @entity135			0
' the real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is			0
' not over yet : the real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is , say researchers @entity144 , a health economist at @entity146 's @entity145 , said sunday 's announcement represented ' dramatic progress ' , but that the fixes mainly brought the website to ' the baseline of what we need the site to be able to do '			1
officials are working to correct errors in the consumer enrollment data sent to insurers and have not built in several necessary functions , including one that will enable the government to pay federal subsidies to insurers on behalf of low - income enrollees			2
without those functions working properly , @entity6 and websites for 14 state - run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014			0
even so , officials said , the site is dramatically better than when it was launched on october 1			0
necessary : officials are working to correct errors in the consumer enrollment data sent to insurers and have not built in several necessary functions			0
without them , the site could have difficulty operating in 2014 it was overwhelmed by users in a debacle that fueled @entity181 ' complaints about the @entity184 president 's healthcare overhaul and threatened to make his signature domestic achievement a drag on @entity184 heading into the 2014 elections			2
the @entity191 team 's success could mark a more upbeat chapter for the @entity71 , also known as @entity71			0
the law is designed to help provide coverage to millions of uninsured and under - insured @entity8			0
longer - term questions remain about whether the program will be able to enroll the estimated 7 million people it needs by the end of march to be financially viable , including millions of healthy , young enrollees who are needed to keep the program 's costs in check			0
' the issue is really the management capacity of the @entity15 administration , ' said @entity207 , a @entity208 expert on healthcare and public opinion			2
' if the website really is still working a week from now , it 'll make people feel at least they have the capacity to turn things around and move ahead			0
' glitch : one of the issues people have experienced is those who appeared to be eligible for tax subsidies given their income levels were told they did not qualify			0
