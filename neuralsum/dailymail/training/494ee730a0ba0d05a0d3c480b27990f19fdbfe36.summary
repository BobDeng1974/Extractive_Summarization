a @entity1 tribe in @entity2 has been awarded custody this week of a four - month - old baby who was adopted by a @entity6 couple			1
the case has drawn comparisons to the long - running adoption dispute over three - year - old @entity11 girl @entity10 and led to criticisms of ' human trafficking ' from tribes			0
in the latest case , an @entity16 district court judge awarded custody of baby @entity19 , who had been adopted by a couple from outside the state , to the @entity22			1
inquiry : tribe attorney @entity24 says adoption lawyers should be investigated custody : @entity27 is representing the @entity6 couple the case echoes that of three - year - old @entity10 , who was also put up for adoption by her birth mother , only for the biological father to later object			1
a federal law called the @entity35 mandates strict procedures for guardianship and custody of @entity1 children			1
the unnamed couple who adopted @entity19 were present at her birth in may			1
they returned with her to @entity6 in june so the father could return to work			0
but the baby 's biological father , @entity45 , who is not @entity1 , is seeking custody			1
because @entity19 's biological mother is a tribal member , the @entity22 stepped in and was awarded custody this week			0
the @entity35 mandates that @entity1 children enrolled in a tribe must first be placed with an extended family member , another tribal member who is not a family member or another @entity1 from a different tribe			1
this summer , the @entity56 @entity55 ruled that @entity57 , a @entity58 member who is seeking custody of his daughter , @entity10 , could not use the law to press his claims for custody			1
@entity10 's biological mother is not @entity1			1
courts in @entity6 and @entity2 have ordered mr @entity57 to hand over the girl to @entity67 and @entity68 , but mr @entity57 has refused			0
custody battle : @entity10 , pictured above with biological father @entity57 has been at the center of a custody tug - of - war for her entire life a lawyer representing the @entity22 in the @entity19 case said he fears the tribe could have trouble in its effort to bring @entity19 back to @entity2			2
@entity24 said he believes the @entity6 - based adoption lawyer , @entity79 , who helped set up adoption cases involving @entity10 and @entity19 , and other adoption lawyers should be investigated by the @entity83			0
he told @entity84 last month that tribal attorneys were caught off guard in may when they heard that @entity19 had been moved to @entity2			0
' she was already gone and out of the state before we even received notice , ' he claimed			0
' the adoptive couple paid their money and took off with the kid without the required approval of either the @entity2 or the @entity22			2
' mr @entity24 had called for an investigation to end the ' human trafficking of our tribal children in @entity6 '			0
' part of the reason for an investigation is the fact that i think we 've got women , primarily , who are in bad situations financially , maybe emotionally , maybe societal issues – whether that 's drug and alcohol issues or criminal issues – who are being selected , preyed upon , by these agencies , ' he said			0
' i think they prey upon people in dire straits			0
' in a statement , mr @entity27 said the @entity22 were aware of the plan for adoption before the birth and did not voice any objections			2
he acknowledged that the couple did leave @entity2 without obtaining an interstate compact agreement , which governs the placement of children from one state to another			2
' but they only did so under dire circumstances , ' mr @entity27 said in the statement			0
' any statements by the birth father or the @entity134 that the child was whisked out of @entity2 a couple of days after birth are patently false			1
' mr @entity27 said the couple went to family court in @entity6 where a temporary custody order was put in place			2
it 's unclear if the adoptive couple plan to appeal the @entity2 order , though mr @entity27 did write that the couple are trying to obtain an interstate compact agreement .			2

law on @entity1 adoptions says child must be placed with tribe first
couple had been present for birth before returning home with new baby
