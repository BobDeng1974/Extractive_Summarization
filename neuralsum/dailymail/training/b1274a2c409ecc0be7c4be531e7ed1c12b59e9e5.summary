in a victory for the gay rights movement , the @entity1 @entity0 decided monday that it will not hear appeals from five states seeking to prohibit same - sex marriages , paving the way for an expansion of unions between homosexuals			1
the decision does n't immediately fling open the courthouse doors to couples previously denied the right to marry , but makes it likely that earlier appeals court decisions will take effect as soon as judges lift the ' stays ' they ordered while the nation 's highest court examined the cases			1
there are still numerous gay - marriage court cases wending their way through lower courts , but the justices declined to immediately review decisions affecting couples only in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
it 's likely the @entity0 is waiting to get a fuller picture of how the nation 's judiciary views the contentious issue			0
the high court will likely weigh in only when two or more federal appeals courts disagree sharply on whether gay @entity1 should be able to tie the knot			1
all five of the cases before the nine justices were appeals from states affected by rulings that legalized the practice			0
the @entity73 - based @entity72 is the most likely one to put the issue on the @entity0 's plate			2
that district includes @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity32 : @entity82 , left , and @entity83 , right , get married by rev. @entity84 ( c ) at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity32 , yesterday @entity31 : @entity87 , left , and @entity88 , right , pose for photos with their marriage certificate and @entity92 judge @entity91 , centre @entity33 : @entity95 , 26 , left , and @entity96 , 26 , right , exchange vows during a ceremony , in front of the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity33 @entity30 : @entity101 , right , and his husband @entity102 , left , hug during a news conference at the @entity105 in @entity106 yesterday @entity34 : @entity107 , 23 , left , and @entity108 , 27 , right , both of @entity110 , @entity34 pictured in the @entity111 in @entity110 after applying for a marriage license with the @entity113 yesterday justice @entity114 told an audience three weeks ago at the @entity116 that ' there will be some urgency ' to decide the issue once and for all if judges on that court uphold gay - marriage bans			1
but she said then that if the appeals panel in @entity73 agrees with the cases that the @entity0 rejected on monday , there will be ' no need for us to rush			2
' a similar case sits in the traditionally liberal @entity130 , based in @entity131 , legal observers say there 's virtually no chance that court will side with those who advocate for a strictly traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman			0
celebrating : a wave of pro-gay - parriage decisions has made @entity141 like @entity142 and @entity143 ( left , @entity144 and @entity145 ( center ) and @entity147 and @entity148 ( right ) rejoice the gay rights movement has seen remarkably fast movement toward a new national standard that would prohibit government officials from distinguishing among between same - sex and traditional marriages @entity154 and her eight black - robed colleagues offered no comment monday in rejecting the only gay marriage appeals cases they had on their potential docket			2
the @entity161 reported monday that the court 's order immediately ends delays on marriage in the five affected states			0
but gay couples in six other states – @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity33 and @entity173 – will also be bound by the ruling since they are part of the same appeals - court districts			1
if it all shakes out according to gay - rights activists ' plans , there will shortly be 30 @entity1 states where the practice will be legal			0

high court declined to immediately review gay marriage bans in five states
decision leaves lower court rulings in place for now and will likely affect every – 11 in all – in federal court districts where monday 's cases *reside*
a sixth appeals court , based in @entity73 , @entity80 , could still buck the trend and uphold a ban
the @entity0 is likely waiting to act until there 's some disagreement at the federal appeals court level
one justice said last month that ' there will be some urgency ' to act if that happens
