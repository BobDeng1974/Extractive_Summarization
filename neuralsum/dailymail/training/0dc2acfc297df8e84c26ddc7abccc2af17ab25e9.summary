by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 15:17 est , 18 october 2013 when 6 - year - old @entity2 was discovered murdered in her basement in 1996 , many were quick to suspect her parents of carrying out the crime			1
as it turns out , a grand jury voted in 1999 voted to indict the young beauty - queen 's parents , @entity9 and @entity10 , but then - @entity13 , @entity12 district attorney @entity11 decided not to prosecute - a revelation first reported this year by the @entity15			1
but that evidence may soon be public record thanks to a judge who ruled yesterday that the indictment should be made public , unless the current @entity20 can make a compelling case for keeping them secret			1
the case remains unsolved current da @entity34 will make his case against releasing that indictment mid-week next week			1
his office has argued in the past that releasing the documents would constitute a ' beach of promise ' to the grand jurors			0
' the issue raised by the plaintiff 's request and the lawsuit are more important than any one case , ' said chief trial deputy @entity48			0
' every grand juror and every witness who appears before a grand jury , takes an oath of secrecy , and every witness and grand juror is promised that those involved in the process will honor that oath			0
' their decision : members of the grand jury are pictured in october 1999			2
they eventually voted in favor of indicting @entity9 and @entity10 no action : but the grand jury 's indictment was never prosecuted since then - district attorney @entity11 did n't believe he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the @entity68 and mrs @entity10 committed the crime but @entity71 judge @entity70 ruled yesterday that it would not be a breach of grand - jury privacy to release the document and instead said that it was in the public interest to see the thought process behind the @entity20 's decision			1
' this court agrees that transparency of a prosecutor 's decision not to proceed with an indictment from the grand jury is in the public interest , ' judge @entity80 wrote			2
' recognizing that the grand jury 's " indictment " is not requited to be supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt , but that the district attorney can not proceed with a prosecution unless he has a reasonable belief that he can obtain a conviction , the process followed in this case offered citizens no opportunity to consider the conflict between the decisions of the prosecutor and the grand jury			1
' so @entity102 will have to find another reason to keep them out of the public			0
then and now : then - district attorney @entity11 ( left ) decided not to act on the grand jury 's indictment			1
current @entity20 @entity34 ( right ) will argue to keep the indictment sealed next week ' this is a complicated legal issue , ' mr @entity34 said in a statement thursday			1
' my office is reviewing the court 's ruling very carefully and will make a determination how to respond by middle of next week			0
' the thursday ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed last month by @entity15 reporter @entity119 and a press advocacy group			2
they believe that the indictment is a criminal justice record that ' reflects official action ' by the grand jury and should be disclosed			2
the indictment and ensuing lawsuit are just the latest bend in the legal back - and - forth between the criminal justice system and the @entity131			0
gruesome discovery : @entity2 was found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her parent 's @entity13 , @entity12 home ( above ) ongoing case : @entity10 was a suspect in her daughter 's murder for the rest of the life			1
she died in 2006 from ovarian cancer no charges were ever actually filed against @entity9 or @entity143 , and the same goes for @entity2 's older brother @entity144 who allegedly slept through her kidnapping and subsequent murder in the family 's basement on december 26			0
mrs @entity10 died after a battle with ovarian cancer in 2006 and @entity9 has since remarried			0
in 2008 , following the testing of previously unknown dna found on @entity2 's underwear , the @entity151 formally ruled out any connection between @entity2 's immediate family members and the murder			0
a new district attorney reopened the case in 2009 , and it still remains open to this day			0
cleared : @entity9 and @entity143 were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 after the discovery of dna evidence on @entity2 's clothing christmas day , 1996 : parents of six - year - old @entity2 receive a ransom note demanding $ 118,000 @entity165 , 1996 : @entity2 found bludgeoned to death in the basement of her home in @entity13 , @entity12 @entity169 quickly placed her parents , @entity9 and @entity10 , under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' but they were never formally named as suspects detectives were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family 2003 : dna taken from the victim 's clothes suggests the family were not involved 2006 : @entity10 dies of ovarian cancer august 2006 : former teacher @entity2 reportedly confesses to the murder while being held on child pornography charges			1
but no murder charge brought after his @entity178 found not to match that on @entity2 's body 2008 : @entity13 district attorney 's office clears parents of any wrongdoing and issues apology february 2009 : @entity193 takes the case back from the district attorney to reopen the investigation			2

beauty - queen @entity2 , 6 , was found bludgeoned to death at her home on @entity165 , 1996
