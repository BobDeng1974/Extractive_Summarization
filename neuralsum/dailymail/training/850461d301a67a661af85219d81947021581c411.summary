by @entity0 published : 20:19 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 29 october 2013 how many @entity2 schools inspectors would approve of a half - naked teacher who instructed his pupils in the finer points of anarchic terrorism ? that was the approach taken by @entity8 , an @entity9 teacher at my old school , @entity10 , in the @entity12			1
mr @entity8 , who had done his @entity13 in @entity14 with the @entity15 , liked to teach outside , often stripped to his vest			0
privileged : @entity0 claims @entity19 , who attended @entity10 school in the 1980s , owes his success to his teachers , most of whom had no formal teaching qualification on sunny summer days , he marched the class to the boundary of the cricket pitch in nearby @entity28 , asking pupils to compose an instant essay on ‘ how cricket is like life ’			1
@entity8 was a @entity33 scholar , expert at guiding pupils towards @entity35 with his vast memory bank of quotes from @entity9 literature			0
at the same time , he told his pupils that all @entity35 colleges should be blown up , to end the wicked class divide			0
if @entity8 ’s old pupil , @entity19 , had his way , this maverick genius would n’t have been allowed to give 35 years of his life to inspiring @entity10 pupils			1
mr @entity8 studied classics and @entity9 at @entity47 , @entity48 , but he never got the formal teaching qualification @entity19 insists all teachers at free schools must have			1
barely any of the gifted teachers who taught me and @entity19 — i was four years below the deputy prime minister — had a teaching qualification			1
as a result , our elite education was blissfully free from the blunt , oafish , centralised government intervention @entity19 is demanding for less privileged children			1
@entity19 was n’t one of the more intelligent boys when he was at @entity63 from 1980 to 1985			2
' he was a genius who taught for the love of his subject ' the clever pupils at @entity10 — one of the best , and most expensive , schools in the country , costing £ 32,490 a year — were ‘ accelerated ’			2
that meant they did o - levels after two , as opposed to three , years			0
@entity19 , one of the less bright sparks , was selected for the three - year option			2
still , that did n’t stop him making it into @entity77 , @entity78 , in 1986 , and , from there , on to the smooth - running conveyor belt to life ’s glittering prizes : a scholarship at @entity84 , an ma at the @entity86 in @entity87 , a job with the @entity89 and a spell as an @entity91 , before becoming an mp			0
none of this would have been possible without the rocket - boosters attached to his middle - ranking talents by @entity10 ’s teachers			0
i was largely taught by the same teachers — they stayed at the school a long time , attracted by the freedom to teach in the way they wanted , not hamstrung by the foot - dragging , equality - obsessed , knowledge - hating forces of the state education machine			1
they taught for the love of their subject and were restricted neither by any national curriculum — which @entity19 is also insisting all free school teachers must follow — nor much of a school curriculum			1
that day ’s topic could be changed on the spot			0
@entity117 says new rules would drive free - thinking , inspirational teachers away from state schools and into private ones such as @entity10 ( pictured ) i remember the assassination of @entity123 , @entity124 ’s prime minister , in october 1984			1
i was 13 , in my first term , and our @entity9 teacher , @entity126 , decided on a whim to devote the lesson to studying her legacy rather than reading @entity132 , our o - level set book			0
of course , we ’d end up reading @entity132 and doing well in those exams , but only as a sideshow in the general mission to enjoy literature ; not as the be-all and end - all of the two years of lessons — or , in @entity19 ’s case , three years — leading to our o - levels			2
the teachers used a deft combination of carrot and stick			0
@entity146 — an @entity147 who taught physics to me and @entity19 and was rarely seen without his @entity151 tie — could be terrifying			2
but his lessons were wonderfully original			0
he taught the physics of heat transfer by telling us that , to warm up a cold bottle of red wine quickly before a dinner party , we must stick it behind the fridge — where warm air is expelled			0
in the same lesson that he taught us @entity163 ’s principle — which explains why aeroplanes fly — he also told us how to fold our jackets before putting them in a suitcase : turn one arm inside out , fold once vertically , then again horizontally			0
i still do it today on holiday — and i remember @entity163 ’s principle , too			0
@entity146 also had an uplifting disregard for petty rules			0
on a trip to a railway museum , he jumped into the cab of a stationary locomotive , beckoned a group of boys aboard , and headed , steaming , off into the sunset			0
' my other maths teacher , @entity181 , a planet - brained mathematician , tried to teach at a state school when he left @entity10 and was denied a job because he was n't ' qualified " ' my maths teacher , @entity184 , taught statistics by comparing the length of words used by the novelists @entity189 and @entity190 in 100 - word extracts from their books			1
tellingly , my other maths teacher , @entity181 , a planet - brained mathematician , later the headmaster , tried to teach at a state school when he left @entity10 — and was denied a job because he was n’t ‘ qualified ’			1
his old pupil , @entity19 , must have been delighted			2
he once bellowed at the young @entity198 , who took her a-levels at @entity10 : ‘ you ca n’t dress up as if you ’re about to go out and milk the cows ! ’ @entity203 , @entity19 ’s @entity204 teacher — last year awarded the @entity205 for ‘ great service rendered to @entity208 - @entity204 relations ’ — taught his subject through @entity204 poems set to music by @entity212 and @entity213			1
@entity203 was another ‘ untrained ’ but inspirational man who admitted that while at @entity48 , he ’d get one of the girls from @entity216 to check his translations which were always littered with ‘ howlers ’			0
of course , @entity10 in the @entity19 years was n’t a sepia - tinted paradise , with a common room entirely populated by adored mr chips types			2
as in any school , some of the teachers were n’t much good			2
free schools , like private schools , currently do n't require teachers to take a formal qualification before joining the staff and it helped that the pupils were from comfortable , middle - class backgrounds , often with book - lined drawing rooms at home			1
it helped , too , that practically all the teachers had been to @entity35			0
still , that does n’t mean less privileged children would n’t benefit from the teaching techniques that sent droves of @entity10 pupils to @entity35 and professional careers			2
wicked , patronising critics insist state schools ca n’t follow the same methods that make private schools the best in the world			1
' talented , free - thinking , unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones			1
' and @entity19 is n’t alone in denying poor children the advantages he benefited from by an accident of birth			2
shadow education secretary @entity257 — son of a peer , educated at fee - paying @entity259 and @entity260 — insists teachers must have qualifications , even though he has taught in schools in his @entity265 constituency without one himself			1
@entity19 and @entity257 come from a long line of privately educated , left - wing politicians , who pull up the drawbridge behind them			2
@entity269 , education secretary under @entity270 , was beautifully educated at @entity271 ’ @entity63 and @entity216 , @entity48 , but was determined to get rid of private and grammar schools			0
@entity275 ( @entity274 and @entity260 , @entity48 ) , @entity273 ’s @entity269 , famously said : ‘ if it ’s the last thing i do , i ’m going to destroy every f * * * ing grammar school in @entity9			0
’ who would n’t want to be free of their hypocritical grasp ? the idea behind @entity286 ’s free schools is they should be free , if not entirely independent , of the dead hand of @entity2			1
but @entity19 is trying to keep a @entity2 grip on them , keep them attached to what @entity286 calls ‘ the blob ’ — the immovable , stodgy mass of the state - education establishment			1
the result ? talented , free - thinking , unqualified teachers will desert free schools and flock to private ones			1
@entity10 ’s teachers were brilliant because they were free from state indoctrination , free from a @entity2 curriculum , free from the dim limitations of groupthink			1
@entity305 , too , to scream at , expel or suspend anyone they wanted			0
and they have n’t been on strike in 453 years			0
@entity0 is a tutor and teaches architectural history at a @entity310 art school			1
he does n’t have a teaching qualification .			0

@entity0 went to same private school as @entity19
says most teachers had no formal teaching qualifications
however they were inspirational and brought pupils success
@entity19 to force every teacher to have qualification including in free schools
@entity117 says this will drive maverick educators from state to private schools
