by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 02:30 est , 29 july 2013 mummy tummy : @entity2 of @entity3 leaving hospital on monday a senior minister has attacked the ‘ disgraceful focus ’ on the @entity10 ’s figure following the birth of @entity7			1
@entity11 , minister for women and equalities , said yesterday that observers were expecting @entity10 to meet ‘ impossible standards ’ to reduce her weight			1
she was reacting after ok ! magazine ’s front cover promoted the @entity20 ’s supposed post-natal weight - loss regime soon after she left hospital			2
other publications have followed suit			2
@entity10 was much lauded by organisations such as @entity25 for showing off her ‘ mummy tummy ’ on tuesday in a designer dress as she posed with day - old baby @entity27 for the first time			1
miss @entity11 , who is also expecting her first child , said discussion of @entity10 ’s weight ‘ shows just how extreme society ’s obsession with women ’s bodies looking “ perfect ” has become ’			1
the @entity37 minister said it was wrong to believe that @entity10 and other women who have just given birth were ‘ failing ’ if they did not work instantly to regain their pre-pregnancy figure			1
‘ @entity42 need to get some perspective , ’ she said			2
‘ fitting back into pre-pregnancy jeans is not the priority after childbirth			2
’ miss @entity11 , who has led a campaign in @entity49 to help women and girls improve their body image , warned that most women who have just given birth feel under huge pressure to regain their figures			1
‘ we need to move away from the idea that women have to shed their baby weight quickly and that they ’re failing somehow if they do n’t			1
surveys show this is a concern for two - thirds of new mothers , ’ she said			2
@entity64 declined to comment on the furore but a family friend described it as ‘ distasteful ’			2
‘ she was very fit and healthy before falling pregnant and i am sure she will snap back naturally but that just is n’t her priority at the moment , ’ said the friend			0
@entity10 , they said , was enjoying ‘ nesting ’ at her parents ’ home in @entity75 with @entity76 and @entity27			1
‘ they just want some quiet time getting to know each other as a family and learning how this parents thing works , ’ the source said			0
the friend also revealed that @entity10 ’s mother , @entity85 , was ‘ quietly rather worried ’ about having a new baby in the house			1
immediate pressure : magazines have already started discussing the @entity20 ' post-natal weight - loss only a week after she gave birth ‘ it has obviously been a few years since she has had to do any of this , ’ said the source			1
‘ like any grandparent she has been terrified at the thought of dropping him on his head			0
‘ fortunately she says it has all come flooding back			0
’ @entity76 and @entity10 have eschewed the services of a maternity nurse or nanny , but they have been accompanied by their housekeeper , @entity106 , who will run errands and prepare meals			1
while @entity64 will remain the @entity112 ’ main residence , they are already preparing to move into their new country bolthole			0
it is understood the @entity117 has paid the tenant of @entity119 in @entity120 a ‘ generous ’ settlement to vacate the property as soon as possible , four years before his lease is up			0
the ten - bedroom @entity126 property is situated on the monarch ’s @entity128 and is only two miles from @entity128 , one of her favourite residences			0
the @entity117 is currently on her annual summer holiday in the @entity134 and her new great - grandson was mentioned in prayers for the first time when the monarch attended @entity139 near @entity140 yesterday			0
all senior members of the @entity142 are named in the congregation ’s prayers each week			0
@entity7 should not grow up to be king of @entity146 , says the chairman of the campaign for @entity146 independence			0
@entity150 , of @entity151 , said an independent nation should be given a vote to decide whether it wanted to retain the monarchy or elect a head of state			0
‘ personally , i favour the latter , ’ he said .			0

minister @entity11 *condemned* pressure on @entity10 to lose weight
