by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 18 january 2013 a former solicitor who put an antique @entity3 vase up for auction two years ago has only just managed to sell the piece after a lengthy legal row over the auctioneers ' fees			1
@entity9 and his mother @entity11 believed they had sold the rare piece , which they had inherited from an relative , for the ' stratospheric ' sum of £ 43million in 2010			1
but the @entity3 billionaire buyer is believed to have balked at paying an extra 20 per cent in auctioneers fees on top of his winning bid			1
new home : this rare 18th century @entity23 vase has finally sold for £ 25million after a two year legal battle over its sale at auction @entity27 , who owns the @entity29 auction house that ' sold ' the exquisite vase , spent months trying to save the deal by negotiating with the buyer but with no success			1
after a two year stalemate , a new unidentified buyer from the @entity35 put in a new offer through @entity39 auction house and is now believed to have paid up to £ 25million for the 18th century @entity23 vase			1
it is thought the bulk of the money has gone to the @entity9 family although mr @entity27 would have been ' significantly ' compensated			2
@entity45 , a spokesman for @entity39 , said : ' we are pleased to confirm the sale of the vase for an undisclosed sum , in a private treaty deal			2
' a @entity3 table screen priced at just £ 150 has stunned experts at auction when it sold for £ 34,300			1
the blue and white porcelain screen turned heads at the sale at @entity58 's @entity57 in @entity59 , @entity60 , when fierce bidding from the @entity62 and overseas meant the price quickly soared			0
the 2ft - high porcelain table screen , painted with a mountain scene and intended purely for decorational purposes , was painted by the renowned @entity3 ceramic artist @entity67			2
the son of @entity69 , @entity67 became a popular porcelain painter during the reigns of @entity72 and @entity73 , and started an apprenticeship in @entity75 , @entity3 , at the age of nine , after following in his father 's footsteps			2
he eventually earned the title of ' @entity80 ' - which translates as ' @entity81 '			0
his work is now held in various key museums and is much sought after by collectors around the world			0
this lot , pictured right and below next to auctioneer @entity88 , was bagged by a @entity90 buyer for £ 34,300 , and after a buyer 's premium of 15 per cent was added , the final price came in at £ 39,445 - more than 250 times the guide price			2
the 16ins porcelain vase was made for the @entity3 emperor @entity23 , who ruled between 1736 to 1795			1
it was looted from the @entity97 during the infamous raids by the @entity62 and the @entity99 in 1860			0
mr @entity9 , 56 , from the @entity100 , and his elderly mother inherited it from her late sister , @entity103 , in january 2010			1
it had once belonged to mrs @entity103 's late husband who had in turn inherited it from an uncle who brought it back from @entity3			2
mr @entity9 believed it could be valuable and contacted @entity112 auctioneers in @entity113 , @entity114			0
the object attracted massive interest from @entity3 bidders at the auction in november 2010 and it sold for 40 times its estimate before the dispute erupted			1
@entity121 , editor of the @entity122 , said the deal that has now been reached was the best result for everybody concerned			0
he said : ' from what i understand @entity27 did everything possible to try and negotiate with the original buyer			0
' but he could not have budged on the 20 per cent buyer 's premium otherwise he could have been exposed to a legal case by the under - bidder			1
' if an item fails to sale at auction , under contract the auctioneer normally reserves the right to offer it for sale again			0
' but mr @entity29 could n't re-sell it as the piece had been spoilt and tainted by what had happened			0
' the private deal that has now been struck is as good an outcome as the vendor and mr @entity29 could have hoped for			0
' the private treaty was brokered through @entity39 in @entity149 and @entity150 , their head of @entity152 art , is the biggest cheese there is in the world at @entity152 art. ' from what i can gather @entity27 has been compensated			0
it must have been a significant amount of money for him to release the vase to @entity39			0
' the price of between £ 20million to £ 25million is a fair price			1
the vendor would have walked away with a good chunk of that and @entity39 would have got a decent fee out of it as well			0
' mr @entity121 said the vase was one of the finest pieces ever made in @entity3			2
he added : ' last year there was an exhibition in @entity172 of great historical @entity3 objects and a similar vase was listed as being in the top dozen items in @entity3 art history and that was n't as good as this one			1

18th century @entity23 vase originally sold at auction for £ 43million in 2010
but @entity3 buyer *refused* to pay the 20 *%* fees of @entity29 auction house
sale of the vase - which was inherited by solicitor @entity9 - was stuck in two year legal battle
new bidder has now purchased the antique - but for just £ 25million
