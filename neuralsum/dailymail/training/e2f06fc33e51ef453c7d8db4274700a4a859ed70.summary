she took me off hold and said unfortunately she would not be able to schedule an appointment for us because they currently do not service same sex couples and it 's just not something they do			2

' homophobic bigots , spend your money with a company that has open hearts and minds ! they turned away a couple just because they happen to be lesbians			0
they probably have an issue with interracial marriage as well			0
love is about hearts , not parts ! ' writes @entity85 ' bigotry at its finest , if you 're divorced , not a virgin , talked back to your parents , @entity90 , of another religion e.t.c			0

@entity40 will bless you greatly for staying true to his word			0
