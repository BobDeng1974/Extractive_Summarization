it was a beautiful sunny morning for the @entity2 family as they sat by the pool in their @entity6 hotel on @entity8 in 2004			1
@entity2 and her two boys , from @entity10 , @entity11 , were oblivious to the horror that was about to unfold as the devastating tsunami hit the popular @entity15 island			1
ms @entity2 recalls playing with @entity16 , five , and @entity17 , two , as the first wave hit , before she was faced with a decision no mother should have to make - which of her two sons she should save			1
her husband had momentarily gone back to the room to get a spare pair of swimmers			2
' i remember hearing what sounded like jet planes so i looked up at the sky and did n't see anything so i thought that was quite weird , ' she told @entity46			0
' at that point i also saw all these birds flying away and thought that was weird too			0
there were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck @entity15 - 26 of which were @entity55			1
a decade on , commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster			0
the tsunami , triggered by a 9.1 - magnitude earthquake , hit just off the west coast of @entity62 , @entity63 and struck coastal communities across the @entity65			1
it left about 230,000 people dead and caused about $ 10 billion in damage			2
when the disaster struck @entity55 pledged $ 1 billion in humanitarian funds and played a key role helping with the overwhelming task of identifying thousands of victims			2
' then these two security guards ran past us and were on their walkie talkies which is when i looked up and saw this enormous amount of water coming towards us at a very fast pace			1
' she grabbed her two - year - old and yelled at @entity16 to run for his life			1
' i had @entity17 in my arm and grabbed @entity16 's hand and i never looked back , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' i remember getting into the hotel lobby , trying to get up on the breakfast bar but it was too full			0
' i was yelling for help and then i saw this teenage girl , @entity92 , and she put out her hand which is when i let go of @entity16 because i thought he would be okay with her			1
' i knew we would all die if i did n't let go of one of the boys			0
i just would n't have had anything to fight the water			0
' that was the moment she let go of @entity16 , hoping he would survive , as she got pulled under the water while she held onto @entity17			1
' at one point i thought i was underwater forever , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' but every now and then when i got up above the water i could hear @entity17 screaming - so i knew he was still alive			1
' @entity2 ( pictured ) was holding @entity17 ( front ) in her arms as she got swept up in the tsunami			1
she was holding @entity16 's hand but had to let go a man surrounded by the damage caused by the tsumani at @entity112 in @entity6 - the island the @entity108 were on at the time in 2004 parts of @entity63 were destroyed by the tsunami on @entity8 an image which captures the moment people fled from a tidal wave approaching the coast in @entity6 once she found safety , ms @entity2 waded through the water in desperate search for @entity16			1
' i saw @entity92 and i asked where he was and she said she had to let go because they were getting pulled out by the water again , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' when she told me that i just screamed			0
' but there was n't much time for ms @entity2 to grieve as she was alerted of a second tsunami that was on its way			1
' i could hear whistles blowing and people were yelling that the next wave was coming soon , ' she said			0
she was rushed to higher ground where she met her husband and told him the devastating news			0
' i told my husband at the time that i 'd lost @entity16 , ' ms @entity2 said			1
' @entity32 just took off and i did n't see him for awhile because he went looking for our son			0
' once the worst had surpassed , everyone was taken up to the roof of the hotel where ms @entity2 had to play the painful waiting game			1
' when i finally saw @entity32 up on the roof he told me that he could n't find @entity16 and i just lost it , ' she said			2
i started to feel bad and there was so much guilt			0
' i had all sorts of things going through my mind - like bringing back @entity16 's body bag and packing up his bedroom back at home			1
i was n't sure how i would get through his birthdays and the @entity159 without him			0
' for @entity16 , who 's now 15 , the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain mum @entity2 is grateful each year to spend @entity24 with her boys @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) @entity17 , now 11 , is also lucky to be alive after being pulled under water several times during the tsunami an hour had passed and @entity16 was still missing			1
ms @entity2 was convinced she would never see her son again			1
' i thought he was dead			0
@entity16 could n't swim , ' she said			2
' so by that point everyone knew i 'd lost @entity16 but then someone said : " hey is n't that the @entity16 who 's been missing ? "			1
' i opened my eyes and tried to wipe away my tears because everything was so blurry that i could n't see			0
but then i saw a blue rashie - one that @entity16 wore - and i just knew it was him			2
' i just could n't believe he was there , right in front of me			0
' he did n't even have a scratch on him			0
he was perfect and was found by some security guards			1
and the first thing he said to me was " mummy i 'm really dirty , i need a shower "			0
' i felt really lucky			0
it obviously was n't our time and somebody was watching over us			0
' @entity190 - that 's one word to describe it			2
' a woman offers prayers on a tiled memorial wall in @entity15 displaying names of victims from the @entity8 tsunami that left more than 230,000 people dead in 14 countries family members of victims stand in silent memory after placing flowers into the sea in @entity15 although @entity16 , who 's now 15 , does n't remember much of the day he remembers hanging onto a door for a couple of hours			1
' i do n't know how i survived but i guess when you 're in survival mode and that strong mentality , you really do n't know your own strengths , ' he told @entity46			0
' i did n't even know what a tsunami was			0
i just knew it was this big wave that wiped out everything			0
' in hindsight , @entity16 says his mum made the right decision in letting him go			1
' my brother was younger and had no chance of survival , ' he said			0
' i knew it had to be done and i think mum made a smart decision			2
' while the @entity108 were the lucky few who lived to tell their tales of survival , there were more than 5,000 people killed in the tsunami that struck @entity15 - 26 of which were @entity55			1
a decade on , commemorations have begun for the thousands of lives lost during the disaster			0

it left about 230,000 people dead			0
but since the terrifying ordeal , @entity16 and his family have n't been able to go back to @entity15			1
' i think i 'd like to go one day for a bit of closure but i just would n't put the boys through that at the moment , ' ms @entity2 said			1
for @entity16 , the fear and the memories of his nightmare holiday still remain			2
' maybe i 'll go when i 'm a bit older but i would n't like to go now , ' @entity16 said			2
