a pair of mysterious bright spots on the asteroid @entity3 could be towering ' water volcanoes ' , scientists claim			1
recent images from the @entity7 spacecraft reveal the spots , dubbed ' feature number 5 ' , at various angles as the asteroid rotates			1
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of @entity3 , suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater , as previously believed			1
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of @entity3 , suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface ' what is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight , ' said @entity36 , a planetary scientist at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			1
he noted that at dawn on @entity3 , the spots shine brightly , but fade as dusk draws in			2
according to @entity44 , this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by , for instance , heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume			2
scientists have speculated that the interior of @entity3 is rocky with a layer of water and ice			1
the leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge ' cryovolcanoes ' due to internal pressure in the asteroid			1
@entity3 continues to baffle astronomers as @entity7 orbits the dwarf planet			1
this image was taken by the @entity7 spacecraft of dwarf planet @entity3 on february 19 from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles ( 46,000 km )			1
it shows that the brightest spot on @entity3 has a dimmer companion , which apparently lies in the same basin @entity7 observed @entity3 completing one full rotation , which lasted about nine hours			1
the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at @entity3 ' surface : from shallow , flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers @entity3 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity3 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			2
scientists think @entity3 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity99 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
the @entity7 spacecraft pulled into orbit earlier this month around the @entity3 in the asteroid belt			1
the probe is currently on the dark side of @entity3 and wo n't emerge until april			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity3 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals			1
while @entity21 has not provided an explanation , scientists previously said these spots may be frozen pools of ice at the bottom of a crater that reflect light			0
the @entity7 spacecraft pulled into orbit earlier this month around the @entity3 in the asteroid belt			1
the probe is currently on the dark side of @entity3 and wo n't emerge until april			0
for now , the team say they need higher resolution images of the ' alien ' spots to reveal its true nature			2
' it could be quite interesting , ' @entity7 lead scientist @entity134 , with the @entity135 , @entity136 told @entity138			0
' i believe we 'll show @entity3 is every bit a planet as its terrestrial neighbors @entity143 , @entity99 , @entity144 and @entity145 , ' @entity134 said			0
as scientists receive better views of the dwarf planet over the next few months , they hope to gain a deeper understanding of its origin and evolution by studying its surface			0
the intriguing bright spots and other interesting features of this captivating world will come into sharper focus			0
' the brightest spot continues to be too small to resolve with our camera , but despite its size it is brighter than anything else on @entity3 , ' said @entity36 , lead investigator for the framing camera team at the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39			0
@entity7 has been steadily returning stunning animations of @entity3			1
' we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity3			0
' now , @entity7 is ready to change that , ' said @entity173 , @entity7 's chief engineer and mission director , based at @entity21 's @entity175 in @entity176			0
the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the @entity7 hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 @entity3 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			1
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			0
the long exposure made @entity3 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity3 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity7 will be captured into @entity3 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity3 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			1
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			0
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity7 mission director and chief engineer @entity173 , of @entity21 's @entity175 in @entity207 , @entity176 said			0
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity3 has held since the dawn of the solar system			2
' @entity3 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity143 and @entity218 and is very similar to @entity218 's @entity219 and @entity221 's @entity220 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			2
the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity3 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity99 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity218			0
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity99 and @entity240 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity99			0
@entity3 is twice the size of @entity221 's geyser - spouting moon @entity242 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			2
it lies less than three times as far as @entity99 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity7 has already visited @entity253 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity3			1
the distance between @entity253 and @entity3 is greater than the distance between the @entity99 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity253 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			1
@entity253 and @entity3 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			2
@entity3 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			0
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface			0

images from @entity7 reveal the spots , dubbed ' feature number 5 ' , at various angles as the asteroid rotates
spots are visible when they are near edge of @entity3 , suggesting that they must be high above the surface
leading theory is that ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that can explode due to pressure in the asteroid
