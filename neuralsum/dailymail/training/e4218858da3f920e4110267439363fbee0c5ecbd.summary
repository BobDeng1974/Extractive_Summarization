cockpit camera footage of @entity2 's doomed space flight shows pilot @entity3 breaking out in a panic after realising a deadly mistake has been made by activating the ship 's wings			1
in the footage , he appears to realise pulling a lever activating the wings is a mistake before desperately attempting to rectify it by switching off the engines - seconds before the ship disintegrates			1
the revelation he recognized there was an error comes as the former president of @entity2 stated the crash was caused by nothing ' other than pilot error '			1
investigators have stated the spacecraft 's ' feathering ' system - which rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed			0
cockpit footage taken in the seconds leading up to the disaster shows mr @entity3 pushing the lever to unhook the wings at 30 seconds past 10.07am , @entity47 reported			1
panic sets in as he instantly realises his mistake and desperately attempts to turn the engine off			1
this is unsuccessful - the wings begin to deploy only four seconds later - and at that point the video , and all other data , is lost			0
@entity59 , former president of @entity2 , said it looked likely the crash was due to pilot error former @entity2 president @entity59 told the paper : ' there 's nothing that tells me that this was anything other than pilot error , sadly			1
' i think he just unlocked at a time he should n't have			0
' the [ @entity29 ] are trying to understand why he did that , was there something in the system that told him he should do it , or did he just make a mistake , and i think it 's going to be the latter			2
' a @entity2 spokesperson declined to comment on the contents of the footage			1
meanwhile federal investigators who have been in the @entity26 trying to find out why the experimental spaceship crashed are wrapping up their work in @entity83			0
@entity29 spokesman @entity84 said that yesterday , investigators left the area about 120 miles north of @entity87 where @entity25 broke apart on october 31			0
the safety board will take months more to finish interviews and analysis of physical evidence before publicly stating what it thinks caused the crash			0
authorities say mr @entity3 unlocked the system before planned , but this was one of two steps necessary to change the craft 's configuration and was not enough on its own to do so			1
activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever , not unlike a gun that fires only when the trigger is pulled , not just because the safety has been disengaged			2
but unlocking the system may have set off a chain of events that led to disintegration of the craft			0
@entity2 is building a replacement spaceship and says test flights could resume as early as next summer if it finishes building a replacement craft			2
the sleek composite shell and tail section of the new craft are sitting inside the company 's manufacturing facility in @entity26 , @entity83			0
after more than two years of work , it 's beginning to look like a spaceship , but @entity2 ceo @entity124 said there 's much more to be done , from relatively simple things such as installing windows to the more complex fitting of flight controls and other wiring .			2
