as a qualified plumber , @entity0 is ready to throw the kitchen sink at the @entity3 this weekend			1
the scrum - half is also keen to patch up any leaks in the @entity7 defence as he prepares to take on a @entity3 side he claims are ‘ there to be taken ’			1
it is a bold statement from the 25 - year - old half - back , particularly given the fact his country have failed to beat the @entity16 giants since 1953			1
but @entity17 are hoping to catch the @entity18 cold in their final game of the season , just as @entity21 did in 2012			2
@entity0 is high on confidence after displacing long - term favourite @entity23 from the @entity7 line - up and , having seen the @entity3 run close by @entity25 and @entity26 , believes @entity17 have the key to unlock their interminable dominance			1
@entity17 scrum half @entity0 is looking forward to the clash with the @entity3 in @entity31 on saturday ‘ they ’re a world - class team who are top of the rankings at the moment , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but i think they are there to be taken			2
‘ @entity26 nearly pipped them and @entity25 put in a real tough performance against them			2
you ’ve got to be physical			2
they ’ve been getting a bit flustered when people have been going at them			2
i think if we can play our game plan , not take a backward step and really get into them then we can put on a good show			0
’ having spent the early stages of his @entity53 career playing second fiddle to 81 - cap all black scrum - half @entity57 , @entity0 is familiar with the @entity59 ways			1
on saturday he is expected to face 37 - capper @entity60 and hopes that @entity57 ’s teachings will work in his favour at the @entity64			1
@entity0 is high on confidence after displacing long - term favourite @entity23 from the @entity7 line - up ‘ at the @entity53 , learning off @entity57 was very special , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ just the way he controls the game and his running side of the game as well			0
it ’s not all about passing , passing , passing but the way he likes to take on defenders as well			0
' obviously he was really good at closing out games			0
he could slow it down at vital times and keep an eye on the scoreboard and clock ; managing the boys around him			0
’ as well as working in the shadows of @entity57 , @entity0 has also been following in the footsteps of an impressive @entity84 alumnus			1
@entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 are all former students from the @entity90 school , with the latter now in charge of the @entity7 back - line			0
@entity0 will face @entity3 's star number nine @entity60 at the @entity64 showdown @entity87 made 59 appearances in the red jersey and now works closely with @entity0 in his role as assistant to @entity100			1
both @entity87 and @entity100 see the half - back combination of @entity0 and @entity102 as the best option to take @entity17 through to the @entity104 , particularly given their impressive form for the @entity53			1
the @entity107 pair have developed an understanding at club level and are the latest half - back ‘ unit ’ to play together for their country			2
the pair have followed the likes of @entity115 and @entity116 ( @entity117 and @entity26 ) , @entity118 and @entity119 ( @entity120 and @entity26 ) and @entity121 and @entity122 ( @entity123 and @entity124 )			0
‘ we know each other inside out - the different options we have and knowing where he is , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ ' as a nine you need to know where the 10 is at all times and he ’s obviously really vocal as well , which helps nine			0
he does n’t shut up but that ’s good for a nine , for directing forwards around us			0
he ’s a really confident player as well - he ’s full of confidence at the moment , which is good for @entity17			0
hopefully he can run a good show for @entity17			0
’ @entity0 cites 81 - cap @entity3 scrum - half @entity57 as a huge influence during his time at the @entity53 @entity0 endured a mixed afternoon in the opening defeat to @entity26			1
he scored the opening try with a characteristic snipe from the breakdown , but was then caught out by @entity146 , who intercepted his pass for an 80 - metre run in			0
such moments of naivety will be punished against the @entity3 but @entity0 is no longer the one in the shadows			1
the shirt is his to lose and a solid performance on saturday will surely see his stronghold through to the final test against @entity124 next week			2
‘ i know when you play in that jersey , it ’s not permanent , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve been enjoying my rugby this year so i think that ’s helped in selection			0
you need to put on a real performance to keep hold of the jersey but it means a lot to wear it this weekend against one of the best sides in the world			0
i remember watching @entity170 scoring tries and running over people			0
it ’s a dream come true			0
