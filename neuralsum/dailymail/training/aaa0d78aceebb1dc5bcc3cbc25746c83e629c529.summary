@entity1 's family , from @entity2 , have lost a @entity4 appeal to sue two police forces over her murder in 2009 the family of a young mother who was stabbed to death by her jealous ex-boyfriend after a 999 blunder say they are ' shocked ' by a @entity4 ruling which means they can not sue police for negligence			1
@entity1 , 25 , from @entity2 , phoned the police twice in fear of her life before being knifed 72 times by her 19 - year - old boyfriend @entity21 in 2009			1
now the @entity23 family has been told they can not sue the two police forces involved , despite a police watchdog ruling that the young mother was failed by @entity27 and @entity29 police			1
but the supreme court ruled the family can still attempt to bring a claim under @entity34 human rights laws - a move which officers had tried to block by relying on a precedent from the @entity39 case			1
speaking after the landmark ruling , ms @entity1 's mother @entity40 said police ' could and should ' have done more to protect her ' beautiful ' daughter from the ' savage murder '			1
she said : ' i have lost a wonderful daughter and her children have lost a loving mother and provider			2
' i have brought this case to secure damages for the children and also to make police answerable for their failures to deal effectively with a serious domestic case			2
' i am shocked that five of the seven court judges found that the police were not negligent			2
i take some comfort that the appeal may bring this problem to the attention of the nation			2
' the ruling , which has given both hope and disappointment to domestic violence campaigners , is another step in what has become a long legal battle for the family			0
they first won the right to try to bring a claim against both forces in 2011 , but their case was thrown out by the @entity78 last year			1
judges had ruled that , under common law , police have immunity from being sued for negligence for their actions during ' the investigation or suppression of crime '			0
that decision was upheld today in the @entity4 with a 5 - 2 majority , when judges rejected the claim that police owe a duty of care in negligence where they are aware or reasonably aware of a threat to the life or physical safety of a person			1
the family had launched the legal action after ' individual and systemic failures ' meant the emergency services arrived too late to save ms @entity1 's life , despite her frantically phoning 999 twice in just 15 minutes			1
@entity107 , appearing for ms @entity1 's family , told the @entity4 the case was ' desperately important ' , particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence			2
he told the panel : ' there is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services			0
' during the hearing , mr @entity122 described how @entity21 had broken into the young mother 's home ' in a mad fit of jealous rage ' after he discovered she was in a new relationship			2
there had been a history of domestic abuse , it later emerged			0
the court heard how ms @entity1 had made her first 999 call on a mobile phone to the police at 2.29am on august 5 2009			1
she told the @entity139 operator that @entity21 had come to the house and found her with someone else			2
he had then bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car , saying he would return later to kill her			0
the mother - of - two , 25 , ( left ) phoned the police twice before being killed in a frenzied attack by her 19 - year - old boyfriend @entity21 ( right ) mr @entity122 said the ' urgency was absolutely plain ' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes			1
but the call went through @entity29 - ' the wrong police force ' - and not @entity27 , as it should have done			1
the @entity29 operator then told ms @entity1 to ' stay put ' in the house and keep the phone free so @entity158 could phone her back , said mr @entity122			0
according to the appeal court judgment , the operator spoke to @entity158 and said @entity21 had threatened to return to ' hit ' ms @entity1 but did not refer to ' the threat to kill '			1
it meant the call , which should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response , was instead graded at the next level down			2
at 2.43am , a further 999 call was received by @entity139 from ms @entity1			1
in that phone call , she could be heard screaming before the line went dead			0
a court heard how ' individual and systemic failures ' meant the emergency services arrived too late to @entity23 's life police officers arrived at ms @entity1 's home six minutes later , at 2.51am			1
she was found to have been stabbed by @entity21 72 times			1
@entity21 pleaded guilty to murdering his former girlfriend and was jailed in for life in 2010 , with a minimum 20 - year tariff			1
mr @entity122 told the court that the ' factual picture ' revealed there were ' crucial legal duties owed to ms @entity1 's estate by the police '			1
he argued that officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays			0
these were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence , he said			0
her family has been trying since 2011 to win their right to sue @entity27 and @entity29 police separately , the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) previously ruled that ms @entity1 was failed by @entity27 and @entity139			1
they criticised both police forces for individual and organisational failures			0
mr @entity122 added that police were claiming immunity from being sued , largely relying on the 1989 case of @entity207 chief constable of @entity208 - the ' @entity39 ' case			0
all seven justices unanimously dismissed the cross-appeal by the chief constables of @entity27 and @entity139 to block the family 's right to claim under @entity215 of the @entity216 , the @entity217			1
finally , five members of the @entity4 panel dismissed the family 's case			0
the two dissenting judgments in favour of allowing the appeal coming from @entity225 and @entity226			0
but dissenting judge @entity226 said : ' if the police force had not negligently downgraded the urgency of ms @entity1 's call , on the facts as they are known at present , it is probable that she would still be alive			1
' the anti-domestic violence campaign group @entity233 , which had intervened in the case , said it was ' deeply disappointed ' that the panel majority had decided the police could not be held liable for negligence			0
it is calling for a public inquiry into the way in which the police and other statutory agencies in the @entity244 respond to victims of domestic violence			0
but the group said it was ' encouraged ' by the unanimous @entity4 finding that the @entity23 family was entitled to pursue its @entity250 human rights claim against the police , saying that should give hope to ' hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims '			1
chief executive @entity256 sd : ; @entity1 , the mother of two young children , died a needless death			2
no court ruling will change that			0
just like hundreds of other victims of domestic violence @entity264 was failed by the police when she reached out for help			0
' she added : ' we are delighted that @entity264 's family may now , at least , progress one step further down the long path to justice and that their @entity250 claim , seeking a declaration and compensation from the state , may now proceed			2
' this judgment has wider , positive , implications for abused women and children			0
it secures a small increase in police accountability and widens a previously very narrow doorway to justice for hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims			0
' @entity289 's lawyer @entity288 said : ' @entity298 and time again , police are failing victims of domestic violence - but , thanks to these archaic rules , even the most breath - taking police negligence goes unchallenged			2
' @entity299 , solicitor for both @entity233 and @entity289 , said : ' the fight to achieve equal protection from the law for women facing domestic violence will continue , inside and outside the courts			0
' this case was an important step in that fight			0
the highest court in the land has had to address and acknowledge the stark reality of police failings in relation to domestic violence			1
though part of the battle in this case was lost , the rest of the case proceeds			0
that is an important victory in itself			0

mother - of - two @entity1 was stabbed 72 times by boyfriend in 2009
25 - year - old from @entity2 rang 999 twice before @entity21 , 19 , killed her
call should have had immediate response , but was graded at lower level
police watchdog ruled she was failed by @entity27 and @entity139
her parents and children tried to bring damages claim against both forces
highest court has now upheld @entity78 's decision to refuse right
but it said family can still make a claim under @entity34 human rights laws
mother @entity40 said she was ' shocked ' but hopes ruling will bring problem ' to attention of the nation '
