when the @entity2 ascended to the throne in 1952 , the latest thing in ship design was the @entity5 's @entity4 , a 1,500 - passenger vessel built by @entity7 at its yard in @entity9			1
the excellent @entity11 website offers fascinating glimpses of life on board - all tea dances and cucumber sandwiches			0
what a change there is today			0
the bow of @entity20 carries a huge stylised @entity21 , which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device , but broadcasts a @entity24 heritage which has been brought bang up to date you feel that the latest @entity11 vessel @entity20 , which the @entity2 officially named last monday in @entity27 , could fit the @entity28 on to one deck			1
however , they are not just vessels from different eras - they come from wholly dissimilar philosophies			0
@entity4 was built primarily to get passengers from @entity36 to @entity37 - fun was considered to be a fancy dress party or the odd beetle drive			1
@entity20 has been purposefully built for enjoyment			1
it is an entertainment monster , bristling with fun on almost every deck			0
it is , to borrow a line from poetry , a stately pleasure dome			0
it 's customary to bemoan the compromised standards of the modern era , to yearn for the sturdier certainties of times past			0
cruising , at least , is one area where newer almost always means better			0
@entity56 may be part of the @entity59 carnival corporation these days but , happily , it remains @entity24 to the tips of its mastheads			0
the bow of @entity20 carries a huge stylised @entity21 , which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device , but broadcasts a @entity24 heritage which has been brought bang up to date			1
the ambassadors for modern @entity56 are chefs such as @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 because it is in the area of food , strangely enough , in which the @entity24 has begun to lead the world			1
another area where we set the standard is in hotels : the international success of @entity79 and his @entity81 group has ushered in a new era of laid - back elegance			1
it is this very style that @entity20 has captured so impressively			2
the modern era of @entity24 cruising , which @entity56 began with the @entity87 more than 20 years ago , has now achieved an apotheosis with @entity20			2
for those poor holiday limpets who will not consider cruising because they refuse to acknowledge the emergence of what is arguably the purest form of holidaymaking , i have one piece of advice : be ruled by @entity20 because @entity20 really does rule the waves .			2

@entity20 has been purposefully built for enjoyment
chefs @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 are ambassadors
@entity79 and his @entity103 *responsible* for laid - back elegance
