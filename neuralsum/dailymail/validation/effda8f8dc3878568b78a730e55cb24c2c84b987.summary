@entity1 president @entity0 said @entity3 's plans were ' mission impossible ' @entity3 's hopes of winning sweeping changes to @entity11 's relationship with @entity12 are ' mission impossible ' , the top @entity6 politician who will run the negotiations has said			1
@entity0 , the president of the @entity16 council representing @entity6 leaders , said he was ' ready to help @entity3 ' – but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new @entity16 treaty within the next two years before holding an @entity6 referendum			1
the former @entity22 prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 @entity6 leaders that would satisfy mr @entity3			1
he said : ' i have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework			0
we have to help @entity3 because he is obviously pro-european			2
but mr @entity0 added : ' i am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty			1
' mr @entity3 wants a new @entity12 treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing @entity11 to limit benefits for @entity6 migrants			1
the pm has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis - hit @entity39 , giving @entity11 the chance to renegotiate its relationship with @entity12			1
but mr @entity0 said : ' my intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it 's not only about rationality , about good argument			2
' we need unanimity between 28 member states , in the @entity16 parliament , in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification			0
to say that it is a @entity56 is too little			0
' mr @entity0 said : ' first of all we need more precise concrete [ details ] about @entity60 demands			2
' when we have more information about details , about legal problems , then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary			0
' for me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question			0
it 's not only about the arguments of @entity3			2
i can agree or disagree with some of them			0
' but at the end of the day i would like to ask him ' what is your concrete proposal ? ' and then i can consult with the other member states			0
' mr @entity0 , the former @entity22 prime minister likened @entity3 's chances of negotiating a new @entity6 treaty by 2017 to the @entity83 blockbusters ' @entity81 ' but he said : ' we need , also for the @entity60 , a good solution for @entity3 and @entity11 under existing law , ' he said			1
' we need the @entity60 in @entity16			0
for me there 's no more obvious political thesis than this one			0
and i feel , but it 's not my role to decide about it , but i feel that the @entity60 needs @entity16			0
' the former @entity22 prime minister 's remarks are the first since he took over as european council president in december			1
he also admitted , in an interview with the @entity96 , that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration – because of the number of @entity22 living and working abroad			2
he said : ' it 's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems , which means also the huge @entity22 minority in @entity11			1

@entity0 said it will be hard to win agreement of all 27 @entity6 leaders
@entity1 president 's remarks are first since taking office last year
former @entity22 prime minister said he was ' sceptical ' of @entity3 's chances
