by @entity0 published : 02:20 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 02:20 est , 1 may 2013 an ' excellent and caring mother ' who put her three - year - old daughter on the wrong sort of booster seat was partly responsible for the horrific injuries the toddler suffered in a road smash , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity9 suffered brain and spinal injuries when her mother @entity12 was hit in august 2006			1
the child had been placed on a seat designed for older , taller children			1
a judge ruled @entity17 was partially responsible for her daughter @entity18 's injuries in a car crash that was not her fault because she placed her in a seat designed for an older child ( file picture ) @entity25 , 18 , was high on drink and drugs , when he swerved onto the wrong side of the road and hit mrs @entity9 's car on the @entity31 , near @entity32			1
he died of his injuries			0
@entity34 said there was no doubt the accident was entirely caused by his ' extremely dangerous ' driving but said mrs @entity9 bore 25 per cent responsibility for her daughter 's injuries , because she had put her on a booster cushion designed for a four - year - old			1
the judge emphasised that mrs @entity9 was in no way to blame for the smash and described her as ' an excellent and caring mother whose daughter 's safety was naturally of paramount importance to her '			2
but she went on to rule that , although her ' conduct was similar to thousands of other parents ' and no law had been broken , the mother had been negligent in not placing @entity18 in a five - point ' @entity57 ' baby harness that was also in the family car			0
a high court judge ruled last year that , although the teenager driver 's insurers had admitted primary liability for @entity18 's injuries , mrs @entity9 , of @entity64 , near @entity65 , @entity66 , could not escape partial responsibility for the tragedy			1
@entity34 , sitting at @entity70 's @entity69 , dismissed her appeal against that ruling			0
she said that while @entity18 , at 15kg , was heavy enough for the booster cushion , she was eight centimetres too short for it			0
@entity18 was also 10 months short of her fourth birthday , the minimum age recommended by the manufacturers			0
although @entity18 seemed ' comfortable and secure ' on the cushion , the instruction booklet that came with it ' contained clear and repeated warnings ' that a failure to use it correctly could result in serious injury or death , added the judge			0
@entity34 , sitting at the @entity86 , described @entity17 as an ' excellent and caring mother ' emphasising the dangers of ' premature graduation of a child from a harness seat to a booster seat or a seat belt ' , the judge , sitting with @entity95 and @entity96 , said the threat to @entity18 was ' reasonably foreseeable '			1
although mrs @entity9 , like so many other parents , was convinced @entity18 would be safe , the little girl simply ' did not fit all the requirements ' for the booster cushion , concluded the judge , dismissing the mother 's appeal			1
@entity105 , for mrs @entity9 , earlier told the court she had been weaning @entity18 out of her baby seat as she was much more comfortable on the booster			2
the mother had read the instruction leaflet carefully before deciding that @entity18 would be safe			0
in the absence of @entity18 's father , who died before she was born , mrs @entity9 had watched what other people did with their children , asked their advice and did research			0
' as a result of @entity18 's father having died seven weeks before @entity18 was born , if anything mrs @entity9 had been a paranoid mother , always following @entity18 around to ensure that she was safe , ' the barrister added			2
' if the decision to restrain @entity18 in a booster cushion reflected the state of awareness of many other parents , and was clearly a decision that many other parents would have taken , or did take , mrs @entity9 could not be regarded as negligent in taking the decision that she did			2
' @entity129 , for @entity25 ' insurers , said it was ' tragic ' and ' sad ' case , but pointed out that parents doing their absolute best for their children sometimes act negligently and unwittingly cause them harm			0
the result of mrs @entity9 ' appeal will have no impact on the very substantial compensation now due to @entity18 but means that 25 per cent of the bill must be covered by the mother 's insurers .			2
