by @entity0 her firm and tanned physique is one of the most envied in the world			0
and while genetics and a good diet no doubt play a role in @entity9 ’s near perfect body , she also credits plenty of sex for her toned curves			1
in an interview accompanying her steamy – and nearly nude - shoot for @entity15 , the mother of one , who split from husband @entity19 six months ago , said that regular sessions between the sheets is what has been keeping her runway ready			1
‘ the more sex i have , the more defined my arms and stomach get			2
' however , @entity9 has also spoken about how her daily 30 - minute yoga sessions and a ' super healthy ' diet help hone her slender 5ft 9 inch frame			2
so while it may be slightly unrealistic to expect that amping up the bedroom antics will miraculously give you a body worthy of a @entity51 ’s @entity50 model , there is actually some evidence to back @entity9 ’s erotic body secret			1
medical experts have long said that making love can slow down the ageing process , improve the immune system , boost circulation and help you live longer			1
@entity9 also is a big fan of healthy eating and does 30 minutes of yoga daily to keep her figure dr @entity63 , clinical neuropsychologist at the @entity64 , believes the most effective way to keep your youthful looks is to maintain an active love life			2
in his study , dr weeks questioned more than 3,500 volunteers aged between 18 and 102			0
he concludes that couples who make love three times a week look between four and seven years younger than those who have less sex			0
' sex is an excellent aerobic exercise because it raises the heart beat and pumps oxygen around the body which improves the immune system , boosts circulation and keeps you lean , ' he said			0
@entity9 split from her husband of three years @entity19 six months ago , and says since she has not been able to have regular sex she has become less toned although sex is not the most efficient way to lose weight , you can burn between 100 and 250 calories an hour and also exercise the major muscle groups			1
if you have moderately active sex twice a week , you burn an extra 5,000 calories a year - the equivalent of a 50 mile run at a slow pace			1
sexual intercourse also helps keep you lean as it raises levels of insulin - like growth factors ( @entity100 ) - a hormone that controls the activity of enzymes within those cells responsible for fat metabolism			0
when higher levels of @entity100 are released , this helps to break down fatty tissue in the body and promote lean muscle instead .			0

@entity9 credits sex with keeping her body looking perfect
says since *separation* from husband , she has been having less sex and noticed her arms are less toned
medical experts agree sex can help keep you trim and reduce stress
an hour can burn 250 calories and works major muscle groups
