by @entity0 archaeologists in @entity2 have unearthed what they believe to be a skull 8,000 years old that could contain the oldest remnants of a human brain			1
the discovery was made at a dig site in @entity9 , southwest of @entity10			1
initial findings suggest the skull belonged to a child no older than ten years old , while an adult was also buried in a fetal - like position in the grave			1
archaeologists have found what they think is an 8,000 year old human skull in a dig in @entity2			1
shown here is the skull embedded in soil , but the team did not dare to scrape all the loose sand from it in fear of destroying the surface of it			0
it is thought to have belonged to a child of under ten years of age the investigation took place due to a planned building of a big conference centre called the @entity37			1
the skull was found with a gray , clay - like substance inside it and is believed to originate from about 6,000 bc , about 8,000 years ago , in the @entity42 era			1
if confirmed as a human brain this would be one of the oldest brains ever found			2
finds of the sort are very rare because brain tissue typically breaks down rapidly after death			0
it can be preserved , however , in certain conditions			0
studying the brain could reveal insights into ancient diseases or pathological conditions			2
the excavation project involves two sites from the same interval of the @entity42 era , about 6,000 @entity60 , approximately 8,000 years ago			2
@entity61 is known of this period of the @entity63 in eastern @entity2 , making the sites of particular interest			2
@entity66 of the @entity67 in @entity10 , who led the excavation , told @entity69 that normally on sites like this the team finds tools , weapons and production waste - but finding organic material is very rare			1
‘ we thought it was too good to be true , ’ said @entity66			1
‘ locally geologically favourable conditions had preserved the bone material			0
‘ we discovered what turned out to be what we think is a human skull			0
’ the top of the skull was badly preserved and the inside was partly exposed , showing the grey , spongey and clay - like matter			0
‘ we are definitely not sure yet , but i can not imagine this matter being anything else than brain , ’ @entity66 continued			1
the investigation took place due to a planned building of a big conference centre called the @entity37			0
the excavation project involves two sites from the same interval of the @entity42 era the suspected organic matter at the dig site ( pictured ) is thought to originate from about 6,000 bc. researchers think the ' brain ' belonged to a child no older than ten			1
an adult in a fetal position and deer antlers were also found in the grave the team thinks the skull is too small for an adult and is instead probably from an infant of a maximum of ten years of age , which explains the thin and poorly preserved top of the skull			1
‘ as the skull is badly preserved , we had to be very gentle , using small tools that we seldom use on @entity63 sites , ’ @entity66 explains			2
‘ having spent nearly 8,000 years in the pit , we had to keep it from drying out quickly			0
then it would have turned to dust			0
’ the team took the skull in a ‘ big lump ’ with the soil surrounding it , and have so far only examined the parts of the skull that are exposed , which is why they are not 100 per cent sure if it is human			0
they also say the pit was probably a grave , with a number of other bones found inside from another individual , most likely an adult			2
‘ the arm length is roughly the same as mine , i am 1.79 metres [ 5 feet and 10 and a half inches ] tall , so it was probably a man , ’ @entity66 said			0
the adult had been deposited in a fetal position while there were also suspected deer antlers found in the grave			1
@entity66 explains how the material from the grave was saved preliminarily , piece by piece , as partly cleaned bones on sandy soil , to be excavated indoors			2
along with the supposed infant 's skull were also found bones from an adult man and suspected deer antlers ‘ there has evidently been a lot of effort constructing the grave , but we can not tell whether the grave has had some sort of marking on top of it , over the ground , ’ @entity66 said			1
he added : ‘ this is definitely an archaeological sensation			1
’ the next step will be to get bone experts to examine the find closely to determine the age , sex and more of the individuals			0
‘ through dna and various analysis we are hoping to get information about where the individuals grew up , and kind of food they normally ate and more , ’ explains @entity66			0
' not least we get a glimpse into people 's minds , literally , meaning how they treated their dead , religious belief systems and so on			0

archaeological dig near @entity10 , @entity2 may have found an ancient brain
the suspected organic matter is thought to originate from about 6,000 bc
researchers think the ' brain ' belonged to a child no older than ten
an adult in a fetal position and deer antlers were also found in the grave
' this is definitely an archaeological sensation , ' said @entity66 of the @entity67 in @entity10 , who led the excavation
