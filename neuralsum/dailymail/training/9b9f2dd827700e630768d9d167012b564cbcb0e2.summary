by @entity0 published : 16:43 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 07:40 est , 10 june 2012 ambitious : @entity1 has made efforts to soften his bruiser image politics is often described as showbusiness for ugly people - but few mps have taken the saying to heart as much as shadow chancellor @entity1			2
he has secretly commissioned private polling at a cost of thousands of pounds to find out how voters are reacting to him and his economic policies			2
embarrassingly , @entity14 sources say the polling results show that mr @entity1 is still seen as a turn - off by many , both politically and personally			2
a spokesman for mr @entity1 denied claims about the results - but refused to give any more details of what the polling had uncovered			0
so @entity23 commissioned its own survey - and it showed that mr @entity1 is seen as ' uninspiring , untrustworthy and unlikeable '			2
and despite the double - dip recession , the public have more faith in the economic policies of @entity29 and @entity30 than those of mr @entity1 and @entity32 , albeit by a tiny margin			1
the @entity35 survey clearly indicates that mr @entity1 must admit his role in making a mess of the @entity39 's economy as a senior member of the @entity41 of @entity42			2
four in ten people said @entity14 must accept more responsibility for the recession , against one in four who disagreed			1
the @entity48 lead is all the more surprising given that calls by mr @entity32 and mr @entity1 for @entity41 policy to focus more on fostering economic growth have been echoed by international leaders			1
but it is mr @entity1 's personal ratings that are most worrying for him			2
a total of 44 per cent say he is an opportunist , with only 19 per cent describing him as principled			0
nearly one in two say that he is not charismatic , against 13 per cent who think he is			0
and 48 per cent say he is not likeable , compared with 17 per cent who believe he is			0
opposition : calls by @entity32 and @entity1 for @entity41 policy to focus more on fostering economic growth have been echoed by international leaders the results are almost identical when voters are asked if they can trust mr @entity1			1
the @entity66 have fallen to a 14 - point deficit behind @entity14 , according to an opinion poll released today			0
the survey , carried out by pollsters @entity69 for the @entity71 , puts @entity14 on 43 per cent , with @entity29 's party on 29 per cent			1
the @entity66 ' coalition partners , the @entity74 are on just 9 per cent , the same as @entity76 's @entity75			0
@entity14 's lead over the @entity66 is the biggest since december 2002 , when @entity78 was prime minister and @entity79 led the @entity48			1
and almost one in two say they have no idea what his policies are , compared with one in five who say they do			0
asked who they trusted to lead @entity39 out of recession , 29 per cent of those polled chose mr @entity29 and mr @entity30 , with 28 per cent favouring mr @entity32 and mr @entity1			1
despite losing to @entity32 in the @entity14 leadership contest in 2010 , mr @entity1 remains fiercely ambitious and has made considerable efforts to soften his political bruiser image in recent months			1
he admitted to crying while watching the @entity95 's @entity94 and has talked about his love of cooking			0
only last week he tweeted : ' did a v good prune & armagnac sponge pudding this evening from the excellent @entity102 baking book @entity103			0
' mr @entity1 's office refused to confirm reports that the private polling is being carried out by the @entity14 pollster @entity107 , who performed the same role for mr @entity1 's mentor , mr @entity42 , with largely the same negative results			1
the disclosure comes amid growing concern in @entity14 's high command at its failure to win more public support for its economic policies			1
several senior @entity14 figures used a recent shadow cabinet meeting to complain at the party 's failure to win more backing for its attack on the @entity124 's ' austerity @entity39 ' approach			1
the move was seen as a coded attack on mr @entity1			0
denied : labour claim people are losing faith with chancellor @entity30 one shadow minister told @entity23 : ' when the economy is in a mess and @entity30 is widely seen as arrogant and lightweight , @entity14 should be doing much better			1
' on most issues we are way ahead of the @entity66 , but we struggle on the economy			0
@entity1 must take responsibility for that			0
' mr @entity1 's spokesman said last night : ' every political party does private research and polling			0
but given how important the economy is as an issue , @entity1 's office has raised funds in order that the @entity14 can do extra research on the economy			2
' he declined to say where the money had come from or how much the polling had cost			0
later , @entity14 sources denied the private polling was bad news for the @entity154			2
one said : ' our research shows that , with the economy pushed into a double - dip recession , people are increasingly losing faith with @entity29 and @entity30 's economic strategy			1
' clearly , we still have a long way to go to regain economic trust , but we are making good progress and people are starting to open their ears to @entity14 's call for a plan for jobs and growth as part of a balanced plan to get the deficit down			1
' @entity35 interviewed 500 people online on friday .			0

survey shows public has more faith in economic policies of @entity29 and @entity30 than those of @entity32 and @entity1
four in ten people believe @entity14 must take more responsibility for the recession , while nearly half say the @entity154 is not likeable
