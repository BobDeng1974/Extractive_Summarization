@entity1 mp @entity0 has written to @entity2 asking them to review new evidence of attempts to ' buy ' a seat in the @entity7 the mp who sparked the original ‘ cash for honours ’ investigation last night demanded a new police probe into claims that wealthy @entity15 supporters had offered money to the party in an attempt to ‘ buy ’ seats in the @entity7			1
on wednesday the party ’s former treasurer @entity20 admitted he received such approaches from business people ‘ several times a year ’ but instead of reporting them he simply told them to ‘ keep quiet ’			1
last night @entity1 mp @entity0 wrote to @entity2 asking them to review the new evidence , and insisted @entity20 had a duty to name the individuals to the police			1
mr @entity0 , who made the 2006 complaint about @entity32 ’s efforts to secure peerages for wealthy individuals who had loaned the party money , said the peer ’s comments amounted to a ‘ smoking gun ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity20 has to tell the police who these people are and then the police have to talk to them and take it from there			1
‘ it ’s very straightforward really			2
this is not so much the smoke from a smoking gun as the actual gun itself			2
’ his call was backed by the former @entity51 standards watchdog sir @entity52			2
sir @entity52 , who chaired the @entity54 said : ‘ he has a civic responsibility to report people who are attempting to break the law			2
‘ i suppose the reason that people do n’t report it because they are hoping to get donations all the same , ’ he told the @entity58			2
‘ if they have made an offer , by my understanding , they have broken the law			0
i suppose in each case , you would want to ask , did the parties receive a donation from these people anyway ? the @entity72 makes it an offence to offer ‘ any gift , money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour ’			0
but @entity20 , who was in charge of @entity15 finances for 12 years , appeared to think only actually giving someone an honour was a crime			1
in an interview with @entity89 was asked if he had been made ‘ dishonourable ’ offers			0
he replied : ‘ oh @entity92 , yes			0
‘ anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you , if they are honest , that there are numerous people who came to you and said , “ i will give you a million pounds as long as i can go into the @entity7 ”			0
he also said the treasurers of both @entity32 and the @entity100 would say the same			0
‘ there ’s nobody to who that has not happened , and everybody knows what you have to say , which is , “ i ’m terribly sorry , that ’s a criminal offence			0
would you mind keeping quiet ? ”			0
’ asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer , @entity20 replied : ‘ i should think several times a year			1
@entity20 told @entity89 5 live that wealthy people approached him regularly looking to buy peerages mr @entity0 complained to @entity2 earlier this year after comments made by former @entity116 spokesman @entity115 - who quit the party over a plot to oust @entity119			1
@entity115 said , ‘ my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own , and help get the @entity7 elected have failed			1
’ mr @entity0 said he was still waiting for a response from the police to that complaint			1
he added : ‘ the @entity128 need to review this new evidence , which highlights the depths of corruption in our second chamber			1
‘ under the @entity51 system , we have the ludicrous situation that there are far more legislators who are appointed than elected - and people in @entity139 elect only 4 per cent of the @entity51 parliamentarians who hold powers over the economy , welfare , defence , our place in @entity146 , and many other crucial areas of policy			0
‘ while the @entity15 concede the @entity7 is out of date and undemocratic - they continue to stuff it with cronies			0
@entity32 are no better - they say they want a @entity151 but they continue to stuff the @entity7 with their own peers			0
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we are not aware of any of the specific conversations @entity20 discussed			1
‘ as he made clear , any attempt to bribe a political party , and pay for a peerage is illegal			0
these are points he has previously made before select committee hearings , echoed by treasurers from other political parties			0
’ ‘ as the @entity32 cash - for - peerages scandal proved , anyone engaging in this activity should face the full force of the law			2

@entity1 *'s* @entity0 has written to @entity2 calling for action
he said the @entity128 should investigate new evidence of ' cash for peerages '
@entity20 said he received several approaches by wealthy individuals
