more than four decades later , as a way to try to correct potential acts of bias spanning three wars , president @entity17 will bestow the @entity22 on the @entity24 man and 23 other veterans			1
righting a wrong : more than 40 years since serving on a heroic mission in @entity4 , @entity0 will receive a @entity22 initially denied to him because he was black they come after a decade - long congressionally mandated review of minorities who may have been passed over for the @entity33 military 's highest honor because of long - held prejudices			1

after his sept 17 , 1969 , ordeal , the then - staff sgt. @entity0 received a @entity41 in 1970			1
he said he never realized that being black might have kept the higher honor from him			0
' i never really did worry about decorations , ' @entity0 said			2

' president @entity17 said he was sorry this did n't happen before			1
he said this should have been done 44 years ago			0

he had to keep the medal a secret since @entity17 's call and said he 's happy to be honored , but that it 's even more important to recognize his friends that never returned home			1
' those that are n't even here to receive their medals , those are my heroes , ' said @entity0 , who retired from the @entity46 in 1986 as a sergeant first class			2
' they gave their whole life			0
