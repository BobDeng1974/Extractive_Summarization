@entity0 believes @entity1 can come good this season once they have got over their current injury crisis			1
the @entity4 lie seventh in the @entity6 - eight points off the leaders @entity8 - but @entity0 says @entity1 should only be judged as a side when everyone is fit			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are all sidelined through injury , with @entity15 being forced to hand a senior debut to @entity17 against @entity18 last week , due to the lack of defenders available to him			1
@entity0 made 386 appearances in all for @entity1 in 11 years at the club after leaving @entity1 , @entity0 moved to @entity24 , where he played for eight seasons and @entity0 is under no illusions as to how big a role that has played in @entity1 's indifferent start to the season			1
he told @entity30 : ' it 's been a bit up and down for @entity1			2
the biggest problem is the amount of injuries - to have nine or 10 out , particularly in key areas of the pitch , means you 're always going to struggle			0
' the time to judge this team is when everybody is fit			2
people are having a go at the defence but there have been no centre - backs fit all season			0
@entity0 was part of the coaching staff under the @entity52 and @entity53 tenures at @entity1 last season but was not retained by @entity15 ' soon , @entity13 , @entity11 and @entity12 will be back and the manager can start playing his best pairing at centre - back			1
' i 'm sure these players will come good			0
i 've got every faith in them			0
i 've coached them , played with and against them , and i know the qualities they have got			0
' @entity1 entertain another of @entity0 's former teams @entity24 on sunday , with the 37 - year - old unsure how @entity69 's side will fare at @entity70 , on the back of a near 4,000 mile trip to @entity73 in mid-week owing to @entity75 commitments			1
he added : ' i think to come back from @entity73 and play on sunday at 12 o'clock is really difficult , from past experience , so i feel @entity1 have got to have a fast start and keep the tempo high to make sure @entity24 feel the effects of the @entity75 game			2
' @entity24 have let in too many goals which is unlike them , and every goal has been an individual error			0
but it was their best defensive performance at @entity86 [ last weekend ] when they cut out the silly mistakes and became hard to beat			0

the former @entity1 player and coach believes the @entity4 ' form has been severely *hampered* by their injury problems
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are among the first - team players currently sidelined for @entity15 's side
@entity0 says @entity1 should be judged as a team when everyone is fit
another of @entity0 's former sides @entity24 travel to @entity70 on sunday
the 37 - year - old says he is unsure what kind of *challenge* the @entity24 will pose to @entity1 after a mid-week @entity107 *fixture* in @entity73
