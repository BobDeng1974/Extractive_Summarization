@entity0 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity3 , and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its @entity6			1
two concept images have emerged that show @entity0 ’s next - generation handset with a slender chassis , as well as a larger 5 - inch screen similar to those seen on the @entity14 and @entity15			1
the first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the ' @entity18 ' - will be 4.5mm thick , while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom			1
this concept , by @entity32 - based firm set solution , predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom , in order to retain the home button up until august last year , @entity37 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity41 , at 6.18mm			1
this was then replaced by the @entity43 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity0 ’s current @entity44 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity3 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1
@entity47 's @entity14 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity15 is 9.3mm			0
by comparison , @entity0 ’s current @entity44 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity3 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1

[ embed in order to make the @entity0 phone super-thin , @entity54 's concept - dubbed @entity18 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls by comparison , @entity0 's current @entity44 , pictured , has a depth of 7.6mm			1
this makes it 1.7mm thinner than the @entity69 and 1.37mm thinner than the @entity70 @entity0 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity3 ( pictured ) which is 20 % thinner than previous models @entity75 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			1
it also appears taller than @entity54 ’s version in order to fit the larger screen			0
@entity0 ’s @entity6 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity44 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			1
@entity0 ’s ceo @entity89 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			2
however , with main rivals @entity47 , @entity15 and @entity95 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity0 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			2
last november , designer @entity102 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity6 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			2
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			0
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			0
according to @entity121 journalist @entity120 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity0 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			2
up until august last year , @entity37 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity41 , at 6.18mm , pictured left			0
this was then replaced by the @entity43 at just 5.75mm , pictured right it has been widely accepted @entity0 's rumoured 4.7 - inch @entity6 6 ( concept pictured left ) will debut in september , with the 5.5 - inch model launching in 2015			2
this was blamed on manufacturing problems			0
the latest reports , instead , are blaming this staggered release date on @entity0 's marketing strategy			0

one concept shows the next @entity6 being just 4.5mm thick
another shows handset as 1.5mm thick at the top and 3mm at the bottom
this could make it more than half the thickness of the 7.6mm @entity44
@entity0 released a super-thin version of its @entity3 last year called @entity157
any slender handsets could follow suit and be dubbed @entity18
