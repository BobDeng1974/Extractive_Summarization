free man : @entity1 , 20 , pictured at the @entity2 earlier in his trial , was cleared of sexual assault a judge has attacked prosecutors over a mismanaged rape case in which a former public schoolboy was accused of assaulting a friend after a night of drinking			1
@entity1 , 20 , walked free from the @entity2 yesterday after being cleared of all charges of attacking his ex-classmate in her university halls			1
it can now be reported that judge @entity15 had urged prosecutors to drop the case before the trial had even begun			1
during the hearing he also criticised the @entity20 over some of the evidence submitted			1
mr @entity1 , who now works for a currency consultancy after leaving his £ 30,000 - a - year boarding school , had been accused of attempting to rape the law student after a boozy night out			1
he told the court that a sexual encounter had happened and was ‘ definitely consensual ’			2
mr @entity1 was cleared of assault by penetration by the unanimous verdict of the jury of five men and seven women			1
he had earlier been formally cleared of attempted rape on the instruction of judge @entity37 , who criticised the @entity20			1
he told prosecutor @entity38 : ‘ these were people who were good friends of each other , close friends who spent the evening drinking quite a considerable quantity of alcohol together , at the end of which the allegation is the defendant in a drunken state took advantage of her			0
‘ it is something which he bitterly regretted as soon as it happened and he was stopped in the course of it			0
‘ some might say to go through the process now is going to make matters worse rather than better , but that ’s a matter for the complainant and the @entity58			0
’ mr @entity1 , was accused of pouncing on the 19 - year - old woman when they shared a bed after a drunken night out in central @entity62 on october 8 last year			1
the pair had shared two bottles of wine before she had invited him back to her room after he missed the last tube			0
@entity69 showed the pair holding hands and hugging on their way back to her halls			2
mr @entity1 said he had decided to ‘ go for it ’ after she had kissed him and invited him into her bed			1
he said she had pushed herself against his groin			0
he touched her intimately and when she told him to stop a confused mr @entity1 said he left soon afterwards			1
she claimed he had pulled off her pyjama bottoms and knickers while she slept			0
a fortnight later mr @entity1 , who works at @entity83 , was hauled in by police for questioning			1
he was charged five months later , but the case against him began to unravel as soon as the two - week trial began			2
verdict : judge @entity15 said , ' it would be helpful for someone from the @entity20 to be in court and see the problems created at cases which are n't investigated properly ' the jury struggled to follow a video interview with the alleged victim , and it was left to the defence team to produce a transcript			1
police experts had been unable to download key texts sent and received by the woman , and had resorted to taking photos of the screens , which were barely legible			0
forced into yet another adjournment because evidence was not ready , judge @entity37 said : ‘ i would never have started this case if i had known it would take this course			2
that is a shortcoming of the investigation of this matter			0
’ it then emerged that vital messages sent by the alleged victim hours after the incident had been wiped			2
police were forced to admit they had not seized her phone after she first complained , and waited six months before analysing it			0
invited home : mr @entity1 told the @entity2 how his accuser invited him home and forced him away after he started performing a sex act on her when he learned the alleged victim had not been questioned about the missing texts , the judge took a further swipe at the @entity20 for pursuing the case			1
he said : ‘ sometimes it would be helpful for someone from the @entity20 to be in court and see the problems created at cases which are n’t investigated properly , and the consequences , instead of being at the end of the phone opining whether cases should go ahead or not			2
’ in spiky exchanges with miss @entity38 , the judge asked whether the @entity20 knew ‘ what a mess had been made of the telephone evidence ’			2
mr @entity1 ’s defence team narrowly failed to have the case against him thrown out , and then brought forward a string of glowing character references			1
the former head girl at his school described mr @entity1 as a ‘ gentleman ’ who could always be trusted to look after his friends			1
she said her baby - faced friend , an accomplished musician and singer , had never taken advantage of her and was shy around girls			0
trial : the judge of the criminal hearing at the @entity2 in @entity62 ( pictured ) said he would not have started the trial had he known the parlous state of the evidence mr @entity1 , of @entity157 , @entity158 , denied attempted rape and assault by penetration			1
his barrister @entity162 said she was considering making a wasted costs application in addition to her client ’s defence costs because of the way the case was handled			0
the judge said any costs application would be heard at a later date			0
the verdict comes after a retired judge warned recently that rape convictions will not improve until women stop drinking heavily			0
@entity177 , 66 , told the @entity178 of the difficulties of bringing sex assault cases to court when the alleged victim had been drinking			2
she said : ‘ i will also say , and i will be pilloried for saying so , but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk			0
‘ i ’m not saying it ’s right to rape a drunken woman , i ’m not saying for a moment that it ’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman			0
‘ but a jury in a position where they ’ve got a woman who says “ i was absolutely off my head , i ca n’t really remember what i was doing , i ca n’t remember what i said , i ca n’t remember if i consented or not but i know i would n’t have done ”			0
‘ i mean when a jury is faced with something like that , how are they supposed to react ? ’			0
