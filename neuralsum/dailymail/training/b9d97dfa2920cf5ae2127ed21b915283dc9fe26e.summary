@entity0 has come a long way - very fast - from winning a junior @entity3 title two years ago while staying at the home of @entity5			1
her meteoric rise , which has continued apace since the start of the year , when she was ranked 32 , now sees her achieving a first final appearance in only the sixth @entity10 she has entered			1
the 20 - year - old @entity11 , named after a @entity13 princess , is one match away from being crowned the @entity15 after beating world no 3 @entity17 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 on @entity18			1
the comparisons with @entity43 may soon extend to a shared long list of commercial tie - ups and mentions on the @entity47 rich list of athletes , but what most closely bonds them is their steely competitiveness			1
semi-finals are about mental strength more than the finesse of anyone ’s game and beneath her cherubic exterior , @entity0 is as tough as they come , as she amply showed on thursday			1
there was a hiatus in the first set when @entity17 took a tumble and had her ankle strapped - which hampered her serving somewhat - and then another lasting four minutes when she trailed 2 - 3 in the tiebreaker after a spectator collapsed in the heat			1
@entity0 ’s concentration rode serenely through them both , and only when the winning post came into view did she betray any sign of nerves against an opponent also known as a fine competitor			1
dominant : after taking a tense first set on a tie - break , @entity0 raced through the second 6 - 2 embrace : @entity0 and @entity17 shake hands after their semi-final clash on @entity18 hurt : @entity17 rolled her ankle early in the match and appeared to be struggling with her movement watching from the @entity82 was the relatively new chief executive of the @entity84 , @entity11 @entity83			1
he got the job partly due to the progress being made in the sport in his native land that has manifested itself this week in the success of @entity0 and @entity90			2
it is possible the @entity93 ’ dinner might have to be draped in the @entity94 on sunday night if @entity90 blasts his way through as well , but @entity0 has beaten him to being the first @entity11 into a @entity10 singles final			1
one of the remarkable aspects about her is the matter - of - fact attitude towards what she has achieved			2
others might have been surprised by it , but she is not			2
incident : a spectator was taken from the court unwell during the first - set tie - break hold up : play was held up for four minutes with the score at 3 - 2 in the first - set tie - break she handles questions about her ambitions - or her supposed admiration for @entity111 - with an aplomb beyond her years			2
‘ it ’s not like a surprise to me			2
i expect good results like this , ’ she said			2
‘ so for me , i was like , ok , good			2
it ’s a step in the right direction			0
i get to play in the final			1
' i still have another match , so it ’s not a full celebration yet			0
i get to make @entity11 history again			1
it ’s always exciting and special when i can make history			0
my job is not done			0
’ in tennis , many players get distracted if their opponent is carrying an injury but @entity0 retained the same laser focus throughout			0
‘ i ’m able to not worry about the distractions , especially when it ’s out of my control , ’ she said			0
picture : @entity18 was bathed in sunshine on women 's semi-finals day at @entity3 ‘ someone in the crowd not feeling well is definitely out of my control			0
i really do n’t let it get to me or affect me			0
i love being challenged and i love working hard to try to overcome something			0
i see it as an opportunity			0
’ @entity0 sees it as a compliment to be compared to @entity43 , but only in terms of the @entity147 being a five - times major winner			0
that would have seemed unthinkable three years ago when her final opponent , @entity26 , won the title while @entity0 was reaching the quarter - finals of the junior event			1
the @entity11 ’s ability to take the ball early troubles most opponents , and there was a bonus for her in that @entity17 , the recent @entity30 finalist , struggled with her serve after the tumble			1
yet it was fairly even in the first set with breaks exchanged until the tiebreak , when the elderly fan got into difficulties			0
just after that @entity0 fell 2 - 4 behind before reeling off the next four points and then clinching it 7 - 5			0
the @entity168 subsequently lost a bit of heart and the only blot on @entity0 ’s performance was that it took six match points from 5 - 1 up before she landed an unplayable first serve that put her through to the final			1
her presence there will add to the growing sentiment across the men ’s and women ’s games that the plates of both top 10s are shifting .			0

the @entity11 *sealed* her place in the final in straight sets against @entity17
she now faces @entity26 , who beat @entity190 in the other semi
