by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 13:29 est , 12 february 2013 an out - of - hours doctor has been jailed for two - and - a - half years for manslaughter after he failed to send a seriously ill diabetic man to hospital - diagnosing him as ' depressed with a headache '			1
dr @entity7 ignored the classic signs of diabetes - related poisonous acids building up in 42 - year - old @entity11 ' body , a court heard			1
instead of dialling 999 for an ambulance , the on - call locum told mr fellows ' mother that her son was depressed and had a headache and should see his own doctor the next day			2
less than nine hours later mr @entity11 died at home from diabetic ketoacidosis			1
@entity22 @entity21 heard how mr @entity11 became thirsty in the week before he died a test which takes less than a minute would have alerted the @entity24 to raised blood - sugar levels and it is ' virtually certain ' mr @entity11 would have survived with an insulin injection and rehydration			1
jailing the doctor judge @entity29 told him : ' it was criminal negligence and a wholly preventable death followed			1
' experts who examined the case said any competent doctor would have recognised the classic symptoms of ketoacidosis and dr @entity7 's breach of duty to his patient was ' appalling and gross			1
' it was revealed at @entity44 that the gp was based in @entity45 but flew to @entity46 to work every summer for two or three months for the nationwide doctors ' deputising service @entity49			2
he was arrested in the @entity51 and extradited after a @entity22 coroner adjourned an inquest into mr fellows ' death for police investigations			1
father - of - two @entity7 , 64 , admitted causing the death of mr fellows by gross negligence in failing to carry out an adequate clinical assessment , failing to send mr fellows to hospital as an emergency and failing to diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis from which he died			1
@entity64 , prosecuting , said mr fellows , who lived with his family in @entity66 , @entity22 had no medical history of diabetes but suffered from anxiety and depression			1
in the week before his death , the painter and decorator was working outside and became restless and began drinking huge quantities of water			1
both he and his mother @entity76 believed he had caught sunstroke			2
when her son 's condition worsened mrs fellows called @entity49 at 17.50 on june 4 , 2009			2
she told a triage nurse her son was ' very muddled and mumbling ' , his breathing was erratic and his eyes were sunken with his breath smelling odd ' like pear drops			2
' she was asked about his depression and replied : ' he had had episodes before but if this is depression i 've never seen one as bad as this			2
' dr @entity7 was asked to attend mr @entity11 and arrived at 21.13			1
mrs @entity78 expected her son to be taken to hospital and had even packed a bag for him			2
mrs @entity78 asked if her son was in a coma or had an infection and specifically if he might be diabetic			1
' she says dr @entity7 shook his head to all these questions , ' said mr @entity102			1
' according to @entity103 fellows , dr @entity7 did not have any equipment with him and did not examine her son			1
he said he was depressed and advised that he should see his own gp the following day for his medication to be reviewed			0
' after the doctor left , mrs fellows gave her son something to drink but he could not swallow			0
he appeared so dehydrated she gave him an ice cube at 1am			0
she returned at 6am to find him dead in bed			0
the court heard mr @entity11 had basically run out of insulin in his body			1
it switched to burning fatty acids and produced acidic ketones			0
when ketones are produced in excess the blood becomes more acidic and blood - sugar levels rise leading to a coma which can be fatal			0
professor of @entity123 , who reviewed the case , said he considered the patient 's confusion , thirst , smell , sunken eyes and inability to answer were ' classic symptoms of ketoacidosis			1
' dr @entity7 should have checked sugar levels in the patient 's blood or urine and he should have been immediately admitted to hospital ' where he could have been treated or saved			1
' professor @entity139 , a retired professor of clinical diabetes , said the @entity24 's records were ' grossly deficient ' and he could and should have measured blood sugar			1
' it would have taken less than a minute and shown high blood sugar levels			0
dr @entity7 should then have called for for an ambulance as an emergency ... the failure to diagnose his condition was the main cause of death			1
' dr @entity7 , who worked as a gp in @entity22 from 1981 to 1988 before returning to @entity45 , was arrested in the @entity51 on august 27 , 2012 and brought back to the @entity46			1
when questioned he admitted he had a blood - sugar testing kit in his car which he failed to use			1
just a fortnight after mr @entity11 died , dr @entity7 attended another patient @entity155 who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and prescribed insulin			1
he felt unwell but the @entity24 told him not to take his insulin as well as failing to examine him or test for ketones			1
a consultant said the advice to stop taking insulin was ' wholly inappropriate ' and lack of insulin would have put the patient ' in a life - threatening situation in a matter of hours			2
' in a victim impact statement @entity78 said that to test her son 's blood ' would have been such a small thing to do but that one small thing would have saved her son 's life			0
' @entity174 , defending , said the doctor had ' misdirected ' himself			0
he had a particular interest in mental health matters and coupled with mr @entity11 not taking his medication it led him to rule out diabetes as a risk factor			2
he qualified as a doctor in @entity45 in 1973 and came to the @entity46 a year later			0
he completed his training before becoming a gp and had been subject to appraisals in the years leading up to these events			0
' he is not allowed to practise without supervision , ' said mr @entity186			0
he had now decided to quit as a doctor and ' will not be working in the @entity46 ever again			0
' his wife back in @entity45 was ill and lived alone and had been badly affected by his arrest			0
judge @entity29 told @entity190 : ' you have devoted your working life to caring for others			0
i have seen glowing references as to your competence , empathy and thoughtfulness			0
' it is a tragedy for you that this brought about an end to your career , destroyed your good character and your ability to work in this country			0
' he went on : ' however the nature of your offending is too serious for anything other than a custodial sentence			0
' you failed to recognise @entity213 fellows ' condition despite the fact that all the classic signs of a diabetic condition were present			1
' he had opted for a diagnosis that was contrary to all the evidence			0
' that was a gross breach of your duty of care , ' said the judge			2
' an expert has called your decision appalling			0
it was clearly criminally negligent and a wholly preventable death followed			2
' after the hearing @entity78 said : ' we want everyone to know how much we loved @entity11			0
he was a loving son , brother , grandson , uncle , nephew and cousin and his death has caused a huge hole in the lives of everyone who knew him			2
' he was honest and upright , funny and sensitive			0
he loved science and nature and was very proud of the fact that he got a @entity245 degree later in life			0
' he was known to his friends as " @entity248 " and was described by them as the man with the hundred watt smile			0

dr @entity7 failed to recognise diabetic ketoacidosis
@entity254 had no history of diabetes but his body ran out of insulin
@entity7 , 64 , admitted causing the death by gross negligence
