@entity0 today issues the stark threat that manned border posts could be introduced if @entity3 backs independence in next week 's historic vote			1
with just 11 days to go until the referendum - and polls showing growing momentum for @entity13 's nationalists - the @entity8 leader has urged voters to face up to the consequences of severing the 300 - year - old @entity15			1
' if you do n't want borders , vote to stay in the @entity18 , ' mr @entity0 said in an interview with today 's @entity20			1
' and mr @entity0 's spokesman added last night : ' the last time i looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them			1
it would be up to us , not mr @entity13 , to secure our northern border			1
' the prospect was raised as a shock poll showed that 51 per cent of @entity3 would vote ‘ yes ’ to going it alone with just 49 per cent saying ‘ no ’			1
the results of the @entity49 survey means that the ‘ @entity51 ’ campaign has overturned a 22 - point lead within a month			1
until now , mr @entity13 ’s @entity53 has insisted that a separate @entity3 would be part of a common , free movement area with the rest of the @entity18 and @entity57			0
guards on the border : where the controls could be placed if @entity3 wins independence in 11 days ' time but a @entity64 source backed mr @entity0 , saying : ‘ all the research shows that if there is a material difference between the immigration policy adopted by an independent @entity3 and the rest of the @entity18 , then border controls would have to be introduced			1
’ it raises the extraordinary prospect of drivers having to stop at manned barriers on the borders to show their passports			0
soccer pundit @entity77 and a ‘ squad ’ of great @entity3 footballers from all eras of the game have called on ‘ every patriotic @entity82 ’ to vote no to independence			0
the other players who signed up to a statement are : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
with the latest opinion polls showing mr @entity0 on course to win may ’s general election , a @entity104 could be in charge of negotiating @entity3 ’s passage to independence by march 2016 if the referendum returns a ‘ yes ’ vote			1
the @entity53 dismissed the idea of border controls as a ‘ scare story ’ , but mr @entity0 ’s advisers say it is not an idle threat : a secret memo drawn up by the @entity116 in 2009 warned that a secure border would have to be established to protect the ‘ remaining @entity18 ’ if an independent @entity3 applied to join the @entity118			1
all new @entity118 members are obliged to accept the @entity121 open borders scheme , meaning travellers from the continent would be free to fly into @entity3 without immigration checks			2
but @entity18 has opted out of the scheme , and erects border controls to vet travellers from @entity121 countries , raising the prospect of a new @entity130 between the two nations			2
new border posts would cause chaos for travellers and prove to be hugely damaging to business			2
the 95 - mile border , which runs from @entity136 on the east coast to the @entity138 in the west , cuts through 21 roads , including two major trunk routes , the @entity142 and @entity143			1
no idle threat by mr @entity0 : a memo drawn up by the @entity116 in 2009 warned that a secure border would have to be established to protect the ‘ remaining @entity18 ’ if an independent @entity3 applied to join the @entity118 a total of 23 million vehicle crossings a year are made on the roads , in addition to seven million passenger journeys on the @entity153 and @entity154 railway lines			1
if controls were set up , immigration staff could man barriers on the roads while the train terminals would have to install checks similar to those adopted by @entity161			2
last night former labour home secretary @entity162 echoed mr @entity0 ’s warning by referring to last week ’s riots in @entity165 when immigrants attempted to storm a ferry			2
‘ were the @entity3 to vote “ yes ” to separation , the issue of border controls and the threat of entry through @entity3 ports and airports would take on serious proportions , ’ mr @entity162 told @entity176			2
support for @entity13 's camp has soared , with a poll last night putting the @entity51 vote on 51 per cent ‘ this is one issue that has not yet emerged as a key part of the debate over @entity3 ’s future			1
there is much at stake and little sign of @entity104 action in response			0
’ panic spread through the ‘ no ’ campaign last week after an opinion poll showed that its lead over the nationalists had shrunk to just six points , with support for mr @entity13 ’s position up by eight points in a month			2
mr @entity200 is happy to let mr @entity0 make the running for the @entity203 campaign as @entity8 supporters make up a large proportion of the ‘ undecided ’ voters			0
the prime minister paid his annual visit to the @entity209 at @entity210 yesterday , but accepted the advice of @entity213 aides not to join her at the @entity214 in case it was seen as ‘ politicising ’ the @entity217			0
it is also in mr @entity0 ’s interest to defeat the nationalists : if @entity3 voters had been excluded from the last election , mr @entity200 would have won a clear @entity224 majority without the need for a @entity226			0
the scale of @entity8 fears over a possible ‘ yes ’ vote was laid bare yesterday when the party ’s @entity230 were told to get up to @entity3 to save the @entity15			0
in an email to all @entity234 , chief whip @entity232 revealed that @entity8 had booked scores of train tickets to get them to go north of the border before the referendum			1
in his interview , mr @entity0 also mentioned his ‘ personal connection ’ with @entity3 – his father , @entity242 , was stationed at @entity243 , @entity244 , during the @entity245			0
‘ the rest of the @entity18 would be much weaker without @entity3			0
it matters for reasons of heart and for head , ’ he said			0
former @entity250 leader @entity250 urged fellow ‘ no ’ campaigners to hold their nerve , saying : ‘ there is a flavour of detail and substance being swept aside in a tide of emotion and exclusive patriotism			2
it is a dangerous time for the no campaign			0
’ asked about mr @entity0 ’s remarks , a spokesman for @entity263 said : ‘ there will be no border posts between an independent @entity3 and the rest of the @entity18			1
‘ the no campaign will say anything to try to scare people into throwing away this unique opportunity to put our future into our own hands			0
they ’ll always put what ’s right for @entity224 above what ’s best for @entity3			0
@entity278 posts manned by guards take the prize for one of the sillier scare stories			0
’ by @entity283 , @entity284 the centuries - old union between @entity3 and @entity26 was in jeopardy last night , as for the first time an opinion poll showed a majority of referendum voters backing independence			1
in a result that shocked @entity224 , 51 per cent of @entity3 questioned by @entity49 said they would vote ‘ yes ’ to going it alone with ‘ no ’ down to 49			1
with ‘ do n’t know ’ responses included , ‘ yes ’ was still ahead 47 to 46 with 7 per cent undecided			2
the survey for @entity296 is the first independent poll to put the nationalist camp ahead and follows a series of results that indicated growing support for independence			1
the @entity51 campaign has overturned a 22 - point lead in the space of a month			1
in the first week in august , the no campaign had a 22 - point lead – 61 per cent against 39 per cent			2
week by week since then the camps have converged			0
now those supporting the union find themselves behind for the first time			0
the momentum appears to have swung behind @entity13 after he was declared winner of the second televised debate with @entity315 , chairman of the increasingly nervous better together campaign			0
alarm bells started ringing a week ago in the no camp when a poll showed their lead had shrunk to six points			1
with only 11 days to go before the historic referendum , politicians and business leaders backing the union will have to redouble their efforts to win over undecided voters			1
@entity200 and the @entity209 – said to have a ‘ great deal of concern ’ about @entity3 breaking away – will appear in public at church in @entity210 this week			0
@entity333 last night blamed the @entity334 ’ unpopular policies for the closeness of the vote			0
mr @entity315 said last night : ‘ the polls may conflict , but the message i take from them is clear : if you want @entity3 to remain part of the @entity18 family you have to vote for it on 18 september			0

labour leader revealed passport checks ' would have to be looked at '
his spokesman : ' it would be up to us to secure our northern border '
comes as shock poll puts @entity51 camp ahead on 51 **%** to no camp 's 49 **%**
