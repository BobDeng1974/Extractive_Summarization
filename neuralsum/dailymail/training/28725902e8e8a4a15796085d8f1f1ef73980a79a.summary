@entity0 is facing fresh outrage over its meagre contribution to the @entity4 taxman , after revealing it paid just £ 20million in corporation tax last year			1
the @entity7 - based internet giant has faced stinging criticism for using a complex corporate structure that allows it to route @entity4 sales through @entity12 to slash its tax bill			1
and the scheme appears to have again paid off			0
luck has nothing to do with it : @entity0 has managed to slash its @entity4 tax bill to just £ 20million last night it revealed in accounts filed to @entity19 that it paid £ 20.4million in taxes last year – despite admitting earlier this year that it pulls in £ 3.3billion of revenues in @entity4 , largely from advertising			2
but in accounts filed last night @entity0 @entity4 said it made a profit of £ 70.8million before tax on sales of £ 642million			2
these numbers are artificially low because @entity0 officially registers much of its @entity4 sales in @entity12 , where the headline rate of corporation tax is 12.5 per cent compared with 21 per cent in the @entity4			1
and the internet behemoth is then able to slash its bill even further by siphoning cash out of @entity12 by paying royalties to another firm based in the tax haven of @entity37			1
' deeply disappointed ' : @entity38 's on @entity0 's tax - avoidance policy when it came to light last year @entity0 ’s aggressive tax avoidance policy has sparked criticism from campaign groups and politicians including @entity38			0
the @entity44 last year declared himself ‘ deeply disappointed ’ that @entity0 , which employs almost 2,000 people in the @entity4 , is able to get away with paying so little tax			0
@entity0 has defended itself by pointing to its record of employing people in the @entity4 and investing more than £ 300million in @entity50 property			0
but @entity51 has moved to crack down on the company , slapping it with a tax bill of nearly £ 800million earlier this year after raiding its @entity55 offices .			0

@entity7 - based *search* *provider* routes @entity4 sales through low - tax @entity12
the tax rate there is just 12.5 per cent , compared with 21 per cent in @entity4
@entity0 then slashes the bill even more by siphoning money to @entity37
