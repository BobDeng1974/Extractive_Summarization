the @entity1 has lost emails from five more employees who are part of congressional probes into the treatment of conservative groups that applied for tax - exempt status , the tax service disclosed on friday			1
the @entity1 said in june that it could not locate an untold number of emails to and from @entity11 , who headed the @entity1 division that processes applications for tax - exempt status during the time that the targeting of @entity17 groups occurred			1
that revelation set off a new round of investigations and congressional hearings			0
on friday , the @entity1 issued a report to @entity23 saying the agency also lost emails from five other employees related to the probe , including two agents who worked in a @entity30 office processing applications for tax - exempt status			1
@entity11 is pictured here in march during a hearing on @entity39 the disclosure came on the same day the @entity42 's subcommittee on investigations released competing reports on how the @entity1 handled applications from political groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections			1
the @entity49 report , released by sen. @entity50 of @entity51 , said both liberal and conservative groups were mistreated , revealing no political bias by the @entity1			1
the @entity55 report , issued by sen. @entity56 of @entity57 , said conservative groups were clearly treated worse			1
the @entity1 inspector general set off a firestorm last year with an audit that said @entity1 agents singled out tea party and other conservative groups for inappropriate scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
@entity11 's lost emails prompted a new round of scrutiny by @entity23 , the @entity70 , the inspector general and at least two federal judges			1
the @entity1 blamed computer crashes for all the lost emails			2
in a statement , the @entity1 said all the crashes happened well before @entity23 launched its investigations			1
the @entity1 first told @entity23 in june that other employees involved in the probe also had computer problems			1
at the time , @entity1 commissioner @entity81 promised lawmakers a report on whether any had lost emails			1
the report was issued friday			0
' throughout this review , the @entity1 has found no evidence that any @entity1 personnel deliberately destroyed any evidence , ' the @entity1 statement said			1
' to the contrary , the computer issues identified appear to be the same sorts of issues routinely experienced by employees within the @entity1 , in other government agencies and in the private sector			0
' when @entity23 started investigating the @entity1 last year , the agency identified 82 employees who might have documents related to the inquiries			1
the @entity1 said 18 of those people had computer problems between september 2009 and february 2014			0
of those employees , five probably lost emails — in addition to @entity11 — the agency said friday			2
@entity11 , who was placed on leave and later retired , has emerged as a central figure in congressional investigations			2
the other five employees appear to be more junior than she			0
in addition to the @entity30 workers , they include a technical adviser to @entity11 , a tax law specialist and a group manager in the tax - exempt division			1
in general , the @entity1 said the workers archived emails on their computer hard drives when their email accounts became too full			2
when those computers crashed , their emails were lost			0
' by all accounts , in each instance the user contacted it staff and attempted to recover his or her data , ' the @entity1 statement said			0
the @entity1 has said it stored emails on backup tapes but those tapes were re-used every six months			2
the inspector general 's office is reviewing those tapes to see if any old emails can be retrieved			0
' the @entity1 has lost thousands of emails , but worse yet , completely lost the @entity139 people 's trust , ' said @entity140 , a spokeswoman for @entity141 republicans			2
' the @entity70 must appoint a special prosecutor so the full truth can come out			0
' attorney general @entity144 has turned down numerous requests from congressional @entity55 for a special prosecutor , citing numerous investigations already underway			2
in this april 9 , 2013 photo @entity49 sen. @entity50 , left , talks with @entity55 sen. @entity56 , on @entity39 in @entity151			0
after investigating the @entity1 for more than a year , the two senators said today that they disagree on whether the tax agency treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax - exempt status friday 's reports by the @entity42 subcommittee on investigations mark the conclusion of just one investigation			1
the @entity70 and three other congressional committees are continuing their probes			0
@entity50 is chairman of the investigations subcommittee and @entity56 is the ranking @entity55			2
their staffs routinely work together on investigations , and while they do n't always agree on the results , it is highly unusual for them to issue such diverging reports			0
the investigation found that the @entity1 used inappropriate selection criteria , burdensome questions and lengthy delays in processing applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax exempt status from both conservative and liberal groups , ' @entity50 said in a statement			1
the @entity49 report slams last year 's audit by the @entity1 inspector general			2
it says the @entity183 report was incomplete because it focused only on the treatment of conservative groups			1
the @entity183 's report ' produced distorted audit results that continue to be misinterpreted , ' the @entity49 report said			0
@entity188 , the treasury inspector general for tax administration , said his investigation is ongoing , with facts ' still coming to light			0
' ' i firmly stand behind the audit report that we issued last year , showing the inappropriate treatment of applicants for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status , for which the @entity1 apologized , ' @entity188 said in a statement			2
' it is important to remember that the @entity1 accepted all of the recommendations contained in our audit report			0
' @entity56 's report says far more conservative groups were singled out for extra scrutiny			1
they were also asked more questions and were more likely to have their applications rejected or withdrawn			0
' the @entity1 selected conservative groups out of normal processing , placed them on a separate list , stopped work on their applications completely , forced them to answer intrusive questions about their behavior and demeanor at meetings and delayed their applications for multiple years , ' the @entity55 report said			1
' our investigation has uncovered no evidence that liberal groups received the same expansive inappropriate treatment that conservative groups received			1
' the @entity49 report said investigators reviewed 800,000 pages of documents and conducted 22 interviews with current and former workers at the @entity1 and the inspector general 's office			0
the investigators were not allowed to see confidential taxpayer information , so many of the documents were blacked out , however			0
only two committees in @entity23 have the authority to see confidential taxpayer information : the @entity141 and the @entity242			0
those two committees are continuing their probes .			0

in june the @entity1 admitted it could not locate an untold number of emails to and former tax - exempt division director @entity11
@entity11 is the the *suspected* *ringleader* of the targeting scheme
the @entity1 said in a report to @entity23 today that it ' found no evidence that any @entity1 personnel deliberately destroyed any evidence '
a separate report released today by @entity257 on a subcommittee on investigations *claims* that the @entity1 did n't treat conservatives *unfairly*
a *conflicting* report issued by @entity55 on the committee says that conservative groups were far more likely to be scrutinized by the @entity1
