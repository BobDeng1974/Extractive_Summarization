the look on @entity2 figure skater @entity1 's said it all saturday after judges in @entity5 scored her a 63.10 in her @entity7 debut			1
the look of disgust was in stark contrast to the radiant smile she displayed just moments earlier after completing her routine			1
@entity14 , 22 , clearly believed she 'd pulled off a performance worthy of a high score as she waved , smiled and blew kisses to the audience			1
all smiles : @entity1 of the @entity2 celebrates in the ' kiss and cry ' area during the @entity23 at the @entity24 shock : @entity14 reacts to her score after competing in the @entity28 during day one of the @entity24 at @entity29 on february 8 but her smile turned upside down when the score came in , which left her in fourth place			1
' i know roughly when i skate a good program where the score should end up ... so yeah to score that low was very disappointing for me , ' she said afterwards			2
' but honestly this performance was more for myself and mentally getting beyond this past couple of weeks			0
and i wanted to do everything i could to help out the team , and i really feel that i delivered on that part			2
' @entity14 may feel that she 's got something to prove after her selection over @entity45 sparked a backlash on social media			0
@entity45 finished third at the @entity48 in @entity49 last month while @entity14 finished in fourth place , yet it was she who was selected to the @entity7 team			0
waiting game : @entity14 blows a kiss to spectators as she waits for her results after competing in the women 's team short program figure skating competition @entity61 : @entity14 does her routine at her @entity7 debut in @entity5 sparkly : @entity14 donned a bejeweled outfit and performed to @entity66 by @entity67 ' it was on my mind with the media frenzy over the last couple of weeks that i needed to prove to myself and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that i am here to compete , to be competitive , ' she told @entity77			1
the numbers she scored , though , left her visibly disappointed			0
she was left trailing @entity81 's @entity80 in first place , @entity83 of @entity84 in second and @entity85 of @entity86 , who came third despite falling during her routine			2
before the score : wagner waves to the crowd after her performance hopeful : surrounded by teammates and next to her coach , @entity14 waits for the scores second prize : @entity98 's face as she stood to receive her silver medal became infamous more to come : @entity14 says she 's hoping to score better in her individual events her score , however , was enough to advance the @entity2 team from seventh to third place , meaning they will be one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on sunday night			1
her facial expression upon seeing her score is reminiscent of the distinctly unimpressed look gymnast @entity98 wore on the second - place podium during the @entity112			0
@entity98 's visage was captured the public imagination - in other words , it became a meme			0
time will tell if one unguarded facial expression will come to define @entity14 in history more than her figure skating ability .			0

after @entity1 completed her routine for the women 's short program in @entity5 saturday she appeared *pleased*
the figure skater smiled , waved and blew kisses to the crowd
after she received her score , she was less *cheerful* and threw a look of disgust at the judges
her score of 63.10 was enough to get the @entity2 team through to the finals
