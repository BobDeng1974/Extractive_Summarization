@entity64 forecaster , @entity62 described the exact science behind the formations and said it was nature 's version of a snowman			2
' it ’s not a bog standard snow roll , the sort that you might see in snow covered open fields on a windy day , ' she said			0

wintry tumbleweed : they begin with a thick layer of snow , with the top layer just on the point of melting which becomes sticky and can be peeled off the colder and more powdery snow beneath by the wind , forming a roll snow slip : also known as snowrollers , snow bales and snow doughnuts , the phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature , ice , snow , moisture and wind			1
in this case the snow on the roof of the car was dragged down as it curled on the windscreen ' a classic snow roll happens with the combination of lying snow and high wind speeds , mostly in @entity13 and @entity118 , and they can be as small as a tennis ball or as large as two feet across – depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is			1
