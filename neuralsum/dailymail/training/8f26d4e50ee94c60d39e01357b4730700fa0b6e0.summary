record sales of @entity2 ’s @entity1 has helped to , well , save his bacon after a fall in donations to his charitable initiatives			1
the royal ’s charitable foundation was last year gifted more than £ 2.8 million by supermarket @entity9 , who took over the once loss - making @entity12 brand two years ago and have turned it into an international success story			1
in 2011 their total royalties donation was just £ 645,000 - amounting to a staggering 348 per cent increase in just 12 months			2
sales increase : a selection of @entity12 products which are sold at @entity9 it also helped offset a fall in public donations to @entity1 ’s charities , which supports organisations working to combat everything from climate change to youth unemployment , from £ 12.2 million in 2011 to £ 10.5 million last year			1
the donation also meant that the prince was able to invest £ 6.2 million in good causes , up from £ 4.7 million from the previous 12 months			0
@entity12 was set up by @entity1 in 1990 as a means of raising money for deserving causes by selling organic produce grown at his @entity36 estate			2
it quickly branched out , selling everything from bacon to soap , biscuits and cordials , but was hit hard by the recession and at one point saw annual losses of £ 3.3 million			0
in 2010 , however , the prince did a deal with @entity9 , giving it excusive rights to sell the @entity51 range - which has expanded to more than 260 products including a gardening and beauty line - in return for a substantial donation to his charitable foundation initially set at £ 1 million			2
good causes : prince @entity1 , set up @entity12 to raise money for charity , but the brand struggled to make a profit until the supermarket took over benefits for all : thanks to @entity12 ' success sales , @entity9 donated 2.8million to charity in 2012 the range has become a huge success - it now exports to more than 25 countries across the globe including @entity73 and @entity74 - and led to a significant increase in royalties , as revealed in its annual accounts published yesterday			1
@entity78 , managing director of @entity9 , said : ‘ these figures reflect an extremely successful year for @entity12 from @entity9 , meaning that we have significantly exceeded our original £ 1 million commitment ’			1
@entity1 ’s charitable coffers were also swelled by a doubling of the monies raised by opening up the gardens at @entity36 to paying visitors and by selling a range of themed gifts including napkins , boot racks and even gin			0
this leapt from £ 312,000 in 2011 to £ 618,000 last year			0
the accounts also revealed that the @entity95 ’s @entity94 has managed to pay off a controversial £ 20 million loan taken out in 2007 to support the purchase of @entity98 , a stately home in @entity99 with a world - class collection of @entity102 , which is now open to the public			0
@entity1 personally stood by the deal , despite being accused of putting his entire charity empire at risk by taking out such a substantial loan .			0
