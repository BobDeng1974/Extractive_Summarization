by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 12:04 est , 9 january 2014 a hospital has apologised for a ‘ botched ’ operation which left a new mother with a surgical packing ' tampon ' stitched up inside her			1
the woman had given birth at @entity8 but no one realised the surgical material was still in her body when she was helped off the operating table			1
today hospital bosses promised ‘ lessons will be learned ’ from the botched operation , which led to the stitches having to be removed and put back in again after the padding was taken out			2
a woman who gave birth at @entity8 ( pictured ) was left with a surgical padding ' tampon ' stitched up inside her the mistake has been classed as an @entity22 ‘ never event ’ , an incident regarded by the government as so serious they should never happen			1
the event , which occurred on the maternity wing in november , was potentially the most serious to occur in a medical environment , the medical director for the @entity27 , revealed at a board meeting			2
dr @entity32 said : ' this never event occurred at the obstetrics unit when suturing took place after delivery			0
' as part of this process a tampon was used and , regrettably , it was identified as having been left when the patient had been treated			0
' although it was n’t in itself dangerous because it was removed immediately , it was a significant error because had it been left in , it would have caused infection			1
' fortunately , it was resolved within a very short time and the mother suffered no ill - effects			0
the mistake has been classed as an @entity22 ' never event ' , an incident regarded by the government as so serious they should never happen ' she ’s fine and there has been dialogue with the family since this happened			1
' we are still looking at this incident in great depth to discover what led up to it and how we can learn from it			0
' this is very unfortunate and i do agree that the timing is unfortunate in view of the @entity69 report , which was very damning			0
“ it should never have happened at all , but it is the first never event in more than a year .			0
