his mother said the family were anxious about his use of the passport			1
' we talked a lot about this and i said they may realise the age difference between @entity11 and the person on the passport			1
ms @entity14 last spoke to @entity11 on march 7 , about 10 minutes before he headed to @entity48 ' we were basically very nervous			1

a complete blow is how the @entity109 wife of a passenger on board the missing plane described the update			2
@entity114 's mechanical engineer husband @entity113 was on board the ill - fated flight , bound for @entity117 where he was set to start a new job			2
mrs @entity119 said the she was trying to comes to terms with the devastating news that @entity3 is not located in the search area of the @entity123 , but she is still holding hope			1

' i 'm just a wife trying to find her husband ... 77 days on , i still do n't know where he is			0
' on thursday , the @entity131 said that the search in the zone where acoustic pings were detected was finished completed and the area could be ruled out as the resting place of @entity3			1
based on authorities confidence that the pings were the best lead in the search for the missing plane , ms @entity148 said she felt like she had been given false			1
mrs weeks , pictured with husband @entity113 , who was on @entity3 , is still waiting for the truth and said she has some small hope left anticipating the discovery of the wreckage , mrs weeks was organising a memorial for her husband as the search was taking place			2

the @entity148 have two sons together , @entity127 , 3 , and 13 - month - old @entity125 , and since the disappearance of the flight , ms @entity148 has been told by people to tell the young boys the truth			2
' i 'm telling @entity127 the truth that dad is n't coming back and it was n't his choice , ' she said			0
' he 's obviously emotional about that			0

the @entity194 has now expanded the search for @entity3 to a much wider zone using an arc defined by @entity199 company @entity198 based on the final handshakes between the @entity201 and satellites			2

mr @entity210 said it was likely that the linear arc represented the plane 's flight path			0
' the thing that we 're absolutely confident of is somewhere on that long arc we will find the aircraft , ' he said			0
' but , because it 's so long , we have to be able to find a much smaller segment of the arc to concentrate our search and that 's what our analysis is looking at defining			0
' mr @entity210 said authorities were re-analysing satellite data and aircraft performance information to define an area of up to 60,000 square kilometres to search further .			0
