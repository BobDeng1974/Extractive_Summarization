what colour is this dress ? that was the question that sparked a fierce internet debate , with social media users , among them @entity6 and @entity7 , arguing over its true hue			1
now a new photo has emerged that looks set to end the row once and for all , and reveals that those who claimed it was blue and black are correct			1
in the picture , the dress is being worn by @entity17 , the mother of the bride , and is clearly blue and black rather than cream and gold			1
' @entity17 's daughter @entity28 married her husband @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , earlier this month with her mother choosing to wear the Â£ 50 dress from @entity42			1
@entity17 , who lives in @entity43 , had sent @entity28 a picture of the dress which she had then shared online			0
family friend @entity46 , 21 , then posted it to @entity48 after a debate broke out among their friends about what colour the dress was			2
it promptly went viral , with posts arguing over the dress 's original colours - and science behind the debate - viewed and shared millions of times			1
@entity28 's sister @entity61 , 37 , also from @entity43 , said : ' it 's my mum 's dress			2
it was my sister @entity28 's wedding on @entity38			0
' ' @entity66 sent it to @entity28 to give the dress a thumbs up or thumbs down			0
' it was sent originally to my sister then my mum sent the picture to me and @entity28 said ' why is she wearing white and gold to the wedding ? we were shocked my mum had chosen a light coloured dress			1
' @entity61 continued : ' originally i saw it a white and gold			2
@entity28 saw it as white and gold - her fiance saw it as blue and black and they had a bit of a tadoo about it			1
' she continued : ' the actual dress is blue and black			1
only that picture is different			0
' saying their vows : @entity28 married her husband @entity94 in @entity39 earlier this month her family have spoken out about the dress going viral the happy day : one of @entity28 's friends has revealed that she has found the whole experience ' very weird ' after waking up to messages and missed calls about the dress on her honeymoon @entity103 , 26 , also from @entity43 , was a bridesmaid at the wedding			2
she said : ' it 's mental			0
@entity28 showed me the original picture and she thought it was white and gold			2
' then we had the wedding and @entity46 posted it online			0
i ca n't comprehend it			0
for us it was literally like , ' that 's a bit weird ' and that was it			0
' the dress was royal blue and as black as you can get			1
the wedding was brilliant , it was lovely			0
' @entity103 said she had sent a message to @entity28 in @entity123 , who told her she had received lots of missed calls and messages , adding : ' it 's dead weird waking up and seeing my phone has gone mental			0
' @entity94 , the groom , posted to his @entity130 : ' you know it 's gon na be a strange day when you wake up and after 30 seconds of interneting can turn to @entity135 and say ' so @entity7 sees white and gold , but @entity6 sees blue and black			1
' indeed @entity7 and @entity6 did weight in on the debate			1
@entity7 asked her 29.4million @entity140 followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband @entity6			2
unfortunately for @entity7 , @entity6 has been proved correct by the new photo , while she has been left to eat humble pie			1
the astonishing spread of the dress debate has left @entity146 shocked , with the 21 - year - old telling @entity148 that she never expected the photograph to go viral			1
' i thought my followers on @entity48 would maybe have a good reaction but i never would have considered that @entity153 and @entity154 would be tweeting about it			0
' first post : the photo was initially shared by @entity158 , 21 , above , an aspiring singer from @entity39 creating a buzz : @entity7 called on her 29.4million @entity140 followers to help settle a disagreement ' confused and scared ' : @entity153 told her @entity140 followers that the dress is ' obviously blue and black ' star power : celebrities including @entity154 , @entity165 and oscar - winner @entity166 join the debate miss @entity146 also went on to reveal why she posted the snap in the first place and said that the original shot came from mrs @entity17 herself who bought the dress in high - street retailer @entity42			1
' what happened was two of my close friends were actually getting married and the mother of the bride took a photo of the dress to send to her daughter , ' she said			1
' when my friend showed the dress to her fiancee , they disagreed on the colour			0
all of our friends disagreed			0
' with the debate fresh in her mind , miss @entity146 shared the photo on a @entity48 fan page dedicated to a talent manager @entity193			2
then , without @entity193 promoting the post or realising it was there , it went viral , with scores of celebrities getting involved in the argument			0
@entity7 said : ' what color is that dress ? i see white & gold			1
@entity6 sees black & blue , who is color blind ? ' actress @entity154 also joined the discussion , writing on @entity140 : ' it 's a blue and black dress ! @entity208 '			1
even more colors : the dress can also be purchased in white and black or a pink and black combination true colors : the dress , made by the company @entity42 , is in fact blue and black striped her friend and fellow actor @entity165 replied with a succinct post that simply read : ' white and gold			1
' then recent @entity223 winner @entity166 jumped in , writing to @entity165 and @entity154 to complain : ' what 's the matter with u guys , it 's white and gold			1
' to that , @entity165 replied to @entity166 ; ' thank you ! and congratulations on your @entity223 , which @entity154 thinks is purple and green			0
' @entity153 wrote ; ' i do n't understand this odd dress debate and i feel like it 's a trick somehow			1
i 'm confused and scared			0
@entity235 it 's obviously blue and black			2
' and @entity237 kept his fans happy by telling them , correctly as it turns out , that he sees ' blue and black '			2
some celebrities avoided the issue completely and contented themselves by simply declaring the dress ugly			0
model @entity243 told her 655,000 @entity140 followers : ' f * * * the dress it 's heinous ' , while oscar - winner @entity249 branded it ' fugly '			2
with the release of the new photo , the bodycon dress , which is made by @entity251 company @entity42 , has been definitively identified as being black and blue			1
there company also makes also white , pink and red options , all with black lace			2
there are , however , no white and gold versions to be had			2
on display : the dress is displayed in the window of the @entity266 , it also comes in different colours trying it on : a woman tried on the dress in the store today showing it to be blue and black there 's science behind the reason why some people see black on blue while others are just as certain that they see gold on white			1
the simple answer is that the picture is an optical illusion			0
objects reflect light at certain wavelengths , or colors , and the human brain determines the color of an object by taking in its reflected light			0
but this perception can be thrown off balance by the color of nearby objects			0
with the photo of the dress , the surrounding colors are so muddled that the brain is n't sure what to make of the dress itself			0
as @entity305 points out , a digital analysis of the dress photo shows that one of the spots of black trim is actually orange in the photo			1
thus , people who perceive the surrounding area as dark are likely to see the blue in the dress as white and the black colors as gold			1
it all just depends on the manner that the brain perceives and processes color			0
@entity321 , a university of of @entity324 neuroscience tells @entity325 : ' i 've studied individual differences in color vision for 30 years , and this is one of the biggest individual differences i 've ever seen			0
' he sees gold on white .			0

colours of two - tone dress have become a topic of debate on social media
some viewers see the bodycon dress as white with gold lace *detailing*
others see royal blue with black while a few *insist* the colours change
@entity6 *insist*ed it was blue and black - and it seems he 's correct
