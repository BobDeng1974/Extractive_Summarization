@entity3 3 - 0 @entity2 - read @entity1 's match report @entity4 impresses - player ratings @entity6 : winning @entity7 is the priority sometimes it is n’t easy to understand @entity10 , and we ’re not just talking about those occasions when he compares @entity7 ties to ‘ death or the gladiolus ’ or complains about back - fours ‘ twitching my ass ’			1
the temptation has been to not question a man with his wealth of football experience who has coached some of the best teams and best players in the world			2
after all , @entity26 knows best			0
but there have been times in his first seven months at @entity30 when @entity6 has left us scratching our heads ; times when it all seems to be coming together , when formations are starting to make sense and players are building momentum , when he will appear to rip it up and start again			1
@entity10 mixed up his tactics again as @entity3 hosted @entity2 on tuesday night @entity40 netted the final goal of the evening as @entity3 advanced to the @entity7 fifth round with a 3 - 0 win @entity44 was perhaps unlucky not to be selected on tuesday after starting to show his promise so it was that we arrived at @entity30 on tuesday night to find that @entity3 had made five changes for the @entity7 fourth round replay against @entity2 that brought a predictable home win			1
nothing strange in that , you might say			0
@entity6 is desperate to win this competition and it probably made sense to freshen things up after saturday ’s win over @entity59 here , although it was surprising to see @entity44 left out altogether after the teenager had begun to show some of his old promise			0
one look at @entity6 ’s teamsheet immediately raised questions about how @entity3 would line up , however			1
with the exception of @entity68 , it was as if the manager had picked all his tallest players to counter the aerial threat from their @entity73 opponents			0
no pun intended , but surely @entity3 should be bigger than that ? while fine in theory , the 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation had @entity78 operating on the right and @entity4 on the left			1
then the big @entity81 began to drift forward as the first half wore and ended up almost as a target man , knocking the ball down for @entity68 ’s opening goal			0
it was as if @entity3 were trying to beat @entity87 at their own game			1
@entity4 played in a forward role and knocked the ball down for @entity68 to finish @entity78 was unusually played out on the right and was tasked with crossing for @entity4 and co it worked , and @entity6 would be justified in saying that he picked a team to do a job			1
but @entity97 pundit @entity96 was not the only one to be a little perplexed			0
‘ what an odd , odd system from @entity6 , ’ he said			0
‘ what an odd way to put out a team with the players you ’ve got			0
@entity4 on the left wing and @entity78 on the right ? really ? does that fit ? ‘ why is he even out there , @entity78 ? sir @entity108 used to play him there , but only when they were up against the likes of @entity113 and @entity114			1
if i was a player playing for @entity3 i would be absolutely deflated			1
if i was @entity78 playing out wide against @entity87 , i would wonder what on earth the manager was doing with me			2
what am i doing out here ? it ’s just crazy			0
’ @entity120 saw it a little differently			0
‘ the positions of @entity4 and @entity78 are interesting tonight , not the usual positions you 'd expect to see them in , ’ said the @entity123 expert			1
‘ @entity78 wide right in possession but then tucking in when defending , and @entity4 playing up front to the left of @entity130 where he played at times under @entity132 at @entity133			1
‘ @entity132 never did that at @entity3 with @entity4 as he maybe felt he ’d be criticised even though at times i think he should of but , @entity136 does n’t seem to worry about other opinions and does what he thinks is right – so he should considering his cv ! ’ @entity132 may have been tempted to use @entity4 from the left , but he might have felt he 'd be criticised @entity6 wo n't care what pundits like @entity120 and @entity96 think too true			1
@entity6 wo n’t give a fig what the likes of @entity96 and @entity120 think			0
from the moment he walked into @entity30 , the @entity146 has been determined to do things his way			2
sometimes it makes sense , sometimes not			0
his devotion to a three - man defence , for instance , has been puzzling			2
the players are clearly uncomfortable with it and that invites pressure from opponents			0
@entity6 has spoken about ‘ coaching the players minds ’ so they can adapt to different situations , but the @entity163 are n’t @entity146 and @entity164 is not something that can be learned overnight			0
the fans have voiced their opposition to a system that is so foreign to @entity3 ’s 4 - 4 - 2 ethos , and @entity170 is not alone in pointing out that it curbs the team ’s attacking verve			1
@entity174 has been on the bench since netting a stunning goal for @entity3 against @entity177 then there is @entity6 ’s treatment of certain players			2
he is not one to care for reputations but the way he has handled @entity183 has brought public criticism from the striker ’s agent @entity185 , long considered to be a friend of the club			0
@entity174 ’s reward for breaking the deadlock at @entity191 in the third round with a cracking goal was to be left out of the starting line - up for the last five games			2
@entity44 is the latest to find out that a good performance is no guarantee of a place in the team			2
ultimately , @entity6 is experienced enough to know that he will be judged on results			0
if he delivers a @entity203 place and , who knows , the @entity7 this season then no - one is going to quibble about how he did it			1
@entity3 beat @entity87 comfortably and will fancy their chances of doing the same to @entity206 in the fifth round			1
for now , it ’s the gladiolus not death			2
as @entity6 's ( pictured with @entity213 ) side keeps winning , for now , it 's the gladiolus not death			1

@entity3 beat @entity2 3 - 0 at @entity30 on tuesday
@entity216 advanced to the @entity7 fifth round after *victory*
@entity10 's continues to mix up his tactics
@entity4 and @entity78 played on opposite wings
for now , it 's the gladiolus not death
