as @entity1 walks into @entity3 ’s plush training ground reception on monday afternoon , he is surrounded by scouts			1
there ’s an under 21 match against @entity7 about to kick off ; spies from across the country have made their way to @entity3 ’ @entity11 with a view to picking up a little gem ahead of next week ’s transfer deadline			1
there was a time , not too long ago , when @entity1 would have been the subject of such attention			1
@entity1 is gearing up for wednesday night 's @entity19 clash against @entity20 @entity1 has come a long way from the player who appeared to be on his way out at @entity3 the winger scored the only goal of the first leg against @entity27 's @entity29 blades having spent no less than nine loan periods away from @entity32 , there was a time when this talented winger wondered if he would ever make the grade at the club he supported as a boy			1
now he is on the brink of a @entity40 cup final as @entity3 take a slender 1 - 0 advantage to @entity20 tonight in their @entity19 semi-final second - leg clash			1
he ’s certainly come a long way			2
heralded as @entity45 ’s next superstar in october 2013 after scoring on his international debut against @entity47 , @entity1 is now desperate to make his first @entity40 appearance as a club footballer			1
and as we sit , after monday ’s training session , looking ahead to wednesday 's encounter the topic of his progress since that dazzling international debut is broached			0
how does @entity1 feel about his development since the euphoria of a man - of - the - match display on his @entity45 bow ? @entity1 - photographed by @entity60 on monday - has struggled with injuries throughout his career his response : ‘ i ’ve spoken a lot about this before , and i do n’t really want to go through it again			1
‘ i ’ll go through it briefly			0
i got injuries at the worst times - i got injured three or four games after making my @entity45 debut			1
‘ hopefully now i ’m on the road back			0
i ’m back in the @entity3 side , playing reasonably well and back to where i want to be			1
’ it was a somewhat frosty reply			0
but to be fair , he has a point			0
an ankle injury cruelly denied him the chance of going to the @entity77 in the summer , while this season has been disrupted by thigh and further ankle problems			0
likewise , he was a peripheral figure during the opening weeks of @entity83 ’s reign ; in and out of the @entity85 ’s plans			0
slowly but surely , though , he has proved his worth to his manager and is back in the side - a shock start against @entity90 last month proving the catalyst in a resurgence			0
‘ the biggest confidence booster for me was against @entity20 , when the manager threw me in , ’ revealed @entity1			1
@entity1 scored @entity3 's goal during the @entity97 fourth round defeat against @entity7 on saturday ‘ we have a meeting in the morning of games where the manager says the team ; it was unexpected so i could n’t wait to get going			1
‘ i had n’t started in the @entity103 for a month or so and we did well that game			0
after that we beat @entity105 so that gave me a big confidence boost			0
’ but what does he have to do to ensure he stays a fixture in @entity83 ’s starting xi ? despite his rapid progress over the past 18 months , doubts over @entity1 ’s end product continue to linger			1
‘ of course there are areas of my game i still need to work on , ’ admitted the winger			2
‘ it ’s no secret i have to improve my assist and goal ratio - that ’s what i ’m solely focusing on			2
‘ i do n’t listen to critics but you know in yourself what you need to improve			2
i analyse every match i play so i know my good points and bad points			0
‘ i do n’t take notice of stats , in a game you could put five great crosses in but no one gets on the end of it and you do n’t get an assist			0
’ an area of his game that does n’t need improvement , however , is his accuracy from the spot			0
@entity1 impressed and scored on his @entity45 debut against @entity47 last season @entity1 's progress at international level was curtailed by injury somewhat all five of his goals this season have come from 12 yards and he looks to have taken over from @entity149 as the club ’s first - choice penalty taker			1
‘ you have to zone out , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ pick your side , do n’t change your mind , focus on what side you want to put it , do n’t look at the keeper - just solely on the ball			0
’ his penalty in the first leg at @entity32 could yet prove the pivotal moment in his side ’s semi-final against the @entity164			1
but @entity1 is refusing to allow himself to dream of @entity40 ahead of wednesday 's @entity19 showdown			1
@entity1 says he picks a spot and sticks with it when taking a penalty for @entity3 ‘ we ca n’t think about @entity40			1
it ’s great to be in the semi-final , but being a semi-final loser is the worse place to be			2
‘ i ’ve never played there as club player			0
i was part of the 19 - man squad for the @entity97 semi-final against @entity179 in 2010 , but they wanted me there for the experience			2
‘ i went there as a fan in the 2008 @entity19 final we won and the one we lost the year after			2
‘ i ’d go with my dad , brother and sister , it was a great occasion for the family			0
‘ so to have the chance to go as a player is a dream come true			0
’ ‘ @entity1 was speaking ahead of the second leg of the @entity195 on behalf of @entity19 – the card in your corner			1

@entity3 travel to @entity20 in the @entity19 semi-final
@entity1 scored the only goal of the first leg against the @entity164
