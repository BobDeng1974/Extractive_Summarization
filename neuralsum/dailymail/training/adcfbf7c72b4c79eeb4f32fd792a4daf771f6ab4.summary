for all its wealth and influence , football suffers from a host of self - made problems			2
yet the national game offers many more reasons to celebrate than to curse			2
which is something to remember when we contemplate the misadventures of the bewildered clown named @entity12			1
by now , we can almost recite his odious stereotyping : ‘ do you think @entity18 people chase money a little bit more than we do ? ... it ’s telling the truth			1
@entity18 people love money ... if any @entity24 said he has never called a @entity25 a chink he is lying ... there ’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something i would never ever do or agree to			1
i would never even dream of that ... i go to @entity32 a lot			1
’ it is the kind of grotesque drivel which renders satire redundant			2
and it faithfully echoes the attitudes of the man whom @entity12 appointed to manage @entity38			1
for by now we have become wretchedly acquainted with the musings of @entity40			1
@entity12 ( right ) and new @entity38 boss @entity40 are of one mind on a @entity48 footballer : ‘ * * * chinkys			1
there ’s enough dogs in @entity46 for us all to go around			1
’ on the football agent @entity49 : ‘ go on , fat @entity50 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers			2
’ on a football official : ‘ he ’s a snake , a gay snake			1
’ on a female agent : ‘ i hope she ’s looking after your needs			1
i bet you ’d love a bounce on her falsies			2
’ all this , plus the distribution of a picture entitled ‘ @entity67 ’ , with every square marked ‘ @entity69 ’			2
the episode has erupted at a turbulent time , when the game is distracted by issues ranging from @entity75 corruption , to @entity76 , to the re-emergence of a hard - right strand among @entity24 supporters			2
and it embodies the attitude which insists that football is entitled to live by its own standards , regardless of the views of the outside world			1
thus , @entity40 can send messages to a chum at another club , in the knowledge that they hold common assumptions about @entity18 , foreigners , women and gays			1
the fact that non-football people might find such views grossly offensive has clearly never crossed his mind			1
you see , we ’re all lads together here			2
nudge - nudge , wink - wink , quality banter			0
yet this is the character @entity12 chose to manage his club , on the extraordinary grounds that ‘ what he ’s done is so tiny , really ... it ’s not all that serious when you read it			1
’ and he awarded him the job in the full knowledge that the @entity113 were inquiring into @entity40 ’s behaviour			1
@entity40 patrols the touchline on his return to football , despite being under investigation from the @entity113 imagine somebody applying for a post as the manager of one of @entity12 ’s sports shops and admitting that the authorities were still inquiring into his previous conduct			1
would @entity12 say : ‘ not a problem , son			1
’ ? of course not			0
but he can do precisely that at @entity38 , because it does n’t really count			0
they were in the process of offering @entity40 a position at @entity140 , but negotiations were swiftly broken off when the sexist , racist , homophobic revelations appeared			1
are the people who run @entity136 more principled than those who run @entity38 ? it would seem so			1
football ’s freemasonry being what it is , both @entity12 and @entity40 found support within the game			1
one @entity151 manager declared @entity12 ‘ a good man ’ , and said of @entity40 : ‘ it ’s easy to kick someone when they ’re down ... if he does it again , he ’s gon na be in trouble , but i ’m sure he ’s learned from that			1
he ’s made a big mistake , the lad			1
’ if @entity163 is the best advocate @entity12 and @entity40 can find , then their cause may well be hopeless			1
@entity40 still seems incapable of appreciating the offence he has given			1
‘ i ’m a big man , ’ he said , as he took up his new job			0
‘ i would ask people to judge me as they see me			1
i made mistakes but i ’m absolutely not racist			0
i hope going forward the people of @entity38 see me as i am			1
’ @entity169 revealed the ' racist , homophobic and sexist ' texts and emails by @entity40 and @entity172 ( left ) the people of @entity38 may do just that , and he may not care for their conclusions			1
as for @entity12 , he simply blunders on ; a contemptible figure whose image degenerates each time he opens his mouth			1
some have tried to excuse him on the grounds that he is an old man who comes from a different , more bigoted era			1
but he has been talking offensive nonsense for a number of years now , and he shows no signs of changing			1
he clearly does n’t believe that @entity40 has done anything particularly untoward , and in @entity12 ’s world , he probably has n’t			1
for this is football , where such attitudes are condoned and tolerated , sometimes even celebrated			0
yet , by the week ’s end , even @entity12 seemed to tire of his own prattling			1
he is aware of the @entity113 investigations into the affair , but he affects an airy indifference			0
‘ i do n’t think there is anything really to investigate ’ , he says			0
‘ i just want to get on with the great game			0
’ the @entity113 may have other ideas ; if so , they would be widely supported			0
for the football people of @entity38 deserve rather better than @entity12 and @entity40			1
and so does the national sport			0
@entity76 posturing absurd many are split over @entity76 ' future some believe that the rapist @entity76 should once again be allowed to train with his club			1
others , this column included , contend his offence was so grave that he should find no immediate place in professional sport			2
both arguments have much to commend them but people must adopt one or the other , or risk appearing ridiculous			2
which brings us to @entity215 , the co-chairman of @entity216			0
speaking after his club had withdrawn training facilities from @entity76 , he said : ‘ i ’m angry that we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done			2
the influence of mob - like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing @entity76 to train			0
@entity76 was convicted and has served his sentence			0
‘ he now has a right and an obligation to go about making a livelihood			0
’ all of which is admirably high - sounding and thoroughly misleading			0
@entity76 has served only the custodial portion of his five - year sentence			0
he is now paroled under licence conditions			0
but if @entity216 wanted him to resume training and ultimately playing , then they would be entitled to make that judgement			0
and if they recognise his ‘ right and obligation ’ to resume his livelihood , they have only to say the word			0
the fact is , they are afraid to take those steps because they know they will prove unpopular			2
and so their co-chairman pretends they had no choice			0
few people can claim credit from the @entity76 affair			2
after the posturing of @entity215 , @entity216 can claim less than most			0
@entity216 co-chairman @entity215 speaks to the assembled media this week about @entity76 silence is sweet music in a good few years of watching sport , i have yet to meet a fan who bought a ticket to look at the audience			0
when people pay for a sports event , they do so in order to observe the players			2
this simple truth is something which escapes certain groups : cricket ’s so - called @entity272 , for instance , or that dreadful band whose dreary thumping forms the background to far too many @entity24 football matches			2
certain @entity24 cricket grounds have evolved ways of dealing with the attention - seeking ‘ @entity282 ’ , by refusing entry on the grounds that they make life hell for anybody within hearing distance			2
the @entity272 in action during @entity24 's successful @entity291 tour three years ago yet at least their songs are largely inoffensive			0
the characters who have latched on to @entity24 football ’s band are a different matter			2
personally , i have always believed that anybody who turns up carrying a musical instrument should be turned away			0
this would deny us endless , artless repetitions of the national anthem , or @entity306 or , @entity307 help us , @entity308			0
but we could live with that			0
for it would also deny some unsavoury individuals the chance to infect sport with crass slogans , by bawling @entity316 chants and singing provocative songs			0
in @entity319 the other evening , an @entity113 official was obliged to ask the band to stop playing , since their ‘ music ’ was unwittingly fuelling certain sectarian anthems			0
they instantly complied and the silence was golden			0
with luck , it will never be broken			0
@entity327 the @entity329 haka — the pre-match war dance performed by the @entity329 — was one of those strangely endearing cultural traditions which was always watched with respect by opponents and spectators			0
then we were told that somehow it gave @entity329 an unfair advantage			0
at the recent @entity340 international , the home crowd drowned the haka with wave after boorish wave of @entity343			0
so it was good to hear the @entity346 wing @entity347 speak up for tradition before saturday ’s international			2
@entity349 leads the @entity329 players as they perform the haka at the @entity351 ‘ i ca n’t wait to face the haka again , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s supposed to be intimidating , but if you ca n’t handle it , then you ’re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either ’			1
long may it continue .			0
