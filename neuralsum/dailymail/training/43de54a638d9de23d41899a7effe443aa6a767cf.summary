an experimental @entity3 vaccine appears safe and triggered signs of immune protection in the first 20 volunteers to test it , @entity1 researchers reported wednesday			1
the vaccine is designed to spur the immune system 's production of @entity12 antibodies , and people developed them within four weeks of getting the shots at the @entity16			1
half of the test group received a higher - dose shot , and those people produced more antibodies , said the study published in the @entity23			1

' seems to work ' : the first participant enrolled in an investigational @entity3 vaccine at the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 the vaccine now appears safe and triggered signs of immune protection in the first 20 volunteers to test it , @entity1 researchers reported wednesday stimulating both types of immune response is ' a promising factor ' , said dr. @entity43 , director of @entity16 's @entity44 , whose employees led the work			1
the researchers reported no serious side effects			0
but two people who received the higher - dose vaccine briefly spiked fevers — one above 103 degrees — which disappeared within a day			1
earlier this month , @entity43 told @entity52 this first - stage testing was promising enough that the @entity1 planned much larger studies in @entity55 , starting in @entity56 in early january , to try to prove whether the vaccine really works			1
scientists are racing to develop ways to prevent or treat the virus that has killed more than 5,600 people in @entity55 , most of them in @entity62 , @entity56 and @entity63			2
wednesday 's publication offered scientific details about the initial testing of the vaccine candidate furthest along , one being developed by @entity16 and @entity68			1
