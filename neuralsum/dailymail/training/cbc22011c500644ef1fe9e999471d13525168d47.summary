by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 19:06 est , 8 december 2012 the problems started a couple of months after @entity3 gave birth to her second son			1
‘ the first thing i noticed was some discomfort , but when i pressed on my tummy i could feel a lump – it was about the size of a ping - pong ball , ’ recalls the 39 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity8			1
‘ obviously , i was worried – when you find a lump you instantly think cancer			2
’ her gp referred her to an @entity20 gynaecologist , who said it was likely to be nothing but that it should be removed and tested to make sure			2
‘ they said this operation would allow them to make a proper diagnosis , ’ says @entity3			1
there would be a three - month wait to have surgery on the @entity20 – but in 2010 , @entity3 had taken out private health insurance with @entity31			1
‘ i was pleased i ’d finally get to use it , and hoped i could be seen in a matter of weeks			2
that ’s why you take out these policies , ’ she says			2
anger : @entity3 , pictured with her sons @entity39 and @entity40 , fought against her private health insurance company for six months over compensation @entity3 contacted @entity31 , and during a conversation with a telephone operator mentioned that she had suffered from endometriosis in the past – a common condition that causes growths around the uterus			1
this admission triggered a chain of events that led to her claim being held up for six months , and ultimately being turned down			1
she managed to have the decision reversed – but only on the night before her operation			2
@entity3 says the whole experience was ‘ incredibly stressful ’ and made her question why she ’d bothered to pay into a policy in the first place			1
and hers is not an isolated case			2
a perfect storm is brewing in @entity64 ’s £ 5 billion - a - year private medical insurance industry			1
premiums are rising , policyholder numbers are falling – and complaints about high charges and poor service have triggered an official investigation by watchdogs the @entity72			0
health how - to : make sure you are not caught unawares by the small print of your health insurance policy in theory , private medical insurance allows you to avoid @entity20 waiting lists and get treated where , when and by whom you choose , ideally in your own room at a private hospital or on a private @entity20 ward			1
but cover is being reduced on every type of policy			0
those with comprehensive plans are being hit as firms slash the amount they pay surgeons for carrying out popular procedures			1
a year ago @entity94 paid private doctors up to £ 761 per eye for cataract surgery			1
today it ’s £ 289			0
it means many top surgeons are no longer available to @entity94 customers			0
if policyholders want to see them , they have to pay the difference			1
the @entity105 has seen a surge in complaints from policyholders over shrinking lists of approved surgeons and hospitals , rising premiums and the availability of new or ‘ experimental ’ cancer drugs			0
there are many arguments over the small print that governs what will and wo n’t be covered			0
in @entity3 ’s case , it was her honesty about having suffered a possibly related pre-existing condition that caused her problems			1
she says : ‘ in the months after my first conversation with a telephone operator , i called at least eight times , always having to start from the beginning with someone new			0
‘ they said they covered only diagnostic procedures , which this was			0
but because i ’d mentioned my pre-existing condition , they said the op was a treatment for that , which would n’t be covered			1
in fact , the doctors just did n’t know what the lump was , and all this time i was worried and in pain			0
they told me “ we have to be careful of fraudulent claims ” , which made me even more angry			0
’ in the end @entity3 , 39 , who lives with her husband @entity146 and two boys , @entity40 , four , and nine - month - old @entity39 , turned to their insurance broker , which called @entity31 on her behalf and got approval for the procedure			1
then , in september , two days before her operation , the insurer called again to say her claim had been declined			1
‘ i ’d mentioned the position of the lump – close to my caesarean scar – to their rep. the guy explained that it had been decided the problem was related to the birth , and therefore not covered			2
they ’d only got all this information because i was honest when answering questions			0
’ @entity3 went back to her broker , who successfully intervened a second time , and the operation went ahead			1
‘ i got the green light the night before the op. the lump was benign , but the whole process was utterly stressful			0
’ @entity175 , of medical insurance broker @entity176 in @entity177 , helped @entity3 get her claim paid			1
he says her case shows how important it is to have someone on your side in the event of a dispute			0
‘ brokers can be your advocate and should have the contacts and the inside knowledge to pursue your claim effectively , ’ he explains			2
@entity191 , at @entity31 says : ‘ we try to make every claim as smooth as possible but sometimes we need extra information from policyholders and professionals so claims ca n’t always be agreed in a single phone conversation			1
however , in this instance our claims process was not up to its usual high standards for which we are very sorry			0
’ if you do n’t have access to an independent broker , the best advice is to be cautious when you contact your insurer and to simply read out the details on your referral rather than talking to – and risking getting tripped up by – the phone operator			0
the world of health insurance has become a minefield			1
to help , we have quizzed insurance insiders , doctors and patients to take the temperature of an industry on the edge of a crisis			2
plenty of @entity64 say private medical insurance has saved their lives			1
access to the right specialists at the right time can make any premiums worth paying			0
but critics say policies promise more than they deliver , with confusing small print			0
so how do you choose and make the best of a private provider ? no cover : cystic fibrosis sufferer @entity233 @entity233 knows that claiming on private medical insurance wo n’t be easy – because it ’s been hard enough getting quotes in the first place			1
@entity233 , 26 , is an it technologist for a mortgage company in @entity241			0
he ’s fit and healthy – but because he has cystic fibrosis , policies are only ever offered on special terms			0
he says : ‘ the big providers such as @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity94 wo n’t cover anything related to that pre-existing condition			1
' i ’m happy using the @entity20 to keep my @entity251 in check but i ’m concerned that any illness or disease in later life wo n’t be covered because of it			0
’ most insurers say pre-existing conditions can start to be covered after at least two problem - free years			1
as something like @entity251 may require changing treatment , it may never lose its ‘ pre-existing ’ tag			2
@entity233 is now discussing policies with an independent broker – and experts say he is right to get help			0
‘ nowadays it is all but impossible for consumers to make a reliable comparison when they buy private medical insurance			1
it is complicated at the best of times and individual medical circumstances add a further layer of complexity , ’ says broker @entity175			0
paying out : @entity277 @entity277 , 45 , made a successful claim for foot surgery via @entity247 in 2011 , and chose a surgeon who had performed a metatarsal operation for @entity282			2
@entity277 ’s operation was a success and she was soon back at work promoting @entity287 ’s museums to tourists			0
but her policy stopped paying out when she reached the £ 1,000 limit for physiotherapy , even though she needed four extra sessions at £ 90 a time			0
private prescriptions were n’t covered either so @entity277 , left , spent almost £ 100 on painkillers			2
@entity295 of @entity297 financial advisers , says : ‘ insurers put a lot of emphasis on the things they cover and skate over the things they do n’t			0
' as a consumer you need to think about the full picture when you decide on a policy			0

@entity3 , 39 , had private health insurance but found it difficult to claim compensation
@entity31 claimed that @entity3 *'s* condition was pre-existing as well as a result of child - birth and refused to pay
