@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes he has come of age as @entity3 prepare for what could be the defining moment of their @entity7 campaign			1
@entity0 does not grab too many headlines , with the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 for international company , but there 's no denying the effective role he plays in @entity17 's side			1
the 25 - year - old 's game is to break up attacks and get his team moving forward , and it is a role which has gradually won over @entity22 fans after what he admits was a tricky start to @entity27 life following his Â£ 15million transfer from @entity29 in 2012			2
@entity0 and @entity11 train on wednesday ahead of @entity3 ' crucial qualifier against @entity32 on friday @entity0 faces the media ahead of @entity17 's side clash against the group leaders ' i look back to my first season at @entity1 and i was disappointed with the way i approached it at times , ' @entity0 said			1
' but the last couple of seasons i have certainly learned a lot and improved from that point of view and having those experiences			2
' i understand now i have experienced a lot of highs in my career but unfortunately there are times when you will have some lows			0
' my dip in form affected my confidence and it was the first time i had experienced that at club level			0
' at @entity29 it had always been progress really so it was a bit of a setback , but i came through it			0
as well as holding down a regular place in the @entity1 team in recent months , @entity0 sees himself as a mainstay of a @entity3 side which has started the @entity66 qualifiers so impressively			1
@entity0 is enjoying a run in the @entity1 side and has impressed during the club 's resurgence in recent months wales remain unbeaten after four games with an eight - point haul , but they face a serious examination of their qualification credentials against an @entity32 side top of the group with an unblemished 100 per cent record , ' i have turned 25 now so i do n't consider myself a young player any more , ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity3 ' trip to what is expected to be a hostile @entity82 in @entity83 on saturday night			1
' i have got enough experience both at club and international level to feel a big part of the squad			2
' the experience i have had in the past will hold me in good stead going forward in international football			2
' i am getting towards my peak and i hope to keep improving in the next few years and getting better			0
' the @entity3 midfielder admits that he found it difficult during his first season at @entity1 wales have not been in such a promising position to end their long wait for a major tournament finals appearance since going close to earning a place at @entity102			1
on that occasion @entity3 lost a play - off to @entity105 and @entity0 , then a 13 - year - old schoolboy , admits the disappointment of that near - miss resonates with a lot of the current squad			1
' i was at the @entity105 game as my school used to go to the @entity113 , ' @entity0 said			1
' i remember the disappointment of that night coming so close as do a lot of the lads			0
it is extra motivation for us			0
' for youngsters and supporters to have experienced that we want to be the group to get there			0
' we feel we are getting back to that level , we have quality and much more strength in depth than we have had in the past			0
