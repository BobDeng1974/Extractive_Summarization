husbands who refuse to pay the divorce settlements they owe their ex-wives should be banned from driving , travelling abroad and even given court - enforced curfews , @entity1 legal advisers said yesterday			1
specially - appointed judges should also have the power to order banks and @entity10 to tell the courts how much money reluctant ex-husbands really earn , they recommended			2
curfews on men who wo n't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day – and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags			1
driving bans could last as long as a year			1
around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in @entity25 and @entity26 every year , and they feature in three out of four divorce cases the sweeping sanctions were put forward by the @entity29 , a body led by an appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms			1
in a paper yesterday it said that it was time ' to bring pressure to bear on those who refuse to meet their obligations under a family financial order			1
' it added that making husbands pay would save the state many millions of pounds in welfare payments			1
single - parent families left behind after divorce often rely on benefits and other welfare services			1
around 90,000 family financial orders are made by the courts in @entity25 and @entity26 every year , and they feature in three out of four divorce cases			1
the orders set out what the wealthier former spouse or civil partner – most often the husband – must pay to support his former wife to meet her needs and maintain her living standards			2
the orders also regularly include support for children			2
but , the @entity29 said , husbands frequently fail to comply with the orders either because they ca n't pay or they wo n't pay			1
making them pay is complicated , bewildering and expensive , and often efforts to do so do not work			0
the only punishment the courts can impose is prison – but sending a husband to jail for as long as six months requires criminal standards of proof that are hard to establish , the consultation paper said			0
the sweeping sanctions were put forward by the @entity29 , a body led by an appeal judge which supplies ministers with proposals on necessary legal reforms ( headquarters pictured ) the @entity29 said the solution was to force men to pay by using ' sanctions that are designed to be coercive and not punitive – the threat of these sanctions ought to be enough in many cases to encourage compliance			1
' it called for a new power for courts to impose ' disqualification from foreign travel ' orders which would stop an errant husband from taking a foreign holiday or going abroad on business for 12 months			1
unpaid wives should also be able to apply for their former husband to be banned from driving , the @entity29 said			1
the paper said : ' it would not be used in a way that would unduly impact on the debtor 's ability to earn a living as that would defeat the whole point of the order			0
however , we think that used appropriately , it could be an effective method of influencing ' wo n't pay ' debtors			0
' curfews , the document suggested , would keep an individual who failed to pay in one place specified by a court for between two and 12 hours a day			2
' there would have to be arrangements for electronic tagging , ' it said			0
to tell the difference between what the @entity29 termed ' ca n't pay ' and ' won ' t pay ' debtors , the paper said the courts should be able to apply to @entity10 for information about employment and earnings			1
similar orders would force banks and building societies to give up information about accounts			0
such powers are already on the statute book to make people pay court and tribunal compensation awards			0
but they have never been put into use			2
the information gathered could be passed on to wives who are owed money , the @entity29 said			1
' on the one hand , this intrudes on the privacy of the debtor and offends the idea of the parties moving on and living separate lives , which is an aspiration of the law in this area , ' it said			0
' on the other hand , it may be the most effective use of the information and family law creditors are likely to already have some knowledge of the debtor 's personal circumstances			0
' the paper also said that specially - trained judges should be appointed in every family court to make and supervise the enforcement procedures			0
curfews on men who wo n't pay their debts to their former wives could compel them to stay at home for as long as 12 hours a day – and would be enforced by making them wear electronic tags the law commissioner who produced the paper , professor @entity172 , said : ' the law governing the enforcement of family financial orders is hard to understand and difficult to use			2
' when the courts can not enforce family financial orders , it can lead to real hardship for former partners and children and place a huge burden on the state			0
' we need to understand whether existing mechanisms for enforcement are working as well as they might , what other powers the courts might use to tackle non-payment , and how we can find better solutions for couples when one partner is able to pay but refuses to do so			0
' some family lawyers were doubtful that driving and travel bans and curfews would work			1
@entity196 , a family lawyer with @entity198 solicitors , said : ' were these measures to be adopted , this would demonstrate that the courts are not afraid to flex their muscles			0
' however , it is worth remembering that even though this would be a robust initiative , these measures would still only be deterrents designed to intimidate but lacking redress			0
clients pursuing outstanding sums do n't really care whether their ex has to be in bed early , ca n't drive or travel abroad			2
what they really want is the prospect of financial relief and that is what is missing here			0
' the use of curfews and electronic tagging to discipline former husbands and wives was first proposed by @entity223 's government a decade ago			1
the plan was to penalise thousands of mothers who refuse to let divorced or separated fathers see their children in defiance of court orders			2
but the idea was dropped amid fears of a backlash if many thousands of single mothers were tagged .			0
