by @entity1 reporter published : 02:51 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 19 june 2013 @entity2 may be better known for its glaciers and forests than for its beaches , but this week residents of the icy state have been soaking up the sun during a freak heatwave			1
@entity10 , the state 's biggest city , has seen record temperatures of @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , while other parts of @entity2 are believed to have climbed as high as @entity16			1
however , while many are delighted by the unusual warmth , others are sweltering in homes and offices which lack air - conditioning and are not designed to tackle heat			0
18 - year - old @entity40 , who joined hundreds relaxing on the shore of @entity27 , commented : ' i love it - i 've never seen a summer like this , ever			2
' but others were less positive - @entity10 resident @entity47 said , ' it 's almost unbearable to me			1
i do n't like being hot			0
' state officials took the unusual step of warning people that they should wear sunscreen if they go outside			0
spectacular : a sunbather lies back on the beach as a plane comes in to land at @entity10 airport the @entity59 temperature officially recorded in @entity10 yesterday is the highest ever seen on that date , while other places saw even more extreme spikes			1
the small town of @entity64 near @entity65 saw an official peak of @entity67 , and a lodge nearby apparently measured @entity16 - equalling the highest temperature ever recorded in @entity2			1
' this is the hottest heat wave in @entity2 since 1969 , ' said meteorolist @entity71			2
' you 're way , way from normal			0
' the heat wave also comes after a few cooler summers - the last time it officially hit the 80 mark in @entity10 was 2009			1
bonanza : @entity78 with the last fan available for sale at the @entity81 in @entity10 the wave has brought a bonanza for stores selling summer supplies - the @entity81 had run out of fans , and was selling five times the usual amount of mosquito repellent			2
' those are two hot items , so to speak , ' store owner @entity78 joked			0
however , the unusual heat is set to come to an end soon - a high pressure system responsible for clear skies and high temperatures has moved on , meaning forecasters expect a cooling trend starting from today .			0

@entity10 sees highest ever temperature for this time of year at @entity59
@entity2 *flock* to lakes and beaches to take *advantage* of freak heatwave
