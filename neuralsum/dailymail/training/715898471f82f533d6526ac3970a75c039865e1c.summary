by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 4 june 2013 these amazing photographs show @entity3 astronauts hard at work training for missions in space - in the world 's largest pool			2
the @entity10 space agency has built a swimming pool 10 times as large as an @entity14 pool in an attempt to prepare astronauts for the experience of weightlessness			1
the @entity19 contains 6.2million gallons of water , used by astronauts in full space suits to carry out the tasks they will be expected to perform in space			1
hundreds of astronauts have used the state - of - the - art training device ahead of missions aboard the @entity33			2
among those who have trained at the lab is @entity45 , who shot to fame over the past few months with a series of popular @entity49 videos chronicling his experiences in space			0
the @entity19 is located at the @entity19 , near @entity3 's @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity27			1
simulation : neutral buoyancy , where objects neither float nor sink , is close to the lack of gravity experienced in space hard at work : an astronaut in a full space suit trains at the @entity19 , which is 40ft deep and the size of 10 @entity14 swimming pools familiar sight : astronauts work on a capsule similar to those fitted to a rocket which transport operatives to the @entity33 it consists of a large indoor pool of water in which astronauts perform simulated tasks in preparation for upcoming missions , such as spacewalks			1
neutral buoyancy is the term used to describe something that has an equal tendency to float as it does sink - providing practically the same situation as being truly weightless			0
the walls surrounding the pool are six foot thick and support nearly 26,000 tons of water which has been filtered and heated to @entity87			0
since the mid- 1960s , neutral buoyancy has been an invaluable tool for testing procedures , developing hardware and training astronauts			0
going in : an astronaut stands on a platform prior to being lowered into the @entity19 for training taking a breather : an astronaut surfaces after spending time in the lab preparing for a future mission to outer space monitoring : @entity3 staff watch the progress of a simulated space walk in the @entity19 using a bank of video screens astronauts require preparation for weightlessness because of the difficulty of operating equipment and moving around in such an unfamiliar environment			1
many people who travel outside the @entity112 's atmosphere suffer from ' space sickness ' , which leads to nausea and vertigo			0
when astronauts spend extended periods in space , they can suffer more serious conditions such as muscle atrophy due to the difficulty of exercising properly .			0

@entity19 in @entity27 is the size of 10 @entity14 swimming pools reaching depth of 40ft
@entity128 astronauts to prepare for *effects* of weightlessness while carrying out tasks at the @entity33
