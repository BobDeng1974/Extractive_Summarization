by @entity0 a matter of trust : @entity4 president and ceo of @entity8 racing @entity6 and his ex-wife @entity9 @entity6 is accused today of avoiding a potential £ 1billion - plus tax bill after the @entity4 tax authorities scrapped an inquiry in return for just £ 10million			1
but the secret deal could now be overturned – and @entity8 supremo mr @entity6 , 83 , could again face a colossal tax bill – thanks to associated claims that his ex-wife @entity9 mysteriously pays him £ 60million a year			1
her majesty 's @entity19 last night refused to discuss the allegation that it spent nine years probing the tycoon 's affairs and links with offshore family trusts before quietly reaching an agreement			1
but the case focuses a fresh spotlight on complaints that the taxman is all too ready to agree ' sweetheart deals ' with the super-rich and big businesses			1
last night shadow attorney general @entity35 called for a new investigation into mr @entity6 and his family trusts by @entity19 , saying that £ 10million was insignificant compared to potential tax bills			1
mr @entity6 refused to answer detailed questions about his tax affairs but insisted that he had always paid his fair share and denied any wrongdoing			1
his tangled financial affairs are under scrutiny in a @entity46 court where he is charged with giving banker @entity47 a £ 27million bribe to ensure @entity8 shares were sold to a company which supported mr @entity6			1
@entity47 has already been jailed for eight and a half years over the cash , half of which appeared to have come from mr @entity6 , and half from the family trusts			1
crucially , fabulously wealthy sports mogul mr @entity6 admits making a huge payment , but denies it was a bribe , instead claiming he was being blackmailed by @entity47			1
the banker , he says , was threatening to make untrue allegations to @entity19 which could have cost him a fortune			1
his potential tax bill hinges on offshore family trusts established by mr @entity6 in 1996 , when he handed over ownership of his @entity8 holdings			1
the trusts – which have links to tax havens including @entity68 , @entity69 , and elsewhere offshore – reputedly contain several billion pounds in profits from tv rights sales , from which the @entity19 has received nothing in tax payments			1
mr @entity6 last week told the @entity75 court he created the trusts legitimately to avoid ultimately paying out huge sums in inheritance tax , which he said would have been ' very unfair '			1
according to him , they are entirely for the benefit of his jet - set daughters @entity81 and @entity82 and ex-wife – and he neither has anything to do with the management of the funds involved , nor benefits from them			0
as a result , he says , he is not liable for any tax relating to the trusts			0
a long @entity19 inquiry into the trusts , however , suddenly ended when £ 10million was handed over , @entity101 's @entity100 is to report tonight			1
according to the programme , court documents reveal that one of the lawyers who runs the family trusts , @entity109 solicitor @entity108 , told @entity46 prosecutors in 2011 that the long - running investigation by @entity19 into the @entity6 family trusts was settled in 2008			1
she reportedly said : ' the @entity113 offered to conclude the matter if we paid £ 10million			0
without knowing the legal basis that had given rise to this offer , we decided to pay up , without discussing things in great detail			0
' miss @entity108 is also said to have revealed that since mr @entity6 and his wife divorced in 2009 , she had been paying him around £ 60million a year – a surprise to those who assumed it was he who had given her a massive payoff when they parted			1
she said the payments were from his ex-wife directly , rather than from the family trusts – although she added that @entity9 had herself taken about £ 700million from the trusts			1
there was no answer at mr @entity6 's palatial home overlooking @entity136 in @entity137 yesterday			1
when approached by @entity100 , mr @entity6 refused to answer detailed questions about the trusts			1
he did , however , deny any wrongdoing , saying he personally stumped up almost £ 52million in tax last year , and had always paid his fair share			0
mr @entity6 said : ' other britons with my wealth and means have chosen to live abroad to avoid paying @entity4 taxes			1
however , i am proud to be @entity4 , proud to live in @entity4 , and proud to make my contribution by paying my taxes here			0
' mr @entity6 said his divorce was a ' private matter ' , but there was nothing contrived or artificial about the transfer of assets to his wife in 1996			1
a lawyer for the family trusts , meanwhile , said : ' mr @entity6 has not exerted , and has never sought to exert , any control over the management of the trusts			1
' the lawyer also said that the transcripts from the @entity46 prosecutor contained errors – but did not say what they were			0
@entity9 's lawyer said the family trusts were managed by appointed trustees who did not include mr @entity6			1
* @entity6 : lies , bribes and @entity8 will be shown on @entity101 tonight at 8.30			1
commentary by @entity174 money has always been @entity6 's prime motivation			2
born in comparative poverty in @entity178 , he became one of @entity4 's richest tycoons by transforming @entity8 from a sport for car enthusiasts into a global brand producing profits of more than £ 1billion a year			2
during that journey , he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £ 2.5billion for @entity189 a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by the @entity193 , and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of used cars with criminals , the fruits of his wealth have been sweet			0
they include a large yacht , racehorses , fabulous houses across @entity137 and in @entity109 , a private jet and even his own airport in @entity205			0
with typical swagger , @entity6 always pays in cash , often peeling off 500 - euro notes from a wad			2
indeed , he has been known to carry $ 1million ( £ 600,000 ) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room by mistake			0
with his vast fortune , $ 1million is petty cash			0
life of luxury : @entity6 's yacht , @entity219 of course , it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently accused in a @entity46 court of paying a £ 27million bribe to a banker to secure the sale of a stake in @entity8 to a company he favoured			1
now he faces @entity100 's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £ 1billion in taxes			2
for his part , @entity6 , an inveterate gambler , is unfazed			2
last night he told me : ' everything about my taxes is clear and straight , yet everyone is looking for a mystery			0
' in the tycoon 's view , @entity100 is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement			0
others , of course , may see matters differently			0
the story behind the @entity101 team 's allegation started in 1996 , when @entity6 , then 66 , was trying to raise £ 1billion by selling part of his @entity8 empire			1
during the negotiations , lawyers told him that his then wife , @entity256 , a statuesque @entity258 model he met during the @entity260 @entity259 in @entity261 , could n't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes because she was not domiciled in @entity4			0
so , to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death , @entity6 legally transferred his wealth to a trust in @entity109 which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of herself and their two daughters			2
to guarantee that no inheritance taxes could be claimed by the @entity113 , @entity6 would have no control over the trust			2
also , for the tax avoidance to be watertight , he had to live for another seven years			0
the scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery			0
he survived but there was another hitch in 2008 : @entity9 decided to file for a divorce			0
suddenly , @entity6 faced a major dilemma			2
his lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the @entity109 trusts from @entity9 but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had created			0
so instead , he asked @entity9 to pay him what she thought ' fair '			0
@entity9 duly agreed to give her ex-husband £ 60 million a year for ten years			0
that crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by the @entity113 into @entity6 's private use of his company 's cars , plane and homes			2
in the revenue 's opinion , @entity6 should have paid more tax on the benefits			2
in due course , both sides agreed to settle for a payment of £ 10million			0
at the same time , @entity9 agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for having benefited from the trust , and she also paid the taxman £ 10million			0
but it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in @entity6 standing trial in @entity46 , charged with bribery			2
in 2002 , the then majority - owner of @entity8 , a @entity46 tv tycoon , became bankrupt			2
his shares were seized by a @entity46 bank which had loaned him the money for the original purchase			0
in a complicated case , the @entity46 authorities allege that @entity6 bribed the @entity46 banker controlling the shares to ensure that @entity8 was sold to a private equity group of @entity6 's choice			1
the prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the company , @entity6 would remain in charge of @entity8 and its commercial rights , broadcast payments and sponsorship deals			1
@entity6 , who once advised me : ' never threaten – just do it ! ' , admits making the payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue of whether he controlled his family trust in @entity109			2
having transformed himself from a second - hand car dealer into the owner of one of the world 's most popular sports , he admits he breaks rules – but not laws			0
controversially , he has said : ' first get on , then get rich , then get honest , ' and , ' in @entity8 , everyone cheats			2
the trick is not to get caught			0
' competitive to his core , with steel - tipped elbows , @entity6 – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win			0
' show me a good loser , ' he has said , ' and i 'll show you a loser			0
' * @entity174 is the author of @entity352 : the @entity353 of @entity6			0

deal could be overturned and @entity8 boss could again face a large bill
@entity19 refuses to discuss allegations it quietly reached an agreement
case focuses spotlight on ' sweetheart deals ' with the super-rich
