commercial rivals claim that the @entity3 ’s most popular radio stations are neglecting their public service obligations in pursuit of high ratings and are harming smaller competitors by drawing away their listeners			1
an alliance of commercial radio stations has now voiced its concern in a submission to the @entity23			0
@entity24 , the industry body that represents commercial radio stations in the @entity27 , has now told the committee that the @entity3 ’s most popular radio stations have become too dominated by popular artists that listeners can hear on commercial radio			1
they said : ‘ the @entity3 ’s radio services , particularly @entity3 and @entity7 , should be more distinctive and take the opportunity to provide greater public value , rather than simply seek large audiences			2
‘ it is hard to avoid the conclusion that much of the @entity3 ’s growth in listening share in recent years has come at the direct expense of the commercial sector			2
’ the hearing comes ahead of a parliamentary inquiry about the running of the @entity3 in the run - up to renewal of its royal charter in 2017			0

@entity3 , for example , should focus on younger listeners but the average age of its audience is now 32 , @entity24 said			0
a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ‘ research shows that not only is there strong public support for the @entity3 showing a wide range of content and funded by the licence fee , but also that in countries where public service broadcasting is strong , commercial broadcasting is also strong			1
