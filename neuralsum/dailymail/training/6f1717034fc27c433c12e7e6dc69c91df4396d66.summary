by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 20:00 est , 24 october 2013 they say an @entity3 ’s home is his castle – but billionaire businessman @entity5 seems more intent on building an urban palace			1
for the mobile phone tycoon plans to turn two mansions in one of the most upmarket parts of @entity11 into a single dwelling the size of @entity14			1
an ‘ iceberg ’ extension will be created by excavating beneath the existing properties to make space for a vast games room , swimming pool , sauna , kitchen , salon , media room , plant room and car park			1
extension : @entity5 wants to link the town house ( left ) to his mansion ( right ) via a 14,000 square foot subterranean extension @entity32 mansion : @entity5 's plans for a £ 250million mega home which will be created by linking his two existing central properties with a 14,000 square foot underground extension redevelopment : a cross section of the smaller @entity32 property with the new basement kitchen underneath marked up in the plans submitted to the council it will be about 180ft long , stretching under each house and joining them beneath their gardens , which back on to each other in @entity32			1
the result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft , while other mansions in @entity32 are from 10,000 sq ft. the ‘ iceberg ’ extension alone will cover 14,000 sq ft. once complete , the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms – there are five in each house already and the plans include two more in the underground extension			1
with property prices for super-prime homes in @entity32 at around £ 5,000 per sq ft , the finished home could be worth £ 250million			1
mr @entity5 , 61 , who is worth £ 1.5billion , bought the two properties last year for a total of £ 81 million and has submitted his plans to @entity68			1
the bigger of the two houses , built in 1877 , is @entity70 listed			0
at 22,000 sq ft , it has marble floors and a ballroom thought to be the largest of its type outside the @entity76			2
@entity77 home : @entity5 wants to link these two properties he owns in @entity32 with an underground extension which is not visible in this image submitted to @entity68 extension : the new lower ground floor will feature a games room , kitchen , pool , sauna , changing room , media room , plant room and a car lift in the 1960s it was a members club and , according to its history , was frequented by ‘ dubious gangland characters ’ , footballers and celebrities			1
it was bought by @entity96 , brother of the @entity97 , in 1992 for a reported £ 18million			2
he spent millions decorating it and sold it to an investment group a decade later			2
mr @entity5 grew up in a working - class background in @entity102 and was a second - hand car dealer before forming @entity104 , which he sold in 2006 for £ 1.5billion			1
he is thought to be @entity106 ’s highest income - tax payer , personally contributing more than £ 200million over the past five years			2
@entity77 home : these photos sent to the council show a fireplace in a ground floor room in the property ( left ) and an oak - panelled entrance hall with a stone floor ( right ) @entity115 : a staircase and doorway in one of the two properties that are being knocked together ( left )			0
billionaire @entity5 who founded phones 4u is planning the remarkable extension to his two central @entity11 homes yesterday a statement on behalf of mr @entity5 said : ‘ the new works are intended to reinstate its quality and make it a fitting @entity32 house			1
‘ the application ... makes significant efforts to correct poor alterations and to reinstate elements of heritable significance			0
mr @entity5 is also seeking minor alterations to the roof and the construction of an orangery			1
’ @entity137 homes , a trend among the super-rich , involve digging down below ground to create more space than traditional extensions			0
but they are controversial because of the inconvenience they can cause to neighbours during the building work			0
mr @entity5 , who is divorced and lives with long - term partner @entity148 , may have a battle to get his plans approved			1
the annual number of iceberg extension applications in @entity68 has more than doubled from 79 in 2008/09 to 181 in 2011/12 and local government chiefs are threatening a crackdown			1
@entity155 , conservative deputy leader of @entity68 council , said recently : ‘ it is about restricting developments akin to the decks of a nuclear submarine that are too large and cause real disruption for our residents			1
’ but leading @entity32 estate agent @entity164 said : ‘ it ’s wonderful news that one of the biggest investors in @entity32 is @entity106 and the plans should be applauded			2
some complain about iceberg homes because of the amount of work involved but there is also a lot of work when building new homes			0
‘ it is catching up with modern - day living and they are going to be restoring one of @entity32 ’s finest homes			2
’ billionaire : @entity5 , 61 , who sold his @entity104 business for £ 1.5billion in 2006 , with his partner @entity185 another home : a @entity188 mansion that @entity106 's biggest income tax payer @entity5 owns alongside two @entity32 properties he is hoping to turn into one wealth : @entity5 , 61 , with his @entity193			1
the philanthropist started out as a used car salesman before founding @entity104 phone tycoon : billionaire @entity5 pictured in the 1990s with a selection of mobile phones which his company @entity104 had on sale at the time with prime real estate in @entity11 's most upmarket areas in short supply and going for an enormous premium , the capital 's billionnarires are increasingly going underground in their bid for a bigger house			1
the likes of @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 have all extended underground			0
in the past the majority of homeowners have extended upwards over fears of causing permanent structural damage			0
but the trend for so - called ' iceberg homes ' is growing			0
ten years ago , the number of planning applications for basement extensions in @entity223 and @entity224 was just 64			0
last year , the number had soared to 307			0
however , extending underground comes at a premium			0
in august , multi-millionaire hedge fund manager @entity228 was order to pay £ 800,000 to create a huge two - storey underground basement below his two adjoining @entity223 townhouses			2
he received the unprecedented levy from @entity223 and @entity233 when he was granted planning permission for the extension , which houses a swimming pool , spa and ' treatment area '			2
one - off levies are not the only downside to extending underground			0
@entity242 director @entity241 had to apologise to his furious neighbours in @entity223 last summer after his £ 1million basement excavation — built to fit a playroom , guest room , gym , wine cellar and cinema into his £ 7 million house — left cracks in neighbours ' properties			0
however , despite the issues , the wealthy continue to dig underground			0
estate agents @entity256 says : ' the main reason basement conversions are really growing in popularity is because , unlike loft conversions , basements are normally closer to other communal areas and can be more versatile living spaces that suit modern lifestyles , not just extra bedrooms , bathrooms or studies			0

@entity5 , 61 , is planning a 14,000sq ft underground extension to link his two @entity32 mansions
billionaire started out as a used car dealer before he created @entity104 which he sold for £ 1.5bn in 2006
his new ' iceberg ' mansion will be only *slightly* smaller than @entity14 once finished
mr @entity5 has submitted a planning application for the mega home to @entity68
