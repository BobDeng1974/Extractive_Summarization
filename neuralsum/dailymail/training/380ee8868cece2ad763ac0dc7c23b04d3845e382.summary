by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 17:55 est , 21 august 2012 in time for @entity1 : @entity3 mobile services , which are up to seven times faster than @entity6 mobile networks , have come much earlier than expected @entity3 mobile services which allow smartphones to run high - definition movies and download a song in just four seconds will be unveiled in time for @entity1			1
the decision to give the go - ahead to the services , which are up to seven times faster than existing 3g mobile networks , has come much earlier than expected			1
initially , it was thought that @entity3 would not begin to be rolled out in the @entity17 until next summer at the earliest			0
but telecoms watchdog @entity18 has announced that @entity17 ’s biggest mobile phone company @entity19 will be allowed to launch its 4g service from as early as next month			1
the services will allow smartphone users to do everything their home broadband and wi - fi systems can do but ‘ on the go ’ through mobile networks			2
however , consumers will need to spend hundreds of pounds on new handsets which are compatible with the technology			0
a new @entity31 5 , thought to be compatible with @entity3 , and other high - speed handsets are due to be launched by @entity1			1
a number of other countries , including the @entity38 , parts of @entity34 and the @entity35 , already have @entity3			0
@entity17 ’s adoption of the technology has been delayed because of a shortage of radio airwave spectrum to carry the services			0
the necessary space was created by the shutting down of analogue tv signals and @entity18 is currently inviting mobile phone companies to bid for a share of the airwaves to run 4g services in an auction that is expected to raise more than £ 4.5billion for the government			2
however , @entity19 has managed to circumvent this process because it found sufficient spare spectrum on its existing 3g mast network to launch @entity3 now			1
mobile phone firms are angry at @entity18 's decision to invite mobile phone companies to bid for a share of the airwaves , claiming it gives everything everywhere a major advantage the decision has given @entity19 , which owns the @entity65 and @entity19 brands and has some 27million customers , an advantage over rivals			1
and @entity69 claimed consumers would lose out because @entity19 would effectively have a monopoly			0
it said : ‘ we are shocked that @entity18 has reached this decision			0
‘ the regulator has shown a careless disregard for the best interests of consumers , businesses and the wider economy through its refusal to properly regard the competitive distortion			2
’ but @entity19 hailed @entity18 ’s decision as ‘ great news for the @entity17 ’			2
it said : ‘ @entity3 will drive investment , employment and innovation and we look forward to making it available later this year			0

@entity3 mobile services will be unveiled in time for @entity1
the services are up to seven times faster than existing 3g mobile networks and allow smartphones to run high - definition movies and download songs in just four seconds
telecoms watchdog @entity18 has announced that company @entity19 will be allowed to launch its 4g service next month
