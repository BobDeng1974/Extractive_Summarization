@entity3 explained she was delighted to receive the commission and could n't wait to get started			0
she said : ' i was really happy about it and it had me written all over it			0
i was in @entity44 at the time when they rang me and i got up and got dressed and went straight home and set about planning it with my family			0
the next morning i got up and we set about it straight away			0
" the picture was taken at her uncle 's @entity54 ' farm , @entity53 in @entity16 , but only after first attempting to get the shot at her parents ' farm , @entity61			0
rounding up the flock from the field and tempting them with food so that they follow the buggy to the ' studio ' like herding cats : @entity3 started off arranging the sheep in the field but found she could n't get the perspective ( or get them to stay still ! )			2
' in some cases it was good but just did n't have the ' wow factor ' i wanted ' , she said facing the camera full on , the sheep wait as @entity3 prepares the troughs in a heart shape on the farm in the hope the new setting and the offer of food will help her get the picture she is looking for she said : ' we started off putting feed down for the sheep in the shape of a heart			1
we started doing that on the fields at home but it proved to be a lot harder than i first thought ! ' i could n't get the perspective , in some cases it was good but just did n't have the ' wow factor ' i wanted			0
' we tried a few different locations there and the final shot was six hours later with the farm in the background			2
we 'd started at 7.30am and finished at 2.30pm			0
' we tried different fields and different ways of putting feed down but in the end we did it by putting troughs down			1
' she prepared a heart frame made out of troughs which she then filled with feed once the feed was poured in ( left ) the unsuspecting models filed into position gradually the heart formation came together ( left ) until finally , after six hours of trying , @entity3 got the all important shot she was looking for all day how the final picture looked as part of her campaign to raise money for the @entity11 @entity3 had help from family and friends with her parents @entity130 and @entity132 , her friend @entity134 , aunt and uncle @entity136 and @entity54 , and cousin @entity133 , all getting involved			1
she said she is delighted with the end product			0
she said : ' i am pleased with the reaction and overwhelmed with how much attention it has had on @entity144			0
people all over the world have been sharing it and liking the photo			2
" @entity3 said the picture has been made even more poignant after the sad death of her grandfather , @entity151 , last week			2
she said : ' it 's especially special now because @entity53 is my grandfather 's home and sadly last week he passed away from a heart attack			1
that makes the picture special because it 's for the @entity11 and it 's his home			1
