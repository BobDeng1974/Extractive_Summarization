@entity0 was 17 years old when he was sat in a hotel on @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity5 manager @entity4 told him he would be making his debut later that day at @entity7			1
the fearless teen duly started , helped @entity5 to a 2 - 2 draw and walked away with man - of - the - match honours having been in opposition to the likes of @entity13			0
fast forward nine years and @entity0 is still to win on @entity14			1
he was part of the @entity17 side smashed 5 - 1 and was sent off on his last appearance there , dismissed for dissent after the full - time whistle of a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity0 ( left ) playing on his career debut for @entity5 against @entity3 in january 2006 @entity0 now plays for @entity17 and was voted @entity25 footballer of the year for 2014 consolation can be taken from successive 3 - 0 victories for @entity17 , but @entity0 was in the stands rather than on the pitch			1
today , the @entity30 has the chance to make his own mark			0
' with making my debut there it 's a special ground for me and i 've got good memories of there , barring the 5 - 1 , ' he said			1
' i think it 's a good ground , good atmosphere , it 's a place i look forward to going to			2
' before the 5 - 1 we were flying at the time and we went into it doing really well			0
we were confident that year but a lot of the team had n't played in the derby and a lot underperformed on the day			0
' we 've got a lot of lads still here from that day and we 've been happier in recent years			0
we 've had the upper hand since then			0
' remedy after that drubbing in 2010 was sought at the bottom of a pint glass , on the instruction of manager @entity57			0
@entity0 recalled : ' @entity58 got us in the next day and to be fair to the manager he said , ' @entity61 the decks			1
take tomorrow off and get out and do whatever you want as a team			0
get out and try and switch off '			0
' we got together as a group , we went out and had a chat and a few beers and the next week we responded well and got on a good run			0
the manager handled it well			0
' @entity71 will be playing for @entity3 on sunday , but used to play alongside @entity0 at @entity17 @entity72 will be hoping they 're enjoying a celebratory tipple this time around			1
the @entity17 would make their own piece of derby history with a fourth straight win over the @entity77			1
@entity3 's @entity71 was part of the @entity17 team which won 3 - 0 last season and scored the final goal at the @entity82			1
he and @entity0 were partners in midfield as @entity85 's side pulled off last year 's @entity86 before his defection to @entity7 '			1
@entity0 admits his former team - mate has been a miss. ' @entity71 's a good friend and good player			1
we 've missed him , ' he said			0
' that 's been a bit of a loss for us			2
he made a decision to move on and good luck to him			2
' i think if he 'd gone to any other club he would have got a good reception because he did well for @entity17			2
@entity85 's side could win their fourth derby in a row against @entity3 on sunday ' obviously , where he 's chosen to go to , it 's going to be difficult for the fans to take			1
' @entity71 , though , has not dominated conversation in the red - and - white dressing - room			2
' we 're maybe talking more about the chance to win our fourth derby on the trot , which would be massive , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's a good feeling going there			2
there 's a bit of a rough reception and that 's nice			0
it 's different , it 's a big game and , as a group of players , you have to embrace it and just enjoy it			0
' @entity0 would certainly enjoy his first taste of victory at the ground where his career began .			2

@entity0 made his *professional* debut aged 17 against @entity3
a win over @entity133 's side could move @entity17 away from the drop
@entity0 will play against @entity71 , his former partner in midfield
