a grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited @entity2 island could show the remains of @entity5 ’s doomed plane which disappeared in 1937			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) say the latest evidence could be a step closer to finding out the mystery behind her disappearance			1
@entity5 , then 39 , was on the final stage of an an ambitious around - the - world flight along the equator in a twin - engine @entity15 when she and navigator @entity17 disappeared			1
the image was captured off an uninhabited tropical island in the southwestern @entity20 of @entity21 and showed an ' anomaly ' at a depth of 600 feet in the waters			1
discovery : a grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited @entity2 island could show the remains of @entity5 's doomed plane which disappeared in 1937 aim : the purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the @entity5 aircraft , after landing on the reef at @entity32 ( now @entity33 ) , was subsequently washed over the reef edge , broke up in the surf , and sank location : the anomaly is in the catchment area at the base of the second cliff ' what initially got our attention is that there is no other sonar return like it in the entire body of data collected , ' @entity42 , executive director of @entity6 , told @entity51			1
' it is truly an anomaly , and when you 're looking for man - made objects against a natural background , anomalies are good , ' he added			2
@entity6 have spent years investigating @entity5 's last , fateful flight and now according to their researchers , a sonar image shows a strong return from a narrow object roughly 22 feet long oriented southwest / northeast on the slope near the base of an underwater cliff			1
this ties in with a theory that @entity5 was able to put her aircraft down safely on the reef , but it was washed off the edge before aircraft searching for her were able to spot it			1
analysis : a graphic shows the area looked at by @entity6 team area : a map showing an aerial view of the distance between the debris field and the @entity84 - seen in a 1937 photo taken by @entity87 officer @entity86 high tech : tools utilised by @entity6 included a multi-beam sonar hull - mounted onto an expedition vessel @entity33 , uninhabited in @entity5 's time , and a mere 3.7 miles long by 1.2 miles wide , is about 300 miles southeast of @entity93			1
the holder of several aeronautical records , including the first woman to cross the @entity97 by air , @entity5 had set off from @entity99 to refuel at @entity93 for a final long - distance hop to @entity101			2
in what turned out to be her final radio message , she declared she was unable to find @entity104 and that fuel was running low			0
several search - and - rescue missions ordered the next day by then - president @entity107 turned up no trace of @entity5 or @entity109 , who were eventually presumed dead at sea			2
enduring riddle : @entity115 aviator @entity5 , posing by her plane in @entity114 , @entity101 , in 1930 , disappeared while flying over the @entity2 in 1937 fate : the @entity15 taking off from @entity117 at @entity118 , @entity101 , on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight @entity122 : researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris @entity6 are operating under the hypothesis that the duo survived the crash , reached @entity32 - which was then a @entity131 possession and now known as @entity132 - and managed to survive there for an unknown period of time			1
@entity6 believe that some key components of @entity138 aircraft - such as the heavy @entity137 engines may still be left			2
last year they returned to the island again equipped with a multi-beam sonar array mounted on a ship to construct a map of the underwater topography off the western end of the atoll			0
they also used a @entity147 to collect data along the west end of @entity132 , as well as a @entity150 capable of reaching depths of 3,000 feet , which produced hours upon hours of high - definition video			2
missing : @entity5 and @entity17 , left , before they set off on their doomed flight			1
right : earhart as a young pilot celebrated : @entity5 posing in @entity157 after completing a successful flight across the @entity97 but their recent expedition faced a number of technical problems coupled by the atoll ’s difficult environment			1
when the search failed to turn up dramatic and conclusive evidence proving that @entity5 perished on the island , some media outlets were quick to declare the $ 2.2million mission a failure			2
but on reflection the team realised they had found an ' anomaly ' in the vast data they had collected			0
discussing the discovery on their website this week , they wrote : ' the better a piece of evidence looks , the harder you have to try to disqualify it			0
so far , the harder we ’ve looked at this anomaly , the better it looks			0
maybe the anomaly is a coral feature that just happens to give a sonar return unlike any other coral feature on the entire reef slope			0
discovery : this bottle of @entity195 's lineament was found on a desert island in the area @entity5 is believed to have crashed on an ill - fated voyage around the world in 1937 clue : this hunk of glass is from a bottle of @entity206 's @entity205 balm made in 1933 @entity5 's freckles : reassembled jar fragments ( left ) found alongside other artifacts on an island have been found to resemble a freckle ointment ( right ) possibly used by @entity5 cosmetic : one of the substances found on the island was identified as rouge from the early 20th century ' maybe it ’s a sunken fishing boat that is n’t mentioned in any of the historical literature			1
maybe it ’s the boat nobody knows about that that brought the castaway nobody missed who died at the @entity224			0
maybe it ’s pure coincidence that it ‘ s the right size and shape to be the @entity15 wreckage			0
' sustaining the search are clues worthy of detective story , including items from the 1930s previously discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream , a penknife blade , the heel of a woman 's shoe and a bit of @entity244 - all believed to belong to @entity5 and her plane			1
skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery , and settlers who reached @entity132 after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage			0
conspiracy theories about @entity5 's final moments have flourished for years			1
one contended that @entity5 was held by @entity257 imperial forces as a spy			2
another claimed she completed her flight , but changed her identity and settled in @entity262			0
@entity5 's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated @entity115 for decades			1
she has been portrayed on the big screen by @entity267 actresses like @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270			0
intrigue : in her day , @entity5 was extremely popular , but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later the most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea			1
there have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery , but none have been proven			0
another popular theory is that they landed on the island of @entity286 in the @entity287 , 350 miles southeast of @entity93 and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease			0
improvised tools and bits of plexiglas that are consistent with that of an @entity15 window were found on the island			0
a few theorists reckon that she @entity5 was spying on @entity300 and had been captured and executed			2
this theory has been discounted by the @entity115 authorities and press			0
a rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on @entity307 , an @entity309 - language @entity257 propaganda station designed to attack the @entity311 ' morale			0
an @entity313 aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed @entity5 and @entity109 may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip			1
the most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity			0
a woman from @entity262 successfully sued for $ 1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory .			0
