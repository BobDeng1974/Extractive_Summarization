@entity7 says they 're running low on the @entity9 - style cheese product and the drought could continue for the next few weeks			1
that means millions of @entity9 planning their @entity13 soirees could be facing a seriously cheesy conundrum			0
smooth move : @entity7 has announced there 's a shortage of its popular , smooth - melting cheese product @entity6 just as demand ticks up for @entity22 playoffs and the @entity13 ' it is possible consumers may not be able to find some @entity6 products on store shelves over the next couple of weeks , ' @entity7 spokeswoman @entity23 said tuesday			1
though not currently widespread , football playoffs and the impending @entity13 on february 2 mean the shortage will affect more consumers than it would during other times of year			1
' this is really a short - term issue that 's more noticeable right now , given the increased seasonal demand , ' @entity23 said			1
new of the impending processed cheesepocalypse generated a minor tempest on @entity38 after @entity39 reported a possible shortage , quoting an unnamed employee of an unnamed @entity43 - area grocery as saying that no further shipments were expected until february due to ' a plant issue			2
' @entity7 , however , did not name the cause of the shortage and said only it is due to the ' nature of manufacturing ' and the ever more vague ' combination of factors			1
' the conspicuous timing of the shortage , insists @entity7 , is as much a thorn in the food behemoth 's side as it is for dip lovers			1
' good cheese ' : today host @entity60 showed solidarity with @entity6 lovers on wednesday when he took a huge bite from a loaf , his first taste of @entity6 ever dippy : demand for the popular ingredient in party cheese dips could top supply for weeks no dip , bro ? sales of the process cheese food product best $ 500 million annually and the drought comes at peek demand and it certainly is n't a ploy to encourage a nationwide dash to the super market for @entity6			1
' this is not a marketing / advertising campaign , ' @entity23 said			2
' it 's not a seasonal product , ' culinary historian @entity83 told @entity86			2
' the whole point of @entity6 is you keep it on the shelf indefinitely			0
it 's the cheese for people who do n't know how to cook			0
' for the more adept chef , there 's always good old cheddar			0
not that anyone has complained about a dearth of the two - pound loaves yet			0
' we have not heard many complaints from consumers so far , ' @entity23 said			0
@entity7 introduced the food it dubbed a ' pasteurized prepared cheese product ' on june 2 , 1928			1
the orange loaves were wrapped in foil and originally sold in wooden boxes			0
the company marketed the product as a smooth - melting , housewife - friendly alternative to traditional cheese that could be mixed with milk , melted , and poured ' over toasted sandwiches of peanut butter and sweet pickle relish			2
' @entity116 , a @entity117 immigrant who lived in @entity118 , @entity119 , is credited with creating the first version of @entity6 , which was a combination of whey leftover from the cheese - making process and cheese			0
@entity6 quickly became a hit in the @entity9 and almost as quickly became so popular in @entity125 that the plant that produced it for the country was unable to meet demand just after its release there in 1937			0
