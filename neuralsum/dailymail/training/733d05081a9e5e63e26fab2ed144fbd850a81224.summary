another top @entity1 executive has been found guilty of bullying staff , @entity3 can reveal			1
@entity4 , a senior editor and partner of radio 5 live presenter @entity6 , also faces claims of sexual harassment against a female employee			1
last night , the @entity1 also confirmed that his expenses claims were being scrutinised			1
under scrutiny : @entity4 , a senior editor at the @entity1 and partner of radio host @entity6 the latest investigation follows outrage after @entity1 bosses were accused last week of ‘ fudging ’ the case of @entity20 editor @entity19			1
he moved to another job after he was found to have bullied several staff			1
there are wider concerns of a bullying culture at the organisation			2
some staff feel the decision not to sack @entity29 contradicts assurances by @entity31 , the @entity1 director - general , who said there would be a ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach to bullying last year			1
last night , a @entity1 insider said : ‘ the upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now			2
that is the most damaging thing			0
’ after a lengthy process involving mr @entity4 , editor of the @entity1 ’s @entity41 , a disciplinary upheld a bullying claim but is still looking at the allegation of sexual harassment , it can be revealed			1
separately , it is understood mr @entity4 ’s expenses are still being investigated by the @entity1 ’s @entity48			1
@entity49 5 host @entity6 has two children with @entity4 mr @entity4 , who remains in his job while the various disciplinary processes conclude , was married to @entity1 presenter @entity53 for two years			1
he left her in 2002 for @entity49 5 presenter ms @entity6 , with whom he has two children			1
@entity41 , which broadcasts on radio on @entity57 and tv on @entity59 , is one of the @entity62 ’s flagship shows abroad and is watched and listened to by millions of people worldwide			0
one well - placed source said : ‘ mr @entity4 is someone who is known to have had a reputation for as long as he has been at the @entity1			1
he was at 5 @entity66 and other parts of the @entity1 and his reputation goes before him			2
‘ there have been previous complaints [ of bullying ] against him			2
’ it is not known if these claims have ever been investigated			2
@entity19 was moved from his job as head of @entity20 , @entity76 ’s news bulletin , after being investigated for more than 30 complaints			1
mr @entity19 denied the allegations , some of which were not upheld , but was given a final written warning and posted to another , as yet undisclosed , post			2
but some who complained have accused the @entity1 of failing to protect whistle - blowers , adding management appeared to side with mr @entity19 , who has taken a month ’s leave			1
@entity89 , the @entity1 ’s head of programmes , briefed newsbeat staff on the @entity29 situation last week and said mr @entity19 had ‘ many more expressions and testimonials of support than criticism ’			1
one complainant , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ it is outrageous for someone from management to say that			0
obviously those that gave testimonials were not the ones who were bullied			2
’ another @entity1 insider said the result of the @entity29 complaint would leave staff deflated			2
the insider said : ‘ people are very angry and the upshot is that staff will not bring cases forward now , that is the most damaging thing			0
’ a source close to mr @entity19 said : ' @entity19 rejects these claims and maintains that his behaviour was entirely in keeping with a pressured news environment			1
' a former member of the newsbeat staff defended mr @entity19 , saying : ' the idea that there was a culture of paranoia and fear about @entity20 is nonsense			1
there 's a greater proportion of past and current staff who would describe him as an uncompromising but brilliant and inspiring boss			2
' tough , yes , but always fair and wanting to get the very best out of everyone			0
my experience in @entity19 's newsroom set me and many others up to go and have successful careers elsewhere and still work by his high standards			1
" another former colleague added : ' he was always very encouraging to young talent and very supportive			0
i do n't recognise these descriptions of his behaviour			0
' conservative mp @entity144 has written to @entity31 about the @entity29 issue			0
he said : ‘ this decision looks like a fudge and i ’m sure that victims of bullying across the @entity1 will feel a sense of betrayal			0
@entity4 was married to @entity1 presenter @entity53 for two years , but left her in 2002 ‘ it is bound to damage their confidence that their employer will stand up for them in cases of bullying			1
’ following the @entity160 scandal , the @entity1 commissioned @entity161 to look at its bullying and sexual harassment procedures			1
the @entity165 review , also known as the @entity167 report , received submissions from more than 930 individuals and made a series of recommendations , including resolving accusations within 30 days and launching a confidential hotline where staff can report abuse			0
the investigations into the complaints against mr @entity4 have lasted at least six months to date , while mr @entity19 ’s case took almost a year to resolve			1
after the @entity167 review ’s publication , @entity31 said the report made ‘ uncomfortable reading ’			0
he said : ‘ we need to be honest about our shortcomings and single minded in addressing them			0
‘ i want zero tolerance of bullying and a culture where people feel able to raise concerns and have the confidence that they will be dealt with appropriately			0
’ but last week the @entity191 revealed there were 42 incidents of whistle - blowing at the @entity1 in 2012 , with 22 of these reported via the hotline			0
in the first nine months of 2013 , the rate of calls fell to 23 , with six coming through the hotline			0
a @entity1 spokesman said @entity62 would ‘ not comment on staff matters ’			0
but he said : ‘ bullying or harassment will not be tolerated at the @entity1			2
we are implementing all @entity203 at @entity205 recommendations and the @entity1 is leading the industry in the way it supports staff with complaints			0
with ambitious targets and a raft of new support for staff we are committed to ensuring all complaints are dealt with as quickly and fairly as possible			0
’ regarding why cases are taking too long to resolve , he added : ‘ while we are committed to dealing with cases in a timely fashion , the most important factor is that they are considered properly and fairly			0
‘ for the most complex cases this may mean they could take longer than 30 days to consider , particularly where multiple interviews are needed			0
also , some cases have involved a subsequent disciplinary and appeals processes			0
