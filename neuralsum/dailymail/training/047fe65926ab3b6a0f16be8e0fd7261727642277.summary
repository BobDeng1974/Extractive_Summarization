click here for @entity12 's match report from @entity9			1
@entity2 received the sixth red card of his career for lashing out at @entity15 with a lunge that was almost waist - height and left his @entity4 colleagues to defend for a 2 - 1 win over @entity19 with 10 men for more than half an hour			1
but @entity21 not only dismissed any suggestion he might have made a mistake making @entity2 captain but argued , quite bizarrely , that he was guilty of nothing more than a professional foul			1
@entity4 captain @entity2 lashed out at @entity19 's @entity15 and was sent off @entity4 won the game 2 - 1 on saturday but questions have been asked about @entity2 's temperament @entity2 is shown the red card by referee @entity31 in the 59th minute as @entity15 ( left ) lies on the floor a dejected @entity2 left the @entity9 pitch with his head bowed , but his team - mates hung on for the win @entity38 manager @entity0 would not be drawn on whether the striker was a good choice as captain the former @entity43 boss will have to make do without his skipper for the next three matches sun oct 5 vs @entity46 mon oct 20 vs @entity47 sun oct 26 vs @entity48 a straight red for violent conduct will result in a three - match ban for @entity2 , meaning he will miss the clash with @entity48 on october 26			1
asked why he saw it as a professional foul when @entity15 was deep in @entity19 ’s half , and if he should n’t have made @entity2 captain , the @entity38 snapped : ‘ for me , that is neither a good analysis by you and neither a good question			1
’ asked then if he intended to answer the question , he said : ‘ it is my right not to [ answer ]			2
’ @entity4 and @entity7 captain @entity2 walks off the pitch after receiving a red card for a kick at @entity15 the afternoon had started so well for @entity2 when he swept @entity4 into the lead in the fifth minute @entity70 doubled @entity4 's advantage when he fired home right - footed in the 23rd minute @entity19 rallied and striker @entity73 ( centre ) pulled a goal back with a close - range header the @entity19 thought they 'd equalised through @entity77 , but the midfielder 's goal was ruled out for offside @entity80 : ‘ it ’s a reckless tackle			1
there ’s no reason even to make the foul because of the position the defenders are in			2
’ @entity88 : ‘ he could have just tripped him but he just lashes out			0
sometimes he gets these moments in his career – like when he missed the first games with the national team ( at @entity94 )			0

i call that a professional foul			0
' maybe you do n't want to hear it but in professional football you make professional fouls			0
' opposite number @entity113 gave a more balanced view			0
‘ it looks cynical , ’ said @entity113			0
‘ whether it ’s a red card or not according to the rules , he just stopped him			0
