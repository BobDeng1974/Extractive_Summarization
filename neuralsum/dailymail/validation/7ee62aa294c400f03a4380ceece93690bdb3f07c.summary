president @entity0 said tuesday that he has a ' businesslike ' working relationship with @entity3 prime minister @entity2 , but that the two men have virtually irreconcilable differences in their approaches to establishing a @entity8 state as a road to @entity11 peace			1
' we believe that two states is the best path forward for @entity3 's security , for @entity8 aspirations , and for regional stability , ' @entity0 said during an afternoon joint press conference with @entity20 president @entity19			1
' that 's our view , and that continues to be our view			0
' @entity2 , he said , ' has a different approach			0
' ' and so this ca n't be reduced to a matter of , somehow , " let 's all hold hands and sing @entity31 " , ' the president told reporters in the @entity33 of the @entity34			1
' i took him at his word , that that 's what he meant , ' @entity0 said , later saying of prospects for a two - state solution that ' that possibility seems very dim			1
' ' we 'll continue to engage the @entity3 government as well as the @entity8 , ' he insisted , ' and ask them – where are they interested in going ? and how do they see this issue being resolved ? ' ' but what we ca n't do is pretend that there 's a possibility of something that 's not there			1
and we ca n't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen , at least in the next several years			2
@entity2 had said in 2009 that he would be willing to endorse a ' demilitarized ' @entity8 state as long as it recognized @entity3 's right to exist			1
but his pledge barely a week ago seemed to erase that option			0
after the election , @entity2 clarified his campaign promise about never allowing a @entity8 state to take root			1
' i said that the conditions for that today are not achievable for a simple reason , ' he said during a @entity103 interview			0
' @entity104 , the leader of the @entity8 , rejects consistently the acceptance of a @entity106			0
he 's made a pact with the @entity8 terrorist organization @entity108 that calls for our destruction			2
' ' and the conditions in the @entity11 has changed to the point where any territory you withdraw from is immediately taken out by @entity116 backed terrorists or by @entity117			0
' ' right now we have to get the @entity8 to go back to the negotiating table , ' he added , ' break their pact with @entity108 and accept the idea of a jewish state			0
' @entity124 : the president was in the @entity127 room with @entity20 president @entity19 to talk about a potential troop withdrawal , but talk of @entity3 occupied nearly 20 minutes of the press conference ' aspirations ' of @entity104 : while @entity8 - aligned terrorists call for the destruction of @entity3 , @entity0 aims to create conditions for the @entity136 's peaceful coexistence with @entity3 @entity0 declared on tuesday that those conditions were unworkable			1
' he pointed out that he did n't say " never " , ' the president said of @entity2 's apparent flip - flop			2
' but that there would be a series of conditions in which a @entity8 state could potentially be created			2
' ' but of course the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet any time soon			0
' @entity0 brushed off a follow - up question from a reporter about whether his administration would try to force the issue through the @entity150 @entity149 , where the @entity151 has for decades blocked measures designed to establish a @entity8 state despite @entity3 's objections			1
he said he would wait until @entity2 assembled his new coalition government before decidign whetehr to take action			0
@entity0 also took pains to clarify that any reassessment of @entity151 - @entity3 relations would n't have an impact on defense arrangements with @entity163			2
' our military and intelligence cooperation with @entity3 will continue – unabated , unaffected – and we are absolutely committed to ensure that the @entity3 people are safe , ' he said , ' particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians			0

president said he takes @entity2 at his word and believes he wo n't green - light a @entity8 state : ' that possibility seems very dim '
would n't confirm that he 'll press the issue at the @entity150
insisted that he has a ' businesslike ' relationship with the @entity3 *pm*
but ' this ca n't be reduced to a matter of , somehow , " let 's all hold hands and sing @entity189 " '
said a @entity8 state side - by - side with @entity3 remains ' best path forward for @entity3 's security , for @entity8 aspirations , and for regional stability '
