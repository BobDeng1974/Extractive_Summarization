this barber shop in @entity11 near @entity13 in southern @entity14 was badly damaged in the conflict despite losing the store front and part of his ceiling , the barber returned to work earlier this week in remarkable scenes , @entity3 children queue for a haircut while rubble from the conflict is strewn around the return to normality comes as the @entity33 prepares to discuss the future of the region , including plans to rebuild buildings and roads destroyed by artillery and air strikes			1
the supply of construction material - including concrete - to the @entity14 has been controversial as the @entity8 have accused the @entity3 authority of allowing @entity7 to use the supplies to construct cross-border tunnels and underground bunkers			2
however , the @entity48 said it will open a new @entity33 resolution on @entity14 , but only if it will help build on the fragile @entity8 - @entity3 ceasefire			1
peace talks between both sides are expected to resume in @entity53 , @entity54 in the coming days			2
@entity48 's ambassador to the @entity33 , @entity55 said any resolution must ' do no harm ' to the current cease - fire '			1
she said : ' nothing underscores the urgency of securing ... a negotiated two - state solution like the crisis in @entity14 and the heartbreak that so many people on both sides suffered throughout that crisis			0
' ms @entity55 said that the only way of securing the desired two - state solution was through negotiation			0

' if you mean to secure a permanent peace , @entity8 has to be a part of that negotiation , just as a practical matter , ' @entity55 said			0
' so to think that you can come to @entity94 and secure what needs to be worked out on the ground is not realistic , and in fact , is likely to have very counterproductive effects			0
' a draft resolution circulated by the @entity48 , @entity8 's closest ally , and obtained by @entity101 calls for the re-establishment of full @entity104 control over @entity14 , which was ruled by @entity7 militants who refuse to recognize the state of @entity8			2
@entity48 ambassador to the @entity33 @entity55 said a two - state solution was only possible with negotiation it includes a key @entity8 demand , affirming that a lasting solution must ensure that @entity14 is ' free of any armed personnel , assets and weapons other than those under the full and legitimate control of the @entity104			1
' the @entity118 is also considering ' elements ' for a resolution proposed by @entity122 nations , and a @entity124 draft resolution backed by the @entity3 and their supporters which was written before the latest cease - fire			1
the @entity122 proposal goes further than the @entity48 , calling for the establishment of an international @entity129 in @entity14 to ensure that the cease - fire agreement is implemented and to investigate reported violations			1
the @entity48 draft asks @entity133 ban ki - moon to consult with both sides ' on options for the establishment of a mechanism ' to assist in the transfer of construction materials to rebuild @entity14 and ' to monitor and verify the end - use of dual - use material			2
