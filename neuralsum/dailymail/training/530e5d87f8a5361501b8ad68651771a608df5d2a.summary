it 's the kind of @entity1 night that @entity3 fans have been craving for years			1
@entity4 will be rocking when @entity5 come to town , but can @entity8 ’ side topple the @entity1 champions ? @entity11 ’s top pundits give their verdicts ... @entity13 and @entity14 go head - to - head as @entity3 take on @entity5 at @entity4 @entity11 's @entity16 give their verdicts ahead of @entity3 's @entity18 clash with @entity3 how do you stop @entity5 ? @entity20 : @entity5 are lethal on the break and @entity8 will have looked at how they destroyed @entity22 last season			1
without @entity24 and @entity25 , they have lost some of that speed , but then there ’s @entity14			0
him running at @entity29 and @entity30 is a recipe for disaster			0
it will be interesting to see if @entity3 stay with a diamond or maybe use two deep midfielders to offer more protection			1
@entity14 and his @entity5 team - mates braved adverse weather during tuesday 's training session @entity40 : it is essential that @entity3 ’s full backs only go forward when it is absolutely necessary			1
you have to guard against the way @entity5 counter attack at blistering pace and they ca n’t be given opportunities to speed forward			2
@entity49 : we all know about @entity5 ’s speed on the counter but they are a big , powerful side and so dangerous at set - pieces			1
they scored two in the semi-final against @entity22 last season and again against @entity58 in the final			0
@entity60 being out will help that but it will be very difficult for @entity3			2
they must stay strong and @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 have to look after that midfield			0
@entity14 gives a thumbs up to his fans who waited to catch a glimpse of the frontman outside the @entity73 hotel so , how can @entity3 win ? @entity75 : you have to look at @entity13 because he is the stand - out player			1
if @entity3 can get him on the ball , he will frighten any defender			2
but the way @entity3 have been defending this season , i do n’t think they will keep a clean sheet			2
the only way they can beat @entity5 is to match them in attack and out - score them			1
@entity88 : they should be licking their lips at the prospect of playing @entity5			2
of course it ’s a tough game but they should relish the challenge			0
they have to work the ball well , moving it on quickly and accurately when they are in possession , and a lot depends on the speed of @entity13 and @entity101			0
but the players must enjoy the occasion and draw from it , not be fearful of it			0
@entity40 : by getting back to how they were last season			2
they need to be aggressive and intense in their play , start quick and get @entity5 on the back foot			2
if they do that , they will have another weapon to use - the @entity4 crowd			1
@entity3 must use the pace and power of @entity13 to frighten the @entity5 defence on wednesday should @entity8 play @entity118 ? @entity88 : absolutely			1
if you invest £ 16million in a player and are n’t prepared to play him after a few games it reflects badly on you			0
he has to be given the chance to continue the club ’s tradition of great strikers			0
but to do so tonight has to be his greatest night in a @entity3 shirt			2
@entity40 : no. i would go for @entity13 as the main striker with @entity131 and @entity101 supporting him			2
@entity13 can get in behind a defence but he will also press			0
@entity118 is n’t doing either at the minute			0
@entity11 's @entity16 are split on whether @entity118 should start for @entity3 against @entity5 @entity75 : i ’ve never really taken to him - he acts like a genius but he does n’t play like one - but i would probably still start him			1
i ca n’t see @entity13 working as a central striker and though @entity136 would work his socks of , he ’s not match - fit			0
@entity118 has to pray he turns it on , otherwise it could be the end of his relationship with the fans			0
they wo n’t tolerate much more			0
the @entity3 squad appeared in good spirits on tuesday as they prepare for the visit of mighty @entity5 what 's your prediction ? @entity40 : 1 - 1			1
@entity5 might be favourites but there is no chance @entity3 will lie down at home			1
@entity75 : i agree with @entity154			0
i ’ve played enough times at @entity4 to know how much the crowd can lift the team			0
@entity5 will win the home game but i ’ve got a feeling @entity3 can sneak a draw on wednesday night			1
@entity88 : the electric @entity4 atmosphere could power @entity3 to a special performance , so we could be in for a thriller			1
but i still feel @entity5 are too strong			0
a 2 - 1 away win for the @entity165			1
@entity167 @entity3 host real in @entity1 epic			1

@entity3 host @entity5 in the @entity18 at @entity4
@entity165 *giants* are favourites for wednesday 's @entity174 clash
@entity11 's @entity16 - @entity40 , @entity20 and @entity49 - give their verdicts ahead of the big game
