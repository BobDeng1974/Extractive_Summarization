by @entity1 medical correspondent ordeal : @entity3 lost her father in may 2011			0
his lung cancer was only discovered when pain in his hips became so severe he paid for a private scan the postcode lottery is killing 6,000 cancer patients prematurely each year , it was claimed yesterday			1
around 6,000 more could live for at least 12 months after a cancer diagnosis every year if the average survival rate for @entity14 matched the top 10 per cent of local healthcare areas			1
figures show the proportion dying within a year of a cancer diagnosis is two - thirds higher in the worst - performing areas of the country than the best			1
almost four in ten cancer patients in @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity24 , die within just 12 months , compared with one in four in @entity25 , says the charity @entity26			1
it has published estimates of variations in cancer care drawn from official data on cancer survival rates for 2011 - 2013			1
the assessment follows warnings by mps of a postcode lottery meaning that in some areas , five times as many patients are waiting more than two weeks to see a specialist			2
a recent study of 35 countries by the @entity43 found only @entity44 has worse survival rates than @entity46 for breast , bowel and cervical cancers			0
the latest analysis showed the number of people dying within a year of being diagnosed was almost 60 per cent higher in @entity22 and @entity23 than @entity25 – where only 24 per cent of cancer patients do not survive for 12 months			1
in @entity22 and @entity23 , 38 per cent of people diagnosed die within a year , a figure matched by @entity56 , @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity61			1
wealthier parts of @entity59 and the @entity66 are among the best - performing areas , including @entity68 – where 27 per cent of people die within a year – and @entity70 , @entity71 , where the figure is 28 per cent			1
well - performing : wealthier parts of @entity59 are among the best - performing areas of the country , including @entity68 ( pictured ) , where 27 per cent of people die of breast , bowel and cervical cancers within a year contrast : in @entity22 and @entity23 ( pictured ) , 38 per cent of people diagnosed with cancer die within a year experts say the alarming divide could be due to variations in how promptly patients are diagnosed and treated			1
areas with the poorest survival rates are , on average , failing to meet a key @entity90 target which aims to ensure cancer patients begin treatment within 62 days following an urgent referral from their gp			2
@entity95 points out that there are regional variations in opening times of diagnostic units and availability of experienced staff			2
its research also shows people do not always recognise the signs and symptoms of the disease , and may delay seeking help			0
if people do go to their gp early with cancer symptoms , these are sometimes not picked up by doctors , who may wait longer than necessary before referring someone to a specialist			2
the figures show that of the 80 per cent of cancer patients who saw their gp with symptoms before going to hospital , 17 per cent saw them three or four times			2
one in ten saw their gp five or more times			0
@entity121 , director of services and influencing at @entity26 , said the figures show ‘ an inexcusable postcode lottery , which is responsible for 6,000 people dying needlessly within 12 months of being diagnosed with cancer every year ’			1
auditor @entity3 , 34 , from @entity126 , described the ordeal suffered by her father , @entity128 , who died in may 2011 aged 58			0
he had been diagnosed with lung cancer just eight weeks previously			0
the former nursing home owner visited his gp several times with a persistent cough , but was told he had bronchitis and given repeated courses of antibiotics			0
his cancer was only discovered when pain in his hips became so severe he paid for a private scan			0
his daughter said : ‘ he had a persistent and very nasty cough for about 18 months before he died			0
‘ despite being a heavy smoker for over 30 years , and being slap in the middle of the average age to develop lung cancer , he was n’t offered a scan			0

proportion of cancer patients dying within a year is higher in certain areas
nearly four in ten patients in @entity22 and @entity23 die within 12 months
this is compared to a lower 24 per cent of people in @entity25
wealthier parts of @entity59 , like @entity68 , among best - performing areas
@entity26 published estimates of variations in cancer care
