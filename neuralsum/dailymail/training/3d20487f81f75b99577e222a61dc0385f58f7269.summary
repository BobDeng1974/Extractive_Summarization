by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 17:16 est , 14 october 2013 deputy prime minister @entity1 addressed young people at a business start - up centre in @entity4 @entity1 weighed into the row about rising energy bills yesterday , claiming that scrapping green taxes would make household bills higher in the long run			1
he struck a different note from @entity11 , who said last week that green levies should be phased out as quickly as possible			1
the levies account for 10 per cent of the average energy bill and are set to reach a third by 2020			2
despite the focus on how to reduce the cost of living , mr @entity1 said yesterday that subsidies for windfarms and nuclear power were needed to spur the investment needed to keep the lights on			1
addressing young people at a business start - up centre in @entity4 , he said : ‘ like everyone else i want us to strain every sinew to keep those bills down – but i do n’t think anyone should think that by scrapping all the levies suddenly with one bound we will be free			1
‘ actually what will happen is that you will have less investment , probably higher bills over time and an increase in fuel poverty			2
that can not be the right answer			0
the whole point of putting some of these levies on bills is to make sure that we do keep lights on			1
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ people ’s bills go down over time by making sure that their homes are more properly insulated and that fuel poverty is properly tackled			1
of course we need to keep everything under review – i do n’t want to see a penny more going on to bills than is strictly justified			2
’ in @entity48 last week , the prime minister said that green taxes ‘ should not be there for a moment longer than are necessary ... as soon as those industries can pay for themselves ’			1
mr @entity1 ’s remarks came after the boss of a power firm warned that bills could rise even more sharply than expected because of a £ 1billion new tax to boost green energy			1
mr @entity59 s remarks came after the boss of a power firm warned that bills could rise even more sharply than expected @entity62 , chief executive of @entity63 , which last week announced an inflation - busting 8 per cent increase in bills , criticised the ‘ carbon price floor ’ imposed by ministers in april			2
he released figures showing the cost to domestic consumers of the carbon price floor would be £ 194million this year , £ 374million next year and would soar to £ 709million in 2015			0
this means another £ 7 on the average household bill this year , £ 15 next year and £ 26 in 2015			0
it was likely ‘ to have a significant impact on consumer bills ’ in future , he said			0
the tax is designed to make suppliers use less gas , coal and oil and support the growth of low - carbon energy			0
but analysts have warned that it could drive 60,000 more households into fuel poverty and @entity91 , boss of @entity92 , has described it as ‘ a stealth poll tax ’			0
the carbon price floor is a tax on fossil fuels used to generate electricity			0
power plants and manufacturers have to pay £ 16 for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit , rising to £ 30 by 2020			0
the cost is passed on to customers			0
the @entity105 forecasts that all the various green levies will add £ 286 a year to the average power bill by 2020			1
officials claim this is less than households would pay without green energy .			0

the deputy *pm* struck a different note from @entity11 who said green levies should be phased out
@entity1 claims scrapping the green taxes would make household bills higher in the long run
mr @entity1 said subsidies are needed to ' spur investment needed to keep the lights on '
