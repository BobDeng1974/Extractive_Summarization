a couple who spent five years living in a tent as they built themselves an eco-home have been allowed to keep it , despite not applying for planning permission because it was ' against their principles '			1
@entity10 , 34 , and his partner @entity11 , 54 , left their home in a north @entity15 tower block and moved to the @entity17 countryside after buying a 20 - acre field near @entity19			1
dreaming of ' living at one with nature ' , the couple spent five years sleeping in a tent and living off the land while they constructed a one - bedroom eco-cabin - complete with compost lavatory - from wooden crates , scrap metal and lorry tyres			1
home sweet home : @entity11 , 54 , and partner @entity10 , 34 , have been told they wo n't have to tear down their @entity17 home , despite having no planning consent the government planning official who decided to allow the couple 's home to stand said he was impressed by their dedication to and passion for sustainable living eco-friendly living : the couple 's house , which took five years to build , lies in their own 20 - acre field in @entity19 , and has no electricity living at one with nature : the couple gave up their home in a north @entity15 tower block five years ago and moved to @entity17 in search of the good life the couple , who shunned power tools and did all the work by hand to cut their carbon emissions , refused to apply for planning permission because they said the process wasted paper and used too much energy			1
but their dream was left hanging in the balance when neighbours complained the tumbledown timber dwelling was unauthorised			2
mr @entity10 and ms @entity70 , both of whom were carers before they moved to @entity17 , were sent an enforcement notice from @entity74 ordering them to ' remove ' it from their field in @entity19 , @entity17			1
but , in a landmark ruling , planners have praised their ' passion ' and ' commitment ' to sustainable living , and told them the cabin can stay			0
despite previous cases of people shunning planning laws being prosecuted , the couple has now been granted permission to leave it untouched for at least three years			2
government planning inspector @entity89 said the couple 's approach ' sits very comfortably ' with new rules issued by the @entity93 , which encourage builders to use natural materials to minimise waste and carbon emissions			1
the house has an upstairs bedroom , outdoor compost lavatory , kitchen / diner and bathroom , as well as an underground food store because there is no fridge do n't stand up ! the couple , who were carers in @entity109 , north @entity15 , before they moved , have an upstairs bedroom lined with wood initially the couple were told by @entity74 that they would have to tear their home down , but they have now been granted a reprieve mr @entity89 described their efforts to live a frugal life at one with nature as ' admirable ' , and said forcing the pair to leave the handmade home could have a ' devastating impact ' on them			1
he said : ' it would be very difficult to flaw the passion the appellants have to achieve their permaculture aim , a key part of which is living with nature on the land			0
' i am convinced about the genuineness and commitment of the appellants			0
they are not individuals who simply wish to have a house in the countryside			0
' the pair run a smallholding on their land which , if it proves financially viable , may entitle them to retrospective planning permission when the three - year stay elapses			2
their utopian dream to escape the rat race began five years ago when they quit their jobs as carers and @entity109 tower block and moved to their newly - acquired 20 - acre field			2
they made foundations from old tractor tyres filled with gravel , while the walls and roof were built from discarded haulage pallets and railway sleepers			2
but their refusal to use power tools meant that it took them five years to construct the small dwelling which boasts one bedroom , a bathroom with woodfire - heated bath , and an underground storage chamber			1
it has no electricity , and food is kept underground to keep it cool			0
the couple grow their own fruit and vegetables , have a compost heap for a toilet , and draw water out of the ground with a bore hole			2
@entity187 were initially supportive of their ambition to live a self - sufficient lifestyle on the remote woodland plot , but when the couple revealed plans to turn their rustic retreat into a conservation business , hosting workshops in green engineering and ' permaculture ' , locals changed their tune and complained to the local authority			0
back to basics : the rustic bathroom in the @entity17 eco-home is supplied with water heated by a wood - fired tank no en - suite here : the couple have an outdoors compost toilet which is accessible by a pathway made out of discarded wooden pallets build on - going : mr @entity212 and ms @entity70 spent five years living in a tent while they constructed their eco-home without using power tools the couple have won a three - year stay of execution at their remote , home - made home , which they have called @entity224 mr @entity10 said : ' we wanted to build a home that would let us truly live as one with nature			1
this life is not for everyone but we love it - it enables us to live a therapeutic lifestyle and be self - sufficient			0
' we took the decision to build without planning permission because the council 's procedure is not environmentally friendly enough and it goes against our personal principles			1
' a separate application for mr @entity10 to pay the council 's costs was also dismissed			0
local residents are ' furious ' at the decision to let the couple stay in the wooden house			1
one local resident , who asked not to be named , said : ' if that was me , and i built any sort of addition to my house , the council would come down on me like a tonne of bricks			0
i had to get permission for my conservatory and it took me so long , but i did it			0
' now this couple get to come along and just build what they want , with the council unwilling to do anything			0
it 's disgusting how some people are treated one way , and others another			1
' another said : ' it is all well and good them building this so called ' green home ' , but that does n't mean they should be allowed to do it without permission			0
' there are laws in place for a reason and for them to be completely ignored is unfair on everyone else who has stuck to them over the years			0

@entity10 , 34 , and @entity11 , 54 , left @entity15 five years ago to build their dream house in the countryside
they decided not to apply for planning permission because the process ' uses too much paper and electricity '
they used railway sleepers , lorry tyres , and scrap metal to build the house in @entity19 , @entity17 , but no power tools
home has an outdoor compost toilet , no power or running water , and an underground *pantry* instead of a fridge
the couple were told by @entity74 they may have to tear down their home after neighbours ' complaints
but now a government planning inspector has ruled that the house may stay because of its *eco-credentials*
angry local residents say : ' it 's disgusting how some people are treated one way and other people treated another way '
