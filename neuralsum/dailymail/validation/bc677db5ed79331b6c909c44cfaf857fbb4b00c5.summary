' someone from overseas , who is unfamiliar with areas of @entity23 and how @entity23 is as a city , often has a number of friends living in different neighbourhoods , each feeding back differing opinions on areas such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity10 , @entity60 and so on			0
' however , it is impossible to really get a feeling for an area without living or visiting there for a period of time and this , coupled with the increase in stamp duty which has made buying a property even more expensive , often leads overseas buyers to first rent a property to get to know a certain area , location or development before committing to a substantial investment in their property of choice			0

on the third occasion , having paid a year 's rent of over £ 400,000 in advance ( £ 8,500 per week ) for an ultra-cool pad apartment in @entity58 , a stone 's throw from @entity124 , he decided within three days of moving in that he loved the house so much he 'd like to buy it , so we approached the landlord and 4 weeks later we completed the purchase for just over £ 10 million			0
