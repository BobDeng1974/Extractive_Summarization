kissing coppers – the celebrated @entity8 mural which shows two uniformed policemen locked in an embrace – was sold at auction in @entity12 last week for £ 345,000			1

but two years later it was vandalised and all but obliterated			1

the work was then placed behind a sheet of @entity42 to protect it			2
the original @entity8 stencil graffiti on the wall of the pub before it was vandalised in 2008 , however , the mural was removed by specialists and replaced with a replica			1
the landlord of the @entity33 , @entity49 , sent the original to @entity51 in 2011 , with a view to finding a buyer			0
when @entity55 was auctioned on tuesday , there was no mention of its chequered history – an omission that has left punters at the @entity33 baffled			0
they recalled the day in october 2006 when two men in a plumber ’s van pulled up outside the pub and sprayed black paint over the mural			2
@entity67 , who lives in @entity20 and is a regular at the @entity33 , said : ‘ the damage was awful			2
the pub tried to clean off the paint but the scrubbing pretty much erased the copper on the left			2
‘ one night , i was going past the pub and i saw a barman called @entity21 touching up the damaged paintwork			0
' he was repainting it			0
@entity36 did a really good job			2
i joked with him that he could be the next @entity8			2
’ mr @entity67 , who is a professional magician , said he was stunned when he heard @entity55 had been sold for such a large sum			0
‘ it ca n’t be claimed to be the original			0
@entity8 ’s work might be underneath it all , but the paint you can see was done by the fair hand of a barman			1
the wall after it was tarted up by the barman @entity36 , among others			1
the work has now been sold in @entity12 ' it seems incredible that it could be considered to be a genuine @entity8			1
‘ but i guess if you ’ve got that much money to buy an airbrushed piece of graffiti you ’ve probably got more money than sense			0
’ the paint attack was captured by @entity102 and @entity103 and @entity104 pleaded guilty to criminal damage in 2006			0
they were given a six - month conditional discharge			0
the work was eventually extracted from the wall and put on sale in a fine art auction in @entity12 , @entity112 kissing coppers was sold alongside @entity8 's other work " @entity116 " ( foreground ) , along with artwork by about 50 other artists when he was planning the @entity51 deal , landlord @entity49 explained : ‘ when @entity8 put it on the pub , it belonged to the pub and , if it is sold , all the money will go back to the pub. ’ mr @entity49 declined to discuss the matter this week and a spokesman for @entity8 said the reclusive artist would not be commenting on the controversy			1
the @entity12 auction house says in its catalogue : ‘ first painted in 2004 in @entity20 , @entity132 , on the side of the @entity134 , the @entity113 is estimated between $ 500,000 ( £ 300,000 ) and $ 700,000 ( £ 420,000 )			1
