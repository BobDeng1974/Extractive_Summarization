with matches as richly entertaining as this one , even @entity1 could warm to the @entity2			1
@entity4 ’s youngsters tasted defeat in their first experience of @entity8 competition as @entity9 claimed the points but both teams played their full part in an eight - goal thriller			1
this new 16 - team competition , set up in defiance of @entity1 interference , will offer all kinds of intriguing contests between the best of @entity21 talent and the continent ’s production lines			1
@entity9 's @entity24 is congratulated after scoring his side 's second goal against @entity4 @entity4 : @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 ( @entity33 68 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 68 ) subs not used : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 scorers : @entity32 18 ; @entity37 77 ; @entity33 90 booked : @entity37 @entity9 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 63 ) , @entity53 ( @entity54 55 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 81 ) , @entity58 , @entity59 subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 scorers : @entity58 2 , 89 ; @entity56 19 ; @entity29 own goal 32 ; @entity66 90 +1 booked : @entity50 referee : @entity68 and on a soggy evening at @entity70 , it was one - nil to the @entity8 - but only just			1
the @entity72 club , who take enormous pride in their ‘ @entity78 ’ policy of only fielding players from their own region , looked vastly superior in the first half and goals from @entity81 and @entity56 , followed by a @entity29 own goal , saw them establish a commanding 3 - 1 lead			1
but the @entity4 , with a proud academy track record of their own , had equalised at 1 - 1 through @entity85 and stayed in touch thanks to late goals from @entity37 and @entity33			1
it meant @entity9 needed two late goals of their own - from @entity58 again and then @entity90 - to claim the spoils and take an early advantage in a group that also features @entity94 and @entity95			2
a hastily - arranged opening game , played before a sparse crowd of a few hundred hardy souls who braved torrential rain , hardly felt like history in the making but the @entity2 deserve immense credit for getting this idea off the ground			1
concerned that a continental competition at @entity108 level would impact on the @entity109 , itself only in its second season , @entity1 had scuppered the initial masterplan of staging games right across @entity8			1
@entity4 's @entity32 is congratulated after equalising to make the scores 1 - 1 at @entity70 but the @entity2 persevered , adroitly outmaneuvering the @entity1 red tape and regulations by playing all the matches in @entity21 under their own jurisdiction			1
a worthy tournament is born , and let ’s hope many stars of the future flourish in it			2
they could n’t have asked for a better start			2
the two teams posed for a photograph together ahead of the kick - off - a nice souvenir for the annals - and the only thing that remained was to see who would have the honour of scoring the @entity2 ’s first goal			1
we did n’t have to wait long to find out			2
inside two minutes , @entity9 ’s very first attack had the @entity4 defence slipping and sliding , allowing @entity58 to pinch the ball ahead of grounded goalkeeper @entity27 and roll it into an empty net			2
the hosts responded very well and a nicely - worked move down the left involving @entity37 and @entity38 led to the unmarked @entity32 curling a shot over the bar			2
@entity4 are one of a number of @entity2 clubs taking part in this season 's brand new competition winger @entity150 then struck the outside of the post after a moment of hesitation in the @entity9 defence saw him connect with @entity35 ’s perfect through ball			1
@entity4 were on top and they equalised on 18 minutes			2
@entity31 combined well with @entity150 on the left and his deep cross found @entity32 unmarked			2
he found the net via a deflection and it was @entity21 1 - 1 @entity164			1
straight from the kick - off , @entity9 won a free - kick wide on the right and @entity56 had only one thought in his mind			0
his immaculate inswinger evaded everyone and nestled in the net at the back stick			0
think @entity174 for @entity175 against @entity176 a few weeks ago , albeit a little closer in			0
@entity4 were again unbowed by a setback - @entity32 was found at the back post again , this time by @entity37 , but @entity46 blocked at his near post			0
the miss proved costly as @entity9 claimed a third before half - time			0
@entity4 were again guilty of loose defending and @entity50 at the back post drilled across goal , the ball hitting @entity29 and then @entity30 as it ricocheted in			0
this new competition , created despite strong opposition from @entity1 , brings together eight @entity187 teams and eight development sides from the continent			1
@entity8 football ’s governing body blocked the initial proposals to have a tournament along similar lines with games played right across the continent , fearing it would overlap with their @entity109 competition for @entity198			1
but the @entity2 have managed to out manoeuvre @entity1 by staging all matches at @entity21 venues			1
as well as @entity4 , the @entity21 clubs involved in the tournament are @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity94 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , and @entity208			0
@entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity95 , and @entity214 join @entity9 on the list of teams participating from outside @entity21			0
group matches will be played between october 15 and january 31 with all games organised by the @entity2			1
the groups have been drawn as follows : group a : @entity203 , @entity207 , @entity213 , @entity210 group b : @entity94 , @entity4 , @entity9 , @entity95 group c : @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity209 , @entity223 group d : @entity204 , @entity208 , @entity211 , @entity214 the rain abated but @entity9 ’s pressure did n’t			0
@entity27 saved well from @entity59 and @entity29 was needed to hack away another shot close to the goalline			0
but out of nothing , with just 13 minutes left , @entity4 gained a lifeline when @entity37 pounced on @entity29 ’s knock - down from a @entity33 free - kick to apply a simple finish			0
and they could have equalised when @entity29 ’s headed was blocked on the line			0
then a flurry of late goals kept the match swinging in the balance			0
first , @entity9 re-established their two - goal cushion when @entity58 fired home from an indirect free - kick after @entity27 had picked up a backpass			0
but as the clock ticked over into stoppage time , @entity4 again had hope as @entity33 fired high into the net from the edge of the box			0
the hope did n’t last too long - @entity90 flung himself at a right - wing cross to beat @entity251 with a diving header and set the seal on the @entity72 ’ win .			0
