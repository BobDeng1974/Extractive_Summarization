@entity6 , 28 , broke into a garage in @entity8 and stole a £ 400 scooter and a box of records - but victim @entity12 managed to get hold of a photo of him from a surveillance camera			1

blatant : @entity2 captures @entity6 walking away from a garage in @entity23 carrying a £ 400 scooter and box of records he was arrested the same day and made a full confession to police officers , but yesterday , a burglary charge against him was withdrawn at @entity30			1
it is understood that the case fell down because @entity6 has mental health problems and police failed to interview him with another adult			1
let off : victim @entity12 posted the image on a @entity38 neighbourhood page and @entity6 was quickly identified - but he could not be brought to justice ms @entity40 said she was outraged that he was let off the hook			2
she said : ' he was caught bang to rights			0
the @entity2 pictures proved he was there and that he took the stuff , plus he admitted it , and when the police caught him the same night he was in the same clothes			0
' but @entity49 say he was assessed by a healthcare professional and was deemed fit to be interviewed without another adult being present			2
a police spokesman added : ' it is unfortunate that this case could not be proceeded and we will be looking to see if our procedures could be tightened up to ensure that this does not occur again			0
' the police said they did not contact the victim or any other witnesses because @entity6 had admitted to the offence			0
ms @entity40 added : ' whether he has mental health problems or not , he knows stealing off people is wrong			0
' the scooter was worth £ 400 and was recovered			1
@entity6 , of @entity23 , was also in court to face another charge of attempted burglary at a house in his area on july 15			1
he had earlier pleaded guilty , and was handed a 12 - month community order , including supervision , and ordered to go on a mental health treatment course			0
after his sentence was passed , he said : ' i know it was wrong to commit the offence			0
' a @entity79 spokesperson said : ' in light of the defence ’s argument that an appropriate adult was not present during the police interview of the defendant , the @entity79 lawyer in court informed the magistrates that the case would be withdrawn for the police to make inquiries with a view to it later being reinstated			2
' technicality : a burglary charge against the 28 - year - old was withdrawn at @entity30 because @entity6 has mental health problems and police apparently failed to interview him with another adult present			1

@entity6 , 28 , suffers from mental illness but was not interviewed with another adult present
it means he walked free from court - despite confessing to burglary
he was caught on camera stealing a box of records and a £ 400 scooter
