have you seen this man ? @entity2 have released this image of a man with his face covered and gripping a knife during a robbery - but wo n't call him a suspect to protect his human rights with his face covered by a makeshift balaclava and a knife gripped in his right hand during a robbery at a bookmakers , it is probably safe to say this man is up to no good			1
@entity19 footage also shows him threatening a cashier at @entity22 in the east @entity24 village of @entity25 before making off with cash from the till			1
but today the county 's over-cautious force refused to call him a suspect in the violent crime , in case it breaches his human rights			1
and detectives have appealed for the public to help identify him - even though his face is impossible to see - and even hope he might come forward himself			0
a force spokesman maintained today the man in the photos is not necessarily the robber , just ' someone we want to talk to ' in connection with the attack			1
this is because @entity2 believe calling him a wanted man could impact on his ' right to a fair trial ' , and they say they would treat any person potentially involved in a crime in the same way			1
@entity52 , a spokesman for @entity53 , said : ' actions like this are pointless and make the police laughable			0
' it 's all part of the retreat from common sense language			2
calling a suspect a suspect does not imply guilt			2
' in this instance they are being daft and it creates a lack of respect for the police if they ca n't be straight with us - it 's counter productive			2
' they have also failed to issue a description of the robber , leaving out key details such as his height , build and accent			0
members of the public who are being asked to help name the offender took to internet message boards to poke fun at the appeal			1
one wrote : ' this has to be a wind up			0
not sure what 's more laughable , the detective asking the man to contact him - errr do you really think that 's likely ? - or the @entity19 image showing a man with his face completely obscured from view ? ' @entity24 resident @entity96 posted : ' how stupid is that ? shall we look for a man with a black woolly thing over his head ? ' do n't call him a suspect ! the police have released these images in the hope he will be identified - despite his face being completely covered the robbery happened at 6.50pm on february 26			1
detective constable @entity109 , the investigating officer , said : ' i am now able to release cctv images of the man i wish to speak with			0
' i urge the man pictured - and anyone who recognises him - to contact me , in confidence , as soon as possible			0
' i also would like to hear from anyone who saw this man enter or leave the premises around the time of the incident			0
' when asked about the fact that the suspect 's face is hidden , a force spokesman said : ' we are looking for people to identify the man , not just his face			1
' we are not suggesting the man in the pictures is the suspect , just someone we want to talk to			2
' the spokesman confirmed that no arrests have been made in connection to the raid .			0

@entity24 @entity2 say naming man as suspect could impede ' right to a fair trial '
the man is shown on @entity19 gripping a knife in bookies that was robbed
@entity24 residents poke fun at local force 's *bizarre* appeal
