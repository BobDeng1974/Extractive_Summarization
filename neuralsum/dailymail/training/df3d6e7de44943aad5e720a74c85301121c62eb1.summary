while most expectant moms fret over decorating the nursery in the weeks leading up to their baby 's delivery , @entity0 had a more pressing matter on her mind - the egg - sized tumor growing in her heart			1
the 26 - year - old @entity10 , @entity12 resident noticed something was wrong when she developed a cough before @entity15			2
when she coughed up blood , she went to the emergency room near her home and doctors first diagnosed her with bronchitis - saying they did n't know what caused the blood			2
but when the bleeding happened again , she went to an obstetrician who found the dangerous egg - sized tumor			0
risky procedure : @entity0 was 27 weeks pregnant when she underwent open - heart surgery to remove an egg - sized tumor			1
pictured above with newborn son @entity30 signs : @entity32 , of @entity10 , @entity12 , noticed something was wrong when she started coughing up blood around @entity15 while the tumor was not malignant , because of its size it had the potential to cause organ damage , a stroke or even sudden death			1
so doctors at @entity44 had a choice : either perform open heart surgery while @entity32 was still carrying the child , or perform a c - section pre-term and wait for the mom to heal before addressing the tumor			1
in the end , doctors decided that the situation was too risky and on january 17 , at 27 weeks pregnant , @entity32 underwent open - heart surgery			1
the dangers with performing open - heart surgery on a pregnant woman is that the heart - lung bypass machine can impair blood flow to the fetus			1
the stress of the surgery can also cause the patient to go into premature labor			0
operating on a pregnant woman is so rare , doctors only found 17 other cases			2
while patients usually spend about 45 minutes on the hearty - lung machine and about 25 to 30 minutes with their heart stopped during surgery , they cut those times in half for @entity32 and her unborn baby			2
' for @entity0 , we were able to reduce that to 18 minutes on the machine with her heart arrested for only 12 minutes , ' dr @entity75 told the @entity81			0
@entity82 says @entity32 was a model patient who kept stress under control throughout the process			0
she says the weight of the surgery did n't hit her until she was just about to go into the operating room			0
' then it hit me , and i started crying			0
my mom was there , she started crying			0
i guess it was n't real to me before then , ' she said			0
doctors at @entity44 decided the tumor was too dangerous to wait until after @entity32 's c - section so they operated while she was pregnant healthy boy : @entity32 gave birth to her son on april 2			1
pictured above with partner @entity101 the surgery went off without a hitch and ms @entity0 remained in the hospital for a week after surgery while she was monitored for signs of preterm labor			1
she spent the remaining two months at home before giving birth to @entity30 on april 2			1
@entity32 and partner @entity101 , 27 , now have three children together including @entity112 ' older brother and sister @entity111 , 4 , and @entity114 , 2			2
' i thought , " i ca n't believe i made it , " ' @entity32 said			0
' he 's healthy , and i 'm still going			0
