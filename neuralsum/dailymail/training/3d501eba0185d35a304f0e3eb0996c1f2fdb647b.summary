the blue heron pauses briefly , tensing up before it shoots its head forward , capturing the unfortunate gopher between its powerful beak			1
the blue heron spots the small gopher , circled , hiding in the grass in @entity7 's back garden and closes in the bird tenses itself as it prepares to launch itself at the unsuspecting gopher who is just inches from danger the small gopher spends one minute wriggling in a desperate attempt to free itself from the predator			1
then , for one brief moment it seems that the rattled rodent was about to escape to freedom after the bird dropped the animal to the ground			0
however , within a fraction of a second , the blue heron pounced again			2
this time , the bird is far more confident , raising its head and opening its gullet			0
then , without any warning , the blue heron opened its beak , swallowing the gopher in one gulp			2
the bird conducts an inch - perfect strike , grabbing the gopher with its powerful beak and lifting it skywards the heron juggles with the gopher as it tries to break free and escape certain death then , without warning , the heron drops the stunned gopher , but any respite is brief as the bird pounces again despite making its way to the bird 's stomach , the still live gopher can be seen struggling as the heron forces down its throat			1

@entity7 started filming the blue heron who began visiting his garden
*suddenly* , the heron stands motionless , before pouncing at *lightning* speed
the bird captured a gopher hiding in the grass between its powerful beak
the gopher struggles for more than a minute as it tries to escape
briefly , the rodent is freed until the heron strikes for a second , decisive time
eventually the *doomed* gopher is swallowed in one gulp
