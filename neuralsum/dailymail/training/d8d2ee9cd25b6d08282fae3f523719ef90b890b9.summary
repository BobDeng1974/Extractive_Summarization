@entity0 , pictured at the @entity1 in may , is to speak out against squalene use sharks are already in demand for their fins and now it has been revealed that their livers are being used to make luxury face cream			1
model and animal rights campaigner @entity0 is to speak out against the use of squalene , an oil extracted from the livers of endangered sharks , at the @entity16 on thursday			1
as one of @entity20 's most successful models @entity17 has caliber when it comes to the world of fashion and beauty			1
she is known for using her fame to promote environmental causes and this latest appeal hits close to home			0
she will expose one of the beauty trade 's murkier secrets - its reliance on killing sharks to obtain a key cosmetics ingredient			2
@entity17 will be joined on stage by @entity38 , creative director of @entity39 , the department store , who will announce it is clearing its shelves of all products containing squalene derived from sharks			1
almost all beauty products use a loophole in @entity48 labelling regulations to avoid revealing the origin of the substance , reported the @entity51			2
' @entity3 are now among the most vulnerable species in the ocean , ' said @entity54			0
' the unrestricted killing of sharks is just another example of human destruction of the ocean and its creatures			2
' the substance is made by sharks in their livers to help control their buoyancy in water			1
the livers of deep sea sharks , living 700 - 13,000ft below the surface , contain large amounts of the oil , which has made them an increasingly popular target for fishing fleets			1
gulper sharks , a group of long and slender dogfish with very large mouths , are regarded as producing the best quality squalene , with their oil fetching up to £ 18,000 a ton			1
some species face extinction in the northeast @entity84			2
a recent investigation by @entity86 , a @entity88 marine conservation charity , suggested that about 3m deep sea sharks were being caught each year for the cosmetics industry , with global demand for shark oil reaching about 2,500 tons in 2010			1
poor gulper sharks are likely to suffer ' livering ' and are prime targets for the squalene trade @entity96 , the report 's author , said : ' it appears that a distinct phenomenon of ‘ livering ' exists in which the liver is removed and the carcass thrown back overboard , similar to ‘ finning ' where sharks have their fins cut off before the injured animals are thrown back , usually still alive			1
' the ugly way in which squalene is obtained is in strong contrast to its uses			2
cosmetic manufacturers prize it for its power as a natural moisturiser , valuable in a wide range of skin products			2
it also makes for easy labelling because there is no obligation for manufacturers to declare its origin and many people have never heard of it			0
some @entity48 manufacturers have responded to the concern			0
the @entity51 reported that @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity132 's @entity131 skincare range used shark - derived squalene in their products , but they have since phased out the material			1
@entity132 says squalene was replaced with plant - derived substitutes two or three years ago			0
@entity96 said such changes meant the key markets were now in the @entity142			0
' @entity143 is the world 's leading market for squalene , accounting for 40 per cent of global demand			0
' @entity148 of @entity149 said @entity20 had already seen the near extinction of the angel shark with several other of its 30 shark , skate and ray species under threat			0
' protecting the areas where they gather to feed , breed or lay eggs is a potentially good strategy			0
we want the area around the @entity163 to be declared a marine conservation zone largely because of its shark life			0
' @entity17 , 25 , joined other figures from the fashion world to call on the government to support a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides linked to declines in bee populations last month			1
she has also also acted as @entity175 brand activist , speaks out for ethical fashion and recently went on a trip to acre in north west @entity178 as part of her role as ambassador for @entity183 and @entity185 ’s partnership to help save one billion trees in the @entity188 rainforest			0
