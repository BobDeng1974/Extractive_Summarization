they 're peddling porn to get bums on seats by giving away a ' free ticket ' to their productions with every sale of an erotic magazine , but the all - women @entity10 theatre group say it 's the only way to combat a sales tax that is driving people away from the stage			1
after getting hold of around 300 erotic magazines @entity18 , or @entity19 , registered as a porn distributor earlier this year			1
with the sales tax on porn less than a fifth of that on plays , they now give a ' free ticket ' to their production of ' the @entity29 ' with every 16 @entity30 ( Â£ 12.50 ) porn magazine they sell			2
the all - women @entity18 theatre group registered as a porn distributor earlier this year			2
members of the audience are given a free ticket for shows when they buy a pornographic magazine to get around a sales tax hike the group 's director @entity42 said it was immoral that magazine sales taxes stood at four percent , while duty on theatre tickets stands at 21 percent the @entity10 government raised sales taxes in 2012 in a bid to rein in the public deficit			1
within a year audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million across @entity10 the group hopes the @entity10 government will lower the sales tax on tickets to 10 percent ' if the sales tax changes , we will suspend our campaign			1
if not , we will pursue this until the end , ' the group 's director , 34 - year - old @entity42 told the @entity62			2
' we are either part of the problem or part of the solution			0
we should n't complain , we should work to change it			0
' audiences at cultural events have slumped since prime minister @entity71 's conservative government raised sales tax on tickets to films , plays and concerts from eight percent to 21 percent in september 2012			1
in the first 12 months after it took effect audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million , a 29 percent decline , according to figures from @entity10 's @entity81 ( @entity82 )			0
' it 's a real state of emergency , ' said @entity84 , a @entity85 theatre producer who heads the association			0
but in its bid to rein in the public deficit and rocketing unemployment , the government did not raise the sales tax on magazines , which remained at four percent , allowing @entity18 to take advantage of the loophole			1
' we want people to ask what kind of a society makes this kind of decision			0
that they compare pornography and @entity103 , who is @entity10 's @entity104 , and reach their own conclusions , ' said @entity42			0
pointing out that the sales tax in neighbouring @entity108 and @entity109 is only a fraction of the @entity10 cost , the group has called the government to reduce the sales tax on theatre tickets to 10 percent , the same rate as in @entity116 , which is also under pressure to reduce its public deficit			1
but lawmakers have argued that the sales tax hike on theatre tickets is needed to balance the public accounts and has shown no sign that it is willing to lower it			1
critics have also questioned the morality of distributing pornography alongside a classic @entity10 playwright , but @entity42 hit back			0
' what is immoral is not that women distribute porn magazines , ' she said			2
' but that the government offers subsidies to these publications and not to its cultural heritage			0

@entity18 registered as a porn distribution company this year
sales tax sits at four percent on magazines and 21 on theater tickets
government claim the 2012 hike is need to balance public accounts
*customers* buy the erotic magazine and not the ticket get around the tax
