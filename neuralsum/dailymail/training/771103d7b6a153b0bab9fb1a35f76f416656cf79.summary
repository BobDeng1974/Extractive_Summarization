there are all sorts of games to play in @entity3			2
one of my favourites is anticipating people 's reactions			1
ask for a cup of coffee and chances are that ' comin ' up ! ' or ' you got it ! ' will be barked back at you			2
once the coffee has arrived and you 've said thank you , take your pick from ' @entity14 ' or simply ' sure ! ' such rapid - fire responses fit perfectly with this pulsating , absorbing city — overtly positive , unambiguous , energetic			1
it 's the energy that 's so addictive			1
even the seconds counting down at traffic lights to help pedestrians cross the road safely seem speeded up			2
the police sirens are noisier , the fast food faster , the portions bigger ( never order two @entity29 salads , and remember that a ' side ' of chips will feed a family of four ) , the beer colder , the teeth whiter , the seasons starker			2
the real deal : you 'll feel like you 're on a movie set when you visit @entity3 ' @entity3 keeps you going , ' is how a stranger puts it after we take our seats at @entity40 , a terrific - and currently fashionable - restaurant in @entity42 which might be seen as passé in three weeks ' time			1
talking to strangers is perfectly normal in the @entity45			2
it 's as if everyone has just got off the plane and wants to introduce themselves			1
' where you from ? ' is the enduring refrain			2
' a little - known planet due south of @entity55 , actually			2
you ? ' ' not sure , but i 'm living in the present now			2
' @entity58 might be a good slogan to replace the whiskery @entity3			2
the taxi driver bringing you into town from @entity64 airport might have arrived here himself only two days earlier , but you would never know it			0
or , as @entity66 , author of that masterpiece about @entity68 , @entity69 , put it more eloquently : ' one belongs to @entity3 instantly , one belongs to it as much in five minutes as in five years			0
' star rating : @entity74 's @entity73 ( right ) loves the @entity77 hotel 's restaurant @entity78 and restful : the @entity77 hotel is located near @entity80 and the @entity81 where to stay ? the area is perhaps more important than the hotel , but get both right — as we do — and you 'll be richly rewarded			1
we opt for the @entity77 on the @entity87 between @entity88 and @entity89 because we are neither cool nor in our 20s or 30s ( or even 40s if you must know ) and want to be near @entity80 ( to run or walk round the @entity93 reservoir before breakfast is the urban equivalent of picking wild mushrooms on a dewy @entity97 morning ) , the @entity81 and the stupendous @entity98			1
the @entity77 is privately owned , discreet , restful			1
beautiful people glide by in pressed linen and expensive shoes - and that 's just the staff			1
its restaurant is overseen by chef @entity106 and attracts a blue - chip crowd			0
@entity74 's @entity73 loves the place			1
she lives nearby , but still checks in from time to time			1
glorious : take an afternoon walk on the @entity111 , which was once an elevated railway line from the @entity112 seasoned @entity3 will tell you the trendy @entity114 on the @entity115 is already overcooked			0
but it seems juicy enough to us			0
on sunday afternoon , after walking the glorious @entity111 ( the last section of the route , once an elevated railway line from the @entity112 , opens next sunday ) , a queue forms outside the @entity122 and we join it			0
when at the front , a man wearing dark glasses , an earpiece and holding a clipboard gives us the once over			0
' is there a party going on ? ' i ask him			0
' you bet ! ' he says			0
' well , we 've not been invited , i 'm afraid			0
' you have now , brother			0
@entity134 up to the roof terrace and have yourself a great time			0
' one place - perhaps the only place - where @entity3 retreats in on itself is at the @entity139			1
here , two vast pools with the largest man - made waterfalls in the @entity143 are sunk into the ground within the footprints of the @entity146			0
the names of all those who died in the terror attacks of 2001 are etched into the supporting walls			0
poignant : one place where @entity3 retreats in on itself is at the @entity139 culture : @entity77 's visit to the @entity81 opera house coincided with the @entity156 's production of @entity157 the september 11 @entity81 is now open , but has attracted criticism for selling t - shirts , toy rescue dogs and such like			1
' vulgarity with the noblest intentions , ' is how a relative of a man killed that day has put it			0
what 's certain is that no visit to @entity3 feels right without making the pilgrimage to this extraordinary spot			1
our visit to the @entity81 at the @entity172 coincides with the @entity156 's production of @entity157			1
first , we eat spectacularly well just across the road from the opera house at @entity175			0
after the show we walk to @entity177 and make for the @entity178 on the 37th floor of the @entity180 , with sensational views			1
across the way is a new high - rise where , our waiter says , the penthouse has just sold for $ 200 million			0
fact or fantasy ? the two blur beautifully in @entity143 's greatest city			1
a couple of decades ago , i spent three years working here			0
a fellow journalist welcomed me by saying : ' whereas in some towns you feel like you 're watching a movie , here in @entity3 you 're in the damn movie			0
' doubles at @entity199 ( @entity200 , 001 212 744 4300 ) start at £ 270			1
@entity201 ( @entity202 , 0844 2092 770 ) flies six times daily from @entity204 to @entity3 , with return fares from £ 439			0
for more information , visit @entity207			1

the @entity209 is overtly positive , unambiguous and addictively energetic
writer stayed at the discreet @entity199 hotel near the @entity81
@entity74 's @entity73 lives nearby the hotel and is a big fan
trip would *n't* be complete without a visit to *national* september 11 @entity139
another must is the @entity180 's 37th floor for sensational views
