an expert claims the loud bangs which baffled @entity2 last night sounded like a type of experimental jet engine - which conspiracy theorists enjoy linking to a rumoured spy plane			1
dr @entity7 added his comparison to a debate which began when hundreds of @entity11 users from @entity12 to @entity13 - and even @entity15 - reported ' explosions ' which shook windows and disturbed sleeping children at around 10pm			1
one resident in @entity19 , @entity20 , recorded the sounds on her phone in a mystery that has left @entity2 blaming meteors , an ' alien invasion ' , ' the @entity27 ' ... or just fireworks			1
could it be ? an artist 's image of the so - called @entity32 project			0
enthusiasts say one possible power source is a ' pulse detonation engine ' , whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip last night ( below ) dr @entity7 , an engineering research associate from @entity40 , is among a team of scientists working on the technology behind types of ' pulse detonation engine '			1
' it makes the same kind of pulsing sound as the one on this audio , ' he told @entity50			0
‘ when we run a test engine it ’s a real industrial noise and you can hear it for miles			2
we have people coming to us asking to make less noise or keep it to the daytime			0
' the engine works by using the force from a series of explosions , caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake , to thrust itself forward			0
it can theoretically power planes at five times the speed of sound			2
the technology builds upon ' pulsejet ' principles which first emerged in the early 1900s and were used in @entity72 v - 1 flying bombs			0
test flights using the most recent forms of the technology have lasted only a few seconds , but it is still listed by conspiracy theorists as a possible way of powering the so - called @entity32 spy jet			1
the theorists have cited ' @entity32 ' – a name which appeared in a @entity83 budget report in the 1980s – as an ongoing spy plane project for several years			1
officials routinely deny it exists			0
of course , that has not dampened the spirits of the theorists , who point to a sighting of a mysterious triangular object by a @entity94 oil engineer in august 1989			2
last year @entity95 also unveiled plans for a spy plane that could fly at @entity98 , twice as fast as its famed @entity99 , and said a missile demonstrating the new technology could fly as early as 2018			1
dr @entity7 was keen to distance himself from the world of conspiracy theories , though he conceded there could always some things unknown to the public			1
‘ of course we ca n’t know for sure if someone else could have the technology already , ' he said			0
loud noises : people from @entity19 ( left ) to @entity113 ( right ) were left baffled by a string of bangs last night one possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere , which would result in a sonic boom - but this was dismissed by another expert ‘ we ca n’t say for sure what this sound was , ' he added			1
' it 's possible , but even if it was a @entity131 , i think half an hour would be a bit too long ! ' @entity134 , a government secrecy expert at the @entity135 , said : ' if an aircraft is responsible , then it ’s worth noting that it may not be local at all			1
' because the sound wave that causes the boom can be reflected by the stratosphere , the source of the event could conceivably be hundreds or thousands of miles away from the place where it is heard on the ground			2
' but dr @entity148 , a senior lecturer in aviation at @entity150 , said the noises did not sound like a normal sonic boom			1
' with smaller fighter jets just a single boom would be heard , or , as with @entity155 , a " double boom " might be heard from larger aircraft as both the nose and tail cause shock waves , ' he said			0
' it sounds like gunfire or other ammunition , similar to what i used to hear as a child growing up in @entity167 when the @entity169 & @entity170 aircraft used to do bombing runs on the east coast bombing ranges			1
' it could be geological or meteorological , but certainly not aeronautical in my opinion			0
' many @entity11 users suspected sonic booms , similar to ones which shook @entity179 last month when two @entity169 jets intercepted a @entity182 cargo plane in @entity2 airspace			1
but a @entity185 spokesman told @entity50 last night she had no records of any jets being scrambled			1
some suggested unusual weather conditions might be the source , but the @entity191 dismissed those claims and said there was nothing out of the ordinary			1
a spokesman told @entity50 : ' it definitely was n't meteorological '			0
the @entity197 said there had been a fireworks display in @entity19 , but @entity11 users insisted that could not explain sounds in @entity203 , @entity113 , @entity13 , @entity204 and @entity205			1
at around the same time , a loud boom was reported by a number of people in the @entity210 areas of @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 more than 3,000 miles away			2
people described it as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows			0
theories : there was no shortage of ideas when it came to the possible source of the noises @entity223 , who recorded the sounds in @entity19 , south @entity20 , said she was watching tv at home when the unexplained sounds started			1
she told @entity50 : ' i was just at home watching tv when i could n't hear the program due to the loud noises			1
it was very distracting as it went on for ages			0
' i went out to look for fireworks but i could n't see anything in the sky			0
that 's when i recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing			2
' the 27 - year - old said that her family , who live roughly seven miles away in @entity243 , south @entity20 , could also hear the sounds , which lasted for about 30 minutes			1
she then turned to @entity11 to see if anyone could explain what they were			2
within minutes @entity11 users had started spreading hashtags from the straightforward ( # loudbangs ) to the slightly melodramatic ( # omgwereallgoingtodie )			1
reaction : there was an explosion of activity on @entity11 , where some users came up with their own theories many of the reports were picked up by @entity11 user @entity260 , who said space debris re-entering the earth 's atmosphere could have been responsible			1
' space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas , ' he told @entity50			0
' it 's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in			2
' there was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances			2
' science writer @entity278 was among the experts who dismissed the meteor theory			0
he told @entity50 that there was one piece of debris from @entity286 satellite @entity284 scheduled for re-entry , but said that the timing was ' not a good fit ' for it to have been over the @entity2			0
he added : ' i do not think it was a meteor or a piece of space - junk , as the noises mentioned spanned a large segment of time			0
plus , unless it was cloudy over the @entity2 , there would 've been visual sightings			0
# spooked : was it an alien invasion , a meteor , the @entity303 - or simply a few stray fireworks ? @entity305 , who lives in @entity306 , @entity307 , said his dogs ' went crazy for a couple of minutes ' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks			0
the noises prompted conspiracy theories and immediate claims of a ' media blackout '			2
@entity11 user @entity316 wrote : ' this is how we 'll find our that @entity303 has begun			2
it 'll be a @entity11 hashtag long before any official announcement ! ' one @entity50 reader heard similar noises in @entity323			1
@entity324 , who lives in @entity325 , near @entity326 , said the sound at 11pm local time - the same time as it was heard in @entity2 - woke his daughter and matched the recording in @entity19			0
describing the sound as ' repetitive explosions ' , he said : ' i first thought it was firework but it was different			0
maybe thunder , but the sky was clear and i did n't see lightning , even far away			0
' i was n't thinking about it until my wife read your article			0

sounds reported last night from @entity12 to @entity205 to @entity13
@entity11 users blamed meteors , fireworks , aliens and ' the @entity27 '
a woman in south @entity20 managed to record the mysterious bangs
now an expert says the noises sound like a ' pulse detonation engine '
dr @entity7 is helping develop technology behind engines
conspiracy theorists say power source could be behind @entity365 spy plane
@entity185 said no aircraft scrambled ; @entity191 said unusual weather not cause
do you have a recording of last night 's loud bangs ? if so , we would like to hear from you . please email @entity374
