mr @entity2 , who founded gay publisher @entity43 , discusses his experience of growing up in an orthodox jewish family and being educated in a @entity48 school			0
he will say that since coming out as gay , he has learned to view @entity6 differently in light of his suffering			0
mr @entity2 will argue that religion has been ' tearing families apart ' and says that parents ' rejection of their child 's sexuality due to religious beliefs has driven many children to suicide			1
he says : ' the feeling of abandonment by @entity63 in some ways has a resonance with the words of @entity6 in both the @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity69 , where he says , ‘ my @entity63 , my @entity63 , why have you forsaken me ? ’ ' mr @entity2 adds : ' of course , i understand that for the very religious , it is difficult - an orthodox jew really does believe the @entity74 is the literal word of @entity63 and a devout @entity75 believes the @entity76 is infallible			1
criticism : @entity78 , director of @entity79 , likened the comparison to @entity6 as ' blasphemous ' and questioned the @entity10 's decision to broadcast the comments by @entity2 during @entity83 ' but do people of faith really want to reject their children for something which i believe they ca n't help ? ' just as , the @entity88 authorities rejected @entity6 - for something he considered he could n't help - being the son of @entity63 ? ' the comments have drawn criticism from religious groups who described the comparison as ' blasphemous '			1
@entity78 , director of @entity97 , said : ' whilst we have immense compassion for those who feel rejection , to liken those who feel rejection because of behavioural choices they have made to @entity6 is blasphemous			2

' she said that the @entity10 's timing of the talk is a ' serious matter ' and said that the broadcaster should be looking to ‘ educate and inform ’ a population she claims knows ‘ increasingly little about @entity6 ’			2

he says : ' i can promise you , it 's not a choice , no one would chose to be different , to be discriminated against and to risk being abandoned by their family and their faith			0
i tried to have a girlfriend			0
' referring to @entity6 being questioned on whether he was the @entity135 , mr @entity2 adds : ' how different a situation is this to the questions and ultimatums given by some parents and some faiths to young gay people ? could @entity6 have escaped his crucifixion by denying who he believed he really was ?
