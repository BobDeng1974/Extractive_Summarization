perfect if you 're on a short turn - around , a hotel has opened in @entity2 where you quite literally pay for what you use			1
the sci - fi ' 9h nine hours ' hotel at @entity6 , @entity7 , is more like a honeycomb than a honeymoon suite			1
rows of sleeping capsules line the building plus locker rooms , showers and a lounge			1
the bizarre accommodation is just perfect for passengers boarding early morning flights or arriving late by car			2
the 9h nine hours hotel has been designed to provide adequate facilities for passengers delayed at airport the rooms are arranged similar to a giant honeycomb , but customers have said they are adequate to sleep in the washrooms are adjacent to the rooms which frees up more time for sleeping for the guests the cost is 3,900 yen ( around £ 21 ) overnight and you leave by 10am			1
if you just fancy a two - hour nap the cost is 1,500 yen ( £ 8 )			0
a shower is a 1,000 yen ( £ 5.50 )			0
the rules state that you have one hour to shower and get ready for bed , seven hours to sleep , and a final hour to unwind			0
you can even pay just for a shower , for £ 5.50 , but just make sure you head to the right section guests are given a locker key where they can store their baggage , that corresponds to their room number there are colour - coded cubicles for women ( red ) and ( black ) for men			0
each unit is fitted with a @entity51 - built sleeping system that gently lulls you to sleep and wakes you up at a set time by adjusting the light			0
report from people who have stayed there are that the capsules are surprisingly comfortable with more space than the average single bed			0
the hotel opened in july , where before then the airport lacked adequate facilities to rest or stay over should flights be delayed or cancelled			2
the beds can be slept in for seven hours or two hours depending on how much time the guest has available the light will alter in the pods which helps the guest know when is the right time to get up but as the demand for short - stay facilities increases , the 9h nine hours hotel offers competitive rates for varying lengths of stay compared to other accommodation around the airport			1
on checking in , guests receive a locker key , towel and lounge wear , which are all expected to be returned on leaving the hotel .			2
