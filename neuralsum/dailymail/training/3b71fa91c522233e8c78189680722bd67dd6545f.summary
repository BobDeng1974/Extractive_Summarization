after the embarrassing experience she embarked on a drastic weight - loss journey kick - started by a three - month specialist diet programme			1
@entity4 ( second from left ) pictured on a ride , was unable to fit on @entity3 at @entity8 with diet chef @entity17 slimmed to 12 stone and now wears size 10 clothes now that @entity4 has gone from her heaviest at 20 stone to just 12 , she has returned to the theme park to triumphantly take on the white knuckle ride			1
@entity4 said : ' it was the most embarrassing moment of my life - i could n't believe that i was too big to pull the barrier down			1
' i knew i had to do something and it is great thinking that i 'm now plenty slim enough to go on any rollercoaster i want ! ' the marketing student had been trying to lose weight since arriving at @entity35 university weighing 20 stone			1
six years later @entity4 , whose university course is four years long , has taken two gap years and is currently in her placement year , healthier and happier			2
the student returned to @entity8 to finally ride on @entity3 in 2014 despite considering a gastric band aged just 18 , she decided to try and lose weight alone and managed to shift some of the excess pounds by cutting out crisps and chocolate			1
but the final straw came when she climbed on to the ten loop rollercoaster for a friend 's birthday and could not buckle the barrier			0
after the embarrassing theme park incident , size 24 @entity4 vowed to lose the excess weight for good			2
@entity4 looking glam after her weight loss she said : ' i have quite good self - control when it comes to buying food for myself , it was just my portion sizes			2
' i never really ate unhealthily - i just ate a lot			0
' my mum had a gastric band fitted and i was considering one before i went to university but i realised that i had my whole life ahead of me and i wanted to try and lose weight by myself			0
' the turning point was when i went to @entity8 for my friend 's birthday and i could n't fit under the harness			2
' @entity4 signed up for @entity70 in june 2014			2
the weight loss programme provided her with breakfast , lunch and dinner for three months			0
@entity4 ditched giant meals and late - night @entity76 for vegetable soups and nutritious pasta dishes as well as taking up running			2
she dropped three stone in just three months taking her to 13st			0
after the programme @entity4 realised she enjoyed the @entity82 food and the way the meals helped her to manage her portions , so she has continued to incorporate them into her diet and has lost an extra stone since then			1
@entity4 would eat three portions at a time and arrived at university weighing 20 stone			1
she managed to shift some of it on her own by buying smaller bowls and plates to trick her brain into eating less @entity4 , right , pictured at around 16 stone , before she had lost all the weight that she wanted to lose the final straw came when she climbed on to the ten loop ride and could not buckle the barrier her commitment to healthier eating meant she shrunk from 16 to 12 stone and now wears a slim size 10			1
@entity4 's weight loss was gradual initially			0
it was only when she started @entity70 that she properly started shopping again , and can now buy slinky outfits for glam nights out			0
to celebrate her incredible transformation she headed back to @entity8 to ride the ten loop coaster			2
@entity4 added : ' i love rollercoasters and i was gutted i could n't get on			0
but mainly it was the shame that i had to walk off in front of everyone as the ride went round			0
' i love going fast and the thrill of a rollercoaster - i was the only person that would go on it with my friend - and i just had to get off and watch as the ride went round without me			0
@entity4 has transformed her life - and her look - after shifting the final four stone breakfast : triple - size bowl of cereal lunch : two large sandwiches and crisps dinner : extra-large pizza with energy drinks and ice cream snacks : late night burger and chips and a multi-pack of crisps breakfast : regular - sized bowl of low - sugar cereal lunch : diet chef pasta bowl - only 236 calories dinner : @entity150 steak with grilled veg snacks : none ' while i was at uni i tried to lose weight gradually by making small changes			1
' i even bought smaller bowls and plates to trick my brain into eating less because sometimes i was eating three times a normal portion			0
' @entity163 helped me so much and it took this huge chunk of weight off			0
' i used it to teach myself what normal people eat and how much they eat			0
' and it was great going back to @entity8 knowing i was n't going to have a problem taking on @entity3 as many times as i wanted ! ' @entity4 now wears a size 10 and likes to experiment with glamorous and girlie looks @entity4 with her hair in a sleek side ponytail and wearing a structured crop top ( l ) and in a more casual denim shorts and t - shirt for a daytime look ( r ) after losing the weight with @entity70 @entity4 pictured in fancy dress with friends on a night out after her weight loss			1
