by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 08:07 est , 28 may 2012 workers who commute more than ten miles to work each day are at greater risk of suffering from heart disease , diabetes or cancer , researchers have warned			1
long - distance commutes can be particularly hazardous to health and are linked to increased weight , bigger waistlines and lung fitness , according to a study			2
and scientists at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , claim that travelling just 15 miles to work are at more likely to be obese and not getting enough exercise			1
road to bad health : workers who commute more than ten miles to work each day are at greater risk of suffering from heart disease , diabetes or cancer lead researcher @entity25 said : ' the study is the first to show that long commutes can take away from exercise and are associated with higher weight , lower fitness levels and higher blood pressure			1
' all of these are strong predictors of cardiovascular disease , diabetes and some cancers			0
' the researchers based their results on the health of 4,300 commuters in the @entity43 - @entity42 and @entity44 areas of @entity45			1
@entity47 census figures show that over the past four decades , @entity47 are commuting longer distances , with an average commuting time of 20 to 25 minutes			0
however , dr @entity25 and her team calculated the shortest commuting distances by road for the workers , who live in areas where about 90 per cent of people travel back and forth to work by car			2
they also tracked their heart and lung health , body mass index ( @entity63 ) - which is a measure of weight relative to height - waist circumference , blood pressure , cholesterol levels , triglycerides , or fat in blood , and blood sugar levels of the commuters , as well as their physical activity			1
fifty - one per cent of the people in the study travelled ten miles or less to work each way , and 18 per cent travelled more than 20 miles			1
the average commute was 12 miles			2
the researchers found that long commutes were associated with less moderate or vigorous exercise , greater @entity63 and larger waists and higher blood pressure			2
' it looks like the threshold was a commute distance of ten miles for blood pressure , ' said dr @entity25 , adding it started to change with that distance			0
@entity88 was associated with a commute of more than 15 miles			1
the researchers found no differences in the findings between men and women and different age groups			0
dr @entity25 suggested the long commutes and more time spent behind the wheel reduce how time much people exercise			0
she said : ' for folks that live a long way from work they need to find ways to build physical activity into their day			0
' driving to work has become a part of @entity47 life			0
there is no reason why taking walks during work breaks ca n't become a part of @entity47 life too			0

travelling just 15 miles each way to work leaves commuters more likely to be obese
researchers studied health of 4,300 commuters in the @entity43 - @entity42 and @entity44 areas of @entity45
