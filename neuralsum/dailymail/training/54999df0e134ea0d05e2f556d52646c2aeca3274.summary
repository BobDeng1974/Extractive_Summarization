when the tendrils of a neighbour ’s clematis started creeping into his garden , @entity0 decided to give it a trim			1
after climbing a step ladder , he said he carefully snipped off a 4in section of the hedge – knowing it was his neighbour ’s pride and joy			0
so he was ‘ gobsmacked ’ when the 45ft - long plant slowly folded over and collapsed into a large heap on the ground			1
before : the wall in @entity17 's back garden decorated with the clematis bush prior to the trimming after : here it is pictured after @entity0 and @entity21 trimmed it from the neighbouring property @entity0 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) pictured outside court , where they were found guilty of criminal damage now , the secateur - wielding pensioner has ended up with a criminal record at the age of 86 after magistrates decided he and a fellow octogenarian ‘ accomplice ’ had cut down the clematis on purpose			1
the row has shattered the tranquillity of the smart bungalows in the seaside town of @entity39 , @entity40			0
a court heard @entity0 ’s green - fingered neighbour , @entity17 , 76 , had an immaculate garden with honeysuckle and climbing roses			1
but the crowning feature was the clematis			0
planted to celebrate the birth of her youngest grandchild , it had grown for 18 years on a wall adjoining @entity0 ’s property			1
but after taking exception to the ever - expanding plant , he and another neighbour , @entity21 , 81 , took matters into their own hands			2
first , they removed several plastic ties attached to it			0
then @entity0 used his secateurs to snip off the 4in section			1
‘ to my astonishment , the clematis wobbled a bit then folded up and descended very slowly , ’ said @entity21 , a retired teacher			2
‘ it curled downwards until it all collapsed			0
’ the clematis bush ( pictured ) had been planted to celebrate the birth of her youngest grandchild but as soon as it was trimmed , the bush immediately folded over and collapsed ( pictured ) when the police were called , @entity17 ( pictured left and right ) was found ' crying , shaking and very upset ' @entity17 ( pictured ) had a new fence built to try after her old separating wall was left looking ruinous the owner of the clematis , mrs @entity17 , told @entity79 magistrates she came home on june 18 to find @entity21 standing on an aluminium ladder while leaning over the fence and cutting her plants			1
‘ i asked her to stop and she told me to get back in and shut my cakehole			0
the whole length was being cut away , she was just telling mr @entity0 what to do when he was on another ladder			2
’ as she watched in horror , the clematis slowly collapsed			2
police were called and found mrs @entity17 ‘ crying , shaking and very upset ’			0
@entity90 , a gardener who examined the damage , said : ‘ all the plants had been cut in many places , mainly evergreen clematis but others such as roses which had grown into the clematis			0
’ however , @entity0 blamed mrs @entity17 ’s gardening skills , saying : ‘ the whole cause of this was that proper clematis frames had not been put in			1
’ @entity102 , defending , told the court @entity0 and @entity21 thought the plant would be supported , even though the ties had been cut			2
the clematis bush had to be pulled off the fence and binned ( pictured ) after it was ruined by the trimming ‘ accidents do happen , ’ he said			2
‘ but is it a criminal offence ? stupidity or lack of imagination should not lead to conviction			0
at this stage of their lives their primary concern will be the loss of their good character			0
’ but chairman of the bench @entity125 said : ‘ we find the prosecution evidence was compelling and the damage was deliberate			0
’ @entity0 and @entity21 were found guilty of criminal damage , given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay a total of £ 808 compensation to their neighbour as well as court costs			1
after the day - long trial , mrs @entity17 smiled and said : ‘ i ’m just relieved it ’s all over			1

pensioner @entity0 , 86 , decided to trim the plant using secateurs
but when he and a *friend* began trimming it , the plant slowly folded over
he said he was ' gobsmacked ' when the 45ft - long bush collapsed
the plant was a clematis , which is a climber and can live for *35* years
it was planted by @entity17 to celebrate birth of her grandchild
@entity0 and his fellow octogenarian now have records for criminal damage
