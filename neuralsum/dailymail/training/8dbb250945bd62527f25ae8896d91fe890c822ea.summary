the @entity1 administration is on the verge of proposing long - awaited rules for commercial drone operations in @entity6 skies , but key decisions on how much access to grant drones are likely to come from @entity10 next year			1
@entity12 officials have said they want to release proposed rules before the end of this month , but other government and industry officials say they are likely to be delayed until january			1
meanwhile , except for a small number of companies that have received @entity12 exemptions , a ban on commercial drone flights remains in place			1
even after rules are proposed , it is likely to be two or three years before regulations become final			2
that 's too long to wait , say drone industry officials			2
every year the ban remains in place , the @entity6 loses more than $ 10 billion in potential economic benefits that drones could provide , according to the @entity32 , a trade group			1
' i think @entity10 understands that , and hopefully they 'll take steps in the coming year to address that			1
' that appears to be what some key lawmakers have in mind			2
' we in @entity10 are very interested in @entity74 , ' @entity72 @entity71 rep. @entity71 , chairman of the @entity73 , said at a hearing this month , referring to unmanned aerial systems , or drones			1
' we understand @entity74 are an exciting technology with the potential to transform parts of our economy			0
... it is our responsibility to take a close look			0
' one of the committee 's first priorities next year is writing legislation to reauthorize @entity12 programs and overhaul aviation policy			1
the bill is expected to include directions from lawmakers on how to integrate drones into the nation 's aviation system			0
the last reauthorization bill , passed in 2012 , directed the agency to integrate drones by sept. 30 , 2015 , but it 's clear the @entity12 will miss that deadline			2
the @entity12 is expected to propose restricting drones weighing less than 55 pounds to altitudes below 400 feet , forbid nighttime flights and require drones be kept within sight of their operators			0
drone operators may also be required to get pilot 's licenses , a possibility already drawing fire from critics who say the skills needed to fly a manned aircraft are different from those needed to operate a drone			2
@entity71 indicated he 's concerned that requiring pilot 's licenses might be burdensome and unnecessary			1
and keeping drones within sight of operators would be too strict and limit their usefulness , he said			0
the reason for keeping drones within line of sight is that they do n't yet have the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft			0
@entity32 , the drone industry trade group , recently hired @entity131 , former legislative director to @entity133 @entity132 rep. @entity132 as its government relations manager			2
@entity132 is chairman of the @entity135 , which will write the @entity12 reauthorization bill			0
@entity137 : @entity73 chairman rep. @entity71 , a @entity72 @entity140 ( left ) will lead congressional efforts to clarify what 's permitted and what 's not open season : vehicles like this rescue drone flown by the @entity147 , @entity148 , are available on the open market and could soon be legal for companies to send into the sky for a variety of tasks some drones available over-the - counter in the @entity157 sell for as little as $ 44 and they flew off shelves this month as @entity159 cheap as £ 28 , they 're @entity159 must - haves -- but in october one had a near - miss with a plane near @entity162 's @entity161 ' we 're really looking at an incremental approach still , ' @entity131 said			1
' it 's not something that is going to happen overnight			0
' @entity12 officials have been working on drone regulations for nearly a decade			2
the agency twice drafted regulations that were later rejected by the @entity171 or @entity172			0
the @entity12 has long maintained that unmanned aircraft must meet the same regulations as manned aircraft unless waiving or adjusting those regulations does n't create a safety risk			0
however , @entity12 officials more recently have begun talking about ' risk - based ' regulations , giving industry officials hope the agency might propose a blanket exemption from regulations for the smallest drones – usually defined as weighing under 5 pounds – as long as operators follow a few basic safety rules			1
@entity187 authorities recently approved a blanket exemption for very small drones			0
@entity10 already is getting pushback from private and commercial pilots who worry about possible collisions			1
the @entity12 receives reports nearly every day about drones sighted flying near manned aircraft or airports			0
' as a ( @entity199 ) 737 captain , i 'll be damned if myself and 178 other people are taken down by a 12 - pound or a 50 - pound or a 150 - pound piece of metal coming through my windshield , ' said @entity204 at a recent forum hosted by the @entity206			1
' there are too many near misses occurring every day like this			0
' menace : commercial pilots are alarmed at a series of near - misses near @entity162 in which drones came perilously close to airliners really ? a drone engineer built a flying christmas tree in @entity218 this year using a 1.5 @entity220 motor @entity221 , president of the @entity222 , which represents private pilots , said online videos show that ' operators are flying near airports , in the clouds and in congested airspace			1
' he called such actions ' reckless ' and said they will inevitably lead to a collision			0
@entity12 regulations permit recreational users to fly small drones as long as they stay at least 5 miles away from an airport , limit flights to less than 400 feet in altitude , keep the aircraft in line of sight and fly only during the daytime			2
last week , drone industry trade groups teamed up with the @entity12 and model aircraft hobbyists to launch a safety campaign aimed at amateur drone operations			1
the campaign includes a website where operators can find @entity12 regulations and advice on how to fly safely			0
the trade groups said they also plan to distribute safety pamphlets at industry events and are working with manufacturers to see that safety information is enclosed inside the package of new drones			1
retailers say small drones , which are indistinguishable from today 's more sophisticated model aircraft , were popular gifts this @entity159 .			0

@entity1 administration prepares to issue drone rules for commercial companies like @entity36 and @entity62
@entity10 might have the last word
industry groups *complain* delays in finalizing regulations cost the country $ 10 billion per year
most companies are banned from sending drones into the skies , but smoe haev exemptions
key @entity71 says his committee will make drone legislation one of its first priorities in 2015
one pilot *complain*ed that airliners can be ' taken down by a 12 - pound or a 50 - pound or a 150 - pound piece of metal coming through my windshield '
