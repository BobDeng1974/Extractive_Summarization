six suspected @entity1 terrorists thought to be behind a string of bomb attacks in @entity4 are facing new police probes after the government withdraw controversial letters insisting they were no longer wanted			1
the fugitive paramilitary suspects had all received so - called ' comfort letters ' under a peace deal negotiated by @entity11			1
telling them they could return to the @entity4 without fear of being charged			2
but the letters only came to light last year after the collapse of the terror trail of @entity1 suspect @entity17 , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the 1982 @entity20 bombing in @entity21			1
@entity11 negotiated a deal with @entity23 in which on - the - run terror suspects not wanted by police received ' comfort letters ' the case against mr @entity17 was thrown out after he produced a letter from the government telling him he was no longer wanted and was free to travel to the @entity4			1
in the fall - out from the trail 's collapse , government ministers launched an inquiry into the letters – and insisted they were not ' get out of jail free cards ' for terrorists			2
following the government 's intervention detectives now believe these ' comfort letters ' do not protect suspects from prosecution , documents leaked to the @entity44 reveal			1
the @entity45 wrote to mps on the @entity48 affairs select committee last week , revealing the major new phase in its inquiries into the ' on the run ' cases			0
in the letter , @entity54 , the assistant chief constable , said the @entity45 did not believe there was any barrier to prosecuting ' on the run ' suspects who had been sent ' comfort letters ' – because @entity40 ministers have recently said the letters had no legal force			1
' whilst prosecutorial challenges may still lie ahead , the obstacles to investigating , arresting and charging suspects appear to have been removed , ' mr @entity54 said			0
the @entity45 will ' prioritise ' re-examining the cases of 36 ' on the runs ' whose status was changed from ' wanted ' to ' not wanted ' during the scheme run by mr @entity11 's government under which mr @entity17 was mistakenly given a letter of assurance			2
it is understood that ' comfort letters ' were given to suspects in the @entity78 car bomb in 1983 , which killed six and injured 90 , and the @entity79 in @entity80 in 1987			1
@entity11 said the peace process with @entity23 leader @entity82 ( right ) and @entity83 would have collapsed without the letters other atrocities under investigation could include the @entity88 bombing , in which seven military bandsmen were killed , on the same day as the @entity20 bombing in 1982 , and the 1984 @entity92 bomb , which targeted the @entity93 where @entity96 's @entity95 members were staying , killing five people and injuring 34			2
it comes as mps prepare to publish a year - long inquiry into the ' comfort letters ' scheme			2
as part of the peace deal bringing an end to the conflict in @entity48 , @entity1 terrorists serving prison terms were let out of prison early			0
but this left the problem of fugitive terror suspects who had never faced trial			0
in a controversial agreement was reached between mr @entity11 and @entity23 , police checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted would be sent a letter informing them of that fact			0
@entity1 terror suspect @entity17 was wrongly sent an immunity letter mr @entity11 has insisted that only those individuals who were genuinely not wanted by police , and were therefore not going to face trial , were supposed to have received @entity124			1
he also insisted the scheme was ' not secret ' , even though leading @entity48 politicians , including @entity127 , who was @entity128 from 1998 to 2002 , and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it			0
for the past 12 months , mps on the @entity48 affairs select committee have been investigating the on the run scheme			0
in a report to be published on tuesday , the committee is expected to raise questions over whether the policy of sending ' comfort letters ' to @entity1 suspects during mr @entity11 's final months in office was lawful			1
mr @entity11 has insisted the @entity48 peace process would have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects – the so - called ' on the runs '			1
the scheme , set up by the @entity150 government in 1999 , assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police			0
some 95 recipients of the so - called ' comfort letters ' were linked to almost 300 murders			1
under hostile questioning from the @entity158 affairs committee , mr @entity11 refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ' get out of jail free ' cards			0
he told @entity132 : ' if i had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all … i think it is likely that the peace process would have collapsed , ' he said			0
' i wanted to put the death , destruction , terrorism and misery to an end			0
i could n't bring back those people who had died during the @entity175 but i was trying to make sure there would not be further victims			0

fugitive paramilitary suspects had received so - called ' comfort letters '
' on the runs ' not wanted by police were told they could return to the @entity4
letters *emerged* in trial of @entity20 bomb suspect @entity17
but the government have insisted the letters do not provide immunity
the police have now *confirmed* they are probing six @entity1 suspects
