by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 on the hungover morning after the @entity5 - winning night before , @entity3 ’s chief of police reported : ‘ there were 12 million people rejoicing in the centre of @entity9 last night - and not a glass was broken			1
’ in the pregnant hours before @entity11 set the ball rolling for their @entity13 do @entity15 the people of @entity17 , never mind the odd cracked beer bottle , are fearful of half their city being smashed to smithereens			0
@entity3 1978 provided the most intense , passionate and atmospheric finals in the history of the greatest sporting show on earth			1
party time : @entity3 fans shower their team in ticker tape following their first @entity5 win in 1978 avalanche : supporters show their pleasure when @entity35 finally elected to bring football back to the spiritual home of the beautiful game for the first time since 1950 , it did so in expectation of @entity11 staging an even more captivating and colourful spectacle than their fiercest and closest of nationalistic rivals			1
not protesters and riot police on the streets			0
not @entity48 strikes crippling public @entity49 the hypnotic rhythms of the samba would drown out those haunting echoes of the melancholy tango from 36 long years ago			0
@entity3 started their home cup of dreams against the nightmare background of that country ’s @entity59 , in which thousands of opponents of the ruling military junta disappeared			1
mothers and wives were gathering daily outside @entity66 ’s old pink palace , the @entity67 , wailing for information about their lost loved ones			2
at the opening match of the @entity5 those political prisoners who had not been buried in mass graves or pushed out of aeroplanes over the @entity74 could hear the roars of the crowd from their concentration camp , a mile from the @entity78			0
yet from this grim beginning – more ghastly even than the poverty afflicting swathes of the @entity11 people - arose a vast ground - swell of euphoric , patriotic support of their football heroes			1
the wait is over : @entity88 raises the @entity5 in @entity9 after a 3 - 1 win over @entity90 as a consequence the @entity5 became a powerful tool for international exposure of those atrocities			2
one man , perhaps more than any other , made that possible			0
not a civil rights campaigner			0
not even @entity98 with the goals which gave @entity3 their first @entity5			1
@entity100 – that charismatic , chain - smoking manager of the team – was to become the visible proof that you could defy the @entity104			1
the incurable romantic that he is , @entity100 had no intention of selecting players from the most successful club in his country – because their achievements relied more on foul means than fair			1
@entity112 , under cynical coach @entity111 , had kicked their way to everything from the @entity116 championship to the fore - runner of the @entity118 and been branded the @entity119 of @entity9			2
with the exception of @entity121 , the odd - man - out as a stylish full back whose temporary transfer to @entity125 he helped expedite before naming his squad , @entity100 rejected all @entity111 ’s players			1
defiant : @entity100 only picked @entity121 from @entity112 and won the @entity5 cavalier : @entity129 the generals , in their hope of a sporting triumph to distract attention from their crimes against humanity , were outraged			1
when @entity100 refused to compromise , he was threatened with execution if he failed to win the @entity5			1
@entity100 shrugged , lit another cigarette and carried on about his business			1
thus he became the standard bearer not only for the @entity5 fantasy but also the resistance to @entity3 ’s @entity145 the metropolis to the mountains , from the sea - shore to the @entity149 , the country wrapped itself in flags of blue and white			1
the entire nation rallied behind @entity100 and his team			1
stars like @entity129 were @entity100 ’s lieutenants in what was now a multi-dimensional crusade			1
they strove to play cavalier football in the idiom of their @entity162 manager , coupled with a dynamism which galvanised their fellow countrymen			2
football fever raged and not only at their own games roaring crowds waved a fond farewell to a @entity172 of split personality – drew with @entity174 , lost to @entity175 yet beat @entity90 too late – kissed goodbye to @entity176 ( @entity178 et al ) and said a relieved goodbye to @entity180			2
unbelievable : @entity182 keeper @entity181 lies beaten on the ground after @entity174 's @entity184 hit what proved to be the equaliser for @entity3 , if they were to deny arch - enemy @entity11 , the door to the final had to be unlocked by at least four goals against @entity175 in what was then the second group stage			1
after they scored six the accusations of bribery and corruption came thick and fast			0
those suspicions were never substantiated and did @entity3 less than justice			1
if @entity175 were selling the game then they were incredibly deceptive and accurate in the way they went about doing so			0
they hit the inside of a post twice before @entity3 scored and came scorchingly close again before the hosts reached their optimum score			1
from that day to this every @entity210 who took part has vehemently denied the allegations			0
nor are those slurs consistent with @entity100 ’s idealism , the sense of honour with which @entity218 is imbued , the heroic leadership of captain @entity88			1
the people believed not a word of it , focusing instead on the challenged about to be presented by the @entity224 on the banks of the @entity226			0
@entity227 had refused to travel to @entity228 following death and kidnap threats to himself and his family			0
but @entity232 was still alive , well and in the final , for the second time running following defeat by @entity180 four years earlier			0
the kick - off was delayed as @entity3 questioned the legality of a the plaster cast which @entity90 forward @entity238 came out wearing to protect his damaged wrist			1
it did appear to present a risk to opponents but was allowed			2
high tempo : @entity244 in action for @entity90 as @entity246 ( left ) and @entity121 ( right ) watch in the @entity5 final the @entity224 protested that the lengthy dispute had raised the tension and volume of a crowd obviously hostile to them			0
for certain this @entity5 was about to come to a cacophonous crescendo and the response to the opening goal from @entity98 was ear - bursting			2
there was an animal howl of anguish as @entity260 equalised eight minutes from normal team and the closest we came to silence was when @entity264 struck an @entity116 post in the dying seconds			0
the jubilations began when @entity98 scored his sixth of the tournament , in extra time , and raised the roof when a clincher from @entity273 followed			0
as hundreds of thousands hurried to reach the downtown , the eight lanes of the highway from the stadium as well as the sidewalks and the grass verges came to a bumper - to - bumper standstill			1
most of us walked in the last couple of miles over the backs of trucks and the roofs and bonnets of cars and buses , without our feet touching the ground			0
the @entity293 were to move to the forefront of the military ’s agenda thereafter , provoking a war with @entity299 ’s @entity298			2
and those specks of land remain an issue between us , as we have been reminded this week by the latest @entity116 team posing behind a @entity293 banner on arrival in @entity11			0
support : @entity3 players hold a banner saying : " the @entity293 are @entity116 " before their @entity5 warm - up against @entity310 but on that night in july 1978 a people who had been made to feel unclean by their sinister generals were given back their pride by the courageous idealism of a football manager and his players			1
two evenings later @entity100 invited me to join them at a private celebration in a small hotel			2
weeks earlier , as the public responded to his defiance of the dictators , he had promised that if @entity3 won the @entity5 he would run with his people through the streets			2
@entity100 asked all we who were present to remove our jackets and shirts ( mercifully i was a lot younger then ) and @entity88 handed out blue and white scarves for us to tie as bandanas around our foreheads			2
the word was out on the streets and thousands were waiting			0
out we went to run in a huge phalanx along the main boulevard of @entity9 , the @entity339 , around the monument to the @entity116 , the @entity337 , and back to the bar			0
there was not a hint of trouble , not a swear word out of place ... and not a glass broken			0
the experience was exhilarating and the time it took for the heart to stop beating sends a message down the years to the samba drummers and dancers of @entity11 2014			0
no , do n’t stop the carnival .			0
