in her latest court salvo , miss @entity5 states : ‘ i have seen @entity30 ’s recent “ emphatic ” denial that prince @entity0 had sexual contact with me			1

‘ details of those claims have been widely reported in the @entity179 press ( with varying degrees of accuracy ) as have your denials of the claims , so i assume that it is unnecessary for me to be any more specific about the proposed areas of our inquiry			1
