' i ca n't leave @entity34 without points , but i 've felt the same thing for the last seven races , ' he said			0

off track : @entity3 , pictured in practice yesterday , missed the majority of saturday morning 's session ' but i 'll just continue to race the way i do			1
i 've always raced hard and i feel that is what i 've been hired to do			0
' that 's what i 've done since i was a kid , and it is what has got me to where i am , so i do n't see anything has changed in that respect			2
' i feel it 's important for me not to change			0
the team have hired me to win the championship , to get them as many points as possible and to bring the car home			0
' i have generally been doing that every race			0
if you look at my 150 - odd races , i have brought it home in a large portion of those			2
that 's what i do , and that 's what i plan to do moving forwards			0

@entity3 will be *allocated* a five - place grid penalty if gearbox is changed
