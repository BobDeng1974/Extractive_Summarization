white sand beaches , azure waters , minimal crowds and authentic local cultural experiences - a wish list for many when it comes to the perfect holiday and also , remarkably , just some of the features of the least popular destinations in the world			1
while @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 make up the top five most visited nations on the planet with tourist arrivals in the tens of millions some of the most incredible landscapes in the world were largely avoided by international tourists in the past year			1
for some places , such as @entity24 in the @entity25 and @entity26 in the @entity25 , geography is a major barrier to them being a place appreciated by millions rather than the few thousand who make the effort to grace their shores			1
for others , the reasons are n't so clear			0
here are the 10 destinations out of those the @entity37 @entity39 's 2014 survey of international arrivals gathered information from , which attracted the least visitors last year			1
10 ) palau 2013 visitors : 105,000 location can be the only reason this independent archipelago nation with a population of 21,000 stretched across its 250 islands in the @entity25 is on this list			1
if @entity52 or @entity53 flew here it would be teeming with tourists			2
but since they do n't , to get to its most populous island , @entity59 , from the @entity60 we must fly through @entity61 , @entity62 and / or @entity63 - it 's instead beautifully peaceful and brimming with exotic wildlife			1
usually those who make the effort to get here do so to dive among its stunning coral reefs , wrecks , caves and more than 60 vertical drop - offs in water stacked with brightly - coloured tropical fish and sea creatures , including giant fluted clams that weigh over 500 pounds			2
on land , visitors encounter exotic birds , orchids aplenty , crocodiles and incredibly friendly locals			2
signs instruct them to @entity86 ( @entity87 )			0
between @entity112 and @entity113 it has n't had the best of times since it became independent from the @entity116 in the early 1990s			0
it has n't moved on much since then with civil war and financial instability putting efforts to bring in outsiders on the backburner			0
but with that , for some , may come its charm			0
an unaffected snapshot of @entity116 times in @entity127 ( which does n't operate under @entity105 control ) , unspoiled if unremarkable landscapes , a unique history , impressive cave monasteries and an active wine industry , with tours available to visitors , are some of its limited attractions			1
a stone cross stands out atop the @entity138 in @entity105 , a small @entity139 nation between @entity112 and @entity113 that is largely avoided by tourists unspoiled landscapes and wine are among @entity105 's greatest attractions that less than 100,000 visitors took advantage of in 2013 8 ) @entity146 2013 visitors : 78,000 @entity146 is another nation on the list that 's had a tumultuous time politically , but that is stunningly unspoiled in parts and is well worth seeing before it gets on the tourist radar			1
@entity153 , sea and secluded sand are on offer along with mountains for trekking and cycling			0
with all of the local government 's budget dependent on oil , this nation north of @entity160 is slowly battling to carve its own identity since gaining independence from @entity167 in 2002			2
a small church is elevated on a hill in the midst of an incredible mountain landscape near @entity172 , @entity146 traders sell fish in the @entity176 commercial district of @entity177 , the capital of @entity146 courtesy of @entity179 7 ) @entity180 2013 visitors : 78,000 a @entity183 paradise without the crowds can be found in @entity180 , which suffers for its dearth of white sandy beaches and mass resorts			1
the volcanic island , not to be confused with @entity190 's neighbour the @entity191 , is in the lesser @entity192 and terrific for trekking , relaxing in sulphur springs and snorkelling			0
but while the locals are beyond delighted to have you there , with tourism a big money spinner for the nation , a bare minimum take the opportunity			0
the catch is a lack of direct flights and a wealth of nearby alternatives better equipped to snap up the tourist dollar			0
on the southern coast of the volcanic island of @entity180 you 'll find @entity210 village , perched on the edge of a former crater @entity180 's most popular activities are focused on the water , of course			1
here are its famous volcanic air bubbles that gave inspiration for the name @entity218 6 ) @entity219 and the @entity220 2013 visitors : 72,000 get here , quick , as the above number will change			1
@entity219 is densely populated but the @entity220 , a series of 31 islands , are most certainly not - tranquil and beautiful with white sand and the bluest of blue water , and easily accessible via new ferries			1
other than bananas , tourism is the next biggest industry here and authorities are looking to expand the islands ' appeal			0
for now it 's an alternative to its more well - established neighbours , @entity238 and @entity239			2
also made famous by the @entity241 films , which were shot here			0
azure waters and white sand is a total cliche and both are found in abundances in @entity219 and the @entity220 , where there 's a host of uninhabited islands like this a couple sunbathes on a catamaran as they float through the @entity220 5 ) @entity254 2013 visitors : 69,000 while it 's postcard - perfect and another of the @entity183 islands to escape the hordes , this @entity60 overseas territory to the east of @entity258 is not at all cheap			1
a deputy of sorts to the celebrity hotspot @entity265 's , it 's clinging onto its authenticity for dear life as fancy new holiday homes pop up to take advantage of the pristine beaches			0
in @entity254 , considered a less deluxe alternative to @entity265 's , the national sport is yacht racing a single - person yacht sails out through @entity254 's @entity275 4 ) @entity276 2013 visitors : 60,000 the sixth smallest country in the world is also the richest by gdp			1
@entity276 is an outdoor enthusiasts ' playground and renowned for its incredible natural beauty and quaint villages			2
landlocked by @entity286 and @entity287 , the @entity285 - speaking principality is the only country in the world to be totally in the @entity290			0
a summer haven for hiking and cycling and snow - covered skiing perfection in winter , for those who can afford it			0
a vineyard with in @entity298 in the background in the town of @entity301 in southern @entity276 , the sixth smallest country in the world but the richest by gdp the country is renowned for its natural beauty and outdoor sports , hiking in summer and skiing in winter @entity276 boasts a vast array of cross country and alpine skiing given the entire country in situated in the @entity290 3 ) @entity26 2013 visitors : 7,000 with @entity313 to the west , @entity315 to the north , @entity317 to the east and @entity319 1,500 miles away , most people from @entity26 moved away from this beautiful little island due to its isolation			1
just 1,400 people live here , but they 're more than welcoming to the few who make the journey to visit			0
referred to as ' @entity329 ' ( short for @entity330 ) 20 per cent of the island is made up of the pristine @entity331 , so natural beauty is the best it has to offer			0
and if you 're sick of paying for the internet , it 's free here - @entity26 became the world 's first wifi nation in 2003			1
a crystal clear sea water pool inside the @entity339 near @entity340 in the @entity25 island of @entity26 a buttressed tree in the extensive and pristine rain forest on @entity26 - 20 per cent of the island is made up by the @entity345 2 ) @entity346 2013 visitors : 7,000 once a popular holiday spot , this @entity349 island has never quite recovered from a series of horrific natural disasters			1
@entity353 in 1989 hit 90 per cent of the island 's structures and in 1995 it was battered when the previously dormant @entity357 erupted			0
that destroyer is now one of its main draw cards though , along with remarkable beaches and a distinctive laid - back atmosphere			0
@entity346 is still recovering from horrific natural disasters : @entity353 in 1989 and the eruption of @entity357 ( pictured ) in 1995 the two extremes of the perfect waters off @entity346 and the reminder of the pyroclastic flow of the volcano lava that so devastated the island 1 ) @entity370 2013 visitors : 6,000 it 's in the middle of nowhere ! people often use that term but @entity370 really is , with the nearest civilisation five hours north in @entity377			1
straddling the equator in the @entity25 , it was known as the @entity380 while under @entity60 rule			2
with some remnants of the terrible battles here during @entity385 , @entity25 influence is minimal on the islands outside the main one , @entity387			2
as they have for centuries locals live on coconuts , breadfruit and fish			0
its 33 atolls , with their majestic turquoise lagoons , cover a massive 1.3million square miles of the @entity25			2
once there , explore islands on bike , boat or foot , and appreciate the world 's largest protected marine area			0
@entity370 's 33 atolls , with their majestic turquoise lagoons , cover a massive 1.3million square miles of the @entity25 remote island : locals cycle on the white sand of @entity370 , which was named the world 's least - visited destination stunning : the island , straddling the equator in the @entity25 , only saw 6,000 tourists visit in 2013			1

the @entity25 nation of @entity370 , five hours south of @entity377 , was the least visited destination in 2013
the @entity39 's 2014 report tallied the number of international arrivals
@entity183 nations @entity180 , @entity219 and the @entity220 , @entity254 , @entity346 and @entity370 are included
also on the wrong end of the visitors list are @entity424 countries of @entity24 , @entity26 and @entity146
the tiny nations @entity276 and @entity105 flew the not - so popular flag for @entity108
