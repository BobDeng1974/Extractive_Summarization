for anyone watching their weight , it could be a perfect gadget - a keyring sized sensor that can tell you exactly how many calories are in your food simply by scanning it			1
the small handheld gadget , which works with a mobile phone app , contains a spectrometer to analyse the chemical compounds in food			1
from this , its @entity18 inventors claim it can ‘ tell you the allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in your food ’			1
it works by scanning the food and uploading the data to special web server			0
there ’s an algorithm that creates a report , which is sent to a mobile phone app revealing the food ’s contents			0
the small handheld gadget , which works with a mobile phone app , contains a spectrometer to analyse the chemical compounds in food			1
from this , its @entity18 inventors claim @entity63 can tell you the allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in your food the small scanner contains a spectrometer			1
light is made up of particles called photons			0
when you beam the low - powered laser in the @entity81 scanner at the food , some of the photons are absorbed , raising the energy states of the molecules in the food			2
lower energy photons are then reflected @entity88 spectrometer inside the @entity81 scanner sorts these photons by wavelength and counts them			0
the resulting numbers , called a spectrum , describe the chemical compounds in the food			2
this spectrum is uploaded to a web server where it is analysed			0
information about the allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in the food is then downloaded to you and displayed on your mobile phone			1
‘ @entity81 analyses the findings using the algorithm and sends a report to your phone telling you the allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in the food , ’ the firm says			1
‘ it is a fast , simple , and easy - to - use way to learn what 's in your food			2
‘ @entity81 will identify allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in foods or beverages			2
’ its makers hope it will help those with allergies , as well as those on a diet			0
the inventors , @entity133 and @entity134 hope to begin selling the gadget next year , and say it will be small enough to use as a keyring			2
‘ we are pioneers in this new and exciting technology , ’ they said			0
‘ our team has successfully tested prototypes of the @entity81 system and we are moving toward production			0
’ the gadget works by scanning the food and uploading the data to special web server			0
there 's an algorithm that creates a report which is sent to a mobile phone app revealing the food 's contents and the app can also keep a diary of what a user has eaten that day @entity81 can also identify allergens , chemicals , nutrients , calories , and ingredients in foods or beverages to make life easier for allergy sufferers			1

@entity63 contains a spectrometer to analyse the chemical compounds in food
the keyring - sized *device* can also list allergens , chemicals , nutrients and ingredients in food - as well as the calories
its @entity18 creators hope to raise funds via crowdsourcing site @entity42 for the £ 180 gadget , which can even scan food through plastic
