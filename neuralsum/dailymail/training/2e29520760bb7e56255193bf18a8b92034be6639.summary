' investors should see this as a vote of confidence for the economy , ' said @entity22 , head of @entity24 investment strategies for @entity25			0
good sign : federal reserve chairman @entity27 said wednesday that the strong jobs numbers indicate that they need to buy fewer bonds next month as the stimulus appears to be working the central bank also tempered the impact of its pullback by signaling that it plans to keep short - term interest rates at record lows for longer than previously thought			1
investors had long anticipated the @entity3 would pull back on its purchases , but did not think it would happen until next year			2
because the market had grown accustomed to stimulus , some investors had worried about a decline in stocks once the market got less rocket fuel			0
instead , the @entity7 jumped 292.71 points , or nearly 2 percent , to 16,167.97 - another all - time high for the blue - chip index			0

noticeable spike : the @entity7 responded positively to the announcement , jumping up nearly 300 points immediately following @entity27 's announcement the @entity3 said it could further reduce the pace of its purchases next year if the improvement continues			1

the yield on the 10 - year treasury note was little changed			0
the @entity3 's reduction to $ 75billion a month in bond purchases is a small but significant step			1
it means @entity3 policymakers are ready to ease the extraordinary support they 've provided to the economy since the @entity98 began six years ago			1
the move ' eliminates the uncertainty as to whether or when the @entity3 will taper and will give markets the opportunity to focus on what really matters , which is the economic outlook , ' said @entity105 , a former @entity3 economist who is now head of monetary policy research at @entity107			1
but @entity105 noted that the @entity3 has not entirely pulled its support for the economy			2
by still keeping interest rates historically low , the @entity3 ' will continue to remain very supportive of risky assets , ' @entity105 said			2
positive outlook : analysts predictions are being buoyed by four straight months of hiring increases and the unemployment rate hitting a five year low in a policy statement released after its two - day meeting , the @entity3 says it will reduce its purchases of mortgage - bonds and @entity122 bonds each by $ 5billion			1
beginning in january , it will purchase $ 35billion in mortgage bonds each month and $ 40billion in @entity123			2
the bond purchases have helped keep long - term interest rates low to encourage more borrowing and spending			2

@entity27 's term as chairman ends on january 31			1
responding to a question , @entity27 said that his impending departure played no role in the decision to vote on reducing the bond purchases at the december meeting			1
the @entity3 's actions were approved on a 9 - 1 vote			2
the only member to object was @entity147 , president of the @entity148			0
he called the move premature because unemployment remains high and inflation extremely low			0

consumers are spending more at retailers			0
auto sales have n't been better since the recession ended 4 1/2 years ago			0
what 's more , the stock market is near all - time highs as inflation remains below the @entity3 's target rate			1

the @entity134 is expected to follow suit			0
one factor of concern for some members is inflation , which remains historically low			0
the @entity3 's optimal rate is 2 per cent			1
for the 12 months ending in october , consumer inflation as measured by the @entity3 's preferred index is just 0.7 per cent , well below its target			2
on board : though @entity27 was the one to announce the trimmed stimulus , @entity129 is expected tp be the @entity3 chairwoman at the time of its implementation but the @entity3 sees inflation slowly moving toward its target , according to its most recent economic projections that were released wednesday			1
the @entity3 projects inflation would range between 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent next year and could reach the @entity3 's target in 2015 at the earliest			2
@entity3 officials still project economic growth of roughly 3 per cent next year			2
but they are slightly more optimistic about unemployment , predicting it could fall as low as 6.3 per cent in 2014 , down from a low of 6.4 per cent forecast in september .			0
