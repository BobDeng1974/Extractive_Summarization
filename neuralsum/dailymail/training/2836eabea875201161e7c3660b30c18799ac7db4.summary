there are investigations going on , it is in the hands of police			0

' we have to devise a governance for the @entity16 which is fit for the future , for the scale and complexity of the organisation			2
it 's an amalgamation of many , many organisations over its 150 - year history , and we realise that it needs to change , it needs to be simpler , and that will mean changing many things			0
the one thing we do want to make sure is that members still have a voice at the heart of the @entity16			2
there are seven million members and we think their voice should be heard loud and clear , but we are open - minded about how we achieve that			0
' the review will look at absolutely everything - it will look at what went wrong , it will look at the opportunities and we will devise a governance structure that is fit for the future , involves our members and makes sure we are very efficient and highly effective in the future			0
