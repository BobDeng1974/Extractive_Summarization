a @entity1 creationist is putting the finishing touches on a full - size replica of @entity4 , which he has built according to a blueprint set out in the @entity6			1
@entity7 spent three years and more than Â£ 1.03million constructing the gigantic wooden boat - and now has his sights set on sailing it up the @entity11 for the @entity12			1
this feat of true biblical proportions was inspired by a dream mr @entity7 had 20 years ago , in which he saw part of his native @entity1 submerged in a flood like the one featured in the @entity19			2
faithful recreation : @entity7 's replica of the ark , in @entity23 , in the western @entity1 , is now open to the public miracle worker : mr @entity7 poses with two of the life - size plastic animals that live on his 450ft ark he has been obsessed with bringing the story of the ark to life ever since , @entity32 reports , and in 2004 he built a half - scale version and floated it along the country 's canals			1
long before the metric or imperial systems came along , craftsmen in various parts of the world dealt in less precise units known as cubits			0
as this was based on the length of a forearm , the exact value varies from one ancient civilisation to the next			0
it is most commonly defined as the distance from the elbow to the middle fingertip			0
the @entity6 cubit is generally thought to be about 18in , but @entity54 cubit rods measure closer to 20in			0
tourists flocked to see the smaller prototype when mr @entity7 opened it to the public , but the proceeds from admissions went straight back into funding his ambition to build a full - size ship			1
the narrative of the ark , in which @entity65 commands @entity66 to prepare for a great flood sent to purge the world of evil , specifies that the boat was 300 cubits long , 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high			2
mr @entity7 converted this ancient unit of measurement , which is based on the length of the forearm , to determine that his recreation had to be about 450ft long			1
this puts the boat , which opens to the public on monday and is nicknamed ' @entity7 ' , at more than half the length of the @entity79			2
two by two : a crocodile and cow are among the fake creatures on board the boat , which weighs almost 3,000 tons biblical proportions : a plastic giraffe pokes its head over the bow of the ark , which was inspired by a dream and though it may not be able to shelter two of every animal , as the original story dictates , it can hold 1,500 people - not to mention a menagerie of life - size plastic creatures including giraffes , elephants and donkeys , as well as a few live chickens			1
as it weighs in at almost 3,000 tons and is made from @entity104 pine reinforced with steel , it may be hard to believe that the ark is , in fact , seaworthy			0
it is docked in the western city of @entity23 , where mr @entity7 , the owner of a construction company , pieced it together with the help of some friends and two of his children			0
in the 15th century , the city was the site of one of the deadliest floods in history , named @entity122 's flood , which is thought to have claimed as many as 10,000 lives			0
prototype : the half - scale replica that mr @entity7 built in 2004 , later floating it through the @entity1 ' canals ambition : mr @entity7 stands in front of two model elephants on his first ship in 2007 @entity19 : a mural from the mid- 16th century shows @entity65 ordering @entity66 to load two of every animal on to his ark to avoid the imminent @entity137			2

@entity7 converted ancient measurements from the @entity19 to determine that his recreation should be 450ft long
