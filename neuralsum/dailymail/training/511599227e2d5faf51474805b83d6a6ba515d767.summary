footage has revealed the sparse and yet contented life of @entity2 - the man who has chosen to live without money for the past 12 years			1
@entity2 , now 51 , renounced money in 2000 , left his last $ 30 dollars in a phone booth and walked into the desert to start a new life in @entity8 , @entity9			1
his way of life has become an inspiration to thousands of @entity13 who have suffered in the economic crash and activists like the @entity17 , disillusioned with a society consumed by avarice and greed			0
@entity25 , whose book is entitled the man who quit @entity31 , freely admits that he had lost touch with @entity2 for several years and when he heard that he was living without money , ' he thought he had gone crazy or had some kind of mental breakdown '			1
however following the economic crash in 2008 , @entity25 began to come round to @entity2 's mindset			1
@entity25 said : ' here 's someone who is saying i do n't know what the solution is but i 'm going to disobey			0
he continued : ' our financial system is so big we ca n't control it and in so many ways we feel enslaved by it			0
worse , we feel powerless to change it			0
idyllic life : @entity2 lives in the @entity9 wilderness , miles from the nearest town where he can enjoy plenty of solitude ' the fact is , if everyone lived like the average @entity13 , the world would actually collapse more quickly than if everyone lived like @entity2			1
' on his blog @entity2 describes his philosophy : ' i do n't use or accept money or conscious barter - do n't take food stamps or other government dole			1
life lessons : a long - term friend of @entity2 has followed his years without money ' my philosophy is to use only what is freely given or discarded and what is already present and already running ( whether or not i existed )			1
' ' our whole society is designed so that you have to have money , ' @entity2 added			1
' you have to be a part of the capitalist system			0
it 's illegal to live outside of it			0
' as well as quitting cash , he threw away his passport and driving license and changed his legal name , @entity84 , to @entity2 , @entity85 for ‘ soil ’			1
ever since then @entity2 has lived outdoors , camped in the wilderness , lived in caves , stayed in communes and spent nights in stranger ’s homes			2
for several years @entity2 set up home in a cave , 200 feet across and 50 feet tall , on the edge of a cliff in the @entity97 , @entity9			2
here he carved a bed out of rock , foraged for food , drank from springs and bathed in a creek			0
any hikers were welcomed to stay with him to share his ‘ home ’ , his books and the wildflowers and cactus seeds that he ate			0
born into an ultra-conservative fundamentalist family , @entity2 took his faith extremely seriously growing up			2
at college , however , he re-examined his beliefs and decided that money and the divide it creates between those who have it and those that do n’t was both unchristian and wrong			0
relying on friends : @entity2 with his long - time friend and author of his biography @entity25 back to basics : a stove that @entity2 uses to cook the roadkill he catches ( left ) and the inside of his cave in the @entity9 desert ( right ) with his minimal worldly possessions ' he wants to have the smallest ecological footprint and the largest possible impact at improving the world , ' his best friend , @entity130 , told the @entity134			1
the fact is , if everyone lived like the average @entity13 , the world would actually collapse more quickly than if everyone lived like @entity2			2
@entity25 , author '' his life goal since i met him is to take as little and give as much as possible			0
' one serious lapse from penniless living came in 2001 when @entity2 was living in a commune in @entity145 and he received $ 500 tax return in the post			1
rather than tearing the cheque up he cashed it in and spent it on driving a brand - new convertible @entity150 600 sports coupe across @entity13			0
but it was just a blip and @entity2 continues to be one of the few people who live without money by choice			2
