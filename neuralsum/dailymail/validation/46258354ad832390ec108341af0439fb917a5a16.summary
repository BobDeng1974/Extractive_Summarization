@entity0 was accused of hypocrisy last night after it was alleged that a @entity4 fundraiser had sought to bypass donation laws			1
@entity6 told an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy @entity9 businessman that he would be able to channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers			1
he was also said to have promised big donations could ‘ open doors ’ and introduced the fake donor to key figures including treasury chief secretary @entity17			1
@entity4 leader @entity0 , pictured , faces questions over his party 's attempts to bypass donation limits mr @entity17 was recorded at a dinner thanking the supposed businessman for what he was doing , adding : ‘ i wo n’t intrude on the details , but genuinely it will make a difference			1
’ all donations of £ 7,500 or more are supposed to be publically registered			2
last night sir @entity30 , former chairman of the @entity31 , said mr @entity0 ’s high - minded rhetoric on sleaze was not matched by his party ’s actions			2
‘ the leader of the party has always taken a stand on high standards in politics , ’ he said			2
‘ there ’s a conflict between what he says , and what his party is doing			2
‘ any attempt to breach legal rules around party donations is a very serious matter			1
it is most unfortunate that the @entity4 seem to be encouraging people to get round the legal provisions of party funding rules			1
you ’d expect higher standards and better leadership			0
’ last night it emerged that the @entity4 had agreed to hand back mr @entity6 ’s commons pass after accepting he should not have had one as it raised the prospect of him using the parliamentary estate for fundraising purposes			1
sir @entity30 said : ‘ it is against the rules to carry out party political campaigning in the @entity59 , so allowing him to have a pass could be in breach of the rules			0
you ’d class fundraising as party political campaigning			0
’ chief secretary to the treasury , @entity17 , pictured , thanked the undercover reporter who posed as a wealthy @entity9 businessman who was seeking to pump money into the @entity4 for the election campaign @entity81 , the party ’s election campaign leader , admitted that mr @entity6 – who yesterday quit as the @entity4 ’ general election candidate in @entity85 and is now likely to stand as an independent – had ‘ serious questions to answer ’			1
mr @entity0 told @entity87 that mr @entity17 had done nothing wrong , save being polite to someone to whom he was introduced			0
the deputy prime minister said the recording showed ‘ @entity17 being a polite guy , just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party ’			1
‘ the idea that @entity17 or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue , ’ he said			0
‘ on the issue of @entity6 , no cheque has been received by the @entity4 , no cheque has been cashed			1
if we had received this cheque in question , of course it would have been scrutinised and checked			0
’ mr @entity6 , who has also stepped down as the @entity4 race equality champion , denied any wrongdoing and said he was ‘ confident that i will be exonerated of all the claims made against me ’			2
he intends to fight the election as an independent but said he hoped to return to the party fold after clearing his name			0
the undercover reporter was apparently able to secure meetings with senior figures including mr @entity17 after giving several thousand pounds and promising far more			1
he was introduced to figures such as @entity81 , taken to mr @entity0 ’s office and attended a dinner for major party benefactors where he met mr @entity17 , the newspaper said			0
the fake donor is alleged to have been told by mr @entity6 that he could channel a donation via a ‘ cousin ’ after explaining that he wanted to remain ‘ discreet ’ about his financial support			0
he went on to hand over a cheque for more than the £ 7,500 threshold beyond which donations must be publicly registered with the @entity125			0
commission guidance , issued in 2007 in the wake of a scandal of ‘ proxy ’ donations to @entity134 , says giving money via a third party ‘ must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency ’			2
backdating a cheque could have allowed the donor to split the gift into smaller amounts of less than £ 7,500 – thus allowing him to evade declaring his name			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity125 said : ‘ we are aware of what ’s been reported and are establishing the facts before determining what further steps to take			0
