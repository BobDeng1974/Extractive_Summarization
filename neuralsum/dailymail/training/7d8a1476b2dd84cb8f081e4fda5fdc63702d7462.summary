@entity0 : love and betrayal in @entity3 1912 - 16 by @entity4 august , 1914			1
as the @entity7 , including @entity8 , are dragged into war , the atmosphere inside no 10 @entity3 is riven with emotion			2
not only , not even mainly , about the war			2
the prime minister , @entity12 , is secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age			1
@entity16 is the closest friend of his daughter @entity17 ; their letters to each other suggest a wild lesbian affection — ‘ my darlingest , how i want you ’ — or was it just their way of talking ? @entity17 is also deeply in love with her own father and determined to come between him and her stepmother , his second wife @entity26 ( her own mother died young )			1
the prime minister , @entity12 , was secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age , @entity16 @entity34 , the lavish party hostess of @entity35 , learns of her husband ’s infatuation with @entity16 and confesses her jealous misery to her confidante , @entity12 ’s young private secretary , @entity39			1
she does not realise that @entity39 , too , is madly in love with @entity16 , who is keeping him dangling			1
none of these secret couples is able to get into bed together			2
the atmosphere is electric with frustrated yearnings , to which the onset of the grimmest , greatest war takes second place			2
as i read on with increasing amazement at these carryings - on , the thought kept intruding : this is a plot that @entity53 would die for ! its participants , if not actually titled , are all rich members of the country house party set			1
@entity34 was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married her husband @entity26 ’s father made his fortune in gold mines			1
@entity26 herself , meanwhile , was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married @entity12			1
he was then a highly successful barrister and rising politician			2
he was already widowed with five grown - up children and fell for her instantly			2
s he was certainly no looker			2
her face , badly injured in an accident while out hunting , had been left with a sharp , down - turned beak of a nose and the grim mouth of a bird of prey			2
to counter this she dressed superbly in the fashionably unstructured coats and skirts and extravagant hats of the day			2
@entity16 , her much younger rival , was the daughter of @entity81			1
he had a huge estate in @entity84 , where she kept a menagerie including a bear cub called @entity87 , and she carried her pet monkey @entity89 wherever she went			2
she was described as ‘ tall , dark and handsome ’ , a description that fitted her strong but oddly masculine features			2
@entity12 , with his sharp legal mind , was stocky and always looked serenely imperturbable			1
@entity26 ’s riches and wild generosity had introduced him to the pleasures of rich food and drink			0
he liked to have daily luncheon and dinner parties followed invariably by cigars and bridge			0
as he drank steadily more , his @entity104 nickname was @entity105			0
his secret yearning was for sex			0
@entity26 , after a series of hard pregnancies and agonising births — only two of their five babies survived — had been told by doctors she must have no more children			0
contraception in those days being quite unreliable , she had closed the bedroom door on @entity12 — or anyone else			1
nevertheless , he wrote frequent letters to assure her of his undying unchanging love			1
meanwhile he was pouring out his slavish devotion in daily letters to @entity125 : ‘ i love you more than i can tell			1
i love you every hour			1
i think of you every hour			0
. you are the pole star of my life			0
my allegiance will never waver			0
’ as the war drew on he still wanted to tell her everything			0
‘ the only exciting thing in prospect , other than seeing you on friday , is what will happen in the @entity136 next week			0
this is supposed to be a secret — it is not known to some of the @entity140 ’			0
ministers at the @entity140 table grew used to being interrupted by a messenger bearing a letter for @entity12 which he would open , peruse and reply to at length			1
he then sent for the messenger to post it to @entity125			0
only then did he resume his part in the decisions affecting the life and death of thousands of men			0
@entity16 was the daughter of @entity81 of @entity156 whatever the war situation , @entity12 made time for afternoon rides with @entity125 in his chauffeur - driven @entity159 around the @entity162 parks , their knees draped in a motoring rug			1
@entity12 was notorious for giving any passing young woman a pat or a stroke and for taking a good look , if possible , ‘ down @entity172 ’ — between their breasts			1
nowadays he would have been called ‘ a groper ’ , a word not then in use			0
there is no evidence that he ever got any further , even when both of them were weekending at the same country house			0
his letters hint at how much more he would have liked to enjoy of her love			1
but @entity16 , in her late 20s , seems to have played a cool hand both with her elderly admirer ( @entity12 was in his 60s ) and her young one , @entity39			1
@entity39 was extremely rich and @entity188 but handicapped by a body of gangling ugliness and ‘ a long bony face , pitted like the surface of the moon and sombre unhappy eyes of extraordinary intelligence ’			0
add to this a fierce moustache and a monocle , and one can imagine why @entity125 turned away whenever he tried to embrace her			0
she found him physically repulsive but intellectually exciting — he was said to be a man ‘ whose ugliness was obliterated by his charm ’			0
@entity12 made him a minister — unaware that @entity39 was beseeching @entity16 every week to marry him			1
at long last she gave way — on conditions			0
first , that they would have sex only when she chose			0
second , that she could have extra-marital affairs			0
in return she agreed to convert to @entity212 — @entity39 ’s inheritance depended on his not ‘ marrying out ’			0
how was she to tell @entity12 ? and how was he to tell @entity26 ? both of them had been betrayed , and @entity16 knew the prime minister would be heartbroken to lose her			1
‘ why ca n’t i marry you and go on making him happy ? ’ she wrote plaintively to @entity39			0
‘ i want to be happy and yet not make anyone else unhappy			0
it ’s as tangled as ever			0
@entity220 , i think i love you ’			2
a @entity140 plot by @entity222 , the chancellor , removed @entity12 from the leadership when she at last tied the knot , her outraged circle assumed she was being converted just for his money — £ 10,000 a year			1
@entity12 , as she had anticipated , was devastated			1
the blow came on top of the news that his eldest , most brilliant son , @entity230 , had been killed in @entity231			0
not even he could remain imperturbably serene			0
very soon a @entity140 plot by @entity222 , the chancellor , removed him from the leadership			1
the war was being lost and @entity12 was not the man to win it			1
@entity222 eagerly replaced him and promptly moved his secretary / mistress , @entity237 , into @entity35			1
@entity12 and his long - suffering wife @entity26			1
much of the book relies on her accounts of the war and the pair 's relationship @entity4 keeps this steaming , erotic @entity245 whirling with admirable skill			1
using @entity26 ’s diaries and a wealth of letters and other sources , she brings those fraught days of war alive , weaving them into their context with an immediacy of unexpected detail			0
we seem to have been reliving 1914 for months			0
this book makes you feel you are there watching the tears fall — especially @entity26 ’s — into the emotional cauldron bubbling out of control			2
when you next look at the door of @entity35 , still a house of secrets , just imagine what mayhem was going on behind it 100 years ago .			2
