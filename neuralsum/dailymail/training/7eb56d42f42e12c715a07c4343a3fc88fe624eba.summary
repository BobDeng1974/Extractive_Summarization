by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 11:48 est , 24 january 2014 @entity3 's @entity2 has everything you need to know about @entity7 's new signing @entity8 - dubbed the ' @entity9 ' @entity7 's £ 11million move for @entity12 winger @entity11 is mired in controversy after it emerged he has twice refused to shake hands with @entity16 players			1
owner @entity17 , chairman @entity18 and director @entity19 are all @entity20 and will be concerned by @entity11 ’s actions			1
the @entity23 star , who will join @entity7 this weekend after completing a medical , refused to shake the hands of @entity27 ’s players in both legs of their @entity30 qualifiers last year			1
' it 's not a concern			0
we know the club @entity7 is			2
i know the manager i am , ' he said			0
' there are no problems with us			0
we know what owner we have and the variety of players we have			2
we can help a young boy grow up and be stable			0
' before the clash with @entity27 at @entity53 on july 30 , @entity11 left his boots by the side of the pitch and avoided the customary pre-match handshake by going to the touchline to change into them			1
@entity23 won the game 1 - 0 and flew to @entity16 for the return leg on august 6			2
@entity11 , 21 , then avoided the customary handshake with @entity27 ’s players before kick - off , but clenched his fist instead to make contact with each member of the opposition			1
he went on to score his side ’s second goal on the way to a 3 - 3 draw that ensured @entity23 qualified for the @entity30 group stages under impressive coach @entity74			2
@entity11 ’s actions will cause some discomfort to @entity7 ’s hierarchy			1
@entity17 is a frequent visitor to @entity16 and sponsors many charitable causes in the country			1
gazumped : @entity38 's side beat competition from @entity82 for the £ 11m @entity84 forward but @entity11 would counter any suggestion of @entity86 , saying he felt pressurised to appease some extreme sections of the @entity84 community			1
despite his controversial behaviour , @entity7 intend to press ahead and confirm his signing after the sale of @entity92 to @entity93 for £ 37m			1
they have agreed a fee with @entity23 and the move will be completed as soon as @entity11 has passed a medical in @entity98			2
@entity11 is a regular in the @entity12 national team and has scored 17 times in 27 appearances			2
on his way out : @entity7 midfielder @entity92 will be allowed to leave the club by @entity38 he came to @entity7 ’s attention last season with some mercurial performances in the @entity107 against @entity108 and later against @entity110 ’s side in the semi-final , when he scored in the second leg			1
@entity11 was also on target against @entity7 in both of this season ’s @entity30 group games against @entity38 ’s side			1
during his career with @entity23 he scored 20 times in 78 games and his form in front of goal has helped him win a move to @entity125			0
well - known threat : @entity11 also scored for @entity23 in last season 's @entity107 semi-final against @entity7 if you ca n’t stop ’ em , buy ’ em , right ? seems so			2
@entity7 lost home and away against @entity23 in the @entity30 this season , with @entity11 on target in each game			1
he scored the only goal at @entity53 having out - sprinted @entity135			0
so , quick then ? @entity136 is			0
he is comfortable on either wing , has good balance , sound technique , dribbles well , goes past defenders , has terrific acceleration and is especially dangerous on the break			0
he also bears a passing resemblance in looks and busy style to @entity146			0
but he ’s better than @entity146 , right ? there ’s probably more purpose and end product , granted , and he gave @entity150 a torrid time at @entity125			0
@entity11 has responded to subsequent steps up in class through the @entity155 competitions			0
so , why has n’t he been snapped up sooner ? he has been heavily scouted by @entity157 teams			0
@entity82 were keen but @entity7 have been able to scrutinise his progress since the teams met in last year ’s @entity107 semi-final			0

controversy after winger twice refused to shake hands with @entity16 players
happened in two @entity30 qualifiers against @entity27
owner @entity17 and chairman @entity18 are both @entity20
£ 11m @entity11 is dubbed ' the @entity9 '
@entity92 on his way from @entity7 to @entity93
