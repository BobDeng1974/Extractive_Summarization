the @entity0 should show its teeth and call up any players wanted by @entity3 at next summer ’s @entity4 , according to @entity6 manager @entity5			1
the question has been raised about whether @entity9 clubs would let players such as @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 travel to the @entity14 to boost the squad			2
but @entity5 , who was under - 21 assistant manager during 2007 and has @entity17 under his guidance at @entity6 , believes the @entity0 could simply apply @entity20 rules obligating players to appear for their country			1
@entity6 manager @entity5 ( above ) demands the @entity0 back @entity23 @entity11 ( right ) is eligible to represent @entity24 at the @entity4 next year ‘ i do n't think there is a debate			1
we have it completely the wrong way round , ’ he said			0
‘ the question that needs to be asked is whether the @entity0 invokes the rule it could do			1
every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant			0
‘ that stems from the fact the @entity0 do n't have the clout other federations have			1
clubs basically run football in this country			0
there has been a shift in power			1
‘ ultimately it 's whether our federation are able to invoke the clause that 's there			0
they can call them up , every other country does			0
it 's not a blame , i 'm stating what the facts are			0
@entity12 ( above ) of @entity53 in action for the @entity24 senior side could also feature @entity24 manager @entity3 ( above ) leading an @entity24 training session ‘ my interest is the club and i always encourage players to represent their countries			2
but ultimately my loyalties lie here			0
i want my players available			2
‘ i 've worked for the @entity0 and it 's very frustrating when you ca n't get your best players			1
it depends which side of the fence you sit but their are regulations out there and it 's up to the authorities to use the power if they 've got it			0

former *england* under - 21 assistant @entity5 wants @entity0 to get tough
he said ' there has been a shift in power ' and the @entity0 ' do n't have the clout '
@entity20 rules can make players appear at under - 21 *championship* next year
