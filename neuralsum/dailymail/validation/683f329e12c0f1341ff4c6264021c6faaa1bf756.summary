@entity0 has revealed two key software updates for the @entity3 sedan that he claims will end ' range anxiety '			1
the first is a ' range assurance ' app that communicates with @entity9 's @entity8 network , warning drivers if they are about to run out of power , and pointing them to the nearest supercharger			1
the second is a trip planner , which will combine the supercharger network with the network of @entity3 cars to improve long - distance journeys for drivers			1
it will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge @entity9 's updated software will map out the best route to a driver 's destination based on the location of charging stations			1

the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings			0
its built - in trip planner , meanwhile , will be more advanced , using real - time data such as wind speed and elevation			1
the announcement follows @entity0 's cryptic tweet over the weekend , in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month			0
the separate @entity85 feature should be available in the @entity86 , @entity87 , and most of @entity88 within the next 12 months			1

it can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger			2
the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings @entity0 ( left ) said that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their @entity3 once every three or four months			1
on the right is a preview of what the @entity41 will look like in a survey for @entity147 in 2012 , 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars			0
the official range of the @entity3 at the moment is up to 310 miles ( 500km ) , which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers			2
running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past			0
earlier this month @entity160 unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style			0

this was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and , at the time , @entity0 tellingly tweeted : ' should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the @entity3 , but it obviously * will * happen long - term			0
' @entity0 has since deleted that tweet - perhaps in anticipation of today 's announcement			0
