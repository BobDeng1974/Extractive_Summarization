by @entity1 reporter published : 17:24 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 17:26 est , 24 april 2013 outrageous : @entity2 claims that the government was behind the @entity5 bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured the @entity8 college professor who sparked controversy after saying that the shooting at @entity11 may not have taken place is now infuriating even more people by saying that the @entity5 bombings were an inside job			1
@entity2 , a media professor who writes extensively about conspiracy theories , said that last week 's bombing appears as if it was planned by the government			1
' the event closely resembles a mass - casualty drill , which for training purposes are designed to be as lifelike as possible , ' he wrote in a blog post			0
other topics of rumination on his site include a number of the classic conspiracy theories : the september 11 attacks , the purview of the @entity24 , the @entity25 , the death of @entity27 and @entity28 have all been of interest			0
mr @entity2 , a tenured professor at @entity36 , argues that the media and ' play actors ' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 180 injured			1
he takes particular issue with the endless stream of photos supporting the popular belief that the bombing did in fact happen			0
he writes that the multitude of pictures ' suggests the possibility of play actors getting into position after the detonation of what may in fact have been a smoke bomb or similarly benign explosive			0
' picking a fight : @entity2 argues that the media and ' play actors ' have made up the bombing that left three dead and more than 180 injured still at work : @entity2 , 47 , has been teaching at @entity36 for 10 years and refuses to lessen his stance against the official version of events regarding the @entity11 shooting ' since it is mediated , however , and primarily experienced from afar through the careful assemblage of words , images and the official pronouncements and commentary of celebrity journalists , it has the semblance of being , for all practical purposes , " real			1
" ’ @entity36 officials had a similar reaction to his latest rant as they did for the @entity11 shooting			1
' as with all postings on his personal blog , @entity36 does not agree with mr. @entity2 ’s views or opinions , ' the @entity36 spokesman said in a statement to @entity84			1
' his editorialized postings do not reflect the positions of the @entity36 or its leaders			2
' @entity88 stands with the rest of the country in our support of the victims of the @entity5 tragedy			0
we , too , are @entity95			0
' placing blame : @entity2 says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the ' truth ' one difference between his comments on the @entity11 massacre and the @entity103 bombing was the amount of time that he left in between			1
last time , he waited nearly a month after the 20 young students and six school administrators were killed at the elementary school before making his controversial comments			0
this time he waited just nine days			0
the 47 - year - old professor based his outrageous allegations largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the tragic day			2
' i think that the entire country mourned about @entity11 and yet , once again , the investigation that journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took place as far as i 'm concerned , ' @entity2 said at the time .			2

professor @entity2 asserts the bombing was a staged drill
