@entity76 , from @entity75 , said : ‘ my husband @entity57 has been dealing in vintage posters for 30 years and during that time he 's seen the price of them rocket			0
the posters are the brainchild of vintage poster dealer @entity57 , who runs a gallery in @entity60 , @entity61 ‘ they were never made to last and print runs were often very limited so very few have survived and that has driven prices up			1
‘ nowadays vintage posters are very collectable and sought after but they can sell for tens of thousands of pounds and that is beyond the means of most people			0
‘ realising this we had the idea to commission artists to create a new set of winter sports posters in the same art deco style but at a price that was much more affordable			2
