' i love this club and would love to be part of this club for the future , with the new players			1
' earlier @entity0 , speaking to the @entity11 , said : ' i came to @entity3 in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to mr @entity55 in relation to my plans for the club , i gave the names of some players			1
' big names were arriving at @entity3 in that period			2

he said : ' i am really proud for this award , in the list of previous winners there are a lot of players whom i really respect and grew up trying to reach there level , so for me this is a great honour			0
' when i came to @entity110 , things were difficult , there was the language barrier and culture change			0
' with time , we managed to learn more from each other and today i am really happy that the football writers not only understand me a lot on the pitch , but have also helped me with my foundation work			0

@entity0 added : ' throughout my career , i have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person , because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me , but if i have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man , i think in this moment i would choose @entity2			1
' ' @entity2 arrived at @entity123 for £ 24million , but he is probably the best - value @entity3 player ever , and i remember clearly how it happened			1
' i came to @entity3 in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to mr @entity55 in relation to my plans for the club , i gave the names of some players			1
' big names were arriving at @entity3 in that period			2
the previous summer , for example , @entity62 came from @entity65 and @entity66 came from @entity67 , among others , but @entity2 was unknown and the price was very , very high			2

' i was very strong to persuade my club to pay such an amount for him and i think we can already say he was the best - value signing for @entity3 in relation to what he has done for the club over so many years , and he is not finished yet			1
' my story with him started after i got @entity162 in my @entity81 group when i was manager of @entity164			0
' before we played against them , i travelled to @entity162 to watch them play @entity167 and i was amazed with the potential i saw in him			0
' when we played against them , i met him in the tunnel before the game and i told him , ' i do n't have money to buy you , do you have a cousin like you who is lost in @entity93 ? ' ' that was the first time that the big guy put his arm around me			0
he told me , ' in @entity164 , you do n't have money to buy me , but if you move to another club where you do have money to buy me , then i will go with you			0
' ' after the @entity81 final with @entity164 at the end of that season , i moved to @entity3 and immediately began the process to sign him			2
' reflecting on our relationship , i have three moments in my mind that best characterise the man – because @entity2 the man is just as great as @entity2 the player			1
' the first one was when i met him at @entity193 when he was landing to sign for @entity3			2
the way he hugged me , and the way he thanked me was not normal for a player towards a manager , immediately after signing for a new club			2
@entity3 were changing his life forever in that moment , and he knew that			2
' the second moment was after we won the 2007 @entity82 at @entity203 against @entity24			0
the game finished and i went to the dressing room , leaving the players to enjoy the moment and to celebrate on the pitch			0
' i was on the phone with my wife , when suddenly a big monster ran into the dressing room and told me that if i did n't come with the players , they would n't collect the cup			0
they would only go up there with me			0
' i told him that i wanted the players to go and enjoy the moment together – that i did n't need to be there – and he said , " we are only one			0
you can come by your will , or i will carry you there ! " ' the third moment was when i left @entity3 in 2007 and i saw the big man crying like a baby			1
' so i can say that he is a phenomenal person , and i have also had the privilege to visit his country and to see what he means , not just to the people of @entity93 , but to so many @entity232 nations in that region			0
' i know what he means as a player and as a person			0
that is why this combination of the player and the person is so amazing			0
' throughout my career , i have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person , because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me , but if i have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man , i think in this moment i would choose @entity2			1
