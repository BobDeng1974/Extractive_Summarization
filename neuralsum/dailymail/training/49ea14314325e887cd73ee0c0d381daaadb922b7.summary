by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:35 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 8 august 2013 a @entity4 judge upheld murder charges wednesday against a fundamentalist @entity7 couple in their 8 - month - old son ’s faith - healing death , saying things might be different if their toddler had n't died four years ago ‘ under strikingly similar circumstances			1
’ @entity14 and @entity15 were still on probation after the 2009 death of their 2 - year - old son @entity18 , for which they were convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
in april , @entity23 died of pneumonia after the couple decided to pray over the infant rather than take him in for medical care , according to their police statements			1
their probation required them to seek immediate medical help if another child was sick or injured			2
‘ we 've been here before ... under strikingly similar circumstances			0
’ defense lawyer @entity52 argued that @entity23 died just three days after he came down with cold and flu symptoms and said there was no evidence of malice , as required for third - degree murder			1
‘ a reasonable parent probably would wait three days to take their child to a doctor , ’ said @entity52			0
again ? the @entity62 had previously been convicted of manslaughter in the 2009 death of their 2 - year - old son under circumstances prosecutors called ' eerily similar ' ‘ we tried to fight the devil , but in the end the devil won , ' the couple told homicide detectives investigating @entity23 ’s death , which could have been prevented with basic medical care			1
@entity41 seemed especially troubled that @entity23 had increasingly labored breathing but still got no medical care			0
he compared the current case to that of a parent who repeatedly gave a child peanut butter despite knowing of a potentially deadly allergy to it			0
‘ how many times do you have to do that again before a child dies , and a jury can infer legal malice ? ’ @entity41 asked			0
‘ is it a second time , or is that not enough ? is it a third time ? ’ about a dozen @entity92 children die each year when parents turn to faith healing instead of medicine , typically from highly treatable problems , according to experts			1
faith - healing : @entity98 , where the parents are members , says using medicine is a sin murderers ? @entity4 district attorney @entity102 , announces @entity14 and @entity15 would be charged with murder			1
the judge upheld the charge wednesday , despite strong objection from the defense the @entity62 are third - generation members and former teachers at the @entity98 , a small , insular congregation in northeast @entity4			1
‘ we believe in divine healing , that @entity114 ... died on the cross to break the devil 's power , ’ @entity110 told homicide detectives after @entity23 died			1
@entity4 district attorney @entity102 said the care was never given and decided to bring murder charges against the couple			0
their remaining seven children have been placed in foster care			0
extreme : pastor @entity125 of the @entity98 tells followers to shun 21 - century medicine for the power of prayer ‘ he is incarcerated because of his faith , ’ said lawyer @entity52 in may when the couple was ordered held without bail			1
he described client @entity110 's mindset as resolute			2
‘ we believe in divine healing , that @entity114 shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil 's power , ’ @entity110 told @entity4 homicide detectives in april			1
@entity143 , he said , ‘ is against our religious beliefs			0
’ ‘ these are people who have been brought up in these communities ; their beliefs are reinforced every day , ’ said @entity144 , a @entity145 lecturer who has studied faith - healing deaths			2
‘ they 're not trained intellectually to question these doctrines , where the rest of us might engage in critical inquiry , weighing the benefits of medicine versus the benefits of prayer , ’ he said			1
@entity144 is n't sure that courts have the means to prevent the problem , since such people do n't fear legal punishment , only @entity163			0
some believe death ‘ is a good outcome , ’ given their belief in the afterlife , he said			0
‘ they do n't want to harm their children			0
they 're just in this particularly narrow - and very , very dangerous - way misguided about the potential of medical science , ’ he said			2
he believes that ‘ empathetic ’ intervention , through dialogue between church and public health educators , could help some ‘ get to a point where they allow their beliefs and practices to evolve			2
’ but there 's also a risk that could backfire , and drive these communities further underground , he said			2
it is estimated that around a dozen @entity92 children die in faith - healing cases each year , a handful of which spawn criminal charges , according to experts			1
the @entity98 of @entity4 ’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past			0
in 1991 , eight children died in a measles outbreak			2
all the parents were members of either @entity98 or the nearby @entity197 of @entity198 which also preaches faith - healing			0
@entity200 and @entity201 were part of a string of faith - based healing related deaths in @entity207 in recent years			0
they were sentenced to 6 years in prison in the death of their home - born son in 2011 in 2011 , @entity200 and @entity201 of @entity207 were sentenced to 75 months in prison after turning to faith healing to say their premature newborn , which was born in a family home , died from complications that could have easily been averted with medical care			1
also in @entity207 , @entity222 and @entity223 , were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 for the death of their 16 - year - old son			1
the couple refused to use medicine for their son @entity229 , who was suffering from a preventable urinary tract blockage			1
instead , they prayed and used anointing oils in the hope of divine intervention			0
' too many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full , ' judge @entity237 said at their sentencing			2
