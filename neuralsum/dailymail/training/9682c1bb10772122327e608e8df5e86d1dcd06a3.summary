@entity1 captain @entity0 admits his team may have to resort to the ‘ dark side ’ to stop @entity4 in sunday ’s televised @entity6 tie if they want to upset the @entity6 holders and have a chance of progressing to the fifth round			1
even though the @entity13 side have a reputation for playing expansive , passing football in the same style of @entity4 , the @entity11 centre half concedes that they may have to sacrifice their principles on sunday and be more physical and direct to stop @entity4			1
‘ all football teams need that , ’ said @entity0 , who was labelled ‘ brutal ’ by @entity19 striker @entity18 after a recent clash against @entity11			1
‘ you ca n’t just play football all the time			0
you need the dark stuff and we ’ve got that and i ’m sure @entity4 have as well			1
’ @entity1 skipper @entity0 has told his players to be physical during their match against @entity4 @entity18 said @entity0 was ' brutal ' after @entity19 's match against @entity11 in october 2014 but @entity0 insists that he wants @entity4 to play their best team , including @entity32 and @entity33 , even though it will make their task that much harder			1
‘ if you asked anyone in our dressing room , they would rather see the strongest team out there			2
it ’s great to see how you can compete against them			0
it ’s not something you get the opportunity to do that often			0
‘ i watched @entity4 last week against @entity47 and they were unbelievable			2
but you do n’t play football to play against people who are easy – you want to play against the very best players			0
’ and @entity1 manager @entity51 knows how @entity4 can pass their way through sides all too well			1
@entity51 was manager at @entity54 last season when @entity56 scored the goal of the season against his side – after a stunning ten - pass move			1
@entity62 manager @entity51 expects a difficult challenge against @entity4 at the weekend asked whether he could admire the artistry involved , @entity51 said : ‘ it ’s certainly not what you think at the time ! ' when you see it again you try to evaluate and see could we have stopped it at source			1
there was probably one time in the move itself where we could have done better			0
' but the last parts we could n’t have done and eventually you have to hold your hands up			0
there are times when it ’s very , very difficult to cope with @entity4			2
‘ we all know the magnitude of the job , irrespective of the team they play on sunday			0
in the past , if they made changes they had good young players to come in and the age of the team would have gone down dramatically			2
what they have now is experience and if they make changes they will have players that have played a lot of games for them			0
