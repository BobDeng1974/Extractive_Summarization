by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 19 april 2013 @entity2 's notorious @entity1 was fabled under the apartheid regime as a stronghold of steel and stone from which no prisoner could ever escape			1
but there were just two men who held the key to freedom ... and they made it out of wood			2
one quiet night on december 11 1979 , anti-apartheid freedom fighter @entity14 stretched his arm through his cell window and opened his cell door from the outside with a click			1
in his hand he held a broomstick with a wooden key he had fashioned attached to its end , like a rudimentary crankshaft			1
now : @entity14 holds the wooden key he fashioned to break out of @entity1 , left , and his escape partner @entity26 , right then : the friends were supporters of @entity29 ’s @entity28 and had been locked up in the maximum - security jail for setting off harmless leaflet propaganda bombs in a bid to spread dissent against the apartheid regime in 1970s @entity2 he silently opened the door and stepped out into the corridor before tip - toeing to the next cell to set free his best friend and accomplice @entity26			1
' it was hugely emotional , ' @entity26 , now 62 , told @entity43 from his home in @entity45			1
' this was going to let us out of the cells into the corridor			0
' but it was only the beginning			0
standing in the darkened hallway , the friends still had ten more steel - clad gates and many more ruthless armed guards between them and fresh air			2
staunch supporters of @entity29 ’s @entity28 , they had been locked up in the maximum - security jail for setting off harmless leaflet propaganda bombs in a bid to spread dissent against the apartheid regime in 1970s @entity2			1
maximum security : prison officers stand guard in the excercise yard at @entity67 , left , and the cell door which @entity26 and @entity14 broke through on the final stage of their daring prison break how it worked : the pair had made the key out of wood and attached it to a broomstick like a rudimentary crankshaft to unlock the heavy cell door @entity26 had been sentenced to eight years and @entity14 to 12			1
describing the length of time they received as ' gut - wrenching ' , @entity26 said : ' we were contemplating escape even before our conviction			1
' the men were so determined to break free that they had asked relatives to smuggle them money for taxi fares to a train station			0
a third ­ prisoner , @entity91 , was brought in to be part of the escape			0
the idea for the makeshift key came to @entity26 when he was lying on his bunk one evening and he remembered how he had learned to pick the lock of his back door of his home as a youngster			1
' i got a piece of paper and , using a knife , pressed it into the lock [ which ] gave me the depth of the lock inside - the same measurement as the key			0
' we were working in a carpentry workshop and i thought , " i wonder if we can make a key out of wood " '			0
daring : @entity14 stretched his arm out of his cell window from inside his cell to painstakingly unlock the door how it worked : how their rudimentary crankshaft mechanism worked @entity122 : they came up with a plan leave dummies - made from boiler suits stuffed with sheets - in their beds , sneak downstairs , hide in a cupboard and wait for the warder to go upstairs			1
but they would have to do it right under the noses of the guards			2
so he smuggled the parts he needed from he workshop to his cell in a flask and began work in the dead of night			0
by trial and error , he would try the key each day , using marks left on it when it jammed to work out which parts he needed to file			0
over the next 18 months the pair would slip out each night after lights out to start work on the next door , then the one after that			1
painstaking : in all , the men had to fashion 10 keys for each of the doors to the outside world the prison : @entity2 's notorious @entity1 was fabled under the apartheid regime as a stronghold of steel and stone from which no prisoner could ever escape but it was the fifth and sixth doors that would test their nerves to the point of breaking			1
these were right next to the guards ' office and they would surely be seen or heard if they tried passing through with anyone nearby			2
so they came up with an ingenious plan leave dummies - made from boiler suits stuffed with sheets - in their beds , sneak downstairs , hide in a cupboard and wait for the warder to go upstairs			1
then they would get to work as they had done already on all the other doors behind them			2
one by one , they fashioned keys for them all			2
all except the eleventh and final door , which they decided would be too risky for a dry run so it would have to be done once , on the fateful night of their actual escape			0
' we got through the nine doors and then at the final door , we found we could n’t open the lock , ' said @entity26 of d - day itself			1
but they had a plan @entity207 a chisel which they had brought along , they proceeded to attack the lock with ' tremendous noise '			0
yet still , nobody appeared to notice			0
' we were right underneath an armed guard but he did n’t see us			0
we walked out as if we had every right to be there , ' @entity26 said			2
they used their money to pay for taxis and left @entity2 and headed for @entity219			0
a huge police manhunt was launched to re-capture the fugitives , but by then they were already across the border en route to the @entity224			0
their incredible story is to be told tonight in @entity226 on the @entity227 .			0

@entity28 heroes @entity14 and @entity26 were held in @entity1 in 1978
jailed for setting off harmless anti-apartheid leaflet propaganda bombs
they fashioned wooden keys for all 11 doors over 18 months of dry runs
*fooled* guards with dummies in beds while hiding in closets until coast clear
