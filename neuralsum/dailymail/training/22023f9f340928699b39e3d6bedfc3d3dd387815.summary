girls as young as 11 ' expect ' to have to perform sex acts on rows of boys for up to two hours at a time in parts of @entity6 , a watchdog said as they warned child abuse is rife across @entity9			1
deputy children ’s commissioner @entity10 said there ' is n’t a town , village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited '			1
in one vile abuse case she uncovered , boys aged 14 and 15 were ' summoned ' via @entity17 to the gang rape of a ' very , very young girl ' which lasted several days			1
@entity20 : thousands of children the country are being sexually exploited , stunned @entity21 were told today ( picture posed by model ) she told @entity21 today : ' boys were being called while some were raping the girl to say " come , come , come , you can join in too " and they were arriving and elbowing each other out of the way to rape her			1
' ms @entity10 said the recent sex abuse case in @entity34 - which involved mostly men of @entity37 origin abusing white girls - was just part of a wider picture of exploitation involving victims and abusers of all races and cultures			1
giving evidence to the @entity48 home affairs committee , she said : ' what i am uncovering is that sexual exploitation of children is happening all over the country			0
' as one police officer who was the lead in a very big investigation in a very lovely , leafy , rural part of the country said to me : " there is n’t a town , village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited "			1
' the evidence that has come to the fore during the course of my inquiry is that that , unfortunately , appears to be the case			0
' we should start from the assumption that children are being sexually exploited right the way across the country			1
' in urban , rural and metropolitan areas , i have hard evidence of children being sexually exploited			1
that is part of what is going on in some parts of our country			0
it is very sadistic , it is very violent it is very ugly			0
' her report into the scale of child abuse is due out in september			0
giving examples from the capital , she said : ' there are parts of @entity6 where certainly children expect to have to perform oral sex on line - ups of boys , up to two hours at a time from the age of 11			1
and it was ' quite common ' for girls to be lured via internet chat rooms to meet a friend , only to be met by a group of boys and gang raped in a park			1
' then another group of boys come , they take her to another part of the park and she is serially raped again , ' ms @entity10 told @entity21			2
' i wish i could say to you that such things are uncommon but i ’m afraid they are quite common			0
' in the @entity34 case , nine @entity117 men , mainly of @entity37 origin , were found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs so they could use them for sex			0
horror : children are being targeted on @entity126 - and in one instance word of a gang rape was spread by @entity17 messenger but while it may be true that some @entity37 men saw white girls as ' easy meat ' - as suggested by a number of high - profile politicians - that was only one pattern among many , she said			1
' i regret to say that there are parts of every single community - white , @entity37 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity142 travellers , you name it - who are seeing children as easy access in terms of sexual exploitation			2
and in terms of victims we are seeing the same sort of profile			0
' ethnic minority victims were ' too often missed out '			2
the deputy commissioner told the visibly - stunned mps that ' what is being done is so terrible that people need to lay aside their denial ' or risk victims being disbelieved			1
victims numbered in the thousands not the hundreds , she said			2
she said she was ' extremely concerned ' about the role being played by the internet in enabling and fuelling abuse , and ridiculed the idea that parents could prevent access			1
young people were acting out scenes they saw in online pornography and even organising abuse via social networking sites and messaging systems , she said			2
one police force showed her a list of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 14 whom a man in his 40s masquerading as a boy had managed to make his ' friends ' on @entity126			1
' we have gathered quite a lot of evidence to show that there is no doubt that social networking sites can be a source of real problems for this , ' she said			0
she said easy access to extreme pornography was a particular concern			0
' we ’ve had boys say to us - some of the boys i ’ve spoken to who ’ve been involved in sexual exploitation - " it was like being in a porn movie "			0
' they have watched things and then they ’ve enacted them			0
' parents may think they can control what ’s going on because they can have a blockage on the computer but the reality is children can get anything they like on their mobile phones			0
it has definitely affected children ’s thresholds of what they think is normal			0
' in another case , older men were using young male gang members as a ' front line ' in a wider abuse network , and had even forced two of the boys to have sex and filmed it on a mobile phone to ensure their compliance			2
speaking about the race issue , she told the committee she had visited a ' racist ' estate in the north of @entity232 where there was routine sexual abuse of children within an all - white community			2
' i have been to gang - associated areas in the north of @entity232			1
' i am thinking of one particular estate which is exclusively white , because it is such a racist estate , where there is a very strong and identified pattern of the white males on that estate sexually exploiting the white females on that estate			0
' so it is really important to hold all of it in mind			0

@entity252 is fuelling abuse of thousands of youngsters , deputy children *'s* commissioner tells mps
boys , aged 14 and 15 , summoned to gang rape which went on for days by @entity17
' there is *n't* a town , village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited , ' she says
girls are being lured into parks by boys they meet online and gang - raped , she tells politicians
abusers and victims are from all racial and ethnic *backgrounds* , she says
blocking computers is not enough - because children are now targeted via their mobiles
