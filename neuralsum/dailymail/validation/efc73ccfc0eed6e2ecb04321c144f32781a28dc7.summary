it is supposed to be to @entity2 ’s advantage that they have to leave @entity3 only three times in what remains of the @entity7 campaign			1
really ? are we sure about that ? @entity10 always thought it was harder for a @entity3 club to win the league because there were so many derbies , and this match rather supported his theory			2
@entity2 still collected three points but , by @entity20 , it was tough			1
their defence was stretched in a way that it was not at @entity23 on sunday and , by the end , @entity2 were happy to hoof the ball forward or run it into corners to take time out of the game			1
@entity28 celebrates putting @entity2 a goal to the good after nodding @entity31 ' cross past @entity33 keeper @entity32 @entity32 dives in vain as @entity28 's header sails past the @entity37 shot stopper and into the back of @entity33 's net hazard leads the celebrations as @entity2 took another step towards winning the @entity7 title for the fourth time time stands still as @entity28 hammers his header home at @entity48 to seal the game in @entity2 's favour the @entity2 players applaud the travelling fans after clinching another victory as they maintained their five - point lead at the top @entity33 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity32 7 ; @entity56 6 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 ( @entity59 7 , 6 ) , @entity60 6.5 ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6.5 ; @entity63 7 , @entity64 7 ( @entity65 87 ) , @entity66 7 ; @entity67 7			1

check out more stats from our @entity104 @entity33 have won a single league fixture since @entity107 , but it did not look like it here			1
they had chances , real chances , to wrest the points from the league leaders , and it says much that @entity2 ’s prime performers were once again the central defensive core of @entity79 , @entity78 and @entity76 in goal			1
and @entity28 , of course			1
he scored the goal , never stopped wanting or carrying the ball , and left the field hobbling , as always , due to a standard battering			0
not that @entity33 were excessively dirty — @entity2 had four bookings to @entity33 ’s three — more that a player of @entity28 ’s ability is always going to attract a certain kind of attention			1
the group hug that @entity79 , @entity78 , @entity76 and @entity77 shared at the end should have included hazard ; in his own way , he is as hard as any of them			0
if @entity2 maintain their supremacy , this is one of those games that will be remembered the day the title is won , one of those they - shall - not - pass performances , all bodies flying , desperate lunges and the ball in row z if needs be			1
@entity33 were left banging their heads against a wall — no wild metaphor in the case of @entity64 , who ran face first into the back of @entity79 ’s skull late in the second half			0
both required treatment , but one came off considerably worse			0
@entity28 runs to @entity31 after the pair combined for @entity2 's opening strike which gave @entity93 's men a vital victory @entity32 makes an acrobatic save to keep @entity33 in the game as @entity2 threaten to extend their advantage @entity32 keeps out another @entity2 attack as he thwarts @entity161 on a busy night for @entity33 's goalkeeper @entity33 have now failed to score in six of their last seven @entity7 matches against @entity2 , including the last five in a row			1
@entity28 ’s last four @entity7 goals have come away from home after a run of 11 consecutive home goals it is fair to say if they are ever pondering a fresh material to use in the construction of those black boxes in aircraft , @entity79 ’s cranium may have to be considered			1
it is hard to remember a striker getting in so many excellent positions for such paltry return			0
he knows where to be , he just lacks the clinical touch when he gets there and , thwarted by his own failings and the excellence of @entity76 , @entity33 drew a blank			0
yes , @entity2 could have scored more , too			1
this was not a one - sided game — but we expect @entity2 pressure on the goal			2
they have world - class finishers and magicians in midfield			0
the surprise was @entity33 going toe - to - toe with them , particularly , in the second half			0
right up until the last minute they were still heaping on pressure			2
@entity2 have matches at @entity202 and @entity203 , and a home fixture against @entity205 , to come , so nobody should underestimate the challenge to their championship ambition contained in a @entity3 derby			2
this was one of the hardest - fought wins of @entity2 ’s season — every bit as much of a proving ground as a wet wednesday in @entity216 , or whatever northern outpost is the current venue for popular cliche			2
hazard is the @entity7 's most fouled player this season and he goes down after some attention from @entity61 hazard writhes around on the @entity48 pitch in agony but continued to play on for the title favourites @entity76 parries the ball with his foot as @entity62 closes in during a heart - in - mouth moment for @entity2 's rearguard @entity76 was once again called in to action as @entity33 appeal in vain for a handball against @entity78 ( floored ) @entity93 ’s favourite scoreline is apparently 2 - 0 away			1
he regards it as the sign of a controlled , confident , emphatic performance in a close game			0
they certainly went in search of it here and came very close on three occasions in the second half			0
in the 56th minute , a beautiful through pass from @entity28 set @entity31 clear on goal			1
he cut inside but his delicate side - footed finish struck the inside of the far post and rebounded into the hands of @entity32			2
minutes later , @entity33 ’s goalkeeper was in the right place again after @entity79 found hazard whose cross picked out @entity31 at the far post			1
this time there was no good fortune			0
there were six minutes of injury time due to the @entity262 collision and @entity2 came close to wrapping it up then			2
@entity28 broke , for the last time , drawing @entity32 yet squaring the ball unselfishly to @entity84 , whose shot was somehow smothered on its way to the net			1
the single goal was the fairer margin of victory , however			0
@entity33 did not deserve to appear mastered in the scoreline after a simply thrilling second half			0
@entity81 gets stuck in against @entity273 as the centre half continued to play in the holding role in midfield @entity81 continued in midfield after playing the holding role in the @entity280 final , and regularly battled with @entity62 @entity64 unsuccessfully shoots at goal under the ever - watchful eye of @entity2 skipper @entity79 @entity78 attempts to tackle @entity67 as @entity64 is poised to pounce on the loose ball the first was n’t bad either , @entity33 going close in the 17th minute , when a cross from @entity61 found a dangerous area at the near post where @entity62 caused localised chaos and @entity64 arrived late only to have his shot blocked by the shins of @entity76			1
two minutes later , a run by @entity273 opened a gap to slide a pass through to @entity67 , who missed his kick			2
more frustration was to come			0
in the 37th minute , @entity56 crossed from the right and the ball dropped perfectly to @entity67 , directly in front of goal , but planting his header into the ground , landing safely in the hands of @entity76			2
after 53 minutes , @entity76 saved from @entity67 again , pushing out a shot one - handed , just the right side of @entity62			0
he saved from @entity67 after 60 minutes , too , and when he finally spilled a @entity66 shot 12 minutes later , the outstanding @entity78 cleared as @entity67 threatened in vain			0
it was not all wastefulness by @entity33 , though			0
in the 15th minute , a mix - up by @entity77 saw @entity66 about to speed past @entity79 and go through on goal			2
the ever - alert @entity82 probes into @entity33 territory with @entity66 and @entity61 close by @entity33 werew forced into an early change as @entity58 pulled up in the eighth minute with @entity59 coming on in his place @entity93 and @entity75 share a moment prior to kick - off on a crisp night in east @entity3 the @entity2 captain weighed the odds in a split second and hauled him down , rugby style			1
did he prevent a goalscoring opportunity ? probably			0
did he play the percentage chance of referee @entity96 showing him a red card 30 yards out and early in the match , with @entity78 covering , if not really in a position to stop ? undoubtedly			0
did he get away with it ? yes			0
it was a cynical move , but the smart one , too			0
it was seven minutes later that the winner was scored			0
to be beaten by a header playing @entity2 is no disgrace ; when the man on the end of the ball is @entity28 , however , a manager has a right to be aggrieved			1
@entity75 certainly looked it as the @entity2 man completed a headed goal that was as casually taken as a tap - in , with @entity33 ’s defence appallingly lax			2
@entity59 had replaced the injured @entity58 after five minutes , but that was no excuse			0
the back four had plenty of time to bed in but went to sleep doing so			0
it was a neat build - up involving @entity28 and @entity82 , who slipped the ball to @entity31 overlapping on the right			1
he had too much room and cut the ball back to leave @entity33 flat - footed , @entity28 sneaking between the statues to glance a stooping header past @entity32			1
it was too easy , and it is hard enough to beat @entity2 already — a point @entity75 seemed to be making on the touchline .			1

@entity28 nodded @entity31 ' cross past @entity32 in the 22nd minute to give the @entity7 leaders the upper hand
@entity93 's men extended their *unbeaten* run to seven games
@entity2 maintain their five point lead over @entity364 with 11 games remaining
