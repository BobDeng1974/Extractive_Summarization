a row over money owed from full back @entity3 ’s move from @entity5 to @entity6 in january 2013 has led to @entity7 refusing to deal with football agents @entity9 in future			1
@entity6 consultant @entity11 , effectively in day - to - day control for @entity14 owner @entity13 , has cut any ties with @entity9 following incendiary texts sent to him by their managing director @entity18			1
one text from @entity18 infuriated @entity11 , highly respected former @entity20 compliance chief			1
it read : ‘ pathetic old policeman trying to throw his weight around			1
it does n’t work without the uniform old man			2
i will meet you anywhere any time no problem			0
do n’t ever try to threaten or intimidate me			1
i ’ve seen your waistline			0
sending such immature messages is not acceptable in any form of business			0
’ @entity18 took over as ceo after @entity42 resigned last september			2
he said : ‘ @entity43 was due on a deal			2
@entity6 did n’t want to pay			2
our lawyers dealt with the matter			2
payment was received and we all move on			0
’ @entity49 has eloquent knowledge of boxing , both amateur and professional , which will ensure he is in high demand as a pundit when he hangs up his gloves			1
and his passion for the sport while working for @entity59 on @entity61 boxing contrasts sharply with the tired track and field coverage			1
impressive : @entity49 's work on the @entity59 's boxing coverage in @entity65 has been insightful the @entity59 ’s biggest extravagance at the @entity61 has to be the temporary studio they have built on the @entity69 just 300 yards from @entity59 @entity71 ’s headquarters with its huge broadcasting capacity			1
the @entity59 felt they needed a backdrop of the ‘ @entity77 ’ @entity74 and the @entity76 concert hall , but would n’t reveal the hefty hire fee for this vanity project which includes nine days of construction and another week spent dismantling it from tomorrow night			2
one of the @entity61 winners has been sportswear brand @entity83 , who have greatly raised their profile by supplying kit for @entity87 in a value in kind deal			0
@entity83 pleased athletes by involving them in the design , leading to the third colour of maroon along with red and white on the clothing			0
@entity97 ’s drug denial new zealander @entity97 , chief executive of the @entity98 , said yesterday he had run out of superlatives to describe his own event , including the drug - ridden weightlifting competition among the ‘ great , brilliant , outstanding wonderful competitions			2
’ all this hyperbole before announcing @entity106 @entity105 , 16 , had failed a second drugs test			0
she was later stripped of her weightlifting gold medal			0
how can @entity97 — who is stepping down after @entity65 — praise any sport , let alone weightlifting with its serial drug offenders , whose coaches can corrupt a young athlete to such devastating effect ? stepping down : @entity97 will quit after the @entity61 and praised weightlifting controversially @entity117 2015 have had a team of observers in @entity65 examining what they can learn from the @entity61 , including the transport arrangements			0
these are sure to be a complex business at the @entity123 as well			0
the railway station at @entity125 , which hosts eight games , is a concern judging by complaints about the crush and two - hour queues in the rain after the @entity133 final			0
an @entity135 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are developing a detailed transport plan for each game at the @entity139			0
’ @entity140 , former @entity20 chief executive , is in detailed talks to take a controlling interest in struggling @entity143			1
@entity140 made 190 appearances for the club from 1973 - 80 while also developing his career as a chartered accountant and business turnaround specialist			1
the deal , which is expected to go through , does depend on terms being agreed over the next week with millionaire owner @entity151 , founder of the @entity152 , who has been looking for new investors for almost a decade and has written off £ 5m worth of debt owed to him			0
@entity140 resigned from the @entity20 in august 2004 after revelations about his relationship with @entity158 , who also had an affair with @entity160			1
@entity143 bound ? @entity140 shakes hands with @entity160 during his time at the @entity20			1

man who runs day - to - day operations at @entity6 wo **n't** deal with @entity9 agents
he dealt with company 's managing director @entity18 over @entity3
one text from @entity18 called @entity11 a ' pathetic old policeman ' and said : ' do **n't** ever try to threaten or intimidate me . i *'ve* seen your *waisteline* '
@entity49 's boxing knowledge on @entity59 contrasts with athletics coverage
former @entity20 chief @entity140 could take over at @entity179
