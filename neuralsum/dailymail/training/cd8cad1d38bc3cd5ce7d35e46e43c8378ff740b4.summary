taxpayers ’ handouts to massive ‘ ugly ’ solar farms which scar the countryside are to be axed by environment secretary @entity4			1
she will tell farmers tomorrow to stop pocketing public funds by carpeting large parts of the landscape with the black panels – and go back to growing fruit , vegetables and crops instead			1
the move , to take effect from january , is the latest part of @entity17 ’s attempt to move away from green politics			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ i want @entity19 to lead the world in food and farming and to do that we need enough productive agricultural land			1
‘ i ’m very concerned that a lot of our land is being taken up with solar farms			1
we ’ve already got 250 of them and we ’ve got 10,000 football pitches worth of new solar farms in the pipeline			1
‘ @entity41 and farming is our number one manufacturing industry , the whole food chain represents £ 100 billion in our economy , and it is a real problem if we are using productive agricultural land for solar farms			1
‘ i ’m not against them per se – they ’re fine on commercial roofs and school roofs – but it ’s a big problem if we are using land that can be used to grow crops , fruit and vegetables			1
we import two - thirds of our apples , and using more land for solar panels makes it harder to improve that			2
’ the boom in solar farms in recent years has been fuelled by big grants from @entity65 and @entity66 that have seen landowners pocket up to £ 50,000 a year			1
it has led to claims that they are becoming ‘ the new onshore wind ’ after growing criticism of giant wind turbines			1
ms @entity4 ’s initiative comes amid claims by @entity76 officials that the party is to dump the colour green from its official leaflets			1
a green doodled oak tree logo replaced the @entity76 ’ traditional torch in 2006 , a year after @entity17 became leader , in an attempt to give them an eco-friendly image			1
however , the prime minister ’s enthusiasm for ‘ green power ’ has dimmed with growing scepticism about the speed of climate change and a growing backlash against the appearance and energy efficiency of wind turbines and solar farms			1
mr @entity17 , who once vowed to lead the ‘ greenest government ever ’ , publicly promised to ‘ roll back ’ green taxes , which add more than £ 100 a year to average fuel bills			1
and , to the horror of environmental campaigners , his message in private is said to have been more blunt			0
he reportedly told a colleague : ‘ we ’ve got to get rid of all this green c * * p. ’ the @entity76 mantra of the early days of @entity17 ’s leadership – ‘ vote blue , go green ’ – has rarely been uttered by ministers in recent months			1
the solar power industry costs the taxpayer an estimated £ 600 million a year			1
some of the subsidies are funded by channelling money from household fuel bills , prompting claims that ordinary families are bankrolling wealthy landowners			2
ms @entity4 is to end grants of £ 2 million a year available via her department from the @entity122 ’s @entity121			1
the grants are worth up to £ 100 an acre			2
ministers at the @entity126 announced earlier this year that solar - farm grants from their budget will also be slashed			1
there has been huge growth in large solar projects since 2012			0
two years ago there were just 46 , but the total has soared to about 200 this year , with another 200 awaiting planning permission			0
the @entity135 have already promised not to subsidise any new onshore wind farms if they win next year ’s election with an outright majority			1
she played the role of @entity141 at age of 8 ... and she might just follow her into @entity143 environment secretary @entity4 who played @entity144 in a school election in 1983 it is difficult to top the @entity148 credentials of high - flying cabinet minister @entity4			2
after all , she made her first @entity150 speech as an eight - year - old schoolgirl at @entity152 in @entity153 , in @entity156 ’s @entity155 heartlands			0
‘ i was @entity144 in the school election during the 1983 general election , ’ she says , laughing at her own precociousness			0
as a debating debut , it was not a triumph			0
in the real general election , @entity144 won a landslide victory over the hapless @entity165 , but at @entity166 it was a different story			0
‘ i got no votes – and i did n’t even vote for myself ! ’ why not ? ‘ i was indoctrinated by my parents and did n’t believe in it			0
’ @entity4 ’s mother and father were dyed - in - the - wool @entity173 who took her on @entity176 marches and had her singing @entity178 songs			2
they even helped write her classroom address			0
perhaps that is why her classmates were unconvinced			0
by the time she was a teenager , @entity4 decided her parents were wrong about @entity141			2
‘ i just had this – it ’s hard to analyse it going back … but i always had this fascination with her , ’ she says , as we chat during our interview in her @entity65 office			1
‘ i just thought there was something interesting about what she was doing			0
there was a lot of negativity about @entity19 ’s future , the @entity195 were very pro-europe and anti-american			0
i was fascinated by @entity205 and thought , “ actually , this country does n’t sound that bad ”			0
’ @entity4 ’s appointment as environment secretary in july marked a meteoric rise for the 39 - year - old mother of two			1
after primary school in @entity155 she went to a comprehensive in @entity212 – her accent is more @entity214 than @entity215			0
@entity216 got two , not one maths a-levels			0
an @entity219 degree and career as an oil industry economist followed			0
in 2010 , she finally won an election on a @entity148 platform , becoming mp for @entity226			0
just four years later , she inherited the @entity228 post when @entity229 was sacked by @entity17			2
huntin ’ - shootin ’ - and - fishin ’ @entity76 reactionary @entity229 thought @entity4 , with her @entity232 hues and trendy ‘ @entity234 ’ friends , was better suited to pink designer @entity236 boots worn by yummy - mummies than green ones worn by proper country folk			1
yet anyone who thought she would call off his crusade against eco-warriors may be proved wrong , as she showed by using our interview to announce a crackdown on ugly solar farms			1
i carry out a mini eco audit of ms @entity4			2
‘ we have eco light bulbs and i ’m very frugal , ’ she says , lowering her voice and leaning forward to stress each vowel , evoking another frugal blonde @entity76 who outraged the left by saying she hoarded baked beans in her kitchen cupboard			0
her appointment as environment secretary in july marked a meteoric rise for the 39 - year - old mother of two i do n’t mention her name , @entity144			0
‘ we have lots of roadside stands in @entity226 where you can just pick up vegetables that people have grown in their garden and put the money in a pot. ’ i ’m not sure i want to get her started on turnips ! ( when @entity4 was selected as a parliamentary candidate , the less than progressive squirearchy of @entity226 got into a prurient stew over a brief extramarital fling she had had – prompting headlines about the ‘ @entity278 ’			1
) ‘ turnips are a very tasty option , ’ she chuckles , though it was no laughing matter at the time			0
@entity4 is now happily settled with husband @entity282 and their two daughters , aged eight and five			2
never mind buying vegetables , does townie @entity4 , who constantly tells farmers to grow more fruit and veg , get her manicured fingers dirty and practise what she preaches ? ‘ i keep the water butt full , we ’ve grown tomatoes , runner beans , raspberries , cherries , i ’ve put two gooseberry bushes in and planted two apple trees in the garden			1
’ what about her work - life balance ? did she read her daughters a bedtime story last night ? ‘ i did actually , @entity307 ’s @entity306			0
@entity307 was a moralising early @entity309 writer , politician and devout @entity311 who warned about the threat posed by @entity313			0
‘ remember to hang on to nurse , for fear of finding something worse , ’ says @entity4 , trotting out the best known line			2
doubtless it was a @entity141 favourite too			0
eyeing my frown , @entity4 says : ‘ my daughter loves bloodthirsty stories			2
my other daughter is obsessed with @entity324 and made croissants for breakfast			0
’ @entity4 ’s friend and @entity329 ally @entity327 is fond of saying she will be the @entity135 ’ second female leader			2
‘ i just want to get things done			0
@entity17 is going to be the prime minister for a long time			2
’ and after that ? ‘ i ’m just enjoying doing what i ’m doing , @entity338 , ’ she says with a smile .			0

handouts to fund massive solar farms are to be axed by @entity4
move is part of @entity17 *'s* attempt to move away from green politics
she will tell farmers to go back to growing fruit , vegetables and crops
