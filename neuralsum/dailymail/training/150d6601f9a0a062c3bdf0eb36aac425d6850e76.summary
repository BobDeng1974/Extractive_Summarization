the delay in @entity1 signing a new contract with @entity3 coincides with big changes at @entity5 , who represent the @entity8 star			1
agent @entity9 is in the process of leaving impact to set up his own business and is taking @entity13 and @entity15 striker @entity14 with him			1
another @entity8 international , @entity16 of @entity17 , may follow			2
there has been speculation for some time that @entity9 , who works closely with that trio , would break away from the @entity23 - run operation			1
@entity9 ’s new company will also have athletics and boxing clients			1
rising @entity28 heavyweight hope @entity29 , an @entity30 gold medallist , was linked with @entity9 before he turned professional			1
@entity1 's @entity3 contract talks have been delayed due to his agent @entity9 there will be short - term complications in any new deal involving @entity1 or @entity14 because of their current representation contracts with @entity11 , who look after nearly 200 players			1
but @entity23 said : ‘ everything is being worked out between myself and @entity9 in a very amicable fashion , despite some in our industry suggesting otherwise			1
@entity9 wants to go it alone and i can understand the reasons but we will continue to work together when it suits us			1
’ @entity15 striker @entity14 ( right ) is another player who shares the same agent as @entity1 with most of the negativity about @entity51 hosting the @entity52 coming from the powerful @entity28 press , the organising committee hope a @entity28 candidate emerges from the global recruitment search for their @entity52 communications director to be based in @entity57			1
@entity58 look to be playing a highly tactical game over the @entity61 presidential election since @entity62 declared he was not going to challenge @entity63			2
but instead of supporting another candidate , @entity58 are happy both @entity66 @entity65 and prince @entity67 are standing as they want as much @entity69 noise as possible over the next four months			2
meanwhile it is likely that @entity63 ’s stooge candidate @entity71 will get the five nominations he needs to contest the race because the @entity74 will want one friendly rival in the mix whom he can control			0
the @entity78 are expected to support prince @entity67 even with @entity80 deciding to stand and @entity82 ’s @entity81 another possibility			0
candidate @entity84 ( left ) hopes to challenge @entity63 ( right ) in the @entity61 presidential race @entity87 2012 ’s organising committee gained the name ‘ @entity89 ’ because of their frequent refusal to be linked to parallel events owing to the restrictions on using the @entity30 brand			0
so the legion of @entity96 alumni now working for @entity8 rugby 2015 have tried to be more accommodating for the @entity98 by setting up a separate @entity99 with its own logo and branding			0
@entity103 deadline revamp @entity104 are making much - needed changes to their transfer deadline day coverage after the fiasco of the last window			0
two reporters had to seek sanctuary inside grounds from fans ’ protests , while sex aids were brandished by mischievous supporters in front of the cameras at two other chaotic venues			0
this time around @entity104 , who go ludicrously over the top at the end of the transfer window , intend to make next monday more of a studio - based day			0
this will involve many of their leading pundits analysing the day ’s events , plus more news of deals across @entity129			0
@entity103 are asking clubs to allow their reporters to deliver their frequent updates from inside the grounds so any demos or exhibitionist behaviour can be avoided			0
however , @entity103 will not say how many @entity137 outfits have agreed to let them in			0
meanwhile , with @entity103 believing they invented deadline day tv coverage , @entity140 are sure to antagonise them with their ‘ mellow yellow ’ promo featuring @entity143 that lampoons @entity103 ’s colour motif on the day			0
however , after stirring things up , @entity140 need to prove themselves by breaking some transfer news			0
a blow - up doll put in an appearance as the clock ticked towards the transfer deadline last september @entity153 had his broadcast interrupted by a fan with a sex toy at @entity157 last year @entity159 's arrival at @entity160 as their lead football presenter next month is timely			1
@entity160 are in the process of gaining @entity52 cricket highlights for terrestrial showing , and @entity159 has hosted @entity160 ’s @entity166 cricket coverage			2
however the @entity52 action is likely to come as a self - contained package and will not be presenter led			1
@entity160 , who signed @entity159 as lead football presenter , are likely to gain @entity52 cricket highlights			2

@entity1 's agent @entity9 is leaving @entity5
@entity9 will start his own business taking @entity13 and @entity14 too
@entity178 highlights are likely to not be presenter led
