demands by the taxman for the power to raid @entity3 were met with a wave of opposition last night			1
@entity6 wants unprecedented power to settle unpaid tax bills			1
it has already been revealed that this includes taking money directly from current accounts – including joint accounts			1
but the controversial proposals would also make it possible for money to be seized from your tax - free @entity3 whether it is held in cash or stocks and shares			1
the move has been widely criticised by mps and accountants who fear @entity6 , which has a track record of incompetence , will target the wrong people by mistake			1
controversial proposals would make it possible for money to be seized from your tax - free @entity3 by @entity6 ( library image ) one think - tank , the @entity33 , said the proposals represent ‘ a fundamental assault on the rule of law ’ and many of the victims will be ‘ completely innocent ’			1
anyone who owes £ 1,000 or more in tax could be affected – and @entity6 will not even need to get a judge ’s approval to withdraw the cash			1
the proposals were published in the @entity45 in march and are subject to a public consultation which ends on july 29			0
@entity6 expects to seize around £ 375million over the next four years under the @entity48 powers , due to come into force next year			1
it predicts around 17,000 people a year will have money taken , the majority self - employed			2
@entity53 , national tax partner at accountancy and investment firm @entity57 , said the proposals ‘ provide inadequate assurance for honest taxpayers ’ who risked being hit by @entity6 errors			1
@entity6 insists it will not take the money unless the person will be left with at least £ 5,000 across all their bank accounts and @entity3 after the tax debt has been paid			1
by including @entity3 , @entity6 ’s chances of withdrawing money are significantly increased as they are hugely popular			1
around 23million people have a total of £ 442billion saved in them			0
miss @entity53 said people must be properly compensated if a mistake is made as a result of the taxman ’s new powers			1
‘ i do not mean that they just get their money back with a bit of interest on top , ’ she said			0
‘ they must be compensated so that their isas are put back in the position that they would have been in if @entity6 had not made a mistake			2
’ @entity6 expects to seize around £ 375million over the next four years under the @entity48 powers , due to come into force next year ( library image ) this is because they could miss out on huge rises in share values if the money in their @entity94 is seized			1
@entity96 , a tax partner at accountants @entity98 , said : ‘ it is absolutely right that people should pay tax that is due			2
‘ but in our view , any benefits from these proposals are far outweighed by the potentially extremely serious consequences for individuals and businesses if errors are made			0
’ @entity110 , head of the tax faculty at the @entity112 , said there is considerable concern from both taxpayers and accountants about the proposals			2
‘ such powers are unprecedented in the @entity119 and could be open to mistakes and misuse , ’ he said			2
‘ fundamentally , we believe that money should only be taken from someone ’s bank account by agreement or under the supervision of a court			0
’ a major concern surrounds joint accounts			0
for example , a woman might pay all the money into it and be unaware that her husband owes money to the taxman			0
last week , exchequer secretary to the treasury @entity137 said : ' it will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe , when they owe it and those who do not ' miss @entity53 said : ‘ there are many reasons why an account may be in joint names			0
for example , an elderly parent may have added a son or daughter to their account			0
‘ is it fair that the parent ’s bank balance could be reduced because the son or daughter has not paid tax ? ’ typically , the people targeted will owe an average of £ 5,800			0
in the consultation document , published last week , exchequer secretary to the treasury @entity137 said : ‘ it will help to level the playing field between those who pay what they owe , when they owe it and those who do not			0
’ he said the rules will only target ‘ the truly non-compliant ’ , who he described as ‘ a small core of taxpayers who owe significant debts of over £ 1,000 and have sufficient funds in their accounts to pay ’			0
a @entity180 report warned last week : ‘ this policy is highly dependent on @entity6 ’s ability accurately to determine which taxpayers owe money and what amounts they owe ... an ability not always demonstrated in the past			2
’ @entity6 insists it will only seize the money if it has made every effort to contact the taxpayer about the debt			2
its consultation document says it will typically have contacted a taxpayer who has ‘ a good history of compliance ’ nine times by letter and telephone concerning the debt			0
the minimum is four times			0
around half of those who will be affected have more than £ 20,000 in their bank and building society accounts and @entity3			2
cheats who fail to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them cost @entity119 around £ 35billion a year , according to @entity6			0
an @entity6 spokesman said last night : " where an error by @entity6 results in funds being mistakenly transferred out of an isa we will ensure that funds are replaced and that the account holder does not lose any of their tax free limit for the year			1
