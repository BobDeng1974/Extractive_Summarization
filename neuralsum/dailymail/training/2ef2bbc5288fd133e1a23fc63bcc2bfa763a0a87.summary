@entity0 is just around the corner and i ’m mega excited to get dressed up ! fancy dress always makes getting ready for a night out more fun , and on @entity0 you can really go crazy with your costumes			1
i ’ve decided on a scary yet sexy look this year , inspired by @entity8 in the film @entity10			1
it features dramatic winged eyes and a deep vampy berry lip , and offers maximum impact with not too much effort ! @entity16 was inspired by @entity8 in the movie @entity10 for her @entity0 look so in case you ’re deliberating over your october 31 ensemble , this week i thought i ’d share with you how to get the look yourselves			1
the base to create a spooky white base for the look , mix white face paint with a dollop of a light coverage foundation like @entity29 to make the look slightly less harsh			1
@entity16 has used make - up rather than face paint in order to avoid looking too harsh apply the mixture all over the face with a foundation brush or sponge like @entity38 , and fix in place with a generous sweep of @entity41			1
next , contour your cheekbones with a strong dark colour for a dramatic sculpted look – i used @entity46 in @entity47 , brushing the colour heavily just under my cheekbones to create the illusion of a super-structured visage			0
the eyes start by using a liquid eyeliner with a precise nib like @entity54 to create the outline of the haunting dark eyes			0
begin from the temple and take the line all around your eyes , ending with a point towards your nose			0
feel free to make the outline as big and bold as you like – if you ca n’t go all out on @entity0 , when can you ? @entity16 says that @entity0 is the one opportunity to go as bold as you like with makeup once you ’ve successfully outlined the shape , use the @entity54 eyeliner to add further lines and patterns into the eye socket to create the swan - wing effect			1
to fill the eyes in use a highly pigmented black shadow like the dark shade in the @entity78 5 @entity77 in @entity79			0
to embellish the eyes further , fill in some sections with the deep navy and green shades from the palette			0
follow up with lashings of @entity86 to give your peepers a sexily spooky flutter			0
the lips finally , for a vampy @entity8 - style pout , apply a deep berry or maroon coloured lippy			2
i ’ve gone for the @entity94 in @entity95 , which is super moisturising on the lips and stays put for hours			0
@entity16 has gone all out this october and has even tried out some spooky nail art and there you have it – a ghoulish yet glam @entity0 look that you do n’t have to be an artist to create			1
you can get all the products i used from online beauty boutique @entity105			0
if you ’re not big on fancy dress but still want to inject a little bit of @entity0 spooky spirit to your beauty routine on october 31 , why not try out some nail art ? i ’ve been experimenting with fun @entity0 nail looks using my @entity114 nail polishes			2
enjoy your @entity0 celebrations , whatever you choose to dress up as ! lots of love , @entity119 xxx			2
