@entity0 was accused of betraying small firms last night after sacking hundreds of business advisers – and leaving employers to get lending advice by phone			1
the taxpayer - backed bank will axe half of its travelling small business relationship managers , hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country			1
from may , minnow companies and start - up firms will be left relying on phone banking or the internet to get in touch with the lender			1
betrayal : taxpayer - backed @entity0 , heavily bailed out by government after the credit crunch , will axe half of its small business relationship managers , hitting up to 120,000 firms in every part of the country @entity0 is already one of the worst culprits for choking off lending to small firms , despite taking part in a @entity28 scheme designed to boost loans			1
since june 2012 its cumulative net lending – the difference between the total amount of money handed out minus the total amount paid back by its customers – is minus £ 2.2billion , according to the @entity36			0
critics said the latest move was further evidence that the lender had turned its back on the country ’s smallest enterprises			1
@entity44 , of the @entity45 , said : ‘ small firms have lost trust in their bank and much more needs to be done to repair the damage			1
‘ thirty per cent of our members keep in touch with their bank through face - to - face meetings			2
‘ it is difficult to understand why @entity0 will only offer their smallest business customers help and advice by phone if their goal is to rebuilding trust and re-establish personal relations with those firms			1
’ @entity63 , former @entity64 spokesman , said : ‘ that ’s a giant step in the wrong direction by @entity0			2
the smallest businesses need local bankers , not box - tickers , to understand their needs			2
the more of a bank we taxpayers own , the less they lend			0
’ centralised : from may , minnow companies and start - up firms will be left relying on phone banking with call centre operatives like these or the internet to get in touch with the lender			2
( @entity83 image ) the bank employs more than 1,000 small and medium - sized enterprise relationship managers			1
but 560 of these will lose their jobs amid another round of redundancies costing 1,080 staff at the group , which is in the process of shedding 15,000 staff over several years			0
another 300 staff will see their roles outsourced			0
of the 250,000 small and mid-sized firms on its books , the smallest 120,000 will no longer be able to get meetings with travelling relationship managers			0
they will still have access to branch staff ‘ when they start up ’ , although the bank said its ‘ specialist business managers ’ will be based in a central office			0
@entity0 defended the move , saying that smaller companies had ‘ less complex needs ’ than larger firms			1
a spokesman said ‘ this will help us cater more effectively for the needs of our clients – including many smaller firms that want to make more use of the telephone and internet to manage their day - to - day banking and the increasing number of start - ups we are helping to support			0
’ he added : ‘ all of our clients will continue to have the support of specialist business managers and for our smallest clients , in addition to branch staff , managers based in our central teams			0
to underpin this reorganisation , we are investing in improved technology and services			0
‘ we want to ensure all our clients get the right level of support , whatever their size , sector , or location – and how ever they bank with us			0
