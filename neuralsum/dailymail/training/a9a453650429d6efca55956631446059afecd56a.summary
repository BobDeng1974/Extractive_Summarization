for those of a certain age with longer memories , it does n’t seem like yesterday that @entity5 captains were suffering shoulder pain from lifting so much silverware and dropping @entity8 on his head			1
@entity10 wo n’t thank us for reminding him on the eve of saturday ’s @entity14 final against @entity15 , but it is now nine years since the @entity17 won a trophy , beating @entity19 at the @entity20 after a penalty shootout			1
@entity22 and @entity23 had just been re-elected for a third term in power , and @entity27 by @entity28 ( no pun intended , @entity10 ) was about to begin a four - week stay at the top of the @entity32 charts			0
here are a few other changes in the world since the @entity47 won the last of his 11 trophies at the club ... his old rival sir @entity50 has retired but not before adding another five @entity40 titles , one @entity53 crown , a @entity54 , three @entity55 and four @entity56 since that @entity58 defeat to the @entity17			1
@entity59 has been invented , although it ’s unlikely you would need more than 140 characters to list @entity5 achievements			2
star : @entity65 has won the @entity66 four times since @entity5 have lifted a trophy end of an era : former @entity19 boss sir @entity50 retired after 26 years in charge @entity71 have been relegated or promoted five times – not to mention beating @entity5 in the 2011 @entity73 ( @entity15 take note )			1
@entity75 has had 14 births , 24 weddings and 45 deaths – and yet dot battles on – while @entity80 ’ wives and @entity81 have come to an end			0
nine different managers have been in charge of @entity86 , including @entity88 ’s two stints at @entity89			0
iconic : @entity90 ( left ) became the first black @entity92 president and @entity93 is still in @entity75 back again : @entity88 has found time to leave and return to @entity86 since @entity5 last won anything pope @entity97 ’s 26 - year term in office came to an end following his death in april 2005 , and we have since had two more – pope @entity102 and @entity103			1
@entity65 has been awarded the @entity66 on no fewer than four occasions , not to mention winning the @entity53 three times , six @entity107 titles , two @entity108 , two @entity109 , two @entity110 , and an @entity111			0
some of @entity113 ’s biggest icecaps are said to have melted by up to 5.2 per cent			0
up and down : @entity71 have been relegated or promoted five times changing places : @entity5 moved home and left @entity117 for the @entity43 ( pictured ) in 2006 @entity118 has been married and separated three times – splitting from @entity120 , @entity121 and now @entity122			1
the world has stood on the brink of economic disaster			0
@entity126 won the vote , built the stadiums and then hosted a rather successful @entity129			0
@entity130 : @entity131 kisses the @entity133 turf as he scores the last goal at the stadium in 2006 @entity136 : @entity118 has been married and separated three times since @entity5 's last trophy the @entity138 is into its sixth generation after first coming on the market in 2007			1
@entity141 has 32 professional fights under his belt , but the 27 - year - old was still boxing in the amateurs when @entity5 last won a trophy			2
since @entity148 quit as dr who in june 2005 , there have been three new doctors – @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			0
old : @entity141 ( right ) was an amateur when @entity5 last won a trophy - he 's now had 32 professional fights			2

@entity5 have n't won a trophy since their @entity14 victory in 2005
@entity86 have had nine different managers in that time
sir @entity50 has finally retired as @entity19 manager
@entity5 have moved from @entity117 to the @entity43
@entity59 was launched and @entity166 released the @entity138
@entity90 became the first black president of the @entity92
