@entity0 ended 2014 with a refereeing call that had @entity2 crying conspiracy and has started the new year on the receiving end of an almighty attack from @entity6			0
@entity8 ’s manager was so angry with two decisions here that he went as far as to suggest the official should serve a suspension , having already claimed he is ‘ losing faith ’ in referees as a collective			0
it was powerful stuff from a man who frequently in his press briefing said : ‘ i am limited in what i can say			0
’ not that such gripes from @entity21 are anything new , even if he has often been in the right			0
indeed , @entity8 do seem to have been on the wrong end of a hefty number of decisions , particularly the type that matter , like red cards			2

subs not used : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 booked : @entity88 sent off goals : @entity87 manager : @entity6 6.5 referee : @entity0 4 attendance : 17,729 @entity100 : @entity45 click here for our brilliant @entity103 service for all the stats and graphics from the match at @entity36 @entity46 keeper @entity37 appeared to handle the ball outside the area after intercepting a @entity88 attack there were two such incidents in this game and @entity21 thinks @entity0 got both of them wrong			1
he was incredulous that @entity37 could stay on the pitch after six minutes when he handled outside the box to stop @entity88			1
and he was furious that @entity0 then sent off @entity88 four minutes from full - time for kicking out at @entity51			1
for good measure , he also accused @entity51 of being ‘ reckless ’ in performing the ‘ leg - breaker ’ of a tackle that drove @entity88 to retaliate			1
among it all , it was almost possible to forget that @entity32 came off the bench to score a stoppage - time leveller after @entity45 ’s stunning opener after 20 minutes			1
for @entity21 , though , the sense of frustration is getting unbearable , having already seen @entity130 handed a retrospective four - game ban this week			0
this kick out on @entity51 from @entity88 earned the @entity8 forward a straight red card in the second - half at @entity36 former @entity46 winger @entity88 ( right ) reacts after @entity51 's late challenge and was sent off by referee @entity0 @entity88 was sent off late in the second - half for violent conduct after reacting to @entity51 's poorly timed tackle both sets of players get involved following @entity88 's dismissal late in the draw at @entity36 as @entity64 confronts the winger he said : ‘ i am losing a bit of faith and so are my players when we continuously have decisions like this			1
‘ i just hope that @entity88 ’s card gets rescinded			1
he goes from nearly having a leg broken to being sent off			0
he ( @entity88 ) nudges him ( @entity51 ) away			1
‘ with the other one ( @entity37 ’s handball ) it is a half metre outside the box			1
the linesman has a clear view			0
not sure how you miss that			0
we have a lot of people missing things			0
i am tired of talking about it			0
‘ i have been involved 20 years in professional football			2
i understand you get bad decisions but we seem to get a succession of bad ones			0
' i have asked the referee to help rescind it ( @entity88 ’s red card ) which will be the right thing for us and football			1
’ asked if officials should serve a suspension for game - changing errors , @entity6 added : ‘ i lose a player and i have to suffer so officials should suffer as well			0
’ while his claims about @entity88 ’s red card are more dubious , there was no doubting @entity37 was lucky to stay on for the first infringement after six minutes			1
@entity88 had gone clean through after a flick from @entity86 and went to round @entity37			1
the goalkeeper was outside his area and handled ; the referee who wrongly booked @entity192 ’s @entity191 for diving against @entity194 on sunday guaranteed himself more flak			2
@entity46 boss @entity57 gives out the instructions to his players on thursday during the league clash with @entity8 at @entity36 @entity63 attempts to start another @entity46 attack on thursday as the home side looked for another @entity36 win @entity86 of @entity8 grapples for possession with @entity46 's @entity61 during the clash in @entity204 @entity84 fails to hold off the challenge of @entity46 defender @entity62 on @entity44 during the tense match in @entity204 ‘ i did not see it , ’ said @entity57			1
the @entity46 manager is contending a strange old season			1
utterly incompetent on the road , where they have lost all their matches , their form at @entity36 has been the saving grace			2
they led here after 20 minutes through a sublime finish from @entity45 and @entity49 then blew a chance to double the lead			1
what followed should , perhaps , have caused @entity21 as much anxiety as the refereeing			0
certainly , his words about @entity0 should not disguise the profligacy of his attackers on a day when they had 24 shots and only scored with the last			0
@entity228 ( right ) was the man of the @entity229 at @entity36 , narrowly missing out on guiding @entity46 to another win @entity32 , surprisingly , was left on the bench , even though @entity6 later insisted it was nothing to do with speculation that the striker is a target for @entity236			1
in his place , @entity89 proved more mobile but not nearly as effective in front of goal			0
he missed all manner of chances			0
for a while the misses appeared decisive			2
@entity46 had missed plenty of their own , but with only 40 per cent of the possession were clinging on			2
their chances improved when @entity88 saw red but then a @entity87 sucker punch			2
@entity57 said : ‘ it ’s a big blow			2
it happened here with @entity249 in the last second when we should have drawn			0
‘ these were two vital points that we deserved and needed but could n’t hang on			2
’ a new year and the same old gripes			0
@entity76 fist bumps @entity46 striker @entity256 after his opener at @entity36 looked set to seal the three point for the home side @entity46 captain @entity64 attempts to shield the ball from @entity8 striker @entity32 , who scored a late equaliser at @entity36 @entity8 keeper @entity78 leaps into the air in celebration as the away side managed to find a late equaliser at @entity46 @entity46 's in form striker @entity256 is denied a late winner as @entity8 keeper @entity78 managed to deflect his shot wide the @entity8 players applaud the travelling fans having secured a 1 - 1 draw at @entity46 thanks to @entity87 's ( centre ) last minute strike			1

@entity48 midfielder @entity45 put @entity46 ahead with shot from outside the box after 20 minutes
@entity282 striker @entity32 comes off the bench to score a late equaliser to secure a point for the away side
@entity46 keeper @entity37 appeared to handle the ball outside the area early on but went *unpunished*
@entity88 received a straight red card for kicking out at @entity46 midfielder @entity51
all of @entity46 's league points this season have come at home at @entity36 as @entity57 's side drop to 16th
