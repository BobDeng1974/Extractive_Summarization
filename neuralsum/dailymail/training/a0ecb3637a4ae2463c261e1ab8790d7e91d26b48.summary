morally wrong : @entity0 mp said it is wrong that so many people get welfare payments ' for life ' only 6 per cent of new disability benefit claimants have a face - to - face assessment with a medic , it has been revealed			1
disability minister @entity0 said it is morally wrong that so many people get welfare payments ‘ for life ’ based on a form they often fill in themselves			1
mr @entity0 , appointed to @entity16 ’s department last week , claimed @entity17 tried to ‘ control unemployment ’ by putting people on disability benefits			1
this month , the government will start to reassess disability living allowance ( @entity24 ) claimants for a new benefit called personal independence payment , which includes an assessment and regular reviews			1
the plans have been attacked by medical charities and disability groups , who say they cause uncertainty for claimants			2
but ministers say without reform , by 2018 one in 17 people would be claiming a benefit designed for those unable to walk			2
the number on @entity24 was set to rise to 3.6million by 2015 , up from 1.1million when it was created in 1992			0
there are currently 3.3million claimants , costing more than £ 13billion a year – close to the @entity44 ’s total budget			2
government statistics show that in the 12 months to march , just 6 per cent of new @entity24 claimants had a face - to - face assessment with a healthcare professional , with 94 per cent receiving it on the basis of a claim form , sometimes with evidence such as a gp ’s note			1
that equates to some £ 250million a year given to new claimants with no face - to - face medical checks			1
the figures also show 55 per cent of decisions are made on a claim form alone , without any additional corroborating medical evidence			0
mr @entity0 said : ‘ we ca n’t just leave people and say “ you ’ve filled a form in , sent it off and that means you ’re on the benefit for life ”			1
‘ it ’s not fair on them and it ’s not fair on the taxpayer – or those people with disabilities who need more help			0
’ he said it was absurd not to have regular check - ups , since only 3 per cent of people with disabilities are born with them and many conditions change over time			1
dancing drag queen who said he could not walk ‘ under the personal independence payment , claimants will have a face - to - face assessment and systematic reviews – something missing in the current system – to make sure they ’re getting the right levels of support			1
this is about making the benefit sustainable , ’ he added			0
mr @entity0 said around 170,000 people are likely to lose disability benefit by the next election , but up to 150,000 of the most severely disabled will get more support			1
‘ we expect to find a large number of people who have been incorrectly assessed , ’ he said			0
though @entity24 can be claimed by those in work , the minister said he believed people had been shoved on to a range of sickness and disability benefits to stop them claiming unemployment handouts			1
‘ in my view this was the way @entity17 was trying to control unemployment , ’ he said			0
‘ that might keep the unemployment statistics down but it also writes people off			0
’ the new assessment , initially only given to first - time claimants , looks at everyday activities such as washing , cooking and getting around			2
it also examines reading , verbal communication and how someone engages with other people , one reason why ministers claim it will do a better job of recognising certain mental health conditions			0
under @entity24 , 71 per cent of claimants get indefinite awards , without systematic reassessments			2
but those on personal independence payment will face regular checks			0
the @entity24 system overpays some claimants £ 630million every year , while others are underpaid by £ 190million , figures show			0
paralympian @entity140 has led criticism of the changes , arguing they will hit the vulnerable			0
she said many disabled people – such as those who are paralysed or are amputees – are ‘ not suddenly going to get better ’ .			0

only 6 per cent of new claimants have face - to - face assessment
