by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:56 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 25 june 2013 a woman gave a stranger 's baby a feeding bottle filled with bleach in a branch of @entity8 's , a jury ruled today			1
@entity10 , 53 , has been charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life , and jurors at @entity15 today declared that she had fed bleach to the child			1
the 11 - month - old boy drank some of the liquid after @entity10 handed it to him , then vomited from the poisonous effects of the bleach			1
judge @entity22 had previously ruled that @entity10 was unfit to plead , and a trial to decide the question of what happened in the @entity27 branch of the fast - food restaurant therefore took place in her absence			1
scene : the 11 - month - old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of @entity35 ( pictured ) in @entity27 , south - east @entity36 , @entity15 was told a jury of five men and seven women took just half an hour to decide that it was @entity10 who gave the child bleach , and that it had not been a case of mistaken identity			1
the jury had been told by the judge that the main issue in the trial concerned the identification of the poisoner as being @entity10			1
police had compiled @entity52 evidence which showed a woman carrying a baby 's bottle , walking along the @entity56 in @entity27 , and entering @entity8 's , where she is seen to pass the bottle towards the boy			1
' the prosecution say that this woman is the defendant , ' the judge said			2
' there is no witness present at @entity35 who has identified the defendant			0
however police circulated a still image showing the woman in the entrance of @entity8 's			2
' that was seen by police constable @entity71 who recognised the woman in the image as the defendant , who she had seen in july 2011			0
' the judge said the jury could also consider that clothing similar to that worn by the woman in the @entity52 had been found at the defendant 's address , and also that @entity10 's partner @entity82 , 68 , had said she told him she had been to @entity27 that day			1
home : @entity10 , 53 , of @entity84 , @entity85 , south - east @entity36 , is charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life			1
the road on which she lives is pictured he earlier told the jury : ‘ in this case the defendant has been found by me to be unfit to stand her trial			1
‘ i have decided on the evidence of two specialist medical practitioners , one instructed by the defence , one by the prosecution , that she is mentally ill , such that she can not understand the proceedings , can not understand the evidence , and can not give valid instructions to her legal team			2
’ it was appropriate that she did not attend , he added			0
in such circumstances , there was not a finding of guilty or not guilty , but the jury should instead decide whether or not she did the act she was alleged to have done			1
' some random person had given my baby a bottle , which he had drunk from and was vomiting			0
as far as i was concerned , my baby had been poisoned ' mother of baby @entity119 , prosecuting , told the jury yesterday that the incident took place last september at the @entity8 ’s branch			2
he said : ‘ @entity10 , say the prosecution , gave to a complete stranger ’s baby a feeding bottle that contained a poisonous or noxious substance , a fluid that contained bleach , or something very similar			1
‘ the baby , who was 11 and a half months old , took some of that fluid in his mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it			2
he retched and vomited over himself and turned very pale			0
’ his grandmother seized it from the pram to prevent further harm , mr @entity119 said			0
the baby - who can not be identified for legal reasons - made a good recovery with no long - term ill effects , he added			2
‘ ingestion of bleach can prove fatal , and in the case of such a young child is particularly hazardous			1
’ a statement from the child ’s grandmother was read , in which said she was looking after the baby in @entity8 ’s while his mother was at the counter and she saw him retching and dribbling			0
‘ i reached for a bottle that was in his pram			0
as i looked into it i noticed it was orange in colour with white milk particles in it			0
it was extremely frothy on the top			0
‘ i realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him			0
three black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle			0
’ the mother said in a statement : ‘ some random person had given my baby a bottle , which he had drunk from and was vomiting			0
as far as i was concerned , my baby had been poisoned			0
’ trainee detective constable @entity71 - formerly a uniformed police constable - told the court she had identified @entity10 from a @entity52 photograph from that day last september as someone she had dealings with in 2011			1
she said she spent an hour with her in july that year , including 15 minutes sitting next to her in a car			2
asked by @entity185 , defending , if she was sure that the person she had seen in the @entity52 image was the same woman she had dealings with in 2011 , she said : ‘ i am absolutely certain that is the same person			0
’ the hearing has been adjourned until july , when @entity10 will attend court to discover how her case will be dealt with			1
