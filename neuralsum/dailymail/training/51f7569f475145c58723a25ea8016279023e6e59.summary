sir @entity1 's claim that he brought flop @entity3 to @entity4 on the recommendation of @entity6 is false , insists his former assistant manager			1
@entity1 signed the forward in a £ 7.4million deal in august 2010 from @entity10 , a price tag considered exorbitant by many given his career to that point included a single season in @entity17 's fourth tier			1
@entity1 has said @entity3 was the first player he had brought to @entity18 who he had n't seen in action personally , crediting @entity6 for convincing him to make the signing			1
' he did n't exist in a system where nothing escaped us			0
' so @entity3 going to @entity4 took me by surprise			2
' i called my coaches and asked them what was going on , why he did n't exist			0
' the transfer has been subject of a corruption investigation by @entity17 police into why the @entity51 giants would pay so much for a lower league player			1
@entity3 is widely regarded among the most disappointing signings of @entity1 's illustrous 26 - year reign at @entity4			2
@entity3 played jut twice in the league for the @entity56 before moving to @entity17 's @entity33 in the summer in a £ 2m deal			1
before that he 'd spent time on loan with @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity23			0
@entity3 came to @entity4 having not even appeared for @entity62 - the winger , soon after signing with agent @entity63 , was picked up by @entity4 just weeks after a free transfer from @entity65 after the third division club did n't pay his wages			2
@entity63 is noted for taking @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 to @entity4 , and reportedly earned £ 2.89m in the @entity3 deal			2
for @entity1 ( left ) , the £ 7.4m signing of @entity3 ( right ) is among his least successful transfers at @entity4 @entity3 tracks @entity74 on his return to @entity76 with @entity33 for the @entity77 at @entity78 this summer although a player @entity4 fans - and @entity1 - would prefer to forget , @entity3 has impressed at @entity33 with his manager @entity81 saying last month that he could make a stunning return to @entity76 ad even the @entity51			1

' @entity85 's development will be equal to @entity90 's , @entity91 's and @entity92			0
they were all late bloomers			0

@entity6 insisted he had no input in the £ 7.4m signing of @entity3
sir @entity1 claimed his former assistant advised on the purchase
@entity3 had played one season in @entity17 's third division before the move
he did n't start a @entity51 match and made two league *appearances*
