by @entity0 correspondent published : 07:09 est , 19 august 2013 @entity2 : 02:23 est , 20 august 2013 happy father : the @entity4 during his first interview since the birth of @entity7 , for a documentary to be screened next month prince @entity9 has revealed how the birth of his ‘ little rascal ’ son has changed his life			1
in a candid interview , his first since becoming a father , he admitted the days following @entity7 ’s arrival had been ‘ emotional ’ , and affected him more than he thought possible			1
but the prince could not resist joking about the sleepless nights and endless dirty nappies of fatherhood – and how his newborn son reminded him of his younger brother , prince @entity22			1
asked about what legacy he would like to leave @entity7 , he quipped : ‘ at the moment , the only legacy i want to pass on to him is to sleep more and maybe not have to change his nappy so many times			1
’ @entity9 gave the interview , his first since @entity7 ’s birth on july 22 , to @entity32 ’s royal correspondent @entity31 as part of a documentary about his determination to preserve wildlife in @entity37			1
prince @entity9 ’s @entity38 : @entity39 , new father airs on the @entity42 channel on september 15 , but excerpts of the interview have been released today			1
he was interviewed in the gardens of @entity46 on august 2 , when his son was 11 days old			1
on being a new father , @entity9 said : ‘ i think the last few weeks for me have been just a very different emotional experience			1
something i never thought i would feel myself			0
' and i find , again it ’s only been a short period , but a lot of things affect me differently now			0
he recalled the ‘ daunting ’ moment he introduced @entity7 to the world on the steps of the @entity59 at @entity60 in @entity61 , and made clear his determination to give his son as normal a life as possible			1
‘ as any new parent knows , you ’re only too happy to show off your new child and , you know , proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything			1
’ but asked whether he was comfortable with the experience , @entity9 admitted : ‘ again it ’s not somewhere i enjoy being , [ but ] i know that the position i ’m in ... that ’s what ’s required of me to do			1
‘ it ’s nice that people want to see @entity7 , so , you know – i ’m just glad he was n’t screaming his head off the whole way through			2
’ the prince revealed that his decision to take the wheel as they drove away from hospital was intended as a public demonstration of his determination to do things his way			1
magic moment : a month ago the @entity4 and @entity109 left the @entity59 of @entity60 in @entity110 , and the world got to see their newborn son and future king off home : @entity7 cried lustily , like his father when he was born , as he was taken back to @entity46 by his parents after being born on july 22 as @entity9 hoisted @entity7 ’s car seat into his @entity119 in front of the world ’s media last month , every parent watching held their breath			1
and when he did it perfectly , they knew his secret : practice			0
@entity9 admitted : ‘ i was terrified that … it was going to fall off or it was n’t going to close properly			2
so , i had actually practised with that seat – but only once			0
’ he said : ‘ where i can be i am as independent as i want to be , the same as @entity82 and @entity22			1
we ’ve all grown up differently to other generations			0
and i very much feel if i can do it myself , i want to do it myself			0
‘ and there are times where you ca n’t do it yourself and the system takes over or it ’s appropriate to do things differently			2
‘ but , i think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really important to me			2
and i do n’t like fuss , so it ’s much easier to just do it yourself			0
’ asked by mr @entity31 if he was sending a message to the world , he replied : ‘ i think so			2
i ’m just doing it the way i know … if it ’s the right way then brilliant , if it ’s not – if it ’s the wrong way – then i ’ll try to do it better			0
‘ but i ’m reasonably headstrong about what i believe in , and what i go for , and i ’ve got fantastic people around me who give me great support and advice			0
’ and he joked : ‘ and i did n’t stall ! it ’s an automatic , so it ’s alright			2
’ asked about baby @entity7 ’s character , @entity9 said affectionately : ‘ well , yeah – he ’s a little bit of a rascal , put it that way			1
‘ so he either reminds me of my brother or me when i was younger			2
‘ but he ’s doing very well at the moment			2
he does like to keep having his nappy changed			2
’ and @entity9 confirmed that he changed his son ’s first nappy while still at hospital , describing it as a nerve - wracking experience			1
sit down : @entity32 correspondent @entity31 ( back to camera ) interviewing prince @entity9 in the gardens of his @entity110 home doting dad : @entity9 described his son 's birth and first month as ' emotional ' and described @entity7 as a rascal who needs to sleep more prince @entity9 has said that he plans to start introducing @entity37 and its endangered species to @entity7 in his nursery at @entity46 at an early age			1
using toys and colourful interior design the @entity4 and @entity109 want to ' make him grow up as if he ’s in the bush			1
’ prince @entity9 and prince @entity22 carried out their first official tour together in 2010 , spending six days @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity37 ( top right ) they visited orphanages , schools and other important projects , as well as seeing the spectacular wildlife in the region			1
@entity9 has said that he wants @entity7 to experience the same things and be inspired in the same way he was , starting with around his cot			1
' i ’ll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room			0
we ’ll cover it in sort of , you know , lots of bushes and things like that ' , he said			0
‘ i did the first nappy , yeah , ’ he said			2
‘ a badge of honour , exactly			0
i was n’t allowed to get away with that			0
i had every midwife staring at me , “ you do it			0
‘ he ’s growing quite quickly actually			0
but he ’s a little fighter			0
he kind of , he wriggles around quite a lot			0
‘ and he does n’t want to go to sleep that much , which is a little bit of a problem ... ’ mr @entity31 asked : ‘ so you ’re up a little bit at night ? ’ ‘ a little bit , ’ @entity9 replied			1
‘ not as much as @entity82			2
but , you know , she ’s doing a fantastic job [ she ’s doing ] very well			0
’ the couple are clearly making sure their cocker spaniel , @entity230 , does n’t feel neglected			2
he said : ‘ for me , @entity82 , and now little @entity7 are my priorities			1
he ’s coping all right , actually			0
as a lot of people know who have got dogs and are bringing newborn back , they take a little bit of time to adapt , but , no he ’s been all right so far			0
‘ he ’s been slobbering sort of around the house a bit , so he ’s perfectly happy			0
’ and although it was perhaps not terribly politically correct to admit it , @entity9 also joked that it would be a relief to return to work as an @entity249 pilot based on @entity250 , @entity251			1
he returned to work on august 7 after a fortnight ’s statutory paternity leave , and was finally joined by @entity109 and their son early last week			0
he said : ‘ well , as a few fathers might know , i ’m actually quite looking forward to going back to work			0
so i ’m just hoping the first few shifts i go back i do n’t have any night jobs			0
’ in depth : @entity9 and the @entity32 anchor walk the grounds of @entity46 , where @entity7 will be brought up in the same flat once occupied by the @entity264 's sister @entity263 hopes : the @entity9 spoke of his desire to allow his son to see @entity37 and its amazing wildlife in the same way he and prince @entity22 did as boys friendly : journalist @entity31 with the prince , who spoke to @entity32 because he wanted to ensure more people in @entity42 and around the world heard about the work of @entity277 having fun : prince @entity9 tickles a young child in @entity188 , southern @entity37 , and the future king says he would like his son to experience the continent when he grows up @entity9 also discussed his hope that one day @entity7 will have the same love of @entity37 that he had @entity22 did as boys			1
his own passion for the continent was instilled in him by his father , prince @entity288 , and his late mother @entity289			2
@entity9 said he planned to introduce @entity37 and its endangered species to his young son in his @entity46 nursery at an early age			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ you talked about your father possibly whispering [ sweet nothings ] quietly in your ear as a young boy			0
are you going to do the same for @entity7 because it ’s such a cause that you care so deeply about ? ’ @entity9 replied : ‘ probably			1
i ’ll have toy elephants and rhinos around the room			0
we ’ll cover it in , you know , lots of bushes and things like that			0
make him grow up as if he ’s in the bush			0
