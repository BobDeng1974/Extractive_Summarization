@entity0 can add ' weatherman ' to his already dizzying array of talents , according to a new book			2
geologist and @entity7 art expert @entity5 claims the artist , architect , musician , mathematician , engineer , inventor , anatomist , geologist , cartographer , botanist and writer was also the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane			1
she came to this conclusion after seeing drawings of biblical floods by @entity0 in the @entity27 at @entity28 and outlines them in her book @entity30			0
vortex : geologist and @entity7 art expert @entity5 claims @entity0 to the first to see the swirling patterns of water and air at the heart of a hurricane , as evidenced by this drawing was @entity0 once again hundreds of years ahead of his time ? right , a satellite image of a hurricane @entity5 says the sketches , drawn between 1514 and 1518 , reveal the distinctive ' vortex flow patterns ' discovered by meteorologists in the 1970s using satellite technology			1
' i found something extraordinary , ' she told @entity44			0
' these patterns are similar to hurricane configurations so familiar to us today			1
' some of them swirl in a clockwise direction and some anti-clockwise			0
that 's very much what happens in the atmosphere			2
her theory has been backed by professor @entity56 , chief executive of the @entity57			0
the inventor came up with designs for tanks and helicopters and in 2008 a @entity63 daredevil trusted to his genius by creating a parachute from one of his designs however , a @entity69 scholar says @entity0 is known to have observed numerous natural phenomena and claims the vortices could easily represent something else			1
