it 's not hard to pick the chick out in this huge colony of king penguins			1
the solitary young bird stands out from the crowd as it wanders among the large group - made up of around 200,000 penguins - at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
while the fluffy chick is distinguishable for the rest because of its warm coat of feathers , the other penguins surrounding him are older and have the typical , black and white ' tuxedo ' tone			1
the 49 - year - old said : ' there are certain rules when visiting this part of the island			2
' for example , it is forbidden to approach penguins closer than five metres , otherwise you will frighten the birds			2
' one shaggy , brown bird in the photograph is a king penguin chick			1
' he waits on the banks for his parents who go to the sea to get food			0
returning , the parents seek out their young among the thousands of the same brown lumps			2
' perhaps the penguin was hungry and went looking for his parents and has obviously ended up in the middle of the other older penguins			0
' i love the contrast between the single brown chick and the beautiful adult birds , who look like they are dressed in their ' tuxedos '			0
' baby penguins , known as woollies , keep their brown downy feathers for a year , while they develop a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm through the winter			1
king penguin chicks are cared for by their parents for around 40 days before they join a ' creche ' for warmth and protection from predators			0
their parents return occasionally during the winter to feed them			0
males incubate the eggs much like emperor penguins , but @entity89 penguins do this during the warmer summer season			0
the female goes to the open sea to feed and return in about 21 days so the male only goes a month without food			0
change : the @entity24 chick on the right has patchy brown feathers			2
young penguins tend to have their feathers for a year snapped : a photographer bends down to take a picture of the young penguins , who have begun to shed their brown feathers			1
