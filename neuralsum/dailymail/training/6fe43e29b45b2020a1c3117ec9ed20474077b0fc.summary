@entity2 extremists in @entity3 and @entity4 could be defeated within six months if @entity5 and @entity6 sent in ground troop , ex-army chief @entity0 has claimed			1
the former head of the @entity9 said it was ' naïve ' to think @entity11 could be overcome without ' boots on the ground ' and greater involvement by western armies			1
@entity16 has ruled out using ground troops in the conflict , as ministers stepped up calls for @entity21 to step in to defeat forces threatening a key town close to their border with @entity3			1
but lord @entity0 said western troops would need to be sent in to tackle the threat posed by @entity11			1
he told @entity41 : ' if western boots were on the ground , if western armies were to be applied to the problem [ of @entity46 ] , it could be over in six months			2
' he stressed that @entity5 soldiers being sent in was ' not going to happen , clearly ' but he said the option should remain on the table			2
' the idea that you can make [ the @entity27 or the @entity52 ] successful in the time we have available to us ... without much more active and fulsome western involvement is , i think , naive			0
' defence secretary @entity56 today called on @entity21 to do more to tackle the threat from @entity2 extremists on its border with @entity3 the @entity5 government has insisted that the response to the rise of @entity11 must involve an international coalition , including countries from the region			1
there are growing fears that the lightly armed @entity70 defenders in @entity71 - just inside @entity3 - could be overrun by @entity11 fighters			1
defence secretary @entity56 today urged the @entity21 government to become more involved			0
' @entity21 certainly could help			0
it is a matter for @entity21 , but other allies in the region have been helping , ' he told the @entity78 today programme			0
' this is a situation that can only be resolved , not just by @entity6 and @entity5 , but by the region itself so we 'd certainly like to see @entity21 more involved but in the end it is a decision for their government			2
' @entity21 tanks secure their border area as airstrikes are carried out by an alleged alliance war plane on @entity46 targets in the west of @entity94 , @entity3 mr @entity56 warned that if @entity11 - also referred to as @entity11 ( @entity46 in @entity3 and the @entity95 ) and @entity46 - was not stopped , it would have severe consequences for the entire region			1
' clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to dealing with @entity11 otherwise we will have @entity4 falling apart and @entity3 falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region , ' he said			2
last month the @entity103 voted in favour of air strikes , but only in @entity4			0
today mr @entity56 made clear that ministers do not believe that @entity107 is ready to authorise the extension of military action into @entity3			0
' we do n't have authority from @entity107 to operate in @entity3 at the moment			0
' our judgment at the moment is that @entity107 would n't give us that authority , ' he said .			0
