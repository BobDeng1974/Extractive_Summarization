it 's a sight that suddenly makes a repetitive 9 - 5 job look a whole lot more appealing			0
the incredible video shows a glimpse in the day of what is surely the worst job in the world - a human pipe cleaner			1
in the footage , which was published on @entity11 , the sewer worker is seen being dunked into blocked drains by his colleagues in @entity15 , western @entity16			1
the workman is dangled for around 30 seconds , before he is slowly lifted , inch by inch , out of the hole			2
he then appears from the sewer feet first , before clambering out of the hole and stepping back into broad daylight			2
the man - who emerges looking relatively unscathed - then casually walks away from the camera , ready for the next instalment of his daily dunking			0
the workman , who is donning red overalls , is helped scramble out of the hole by his two colleagues			0
