under the policy shift , driven by new @entity13 strategy chief @entity12 , the prime minister would scrap plans to hold the ‘ in / out ’ referendum in 2017 and instead stage the crucial vote a year earlier			1
the plans emerged amid dire warnings from senior @entity19 that the referendum row was ‘ tearing the @entity20 apart ’ and could result in an early general election			1
@entity6 ( left ) could bring forward the crucial vote by a year under the plans in an effort to fend off the threat from @entity9 in the commons this week , up to 100 @entity13 mps are set to take the extraordinary step of condemning their own @entity30 ’s @entity29 for failing to enshrine mr @entity6 ’s referendum promise in law			1
the prime minister is likely to be out of the country for the vote but no 10 sources indicated last night that @entity13 ministers will be ‘ guided ’ to abstain – to the fury of their @entity20 partners			1
it raises the highly unusual prospect of conservative cabinet ministers deciding to sit on their hands in implicit criticism of a programme of legislation they helped to draft			0
the prime minister is said to be ‘ relaxed ’ and happy to give backbench mps a free vote on the issue			2
but former @entity20 leader sir @entity52 claimed that it was ‘ madness ’ to consider quitting the @entity5			2
he also warned that if the @entity20 collapsed ‘ in a flurry of dissent and bad temper ’ , it would be difficult to see his party co-operating with the @entity59 in any future pact			1
sir @entity52 told @entity62 : ‘ if it ends with the parties at each other ’s throats , that would be meat and drink to @entity69 and @entity9			0
‘ if this experiment in @entity20 ends in mutual recriminations , the chances of a similar arrangement in the future will be greatly reduced			2
’ former @entity20 leader sir @entity52 claimed that it was ' madness ' to consider quitting the @entity5 one senior @entity78 source claims that mr @entity12 has warned mr @entity6 that 2017 is too far away to have any real electoral impact – and that the prime minister must stress that he would back an ‘ out ’ vote if he failed to negotiate an acceptable new settlement with @entity83			1
mr @entity12 has reportedly advised that the next @entity13 manifesto should contain a pledge to hold a vote by 2016 so that the party can promise the public ’s ‘ voice will be heard ’ within a year of the poll			1
another source claimed that mr @entity6 ’s referendum pledge in january had been rushed out after he was mistakenly informed that @entity93 was poised to beat him to it			0
the source said a @entity13 mp reported back to no 10 in early december that he had overheard @entity98 – a key aide to the @entity52 – speaking loudly on a mobile phone in the @entity27 about ‘ beating @entity6 to the punch ’ by promising a referendum first			2
‘ as a result we have needlessly backed ourselves into a corner , ’ the source added			0
mr @entity98 last night denied ever advocating such a tactic			0
yesterday , mr @entity93 ruled out making such a pledge and accused the @entity59 of plunging the country into years of uncertainty over @entity5 membership			0
