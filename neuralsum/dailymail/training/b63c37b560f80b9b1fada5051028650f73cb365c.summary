mr @entity3 said : ' when lightning hits something it can cause enormous damage			2
it has been very upsetting			0
' the house might have to be rebuilt - i am waiting to hear what the structural engineer says about it			0
' it could be that the house itself is not safe enough to live in , in which case it would be a waste of money to start doing repairs			0
' so i will leave it to the experts to establish whether or not the house is repairable			0
' the lightning tore the four - foot hole in the roof above his bedroom on october 6			1
he added : ' they say lightning does n't strike twice , but in a sense it has hit me twice because of the burglary last year			0
