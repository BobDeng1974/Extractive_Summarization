by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity2 and @entity3 fans are clearly delighted with the £ 10million purchase of @entity5 as a replacement for @entity7 , who headed to @entity8 once his contract expired			1
but the domino effect means @entity11 can be satisfied with a smooth bit of transfer business themselves that , statistically , looks even shrewder			0
@entity16 arriving on @entity17 for £ 5m after a fine season with @entity19 and impressive @entity20 with @entity21 is something the @entity23 can crow about			1
for example , the @entity34 defeats the @entity36 in both total score and defence score for the 2013/14 season			0
these scores are produced by an advanced algorithm that evaluates the outcome of every recorded on - ball action , such as passing , tackling , and chances created ( as detailed by @entity45 )			0
@entity16 scores 23.38 points overall , compared to @entity5 ’s 14.69 points , while defensive scores are 9.87 to 8.99 in favour of the new @entity11 right - back			1
@entity16 played 2,644 domestic minutes , while @entity5 appeared a similar 2,491 minutes			2
moving on : @entity7 left @entity3 at the end of his contract and will be at @entity8 next season @entity16 completed 38.20 passes per match at 82 per cent success rate , while @entity5 made 25.14 passes with 73 per cent success			1
@entity16 also had five assists to three			0
@entity5 shaded tackles per game ( 2.45 to 2.20 ) and was a clear winner in interceptions per game ( 2.38 to 1.47 ) but committed more fouls ( 1.41 to 0.83 )			0
a quite understandable argument could be made that @entity5 was performing in the @entity68 for a team who occasionally struggled , while @entity16 was turning out in the weaker @entity71 for a side who finished second			2
upgrade : new @entity11 signing @entity16 poses for photo after joining @entity11 fill @entity5 hole with @entity16 and it is true that when their respective @entity20 performances are assessed the numbers are closer and in some cases favour @entity5			1
@entity16 remains the better attacking presence with a score of 6.58 points to 4.34 points , however			0
strong at the back : @entity5 looked good at the back for @entity87 impressive tournament : @entity16 played well for @entity21 in @entity89 it remains to be seen how he adopts to the pace and physicality of the @entity68 , and @entity2 will know the premium paid for @entity5 is because of his @entity95 experience			2
but for a profit of £ 5m , @entity11 have a very good player who can rival , and in some cases better , the man he replaces .			1

@entity5 moved to @entity3 for £ 10m
@entity11 signed and @entity16 from @entity19 for £ 5m
@entity16 has impressive stats and could be a star at @entity105
