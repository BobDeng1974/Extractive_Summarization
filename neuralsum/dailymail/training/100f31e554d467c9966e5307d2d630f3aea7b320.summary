' the revelations have also sparked a feud between @entity7 and @entity8 sheriff @entity90 , who has accused the @entity9 of using his position to mislead the public			1
' in my view , mr. @entity7 ’s comments and actions would seem to suggest that , if he could have his own way , mr. @entity14 would never have been brought to justice for his crime and mr @entity7 ’s relationship with him would have never been brought to the light of public scrutiny , ' @entity90 said in a statement			2
