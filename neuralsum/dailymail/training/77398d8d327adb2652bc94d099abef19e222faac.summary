by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:10 est , 11 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:22 est , 11 december 2013 @entity3 won the hearts of women worldwide back in 2004 when he played lovestruck teen @entity6 in @entity7 and has kept us enthralled ever since , earning himself a reputation as one of @entity12 's biggest heartthrobs			1
but one beauty blogger has accused the actor of having a little helping hand in the looks department in the form of a nose job			1
hey girl , prepare for a lot of hate mail			0
beauty blogger @entity22 has accused @entity3 of having gone under the knife to straighten , thin and refine his nose on beauty website @entity25			1
surely not ? his good looks may have won over the world 's females , but one beauty blogger thinks @entity3 has had some help from surgery analysing photos of the @entity35 taken over the years , @entity33 observes : ' do you think his nose is a little thinner , shorter , straighter and less projecting now ? '			1
comparing photos from his @entity41 club days in the late 90s to shots from 2007 , she muses : ' the bridge looks straighter , so it ’s possible that he may have already had the “ work ” done by this point			0
or had repeat nose jobs			2
' using present day photos to illustrate her point , she concludes : ' i say it ’s straighter , the tip has been removed and the nostrils have been refined - but we ’re talking tiny , tiny			0
to me , his nose clearly looks quite different compared to the early days			2
' has he or has n't he ? @entity33 uses photos of @entity3 back in 2001 , aged 21 , ( l ) and compares them to today ( r ) to ponder over his possible rhinoplasty so is @entity33 alone in her thoughts ? celebrity plastic surgeon dr @entity63 , @entity64 at 111 @entity65 , said : ' although subtle , in my opinion , it ’s clear from these images that there have been number of changes made to @entity3 ’s nose			1
' rhinoplasty is one of the most common surgical procedures carried out at my @entity78 clinic and during an initial consultation i always advise patients that any alterations to their nose should not only resemble the original but should complement existing facial features			2
' even though my patients have differing concerns , almost all request minor alterations as they do n’t want to dramatically change their appearance			0
this is also evident in @entity3 ’s images			1
comparisons : @entity92 wrote the article on beauty editor and used several old and new photos of @entity3 to illustrate her point ' in @entity3 ’s case , his nose at the beginning of his career is significantly wider at the bridge and has a prominent hump			1
fast forward ten years and both of these features appear altered			0
' although rhinoplasty is a relatively simple procedure a result like this will have taken several steps to achieve			0
' firstly , the nasal tip has been slightly rotated upwards and reduced in size by the removal of cartilage			0
in addition , the bridge has been lowered and made narrower to remove the slight hump , creating a straight , symmetrical look			0
' helpless @entity3 is n't the only star that @entity92 has accused of surgery			1
she has also posted photos of stars such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 to determine if they ’ve also had rhinoplasties , injections or any other procedures			0
@entity3 won the hearts of women worldwide back in 2004 when he played lovestruck teen @entity6 in @entity7 alongside @entity130			2
