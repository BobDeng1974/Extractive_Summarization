@entity1 @entity0 have made a bleak assessment of @entity4 soldiers after a doomed mission this year when many of the soldiers refused to show up and those who did refused to fight and hid behind rocks			1
the @entity11 forces reportedly could not operate at night and were so unprepared that the @entity12 had to take the lead			1
then , when the mission was only half finished , the @entity11 soldiers quit , retreated to the trees and refused to push on			1
the @entity0 soldiers , among the most elite and best - trained in the @entity12 military , filed those reports in a declassified @entity22 briefing about the june friendly fire bombinh that left five @entity12 and one @entity11 soldier dead			1
unprepared : a report by @entity27 officers paints a bleak picture of @entity4 preparedness as @entity12 forces prepare to pull out @entity0 : special forces soldiers are some of the most highly trained commandos in the @entity12 military with specialized skills for working with local soldiers like the @entity4 a captain from fifth @entity0 based out of @entity37 , @entity38 , reported the dramatic shortcomings of @entity11 soldiers as he defended the actions of his own troops , the @entity35 reports			1
his assessment is sharply different from the picture of the @entity4 projected by the @entity22 as the @entity12 military			2
notably , @entity0 soldiers are specifically trained and educated on how to instruct and work with foreign soldiers in their own country			1
it is the primary mission of the @entity0 , which they have been performing around the world since the 1950s			0
on sunday , the @entity12 - led coalition formally ended combat operations in the volatile @entity53 and @entity12 @entity54 and @entity56 troops handed over their bases there to @entity11 commanders			1
all but 12,500 coalition troops will pull out of @entity11 by the end of 2014 , leaving the @entity4 to protect the fragile nation from a resurgent @entity62			2
according to the @entity35 , the mission on june 5 began badly when far fewer @entity11 troops showed up than had been requested by the @entity0			2
' they do not always show up with the forces promised			0
this was not ideal , ' the @entity12 officer wrote			0
too few @entity11 soldiers show up , and those who do show up are often reluctant to fight , the @entity0 claimed in a new report the mission was to clear a valley of @entity62 fighters so that local residents could vote in the @entity11 election			1
the insurgents had vowed to attack polling places and voters in an attempt to scare @entity11 away			0
when the troops were flown into the valley , the captain writes , ' the ( @entity0 ) took point due to the @entity4 â€™s inability to move during periods of darkness			0
' as the forces began clearing the valley , the @entity0 noted that most of the soldiers refused to move out in the open and instead hid in the ' green zone ' - a swath of protected trees			2
@entity93 through the mission , the @entity0 report , the @entity11 soldiers just gave up			1
' the ( @entity0 ) recommended to the ( @entity11 commander ) to move positions and continue clearing further down the valley			0
the ( commander ) claimed to have cleared the entire valley but our positions identified that they had cleared only half of the valley			0
according to the ( commander ) that was as much clearance as they were going to conduct			0
' then , after an @entity12 bomber killed five @entity12 and an @entity11 in a friendly fire accident , the @entity0 told the remaining @entity11 soldiers to form a perimeter so that the rescue and recovery operation could begin			1
' they instead huddled behind a rock , ' a @entity27 wrote			0
@entity22 investigators largely blamed the @entity0 soldiers for the errant bombing in the report , which was released last month			2
they said that the elite soldiers had ' poor situational awareness ' when they called in the air strike			0
the bomber crew was blamed for failing to correctly identify the target .			0

reports from @entity0 officers differ dramatically from the rosy picture of the @entity4 painted by the @entity22
@entity0 are specially trained to instruct and work with foreign soldiers in their country
@entity11 soldiers could not operate at night
they were quit halfway through the mission and refused to go on
report comes from a june operation that resulted in a ' friendly fire ' bombing that killed five @entity12
@entity12 forces will end combat operations at by end of 2014 and hand defense over to the @entity4
