by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 17:25 est , 6 july 2013 nobody seems to love @entity2 , and with good reason			1
it is by far the largest , and possibly the craziest , infrastructure project in @entity7 history			1
it will destroy town and country the length of the land			1
it is presented as a much - needed boost for the economy , but the boost will likely come during the next boom , when such reckless public spending will seem foolish			2
elaborate plans : former @entity7 rail board member @entity0 says the @entity2 is total waste of money since @entity2 is ‘ premium fare ’ , its chief beneficiaries will be existing first - class passengers out of @entity27			1
this may be a deserving group , but they are hardly the poor struggling masses yearning to breathe free			2
yet @entity31 wants to subsidise them to the tune of £ 1,000 from every taxpayer in the land			1
last week the government admitted yet another hike in @entity2 spending , from £ 33 billion to £ 43 billion			1
the criticism became a deluge			2
@entity41 , chairman of the @entity42 , called it ‘ complete madness ’			2
one of her @entity46 members , @entity47 , added : ‘ everyone thinks it ’s going to be £ 70 billion , £ 80 billion , £ 100 billion by the time it ’s finished			1
’ that is double the present estimate			2
last month the @entity53 declared even the existing case for the project at best unproven			1
the proclaimed increase in business hours was declared minimal , since people can now work on a train			2
the list of @entity2 ’s opponents would fill a page and embrace most of its original architects , such as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity64 called it a ‘ con on the north ’			2
@entity66 admitted last week that it was always a political project , intended ‘ to paint an upbeat view of the future ’			1
city leaders in @entity74 and @entity75 supported it , but were not asked if they would prefer the money for something else , such as urban transit systems , a new trans - @entity81 link or an extension to the @entity84			2
the railway has opponents as diverse as the @entity87 and the @entity88 , the @entity90 magazine and the environmentalist @entity91 , the @entity92 , the @entity93 , the @entity94 , the @entity95 and wildlife trusts galore			2
in a savage letter to @entity98 , @entity99 , former boss of the first @entity101 link , @entity102 , said claims being made for the new line were ‘ away with the fairies ’			0
@entity2 ’s friends are almost exclusively those with a political or financial interest in it			1
the @entity109 , @entity110 , asserts that it will ‘ bridge the north - south gap ’ and ‘ compete with @entity112 ’			0
limited benefit : the plan has come under increasing criticism , with even former labour business secretary @entity66 warning that it could be an ' expensive mistake ' he does not explain why competing with @entity112 means avoiding the existing @entity27 - @entity119 transport corridor and crashing through some of the loveliest country in @entity122			0
@entity110 and the line ’s chief cheerleader , @entity123 , deflect criticism from this geographical nonsense by claiming @entity2 will at least liberate capacity on lines into @entity27			1
since it is premium class , it will do so in a very limited way			0
nor does the minister explain why the train is to arrive at @entity27 and not link with either @entity134 or the @entity136 terminal at @entity137			0
it does not even link to @entity140 ’s new @entity139			1
the ‘ train of the future ’ will reach neither of @entity140 ’s international transport hubs			1
i served on the @entity146 in the 1990s			0
every investment battle was between glamour projects that appealed to ministers and the mundane needs of passengers			0
the railway was still only half electrified and much of its signalling was @entity154 , yet time and money were exhausted on building a tilting train that never worked			0
every train pundit knows that the quickest and cheapest way to increase capacity is to re-engineer platforms , signals and rolling stock			0
the 2012 @entity165 report on alternatives to @entity2 ( now forgotten ) showed that redeveloping @entity27 could deliver a cost - benefit ratio of one to four – twice the benefit of @entity2			1
threat : the @entity171 countryside where the proposed @entity2 link between @entity140 and @entity75 may run @entity7 ’s conventional railway desperately needs investment			1
it is shaming , long after most of the rest of @entity177 is electrified , that diesels still leave @entity179 for the west country and chug round most of the feeder lines on the network			0
cross-country services into @entity184 are dire			0
if @entity110 wants to reduce overloading , he should look at the commuter lines in the @entity189 area , in @entity190 and in @entity191			0
yet he is blowing the lion ’s share of rail investment for 20 years on a well - heeled group at @entity27			2
to oppose @entity2 is not to be nimbyist , much as some ministers like to see things that way			1
there is no overriding national interest in tearing up open countryside when other means of transport are available			0
there are 100 more productive uses for £ 50 billion of infrastructure spending			1
new motorways would deliver four to five times more economic benefit than @entity2			1
the parallel is exact with @entity209 in the 1970s , a high - profile project that played to @entity212 ’s high - tech obsession			1
its backer was @entity215 , who fought against all attempts to kill it at birth , musing recently on the @entity219 that ‘ it will always be an icon ’			0
@entity209 was a taxpayer gift to the rich , a classic @entity221 - style grand project intended to yield political glory			2
@entity215 made it fly over the cabinet room to give his friends an exhilarating bang – the most expensive bang in history			0
concern : @entity0 says that claims for the line are ' away with the fairies ' high - speed trains are for long distances			1
@entity7 ’s compact geography and the need for frequent train stops make speed less critical to journey times			2
fast trains are also energy inefficient , necessitating an estimated 60 per cent more carbon than ordinary trains because , unlike in @entity221 , we have little benefit of nuclear power			0
even in @entity221 the @entity247 are losing their glamour			0
they have led @entity221 railways into £ 34 billion of debt			1
a halt has been called to new lines and @entity253 has announced it will redirect investment to high - volume commuter lines			0
modern rail passengers in a country such as @entity7 want comfort and reliability rather than marginally faster journeys			0
time spent in trains is no longer seen as wasted			0
a wise railway goes for many small investments , not one big one			0
this leaves the intriguing question , if the case for @entity2 is so weak , how does it survive ? the answer was given by @entity269 in opposition			1
he warned that special interest lobbying ‘ has tainted our politics for too long , ’ and needed curbing			0
he has not curbed it			0
hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent by taxpayers on @entity2 , meaning a list of consultancies and contractors that is almost as long as that of the line ’s opponents			1
these lobbyists have open access to @entity285 , to ask ministers for ever more in the trough			0
@entity31 usually resists calls to spend public money			0
but curiously enough , when the @entity2 lobby arrives in @entity285 , his smile is wide and his pockets are deep			1
that is what @entity269 was talking about , once .			0

list of @entity2 ’s critics would fill a page and quite *rightly* , says @entity0
the huge project is expected to destroy *135* acres of ancient *woodland*
last week @entity303 admitted another hike in @entity2 cost to £ 43 billion
