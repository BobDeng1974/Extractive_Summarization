@entity0 pledged to crackdown on the illegal exploitation of migrant workers by promising a @entity5 task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers			1
exploitation has driven low - skilled migration and held down wages for @entity15 workers , the @entity10 leader said during an outing in @entity17 earlier today			1
a new unit of 100 staff would work with the @entity20 , specialist police units and @entity5 enforcement staff , he added			2
but @entity23 and @entity25 immigration minister @entity24 dismissed mr @entity0 's ideas and said he was doing nothing to control immigration			2
he told @entity40 : ' it 's a big diversion			1
is he right that some people who come here are exploited and abused ? yes of course he 's right , there 's no doubt there are problems out there			0
' but it is not the main issue			1
the main issue is we have too many people allowed to come here which is pushing down people 's wages			1
' in his speech mr @entity0 insisted that there was an ' epidemic of exploitation '			1
he said : ' so many of the secure jobs that once defined the places people live have gone			0
this is the story of our economy for so many people in this country			0
' and it is in these low skill , insecure workplaces where migrant labour is often concentrated			1
' too often this anything - goes economy damages the interests of the working people of the country			1
people who live in the most appalling , cramped conditions , sleeping 20 to a house ; people who are paid well below the minimum wage ; people who have their wages stolen			1
' but @entity23 ( right ) and @entity25 immigration minister @entity24 ( left ) dismissed mr @entity0 's ideas and said he was doing nothing to control immigration in his speech in @entity90 , northern @entity91 , mr @entity0 insisted that there was an ' epidemic of exploitation ' he added that the exploitation was driving down standards for other employers			1
' it makes it harder for responsible employers to do the right thing and pay decent wages , ' he said			1
' it is an epidemic of exploitation and we will end it			1
' he also used the speech to promise @entity10 would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration			1
this will include requiring people to speak @entity115 , particularly when they work in the public sector and @entity117			0
mr @entity0 said : ' @entity10 got it wrong in the past			0
we have learned and we have changed			0
' let me be clear			0
it is not prejudiced to be concerned about immigration			0
as prime minister , i will always address concerns not ignore them			0
as prime minister , i will always put working families first			0
' that 's why we 'll have proper controls and rules because at the heart of our programme in 2015 is working people			0
' he even referred to his parents fleeing to @entity15 from @entity137 in an attempt to win the audience round			0
the @entity10 leader , pictured greeting staff and students at @entity142 , also used the speech to promise @entity10 would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration meanwhile prime minister @entity148 ( left ) took part the @entity151 procession at @entity152 with his wife @entity153 ( right ) he said : ' they found a country that welcomed them and offered them the opportunity to build a new life			1
to work hard and make a contribution			0
' i would n't be standing here today , asking you to elect me your prime minister , if it was n't for the generosity of this great country			2
' @entity169 , general secretary of the building workers union @entity170 , said : ' this commitment demonstrates that @entity10 is serious about ending the misery caused by the exploitation of migrant workers and rightly targets the employers who profit through the mistreatment of workers			2
’ but mr @entity24 , speaking before mr @entity0 's speech , said that ' nothing ' in @entity10 ’s proposal would help			2
he said : ' @entity10 sent out " search parties for people " and under them net migration increased more than five-fold			2
' since 2010 , the @entity25 have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students , cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages , made it harder for people to live in the @entity15 illegally and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop spurious attempts to remain in the country			0
' and the next @entity25 government will seek changes to the operation of @entity200 free movement rules as a key part of our plan to renegotiate @entity15 's relationship with the @entity205			0
‘ a vote for @entity0 would risk all of that with a @entity10 - @entity208 stitch up			2

exploitation drives low - skilled migration and holds down wages , he said
speech given during an outing in *marginal* seat @entity17 earlier today
