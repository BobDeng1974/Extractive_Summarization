a burka ban will be brought in by the government of @entity4 ’s @entity3 region in the wake of a @entity6 ruling that banning veils does not breach human rights laws			1
@entity9 , interior minister for @entity3 , said that the ban , first proposed in 2013 , was in no way an attack on religious freedom as the wearing of helmets and masks in public will also be forbidden			1
@entity9 announced that the @entity19 government aimed to get the ban approved after the summer 2014 recess , @entity17 reported			2
reasoning : @entity9 , interior minister for @entity3 , said that the burka ban , first proposed in 2013 , was in no way an attack on religious freedom the @entity6 based its ruling on a test case from @entity29			1
it was brought by a @entity29 woman in her mid- 20s who is a devout @entity31 no longer allowed to wear in public the burka , which covers the whole body , or the full - face niqab veil , because a new @entity29 law prohibits concealment of the face in public places			2
she complained that the new law , which came into force in april 2011 , infringed the @entity41 because it amounted to discrimination on grounds of sex , religion and ethnic origin			0
but the @entity6 ruled that promoting respect for the conditions in which people ' live together ' in public places was a legitimate aim justifying the ban and did not breach the convention			1
following the ruling , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 may also ban the burka			1
members of @entity55 's @entity61 said that there was no compulsion in @entity64 to wear a full - face veil , and so any ban would not constitute an attack on religious freedoms			1
@entity61 spokeswoman @entity69 told @entity17 that in the ' wide , conservative circles of @entity64 immigration society ' , the opinion prevails that women are second - class citizens			0
one of the many instruments for oppressing women is the burka , she added			0
conclusion : the @entity6 ( pictured ) based its ruling that a burka ban does not breach human rights on a test case from @entity29 in @entity57 a ban was last discussed between 2009 and 2010 but was quickly shot down in the belief that the @entity6 would rule against it			1
but now @entity83 , a member of the anti-immigration @entity84 , says the legal framework for a ban has been laid down			0
he told @entity88 : ' [ a ban ] would send the signal that we do not accept parallel societies and isolation			0
we see [ the burka ] as a rejection of @entity57 society			1
' it is a sign that one wishes to distance themselves from the rest of society			0
' meanwhile the @entity102 parties in @entity56 welcomed the ban , and suggested they may also raise the issue again			2
former @entity106 leader @entity105 said the judgement was positive , and recognised that hiding behind a veil meant other members of your community struggled to relate to you			0
@entity113 mp @entity112 , meanwhile , urged the government to press on with banning the veil in @entity115			0
he said : ' finally , at long last , we have had a sensible decision from the @entity6 about something			2
' we will never have a fully functioning , fully integrated multi-cultural society if growing numbers of our citizens go around with their faces covered			0

@entity3 interior minister said ban was not an attack on religious freedom
@entity6 said that a burka ban does not breach human rights
following the ruling , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 may also ban the burka
