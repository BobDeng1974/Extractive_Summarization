@entity13 coroner @entity27 said the water must be made less attractive to swimmers at an inquest into mr @entity9 's death , @entity13 coroner @entity27 said the water at @entity12 should be dyed black to make it less attractive to swimmers			1
she said other options could include ' aggressively ' planting nettles and having warning signs in foreign languages so there could be no mistaking the danger			1
the @entity41 inquest heard how mr @entity9 , from @entity42 , @entity13 , drowned as he tried to swim to an island to join his girlfriend @entity44			1
ms @entity44 told the hearing how she watched mr @entity9 get into difficulties , then swam out to help			2

he said in a breathless voice ' get me a stick , get me a log '			0
' she said : ' i ripped off a branch and swam out to him			0
i held the branch but it would n't float ... i grabbed his arm and started to pull him			0
i was being pulled under and i had to swim back to the side			0
' location : @entity61 is a beauty spot close to the town of @entity42 in northern @entity13 hidden danger : swimming is banned at @entity12 because of near - invisible weeds below the surface ' as i swam back i could see him going under			1
i looked back and i saw the bubbles where @entity9 had been			2
' police and fire teams were called but the police officers at the scene were unable to help as they were not strong enough swimmers , the inquest heard			0
mr @entity9 's body was eventually recovered by fire crews around 7.30pm that night - two hours before mr @entity10 's was recovered from a nearby lake			2

a postmortem later confirmed that 16 - year - old mr @entity10 , who was originally from @entity82 in @entity83 but had been living in @entity84 , @entity85 , also died by drowning			2
signs : swimmers continually ignore warning signs at @entity12			0
coroner @entity27 suggested the waters are circled by stinging nettles to prevent swimmers accessing them speaking outside the inquest earlier in the week , mr @entity9 's best friend @entity93 , who was also with him on the day he died , told the @entity95 : ' he was the sort of guy that if he knew someone was in trouble , he would have gone out of his way to help them out			1
' he said mr @entity9 was a good swimmer and had thought he was joking when he first appeared to be in trouble			0
' as soon as he did n't come back up again we realised that he was n't and that something was seriously wrong '			0
last summer a @entity105 in @entity106 was dyed black to deter swimmers from entering the toxic water .			2

@entity9 , 41 , and @entity10 , 16 , drowned in separate incidents
