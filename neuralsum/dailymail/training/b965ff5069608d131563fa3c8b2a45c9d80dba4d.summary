by @entity1 reporter published : 14:21 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 26 november 2013 a devastated family fear false widow spiders killed three of their beloved pet guinea pigs			1
@entity5 , nine , made the discovery after going to feed @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity9 at his home in @entity11 , @entity12			1
mother @entity13 said her son asked her if she had ever seen a guinea pig asleep before realising something was wrong			1
a devastated family fear false widow spiders killed three of their beloved pet guinea pigs mrs @entity19 , a childminder , said she found three of their five pet guinea pigs dead , with six false widow spiders and cobwebs around the hutch			1
the false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in @entity29			1
mrs @entity19 said : ' @entity5 told me they were asleep			1
he saw mummy upset and i told him what had happened			0
' i am a childminder and we had children over - a lot of kids saw what happened			0
' we do n't want this happening to anyone else			0
we want to make as many people aware of this as possible			0
' i am not scared of spiders and i 've never been bothered about them until these ones			1
discovery : @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity9 which were found dead surrounded by false widow spiders and cobwebs ' it 's a rarity to be bitten and react badly but i have seen some horrific things happening to people recently			1
' my husband @entity53 had to go out and get them			0
they had a look of agony on their faces			0
he 's a tough guy but it was not good for him			0
' mrs @entity19 said her home backs onto a primary school and fears the spiders may have made their way onto its playing field			2
insect expert @entity67 from the @entity68 said it is unlikely the spiders killed the guinea pigs			2
he said : ' it could only have happened if the guinea pigs attacked the spiders and i can not imagine a guinea pig attacking anything			2
' the spiders are distinctive for their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			2
millions of false widows , @entity29 's most poisonous spider , are found across the @entity29 and the population is growing			1
also known as steatoda nobilis , it is frequently confused for the black widow , which has deadly venom			2
the false widow was first spotted in the @entity29 in @entity92 , @entity93 , in 1879			1
it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from @entity98 or the @entity99 in a shipment of bananas			0
the species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull			0
they have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size			0
the @entity109 says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the @entity29 , having been found mainly in southern @entity112			1
this theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to @entity117 to avoid bites and what to do if you get onethe key message is that you should n't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened			2
to avoid it while asleep , remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs			2
do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight			1
if you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and can not see inside			0
also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things			0
if you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction , pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention .			0
