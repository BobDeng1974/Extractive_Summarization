analysts predict the @entity26 will be 3.3 per cent today , which would see regulated rail fares rise 4.3 per cent in january , well above average wage rises			1
the @entity19 warned some season tickets could rise 9 per cent against forecasts of a 2.4 per cent increase in average earnings next year			1
it said rail privatisation was costing taxpayers £ 1.2billion a year despite ‘ minimal ’ investment in trains and stations			1
general secretary @entity41 said : ‘ every year , hard - pressed rail commuters have to hand over an ever greater share of their earnings just to get to and from work			2
‘ wage - busting fare rises are not even going on much - needed service improvements			0
instead , passenger and public subsidies are lining the pockets of the shareholders of private rail companies			0

‘ this is helping to drive passenger satisfaction to near record levels while seeking to reduce taxpayers ’ contribution towards the cost of running the railways			0
‘ to help limit future fare rises , the rail industry is working with the government to find ways of providing services even more efficiently			0
