by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 are bright , sporty boys			2
seven - year - old @entity2 is a fan of martial arts while his elder brother @entity1 , 12 , would love to be a rugby player when he grows up			1
but , like many children , one of their favourite pastimes is playing computer games , and they spend hours every week playing on the family 's @entity12			1
like most modern parents , @entity14 , 39 , and her husband @entity15 , 45 , admit there 's a convenience factor in allowing their sons to play these games			1
but the couple , from @entity24 , @entity25 , are now fastidious about the security settings on their @entity12 , having learnt their lesson the hard - and expensive - way			1
concern : @entity30 and her grandson @entity31 , who unwittingly spent £ 3,500 playing games on her @entity12 ' we 've changed our password and disabled a setting which allowed the boys to purchase games or credits for a game without us knowing , ' says @entity14			1
' we 've added every parental control you can think of			2
' the couple are ever - vigilant because , two years ago , @entity2 racked up a debt of £ 1,200 on his mother 's debit card by playing a supposedly ‘ free ’ game on the @entity12			1
only five at the time , the youngster had no idea that the game , which encouraged him to purchase ' virtual zombie brains ' , would result in his parents paying real money			1
while they were stunned that their young son could run up such a debt , @entity14 , a business consultant , and @entity15 , a property developer , were lucky to be able to take the financial hit			2
but not every parent is as fortunate - and the consequences can be tragic			1
last month , an inquest heard how 13 - year - old @entity65 schoolboy @entity64 hanged himself after spending £ 422 online on @entity67 games			1
while the coroner ruled that @entity64 had intended to be found , the tragic incident happened after his mother confronted him over the bill			2
it makes me so cross that @entity75 target children with so - called " free " games then enable them to buy " add - ons " for extortionate sums of money numerous other children have unwittingly spent fortunes on their parents ' credit or debit cards			1
last summer , eight - year - old @entity86 , from @entity87 , ran up almost £ 4,000 , while @entity88 , eight , from @entity89 , spent £ 1,000			1
@entity90 , also from @entity89 , was five when he racked up a £ 1,700 bill on a zombie game			2
the first time @entity14 realised something was wrong was when she went to the cash machine and discovered her balance was £ 1,000 short			2
her bank told her the purchases had been made on @entity100 , @entity75 's media player which lets you download music , games and videos			1
' i knew it was n't me - i had n't bought anything from @entity100 recently , ' she says			1
' then i went into my account online and saw dozens of purchases			1
over a two to three - day period , one of my sons had spent £ 1,200 on a game where they had to pay to acquire virtual zombie brains			1
' it was part of a free game we 'd downloaded			2
i was n't aware you could spend money on it			2
i rang @entity75 , who were remarkably unhelpful			0
they said that as the purchases had been made legitimately , they could n't refund the money			1
innocent : many children are n't aware they are spending money when playing @entity12 games ( posed by models ) ' i told them it had been spent without my authorisation , but they just were n't interested			1
' we 'd always been careful to protect our @entity12 with a password and not to tell the boys what it was but , like every customer , we 'd had to input our card details to sign up to @entity100 , and these details were stored			0
' it turned out @entity2 had watched me inputting the password and memorised it			0
the game kept asking him if he wanted to buy more for £ 50 and he kept pressing the " yes " button			0
he did n't think he 'd spent " real money "			0
' dr @entity147 , a lecturer in computer science at the @entity149 , says incidents such incidents are common - and a major problem			1
' of course , a password is required , but even if a parent never lets their child know it , there are loopholes which allow a child to purchase without a parent 's knowledge , ' he says			0
@entity163 , 50 , found this out when she let her ten - year - old son , @entity165 , play a free game called @entity167 last year			1
when i got the bill , i was furious , but @entity165 genuinely did n't realise he 'd been spending money the housewife from @entity172 , north @entity173 , realised he 'd spent £ 250 only when she checked her email and found 28 @entity100 invoices			0
' @entity165 does n’t know my password , but one evening he 'd been playing a game with my permission and it kept asking if he wanted to go up a level , so he kept pressing " yes "			0
' when i got the bill , i was furious , but @entity165 genuinely did n't realise he 'd been spending money			0
he thought the game was offering him " prizes "			0
i rang @entity75 who said their terms and conditions meant they did n't have to give the money back			0
' that 's when @entity75 checked my account and found a 15 - minute time - limit setting on it , which allowed for purchases without a password as long as they were all made within 15 minutes of the first password being entered			1
' they said that @entity165 must have made all 28 purchases within that 15 - minute time - frame , but i thought that was impossible			1
' for two weeks i fought the decision , and three times @entity75 came back and said they would not refund the money			0
eventually , they backed down and paid it			0
' but they made it clear this was a once - only offer			2
they were very arrogant about it			0
it makes me so cross that @entity75 target children with so - called " free " games then enable them to buy " add - ons " for extortionate sums of money			1
' lesson learnt : the @entity213 eventually got their money back around 90 per cent of apps are now " freemium " - which means that the app is free to download but payments are required to unlock features or purchase extra items			1
many of these items are attractive to children , such as virtual jewels , sweets or zombie brains			2
a study last year revealed that parents had lost £ 30 million thanks to children 's unauthorised purchases			1
it 's a problem that extends far beyond the @entity232			0
recently in the @entity233 , @entity75 agreed to refund at least £ 66 million to parents whose children had racked up in - app bills			1
now , the @entity232 's @entity236 has announced the introduction of new in - app purchases standards , so that from april 1 , all apps should clearly disclose information about the costs associated with a game before it ’s downloaded			1
this all comes too late for @entity245 , 66 , whose grandson @entity31 , eight , spent £ 3,500 on his @entity12 last year while playing games such as @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250			2
@entity245 , a retired fire officer from @entity251 , says it was his wife @entity253 , 63 , a retired teacher , who noticed that something was awry			0
living online two in five children have internet access in their bedrooms by the time they leave primary school ' our @entity75 @entity100 account is connected to a bank account that we do n't use very often , and when @entity253 realised we were £ 1,300 overdrawn on it , we knew something was wrong , ' he says			2
the couple asked their grandchildren whether they had been buying anything online			0
' @entity31 looked a bit sheepish			0
he has adhd and can be manic at times , but when he 's playing on the @entity12 , he 's calm			0
so we downloaded some free games , not realising there is a 15 - minute slot when you can buy extras without having to put the card details back in			1
' when i found out what he 'd done , i was furious , but we could n't shout at him because he had n't realised what was happening			0
' when @entity245 contacted @entity75 , they offered to refund just £ 500 because of @entity31 's special needs			0
it was only when a journalist friend became involved that they agreed to pay back the full amount			0
' it 's a lot of money , so we were very grateful , ' says @entity245			0
' it 's a lesson for all of us			0
i 've heard of many others who have been in a similar situation			0
one friend 's son spent nearly £ 8,000 on his dad 's credit card			0
' i blame @entity75 , not the children			2
they 've made a lot of money out of it			0
' the @entity307 contacted @entity75 , but the company declined to comment .			0

comes after numerous of parents have received hefty bills
