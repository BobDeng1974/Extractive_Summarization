seven years ago this week , @entity0 was the only @entity1 reserve - team player to remain on the bench at a windswept and rain - lashed @entity3			1
the @entity1 ' second string had just beaten @entity7 rivals @entity5 3 - 1 but they did n't need a 17 - year - old @entity0			1
he was highly - rated but yet to make his senior bow and a loan spell at @entity10 beckoned			0
that same year he lost out to academy team - mate @entity11 in the @entity13 showdown			0
@entity11 now plays for @entity14 in the @entity15			0
@entity0 tussles with @entity1 's @entity16 during @entity18 's 1 - 0 win at the @entity19 @entity0 , however , is set to inherit the @entity18 captaincy from @entity22 - bound @entity21			1
on saturday , he was back at the club who sold him to the @entity25 for £ 20million in 2011			2
and , after @entity21 made way at half - time , we were afforded a 45 - minute snapshot of life with @entity0 as leader			1
it is now almost certain he will be appointed club captain in the summer			2
and , following the 1 - 0 win , @entity34 said : ' i 've already put him as vice-captain of the club			1
he 's grown , not just as a footballer , but as a young man over the past two - and - a - half years with me			2
you could see his quality and his leadership , his running ability and power			0
' he 's a fantastic young man and the reason for giving him that role ( vice-captain ) , was that for when @entity21 is n't on the field he 's a real leader for us			0
@entity21 was substituted at half - time and has agreed to join @entity22 side @entity52 in the summer ' there 's no question that he can go and become the captain at the club			1
' in the first half , with @entity21 at his side , the pair had bossed the contest , teasing passes between themselves and the outstanding @entity63 , outclassing and outworking their red - and - white adversaries			0
@entity65 , though , @entity0 assumed added responsibility			2
his first task was to take a necessary booking for his side , clipping the heels of @entity69 with the @entity1 winger in full flight and headed for a backpedaling rearguard			1
@entity0 assumed @entity18 's captaincy after @entity21 was taken off and impressed with his leadership conscious of his caution , @entity0 stationed himself at the centre of the park			1
from there he dictated the tempo of a game which was always within the grasp of he and his comrades and they emerged comfortable winners , despite the 1 - 0 scoreline			0
he may not boast the dynamic forward bursts of @entity21 , but there is a discipline about @entity0 which serves as reassurance for manager @entity34			1
@entity0 has made 160 appearances for @entity18 since arriving from @entity1 in 2011 for £ 20million indeed , as @entity93 lined up one 40 - yard free - kick , it was to @entity0 whom @entity34 screamed advising against a shot on goal			1
@entity93 duly crashed an audacious effort into the wall regardless of the instruction , but it was clear who the man on the touchline trusted as his onfield general in the absence of @entity21			0
@entity0 speaks of his soon - to - be - former team - mate in the highest regard			2
he does , though , see himself as the heir apparent at @entity109			0
@entity0 lines up a shot from midfield against his former club on saturday ' there 's only one leader at the moment and that is @entity118 , ' said the @entity120 midfielder			1
' next season with @entity118 going then things may change a little			0
everyone was in shock as he is such a big leader for us			0
he said the time is right so we have to respect that			0
' now , however , you must respect @entity0 as the captain - in - waiting at @entity109			2
on this evidence , he will do a fine job			0
@entity0 high fives outgoing the @entity18 captain during @entity18 's 2 - 1 @entity134 win over @entity135			1

@entity0 is the *obvious* choice for @entity18 's next captain
he captained his side for 45 minutes against former club , @entity1
the @entity120 midfielder is able to dictate play
he is one of manager @entity34 ' most trusted *performers*
