by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 08:58 est , 21 june 2013 most children dream of tucking into a slice of birthday cake , delving into bags of sweets , or scoffing an ice cream on a hot day			0
but for @entity10 the luxury of sweets - and indeed all food - must remain a dream			2
the six - year - old suffers from a rare and incurable condition called eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic colitis which makes him allergic to everything he eats and means he must rely on a drip to provide him with nutrients			1
diagnosed three years ago , @entity10 is unable to eat any food because it aggravates his throat and colon and makes him sick			1
the immune is so rare it affects as few as one in 10,000 people			1
@entity10 is allergic to all food			1
the six - year - old suffers from a rare and incurable condition which affects as few as one in 10,000 people both conditions are caused by the body producing too many of a type of white blood cell in his oesophagus and colon			1
the cells ’ job is to kill bacteria and parasites , but the autoimmune condition causes them to react to foods , which in turn produces toxins and causes inflammation			2
the severity of @entity51 's condition is rare as most sufferers are usually able to find foods they can eat			1
but @entity10 and his family are yet to discover anything which does n’t make him very ill. mother @entity57 , 41 , who lives with @entity10 , his father @entity58 , 42 , and their four other children in @entity61 near @entity62 , is keen to raise awareness of the disease			1
she said : ' @entity10 lives as normal a life as possible but he has his moments			2
' when he ’s with other kids who are eating he feels like it ’s being rubbed in his face			0
he needs to be fed through his drip every three hours			2
smiling through his condition , which sees him unable to eat any food because it aggravates his throat and colon and makes him sick @entity10 , pictured with his mother @entity57 , has to be fed through a drip since he was diagnosed with @entity78 ( eoe ) , an allergic inflammatory condition of the oesophagus ' he talks about wanting to eat all the time			1
we have tried to introduce foods one at a time but so far every one has made him ill. when we tried chicken he was sick for a week			0
' @entity78 is an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus , the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach			2
the condition is caused when a type of white blood cell ( an eosinophil ) builds up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens			1
they attack the foods , rather than allowing them to be ingested			0
as they build up , the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue , causing swallowing problems			0
it can be treated with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods , by taking steroid medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically widening the esophagus			0
@entity78 was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause			0
ms @entity112 has been in and out of @entity113 with @entity10 since the diagnosis , and she is yet to find anybody else in the north - west who suffers with the condition			1
' i ’ve found online help groups but everyone seems to be from down south			0
' i would really love to find families nearby who we can talk to about it			0
' despite his condition , brave @entity10 gets on with life			1
he goes to school , plays on his @entity129 , has a kick - about with his siblings and loves watching @entity132 and @entity133			0
but he ca n’t play football at school because his drip may come out and the joint pain which is a side affect means he often ca n’t sit cross-legged on the floor with the rest of the children			0
@entity57 added : ' we bought a book online for @entity10 ’s teacher to read to his class so his friends could understand the illness better			2
' often when i try to explain people do n’t understand the severity of the condition or what it means for @entity10			1
' @entity10 was always being sick as a baby but doctors said it was just colic until he was diagnosed aged three			2
the @entity158 are holding a fundraiser and awareness day for the @entity161 - at the @entity162 on @entity163 , on july 5 from 7pm			0
there will be entertainment including a dj.			0
