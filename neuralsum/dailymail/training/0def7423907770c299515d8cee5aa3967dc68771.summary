' disbelief : @entity38 gained a huge amount of social media attention after voicing his love of @entity5 ' mid- 1990s work after receiving a number of shocked messages asking why he was so interested in @entity155 films , the @entity1 jihadist sent a message saying : ' they think i grew up somewhere in a mud hut ' change of mind : having earlier declared himself to be a fan of @entity10 , @entity38 later attacked @entity5 after video emerged of him mocking jihadists during a stand - up performance having earlier declared himself to be a fan of @entity10 , ' @entity38 ' appeared to change his mind a short time later after other @entity1 militants posted @entity33 footage of @entity5 mocking jihadists during a stand - up performance			1
in the clip @entity5 jokes that the oft - repeated claim that @entity198 martyrs receive ' 71 dark - haired virgins ' may have been misinterpreted , and they are in fact given ' 72 crystal clear raisins '			2
he also jokes about the late @entity203 leader @entity202 being beaten at the gates of heaven by the first president of the @entity208 @entity207 and 71 virginians			0

' he also mocked claims @entity5 committed suicide , describing it as a ' blessing ' and claiming ' @entity217 guards us from depression			0
@entity223 , what an evil destination			0

' @entity1 militants fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 have reportedly issued islamic state passports as part of their ' psychological warfare ' campaign			2
following their attempt to form a caliphate in the vast area of the @entity246 under their control , @entity1 leaders are said to be introducing passports to give the unrecognised state an air of legitimacy			0
however experts believe the sinister black and white design , which is based on the black jihadist flag flown by @entity1 terrorists and warns of a ' deployment of armies ' if the holder comes to harm while travelling abroad , proved the passports are little more than a symbolic gesture			0
authentic ? @entity1 militants have reportedly issued these @entity263 passports in the hope they will give the unrecognised state an air of legitimacy			2
the documents are said to have been issued to 11,000 people while @entity1 has expressed a desire to expand its territory to include stretches of @entity105 , including @entity106 and @entity107 , and have also threatened to raise the jihadist flag over @entity109 and the @entity110 , the issuing of passports is more about sending a message than transporting fighters			0
issuing state documents is both a clear indication that @entity1 considers its declared caliphate to be the world 's newest state , and also to shrug off the threat posed to its existence by @entity208 airstrikes			0
so far at least two versions of the alleged passport have emerged online			0
although it is not possible to prove the authenticity of either version , the latter has been widely shared on social media by respected terror experts and academics			0
dr @entity294 , a @entity295 academic who regularly briefs senior government and security officials on the threat of @entity198 terrorism , tweeted a photograph of the plastic passport along with the caption : ' illusions of a caliphate			0
