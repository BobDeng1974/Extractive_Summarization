@entity0 has suspended the import and use of an @entity5 @entity4 corn following a study suggesting a link to breast cancer and organ damage			1
separately , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , has ordered its own review in to the research , which was conducted at a @entity14 university			1
the decision by @entity0 could be followed by other nations in what would be a severe blow to the take - up of the controversial technology			2
cancer risk ? a farmer shows two corncobs of genetically engineered corn by @entity5 company @entity25 , right , and two normal corncobs from @entity27 , left historically , biotech companies have proved the safety of @entity4 crops based on trials involving feeding rats for a period of 90 days			1
however , experts at the @entity35 conducted an experiment running for the full lives of rats - two years			1
the findings , which were peer reviewed by independent experts before being published in a respected scientific journal , found raised levels of breast cancer , liver and kidney damage			1
the same trials also found evidence that consumption of minuscule amounts of a commonly used weedkiller , @entity51 , was associated with a raised risk of cancer			1
both the @entity4 corn , which carries the name @entity55 , and @entity51 are the creation of @entity5 biotech company @entity25			1

the decision by the @entity0 to suspend authorisation for the @entity5 gm corn threatens to trigger a transatlantic commercial and diplomatic row @entity0 ’s consumer rights watchdog , @entity68 , said today that it has suspended the import and use of the @entity4 corn			1
@entity72 said the country ’s @entity73 has been asked to assess the validity of the study			0
it has also contacted the @entity78 ’s @entity79 to ask for the @entity81 ’s position on the corn ’s safety			0
consumer scepticism in the @entity85 and @entity86 means @entity4 corn is not on supermarket shelves here , however it is fed to farm animals , including hens , pigs and dairy cows			2
important : in the @entity5 , and much of @entity86 , corn is used to make an array of food products including cornflakes ( picture posed by model ) last week @entity25 said it did not think the @entity14 study would affect its license to export the @entity102 to @entity86 but would wait to hear from @entity10			1
the company said : ‘ based on our initial review , we do not believe the study presents information that would justify any change in @entity10 ’s views on the safety of genetically modified corn products or alter their approval status for genetically modified imports			2
’ the biotech industry and university researchers involved in @entity4 research have mounted a major @entity118 campaign over the last year to win over sceptical consumers			2
in the past week , @entity121 scientists have been lining up to undermine the @entity14 experiments and criticise the way they were conducted			0
however , a number of independent academics have praised the @entity14 team ’s work , describing it as the most thorough and extensive feeding trials involving @entity4 to date			0
@entity129 , the professor of @entity130 , at @entity131 , @entity132 , said the findings relating to eating @entity4 corn were a ‘ surprise ’			2
prof @entity129 , who describes himself as a neutral on @entity4 , said : ‘ the results are significant			0
the experiments are , more or less , the best of their kind to date			0
’ however , he said that it is now important to ensure they are repeated with more animals by independent laboratories to confirm the outcome			0
‘ we are not scaremongering here			0
more research , including a repetition of this particular study are warranted , ’ he said			0
the professor said it will take two to three years to get a definitive answer .			0
