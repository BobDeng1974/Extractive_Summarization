@entity2 and @entity3 could become the first city in the country to offer safe , clean havens for addicts to use illegal drugs under professional supervision without fear of prosecution if the proposal moves forward			1
as part of a series of measures aimed at cutting the harm drugs cause in the @entity28 city , public health leaders have also recommended that more people should be trained to administer a life - saving overdose antidote			1
and drug services for young people should be separated from those for adults to avoid younger users mixing with older , more experienced addicts , the report published today adds			1
the report , from the @entity39 for @entity2 and @entity3 , follows an investigation which examined how services can reduce the devastation caused by drugs			1
a 10 - strong panel of experts from the commission has been looking at the challenges thrown up by illegal drug markets , drug use and the effectiveness of the responses to them			0
real - time data on supply routes and drug - taking trends should be collected so that education , treatment and enforcement can be applied more rapidly , the report also suggests			2
@entity64 , the commission 's vice chairman , said : ' this has been a thorough investigation involving drug users themselves , other people affected by drugs , key agencies and leading experts in @entity2 and @entity3 to try to come up with ideas to minimise the harm that drugs cause the city			1
' although @entity2 and @entity3 has shed its crown as the @entity12 's drugs death capital , substance misuse in the city remains stubbornly high			1
in 2000 , 67 residents died a drug - related death , with the figure now standing at around 20			2
the commission said that more than 2,000 people are considered problem heroin and cocaine users and that more than 60,000 people in the city have used illegal drugs			0
@entity87 , chairman of the city council 's adult care and health committee , said : ' @entity2 and @entity3 has had a problem with drug abuse for decades and we 're determined to do something about it so we take these recommendations very seriously			2
' although @entity2 and @entity3 has shed its crown as the @entity12 's drugs death capital , substance misuse in the city remains high @entity99 , @entity2 and @entity3 's director of public health , said : ' we have a relatively high number of drug users in the city , and in the past we have had high numbers of drug - related deaths			1
' so we welcome these recommendations and will work closely with key partners to make sure that the ideas in the report complement our work on helping people fully recover			0
' we have come a long way from the peak in 2000 when 67 @entity2 and @entity3 residents died from drug use			2
while this has fallen to 20 deaths , each of these still represents a personal tragedy for the person concerned and for families and friends			0
' more than 90 drug consumption rooms have been set up worldwide since the mid 1980s , including in @entity124 , the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			0
they are professionally supervised healthcare facilities where drug users can use substances in safe and hygienic conditions			0
they aim to establish contact with difficult - to - reach users , according to the @entity138			0
but they have proved controversial , with concerns that they may encourage drug use , delay treatment entry and aggravate problems among local drug markets			0
the commission 's report will be considered by the @entity147 on april 30 .			0
