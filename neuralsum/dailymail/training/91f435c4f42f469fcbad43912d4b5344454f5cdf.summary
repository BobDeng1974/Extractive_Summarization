mr @entity4 , who had a one - year - old daughter @entity21 , had turned to the synthetic drug after years of being plagued by insomnia			1
miss @entity18 told the inquest that the father , from @entity26 , @entity27 , ordered the drug online but insisted he was not an addict			1
breaking down in tears , she told the hearing : ' he ordered it from the internet and they delivered it			2
' i just found out about him taking these drugs when i moved in with him ( in 2012 )			2
just lately before he died he said it helped with his sleeping			2
' sometimes he took it , sometimes he did n’t			2
' he was taken to @entity39 , in @entity40 , @entity27 , on august 17 last year but was pronounced dead			1

father : @entity4 , 41 , ( left ) died after taking four times the fatal overdose of the legal drug			1
he was found by his partner @entity18 ( right ) he said : ' this is tragic			1
it seems to me the problem with drugs that are not prescribed by a doctor and obtained through a pharmacist is that you do n’t know what they are doctors frequently prescribe drugs to combat insomnia - but only in the smallest dosages			2
gps will generally only provide drugs when the problem is very severe , and even then only for short periods			0
the reason is anti-insomnia drugs do n't treat the cause of the problem , and a doctor may instead refer the patient to a psychologist to look at other treatments			0
it is very easy to become dependent on sleeping tablets , even when they are only used in the short term			0
patients should always seek advice from a doctor or pharmacist			0
' and perhaps more importantly , you do n’t know how many to take and how regularly to take them before problems occur			0
' i also propose to write to the @entity63 about this case			0
' i ’m aware that obtaining drugs other than via prescription is very easy these days			0
it ’s possible to obtain all sorts of substances via the internet			0
' even though it ’s a big problem , i think it ’s necessary that people like me draw to the attention of the @entity63 what the problems are to see if anything can be done			0
' @entity120 might be given to making it illegal which it is n’t at the moment			0
' the coroner ruled that the death was an accident			0
speaking from the couple ’s home yesterday , miss @entity18 said : ' @entity4 was my world			1
what has happened as devastated us all			0
