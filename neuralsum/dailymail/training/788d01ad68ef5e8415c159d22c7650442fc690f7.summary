' after @entity1 tumbled to the tarmac , @entity75 raced away to win the opening stage of the tour for a second year running			1
@entity1 , who had been bidding for his 26th @entity0 stage win , had ridden gingerly back to the team bus holding his side before being taken away in an ambulance with his wife @entity83 and two - year - old daughter @entity83 following in a team car			1
for @entity1 , it was sad repeat of last year 's opening stage - when @entity89 beat a depleted field after @entity1 and others had been caught in a crash on the run into @entity94			1
crossing the finish line : but @entity1 would n't have wanted it to end this way curse of @entity99 : the prime minister reacts to @entity1 's fall in @entity9 flashpoint : @entity1 and @entity15 come together as they sprint for the finish line down ... and out ? @entity1 shows all the signs of a man whose @entity0 dream could be over ceremony : @entity109 of @entity110 cuts the ribbon before the start of the 190.5km first stage so it begins : the race leaves the start for stage one of the @entity118 from @entity119 to @entity9 @entity121 star : @entity122 's @entity1 is pictured before the ceremony signature prior to the start lining the streets : fans gather at the start of stage one for @entity129 of the 2014 @entity0 and they 're off ! the pack of riders in action during the 1st stage of the 101st edition of the @entity0 good turn out : thousands of cycling fans gather near the stage 1 finish line in @entity137 ' he was very impatient , ' he said			1

' @entity144 came next to him , slowed down , he wanted to get out , and ( @entity1 ) pushed him with his shoulder			2
@entity15 pushed back and , boom , they crashed			2
' a victory for @entity1 would have completed a dream day for @entity122 cycling fans , with @entity137 laying on one of the more spectacular @entity151 of recent years			1
more than a million fans had turned out to line the route of the 190.5km stage , which began with a long preamble from @entity119 to @entity156 before continuing through the @entity157 and over the @entity158 climb into @entity9			1
' it 's an unfortunate way to end what could 've been a dream scenario , ' said @entity164 principal sir @entity163 - @entity1 's former boss			1
' he 's a great champion			0
he 's done an awful lot for his country and we should n't forget that			0

the sprinters ' teams regrouped , though , before @entity1 's crash created chaos			1
@entity89 powered away to the line ahead of @entity214 ( @entity215 ) and @entity216 ( @entity217 ) , adding to his four stage wins from the @entity219			2
after a neutralised ride - out from @entity119 to @entity156 , the @entity221 and @entity27 and prince @entity222 gave the tour a royal send - off			0
the stage was listed as flat , but it was undulating all day in the rolling @entity137 countryside			1
@entity193 @entity227 ( @entity207 ) , the oldest man in the peloton at 42 and in his 17th tour , was in the day 's three - man breakaway and distanced @entity231 ( @entity232 ) and @entity233 ( @entity234 ) on the second categorised climb , the @entity236			0

@entity1 almost failed to finish the stage after late crash
he seperated his acromioclavicular joint as he tumbled 200m from the line
he may not make the start line for day two in @entity137
collision with @entity15 after looking to *overtake* in sprint
and @entity1 admits his fall was his own fault
@entity75 takes the 118 - mile first stage win in @entity9
