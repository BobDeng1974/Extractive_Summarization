it 's a photo that never fails to shock new visitors to an @entity3 pub. a man swallowed by a shark has managed to force his arm through the creature 's gills and is desperately stabbing it			1
presumably still alive inside the shark 's stomach , he is able to plunge the knife into the its head in a desperate fight for survival			2
but all is not as it seems			2
the unnamed fisherman did catch the shark and he did end up in its stomach			2
but first he made sure the shark was very dead before he gutted it and then crawled inside its body to prepare for a prank photo that would be taken by one of his friends			1
the dramatic part came when he then pushed his tattooed arm out through the shark 's gills and pretended to be fighting for his life by stabbing the killer fish in the head			0
locals , said radio host @entity56 of @entity58 's @entity57 , who was sent a copy of the photo , refer to the fisherman as the @entity62			1
' this fellow has decided as a jape to climb inside the shark with a knife , put his hand through the gills of the shark and pretended to stab it between the eyes , ' mr @entity56 told his listeners today			0
open wide ... of course sharks - even ones as big as the great white shark pictured here , are better known for biting large chunks off humans they come across rather than swallowing them whole he then went on to describe the reaction of one pair of visitors			0
' an @entity85 couple have turned up at the @entity30 to see this photo ( on the wall ) and their immediate response from the wife was " did he survive ? " , ' said mr @entity56			1
the fisherman happened to be standing behind the couple at the time			0
although his response is not known , the @entity85 might have had the shock of their lives if he 'd said : ' yes , i did ! '			0

the photo hangs in a hotel in the @entity32 region of @entity33
