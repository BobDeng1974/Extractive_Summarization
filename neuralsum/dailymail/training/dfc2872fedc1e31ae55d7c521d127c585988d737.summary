by @entity0 @entity1 has taken aim at ' indiscreet ' @entity4 's claims that certain @entity6 players during his time at @entity8 tried to find ways of skipping international duty			1
writing on his @entity11 blog , former @entity8 favourite @entity1 said players who ca n't handle the pressure of playing for @entity6 deserved @entity4 's ' protection and discretion '			1
instead @entity4 treated these ' deep psychological fears ' like ' cocktail - party gossip			2
' hitting out : @entity1 has written that @entity4 was ' indiscreet ' in his remarks about @entity6 players who shirked international duty when at @entity8 claims : @entity4 said in an interview there were certain @entity6 players at @entity8 who tried to shirk international duty the @entity29 manager criticised the commitment of young @entity32 players to the national team in an interview with @entity37 's @entity36 programme last week			1
he highlighted experiences of managing @entity6 players while in charge of @entity8 , claiming there were ' two or three ' who did not want to go away with the national team			1
@entity4 recalled : ' they would come to me 10 days before the game and say , ' @entity46 , get me out of that game , i do n't want to play in that game '			0
that was how it was			0
i 'd say , ' you 're playing for your country , you should want to play '			0
' ( they would say ) ' nah , my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks , i do n't want to play ' and that is the truth , so it makes you wonder			0
' shirked responsibility : @entity4 said that when @entity8 manager , two or three @entity6 players would look for excuses to get out of international games when challenged , @entity4 , who was strongly linked with the @entity6 job following the departure of @entity65 , refused to identify the players in question			1
and now @entity1 has condemned @entity4 's remarks , saying the players in question did not deserve such ' vilification			2
' he wrote : ' the revelations made by @entity4 last week , apart from being outrageously indiscreet , touched on this very point			0
' coping with pressure has always been a fundamental part of playing at the highest level			0
pressure point : @entity1 argues that @entity6 players wanting to pull out of fixtures is a sign they have a psychological problem ' however , if certain @entity6 players go to their club manager asking them to be pulled out of an international fixture because they ca n’t cope with the pressure , then they deserve his protection and discretion , not vilification			1
' by a player announcing he ’s not big enough for the occasion in the same way a player might refuse to take a penalty in a shoot - out , it should not to be used in order to sell a few more newspapers or as a baseball bat to take revenge on a player who may have let you down in some capacity in the past			0
' these revelations are deep psychological fears and for a manager to treat them like cocktail - party gossip is appalling			2

@entity4 claimed in @entity37 interview certain @entity6 players tried to skip international duty when he managed @entity8
@entity1 hit back in blog , saying @entity4 was ' indiscreet ' and should have protected players
@entity4 refused to name any of those alluded to
@entity117 added that wanting to miss @entity6 games could be a deep psychological problem
