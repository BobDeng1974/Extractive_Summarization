three @entity1 women have undergone a revolutionary new operation to fit a ' bra ' underneath the skin to combat sagging breasts			1
the ' internal bras ' comprise a fine hardened silicone cup placed under the breast tissue , and fine silk straps screwed into the patient 's ribs to lift the breast			1
they are invisible under the skin and will enable women to go bra-less			2
three women have undergone a revolutionary new breast lift operation at @entity19 's @entity18 's and @entity20			1
the procedure involves a surgeon implanting a silicone cup underneath the skin and screwing fine silk straps into the rib cage to life the breast tissue more importantly , it is claimed they will not leak - welcome news after the recent @entity32 scandal			1
the 45 - minute operations , carried out at @entity19 's @entity18 's and @entity20 , cost £ 6,000 - around £ 1,000 more than standard breast implants			1
leading breast surgeon professor @entity35 carried out the first three trial operations at the hospital last week			1
the procedure is likely to be free to @entity41 patients who have had medical breast reductions and breast cancer patients , and could be routine by next year , @entity38 reports			1
but experts have urged caution , welcoming the new operation while calling for extensive clinical trials to examine the long - term effects on women			1
professor @entity50 of the @entity51 told @entity52 the procedure , which has been in development since 2007 , is an ' exciting ' development			2
but he said it is vital that full trials are carried out to highlight any potential side - effects for patients			1
he said : ' this procedure may prove to be an effective alternative			2
' this procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term ' - professor @entity50 of the @entity51 ' it will have a real impact , i think			1
but people should understand it is not a quick fix			0
' we do n't know the long - term side effects yet			0
there is a need for clinical trials with adequate numbers and follow ups to prove the efficacy and safety in the long term			1
' one of the things to be looked into is if fixing silk straps to the ribs will have side effects			1
' in a standard breast operation the silicone implants are inserted behind the breast to minimise the risk			2
' these cups go under the skin , so the question is do we know the long - term effect to women , will they develop scaring and will the internal bra affect the shape of the breast in the long term ? ' it is premature to say it is a solution to the issue of sagging breasts			1
' he added that the operation may not be suitable for all women with sagging breasts			2
' it has been marketed as a magical solution to address saggy breasts with very little scaring , ' he added			0
experts have welcomed the new operation but called for extensive clinical trials to prove the long - term efficacy and safety of the procedure standard breast uplift surgery involves removing excess skin from underneath a patient 's breast , or from around the area of dark tissue surrounding a woman 's nipple , the areola			1
surgeons tighten the skin and breast tissue , moving the nipple to a higher position to give a firmer appearance			2
breast enlargement or reduction surgery can be carried out at the same time			2
uplift surgery can take two to three hours , depending on the exact procedure			0
it can take around four weeks to make a full recovery , but it can vary depending on the individual patient			0
typical side - effects include soreness , swelling and bruising as well as permanent scars			0
some patients can experience reduced nipple sensation			0
as with all procedures the opertaion comes with warnings of complications , including infection , bleeding under the skin and unevenness in size and shape			0
' but many women with saggy breasts do not just need their breast tissue lifting , they require surgery to address their skin			0
' this procedure can be used alongside standard surgery when the breasts are lifted to reduce the risk of a occurrence of sagging			0
' sagging breasts depends on many factors , a women 's biological constitution , the size of their breasts , their reproductive history and other factors			0
' if a patient has had a proper breast lift and is concerned about the occurrence of sagging , this operation could prove effective			2
' but it is unlikely to be effective on its own			0
it is important that a women has procedures to address the skin as well as the breast tissue itself			0
' professor @entity50 said while the new device has @entity185 marking - which denotes it complies with @entity188 safety , health and environmental requirements - the accreditation only refers to the actual product itself			0
he said : ' ce marking only refers to the safety in the sense of the materials itself , the actual product			0
' but it does not mean the procedure is safe			0
' he said the operation need @entity203 ( @entity204 ) , which looks at the efficacy of the procedure , not just the materials used			1
' yes , this procedure is exciting but we must look at its efficacy and safety in the long term			1
