of all the tales about the @entity2 , it must be one of the most unlikely – an @entity5 plot to kidnap the beast and display its carcass in @entity8			1
but back in the 1930s the @entity9 feared that such a thing was all too possible , according to newly revealed papers , and fought to ensure she stayed north of the border			2
the @entity14 opened a file on @entity2 in december 1933 after being bombarded with inquiries following sightings that year			1
the documents also reveal that many years later prince @entity32 even suggested calling in the @entity33 to search for the creature			1
by 1934 both the @entity24 in @entity8 and the @entity35 in @entity36 wanted @entity2			1
strange spectacle : a report in the @entity39 from may 1933 noted there had been a ' strange spectacle ' on the famous @entity42 and mentions the monster hunted : @entity9 hoped to keep hunters , such as @entity45 , pictured searching for the monster in 1933 , at bay until a law could be brought in to protect the creature but while @entity9 hoped that the bounty hunters could be kept at bay long enough to get new laws passed to protect her , @entity8 preferred her shot on sight			1
in march 1934 an unnamed official at the @entity58 made no bones about how he thought bounty hunters should deal with the creature			0
the files show he said : ‘ should you ever come within range of the “ monster ” i hope you will not be deterred by any humanitarian considerations from shooting him on the spot and sending the carcass to us in cold storage , carriage forward			0
short of this , a flipper , a jaw or a tooth would be very welcome			0
’ royal suggestion : the documents also reveal that many years later prince @entity32 even suggested calling in the @entity33 to search for the creature wanted : in march 1934 an official at the @entity24 in @entity8 said bounty hunters should shoot the monster on the spot and send ' the carcass to us in cold storage , carriage forward ' according to more documents found in @entity36 , pressure was already growing for a special @entity91 to prevent @entity2 being killed or captured			1
the campaign was led by @entity94 mp @entity93 , who assured the @entity9 secretary sir @entity95 the creature was no myth			2
‘ evidence of its presence can be taken as undoubted			0
far too many people have seen something abnormal to question its existence , ’ he wrote			0
he demanded a @entity104 be put before @entity105 to protect the creature , but sir @entity95 advised there was ‘ no law for the protection of monsters ’			0
the @entity35 wrote to sir @entity95 staking @entity36 ’s claim to the carcass			2
‘ the museum urges strongly that the @entity35 have the reversionary rights to the “ monster ” if and when its corpse should become available , ’ the letter said			2
protection : the campaign to protect @entity2 was led by @entity94 mp @entity93 ( left ) , who assured the @entity9 secretary sir @entity95 ( right ) that the creature was no myth ‘ we think the monster should not be allowed to find its last resting place in @entity5			1
such a fate would surely outrage @entity9 nationalism which at the moment is thriving greatly under the monster ’s beneficent influence			0
’ @entity24 files from the 1960s also state that when approached by a @entity132 mp , @entity93 , who was ‘ obsessed ’ with @entity2 , prince @entity32 encouraged him to contact the @entity33 for assistance			1
the revelations are made by author @entity135 in his book @entity138 ’s @entity137			0
he said : ‘ during the 1930s … @entity2 had become a @entity9 icon , a symbol of national identity			2
there was genuine outrage at the possibility that the corpse of the monster might be taken for display in @entity8			0
