@entity5 of @entity7 's bananaskin yesterday came courtesy of a six year old primary school pupil who asked her innocently : ' are you going to be @entity11 ? ' the textbook answer , as far as @entity12 is concerned , would have been ' no , @entity14 ' - which is what they have always insisted she will be called when prince @entity17 accedes to the throne			1
@entity19 is passionate about literature and has long campaigned to get children reading more instead @entity19 laughed and replied mischievously : ' you never know			1
' her response is likely to add to fuel to the fire of constitutional debate over the @entity5 's future role			1
the prince 's advisors plumped for the title on her somewhat controversial marriage to the @entity17 in order to placate public sensibilities			0
academics insist , however , that she will legally be @entity11 whatever @entity17 chooses to call her			0
and friends of the prince say he has always been hopeful that the public would indeed accept her as just that			0
@entity5 was out and about on public duties yesterday to promote her new patronage of national literacy charity , @entity45			1
the organisation recruits and trains volunteers from every walk of life to work in primary schools with children who have fallen behind in their reading			1

yesterday she was at @entity56 's @entity55 in @entity57 , south west @entity58 , to meet some of the children @entity45 has helped			1
as wife of the future king , the @entity60 is undoubtedly an expert on anything royal			0
and yesterday she declared seven - year - old @entity65 ’s kingly outfit as ‘ superbly authentic ’			2
‘ i must say , ’ she said , ‘ you look pretty cool			0
’ of @entity45 , the @entity5 said : ' i find that the more gruesome it is , they more they love it ' whether that ’s a compliment she frequently pays her husband , the @entity17 , is anyone ’s guess – although he was recently named by @entity75 as one of the snappiest dressers in @entity78			1
but @entity19 was certainly very taken with her new young friend , wearing who was wearing a paper crown , cloak and a drawn - on beard			0
she appeared entranced as the pupils treated her to a performance of one of the books they have recently been reading , an @entity85 tale called @entity90 , featuring @entity65 in a starring role			2
she also met several youngsters working with their volunteers , including five - year - old @entity94 , who has come on ‘ leaps and bounds ’ with the help of @entity98			2
after listening to him reading aloud , she said : ‘ @entity100 , that was brilliant			0
i give you ten out of ten			0
everyone is very proud of you			0
’ she also treated some of the children to a rendition of @entity45			1
discussing the story afterwards , particularly the child - eating giant , she said : ‘ i find with children that the more gruesome it is , they more they love it			0
’ @entity5 left the school with three signed copies of the book			2
@entity19 met children who have fallen behind in their reading , but are benefitting from the scheme			1
