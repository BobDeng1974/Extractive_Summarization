a dangerous combination of alcohol and gravity played a cruel joke on a @entity5 artist who fell out of a second - floor window after accidentally breaking into a flower shop while trying to prank a friend			1
@entity9 , 29 , who goes by the moniker @entity10 in @entity13 's art circles , said he was trying to surprise a friend saturday by sneaking into her apartment via the fire escape			1
but unfortunately for @entity17 , who admittedly came up with the stunt after downing a few too many beers , he got the wrong building			2
harebrained prank : @entity9 , 29 , who goes by the moniker @entity10 , was arrested saturday after he accidentally broke into a @entity13 , @entity5 , flower shop thinking it was his friend 's home instead of climbing into the apartment of @entity27 , which she shares with her fiance , @entity17 found himself in the middle of @entity33 's & @entity34 's flower shop on @entity35 saturday night			1
after realizing his mistake , and getting tangled in some plants , the hapless 29 - year - old tripped the alarm and fell from a second - floor window , @entity36 reported			1
when @entity17 came to , he found himself lying on the pavement with a pair of @entity13 police officers staring down at him			2
the artist suffered a broken wrist and was hauled off to jail , but prosecutors have decided to let him off the hook after concluding that he has learned his lesson			0
@entity17 has acknowledged that the nighttime escapade was a ' foolish ' idea , and he now plans to apologize to the owner of the flower shop for the unwelcome visit			1
in an ironic twist , even if @entity17 got the right building that night , his grand gesture would have been in vain because his friend , a fencing referee , was away that week working at an international competition in @entity62			1
ironic : @entity17 was hoping to surprise his friend and former roommate , @entity27 ( left and right ) , but unbeknownst to him she was in @entity62 at the time @entity13 police were dispatched to the flower shop at 584 @entity35 at around 10pm saturday after receiving an alert indicating a possible break - in			1
@entity17 / @entity10 was picked up , literally , and jailed on charges of burglary , criminal mischief and theft			1

they said the 29 - year - old plummeted two stories while trying to use the fire escape as a getaway route			2
the 29 - year - old aspiring tattoo artist said that the ill - conceived stunt was exacerbated by an unfortunate miscalculation on his part , which brought him two buildings down from where his friend @entity86 lives			0
after climbing two flights of fire - escape stairs to the third floor of 584 @entity35 , he snuck into the attic and then descended down to the second floor , where his error became immediately apparent			2
instead of encountering the familiar interior of his friend 's apartment , he saw mannequins used by the florist in window displays			2
@entity17 tried to beat a hasty retreat , but on his way downstairs he tripped the burglar alarm			0
series of unfortunate events : @entity17 climbed the fire escape to the attic at 584 @entity35 in @entity13 , descended to the second floor and only then he realized that he broke into @entity33 's and @entity34 's flower shop two peas in a pod : @entity17 and @entity27 had been roommates at one time , and according to the woman , it is not uncommon for him to hurl pebbles at the windows to draw her attention desperate to escape , @entity17 tried to climb out the window but stumbled and fell , landing on the sidewalk below where he was collared by police			1
mr @entity17 was released from @entity119 monday after spending the weekend cooling his heels in a cell			0
when @entity27 heard of her friend 's misadventure , she was not surprised			0
‘ he ’s always up for a good time			0
sometimes he might lack common sense about some things , ’ she told the paper			0
the fencing referee said it was not uncommon for @entity17 , her former roommate , to hurl stones at their windows to draw her and her fiance 's attention			0
@entity17 insisted that he was not a bad person , but rather a ' foolish young man who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time			0

@entity9 , 29 , who goes by @entity10 , spent the weekend in @entity13 , @entity5 , jail after the stunt
