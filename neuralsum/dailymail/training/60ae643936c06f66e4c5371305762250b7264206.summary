by @entity0 @entity1 took to his bike with fiancee @entity3 ahead of this week 's @entity4			1
the @entity6 racer faces an uphill challenge to end @entity9 's losing streak , which now stretches to 22 races – their worst run since 2004 – on sunday			1
but @entity1 appeared in good spirits taking a ' selfie ' as he and his model partner hit the road on two wheels			2
say cheese : @entity1 was all smiles with fiancee @entity3 ahead of this week 's @entity20 gp @entity1 's compatriot @entity21 meanwhile is hoping @entity22 can finally break their points duck			1
with the team now in their fifth season in the sport , and after 81 races , the @entity26 - based marque have yet to trouble the scorers			0
but the @entity22 cars will be sporting considerable upgrades which @entity21 would like to believe can propel him into the top 10			1
' in the points ? it 's going to be hard , but we 've quite good updates here , so i 'd like to think we 've a better chance than we had in the first few rounds of the year			2
we 've got to hope they work , ' said @entity21			2
thinking man : @entity21 believes @entity22 can target a points finish at this weekend 's race in @entity20 ' our car this year is quite impressive			1
in @entity48 i was following the likes of ( @entity51 ) @entity50 and ( @entity53 ) @entity52			0
through the corners i was not losing a huge loss of time on the overall lap. ' we 've a pretty good car , and these updates should help			0
' the fact @entity61 could closely match a @entity62 and a @entity9 speaks volumes for @entity22 's progress , even if he did finish an additional lap down on the duo come the conclusion			1
' it shows how far we 've come			0
this year we 've made a good step			0
it 's definitely promising , ' added @entity21 , who has finished all 23 races in which he has so far competed			2
' you look at the car now and it looks a lot more impressive than in previous years			0
' with this upgrade , i 'm sure it 's the same amount as the top teams bring to every single race , but for us it is a good step forward			0
' picture perfect : the @entity83 will play host to the fifth round of this year 's championship crucially from @entity21 's personal perspective the 22 - year - old has scored the two 13th places - in @entity90 and @entity91 - that means @entity22 are currently 10th in the constructors ' championship			1
that , in turn , is keeping happy @entity21 's personal sponsors who have helped him acquire his seat with the team			2
' it 's been a good start , not the dream start , but at the end of the day we 're 10th , and that was our aim coming into the season , ' said @entity21			1
' it 's certainly good on my side of the garage because my sponsors like me to do well , and i 've scored the two 13th places which have counted for the team			0
' @entity115 ( team - mate @entity116 ) did it last year , but for me to have finished well twice in four races is all good so far			0
