by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor plans to give motorists a ' grace period ' to park on double yellow lines have been quietly dropped , @entity6 can reveal			0
local government secretary @entity7 said he wanted to save struggling high streets by allowing drivers to park for 15 minutes free of charge			1
but after the plan was torn apart in a public consultation which raised fears it could lead to high streets becoming clogged up and dangerous , mr @entity7 has ditched the idea			1
rocketing parking charges and town centre double yellow lines are forcing families to use out - of - town shopping centres , ministers believe mr @entity7 told the conservative spring forum last year : ' i believe we need to give people the good grace to pop into a local corner shop for 10 minutes , to buy a newspaper or a loaf of bread without risking a £ 70 fine			1
' but a document slipped out by his department reveals public hostility to the proposal			1
businesses and the public were asked by the @entity40 if they supported ' extending grace periods to other areas such as yellow lines and loading bays '			2
but the ' majority of individuals ( 55 per cent ) and organisations ( 73 per cent ) disagreed with this proposal ' , the report says			0
' there were concerns that allowing free periods in places where parking is not permitted ( such as double yellow lines ) , could lead to confusion			2
' the report adds that it could also ' encourage more anti-social and potentially dangerous parking and also lead to sequential parking in some popular areas where kerb space might be continually occupied despite there being a restriction in place '			0
as a result , the government has dropped its plan for double yellow ' grace periods '			2
but it has proposed instead to allow motorists an extra five minutes leeway at the end of free on - street parking , to stop over-strict parking wardens fining families for returning to their cars a few minutes after their time has run out			0
ministers will introduce a ' 10 minute mandatory grace period ' which they claim will mean ' whether motorists pay for their parking , or it is available free for a time , they can have confidence that they will not be penalised for returning a few minutes late '			0
the department will also ' work to extrend the same grace period to local authority off - street parking '			1
@entity90 's shadow local government secretary @entity89 ( left ) said the @entity92 cabinet minister @entity7 ( right ) had been forced to drop his parking plan because it was ' clear that it was never going to work ' @entity90 's shadow communities secretary @entity89 said : ' @entity7 suggested last year that he would allow parking on yellow lines and loading bays			1
' this policy has now been quietly dropped and it ’s clear that it was never going to work			2
' as even he now acknowledges , it would have meant that some spaces would end up being continually occupied			0
' mr @entity7 first proposed a grace period for motorists last year , when he said that parking charges had become ' ridiculously high '			2
several local authorities already allow motorists to park free for up to 30 minutes near local shops , and the @entity109 want to implement similar schemes more widely			1
local @entity66 and high streets minister @entity111 said : ' popping to the shops should be simple and pain free			0
' slapping people with hefty fines is akin to criminalising them but by making ten minute grace periods mandatory we can bring some common sense back to parking on the high street and ease every traffic wardens finger off the ticket trigger			0
' in addition the public will now get a new right to demand a review of where yellow lines are if they do n’t think they are fair or in the right place			0
' these changes are part of range of measures that will give drivers a fairer deal by reining - in over-zealous parking enforcement practices that force drivers to out of town shopping centres			1

@entity7 wanted to help town centres by allowing drivers to park for free
but plan has been binned after it was *rejected* by businesses and public
*u-turn* sneaked out by local government department in blow for @entity151
@entity90 's @entity89 says it was always clear it was never going to work
