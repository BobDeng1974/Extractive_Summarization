one in ten four and five - year - olds in the @entity32 and nearly one in five 10 and 11 - year - olds were classed as obese by the @entity34 in 2010			0

between a quarter and a third of babies are thought to gain weight too quickly in the first six months of life - a risk factor for obesity			0
but health visitors considered this a ‘ sensitive issue ’ which made them ‘ unsure how to intervene without alienating parents ’			1
‘ health visitors felt they had a role in advising parents about diet but did not formally identify and / or intervene with larger infants , ’ the team wrote in the journal @entity53			1
‘ they believed some parents preferred larger infants and were unaware that their feeding practices might be contributing to obesity risk			0
’ children are more likely to be overweight if their mothers were overweight and smoked during pregnancy			0
breastfeeding and late introduction of solid foods reduces the risk but professor @entity35 ’s team found inconsistency in the @entity73 ’s recommendation not to wean a baby until it is six - months - old			0

@entity32 health visitors have a statutory duty to offer a public health service to families with children under five - years - old , including advice about health and nutrition			2
breastfeeding and late introduction of solid foods reduces the risk of obesity but the team found inconsistency in the @entity73 's recommendation not to wean a baby until it is six - months - old however , there is no national guidance on identifying infants at risk of obesity , despite the issue having been highlighted by the @entity151 in 2004 and the @entity152 in 2006			0
@entity153 , professional officer at @entity154 and a registered health visitor , said the government ’s @entity156 2011 - 2015 will help ease the burden on staff , with recruitment of an extra 4,200 health visitors			2
