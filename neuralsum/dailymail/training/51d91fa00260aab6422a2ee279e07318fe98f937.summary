by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 09:32 est , 4 december 2012 while the world – and especially the bookies – enjoy the traditional speculation over the sex and name of any impending royal arrival , the future third in line to the throne has already made royal and constitutional history			1
for he or she will be the first addition to the new - look , non-sexist line of succession which will govern the @entity15 for evermore			1
in short , the @entity16 and @entity16 of @entity17 ’s first - born will trump all subsequent siblings , even if she is a princess who is followed by a string of younger brothers			1
happy couple : @entity23 and @entity24 's baby will be third in line to the throne and has already made royal and constitutional history changes : last year , @entity29 decided that the time had come to tackle the status quo and change the rules of succession last year , @entity29 decided that the time had come to tackle the status quo and change the rules of succession			1
it was never going to be straightforward			1
for any change could even lead to meddling with such fundamental constitutional humdingers as the @entity40			1
and that is not the only reason that mr @entity29 ’s predecessors have flinched from doing anything about this			1
other monarchies have already changed their succession laws			1
in @entity49 , famously , the toddler princess @entity48 was suddenly promoted to @entity48 ahead of her infant brother who had actually been born @entity48			1
but things have always been more complicated in @entity52 because the @entity53 is @entity54 of 15 other countries , from @entity56 to @entity57			2
any change had to require simultaneous unanimity from all of them			2
once @entity24 had made his marriage vows , however , it was clear that this had the potential to become a more pressing issue			2
so , mr @entity29 decided to act while he had the prime ministers of all 16 nations in the room at last year ’s @entity70 summit in @entity71			1
they all signed a ‘ heads of agreement ’ which means that the new system is now acknowledged and already applies de facto			2
however , it still needs to become law ( or become de iure , as lawyers like to say )			2
@entity52 must legislate first so that all the other 15 parliaments can follow suit but @entity83 still needs a document of ‘ formal consent ’ from all 15 individual governments before it can proceed			2
so , the pressure is now on two politicians to get on with it			2
one is @entity90 , the deputy prime minister and the man in charge of the ‘ political and constitutional reform agenda ’			0
he will be responsible for steering a new @entity95 through @entity83			0
the other is @entity97 , the prime minister of @entity98 , who has been charged with rounding up all the necessary ‘ formal consents ’ from the other realms			0
last night , a @entity102 spokesman said that no timetable was in place but mr @entity90 already has the necessary @entity95 drafted and ready for @entity105 as soon as mr @entity97 gives him the go - ahead			1
the process is still fraught with political implications			0
under pressure : the deputy prime minister is in charge of the ' political and constitutional reform agenda ' mps with @entity114 nationalist or republican leanings may see it as a welcome opportunity to enjoy some political mischief and slap down some awkward amendments			0
@entity97 has been charged with rounding up all the necessary ' formal consents ' from the other realms among the peerage , there will , no doubt , be many sisters and daughters of hereditary dukes , marquesses , earls , viscounts and barons who feel that the time has come to amend the inherent sexism in @entity52 ’s aristocracy			1
the loudest complaints , however , will come from those who point out that the @entity52 laws of succession continue to discriminate on religious grounds because the monarch is barred both from being a @entity141 – although the new rules will allow him or her to marry one			0
it is at that point that ancient legislation like the @entity40 could be examined			0
in the past ten years , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 have all attempted to introduce @entity152 ’ @entity153 to change this aspect of the succession ; the most recent was last year			0
it seems likely that some mps will want , at the very least , to extract a commitment from the government to end what they regard as all sectarianism at the heart of the @entity52 constitution			0
mr @entity90 has his work cut out			0
@entity53 , as ever , will abide by the will of @entity105			0
meanwhile , there are other priorities for the duke and duchess – and the unborn hrh prince or @entity172 of @entity17			0
such as : when are the builders going to finish their new married quarters at @entity175 ?			0

the @entity16 and @entity23 ’s first - born will trump subsequent siblings - even if she is a girl and they are boys
