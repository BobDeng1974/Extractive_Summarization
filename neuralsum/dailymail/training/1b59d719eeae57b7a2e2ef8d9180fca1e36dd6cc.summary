the @entity0 asked if it was true that @entity2 was really found buried under a car park			0
a 3d model of the king is pictured @entity2 is to make history by becoming not only the last @entity8 king to die in battle , but also the first to have his genetic code sequenced			1
scientists want to map the king ’s dna before his remains , and any samples taken from them , are reinterred			1
they hope the work will reveal information about the dead monarch ’s hair and eye colour and shed light on his ancestry and links to people living today			1
researchers are also hoping the sequencing will provide more details about the king 's susceptibility to diseases such as @entity31 's and diabetes			1
experts have already learned that besides being a hunchback , the king was badly infected with roundworm , a once common parasite in the @entity38			2
a battle - scarred skeleton with a twisted spine was unearthed by archaeologists in a @entity43 car park last year			0
it was later identified as that of @entity2 dr @entity46 , from the @entity47 , who is leading the gene sequencing project , said : ' it is an extremely rare occurrence that archaeologists are involved in the excavation of a known individual , let alone a king of @entity8			2
' at the same time we are in the midst of a new age of genetic research , with the ability to sequence entire genomes from ancient individuals and with them , those of pathogens that may have caused infectious disease			0
' sequencing the genome of @entity2 is a hugely important project that will help to teach us not only about him , but [ stir up ] discussion about how our dna informs our sense of identity , our past and our future			1
' a battle - scarred skeleton with a twisted spine , pictured , was unearthed by archaeologists in a @entity43 car park in 2012			0
it was later identified as that of @entity2 scientists will also sequence the genome of one of the king ’s confirmed living relatives , @entity81			1
the @entity85 - born cabinet maker , from @entity86 , is a descendant of @entity2 ’s sister , @entity87			2
only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before , and none with @entity2 ’s noble pedigree			1
they include @entity95 the iceman , whose mummified 3,000 - year - old remains were found in the @entity98 in 1991 , as well as various @entity99 , a @entity101 - an early human from @entity103 - a @entity102 and a @entity105 hunter - gatherer			2
@entity2 was born on in 1452 at @entity106 in @entity107			0
during the @entity109 , @entity2 's father , @entity110 , @entity111 was killed and in 1470 , @entity2 and his brother @entity108 were exiled when @entity112 , from the rival house of @entity114 , took back the throne			0
@entity112 's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year , @entity108 became king			2
in 1483 , @entity108 died and @entity2 was named as protector of the realm for @entity108 's son and successor , the 12 - year - old @entity108 @entity108 and his brother @entity2 were placed in the @entity124 and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king 's marriage to @entity129 , the princes were declared illegitimate			0
@entity2 took to the throne the following day			0
he was crowned in july and in august that year , the two princes disappeared , rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign			0
in 1485 , @entity136 , @entity137 launched an attack on @entity2 on @entity139 in @entity140			0
many of @entity2 's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle			0
@entity136 took the throne as @entity136 it has been confirmed that @entity2 had a curvature of the spine , although rumours of a withered arm have n't been verfied form the bones found in the @entity43 car park last year			0
last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite ’s eggs in soil taken from @entity2 ’s pelvic region			1
the find suggests that the king ’s intestines were infected with roundworm during his life			1
advanced techniques may make it possible to detect dna from other organisms , including infectious bacteria , in the samples taken from @entity2 ’s bones			1
whole genome sequencing of @entity95 ’s remains , for example , revealed evidence of the first known human lyme disease infection			1
results from the analysis of @entity2 's bones will be made available to historians , scientists , and interested members of the public			0
only a very small number of select individuals from history have had their genetic codes sequenced before , and none with @entity2 's noble pedigree			0
they include @entity95 the iceman , pictured , whose mummified 3,000 - year - old remains were found in the @entity98 in 1991 dr @entity192 , head of medical humanities at the @entity194 , which is part - funding the research , said : ' by making this genome available to all , we will ensure that we can continue to learn about @entity2 ’s past - both personal and historic - even once his remains have been interred			1
' scientists made the roundworm discovery after finding large numbers of the parasite ’s eggs in soil taken from @entity2 ’s pelvic region			2
the find suggests that the king ’s intestines were riddled with roundworm during his life .			1

scientists want to map the king ’s dna before his remains are reinterred
they hope it will shed light on his ancestry and his links to living people
it could also provide detail about his susceptibility to diseases
genome of the king ’s living relative , @entity81 , will also be sequenced
