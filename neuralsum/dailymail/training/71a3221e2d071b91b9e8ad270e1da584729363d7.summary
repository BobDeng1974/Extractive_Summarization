@entity0 had hardly stepped off court after her stunning triumph at @entity3 10 years ago when the phone of her long - time agent and business mentor @entity5 started ringing off the hook			1
a star was born , one with a golden combination			2
talented , articulate , driven and extremely photogenic — small wonder that the queue of potential sponsors equalled the line of those seeking her autograph			2
@entity5 recalls how they took a hard - headed view : ‘ after she won @entity3 , her life changed			1
we were offered everything going but we did n’t want @entity0 to end up like @entity23			1
@entity0 , while curiously not having added to her @entity3 tally , is still winning @entity37 titles but has also acquired riches beyond most athletes ’ dreams			1
@entity23 , meanwhile , is largely forgotten			2
only two weeks ago , @entity0 was posing with her second @entity42 title in front of the @entity44			1
she couples this with topping the @entity47 list of highest earning female athletes			2
the 27 - year - old @entity50 ’s net worth is estimated at $ 150million ( £ 88m ) and her annual earnings at around $ 27m ( £ 15.9m )			1
her dual success on and off the court is a phenomenon			2
as @entity0 admits , she had little idea what that 2004 triumph at the @entity57 would bring			1
‘ at 17 you ’re not too business - savvy , ’ she tells me in her calm , matter - of - fact way			1
‘ my parents helped me and their support and understanding kept me realistic			2
‘ i lived in a very real world			2
i had just won @entity3 but you go back to @entity68 and the barista is still making the coffee			1
one of the reasons i have been able to keep that success and carry on with all the things i do is that i love going on the court and love competing			0
‘ but i also have opportunities to do things that make me happy			0
if you do n’t have that passion you are never going to be really successful			0
things are always going to be a drag and pull you in so many directions when you are a 17 - year - old who has won @entity3			1
’ largely forgotten : @entity0 's manager did n't want her going the same way as @entity23 @entity86 fancy : @entity0 has won five @entity37 including the @entity87 ( above ) @entity5 played tennis on the @entity90 college circuit and graduated to become the manager of @entity93 ’s junior talent programme			1
‘ i saw her play for the first time at @entity96 ( @entity98 ’s academy ) , aged nine , ’ he says			0
‘ it was like when you look at that video of the young @entity102			0
she practised non-stop for an hour and a half and did n’t even drink any water			0
’ he remains her manager and has helped her launch @entity106 , her own sweets ( @entity0 responds to questions about whether she should be promoting sugar products with the same disdain that meets inquiries about whether the yelp she lets out when hitting the ball is an attractive trait )			1
‘ for the last four to five years she has wanted to own something herself , ’ says @entity5 of the burgeoning @entity117 project			0
‘ we talked to a guy called @entity121 who owns a successful candy business			1
he kind of blurted out ‘ @entity117 ’ over dinner one night			0
‘ @entity0 is great at compartmentalising the tennis stuff and all the stuff off the court			1
she is going to be very successful in business when she is done playing			1
when she has 300 days per year to devote to it , it will be good , and she is putting all the foundations in			2
’ eye of the tiger : while the @entity50 enjoys business opportunities , nothing rivals competing on the court sweet tooth : business savvy @entity0 has recntly branched out with her own line of confectionery asked when that day might come , he replies : ‘ about four or five years , it could be less			1
’ @entity0 has suffered injuries and gone through dips in form			1
yet her love of competing sees her address her on - court career with an ability to shut out distractions			2
@entity5 makes an interesting observation about how she maintains such focus : ‘ most of her friends are not in tennis			0
some players meet someone for the first time and the next thing you know they are in their player box			0
but in there you want people who have been working with you in the trenches			0
she is firm about that			0
’ it was notable in @entity169 that @entity0 ’s entourage amounted to three , no more than when she won @entity3 10 years ago			1
her first time at @entity172 was in 2002 , when she lost the @entity3 junior final : ‘ i remember the junior final was on the sunday , after the men had finished			1
i was one of the last people leaving and it was quite late and nearly dark , a bit eerie			0
trappings of fame : @entity0 is collected for the @entity181 party by @entity183 driver @entity182 in a @entity184 love match : @entity0 is going out with fellow tennis professional @entity186 ‘ i was driving away and thinking how special it is			1
i was upset because i ’d lost and i was thinking about the match , but i looked back and thought , “ how beautiful is this ” , and that i could n’t wait to be back and i ’d really like to win it			2
‘ in 2004 it was a bit of a mess because our housing situation did n’t work out , ’ she recalls			1
‘ we ended up staying with a family with three young kids			0
there were a lot of 6am wake - up calls from the kids			2
i still wonder how i coped and the morning after the final just holding my replica trophy with them in their garden like it was no big deal			0
‘ the final was surreal , something that as a young player you think of as the @entity210 of tennis			0
i had horse blinders on , i did n’t think about anything			0
that ’s why i was fearless			0
i took it as if i was playing on court no 20 , although i was on @entity216 in front of thousands of people playing for the championship			0
no fear : @entity0 remembers playing without worry when she won @entity3 in 2004 early shower : @entity0 crashed out in the second round of the @entity224 last year ‘ i ’d got to the quarter - finals a couple of weeks before in @entity169 and that was a thrill for me			1
and with every match at @entity3 i felt i was playing better			1
i remember the match against ( @entity230 ) @entity229 was one of my best			0
i got that form and did n’t let it drop			0
‘ playing @entity234 in the final , it had been an accomplishment getting there , and i just went with it			0
’ it is a surprise to her that she has not won again at the @entity57 , but twice in @entity169 on clay to add to @entity90 and @entity242 titles , which for years her movement looked so unsuited for			2
it seems hard to believe that it was all 10 summers ago			0
‘ if somebody had asked me then if i would win all four slams and be no 1 , i do n’t think i would believe it , because you almost believe at 17 that everything is such big luck , ’ she says			1
‘ but here i am			0
