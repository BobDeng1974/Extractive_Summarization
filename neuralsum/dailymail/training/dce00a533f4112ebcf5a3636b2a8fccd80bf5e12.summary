by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 20 september 2012 sea change : less people are getting married and having children in @entity4 as people would rather just live together @entity4 family life has changed for good as people are now just as likely to live together and have a baby as they are to get married			1
cohabiting is no longer the ' trial run ' it was for most couples , as for the first time the number of married couples with children equals those in the same situation who refuse to tie the knot			1
last year 38 per cent of cohabiting couples were parents , exactly the same ratio as married couples with children			1
it proves far fewer @entity4 now believe the traditional view that children should be brought up in a home with married parents , despite evidence clearly showing that many more married couples stay together when compared to unmarried ones			1
experts at @entity33 , working for @entity31 , found the number of married couples with children at home has crashed by 320,000 in the last decade			1
the report , using data from the @entity38 , also shows that unmarried couples in the same situation went up by 290,000 in the same period - up a third			1
the number of lone parent families has also rocketed - up more than 200,000 in ten years			0
@entity43 , director of family law at @entity45 , said : ' there are all sorts of different reasons why people cohabit but one of the important aspects of this report is that it shows how socially acceptable it is as a way of forming a family			2
' that was always a taboo in days gone by – you might live together , or ‘ live in sin ’ as a precursor to marriage but what the research now shows is that for the majority of people it is fine if people chose together and have children			0
' for me as a lawyer the big issue here is that despite that level of acceptance , people still labour under the complete misunderstanding that if you are in an unmarried family the law is going to protect you			0
' ' cohabitation is not just seen as a " trial run " before marriage and children , but , for an increasing number of people , as a replacement for marriage as a setting for both long - term relationships and the raising of children , ' the report says			1
although married couples are still in the majority , just over one in three cohabiting pairs now have children , exactly the same number as those who are married			1
@entity92 lives with her partner , @entity93			0
they got together in may 2009 and had a daughter , @entity95 , in may 2012			0
' having been through a long term relationship which did n’t work but we tried to make work by planning a wedding , i am much more relaxed with @entity93			0
our relationship just feels right , so i do n’t feel that i need to be married , ' she said			0
' it ’s not that i am against marriage and , in fact , @entity93 and i probably will get married , not least as i want the same surname as @entity95			0
however , i definitely did n’t feel that i needed us to be married in order to have a child			0
' a poll in the report by @entity111 also found that only a quarter of people interviews believe they should be married before having a child			2
but more than half thought it was more important to be in a ' committed relationship ' - showing that living together is now seen as much more practical			2
by contrast 53 per cent thought it was not important provided the parents were in ' a committed relationship ' while a combined 42 per cent said they had no desire ever to get married or would do it simply to reduce the cost of living .			2

for the first time unmarried couples with children are now at the same level as married couples in the same situation
@entity4 report finds living together no longer a ' trial run ' for marriage and children
this is despite *official* figures still showing that married couples are much more likely to stay together
survey finds at least half of people think a *strong* relationship when having a child is more important than being married
