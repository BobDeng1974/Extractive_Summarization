by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:18 pm on 24th february 2012 a young boy must survive on a simple diet of chicken and chips and fruit salad , after he was diagnosed with a rare allergic condition			1
six - year - old @entity8 baffled doctors and consultants with a series of mysterious health problems , which left his parents @entity14 and @entity15 constantly frustrated and disappointed by the lack of a diagnosis			1
his stomach was often swollen , his skin dry and he has suffered bleeding from his bowel and constipation			0
limiting : @entity8 , 6 , with some of the few foods he can actually eat he collapsed because of breathing difficulties and at times his skin was so dry it looked like he had been slashed by a knife and was so painful he would wake up ten times a night			1
after years of tests , experts at @entity27 have now made a breakthrough			0
following a series of biopsies , they have diagnosed @entity8 with the rare condition , @entity33 ( @entity34 )			2
the condition affects just 700 people in the @entity37			0
the condition , when high levels of white blood cells involved in allergic reactions are present in the body , restricts @entity8 ’s diet to just nine foods - cereal , chicken , ham , pears , apples , bananas , carrots , potatoes and rice			1
if he eats something different , his stomach will swell and his skin will become so dry it will crack and bleed			0
@entity8 of @entity55 , @entity56 also has analyphatic asthma , triggered by the condition , and has to take medication and have cream rubbed into his skin every day			2
baffled : @entity8 with his parents @entity14 and @entity63 , who are relieved they finally have a diagnosis last june doctors restricted him to a no food diet , with just special baby milk , @entity68 , for 21 days			1
@entity15 said : ' it was a horrendous time			0
we caught him trying to lick crumbs off the table , he was so hungry			0
' explaining to him we were only trying to make him better was so difficult			0
' there were lots of tears and he kept telling us we could not starve him because he was only a five - year - old boy			1
' as a baby , @entity8 was very agitated and he could not have normal baby milk and much of his life has been spent in hospital			1
@entity8 ’s health has put a huge strain on @entity14 , 49 , and @entity15 , 43 , and the couple have given up careers in the police and the @entity85 to care for him , as he needs lots of time off school			2
@entity15 , who has formed a support group to help other parents of children with severe food allergies , said : “ it has been very difficult			0
' @entity14 would say there was nothing wrong and i wondered if i was being an over anxious parent but my overwhelming feeling was there was more to it - i knew @entity8 ’s health problems were not normal			1
' @entity8 also has analyphatic asthma although the diagnosis has given the family some direction , it has created other problems for @entity8			2
@entity15 said @entity8 was already fed up with his restricted diet and chips were one of the only things he was happy to eat			1
' there are some things he wo n’t eat because he is so fed with them , like chicken and rice			1
' i deliberately keep certain foods out of the house to avoid tempting			0
' @entity8 but it ’s very hard on him , especially when he has to sit and watch his friends have their lunch at school , when he can only eat certain things			2
' @entity15 said the family was very conscious about eating around @entity8 and her 13 - year - old son , @entity124 , has to eat sweets and chocolate in his bedroom , out of @entity8 ’s sight			1
although @entity14 and @entity15 hope to introduce more foods into @entity8 ’s diet , it is likely he will have to stay on his present diet forever , unless a cure is found			1
@entity15 , a former nursing auxiliary on cardiac investigations at @entity135 , @entity136 , is in regular contact with consultants at @entity27 , which is at the forefront of @entity34 research			0
she takes @entity8 to the asthma and allergy department at @entity135 ’s and he is advised by dietician , @entity145			2
@entity14 , who was a police officer for 15 years but now runs two businesses from home , @entity148 and children ’s party specialists , @entity151 , said : ' he is an active , excitable , loving and humorous five year old			0
' it ’s heart rending when you see him go to eat something he should n’t , then bring it back and ask us if it will make him poorly			0
' it is getting harder as he gets older			0

@entity8 can only eat nine foods : cereal , chicken , ham , pears , apples , bananas , carrots , potatoes and rice
