@entity11 announced the new tv series based on the @entity3 exclusive 's sci - fi action series			2
a 2013 release was also confirmed , though no exact date was given			0
rumours suggest that the company could introduce single - code activations for games that would effectively lock games to this new console			1
this means gamers will no longer be able to lend second - hand games to friends , trade them in , or sell them on			1
scroll down to video coming to television : the @entity9 of games is one of @entity3 's biggest exclusive franchises , and will now be turned into a tv series according to research by @entity35 75 % of gamers will upgrade to the @entity3 56 % of users are hoping the new console has @entity38			2
the study also found that one in four gamers are hoping @entity2 will launch the @entity42 feature following the uncertainty surrounding whether the projection capability will be linked to the new console			1
earlier this year , @entity2 limited the use and sharing of @entity48 codes in a similar way , but later back tracked after customer complaints			0
other rumours around tonight 's event in @entity53 include the addition of a faster processor , improved speech recognition , @entity57 built - in , @entity58 , @entity42 and more			1
there are even rumours circulating that @entity2 may announce two new models - one high - specification model and another cheap , lower - specification model			2
when the @entity64 was announced eight years ago , @entity2 also launched an update to its @entity67 service to allow users to download games and get more features when playing other online players			2
tonight 's announcement is likely to include a similar update , which include the reports that @entity2 may soon introduce code activations for games			1
@entity2 may be heading towards a digital - only model with these plans in which the disc is used for activation only , and all the game content is then accessed online			0
consequently , @entity2 is expected to put a greater focus on cloud gaming			0
hardware-wise , @entity2 may unveil an updated version of its motion - sensing technology @entity85 at tonight 's event with a 1,920x1,080 sensor , which will come with the console			1
the console is expected to have an eight - core cpu from @entity91			1
a blu - ray drive also seems likely , as well as usb 3.0 connections and a @entity95 hard drive			0
although @entity2 is set to unveil its latest version of its @entity98 at an event in @entity53 , @entity6 tonight , it may save some announcements for the @entity102 conference in @entity103 , in june			1
@entity2 has already hinted that its @entity42 system , which can project images from your @entity3 screen around your living room , will be unveiled at the conference @entity2 's @entity58 technology acts as a second screen for the @entity64			2
an updated version of the technology is expected to be announced at tonight 's launch event @entity2 officially bought video - calling software @entity57 in october 2011 , and replaced its @entity116 with the software earlier this year			1
it 's therefore expected that @entity57 will be heavily integrated into the new xbox console , too			2
the new console is also said to have improved voice recognition , with more of a focus on ' natural interaction and context ' , according to reports on @entity125			1
the @entity125 add that users will be able to automatically resume video content where it left off , and the new @entity3 will have speech - to - text functions			0
@entity130 released a video in january showcasing its @entity42 technology - a system that projects images and lights from whatever game or film you 're watching around your living room			1
it was described by @entity2 as : ' designed to push the boundary of living room immersive entertainment by blending our virtual and physical worlds with projected visualisations ' and was dubbed a real - life ' holodeck ' , making reference to the @entity148 technology			0
many @entity3 users are hoping this technology will be announced at the @entity3 event tonight , but it 's more likely to be announced officially at this year 's @entity102 ( @entity102 ) conference in @entity103 , in june			0
this suggests it wo n't be included with the new console , but may feature in updates or future models			0
@entity2 is expected to launch the next - generation of this motion - sensing technology , including a new sensor , games , and improved performance at a launch event in @entity6 tonight			1
the sensor will be shipped with the new xbox console , which is due to go on sale at the end of the year and is expected to be called @entity3 why would @entity2 want to prevent second - hand sales ? because it costs them money			1
console manufacturers take a slice of the revenue of every game sold for use on their machine			0
but if gamers sell - on their games , or part exchange them , the developers and console manufacturers do n't get anything from each subsequent sale			1
so is this rumour bad news for gamers ? not necessarily			0
many will bemoan not being able to cash in old games			0
but if more people are buying games , the cost of games could come down			0
most games normally sell for Â £ 40 when first released - though the second - hand market quickly drives the price down			1
but , possibly more importantly , it could see an end to various unpopular methods developers have employed to discourage trading in games			0
this has included selling part of the game as additional content ( often referred to as @entity202 ) to gamers who do n't own first - hand copies			0
it has also seen many ' single - player ' games have ' multi-player ' elements added to them , so gamers can keep on playing the game against friends instead of trading it in			1
this has not always been popular , as many gamers feel the quality of the original game is watered down to ' crowbar in ' features they do n't want			0
@entity2 may also push its @entity58 technology more with its new xbox			0
the technology acts as a ' second screen ' that lets you currently control your @entity64 console with your phone or tablet			0
only a few games support the @entity58 system at the moment but @entity2 may make it more widely used across its surface tablets , as well as @entity234 and @entity235 devices with the launch of the new xbox console			2
@entity2 is expected to launch the console by the ' holiday season ' , around november or december			2
this year the console is also expected to cost around $ 299 in the @entity240 , and Â £ 299 in the @entity241			2
official release dates and prices should be announced at tonight 's event			0
last november @entity245 launched the @entity246 , the successor to the popular @entity246 system featuring an innovative tablet - like controller			0
@entity245 said it sold just 3.45 million units by the end of march , well below expectations			0
@entity2 will likely take aim at @entity245 , as well as @entity255 , during tonight 's unveiling at its headquarters in @entity53			2
@entity255 was first to showcase plans for its upcoming @entity261 - but not the actual box - at an event in @entity260 last february			1
the reaction to that console , which featured richer graphics and more social features , was mixed			0
a new trailer for the @entity261 was released yesterday			1
many of the rumoured @entity98 720 specifications are said to be similar to those expected with the @entity261			1
video : it 's coming ... watch the @entity261 teaser trailer video : the real - life ' holodeck ' illumiroom by @entity2			1

the company is expected to introduce single - code activations for games effectively locking them to one console
