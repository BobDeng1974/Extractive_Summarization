in fact , they are students at a leading @entity13 university , where undergraduates as young as 17 are taking part in the ‘ sport ’			1
dozens participated in the show , which was open to the public as well as students , and all paid a £ 5 entry fee			2
organisers say pole - dancing – once seen exclusively as a feature of strip bars – is increasingly popular among female students			1
about 170 students are now members of a @entity5 society dedicated to promoting the activity			1
but last night the disclosure fuelled concern about the growing ‘ sexualisation ’ of teenage girls and young women on university campuses , while organisers admitted some parents had voiced concern			1
@entity40 , of the @entity42 evangelical group @entity41 , said : ‘ this is not what parents would expect their daughters to be doing at university			2
‘ those who fought for the right of women to go to university would be appalled by this club			0
‘ the pornification of our culture is forcing young women to do things many of them later regret			1
it ’s yet more evidence of our hyper - sexualised society			1
participant @entity65 is pictured wednesday night ’s show at @entity5 students ’ union , entitled @entity69 , was billed as a showcase of pole - dancing routines			1
the dancers performed to an audience of around 50 , mainly made up of other students , though any member of the public was able to come and watch			0
a total of 62 students were involved in the show – 59 female and , perhaps surprisingly , three male , all between the ages of 17 and 28			2
it involved a series of routines on four poles – most were danced in groups but there were eight solo performances			0
the outfits varied from cut - away backless leotards , to a gold bikini - style top and pants			0
display : @entity96 , left , and @entity97 , right , showed off their dancing skills to the audience on stage : the dancers claim their activity is an art form as well as excellent exercise performance : dozens participated in the show , which was open to the public as well as students , and all paid a £ 5 entry fee in a routine entitled the swinging 1960s , dancers wore small pink hot - pants and a see - through top with a pink bra underneath and performed moves such as doing the splits in the air whilst wrapped around the pole			1
in another routine , @entity123 , nursing students stripped off togas and performed in black and gold pants and cropped tops			0
the pole - dancing revelations come after a @entity129 brought notoriety to @entity131 earlier this month , after footage of two revellers engaged in an intimate act was posted on the internet			1
female students in @entity131 have also taken explicit images of themselves and uploaded them on to @entity138			0
some are naked from the waist up , their modesty barely protected by a bar bearing the words ‘ @entity144 ’ , the name of the @entity147 - based events company that organises themed student parties at @entity131 nightclubs			0
meanwhile , earlier this week , it emerged a website is offering cash - strapped female students at @entity13 universities the chance to link up with ‘ sugar daddies ’ – strangers who will help to cover their university costs			2
medical student @entity4 , 28 , president of the @entity5 , rejected claims of ‘ sexualisation ’ but admitted some parents had concerns			2
she said : ‘ people really enjoy it , as it is a great sport that can be for everyone			2
it is fantastic for your fitness , which is why we have so many students who come along			0
‘ we run classes for all abilities and it is amazing to see what a confidence boost it gives people			0
‘ we had girls performing in the show who have never done anything like this before , but doing this has given them the confidence to get up on stage			0
‘ as a society , we also compete professionally in the sport and some of us have competed in the @entity42 professional @entity187			2
' the university has been really supportive of us since we began and we try to keep away from the stigma that is attached to pole exercise			0
together : @entity192 and @entity97 are pictured at wednesday night 's show at @entity5 technical : about 170 students are now members of a university society dedicated to promoting the activity ‘ for us , it is a great physical workout that is a lot of fun and we ’ve really established ourselves firmly as a sports club on campus			1
' people really enjoy it , as it is a great sport that can be for everyone ' @entity4 , 28 , president of the @entity5 ‘ we have had problems with parents who are unhappy with it but we always encourage them to come along to a class and show them what our sport is about			1
’ @entity211 , of the @entity212 , said it was wrong for the students ’ union to allow ‘ an activity with such dubious associations ’ to take place on its premises			0
he added : ‘ it is certainly not something that most parents would want their daughters engaging in at university			0
