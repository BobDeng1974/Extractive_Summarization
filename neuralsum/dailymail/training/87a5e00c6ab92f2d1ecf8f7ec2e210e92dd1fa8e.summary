an electronic gadget that alerts insurance firms of people 's driving habits could be used by hackers to control the car , it has been claimed			1
experts say the snapshot , which @entity9 has used in more than two million vehicles since 2008 , is simple to hack			1
by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking , a security expert has claimed			1
the @entity17 ( right ) simply plugs into a car 's diagnostic port - but contains virtually no security measures , a leading expert has claimed			0
a snapshot user manages to work out how the gadget communicates with the car , and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car 's @entity32 bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other			1
the @entity17 connects to the car via this system , and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking			1
@entity39 , who works as a security expert at consultancy firm @entity41 , reverse engineered the software included on the snapshot and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car 's @entity32 bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other			1
the @entity17 connects to the car via this system , and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking			1
' the firmware running on the dongle is minimal and insecure , ' he told @entity56			0
' it does no validation or signing of firmware updates , no secure boot , no cellular authentication , no secure communications or encryption , no data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies â€¦ basically it uses no security technologies whatsoever			0
' @entity39 said the results could be disastrous			0
' a skilled attacker could almost certainly compromise such dongles to gain remote control of a vehicle , or even an entire fleet of vehicles			2
' once compromised , the consequences range from privacy data loss to life and limb			0
@entity9 hit out at the claims , and the way they were revealed - the flaw was presented last week at the @entity83 hacking conference in @entity84			1
' if an individual has credible evidence of a potential vulnerability related to our device , we would prefer that the person would first disclose that potential vulnerability to use so that we could evaluate it and , if necessary , correct it before the vulnerability could be exploited , ' the company told @entity56			0
the gadget is plugged into the car 's diagnostic port - and sends information to insurance firms			0
' while it 's unfortunate that mr. @entity39 did n't share his findings with us privately in advance , we would welcome his confidential and detailed input so that we can properly evaluate his claims			0
' @entity39 reportedly contacted the manufacturer of the snapshot device , @entity107 , to inform it of the security vulnerability , but heard no response			2
@entity9 says on its website that @entity17 ' notes information like the distance , time of day and how you drive , including any hard brakes			1
' snapshot personalises your insurance rate based on your actual driving			2
' the better you drive , the more you can save			0
' @entity119 , principal security researcher at @entity120 , warned ' this is just another example of how , as our cars become increasingly connected , we open the door to threats that have long existed in the pc and smartphone world			0
' as well as gaining remote access to the vehicle , by compromising usb dongles cybercriminals could potentially exploit features such as self - parking , active lane control , pre-collision systems and adaptive cruise control , all of which require some level of communication between a sensor and the brakes , acceleration or steering , usually over @entity146 or some other radio signal			2
' as vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous , we can only expect to see more attacks of this nature			2
