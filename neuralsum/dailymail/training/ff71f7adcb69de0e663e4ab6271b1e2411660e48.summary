it 's a death ray on wheels			0
the @entity2 has successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football - sized mortar rounds			1
the truck - mounted weapon , known as the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like			1
using an invisible laser beam to exact targets , the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even misiles			1
the @entity2 tested its @entity9 laser at the @entity21 in @entity22 for nearly six weeks starting in mid-november , @entity19 reported			1
during the tests a ' quarter - sized ' invisible laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones			1
@entity38 , the project manager for the laser program , told @entity19 the test results were ' above and beyond ' what they had expected going into the testing			2
' we had no thoughts that this 10 - kilowatt would be as successful n doing that as it has been , ' he said			2
mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances			0
light speed : this artist 's impression shows how the team behind the new weapon imagine it will work in practice the mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each			2
the laser ’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years			0
@entity2 video of the laser tests shows the laser targeting the mortar so that it burns up in mid-air and does not explode when it completes its trajectory			1
' we turn it into a rock , basically , ' said @entity38			0
large test drones flying five kilometers from the laser system came to crash into the @entity22 desert by aiming the laser at the tail of the unmanned aircraft			1
an infrared camera on the video captured how a small dot of light on the tail slowly grew in intensity , forcing the craft to lose navigational control			0
the laser can also be used for less offensive purposes by dialing back its intensity to blind sensors aboard the drones			2
plans call for shrinking the size of the laser system while also boosting its strength to 50 kilowatts , and ultimately 100 kilowatts			0
shrinking its size will make it easier to mount on more mobile vehicles that can be used on the battlefield			0
increasing the wattage will allow the beam to hit faster - moving targets at greater distances and in a shorter amount of time			0
for example , a 100 kilowatt laser beam will be able to bring down a target in a tenth of the time it currently takes for a 10 kilowatt laser			2
the laser is able to fire and target only one incoming target at a time , so the idea is that when the lasers are fully operational they will be grouped in teams of three or five to protect against multiple incoming rounds			1
these laser units could be deployed in the future to help protect frontline units or bases			0
ultimately the laser could be used against faster moving aircraft and cruise missiles			0
the @entity135 made waves earlier this year when it unveiled that its own laser mounted aboard a destroyer had brought down test drones and which in the future could be used to fend off fast - moving attack boats			1
current plans call for the @entity135 ’s laser to be tested aboard the @entity144 , which is permanently stationed in the @entity145			0
the next phase of testing for the @entity2 ’s laser will be early next year when it is taken to an air force base along @entity152 ’s @entity151 to see how it handles a marine environment			1
so far the @entity2 ’s laser testing program has cost about $ 13 million a year since it began in 2011			1
but over the long term it looks like a good deal as the cost of taking out each mortar round is estimated to be the price of a cup of diesel fuel .			0

land - based laser weapon was being *trialled* for missile *defense*
@entity2 spent *sex* weeks testing them in @entity22 using *specially* - created drones as the attackers
invisible laser exacts the target before mortars are projected out
trucks are still about a decade from being operational
