by @entity0 they are the pride and joy of millions of gardeners			1
but @entity6 ’s carefully kept lawns are under threat this summer – from hidden invaders beneath the soil			1
experts say leatherjackets , small larvae which eat the roots of grass , are at their highest levels for 40 years			1
@entity17 , small larvae which eat the roots of grass , are at their highest level for 40 years , experts say as they attack from below the grass is killed off , turning it brown			1
the wet and mild winter provided perfect conditions for the grubs to thrive , with an estimated 250 for every square yard of turf in the worst - hit areas			1
as spring progresses the grubs are growing larger and lawns sheltering the pests will gradually develop yellow patches that turn brown			2
when fully grown in august , the grubs will pupate and emerge as crane flies – also known as daddy - long - legs			2
leatherjackets threaten farmers ’ cereal and grass crops and sports clubs have also been hit			1
a cricket club in @entity39 had to spend £ 6,000 replacing its outfield after it was eaten by the grubs			2
professor @entity41 , of @entity43 ’s @entity42 , warned there may be a plague of daddy - long - legs in august			0
‘ because of the densities we have seen , we would expect to see large numbers of daddy - long - legs on the wing , coming to lights at night , being in people ’s homes , being around in the agricultural land			0
’ he told @entity58 ’s @entity57 that the infestation would be a severe challenge to farmers in the wettest parts of the country , particularly along the west coast of @entity65 and in @entity43 , adding : ‘ if you have one million grubs per hectare it is enough to decimate your crop			0
’ a pesticide previously used to kill the bugs was banned because of its harmful impact on bees			0
an alternative method is to put a black sheet of plastic on the lawn overnight			0
the leatherjackets will be clinging to the underside in the morning and can be picked off and disposed of .			0

@entity17 at highest level for 40 years *due* to wet and mild winter
