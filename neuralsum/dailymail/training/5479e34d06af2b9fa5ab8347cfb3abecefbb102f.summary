claims : a @entity2 member of staff from @entity4			1
some other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves teachers at an @entity10 school have complained that they are being ordered to wear the hijab – even if they are not @entity2			1
employees at the @entity14 free school say they are ‘ concerned ’ by its practices , which include banning non-halal food and forcing female pupils as young as four to sit at the back of the class away from boys			1
female members of staff , some of whom are not @entity2 , say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab			1
these also ban them from wearing jewellery or bringing non-halal food on to the school ’s premises in @entity32			1
one woman , who had been interviewed for a position , claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers to avoid ‘ insult ’			2
another staff member , speaking anonymously to the @entity38 , said the school was ‘ like being in @entity41 ’			2
she said : ‘ girls are treated very separately from boys , the girls sit at the back of the classroom			1
‘ boys go and eat first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go			0
‘ it is like being in any school in @entity41			0
that is why it was founded , that is the idea			0
’ the decision to make all female members of staff , regardless of religious beliefs , wear the @entity10 headscarf – which covers the head but not the face – was apparently introduced over the summer			1
but some female members of staff have been spotted removing the headwear immediately after stepping out of the school building during their lunch hour			2
and around half a dozen teachers at the free school , who could face losing their jobs if they refuse to comply with the rules , are now seeking legal advice from the @entity72			1
regional @entity72 officer @entity73 said : ‘ we are very worried about the school and the education of the 200 children there			1
‘ there are worries over practices concerning the discrimination between male and female pupils in the school , with the girls being told to sit at the back of the class regardless of whether they can see the board properly			1
' he added : ‘ it ’s one thing to have a dress code which we can challenge and quite another to build it into a contract			0
banned : non-halal food is thought to have also been banned at the school , some of which is based in @entity95 in @entity32 , pictured			1
‘ the school is publicly accountable so there needs to be a greater level of transparency			0
’ as a free school , @entity14 operates outside local authority control but still qualifies for government funding			1
it was set up in september last year			0
allegations : the @entity72 have said they are concerned about the school , the @entity106 campus of which is shown above a hijab is typically worn by a @entity2 female beyond the age of puberty in the presence of adult males - it covers the head and chest , but not the face			1
it not only refers to the physical body covering , but also a state of mind , where al - hijab refers to ‘ the veil which separates man or the world from @entity126 ’			0
@entity127 can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in public			0
most often , it is worn by @entity2 women as a symbol of modesty , privacy and morality			0
if differs from a burqa , a veil that covers the entire body head and face , and the niqab which covers the entire head and face except for the eyes			0
@entity146 , branch secretary of the @entity147 , said the new demands stem from the @entity14 ’s free school status			1
she said : ‘ we have always had a number of concerns about this school ever since it was first set up , as essentially they can do what they like			0
‘ there is no buffer between them and the state and no protection for staff and pupils			2
‘ free schools set their own rules , curriculums and dress codes , and so long as pupils and staff are aware of them before joining , then there is no upset			2
‘ but forcing people to agree to contractual changes or face being out of work could breach employment law			0
’ former head teacher @entity176 , who left after less than a year in the post , previously said the school would ‘ honour all faiths ’			0
however he admitted that he thought at least half of the school ’s pupils would be @entity2			2
