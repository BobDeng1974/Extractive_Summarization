by @entity0 published : 09:41 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 19 october 2013 it was the car accident that uncovered a murder			1
as a young mother ’s vehicle skidded to a halt on a @entity6 , @entity8 highway , remarkably she and her three - year - old son had escaped without a scratch despite careering off the road			1
however , she was about to make an important , yet shocking discovery			0
although the car had come to rest on top of some brambles that ran alongside the @entity17 , it was what the woman stepped onto that set the mystery in motion : a human skull			0
recognize him ? investigators initially thought the man , who was wearing this shirt when found , was a boy because of his small stature			1
dental examination revealed he could have been as old as 55 hidden from view : the skeleton was discovered here , at the side of the @entity33 , hidden from view concealed : the body was found in woods that run along the center of the highway and that few , if any people , ever walk along within hours of the gruesome discovery in march 2004 , investigators from the @entity41 began to recover the rest of a fully clothed male skeleton – the body of which had been partially stuffed into a plastic bag			1
they had no idea who the man was or how he died – and more importantly , who dumped his body			1
luckily , there were some clues that cops were able to seize upon and they earnestly begin to generate a profile of the victim			1
one of their best clues to his identity was an item of clothing , an iconic artefact from the era of @entity68 and @entity69 – his 1980s members only jacket			1
evidence : it 's known as the ' @entity75 case ' , named because the man , his entire , fully clothed skeleton had been stuffed into a plastic bag and when eventually unearthed , was wearing a members only jacket change : even some coins were found in the man 's pockets - although they tell us nothing about who he was the victim was wearing a white button - down shirt , bellbottoms , tube socks and the @entity91			1
bellbottoms were popular in the 1970s , and the jacket had its heyday in the 1980s			2
the jacket was taken to a lab where detectives learned the item had been made at a factory in @entity99 in 1982			2
it meant the man had probably been hidden in the woods by the side of the highway for more than twenty years , before being found			1
almost ten years on since the discovery of the missing body in 2004 , detectives still have n’t identified the victim or figured out who might have killed him			2
‘ we want to identify him to give somebody , somewhere , closure , ’ said senior investigator @entity110 to @entity111			0
‘ maybe there ’s a kid out there who wants to know what happened to his father			0
’ @entity110 , who caught the case when the body was first found , says the 2004 investigation was ‘ painstaking , ’ and that it was frustrating not to have resolution			2
mystery : the victim was wearing this shirt when they died but did not have any @entity128 on them found : a 1970s - style ' afro - pick ' comb was found with the body the man inside the clues : despite his unglamorous clothing , he was also wearing a fancy @entity136 watch			1
the timepiece had been manufactured by the @entity139 , @entity8 , based company in 1960 , when it had carried a retail price of $ 500 bare bones : the case was only looked into when a woman involved in a car accident stepped onto a human skull after her car slid off the road ‘ when it went cold , ’ he said , ‘ i kept working on it myself			2
’ he ’s now been paired with a new investigator to take another pass at the evidence			0
there were no bullets found at the crime scene and there was no trace of identification found anywhere near the body			0
the investigators have had to make guesses about who the man was and where he may have lived			2
a computer generated reconstruction of the victim shows a high - cheekboned face with dark hair and a slightly dark complexion			2
in 1994 the @entity173 believed the victim to be @entity175 , based on his cheekbones , but @entity110 says that now he ’s not so sure			2
there were coins in the pocket of the bellbottoms , and the date on a dime , the newest coin , was 1974 , meaning the crime could n’t have happened any earlier			0
the man ’s money clip was empty but had the logo of a @entity189 heating oil company called @entity190			0
he was also wearing a fancy @entity136 watch			0
short : the man was just 5ft 1in tall and was wearing bellbottoms which were popular in the 1970s tube socks : buried for almost 30 years cops say the most distinctive thing about the dead man was his height			1
at first police thought he may have been a child because he was only 5 foot 1 but dental analysis puts the man ’s age at anywhere from 35 to 55			1
twenty years ago , during the original investigation , the combination of a fancy watch and the small stature of the man made investigators believe that he man could have been a jockey – but no jockey ’s had been reported missing			0
investigators are focusing on the man ’s height as a way of trying to identify him			0
someone who was shorter than 99 percent of @entity219 adult males			0
the case will restart its inquiry in @entity139 and attempt to retrace life in the 1980s			1
few of the missing persons cases from the early 1980s and before have been computerized			0
‘ back then missing persons cases were filed and put in a box , ’ explained @entity110			0
‘ we ’ll literally be looking through warehouses full of boxes in @entity139			0
’ anyone with information on the ‘ @entity75 ’ case should call the @entity232 at ( 631 ) 756 - 3300 .			1

police now having another attempt at solving the case
5ft 1in man lay buried at the side of one of @entity6 's *busiest* roads
case *nicknamed* the ' @entity75 murder ' because of the type of jacket worn by the victim
