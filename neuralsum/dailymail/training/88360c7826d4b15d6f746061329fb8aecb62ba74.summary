@entity0 have often been the architects of their own downfall this season and it was more of the same in the 3 - 2 defeat by @entity7 at @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity10 's misplaced pass led to @entity12 's strike and @entity14 's poor control allowed @entity15 to score the winner , meaning the @entity0 have now made 10 errors leading directly to goals this season			1
not only is that the highest amount in the @entity20 , no other team in @entity23 's top five divisions has had more serious mistakes punished			1

@entity0 's figure is almost double the amount made by @entity53 and @entity54 ( six ) , who sit joint second in the table of goal - costing errors			0
the @entity0 had only conceded 18 goals at the same stage of last season but it 's been a different story under @entity31 since august , with 31 let in already			2

below @entity53 and @entity54 in the table sit @entity7 , @entity91 and @entity92 , each of whom have made five errors leading directly to goals so far			0
@entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 have all made four , while @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 have all made three			0
@entity102 ( right ) and @entity104 's defence have made just one error leading to a goal this season despite only being out of the relegation zone on goal difference , @entity107 's @entity77 have made just mistakes which have led directly to goals - the same amount as high - flying @entity73			0
but the best record in the division is shared by @entity104 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , all of whom have conceded just once because of an individual error			0
@entity0 - 10 @entity53 - 6 @entity54 - 6 @entity7 - 5 @entity92 - 5 @entity91 - 5 @entity95 - 4 @entity96 - 4 @entity97 - 4 @entity98 - 3 @entity101 - 3 @entity99 - 3 @entity100 - 3 @entity77 - 2 @entity73 - 2 @entity104 - 1 @entity115 - 1 @entity116 - 1 @entity117 - 1 @entity118 - 1			2
