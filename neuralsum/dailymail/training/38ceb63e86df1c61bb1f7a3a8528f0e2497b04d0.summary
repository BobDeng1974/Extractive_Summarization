by @entity0 and @entity1 the birth of the @entity3 and @entity4 of @entity6 's first child - a future heir to the throne - will be announced in exactly the same way as prince @entity11 's to retain ' the theatre ' of a genuine royal occasion			1
as soon as the baby is born , a proclamation signed by doctors who delivered the boy or girl will be rushed from the ward and displayed at the gates of @entity20 within minutes			1
like the @entity21 before her , @entity4 , 31 , has chosen the @entity23 at @entity24 ’s where a natural birth , staying in a private suite , is likely to cost up to £ 10,000			2
same again : on june 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of @entity20 announcing the birth , the previous day , of prince @entity11			1
the same will happen this year with his child historic : the same easel will be used when the royal baby is born in around a month 's time ( left ) , and will use the same kind of written announcement when @entity11 came into the world ( right ) @entity11 , 30 , became the first future monarch in history to be born in a hospital when he was delivered there on june 21 , 1982 , followed by his brother , @entity44 , two years later			1
although both @entity20 and @entity48 have their own @entity49 accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now broken , it will most definitely not be the preferred medium to announce the new royal baby			1
instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy @entity56 size @entity20 - headed paper , signed by the medical staff who have assisted the @entity4 , will be brought out of the @entity23 ’s front entrance by a press officer			1
it will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the streets of @entity63 – escorted by police outriders - to the @entity65 at the front of @entity20			1
loving mother : @entity21 , the @entity68 with her son , prince @entity11 , on her lap at @entity71			0
her son and his wife will also hold a similar official shoot after the baby is born there it will then be placed on an easel , last used to announce prince @entity11 ’s birth , by the main gates in the palace forecourt			1
this will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born			1
31 years ago : a newborn prince @entity11 with @entity68 and prince @entity85 outside @entity86 on june 22 , 1982 ‘ we wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice			1
it is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands			0
this is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne			2
it is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence , ' a @entity88 spokesman said			2
‘ it is very important [ to us ] that it will not be announced first on @entity49 , although it will be announced on @entity49 in due course			1
’ at the same time , however , @entity71 does plan to send out an ' electronic press release ' containing a little more detail , such as the baby ’s weight			2
when prince @entity11 was born , for example , it was revealed by press officers that he had blue eyes and had ‘ cried lustily ’ as he was handed to his parents			0
however , if the baby is born between 10.30pm and 8am , the news will be sent out via press release with the easel being erected later that morning , at around 9am			1
‘ if the baby is born late at night , it would be unreasonable not to tell anyone [ and ] we would n’t run around with a police escort at 3am			2
we would be slightly disappointed not to announce it on the easel first , but would still put the notice up the next morning , ’ an aide explained			2
palace sources have also made clear the birth will not be made public until the @entity134 and senior members of the royal family have been informed - and , of course , the @entity138 , in the unlikely scenario that they are not at the hospital			2
@entity141 understands that @entity11 himself is likely to phone the queen before anyone else , even his own father , depending on what time of day the baby is born			0
‘ clearly if they are together the @entity149 will be informed pretty quickly …			0
efforts will be made to contact the @entity134 soon after and members of the royal family will be told as soon as is practically possible			0
whether they are woken depends on what time of day it was , ’ the source added			0
happy moment : when @entity11 was born , details were released almost immediately , including that he had blue eyes and had ' cried lustily ' as he was handed to his parents it is also hoped that @entity11 will make a short statement on the steps of the hospital after the good news has been dispersed – as will the @entity138 , although the mechanics of this have yet to be discussed			0
‘ while it is a deeply personal and private event , the @entity3 and @entity4 realise this is a time of national celebration and that there will be vast interest in the baby			0
they realise many people will want to share in their happiness , ’ a spokesman said			0
unusually , palace officials will also make public the fact that the @entity4 has gone into labour within minutes of her being admitted to hospital and being seen by a doctor			0
while palace aides are keen to retain @entity4 ’s ‘ dignity ’ as a woman in labour , they acknowledge the fact that social media such as @entity49 will make it almost impossible to keep her admittance a secret unless she is smuggled in			1
the @entity189 ’s official surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity188 , the former fiancée of murdered television presenter @entity190 , is by happy co-incidence a consultant gynaecologist at @entity24 ’s and will be assisting with the labour			0
he will be led by the @entity134 ’s own surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity193			0
it is understood that contingency plans have been put in place with other hospitals , such as the @entity198 in @entity199 , in case the @entity4 goes into labour when visiting her parents .			0
