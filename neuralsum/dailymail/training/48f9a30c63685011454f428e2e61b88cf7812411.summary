@entity13 , an @entity5 spy who was @entity6 's oldest friend , has revealed the extraordinary lengths to which intelligence officials went in order to protect the notorious figure			1
@entity6 came under suspicion when two other members of the @entity20 spy ring fled to @entity21 - but despite a 12 - year investigation , he was never brought to justice and was eventually allowed to defect to the @entity10 himself			1
@entity5 chiefs refused to believe that he could be guilty because of his apparently distinguished service and @entity27 background , and shielded him from an @entity29 probe			0
@entity13 was a childhood friend of @entity6 's after the pair attended @entity31 together , and they travelled across @entity32 as students in the early 1930s			1
when @entity6 joined @entity5 , he recruited @entity34 to be his deputy , giving the author a unique insight into the investigation which eventually unveiled his old friend as a foreign agent			1
in 1951 , @entity41 and @entity43 - old friends with @entity6 from their @entity20 days - fled to @entity21 after being unmasked as @entity10 spies			1
it was obvious that someone had tipped the two men off to allow them to escape , and @entity6 was eventually forced to resign his position as the senior @entity9 spy liaising with @entity51 officials			2
defector : @entity6 pictured in @entity21 after defecting to the @entity10 in 1963 couple : the double agent married his fourth wife , @entity55 , after settling in @entity56 however , @entity13 's book - titled @entity6 : the unknown story of the @entity59 's @entity58 - reveals that @entity5 bosses did not believe that he was actually guilty of @entity10 spying , according to the @entity62			1
' there were very few people in the service who had inspired so much trust and respect as @entity6 , and so much affection among those who had worked closely with him , ' the author writes			0
' the general office belief was that he 'd had to go simply to preserve good relations with the @entity51			0
' sir @entity73 , head of @entity5 during the war , even told the director of @entity29 that @entity6 - who had previously been in charge of detecting double agents - ' could n't possibly be a traitor '			1

the next year , bosses decided to send an agent to @entity91 to interrogate him , but @entity5 insisted on sending one of @entity6 's ex-colleagues , @entity98 , rather than a famously tough @entity29 agent			1
@entity13 reveals in his book that @entity98 - who believed @entity6 when he said he had stopped spying for the @entity59 16 years earlier - made several blunders in the questioning which allowed the double agent to walk free yet again			1
@entity98 's recording of the interrogation was inaudible because of the noise of traffic outside , and he allowed @entity6 not to sign a statement in which he admitted his guilt , instead saying he would return for another meeting later			0
before that meeting took place , @entity6 vanished in january 1963 and settled in @entity21 , where he lived for 25 years before his death			2
@entity5 officials continued to insist that he had given them valuable information about other agents , according to @entity13 , even telling @entity118 that he had helped detect @entity10 spies in @entity9			2
the security services tried to block the appearance of @entity13 's book , but after he died in 2010 his family continued the fight against censorship , and this week it will be published by @entity126			2
the ' @entity128 ' spying scandal rocked the @entity27 by revealing @entity10 double agents at the heart of many of @entity9 's most storied institutions			0
@entity6 , @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity81 all met at the @entity20 , where @entity81 was an academic and the other three were undergraduates			2
the older man recruited the students to the @entity10 cause before the @entity137 - and they remained devoted to the @entity10 even after the start of the @entity139			0
@entity6 was head of counter-intelligence for @entity5 , while @entity43 was a @entity141 official and @entity41 worked for the @entity142			0

in 1951 , @entity41 and @entity43 were exposed as double agents - but after being tipped off by @entity6 they were able to escape to @entity21			2
despite the suspicion surrounding @entity6 , he avoided detection until 1963 , when he too defected to the @entity10			0
@entity81 escaped exposure for even longer - it was not until 1979 , when @entity159 named him as a suspect in the @entity161 , that he confessed to his treachery and was stripped of his titles			0
the ' fifth man ' in the spy ring has never been definitively identified , but was named as @entity84 by @entity59 defector @entity166			0
