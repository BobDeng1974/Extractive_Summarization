a new survey has found 56 per cent of employees hired are not meeting the demands of a job two years after joining the company one of the study ’s respondents said despite knowing a candidate was being dishonest about their experience they still hired them because they were desperate for a hire			2
the study was commissioned by @entity6 , but was carried out by independent researcher @entity32 in june			2
it surveyed more than 500 @entity8 managers across a variety of industries - including finance and banking , information technology , local government , engineering , media and hospitality			2
