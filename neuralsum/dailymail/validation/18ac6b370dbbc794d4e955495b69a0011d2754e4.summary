' i never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam			0
before i got into rugby i was bullied at school			1
try ! @entity3 turned out twice a week for her local side from the age of 12 the ' boffin ' has grown up : @entity3 now has a boyfriend , 22 - year - old gym instructor @entity53 more comfortable in boots : @entity3 says that she had to practice ' loads ' to walk properly wearing heels ' i was n't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me ' boffin ' and ' ugly '			1
even in my teens i did n't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling			2
