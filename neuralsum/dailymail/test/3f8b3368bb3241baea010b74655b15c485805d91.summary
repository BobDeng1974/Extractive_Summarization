heavy - duty : the drill that was used by thieves during the brazen £ 60million @entity3 heist this is the drill that was used by thieves during the £ 60million @entity3 heist over the @entity6 weekend			1
the gang used the power tool to cut through the wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems			1
the photograph of the @entity17 drill was released tonight by @entity18 as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an ' @entity23 '			1
police are offering a £ 20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid			1
the six men were captured on @entity32 as they carried out the bold raid in @entity35 's diamond district			2
they used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank 's strongroom , where they ransacked security vaults			1
but , amazingly , the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement			1
images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in @entity35 's diamond district			2
safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty @entity17 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby			1
@entity18 also described how there was rubbish covering the @entity3 basement , while the wrought - iron cage door had been broken down			1
an angle grinder , concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes			1
officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building , indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside			2
one of the theories behind the heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises			2
the @entity83 is housed in a seven - storey building , which accommodates 60 other businesses , including watch traders and diamond wholesalers			0
the thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor , before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived at the scene - to climb down to the vault			0

' people 's property has been taken , people 's pensions , people 's heirlooms which obviously ca n't be replaced by insurance firms			0
' we may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost @entity135 type team , but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves			1
' destruction : dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in @entity35 , where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor covered in dust and debris : @entity151 , the forced door to the vault and , right , the mess left in the corridor inside knowledge : the gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door , pictured carefully planned : officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft ( pictured ) to climb down @entity169 , a former dci with the @entity171 who worked for the @entity118 for five years in the mid- 90s , said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the heist was an inside job			1

saturday , april 4 , sunday april 5 and monday , april 6 : the exact time of the raid has not been confirmed , but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes , it is thought to have taken many hours			1

they call the police , who attend			0
