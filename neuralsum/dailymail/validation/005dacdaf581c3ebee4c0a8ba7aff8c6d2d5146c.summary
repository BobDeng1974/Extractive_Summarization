a new dating app claims to be ' putting the excitement back into dating ' by pushing users ' personalities ahead of their looks			1
much like @entity6 - the notorious dating app responsible for making ' swipe left ' a cultural reference - @entity8 can hook you up with people living in your area			1
but rather than have singles base their dating choices on potentially cringeworthy profile pictures , the app ' fuzzes ' your face to let your listed interests do the matchmaking instead			1
new dating app @entity8 blurs out profile pictures to let the listed interests and personality traits of its users become the the main attraction all @entity8 dating profile pictures are blurred to start off with ( pictured right ) , though you can reveal what you look like further down the line			1
age , height and ethnicity can still be used as search filters , to help people find their perfect match ( pictured left ) claiming to ' bring courtship back to the 21st century ' , the app allows users to list up to ten interests when they sign up , along with a 160 character bio			0
you 'll also need to enter your age , height , location , star sign and ethnicity , which can all be used as filters for potential dates to find what they 're looking for			0
once your vitals are in and your profile set up , you can search people by their proximity to you , just like on @entity6 , and give anyone you like a thumbs up , or ' nudge '			2
if a person you 've ' nudged ' gives you a nudge back , congratulations , you 've made a match and can now start messaging			0
blending @entity66 's @entity65 button with @entity6 's swipe left or swipe right function , @entity8 asks you to swipe right to ' nudge ' a person you like			0
if they nudge you back , you have a match and can start chatting once you 've reached the messaging stage with a potential date , this is where the fuzzy fun really begins			0
though the idea behind the app is find matches based on your common interests and compatibility , singles do n't have to agree to a blind date			2
both participants have the option to either partially or fully reveal their profile picture , before anyone has shelled out for dinner or a drink			0
found a @entity91 match ? once you 've started a conversation you can chose to reveal as much of your profile picture as you like , by altering the level of fuziness using the sliding scale stuck for words ? the messaging feature in the dating app includes a long list of conversation templates , some far more flirty than others , to help even the shiest of daters get the ball rolling launching last night with a vip bash in @entity112 , the app already has celebrity backing from the likes of @entity116 ' @entity115 , actresses @entity105 and @entity107 , @entity108 winner @entity108 , and @entity109 cast members @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
founded by @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity91 is aimed at people aged between 18 and 45 , looking for the perfect match			0
the app can even help you kick off the conversation if you 're feeling a little shy , with a whole host of pre-written message templates			2
@entity116 star @entity115 showed his support for the new dating app , which rivals the already immensely popular @entity6 , responsible for bringing ' swipe left ' into common conversation lord @entity135 's @entity134 2014 winner @entity108 has thrown his business initiative behind the new launch actress @entity107 was keen to share on @entity139 how to app can help people find love based on more than just appearances			1
