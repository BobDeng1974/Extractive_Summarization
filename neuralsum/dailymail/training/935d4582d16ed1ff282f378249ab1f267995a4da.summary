@entity58 of @entity59 is currently in hospital being treated for acute morning sickness			1
while a royal source said the couple and their families are concerned about her illness , they have been ' reassured ' it is not a dangerous condition for either the the @entity8 or her baby			2
the couple delighted millions around the world – including their own families – with the happy news yesterday			2
@entity0 already has son @entity49 with ex dj @entity56 but as the word spread , the parents - to - be were together in hospital , facing the first hurdle in a much longed for pregnancy			1
@entity8 , 30 , who is barely eight weeks pregnant , was taken to the hospital just after lunch by her husband and immediately put on a drip to stop her becoming dehydrated			0
@entity8 will be staying in hospital for a few more days with @entity85 saying it 's the rest she needs last night she appeared to be responding well to treatment			0
sources said there was ‘ no cause for alarm ’			0

@entity100 ( @entity101 ) is a rare condition believed to affect up to two per cent of women in pregnancy and is a severe form of morning sickness			1
@entity8 is amongst the 2 % of women suffering from acute morning sickness it tends to be more common in young mothers , women who are in their first pregnancy , and those with multiple pregnancies			1

however , leading doctors say that along with more ordinary morning sickness , it is a sign the pregnancy is progressing			2
dr @entity142 , consultant obstetrician and medical director of the @entity144 , says : ‘ it is almost always a positive sign that the pregnancy is progressing well			0
‘ the sickness is thought to be due to a rise in hormone levels			2
it normally occurs during weeks six and eight of pregnancy , when the placenta takes over production of hormones from the ovaries			0
‘ it generally continues until around 12 or 14 weeks , but if it stops before , it can — although not always — be a sign that all is not well			0
