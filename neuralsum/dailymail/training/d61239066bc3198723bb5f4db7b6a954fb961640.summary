these stunning photographs look like the ultimate holiday snaps of idyllic tropical destinations			1
but in fact , the images were not even taken outside - they were crafted in a studio using props including nuts , chocolate and jelly bean			0
artist @entity10 spent up to 700 hours on each fake landscape , making them into lifelike depictions of scenes such as a desert island , a lightning storm and a brook at sunset			1
@entity19 : but this photograph does not show a real landscape , and was made from turkey feathers and cooking sugar coral reef : this work , ' how to breathe underwater ' , uses clever lighting to appear as if it were made under the sea scary : ' @entity30 ' has a black plexiglass background and is backlit to create the lightning effect one piece even appears to show an underwater coral reef - but the marine ambience was created with lighting and innovative materials			1
to make the piece he used walnuts , candle wax , wire , glitter , peanut shells , dead starfish , compressed moss , jellybeans , coated seashells , toothpaste , clay , figs , feathers , cotton earbuds and chocolates			0
the surface of the ocean is actually a vinyl shower curtain over suspended plexiglass , while the piece 's underwater glow comes from fake fog and a video projector			2
the 30 - year - old from @entity65 , @entity66 has been making his deceptive artworks for the past three years			1
@entity68 : ' @entity69 ' was made from ostrich feathers , a painted paper background and even chocolate for the mud turbulent : ' @entity74 ' depicts the same scene but in stormy weather , showing the artist 's versatility countryside : ' @entity81 1 ' sewing thread , sticks , wood and feathers , with fake moss and dip - dyed cotton for the grass mystery : even at close up , it can be hard to work out what mr @entity10 's works are really made of ' i 'm trying to change people 's perspectives of small objects by creating something big with them , ' mr @entity10 said			1
for the storm depicted in ' @entity30 ' , the artist etched lightning bolts into a backlit slab of black plexiglass , allowing the light to pass through			1
' i became very interested in creating an illusion of light - so i created light boxes and modifiers , ' he said			0
' i set the scene to depict how it would look in nature - the lighting bolts serve as the only source of light in the entire image			0
' hard at work : mr @entity10 finesses cotton clouds which fill the sky in his work ' @entity118 ' @entity120 : the base for ' @entity118 ' was made out of caramelised sugar which resembles the ocean elaborate : each miniature piece takes up to 700 hours to create - all for the sake of a single photograph technical : the artist has been producing his unique creations for the past three years mr @entity10 has been fascinated by miniature movie sets since childhood , and when he was a student at the @entity131 he made table - top dioramas			1
for ' @entity69 ' and ' @entity74 ' , he created a willow tree from hand - dyed ostrich feathers , painted parchment paper water , chocolate mud , wire , cotton , coffee , synthetic potting moss and raffia ribbon			0
' a mistake with something when making one set can actually lead to new discoveries and new ideas on how to use the materials i find , ' he said			0
' so mistakes can actually create entirely new sets			0
' i 'm always looking at materials and seeing what i could do differently with them			0
' innovation : mr @entity10 etched lightning bolts into a sheet of black plexiglass to light up one of his works set : mr @entity10 , 30 , works out of his studio set up in his living room in @entity65 , @entity66 ' @entity118 ' took four months to complete , and is comprised of spray - painted turkey feathers for the palm trees , and cooked sugar on top of tin foil for the water			1
his ' @entity169 ' was created from sewing thread , sticks , wood and hand dyed ostrich plumes			0
the grass in the set was made of faux potting moss and dip dyed cotton			2
mr @entity10 has completed about 30 sets in total and is releasing his new book , @entity183 , in october			2
careful : delicate objects such as the willow tree made from ostrich feathers in ' @entity69 ' require a deft touch different angle : looking at ' @entity74 ' side on clearly shows that it is a product of artificial creation misleading : the underwater effects in some works are created by clever use of the camera and lights			2
