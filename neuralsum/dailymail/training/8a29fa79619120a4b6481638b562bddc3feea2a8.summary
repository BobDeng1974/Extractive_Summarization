some 67 per cent said they did not mind if health services were run by the @entity5 or by privately owned businesses , provided it was free , while 30 per cent disagreed			2
a majority of @entity24 supporters - 59 per cent - say they do not mind who provides @entity5 services , with the working class least bothered of all			1
the research , carried out by @entity18 for @entity39 , also found that voters trust @entity24 more than the conservatives on health issues , with 33 per cent backing leader @entity43 to protect the @entity5 , and 29 per cent trusting prime minister @entity44			1
@entity45 , head of political polling at @entity18 , said : ' beyond the economy and immigration , the @entity5 will be the key policy issue on which the 2015 general election is decided , and the fact that most @entity3 say they are willing to pay more tax in order to protect the @entity5 just goes to show the peril of being seen by voters to neglect it			1
' although traditionally it has been difficult for the @entity41 to get traction with voters on the @entity5 , voters seem to trust neither leader particularly to protect what is perceived as a valuable national institution			2
' meanwhile , @entity24 's poll lead has dropped from five to two points since last month , @entity18 found			0

over the weekend , former conservative health secretary @entity87 called on @entity44 to boost the @entity5 budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis			0
he was joined by the new chair of the @entity92 , @entity94 mp @entity93 , who warned that it was ' hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service ' if spending was not increased			0
@entity100 , a @entity65 former health minister , meanwhile said that the @entity5 needed an extra £ 15 billion over the next five years ' if you do n't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament '			2
@entity24 is intending to make the the @entity5 a key battleground at the next election and has promised a ' big offer ' on health care			1
it is considering three options to boost @entity5 spending : a ring - fenced rise in national insurance contributions for employers and workers ; delaying the deficit - reduction programme and a budget increase once the nation ’s books have been balanced			0
health secretary @entity119 is under pressure to increase the @entity5 's budget amid warnings that the health service is facing a financial crisis as chancellor , @entity125 raised @entity126 by one per cent in 2002 to help bring @entity3 ’s spending on health up to the @entity130 average			0
some @entity24 figures are wary that such a pledge now could undermine mr @entity43 ’s ' cost of living ' agenda as higher @entity126 would put more pressure on family budgets			0
but last night @entity24 supporters of a major health cash promise took comfort from the @entity18 findings			0
