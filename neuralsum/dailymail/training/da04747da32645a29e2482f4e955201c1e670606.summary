@entity12 , 33 , was involved in a custody battle with @entity3 , 29 , and wanted her dead so that he would not have to share access to their son @entity16 , five			1
he began planning her death immediately after he received a solicitor ’s letter telling him she was seeking increased time with the boy			0
@entity24 , a chemistry graduate who worked as an industrial hygienist , created what he believed was a cast iron alibi putting himself 40 miles away from the scene of the killing in @entity30			1
police instead arrested miss @entity3 ’s fiance @entity32 , 32 , who found her body after calling at her terrace home in the city when she failed to answer his phone calls			2
mr @entity32 was held for three days and questioned about the murder while @entity24 remained free , giving police a detailed witness statement setting out his movements on the day of the killing			2
he had switched off his mobile phone during the crucial period so that his true whereabouts could not be tracked			0
but what he had not reckoned with was that the satnav in his @entity48 estate car had recorded his every move			0
it showed that instead of driving directly from his home in @entity1 to go mountain biking in @entity53 , as he claimed , he had travelled via @entity30 and left his car in a secluded layby outside the city for two - and - a - half hours			1
however , the sat nav on his mobile phone showed he had actually stopped off in a lay - by in @entity30 he then cycled to his ex-wife ’s home , lay in wait for her to return from the morning school run and battered her to death			1
the court heard she had been ‘ struck repeatedly and with force ’ , causing brain damage which killed her			0
he attempted to make it look as if a burglary had taken place			0
detectives trawled through 3,000 hours of @entity75 footage from across the city to find images of @entity24 cycling to and from the murder scene wearing a distinctive blue helmet			1
forensic tests on the bicycle and his watch revealed traces of his ex-wife ’s blood			0
officers arrested @entity24 and freed mr @entity32			2
@entity24 , who is @entity88 and of @entity90 origin , of @entity91 , @entity1 , denied murdering miss @entity3 on june 17 but was found guilty by a jury at @entity93 at the end of a month - long trial			1
@entity96 , @entity97 , prosecuting , said : ‘ @entity3 was killed for a reason			2
the only person who had a reason and a motive to kill her was him			0
this was n’t a random killing			0
’ @entity75 footage from businesses across the city was pieced together by more than 50 officers during the case the footage , and information from the sat nav , enabled police to link @entity24 to the murder despite his alibi mr @entity96 said that after the killing @entity24 went on to @entity53 , buying a parking ticket and obtaining a timed receipt at a cafe to back up his alibi			1
when police told him of miss @entity3 ’s death , he gave a lengthy statement detailing how he had set off from home between 7am and 8am and drove straight to @entity53 , where he went biking			1
he said he later visited the site cafe before driving home			0
but he slipped up when he agreed to hand his satnav to police			0
the subsequent check of the device revealed that @entity24 had actually set off around 6am and travelled via @entity30 , stopping for two - and - a - half hours in the layby			1
then a witness came forward to say he had seen a cyclist matching @entity24 ’s description loitering outside the scene of the murder , and @entity24 was arrested			2
judge @entity134 yesterday jailed him for life and ordered him to serve a minimum of 28 years			1
the judge said : ‘ you are a very intelligent and very clever man			0
when poor @entity32 , a wholly innocent man , was in custody for three days i have no doubt that you thought you had committed the perfect murder and got away with it			0
‘ you are a cold , calculating individual and a liar but you did n’t fool the jury as you mendaciously attempted to explain away the constellation of compelling evidence that the prosecution produced			0
’ @entity24 was convicted of murder at @entity93 ( pictured ) and jailed for life , to serve a minimum of 28 years in prison			1
the judge told him he was a ' a cold , calculating individual and a liar ' during the four - week trial			2

@entity0 , 33 , jailed for life for murdering his ex-wife @entity3 , 29
@entity24 told officers he was biking in @entity53 at time of the murder
but sat nav showed he stopped in a @entity30 lay - by for more than two hours
it gave him time to cycle to victim 's house , commit crime and return to car
police used sat nav and @entity75 footage to place him at murder on june 17
jailed for life , to serve minimum of 28 years , at @entity93 today
