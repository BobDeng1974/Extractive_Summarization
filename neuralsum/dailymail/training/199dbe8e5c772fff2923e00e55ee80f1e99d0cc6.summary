by @entity0 with new statistics showing that men in @entity4 are being paid 13.2 per cent more than their female counterparts , it 's not surprising that working women are feeling hard done by			1
in fact a huge 44 per cent of women believe their gender has hindered their careers , or will in the future , according to a new survey			1
and though @entity14 ’s latest parade of female cabinet members speaks of a change of attitudes towards women in traditionally “ male ” working environments , 12 per cent of women do not believe their employer values men and equally , no matter what their level			1
fighting against the glass ceiling : @entity25 earn 13.2 per cent more than women ( posed by models ) a survey by talking talent , a consultancy firm working to inspire working women , hinted that workplace sexism is keeping women out of top roles , with 12 per cent of women saying they have been passed over for promotion because of their sex			1
for every pound men earned in 2013 , women received only 86.8p – down from 89.1p in 2012 – making it unsurprising that over a third of women say they have experienced workplace prejudice			1
and across the @entity46 , for every male pound the average earning for women is 80p , according to figures from the @entity48 obtained by @entity49			2
experts believe the gap is due to men being awarded bigger bonuses - approximately £ 6,442 for men in management roles compared with £ 3,029 for women , according to the @entity57 - while women are relegated into part - time jobs with lower pay			0
shadow women 's minister @entity63 told the @entity64 ' whether you ’re a chief executive or hairdresser , women across the capital are being paid less than men for doing the same or equivalent work			1
making it a priority : @entity71 women 's minister @entity63 ' there are some great examples of companies that are leading the way in efforts to close the gap but delivering equal pay should be a priority for all employers			0
' though it ’s not all bad news , with 80 per cent of women saying they feel their employer is supportive of them , there ’s no denying that there ’s a long way to go before there ’s total gender equality in the workplace			1
law , education and accountancy seem to be the career areas that women feel most supported in , with working mothers saying that employers in these industries are particularly supportive			2
of these sectors accountancy tops the list as the best area for working women , receiving the highest scores for positive behaviour towards women by employers			0
on the flip side , working women have named the advertising , media , engineering and construction industries as the worst sectors to work in			0
for working mothers in particular , your career – like your children – can sometimes present a paradox , as the results of the survey show			0
with a third of employers offering careers breaks for women to have a child , and 14 per cent offering subsidised childcare , just over seventy per cent of working mothers say their employer is supportive			2
but unfortunately , as the gender pay gap demonstrates , it ’s not all rosy for women who want to have a career and children			2
just get on with it ! @entity133 thinks women should stop complaining about the ' glass ceiling ' a third of women have experienced workplace prejudice or discrimination because they were a mother , while 37 per cent said being a working mother has hindered their career , including being passed over for promotion			1
however , while the government continues to strive for equality in the workplace , some female business leaders say it ’s time that women stopped moaning about the glass ceiling and just got on with it			0
dame @entity133 , 80 , who launched her own it services company , @entity152 , in 1962 , says that women today do n’t know how good they ’ve got it			0
in her recent @entity156 article she wrote ‘ if only aggrieved women knew what i had to put up with just a generation before , they might moan less and , instead , focus on the giddy heights now firmly within their grasp			0
' believe me , women today would baulk at some of the blatant , institutionalised sexism that not only existed , but was actively encouraged [ 50 years ago ]			0
