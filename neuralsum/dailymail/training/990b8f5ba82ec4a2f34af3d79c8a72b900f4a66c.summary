by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:25 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 22:41 est , 15 june 2013 top @entity3 intelligence officials said on saturday that information gleaned from two controversial data - collection programs run by the @entity6 thwarted potential terrorist plots in the @entity3 and more than 20 other countries - and that gathered data is destroyed every five years			1
last year , fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of @entity3 phone records gathered daily by the @entity6 in one of the programs , the intelligence officials said in arguing that the programs are far less sweeping than their detractors allege			1
no other new details about the plots or the countries involved were part of the newly declassified information released to @entity23 on saturday and made public by the @entity24			0
the @entity25 : hundreds of millions of records of @entity3 phone calls were collected under a provision of the @entity29 with just only 300 ' queried ' in 2012 for additional information about the callers intelligence officials said they are working to declassify the dozens of plots @entity6 chief gen. @entity36 said were disrupted , to show @entity3 the value of the programs , but that they want to make sure they do n't inadvertently reveal parts of the @entity3 counterterrorism playbook in the process			1
the release of information follows a bruising week for @entity3 intelligence officials who testified on @entity44 , defending programs that were unknown to the public - and some lawmakers - until they were revealed by a series of media stories in @entity49 and the @entity51 newspapers , leaked by former @entity6 contractor @entity52 , who remains in hiding in @entity54			1
@entity52 : he told the @entity55 this week that the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) had led more than 61,000 hacking operations worldwide , including many in @entity54 and mainland @entity58 support : hundreds of people in @entity54 have marched to the @entity3 consulate in support of @entity63 whistleblower @entity52			1
the protesters demanded that local authorities protect mr @entity52 , who is in hiding in @entity54 the disclosures have sparked debate and legal action against the @entity70 administration by privacy activists who say the data collection goes far beyond what was intended when expanded counterterrorism measures were authorized by @entity23 after the terror attacks of sept. 11 , 2001			0
intelligence officials said saturday that both @entity6 programs are reviewed every 90 days by the secret court authorized by the @entity79			1
under the program , the records , showing things like time and length of call , can only be examined for suspected connections to terrorism , they said			0
the officials offered more detail on how the phone records program helped the @entity6 stop a 2009 @entity92 plot to blow up @entity94 subways			2
gen. @entity36 , director of the @entity6 and head of the @entity96 : he defended the internet and telephone data snooping programmes , saying they had disrupted dozens of terror plots they say the program helped them track a co-conspirator of @entity92 operative @entity106 - though it 's not clear why the @entity107 needed the @entity6 to investigate @entity106 's phone records because the @entity107 would have had the authority to gather records of @entity106 's phone calls after identifying him as a suspect , rather than relying on the sweeping collection program			1
in revealing some of the foiled plots , the @entity6 has also acknowledged in a new classified briefing that it does not need court authorization to listen to domestic phone calls			1
rep. @entity119 , a @entity94 @entity120 , disclosed this week that during a secret briefing to members of @entity23 , he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed ' simply based on an analyst deciding that			2
' if the @entity6 wants ' to listen to the phone , ' an analyst 's decision is sufficient , without any other legal authorization required , @entity119 said he learned			2
' i was rather startled , ' said @entity119 , an attorney and congressman who serves on the @entity133			0
defense : intelligence officials have insisted agents do not listen in on @entity3 ' telephone conversations and maintain the internet communications surveillance programmer targeted only non-americans located outside of the @entity3 not only does this disclosure shed more light on how the @entity6 's formidable eavesdropping apparatus works domestically it also suggests the @entity143 has secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of low - ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls			1
the same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages , text messages , and instant messages			2
the disclosure appears to confirm some of the allegations made by @entity52 , a former @entity6 infrastructure analyst who leaked classified documents to the @entity49			0
@entity52 said in a video interview that , while not all @entity6 analysts had this ability , he could from @entity162 ' wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president			0
' supporting @entity52 : @entity54 's government says it does not comment on individual cases but will follow any request according to the law			0
analysts say any attempts to bring mr @entity52 to @entity3 may take months and could be blocked by @entity174 earlier reports have indicated that the @entity6 has the ability to record nearly all domestic and international phone calls -- in case an analyst needed to access the recordings in the future			1
@entity182 , a former @entity6 technical director who helped to modernize the agency 's worldwide eavesdropping network , told the @entity185 this week that the @entity6 records the phone calls of 500,000 to 1 million people who are on its so - called target list , and perhaps even more			1
' they look through these phone numbers and they target those and that 's what they record , ' @entity182 said			0
former @entity107 counterterrorism agent @entity196 told @entity197 last month that , in national security investigations , the bureau can access records of a previously made telephone call			0
' all of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not , ' he said			0
@entity196 added in an appearance the next day that , thanks to the ' intelligence community ' -- an apparent reference to the @entity6 -- ' there 's a way to look at digital communications in the past			0
' @entity6 director @entity36 said this week that his agency 's analysts abide by the law : " they do this lawfully			2
they take compliance oversight , protecting civil liberties and privacy and the security of this nation to their heart every day			0

president @entity70 will discuss surveillance programs at next week 's @entity227
@entity229 and other @entity227 members have protested the @entity6 programs
*critics* say the @entity6 can loop in phone calls and e-mails from people in other countries
