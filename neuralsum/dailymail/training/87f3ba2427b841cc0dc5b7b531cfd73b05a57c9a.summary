by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 28 august 2013 the first ever @entity2 live stream of an operation using @entity4 has been made by a surgeon in @entity6			1
the surgeon used @entity4 to consult with a distant colleague using live , point - of - view video from the operating room			1
the live stream was part of the exclusive @entity13 , which invited only 1,000 people in the @entity2 to test the device			1
‘ it ’s a privilege to be a part of this project as we explore how this exciting new technology might be incorporated into the everyday care of our patients , ’ said dr. @entity31 , the physician who performed the surgery and director of sports medicine at @entity18			0
‘ to be honest , once we got into the surgery , i often forgot the device was there			0
it just seemed very intuitive and fit seamlessly			0
’ @entity4 has a frame similar to traditional glasses , but instead of lenses , there is a small glass block that sits above the right eye			1
on that glass is a computer screen that , with a simple voice command , allows users to pull up information as they would on any other computer			0
attached to the front of the device is a camera that offers a point - of - view image and the ability to take both photos and videos while the device is worn			1
video : a recording of the surgery that was transmitted live via @entity4 @entity70 students watched the surgery transmitted live			1
across town , one of dr @entity75 colleagues , dr @entity71 , watched the surgery his office during this procedure at the medical center ’s @entity81 facility , dr @entity31 wore the device as he performed surgery on @entity85 , 47 , from @entity86 , @entity6 , who hurt her knee playing softball			0
as he performed her operation at a facility on the east side of @entity93 , @entity4 showed his vantage point via the internet to audiences miles away			1
one of @entity31 ’s @entity18 colleagues , dr. @entity71 , watched the surgery his office in another part of town , while on the main campus , several students at the @entity70 watched on their laptops			0
‘ to have the opportunity to be a medical student and share in this technology is really exciting , ’ said @entity104 , a second - year medical student who watched the surgery remotely			0
how @entity4 works : a @entity110 designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image 1,000 people in the @entity2 have been chosen to test @entity4 as part of @entity116 's @entity13 ‘ this could have huge implications , not only from the medical education perspective , but because a doctor can use this technology remotely , it could spread patient care all over the world in places that we do n’t have it already			1
’ in the future , doctors could use voice commands to instantly call up x-ray or @entity133 images of their patient , pathology reports or reference materials			0
they could collaborate live and face - to - face with colleagues via the internet , anywhere in the world			1
‘ it puts you right there , real time , ’ said dr @entity142 , who is the executive director of the @entity143 at @entity18			1
‘ not only might you be able to call up any kind of information you need or to get the help you need , but it ’s the ability to do it immediately that ’s so exciting , ’ he said			0
‘ now , we just have to start using it			0
like many technologies , it needs to be evaluated in different situations to find out where the greatest value is and how it can impact the lives of our patients in a positive way			0
’ @entity13 started shipping the @entity164 prototypes in april and the device is expected to arrive on the market for the general public later this year			0
around 10,000 people throughout the world are trying out an early version of @entity4 with most of them selected as part of a contest			1
to get a sense of the advantages and drawbacks of the device , the @entity173 spoke to three @entity4 owners who have been using the device since late spring			2
the trio 's favorite feature , by far , is the hands - free camera that shoots photos and video through voice commands			2
images can also be captured by pressing a small button along the top of the right frame of @entity4			2
they also liked being able to connect to the internet simply by tapping on the right frame of @entity4 to turn it on and then swiping along the same side to scroll through a menu			1
that menu allows them to do such things as get directions on @entity13 's map or find a piece of information through @entity13 's search engine			0
the information is shown on a thumbnail - sized transparent screen attached just above the right eye to stay out of a user 's field of vision			2
among the biggest shortcomings they cited was @entity4 ' short battery life , especially if a lot of video is being taken			2
although @entity13 says @entity4 should last for an entire day on a single battery charge for the typical user , users claimed there were times when theyran out of power after 90 minutes to two hours during periods when recording a lot of video .			2

this is the first ever @entity2 live stream of an operation via @entity4
it showed doctor 's vantage point via the internet to audiences miles away
it also allowed the doctor to consult in real - time with a distant colleague
