it has moved about 275 yards since sunday morning			2

crews have been building temporary access roads and trying to protect @entity146 , a route traveled by as many as 10,000 cars a day			0

@entity3 , one of the world 's most active , has been erupting continuously since 1983			0
this is not an eruption at the caldera , the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop			2
decomposition of vegetation in the lava 's path has created methane gas , which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast , @entity107 said			1
' it 's not a massive explosion , ' she said			0
' but it can dislodge rocks			0
it can hurl large rocks several feet			0

country - style living why would someone live on an active volcano ? unlike @entity249 , the state 's biggest city on the island of @entity252 , the @entity5 's @entity171 region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life			1
located on the island 's southeast side , the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock			2
many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems			0
residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones			1
preparations sporadic suspensions in the lava 's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway			1
