@entity0 and @entity1 could n't be separated in the first leg of their @entity4 quarter - final showdown on tuesday			1
the two giants from the @entity7 capital played out a goalless draw , meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the @entity11			2
here , @entity12 rates the players in the first leg of the @entity4 quarter - final at the @entity16			1
@entity0 @entity18 9 - blocked everything in the first half as a wind - assisted @entity1 looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes			1
had less to do in the second half but did it well			0
a man of the match display from the 22 - year - old			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity18 made a big save to deny @entity27 in the early minutes @entity28 7 - he was rattled , along with the rest of the team , in the first half but he played his part in keeping @entity0 at bay			1
@entity34 not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside @entity37 - that is the third time this season real have failed to score against @entity0 at the @entity16 and @entity34 is a major reason for that			1
@entity37 7 - a rare slip early on let @entity27 in but the @entity43 failed to punish the @entity44 and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the @entity47 champions			1
at times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in @entity51 but came through without conceding			0
@entity0 centre - back @entity37 rises higher than @entity52 to attempt a header on goal @entity55 6 - no mystery why @entity57 wants @entity58 back at the club next season			1
@entity61 is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer			0
@entity64 7 - always bright going forward and tested @entity65 in the second period with a shot the @entity69 keeper did well to save			0
will be vital in nicking a goal at the @entity71 next week			0
@entity72 6 - forced a fine second - half save from @entity65 but was just as blown away by @entity1 in the first 45 minutes			1
will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if , as expected , he moves on			0
@entity79 's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as @entity0 took the initiative			1
@entity84 is crowded out by @entity0 's @entity72 ( left ) and @entity85 @entity86 6 - currently struggling to live up to those ' new @entity88 ' tags			1
still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against @entity1 's trio of @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity95 7 - you can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games			0
he is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from @entity52			0
tough to play against and he will be important for @entity0 on the break at the @entity71			2
@entity104 7 - the old warhorse was elbowed by @entity52 , bitten and punched by @entity106 and booked for complaining			0
he was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half			0
still lacks that pace to pull away into space that @entity110 has			0
substitutes : @entity112 ( @entity95 77 ) , @entity113 ( @entity86 83 )			0
not used : @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118			0
@entity1 @entity65 7 - stayed awake in the first half as @entity1 poured forward but @entity0 still threatened on the break			1
also kept out @entity72 ' late shot as @entity1 managed to hang on			2
@entity65 makes a save as @entity0 striker @entity113 goes for the ball @entity106 7 - was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as @entity1 tried to take advantage of @entity55 ’s weakness			1
also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on @entity129 as tempers frayed			0
that might still cost him his place in the second leg			0
@entity136 8 - @entity1 's best performer			1
we knew he was quick but how quick ! his first half sprint down the right was worthy of @entity27			2
is there a quicker defender in @entity142 at the moment ? quite possibly not			0
when @entity145 pulled out before the start of the game many @entity1 fans would have feared the worst but @entity136 never put a foot wrong			1
@entity136 was in excellent form for @entity1 in defence at the @entity16 @entity52 6 - left trailing in @entity95 ’s wake early on but was a match for @entity104			1
solid but without the heroics of @entity51 and that last - minute goal			2
@entity155 7 - asked to attack less in the first half with @entity106 trying to do more damage on the other flank			0
did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do			0
booked and will not play second leg			0
@entity92 7 - majestic in the first half as @entity0 dominated but faded like his team in the second			2
still the most complete midfielder that @entity1 have and they were never going to lose 4 - 0 as they did in february without him			1
he will be vital in the second leg			0
@entity92 was majestic in the first half for @entity1 , but he faded along with the team in the second @entity94 6 - a shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as @entity0 ’s holder			1
covered ground , got @entity1 passing and still managed a shot that @entity18 saved , but would n't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward ? @entity178 6 - only just back from injury and it showed in the second half			1
could easily have made way for @entity183 , who eventually replaced @entity184			2
has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but could n't take it			0
@entity27 7 - provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented @entity55 but they came to nothing and @entity1 were left to rue the chance he had when @entity37 slipped and he was through on @entity18 ’s goal			1
he will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with @entity0 's weakness at left back			2
@entity27 missed an excellent opportunity to give @entity1 the lead and a priceless away goal @entity201 to score against @entity0 and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard			1
missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards @entity84 instead of trying to beat @entity18 himself			2
@entity84 6 - had several free - kicks in the first half that failed to trouble @entity18 , also failed to connect with those excellent first - half crosses from @entity27			1
@entity0 are a tough nut to crack and the world ’s most expensive forward line could n’t find the vital away goal			2
@entity84 was just as responsible as @entity27 and @entity184 for that			1
substitutes : @entity218 ( @entity106 85 ) , @entity183 ( @entity184 76 )			2
not used : @entity219 , @entity145 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222			0
@entity84 endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team			0

@entity0 and @entity1 draw 0 - 0 at @entity16
@entity18 was excellent in goal for @entity0 to keep @entity1 at bay
@entity27 had a huge chance to score an away goal for @entity1
@entity136 was @entity1 's best player in defence
@entity184 's struggles against @entity0 continued
