they have been credited for inspiring some of the most popular songs of a generation			0
now scientists claim they are closer to understanding why magic mushrooms cause people to have such intense creative and spiritual experiences			1
scans have revealed that its active ingredient , psilocybin , creates a hyperconnected mind that links regions of the brain that are normally have nothing to do with each other			1

on the left is how a brain under placebo appears this triggers vivid hallucinations , often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects			1
the increased brain activity could also be responsible for synaesthesia - the phenomenon where different senses are associated with others , according to @entity34 scientists			1
some magic mushroom users have , for instance , reported tasting colours , seeing noises or feeling smells			0
' [ users ] report it as one of the most profound experiences they 've had in their lives , even comparing it to the birth of their children , ' study co-author @entity40 , a physicist at @entity41 , told @entity50			1

' [ users ] report it as one of the most profound experiences they 've had in their lives , even comparing it to the birth of their children , ' said study co-author @entity40 , a physicist at @entity41 professor expert compared @entity61 images of the brains of placebo - takers and the brains of mushroom - takers , and found they were significantly different			2
according to his study , the brains of drug - takers featured a host of regional links not usually created during normal brain activity			1
professor expert said the study could help them understand the usefulness of psilocybin in treating disorders like depression			1
they also believe their study in brain connectivity could lead to answers for other long - standing questions in science			1
long time smokers were more successful in kicking the habit when taking magic mushrooms quitting smoking is a goal that many fail to achieve			0
but a study has found that long time smokers were more successful in kicking the habit when taking psilocybin - the active hallucinogenic agent in ' magic mushrooms '			1
the controlled experiment found that 80 per cent of participants successfully quit after six months			0
the research was carried out by the @entity100 in @entity101			0
in the study ten men and five women , all mentally and physically healthy , took part			2
each had smoked an average of 19 cigarettes a day for 31 years but had repeatedly tried to quit , without success			0
each participant was given a dose of psilocybin in pill form on a day they planned to quit smoking			2
two and eight weeks later they were then given higher doses of the drug			0
each drug - taking session lasted six to seven hours , during which they were kept in a safe and comfortable setting			0
they often wore eyeshades and listened to music while being told to relax			0
in addition they undertook weekly counselling and kept a diary to monitor their cravings			0
by the end of the study 12 of the 15 participants were able to quit smoking completely			2
the researchers add that the experiment is not an endorsement for taking magic mushrooms , but rather highlights how psilocybin can be useful in controlled environments			2
' the big question in neuroscience is where consciousness comes from , ' co-author @entity146 , a mathematician at @entity148 's @entity147 , told @entity149			2
' we do n't know			2
' a separate study earlier this year revealed incredible similarities with brains scanned while a person is dreaming and those who had taken magic mushrooms			0
@entity157 was found to increase activity in the parts of the more primitive parts of the brain linked to emotional thinking , prompting several regions to become active at once			1
however , volunteers who had taken the drug showed ' uncoordinated ' activity in those areas of the brain linked to high - level thinking , including self - consciousness			1
magic mushrooms vivid hallucinations , often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects			0
some users report having spiritual experiences ' what we have done in this research is begin to identify the biological basis of the reported mind expansion associated with psychedelic drugs , ' said dr @entity184 from the @entity185 , @entity186			0
' people often describe taking psilocybin as producing a dreamlike state and our findings have , for the first time , provided a physical representation for the experience in the brain			1
' one particular network that was especially affected plays a central role in the brain , essentially ' holding it all together ' and is linked to our sense of self			0
in comparison , activity in the different areas of a more primitive brain network became more synchronised under the drug , indicating they were working in a more coordinated , ' louder ' fashion .			1

active *chemical* , psilocybin , causes *dramatic* increase in brain activity
it links up regions of the brain that do n't normally talk to each other
this may be responsible for synaesthesia , the phenomenon whereby different senses are mixed up with others , according to @entity34 scientists
study could uncover usefulness of psilocybin in treating depression
it may also address issues such as where consciousness comes from
