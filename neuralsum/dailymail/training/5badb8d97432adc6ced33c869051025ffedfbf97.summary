finally : a settlement has been reached over the $ 300 million estate of late heiress , @entity3 the vicious battle over the $ 300 million estate of late copper heiress @entity3 has been settled out of court at the eleventh hour - leaving her faithful nurse with nothing			1
the 40 - page settlement was signed moments before jury selection was to begin on tuesday and the judge in @entity13 in @entity14 accepted the deal , ruling out a trial			0
@entity17 , who was the daughter of former @entity19 senator @entity17 , died aged 104 in may 2011 and 19 of her distant relatives have been battling over the fortune ever since			1
@entity17 had written two wills in 2005 and the relatives claimed she was not lucid when she wrote the second , which cut them out			0
today 's settlement combines elements from the two contradictory wills			0
the family - many of whom @entity17 never even met - came out as the winners , receiving $ 34 million while her private nurse of 20 years , @entity34 , was left with nothing			1
@entity34 , an immigrant from the @entity37 who worked 12 hours a day , seven days a week for @entity17 as she lived in @entity39 hospitals , had originally been given $ 30 million in @entity17 's final will			1
@entity34 had also been given $ 30 million in gifts throughout @entity17 's life			1
a separate deal ordered her to pay $ 5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general 's office deemed them excessive			1
however , the settlement stops @entity17 's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts , @entity46 reported			1
cut out : @entity34 worked as @entity17 's nurse for 20 years and was left $ 30 million in her final will - but the settlement says that she will now receive none of this and must return $ 5 million worth of gifts the gifts included multiple @entity14 apartments and a $ 1.2 million stradivarius violin			1
her primary doctor also received cash @entity58 presents totaling $ 500,000 , among other gifts			0
@entity34 's attorney , @entity61 , read a statement after the settlement emerged , reading : ' the @entity34 family is very happy to contribute to the settlement of the litigations involving madame @entity17 in the hope that it will allow madame @entity17 to retain whatever privacy that she has left			2
' the @entity34 family was blessed to have met madame @entity17 and she will always be in their thoughts and prayers			2
' the relatives who were arguing for the money are the great - grandchildren and great - great - grandchildren of @entity3 's father from his first marriage			2
they do not need to pay legal fees in the case as the estate will cover the $ 11.5 million cost			0

the relatives who argued for the fortune are the great - grandchildren and great - great - grandchildren of @entity3 's father from his first marriage the 40 - page settlement that was accepted in @entity14 's @entity13 on tuesday combines elements from @entity3 's two wills from 2005 and includes : $ 34.5 million for @entity17 's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress $ 11.5 million for the relatives ' legal fees $ 85 million home in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity17 's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation , the @entity103 , which was set up by the will $ 4.5 million cash for the art foundation $ 1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation $ 3.5 million for @entity17 's goddaughter , @entity109 , who wrote to her throughout her life $ 10 million for the @entity112 in @entity113 $ 1 million for the @entity114 , where @entity17 lived for 20 years $ 0 for @entity34 , the private nurse who had originally been in line for $ 30 million			1
she must also pay back $ 5 million in gifts $ 0 for @entity17 's attorney , @entity118 , and her accountant , @entity120 , who had been in line for $ 500,000 the settlement also sets up an arts foundation that will control the @entity17 family 's $ 85 million summer home in @entity99 , @entity100 - making it the will 's largest beneficiary , as @entity17 had wished			1
but rather than being set up in @entity100 , as she had asked , the foundation will in fact be in @entity39			0
seats are reserved for the @entity99 community and @entity17 's relatives			2
her attorney , @entity118 , and her accountant , @entity120 , will also get nothing after originally receiving $ 500,000 in the will and will no longer be executors of her estate , which would have paid each around $ 3 million , @entity46 reported			2
a criminal investigation of @entity17 's finances found there was no reason to charge either with a crime but the deal does allow the family to sue the duo , who were suspended from their posts for allegedly wasting her assets , for malpractice			2
others will receive the amount dictated by the final will , including @entity17 's doctor , @entity157 , who will receive $ 100,000 , her goddaughter , @entity109 , who will receive $ 3.5 million , and @entity17 's personal assistant , @entity160 , who will receive $ 500,000			1
tuesday 's settlement drew an appeal from one group that was cut out of the negotiations , meaning it could have to be redrawn , but by accepting it , the judge warded off an eight - week trial			0
the first will drawn up in 2005 , when she was 98 , left $ 5 million to her nurse and the rest to her relatives			1
the second , more detailed will , drawn six weeks later , cut out her relatives entirely			0
estate : 19 fought for a share of @entity17 's lavish $ 300 million estate			1
pictured , inside her @entity14 home the relatives had said that a coterie of hospital executives , medical professionals and @entity17 's lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded , aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars			1
but the beneficiaries had argued that @entity17 was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her			0
@entity17 's father , @entity19 sen. @entity17 , was one of the richest @entity19 of the late 19th and early 20th centuries			2

his business empire later grew to include building a @entity198 rail line and establishing a @entity200 railroad town called @entity201			0
the surrounding @entity202 is named for him			0
settled : the settlement was accepted by a judge at @entity14 's @entity13 on tuesday @entity17 owned lavish properties from @entity39 's @entity206 to the @entity100 coast but opted to spend her last 20 years in a @entity14 hospital			2
while she stayed at the hospital , her three fabulous homes sat empty : the $ 100million @entity103 estate , a $ 24million country house in @entity86 and a $ 100million co-op , the largest apartment on @entity206 overlooking @entity217			0
