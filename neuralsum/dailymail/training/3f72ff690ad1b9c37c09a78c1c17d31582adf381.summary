by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 29 september 2012 updated : 18:34 est , 29 september 2012 the golden years were shaping up nicely for accountant @entity2			1
the 67 - year - old retiree had several boats and a waterfront vacation home at central @entity7 's @entity6			1
he could jet off to a winter getaway on @entity11 's @entity10 , and had plenty of money in the bank after a career preparing taxes and renting out downtown office space in @entity18 , a country town 15 miles north of @entity20			2
they never got the chance			0
in october 2010 , an intruder shot the couple in their lake home , killing @entity40 and leaving @entity41 note critically wounded with a gunshot wound to the head			1
he died four days later , after his daughter told doctors that he would prefer to die rather than be kept alive by medical intervention			2
what happened next set the stage for a unique legal case : @entity2 's daughter , @entity50 , was accused by prosecutors of pulling the trigger and forging her father 's signature on the document doctors relied on to end his medical treatment			1
the case , which essentially accuses her of ' death by forgery , ' has captivated the small @entity7 community since her september arrest			0
legal experts say it 's a case with little , if any , precedent			2
' he died as a result of them removing life support , not as a result of the gunshot , ' @entity66 prosecutor @entity65 said			0
' if you commit a felony , and somebody dies as a result , there is a criminal responsibility for that death			0
' @entity79 , who goes by @entity80 , is a 44 - year - old attorney who specializes in end - of - life issues , and advertised herself for offering ' compassionate representation of clients			1
' deadly intent : @entity85 , 44 , is accused of forging her father 's signature to make herself a durable power of attorney so she could pull the plug on him days after just barely surviving the shooting she 's jailed on a $ 1 million cash bond , facing charges of felony forgery and first - degree murder			1
she has pleaded not guilty , and if convicted could face a lengthy jail sentence or the death penalty			0
she has not been charged in the death of her father 's girlfriend ; prosecutors say they are pursuing the cases separately			1
friends of both victims and the suspect describe a troubled father - daughter relationship weakened by the divorce of @entity85 's parents three decades ago			1
the couple had two children , but @entity111 's only son and namesake died as a teenager			1
they are now buried next to each other			0
but the relationship appeared to have recovered somewhat , at least enough that @entity2 felt comfortable letting his daughter handle some of his affairs			1
@entity118 , who lived with her mother and teenage son in the @entity20 suburb of @entity123 after a 2006 divorce , helped her father manage his commercial rental properties on @entity18 's historic downtown square , said floral shop owner @entity128 , a @entity2 tenant			1
@entity2 built his payroll and accounting businesses from modest beginnings , said @entity133 , a retired airline mechanic in @entity20 who first started getting his taxes done by @entity2 more than four decades ago , when @entity2 's office was in a basement			1
@entity2 's jovial demeanour did n't fit his profession 's buttoned - down stereotype , according to @entity141			2
estate : one of @entity144 's lavish lakeside homes is seen with the accountant leaving behind a $ 1.6 million estate that would have benefited his long - time girlfriend if she had survived ' income tax season is n't always the happiest time of the year , ' he said			1
' but he 'd always make you feel better when you walked out of his office			0
he was just an all - around , good - natured guy			0
i 've never seen him down			0
' @entity2 had sold several of his businesses years ago , but continued to work during tax season when not vacationing at the lake or his home in @entity159 , @entity11 , @entity128 said			2
his daughter , meanwhile , was struggling to make ends meet			0
records reviewed by @entity0 show that @entity118 filed for bankruptcy in federal court in september 2009			0
she listed $ 254 , 938 in assets and $ 374,072.86 in debt owed to 10 creditors , including @entity168 , @entity169 and a children 's hospital			2
she 'd previously worked for @entity171 before attending law school , and listed a monthly income around $ 3,300			0
when the shooting happened , fearful friends and neighbours initially wondered whether the crime was committed by a pro. the crime scene was clean and there were no signs of forced entry into the home			0
some whispered that the assailant might have gotten away by boat			0
@entity65 , who is prosecuting the case , declined to discuss whether @entity118 's alleged forgery was premeditated , or a response to her father 's unexpected survival from the attack			1
prosecutors have also declined to discuss specific evidence about the shooting			0
but they have said that @entity118 enlisted a high school classmate and her spouse , @entity196 and @entity197 of @entity198 , @entity199 , to act as witnesses to the forged documents			0
accused : @entity2 is pictured left of @entity197 and @entity203 , who prosecutors say aided in the couple 's killing the @entity208 were indicted on felony forgery and second - degree murder charges ; they have pleaded not guilty and their attorney , @entity212 , says they are ' going to be vindicated			1
' the document she 's accused of forging is known as a durable power of attorney			1
people can use a power of attorney to dictate whom they want making medical decisions for them in emergencies or if they are near death and unable to speak for themselves			2
@entity40 was slated to inherit @entity2 's cash and several homes			2
but her death would have likely meant that @entity2 's daughter would get most of the estate 's proceeds , which were likely worth millions of dollars more than the partial estimate on file			1
@entity111 's estate was valued at $ 1.6 million			1
the will leaves @entity2 's personal property , such as cars , jewelry and furniture , to his daughter , along with life insurance proceeds and the three rental properties in @entity18			1
four months after her father 's death , the @entity11 home was sold by @entity118 for $ 238,000 , records show			1
three days after her arrest , @entity40 's adult son filed a court petition to remove @entity118 as the principal beneficiary and will executor , citing the criminal cases			0
@entity128 , the tenant who knew @entity2 , said that his daughter 's arrest did n't come as a surprise to many in @entity18			1
' it happened on a saturday , and she unplugged him on wednesday , ' @entity128 said			0
' a lot of people did not understand that			0
' legal experts said the prosecution 's unusual strategy could make obtaining a murder conviction more difficult			2
' if this is all they have to go on , it 's pretty thin , ' said @entity269 law professor @entity268 , a former public defender who represented accused murderer @entity270 after the april 1995 bombing of the @entity273 federal building			2
' maybe the prosecution 's got more ( evidence )			0
but by itself , it seems they 've got a lot of work ahead			0
' watch the video here :			0
