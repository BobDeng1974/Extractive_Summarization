goats are known to eat just about anything , but it did n't dawn on @entity3 until recently that the menu might include @entity6 trees			1
' they 'll eat the pine needles and leave the skeleton of the tree , ' said @entity3 , a longtime volunteer firefighter who has come up with a new use for his family - owned goat herding business , ' @entity14			2
' ' it basically looks like @entity16 's @entity6 with a scrawny tree that has nothing but the branches , ' he told the @entity20			2
yummy snack : these several goats owned by @entity3 , founder of @entity14 , who along with his 40 goats are teaming up with the @entity24 to help recycle @entity6 trees @entity3 is launching a new program with the @entity24 on friday to use his 40 goats to help recycle @entity6 trees			1

let them eat trees ! : @entity3 , founder of @entity14 , pets his goat @entity46 after feeding her a pine tree in @entity48 on tuesday , dec. 23 , 2015			1
@entity3 and the 40 goats he owns are teaming up with the @entity24 to help recycle @entity6 trees and keep them out of landfills			1
( @entity51 photo / @entity20 , @entity52 ) ' we thought , " what a great way to get rid of the weeds , " ' he said			0
' we had the idea of doing just that with the recycling program and we thought about the trees			0
' and the goats are great employees , they love their job and they do n't complain			0
' @entity3 said he noticed not long ago that no weeds were growing at his daughter 's home in @entity67 northeast of @entity48 where she raises rabbits , pigs and goats			1

they ate every single weed in our yard , ' he said			0

' i did a lot of research on that , and it 's ok for the goats , ' @entity3 said			1
' with cattle and some of the other animals , it can cause miscarriages			0
but for goats , it 's a natural dewormer , and pine is very high in vitamin c , so it 's healthy for them			1
' keep @entity101 is among a number of groups in the area that recycle trees and are glad to have the help from the goats			0
' a lot of people dump it out on the desert and that 's really a problem because people think it 's a natural thing and it will decompose , ' said @entity116 , communications manager for the group that has been chopping recycled trees into mulch for 24 years			2
' but because we 're out in the desert , they do n't decompose , it will just get drier and drier and it really becomes a serious fire hazard			0

' for goats , it 's a natural dewormer , and pine is very high in vitamin c , so it 's healthy for them , ' @entity3 said of the health *benefits*
trees that are n't disposed of properly *dry* up in the desert and become a hazard
