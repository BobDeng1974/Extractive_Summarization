forget the soft approach , ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male - dominated industries , according to a controversial study			2
the advice was given by female psychologist , @entity6 , who claims women applicants should ' play up their masculine qualities ' in job interviews professor @entity6 of @entity22 conducted an experiment with volunteers for the research journal @entity26			1
she asked women to apply for leadership roles in male - dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates ' suitability			2
some of the women were asked to emphasise supposed masculine - like traits such as assertiveness , independence and raw ambition			1
others were asked to display more feminine traits , in this case defined as warmth , supportiveness and a nurturing nature			1
as part of the tests , the panel - irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it - decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process professor @entity55 said : ' we found that manning up seemed to be an effective strategy because it was seen as necessary for the job			1
' the panel , irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it , decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process			1
the study is part of professor @entity55 's research into why women , ethnic minorities , the disable and the elderly are discriminated against in society and what they can do to avoid it			2
though it may seem wrong for women to act like men in order to succeed			0
professor @entity55 said it may help candidates overcome an obvious bias in the very early stages or recruitment			0
she said : ' companies and recruiters should make sure they are not exhibiting discriminatory screening practices			1
' there 's a lot of advice out there for applicants to help combat this type of bias , but our research is aimed at figuring out what kind of advice is beneficial and what kind of advice may harm you			0
' the amount of women in executive positions at @entity106 companies has remained at a dismal 15 per cent			0
only last month @entity108 investigator @entity107 declared that the @entity109 has a ‘ boys ' club sexist culture ’ with sexism work in @entity109 than any other place			0
part of the problem , according to psychologists , is that many men are in fact ‘ secret feminists ’ but are afraid to speak up because their motives may be misread			0
@entity122 , a professor of psychology at the @entity123 , highlights the fact that in conversation about women in leadership , male voices are noticeably absent			0
for instance , of @entity129 ’s 100 top - selling books this week about women and business , only four were written by men			0
‘ some men want to voice their support , but fear that no one will take them seriously , because they lack a vested interest in the cause , ’ professor @entity122 writes in the @entity134			1
but is this just an excuse ? ‘ i do n’t think so , ’ said professor @entity122			0
‘ there ’s evidence that when a cause seems inconsistent with our self - interest , we fear that we ’ll incur a backlash , so we hold back			0

this is according to experiments conducted at @entity22
recruiters , they say , prefer assertiveness , independence and ambition
they rate these traits higher than warmth , support and nurturing qualities
