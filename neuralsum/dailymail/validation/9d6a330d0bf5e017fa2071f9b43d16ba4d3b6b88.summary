@entity1 boss @entity0 has vowed to stand by @entity2 as the striker bids to end a six - year goal drought for his country			1
the @entity6 forward , a £ 14million player , scored his only international goal in a 2 - 1 @entity10 qualifying win over @entity11 in april 2009			1
missing from the @entity1 set - up for 19 months under former manager @entity13 , the 28 - year - old ’s record now stands at one goal in 19 caps after wednesday night ’s friendly win over @entity19			1
striker @entity2 has scored just one goal for @entity1 in 19 appearances a home @entity23 qualifier with @entity25 minnows @entity26 offers the chance to put that right on sunday and @entity0 believes one may be enough to set his first - choice striker scoring again			1
‘ there was a lovely movement from @entity2 and link - up play ( against @entity19 ) , ’ said the manager			1
‘ all his game is needing is a goal			1
‘ but i do n’t think it ’s affecting his touch or his willingness to work - you see him sliding into tackles and making blocks			1
‘ if you do n’t have your goalscoring boots on then you dig in and do something else for the team			2
i ’m happy with that			2
‘ he is terrific to watch			2
i think he is elegant , i think he ’s clever , he brings people into play			2
you can trust him when the ball goes up so we can then get up beside him			2
@entity2 's goal drought continued in wednesday night ’s friendly win over @entity19 ‘ but i would like to see more people round about him			1
‘ in the first half against @entity19 , i did n’t think we had enough people in the box			2
‘ we played too much around the edge of the box , so i would like to see more bodies in there			0
in saying that , we do n’t have a @entity66 or a @entity67 who comes in off the line			0
’ @entity2 has found it difficult scoring goals for relegation threatened @entity6 as well , claiming four in 28 appearances this season			1
‘ he a good player , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ but as i said , you do n’t have to be scoring goals as long as your team is winning			0
so i ’m fine with that			0
@entity2 ( left ) celebrates scoring against @entity11 with @entity79 at @entity80 in 2009 ‘ i went to bed fine on wednesday night because the team was winning and making chances			1
’ defender @entity84 has scored three goals in the period since @entity2 struck against @entity11 , adding his latest goal on wednesday night			1
‘ funnily enough , when we put @entity84 on we knew that he had scored a few goals this season so he came up with another one , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ i felt pleased for him because he has been to all the get - togethers and not played - so we had to get him on the pitch to make all of his travels previously worthwhile			2
’ @entity84 is unlikely to start against @entity26 , with @entity0 set to name his strongest side after vowing to treat sunday ’s opponents with respect			1
‘ we ’ve got to , ’ he said			0
‘ but our players would n’t have got to where they are by taking shortcuts			0
‘ you just had to watch their intensity in training on tuesday when they were playing amongst themselves to see their hard work			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes one may be enough to set @entity2 scoring again ‘ you do n’t get to where they are by taking people for granted			1
that just wo n’t happen			0
‘ you can be rest assured that wo n’t happen			0
’ @entity26 have yet to win @entity113 recognition and , after battling for access to @entity115 , shipped 21 goals in their four qualifiers so far - losing two of their games 7 - 0			1
cautioning against expectations of a rout , however , @entity0 added : ‘ the world champions only beat @entity26 4 - 0			1
‘ i ca n’t tell our fans how to behave			0
i ’ve said already , i ’d imagine we ’ll get about three minutes before they get anxious			0
‘ that ’s just the way we are , everybody is like that			0
there is not a problem , we all come along to games and get anxious			0
‘ as long as the players do n’t get anxious , that ’s the main thing			0
‘ but as i say , when it was @entity135 , it was only four goals			0
