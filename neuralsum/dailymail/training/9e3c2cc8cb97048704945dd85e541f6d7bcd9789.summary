by @entity0 scientists have discovered ' enormous ' fossilised sperm dating back 17 million years			2
belonging to a tiny shrimp , the sperm , when uncoiled , was longer than the crustacean 's entire body			0
the preserved semen were discovered at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , and are the oldest ever found			1
@entity11 's oldest : the world 's oldest fossilised sperm has been discovered coiled up inside a tint shrimp			0
this image is a cross-section of 17 million year old fossil ostracod sperm			0
the nuclei in each sperm ( dark spot ) are indicated by arrows the giant sperm are thought to have been longer than the length of the creature ’s body but are tightly coiled up inside the sexual organs of the fossilised freshwater crustaceans , which are known as ostracods			1
‘ these are the oldest fossilised sperm ever found in the geological record , ’ said professor @entity29 , of the @entity30 ’ @entity31 , @entity11 and @entity32			2
he has been excavating at @entity36 for more than 35 years			0
‘ the @entity36 fossil deposits in remote north - western @entity9 have been the site of the discovery of many extraordinary prehistoric @entity10 animals , such as giant , toothed platypuses and flesh - eating kangaroos			1
so we have become used to delightfully unexpected surprises in what turns up there			0
an artist 's impression of the site 17 million years ago			2
the cave was in the middle of a rainforest in an area that is now part of the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
tiny ostracods lived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats ‘ but the discovery of fossil sperm , complete with sperm nuclei , was totally unexpected			1
it now makes us wonder what other types of extraordinary preservation await discovery in these deposits			0
’ a research team from the university collected the fossil ostracods from the @entity74 at @entity36 in 1988			0
they were sent to @entity76 , a specialist ostracod researcher at @entity77 in @entity78 who realised they contained fossilised soft tissues			1
experts including dr @entity82 from @entity83 , who authored the study published in the journal @entity86 , examined the specimens at the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90			0
the microscopic study revealed the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods , including their sexual organs			1
this is a sketch of a male ostracod , showing the organisation and orientation of the reproductive system the creature 's zenker organs - muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female - were preserved			1
' c ' shows a scanning electron microscopic image of @entity36 fossil ostracod on its left side , 'd ' shows one of the creature 's zenker organs and ' e ' shows details of the zenker organ , including its chitinous rings marked as ( cr ) the microscopic study revealed that the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods , including their sexual organs			1
within these are the almost perfectly preserved giant sperm cells and within them , the nuclei that once contained the animals ' chromosomes and @entity124			0
the creature ’s zenker organs – muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female – were also preserved			0
the researchers estimate that the fossilised sperm are about 1.3 millimetres long , which is about the same length or slightly longer than the ostracod itself			0
‘ about 17 million years ago , @entity74 was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest			2
tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats , ’ professor @entity29 explained			1

the site of the fossil cave is pictured professor @entity151 , a specialist in extinct bats and their ecological role in @entity36 's ancient environments at the university , believes that the bats could have played a role in the preservation of the ostracod sperm cells			2
the steady rain of faeces from thousands of bats in the cave would have led to high levels of phosphorous in the water , which could have aided mineralisation of the soft tissues			1
‘ this amazing discovery at @entity36 is echoed by a few examples of soft - tissue preservation in fossil bat - rich deposits in @entity90			0
so the key to eternal preservation of soft tissues may indeed be some magic ingredient in bat droppings , ’ professor @entity169 said			2
@entity36 has previously revealed insects with internal muscles that have been preserved because bacteria became fossilised as they attempted to consume the soft tissues of the creatures			1
perfectly preserved cells of leaves have been found , as well as the preserved soft tissue of eyeballs in the eye sockets of some of the extinct marsupials			0

a specimen of the modern @entity10 ostracod @entity205 is pictured			0

tiny ostracod lived *17million* years ago and *measured* around 1.3mm long
experts from the @entity30 found the fossils at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10
fossils contain preserved internal organs of the ostracods , including their sexual organs - with the sperm coiled up inside
the *small* ostracods lived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats
high levels of phosphorous in the water could have aided mineralisation of the soft tissues , explaining why the fossils are so well preserved
