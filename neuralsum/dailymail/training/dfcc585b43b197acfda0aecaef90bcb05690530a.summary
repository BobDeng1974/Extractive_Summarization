by @entity0 it is well known that @entity2 is a continent of wild contrasts - from the vast plains with countless types of flora and fauna to the harsh conditions of the arid deserts where only the most hardy can survive			1
together they provide the perfect backdrop for this stunning set of images put together by wildlife photographer @entity14			1
some creatures do their best to stay hidden - such as the incredibly well - camouflaged gaboon viper and leaf - tailed gecko			1
mr @entity14 battled his way through his native @entity2 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 in order to capture enough images to publish his new collection entitled @entity19			2
the 41 - year - old said he also learned some lessons about the power of the natural world after being bitten by a mosquito - and almost died from malaria			1
after recovering he was then confronted by a hippo during a canoe trip while on a safari			0
but the former civil engineer pulled through the drama to make sure he finished his book			0
taken over a number of years , the collection includes a chameleon sticking its tongue out , a lion licking its paw and an incredibly well - camouflaged @entity72 hidden among leaves			1
spit and polish : a lion licks its toes in @entity78 in @entity2 beautiful : a lion gazes up as a bird of prey passes overhead in @entity2 hidden : a gaboon viper conceals itself brilliantly in @entity84 , @entity2 mr van den berg , who estimates just one image in every 1000 he took made it into the book , said : ' it is sometimes the most trivial animal that can be the most dangerous			1
' a tiny mosquito almost took my life , which was by far the most dangerous encounter i had			0
' the images for the book were taken over many years			2
you can not go out to photograph specifically for this kind of book			0
artistic images come with time			0
' menacing : a crocodile covered in green algae snapped in @entity48 caught in the web : a spider pictured in its its natural habitat in @entity104 , @entity2 vibrant : mating grasshoppers display incredible their colours in @entity2 determined : photographer @entity108 overcame rhino attacks and an almost deadly bout of malaria to take theses stunning shots a real buzz : @entity108 pictured these honey bees hard at work in @entity2 stunning : a web - footed gecko patrols the desert in @entity49 , left , and a pair of giraffes in perfect symmetry , right captured : a white egret sits on top of a hippo , left , and a leaf - tailed gecko remains well hidden , right ' the leaf - tailed gecko on the tree was difficult to find			1
they are exceptionally hard to spot on the trees of @entity51 , but fortunately i had a good guide who easily spotted them			0
' he added : ' after doing a few books focusing on animal behaviour , i decided to do a book with images only focusing on beauty and the elements of art ' it is difficult to estimate the miles , but if i had known how long it would take to get these images , i would probably not have attempted the project in the first place			0
' in total i visited five countries			0
but some of these have worlds inside them when it comes to wildlife photography opportunities			2
