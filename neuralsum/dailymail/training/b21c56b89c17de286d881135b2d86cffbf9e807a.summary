by @entity0 @entity1 has vowed to end her injury nightmare and make up for lost time next year after a niggling foot injury spoiled her summer			1
the heptathlete was ready to make a huge impression on the world stage after securing a personal best of 6,682 points in july – a world - leading - score in 2014			1
but she never got the chance to turn that blistering form into medals , sustaining a ' stress reaction ' in her foot which forced her to sit on the sidelines for eight weeks			2
' everything 's fine , it 's been okay since day two ( of the injury ) , i have n't felt anything so i do n't feel like an injured athlete , which is annoying , ' said @entity1 , who was speaking at the 2014 @entity38 in @entity39			1
' it was just the worst time possible – if it was the start of the year i could have recovered from it and just plodded on with my season , but it was over two major championships which is the annoying thing			2
' i think it will help me next to year to train harder and come back with a vengeance			0
i think everything was going too well in a sense and when i 'm back on the track , it 'll help me to grasp every opportunity			0
focused : @entity1 wants to make up for the lost time caused by her foot injury role model : @entity1 held a long jump and high jump masterclass for young athletes ' this is the time all athletes should be resting but now i 'm so focused , so it 's definitely going to be a blessing in disguise			1
' and next year could prove just the tonic for @entity1 ahead of the @entity61 in 2016 , as the @entity62 in @entity63 loom next august			1
' i watched the @entity28 and after that i decided i could n't ( watch ) the @entity65 , so that was me done watching athletics this summer , ' she added			1
' it was very hard for me to watch an event you feel you 're at your peak at and feel you 're in really good shape			0
it 's very hard to sit on the couch and watch it , so i kept busy			2
' my next big event is the @entity65 in march			0
i will be pretty much doing everything the same in training throughout winter ( to prepare )			0
' the @entity80 , which is supported by @entity82 funding from @entity83 and delivered by the @entity84 , is taking place in venues across @entity39 ( 4 - 7 september 2014 )			0
