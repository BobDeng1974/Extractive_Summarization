' next generation : @entity1 has revealed the new look of its high - tech device @entity2 last week put its controversial eyewear back on sale to the @entity29 public			1
the firm is offering the ' explorer edition ' , the $ 1500 test version of the eyewear , for general sale after an initial 24 hour sale sold out			0
it is believed the firm wants to increase the number of people people using the hardware - and potentially clear its inventory for the ' real ' consumer version			0
the firm announced a 24 hour sale last month after its plans were leaked , and the device sold out within hours			0
today , it reappeared online for sale to anyone if what is described as an ' open beta '			0
so ... we ’d planned to post this next week , but it looks like the cat 's out of the bag now , ' @entity2 said when its previous plans were leaked			1
. ' over the past several months , we ’ve been trying out different ways to expand the explorer program			0
' our explorers are moms , bakers , surgeons , rockers , and each new explorer has brought a new perspective that is making @entity1 better			0
' but every day we get requests from those of you who have n’t found a way into the program yet , and we want your feedback too			0
' so in typical @entity177 fashion , we ’re trying something new			0
' stylish : the frames will be available in a range of colors and will work with prescription glasses those who currently own the device paid $ 1,500 to be part of the development process , exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device			0

reaction to the new design was mixed , with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky			0
@entity2 has come under fire for the unfashionable look of @entity1 , although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses , and partnered with @entity210 to develop fashionable frames			1
the secret document obtained by @entity213 that reveals the plan however , the updates were welcomed by those who have a first - generation device , with comments on its @entity2 + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience			1
one owner , @entity222 , commented : ' my glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because i ca n't hear it well enough ... yay for updates / upgrades !
