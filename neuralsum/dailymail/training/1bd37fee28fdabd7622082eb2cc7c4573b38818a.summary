' i understand , the complainant mr @entity28 , had quite a serious injury on his ear which required four stitches			0

referring to @entity7 he said : ' he comes in and head - butts her at some sort of speed and sends her flying			2
she gets up and kicks the door then two of them come in			0
' there is a melee - that ’s the only way i can describe it			0
' ' it seems clear from the video the person who actually perpetrated in the assault to the girl would have been @entity7			1
but because this man came back in with @entity7 , there is an argument			2
we have all had to opportunity to see the disgraceful display			0
' all the options will be kept open , including immediate custody			0
anyone who saw that recording would be horrified by the events on that day			0
