by @entity0 published : 16:54 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 16:54 est , 2 january 2014 a bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later , a study shows			1
for people under 40 , an attack of the viral infection led to the risk of stroke rising by 74 per cent and a heart attack by 50 per cent			2
older people were less affected , but shingles increased their risk of a heart attack by 10 per cent and of a ‘ mini-stroke ’ or transient ischaemic attack by 15 per cent			2
a bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later , a study shows @entity27 is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox			1
according to the @entity32 , it is estimated that 189,000 adults get shingles in the @entity35 every year			1
after a case of chickenpox , the virus stays dormant in the body but can flare up into shingles in people with a weakened immune system due to age , stress or poor health			1
symptoms include nerve pain and a blistering skin rash			0
the researchers suggest that reactivation of the virus can spread to the arteries , which pushes up the risk of cardiovascular disease			1
the link between shingles and heart problems was found by @entity35 researchers , who studied 106,000 shingles sufferers and 213,200 people of a similar age who did not have shingles			1
records from a gp database were reviewed for an average of six years after diagnosis , up to 24 years			0
the study , published in the online issue of the journal @entity67 , took into account traditional risk factors such as obesity , smoking and high cholesterol			0
study author dr @entity73 , from @entity74 , said : ‘ anyone with shingles , and especially younger people , should be screened for stroke risk factors			0
’ shingles is caused by the same virus as chickenpox , the herpes varicella - zoster virus , and causes a painful rash which develops into itchy blisters			1
it is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it which can also make people feel unwell for several days before any rash appears			0
most people carry the virus dormant after suffering from chickenpox as a child , but it can be reactivated in later life to cause shingles			2
there is currently no cure for the disease and in most cases the painful rash lasts between 7 and 10 days , although it can take two to four weeks to fully heal			0
the disease can also lead to complications such as postherpetic neuralgia , which is when severe nerve pain lasts for more than three months after the rash has gone			0
estimations suggest this affects at least 1 in 10 people with shingles , although it is more common in older people .			0

according to @entity32 - 189,000 adults get shingles in the @entity35 every year
shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox
*experts* say virus can spread to arteries , pushing up heart disease
