@entity0 has held talks with referees ’ chief @entity3 to outline his anger at recent decisions that he feels have cost @entity6 dearly			1
@entity6 ’s manager is not someone who will criticise referees after matches but he has felt the need to speak with @entity3 , the head of the @entity11 , twice in recent weeks , following a @entity13 game against @entity14 and the @entity16 replay against @entity17			1
@entity0 believes @entity18 made a number of errors at the @entity21 on december 6 , when @entity6 lost 1 - 0 , while he was furious with an incident at @entity23 six days ago when @entity24 never gave @entity25 what appeared to be a clear penalty			1
@entity6 manager @entity0 reacts after a decision goes against his side he insists talks with @entity3 have been amicable but @entity0 has vented his frustrations , insisting mistakes – such as @entity34 ’s failure to send off @entity36 ’s @entity35 for a clear elbow on @entity38 – are happening too often			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i have contacted @entity3 about it			1
the two big decisions were against @entity14 really where there is no justification for those big calls – the red card for @entity45 on @entity46 ( that was n’t given ) , the yellow card against @entity49 and the penalty ( that was n’t )			2
‘ the ( @entity25 penalty incident ) at @entity17 is even harder to take because it is the linesman who gives the free - kick and then the referee knows exactly where the action happened			0
we contacted @entity3 , but there 's not much you can do on that			2
the @entity62 , on the touchline , has discussed recent contentious calls with referees ' chief @entity3 ‘ they accept there 's been an honest error made , but there have been too many now			1
referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is			0
' it 's tough to take when you 've got six or seven big calls which did n't go your way and scorelines could have changed			0
’ @entity6 have only won one of their last 12 games			1
they should have too much quality to get dragged into a fight at the bottom of the table and @entity0 wants them to make home form count , starting tonight against @entity90			1
‘ the next nine games we have at @entity92 we can not lose any points , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that is the aim			0
we are going to approach every home game like that			0
we know how difficult @entity90 are			2
@entity97 is going to bring his own stamp on it but they have a very experienced group of players			0
‘ it will be a difficult game , but all the games we will face at @entity92 we just feel we need to find a way to be the favourites and perform in a manner which will get us three points			1
’ @entity97 , meanwhile , insists he has no problem selecting @entity110 against @entity6 despite his conviction for drink driving			2
@entity110 , 21 , was disqualified from driving for a year and given a £ 3,400 fine after admitting the charge on friday and faces internal discipline too			0
but @entity97 will keep faith in his star striker , who has scored six goals in his last three games and 14 for the season , despite insisting @entity90 are not solely dependent on his scoring ability			1
@entity90 striker @entity110 has been linked with the likes of @entity122 and @entity123 this window ‘ he will be in the squad , ’ said @entity97			2
‘ i will have a chat with him if i feel it is necessary and if it ’s not necessary i will leave it			0
he has been a good kid since i walked in through the door			0
he has to make sure he maintains that			0
‘ we have got other players who can score goals , other players who , if we do n’t play @entity110 , will step in and put a shift in			0
‘ it certainly is n’t a one - man team in respect of how young and inexperienced @entity110 is			0
’ @entity90 manager @entity97 will be desperate to keep hold of star striker @entity110			2
