by @entity0 if you love the taste of a beef burger , but hate the thought of killing animals , then you could soon be offered a guilt - free alternative			2
a group of @entity9 scientists has come up with a design for a small - scale factory that could be used to deliver sustainable meat made from stem cells			1
while still a concept , the group have outlined a factory process in which the meat begins its life as a vial of cells and is grown in stages to create minced meat			1
a group of @entity9 scientists has come up with a plan to create small - scale factories that deliver sustainable meat made from stem cells			1
the meat begins its life as a vial of cells taken from a cell bank and is later processed in a bioreactor to create a pressed cake of minced meat the technology has already been proven on an individual scale			1
last year , @entity36 , a professor of tissue engineering at @entity38 , the @entity9 , presented the first lab - grown hamburger			1
however , the design for a larger factory is still at a proof - of - concept stage			2
‘ we believe that cultured meat is part of the future , ’ said @entity43 of @entity44 in @entity9			1
‘ it is highly effective in stimulating a growing awareness and discussion of the problems of meat production and consumption			1
’ rising demand for meat around the world is unsustainable in terms of environmental pollution and energy consumption , experts claim			1
the technology has already been proven on an individual scale			0

to great the burger , stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth , allowing them to proliferate 30-fold			0
next they are combined with an elastic collagen and attached to @entity78 ' anchor points ' in a culture dish			0
between the anchor points , the cells self - organise into chunks of muscle			1
electrical stimulation is then used to make the muscle strips contract and ' bulk up ' - the laboratory equivalent of working out in a gym			0
finally thousands of beef strips are minced up , together with 200 pieces of lab - grown animal fat , and moulded into a patty			1
around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger			0
other non-meat ingredients include salt , egg powder , and breadcrumbs			0
red beetroot juice and saffron are added to provide authentic beef colouring			0
a recent @entity102 report concluded that a global shift toward a vegan diet is necessary to combat the worst effects of climate change			0
and the @entity102 is not alone in its analysis			0
more than 50 per cent or more of global greenhouse - gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture , according to a report published by the @entity111			2
to create culture meat , cells are exponentially grown during each stage by filling the cells with a sterile solution and cultivating them in a nutrient broth			1
next they are combined with a binding protein which allows the cells to self - organise into chunks of muscle			2
the harvested cells are pressed and the cake is made into retailer - size portions of minced meat			1
but there will be challenges when it comes to maintaining a continuous stem cell line and producing cultured meat that 's cheaper than meat obtained in the usual way			1
most likely , the price of ‘ normal ’ meat would first have to rise considerably , professor van der @entity43			0
‘ cultured meat has great moral promise , ’ she added			2
‘ worries about its unnaturalness might be met through small - scale production methods that allow close contact with cell - donor animals			1
‘ from a technological perspective , “ village - scale ” production is also a promising option			2
’ rising demand for meat around the world is unsustainable in terms of environmental pollution and energy consumption			2
more than 50 per cent or more of global greenhouse - gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture , according to a report published by the @entity111 ‘ other parts of the future are partly substituting meat with vegetarian products , keeping fewer animals in better circumstances , perhaps eating insects , ’ she added			1
for instance , a student in @entity167 has created a range of meals based on liquefied and blended insects			0
the @entity173 was designed by graduate @entity174 and during taste tests , diners were none the wiser			0
@entity174 's meals were inspired by a 2013 report by the @entity179 of the @entity102 called @entity180 , which investigated how insects could solve food shortages			0
in february researchers at @entity183 unveiled their sustainable insect snacks			0
made from a mixture of dung beetles , mealworms and crickets , the researchers claimed the snacks could be developed to help feed a growing global population			0
their prototypes were apparently rich in protein and included crunch cinnamon snacks that were 3d - printed using the ground bugs			0
meanwhile , back in october 2013 students at @entity196 were awarded $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 ) to turn insects into flour			0
the goal of the project was to turn this into bread and other foods			0
the project , known as @entity205 , is hoped to provide a sustainable , year - round source of food as well as provide an extra business opportunity for local farmers .			2

the meat begins its life as a vial of cells taken from a cell bank and is later processed in a bioreactor to create a pressed cake of minced meat
scientists at @entity44 hope the cultured burgers will help address the environmental and ethical costs of global meat production
the first lab - grown hamburger was created by @entity9 scientists last year
