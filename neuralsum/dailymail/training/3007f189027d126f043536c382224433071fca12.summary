up to eight officers from @entity7 swooped on the office of @entity9 as part of an ongoing inquiry linked to children ’s homes in the county			1
officers took the highly unusual step of entering @entity17 to raid his office and seize computer equipment just weeks before submitting a dossier on the peer to the @entity23			1
the offices of @entity9 were raided by officers from @entity27 police in march , it has emerged the move came after police spent several days searching the 85 - year - old politician ’s home in @entity32 , north - west @entity33 , in december			1
the widowed father of three , a @entity5 mp in @entity35 from 1970 to 1997 , has not been arrested in connection with the allegations and police have yet to send a full file of evidence to the @entity23			1
but preliminary papers have been served to prosecutors who are advising detectives on the progress of the investigation which started last year after a man came forward claiming he was abused as a teenager in the 1970s by @entity9			2
the probe has been linked to pervert @entity48 , who was found guilty of abusing more than 100 children in the 1970s and 1980s			0
