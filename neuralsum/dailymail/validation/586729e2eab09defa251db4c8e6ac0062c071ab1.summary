a radio dj has spoken of her nightmare being stalked by a man for 13 years - who would call her 66 times an hour and even threatened to throw acid in her face			1
@entity7 became so terrified of her stalker that she began to self - harm and was afraid to go in to work at @entity10 , in @entity11 , alone			1
the 40 - year - old says she finally has her life back after enduring more than a decade of sickening harassment because of stalker @entity15			1
@entity7 ( pictured left and right , at work at @entity10 ) endured ' sheer hell ' thanks to a stalker who harassed her for 13 years			1
stalker @entity15 was detained indefinitely in hospital @entity15 , 55 , was detained in hospital indefinitely last month after judge @entity25 ruled he posed a serious danger to the public and @entity10 station in particular			1
ms @entity7 revealed seeing her stalker in court was only the second time she had seen him in person			1
but during years of what she described as ' sheer hell , ' ms @entity7 said authorities had refused to act because he had never physically attacked her - until last year , when he threatened her with acid attacks and vowed to put her in a wheelchair			1
she said : ' this man has been in my life longer than my own husband			0
it 's a huge weight off my shoulders as i can get on with my life			0
' the calls would range from between 10 to 66 calls every hour			0
i once had 41 calls in 30 minutes			0
ms @entity7 says she became too afraid to go in to work at @entity10 ( pictured ) in @entity11 alone she added : ' i was the only white person working at the station at the time so whether he fixated on that or the fact i was the only one answering i do n't know but it was 13 years of sheer hell			1
' ms @entity7 , from @entity11 , says the abuse started in 2001 after a rival business to @entity15 's was advertised on @entity10			1
after his business went bust , @entity15 appeared to blame the station - and as ms @entity7 was the only person answering the phones at the radio station at the time , she believes this is why he became fixated on her			1
' he became fixated with me , i think , because i was the only one on the phones so he constantly spoke to me when he called , ' she said			0
' i had a police escort one night when i attended an election count for work			0
i did n't want to do my job anymore			0
it was so emotionally draining			0
' @entity15 was jailed in 2004 for a campaign of harassment against a number of people			2
ms @entity7 was a witness in this trial , but she said he blamed his jail sentence entirely on her			1
the jail time failed to deter his actions and after losing his mother early last year , the abuse became more sinister			0
' he threatened to rape me and to kill me , ' she said			2
' he would ring and ask if i could hear anything then i would hear what sounded like the loading of a gun			0
' he even said i was a prostitute and that my boss was my pimp			0
it got so bad that my mum or dad had to take me to work			0
' in march 2014 , he told me he was going to wait for me and throw acid in my face - that was the final straw			2
' @entity15 was found to be mentally unfit to plead a charge of stalking involving fear of violence in november last year - but a jury found he had committed the acts alleged			1
he appeared at @entity98 last month , where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in @entity101 psychiatric hospital			2
@entity15 appeared at @entity98 ( pictured ) last month , where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in @entity101 psychiatric hospital ms @entity7 added : ' i would urge anyone who is suffering with harassment of any sort to seek help			1
' there are so many people who put up with this and feel helpless but they should n't			0
i stood up to my stalker and now i feel free			0
' ms @entity7 said she was supported by the @entity111 , which helped her through ' the most difficult times '			1
judge @entity113 told @entity98 that @entity15 was not a bad man , but a ' poorly ' one			2

' there has been a life - altering , intensely frightening , series of verbal attacks			2
