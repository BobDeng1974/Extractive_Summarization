it 's well known that exercise can make your muscles bigger			1
now , a study has found it may make your brain larger , too			1
physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain , increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination , according to @entity15 news			1
the changes in the brain may have health implications in the long - term , such as reducing the risk of falling , said the study 's author , dr @entity21 , of the @entity23			1
dr @entity21 said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits , such as lower levels of body fat , reduced heart disease risk factors , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes			1
but he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain			1
they recruited 10 pairs of identical twins , who were all men aged 32 to 36 years			0
focusing on twins , who have the same dna , would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies			0
in each pair of twins , one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other , though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives			0
dr @entity21 said : ' on average , the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins			0
' the twins had mri scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains , and specific regions			0
exercise did n't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole , dr @entity21 said			2
but there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement , he added			2
previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes the twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar , which reduces the risk of diabetes , a finding which is already well - known			1
the study was published in the journal @entity101 in @entity102			0
it comes after @entity105 researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter			0
university of @entity110 experts found regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria - structures in the cells that produce the body 's energy - in the brain			2
this energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently , effectively keeping it younger , researchers said			0
in the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions			2
and building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a ' buffer ' against age - related brain diseases such as @entity130 's .			1

study : exercising increases the amount of grey matter in the brain
it makes areas of the brain that control balance and *co-ordination* bigger
in the long term this could reduce the risk of falling or becoming immobile
previous studies show exercise can stave off @entity130 's and diabetes
