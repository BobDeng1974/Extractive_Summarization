you only had to look at the difference in @entity3 ’s reaction at the end of this test and at the end of the @entity8 ’s game to realise how much winning @entity9 matches for @entity10 matters to him			1
this win , and the fact he got runs , will be a massive weight off @entity3 ’s shoulders			1
it is impossible to understand the pressure you are under as @entity10 captain unless you have been there			1
when things are not going well you feel as if everyone is against you and , while it might be possible to escape the limelight between matches , you still have to do the day - to - day things and you feel as if you ’re letting people down			0
@entity31 grin : @entity3 cut a far happier figure after @entity10 defeated @entity33 in the third test they think it 's all over ... @entity3 and @entity37 ( r ) celebrate after victory is confirmed you feel like people are looking at you and talking about your captaincy or how badly you ’re batting			1
not contributing to the team is the thing that hurts the most as captain			0
it was when i went through some of my darkest moments — walking down a hotel corridor in @entity49 , knocking on @entity51 ’s door and asking if i should stay on as captain			0
it ’s a horrible place to be			0
as captain it ’s very rare that you are scoring runs personally and the team is winning			1
that means there is almost always a downside after a match and that is why @entity3 should relish this moment , because he ’s had the double whammy of losing games and not getting runs			2
keep calm and carry on : when @entity3 is batting well the the rest will follow in a spin : @entity69 inspired @entity10 to victory by unexpectedly taking six wickets video my best day - @entity69 we are all human and want to be liked , so the reception he got when he was batting will have given @entity3 an enormous confidence boost			1
it is abundantly clear the @entity10 cricketing public want him to succeed			2
i am still of the view that the most important thing for @entity10 is @entity3 the batsman			1
a lot of things will fall into place , including maybe his captaincy , if @entity3 is getting runs			2
it was a brave decision for him to have a bat on a pitch with a little bit of grass on it here			0
but it was the right decision and he went in with a clear mind and deserved the luck he got at the start of his innings			0
patriot games : the victory at the @entity101 obviously meant a lot to @entity10 's captain when @entity3 is batting , everything is calm and comfortable			1
it is the most important thing for @entity10 and it transfers into his captaincy			2
i thought he had an excellent game as captain			0
virtually every move he made paid off and tactically he was very good			0
he learned from mistakes and set some very good fields			0
the way he used @entity69 showed he is building trust and that is paying off			0
the fundamental point , though , is that the @entity10 team will be better off when he is scoring runs consistently , not sporadically , and the management must decide if he can be that batsman while he is captain or whether at some point someone else has to do that .			1
