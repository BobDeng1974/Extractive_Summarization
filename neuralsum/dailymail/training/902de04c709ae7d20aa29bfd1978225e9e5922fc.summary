the @entity1 derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in world football			0
despite their struggles this season , @entity5 and @entity6 are among the biggest clubs in the country and there will be hundreds of millions of pounds worth of talent on show at the @entity14			1
he has transformed from the lightweight youngster who joined the club to a heavyweight of the side who is often relied upon to keep them in matches			0
@entity5 's @entity28 , in comparison , is too prone to mistakes and his position in the team is all - too often questioned			1
verdict : @entity44 9 @entity29 has enjoyed a fine start to the season in goal for @entity6 @entity28 just fails to keep out @entity49 's header in @entity5 's defeat by @entity51 right back : @entity52 vs @entity53 @entity52 is one of the best full backs in the world , tirelessly running up and down that flank all game			1
he is almost as important to @entity5 's attack as he is their defence			2
@entity53 , however , is is a liability at right back for @entity6			2
verdict : @entity52 8 @entity53 6 @entity52 ( left ) is one of the world 's best full backs whereas @entity53 is a liability centre back : @entity64 vs @entity65 neither defence has covered themselves in glory this season , with @entity5 conceding too many soft goals , but @entity6 's centre of defence has been terrible for much of the season			1
@entity64 is much better than @entity65 , that 's all there is to it			0
verdict : @entity64 9 @entity65 6 @entity64 is the leader of @entity5 's defence , even if he is not quite at his imperious best @entity65 wrestles @entity78 to the ground in @entity6 's draw against @entity81 centre back : @entity82 vs @entity83 @entity82 was a liability for part of last season but rallied and is now seen as a safe option at the heart of @entity5 's defence			1
@entity83 is a better full back than a centre half and seems to struggle with the physicality of the @entity33			0
verdict : @entity82 7 @entity83 6 @entity82 ( left ) has turned his @entity5 career around but compatriot @entity83 seems lightweight left back : @entity93 vs @entity94 @entity94 has had a troubled start to his career at @entity6 , struggling for fitness and with injury , but since he has got back into the side he is starting to find the form that made him the best young full back in the country			1
@entity5 's @entity93 has looked slow and off - the - pace recently , and lacks the ability of @entity94 even when fully fit			1
verdict : @entity93 7 @entity94 8 @entity93 is beaten in the air by @entity49 and has looked off the pace this season @entity94 ( right ) is finding his feet after a slow start to his @entity6 career midfielder : @entity109 vs @entity110 @entity110 , at @entity6 , can seemingly play anywhere but is making a strong case for being a regular holding midfielder			2
he can screen the back four as well as join the attack to do damage to opponents			0
@entity109 seems to have struggled a bit since his arrival at @entity5			2
verdict : @entity109 8 @entity109 seems to have struggled since arriving at @entity5 but @entity110 ( right ) is @entity6 's midfield screen midfielder : @entity121 vs @entity122 @entity121 has had a very good start to the season and has been rewarded with starts in the majority of @entity5 's matches			1
his energy is very useful to @entity129			0
this would be @entity122 's first match of the season but when he 's on form he makes @entity6 tick			2
verdict : @entity121 7 @entity122 7 the industrious @entity121 ( right ) challenges @entity135 in @entity5 's defeat by @entity137 @entity122 , at training on friday , is in line to start his first match of the season for @entity6 midfielder : @entity22 vs @entity142 the battle of the big men in midfield			1
even if he is well off his usual form this season , @entity22 is one of the league 's powerhouses and there is always the potential for a goal from nowhere			0
@entity142 seems to have turned a corner after his goal at @entity155 and lung - busting performance against @entity81			0
@entity22 is still his better , however			0
verdict : @entity157 @entity142 7 @entity22 has been below par this season but can still dominate the midfield @entity142 looked reinvigorated against @entity81 and here takes on @entity161 attacking midfielder : @entity163 vs @entity164 the @entity165 has been played on either flank for @entity6 and creates magic with that left foot			0
although what he produces is no illusion – he can pick out a man with a pass or score from virtually anywhere and his pace can take him away from opponents			0
@entity163 is more of a touch player and sometimes seems to go missing - but can also produce a goal or a pass from nothing			0
verdict : @entity182 9 @entity163 ( right ) is @entity5 's creative spark and will hope to unlock the @entity6 defence @entity164 can create chances from set - pieces and in open play and will be vital for @entity6 striker : @entity189 vs @entity190 both cost more than £ 25m but are their club 's secondary striker			1
neither centre forward has fired this season - @entity189 has scored just twice in the @entity33 ( although one was a beauty at @entity197 ) and @entity198 has looked off - colour since the @entity199 , although @entity6 will hope the last - gasp equaliser against @entity81 will galvanise the @entity201			2
verdict : @entity189 7 @entity198 8 @entity189 has failed to fire this season for @entity5 and was in the side that lost against @entity137 @entity190 ( right ) slams in the equaliser against @entity81 and @entity6 hope there will be many more striker : @entity208 vs @entity209 now on to the talismanic centre forwards			1
@entity208 's record this season speaks for itself : 11 goals in 13 games in all competitions , eight goals in his last seven , joint - top scorer in the @entity33 with nine			0
although less prolific this season , @entity209 will be champing at the bit after his three - match suspension and will lead @entity6 's attack verdict : @entity208 9 @entity209 8 @entity209 ( left ) and @entity208 will be the main men in attack on sunday analysts @entity225 predict that a @entity5 win is the most likely outcome against @entity6 @entity229 players match up with @entity5 - @entity230 @entity231 : @entity232 82			1
