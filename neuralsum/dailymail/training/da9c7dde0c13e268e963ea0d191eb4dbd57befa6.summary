by @entity0 as the saying goes , ‘ nobody remembers who came second ’ , yet the past week of athletics at @entity5 has shown this is clearly nonsense			2
two 20 - year - old former world junior champions from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , brushed aside the might of the @entity13 to win silver in the sprints and immediately spoke of their first senior honours as ‘ stepping stones ’ to success			1
we will remember these names , all right			0
in the first five days of athletics at the @entity22 , @entity9 won 16 medals , including three golds			1
but best of all , 11 of those who stepped onto the podium at @entity5 are 23 or under			1
delight : @entity28 reckons the @entity30 success in @entity31 will get them going for gold in @entity34 many of these silver - and bronze - medal performances were significant breakthroughs for young athletes who seized their chances at a major competition			1
others , such as @entity30 200m champion @entity42 and @entity43 in the 100m — both 23 — reached high - calibre finals , gaining valuable experience against some of the fastest athletes in the world and performing well on the biggest stage of their careers			1
for long jump silver medallist @entity56 , 21 , @entity57 , 23 , in the triple jump and wheelchair racer @entity53 , 18 , @entity22 success has been an exciting surprise			1
yet they too are not content to dwell on their achievements but recognise they can be a springboard to more			0
@entity10 said : ‘ people have said that this @entity22 is a great place to establish yourself , get that great championships experience and learn how to win medals at championships			1
taking that forwards , i know we ’ve got the @entity72 in a couple of weeks ’ time , and then the @entity74 next year and eventually the @entity75 in 2016			0
‘ so it ’s been great to learn how to win a medal and how to deal with the stress and the pressures of it and go out and win a medal on the day			0
it ’s a great stepping stone			0
’ better luck next time : @entity10 picked up the silver and will hope for even better in @entity34 in two years fighting against the best : @entity10 came up against some of the best sprinters around at @entity5 @entity28 remembers sharing a room with @entity87 , already a 400m hurdles world and @entity91 champion , at the 1994 @entity22 in @entity92 , @entity93			1
@entity28 was 24 and still a ‘ soldier who ran a bit ’ and marvelled at @entity87 taking cold showers after her races to aid her recovery			2
yet @entity28 won 800m gold there and went on to complete a remarkable middle - distance double at the @entity91 in @entity102 10 years later			1
‘ without the @entity22 there ’s no chance i would have ever become a double @entity91 champion , ’ @entity28 told the @entity103			1
‘ the @entity107 have been an unbelievable springboard for me and many others			2
‘ it may still be two years to go until @entity34 but it ’s effectively just around the corner for all these athletes			0
new star names are emerging here in @entity31 who will go on to become household names			1
’ double trouble : @entity119 and @entity11 celebrate their bronze and silver medals in the 200m final @entity9 ’s young team at @entity5 could have been even stronger had it not been for injuries , the early selection deadline of june 1 or the clash with the @entity129			1
the fastest female in @entity30 this year , @entity130 , won world junior gold in @entity132 , while heptathlete @entity133 , 17 , achieved a heptathlon and high jump double after withdrawing from these games			2
@entity137 , who missed the @entity107 with a foot injury , is still only 21 but leads the @entity30 rankings for heptathlon , high jump and long jump			2
@entity143 , 19 , is the quickest over 400m			0
@entity144 , the only man to break the 10 - second barrier for 100m this season , has not been selected in the individual event at either the @entity107 or @entity72 championships			2
getting close : @entity42 came close against the @entity149 in the 200m final and is looking promising @entity150 , who won long jump silver in @entity152 aged 23 before going on to clinch the @entity91 and @entity22 titles , said : ‘ that ’s where i see the @entity22 being of major importance , for younger guys or guys who grab that opportunity to break through and give it a go			1
it would have been great to see @entity162 here and , looking at the field , i think he really would have stepped up and had a good time			0
he is a different level of athlete			0
‘ competing in front of a crowd like that really is something special and sadly it will be a little while before we get another @entity30 crowd at a major — the @entity74 in @entity176 , i guess — so hopefully he ’ll be there			0
it will be a handy relay team as well , actually			0
’ crucially , @entity30 athletes also now face significant competition from within			0
admin : @entity28 is now president of @entity9 and has been working in @entity31 our women won 4x100m bronze at the @entity74 last year , but the battle is now even more fierce for those four relay places , with the nation ’s young guns now believing they can take on the @entity188 and @entity149			1
@entity189 , 21 , who won @entity22 200m bronze and came sixth in the 100m final , agreed : ‘ definitely — there are loads of us coming up and we ’re all upping our game because we all know next year at the @entity74 we ’re all going to be on the podium			1
‘ we ’ll all be in the final chasing those @entity188 and @entity149 down			0
we know we can do it			0
’ @entity11 said those words just minutes after winning her first senior medal			0
the @entity22 are not over yet but we are already looking forward to the successes they could spark for this exciting , hungry young group of athletes			2
close but no cigar ... what about in @entity34 ? @entity43 is another showing potential - in the women 's 100m			0

@entity9 won 16 medals in first five days of @entity208 at the @entity107
11 of those on the podium were 23 or under and gained great experience
young *talents* like @entity10 are establishing themselves in @entity31
@entity28 won 800m gold in 1994 @entity107 before @entity91 crowns
she says there 's ' no chance ' she could have reached the same heights without valuable experience gained at the @entity22
@entity28 : ' new star names are emerging here in @entity31 who will go on to become household names ’
