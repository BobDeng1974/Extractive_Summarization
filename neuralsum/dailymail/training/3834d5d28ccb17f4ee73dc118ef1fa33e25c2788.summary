the family of a schizophrenic black man who was gunned down by a white police officer in a park six months ago are still fighting for the cop to be arrested			1
officer @entity5 , 38 , responded to a call for a welfare check for 31 - year - old @entity8 , who was sleeping on a bench in @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 on april 30			1
he gave him a patdown but @entity8 , who had a history of schizophrenia and paranoia , became combative and the pair exchanged punches before @entity8 hit @entity5 with his baton , and @entity5 responded with gunfire , killing the man			1
earlier this month , the police department fired @entity5 , concluding that while he had correctly identified @entity8 as emotionally disturbed , he ignored his training and treated him as a criminal			1
a scuffle ensued between the men and @entity5 shot him 14 times but the victim 's family wants more : criminal charges for the officer , and improvements in the way mentally ill people are treated by police and social service programs			1
@entity8 's family participated in a vigil days after his april 30 death but then said little publicly as they waited out an investigation into the shooting			1
they carried out small , orderly rallies as they waited for details about what happened and for the officer to be disciplined			2
they were frustrated months later , when protests erupted in @entity55 following the shooting of a black 18 - year - old , @entity58 , by a white officer			2
demanding answers : @entity61 holds posters used in rallies calling the release of information and policy changes after her son , @entity8 , was shot and killed by a police officer ' we tried to be accepting and respectful of the way the system works , ' @entity8 's brother @entity71 said			1
' until it got to the point where the @entity76 thing happened			0
now , you know who this police officer is , you 're seeing them get information , and in @entity12 , we 're not getting no information			2
' he added : ' they messed with the wrong family ... i 'm not going to back down			0
' the family joined a @entity12 demonstration organized to support those in @entity55 , and attention quickly focused on the similarities between the @entity58 and @entity8 cases			1
@entity96 acknowledged some missteps , such as when protesters blocked a freeway exit ramp or became disruptive at a @entity101 meeting			0
but overall , the protests have been peaceful , which @entity96 said is crucial to building support for the family 's goals			2
while the protests have highlighted that @entity5 is white and @entity8 was black , @entity8 's family is focusing on broader issues , including mental health			1
police chief @entity111 promised more training for officers dealing with people with mental illness and , on october 15 , fired @entity5 , who has appealed			1
calling for justice : relatives and friends rally for the district attorney to bring charges earlier this month in @entity11 in downtown @entity12 , where @entity8 was shot after an altercation with the officer tragic : paint left in @entity11 by @entity8 's family marks the area where he was shot dead @entity8 's family wants to see @entity5 charged			1
the district attorney 's office has delayed a decision until it gets a recommendation from a national use - of - force expert			2
the @entity131 have been studying the law and police policy to better advocate for changes			0
they 're also finding other ways to channel their grief			0
@entity8 's mother is organizing a support group for women whose sons died in police shootings or custody and hopes to address shortcomings in mental health and social service programs			1
@entity61 had struggled to get her son care after insurance problems caused him to miss his medication last winter			0
until then , he had been doing well , living in group housing and working			0
without the drugs , he became paranoid and began moving from place to place , eventually ending up in the park , where he was sleeping when @entity5 responded to a call from a nearby business about him			1
memorial : @entity159 , left , and his brother , @entity96 , sing a song they wrote about the death of their brother			0
proceeds from the song will benefit a foundation established in @entity8 's memory never forgotten : @entity96 wears a bracelet honoring his brother @entity8 as he plays the song ' had he had that medication , he might still be sitting here with us , ' @entity61 said			1
@entity96 and another brother , musician @entity159 , wrote a song expressing their grief , anger and frustration			0
the song describes their ' worst fear ' - a brother ' shot 14 times , did n't do no wrong			2
laying in the park , really i do n't see no harm			0
the investigation is still going on			0
' proceeds from the song sold on @entity190 will benefit a foundation established in @entity8 's memory			1
' we ca n't bring @entity8 back , ' @entity159 said , ' but what we can do is help somebody along the way			2
' @entity159 and @entity96 remain bothered by police descriptions of their brother as homeless and violent			0
they describe @entity8 as fearful , but not dangerous			2
he checked into a hotel two days before the shooting and had almost $ 150 in cash on him when he died			0
questions : the family said the high - profile rallies held in the aftermath of @entity58 's death at the hand of white cop @entity211 ( both pictured ) , has led to answers in that case that they have n't had in theirs ' he was n't dressed bummy , he was still dressed well , he had some @entity217 on his feet ... so we just felt like that was uncalled for , ' said @entity96 , who followed his brother into the roofing business before starting a remodeling company			1
@entity61 moved her sons from @entity224 , @entity225 , to @entity12 in 1995 to escape growing gang violence			0
she raised them to work hard , have faith and look out for one another			0
but @entity159 said the shooting showed them that they had to be leaders			0
' it 's taught us , ' he said , ' to use our minds on a broader scale			0
