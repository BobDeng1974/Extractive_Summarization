the massive estate in @entity44 includes 36 horse stalls , a riding arena and a man - made pond			2
when completed , the stables will include an indoor arena , paddocks and barns			2
the day - long boat trip comes amid bad ratings for the once - beloved morning show anchor , who has come under fire since his co-host @entity57 was ousted from her spot last year			1
taking a break : @entity2 stands by his yacht in @entity61 , which is near his $ 15 million home appropriate : the vessel is named ' resilient ' , which is apt considering his low ratings on the morning show he was blamed for her swift departure , even though @entity69 bosses denied he had a part in it			1

' these days , i only get asked to host dinners if polio is busy			1
i have a lower q rating than polio right now			0

' @entity2 could have been referring to any of a myriad of critical articles in the @entity112 that have been written about him recently			0

under fire : @entity2 has been blamed for the swift departure of co-host @entity57 ( second left ) last summer			0
they are pictured with fellow hosts @entity124 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 ' it is clear that the once - popular host ’s relationship with his audience is in peril , ' @entity116 wrote			1
' mr. @entity2 ’s year is a lesson in how a combination of missteps - @entity69 ’s and his own - can precipitate a star ’s fall			0
' angry viewers have been calling on @entity69 to fire @entity2 , who was blamed for playing a part in co-host @entity57 's ignominious demotion last year , and today is still lagging behind its arch - rival on @entity69 .			2
