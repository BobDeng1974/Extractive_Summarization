commander @entity9 ( pictured on duty before the allegations surfaced ) could be facing the sack over claims she had an affair with a male subordinate admiral @entity34 , who is not related to the captain , told @entity36 : ‘ the rules are very clear and if she has had a relationship with someone under her command then she ’s rather let down other women in the @entity4 , because there are people who will jump on this and say this is why women should n’t be on ship – which is total nonsense			1
’ @entity48 , who is divorced from a @entity4 helicopter pilot , is the first woman to command a frontline warship in the @entity4 ’s 500 - year history			1
her 5,000 - ton type 23 frigate was conducting anti-narcotics patrols in the @entity55 when the claims of misconduct emerged , and she was flown back to @entity10			1

last night lord @entity48 added : ‘ this incident is very sad			2
if the allegations are true i doubt commander @entity48 will continue in her post or be given another ship to command			1
there are so many excellent officers coming through that she wo n’t get the chance			0
‘ without any doubt , women must continue to lead in the @entity4 as they have proved themselves in an array of demanding jobs			2
the truth is we would n’t have enough sailors in the @entity4 if you removed the women			2
they are a key part of what we do			0
admiral @entity34 , who is not related to the captain , said that if the claims were true , the trailblazing commander would have let down all female officers - and provided fuel for those who argue against women being on active service ‘ there were not any women aboard when i was commanding ships but i was aware of men having sex with each other and they were disciplined			1
indeed , early in my career it was illegal			0
