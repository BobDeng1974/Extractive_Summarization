runaway brides : @entity3 police are seeking more than 100 @entity1 mail - order brides who vanished after marrying bachelors from a poor rural area			1
it is thought a people smuggling ring may be involved after decades of family planning policies and a traditional preference for boys , the male population now far outnumbers women in @entity3 , making it difficult to find a wife			1
the area 's bachelors were introduced to the women by @entity37 , a @entity1 bride who had lived in the area for 20 years , @entity33 reported			1
she received payments of more than 100,000 yuan ( $ 16,000 , Â£ 10,300 ) if the introductions were successful			2
she also disappeared with the women , it added			1
the state - run newspaper cited an unnamed local official saying an organised ring may have been involved in the mass disappearance			0
' with the advanced communication techniques of today , it 's easy for all the brides to leave at the same time , ' he told the newspaper			2
the @entity53 , citing local media , reports that ms @entity37 had earlier this year travelled around rural parts of @entity10 drumming up customers for @entity1 mail - order brides			2
then on november 20 , after she 'd made more than 100 matches , the wives are said to have told their new husbands they were having a meal with other @entity1 brides			1
at least one bride has since returned , according to the @entity53 report citing @entity64			0
she said she had ' lost consciousness ' after eating and woke up in a small house far from @entity7			2
someone in the house was said to have told her she would be going somewhere else to ' find another husband '			1
instead she left and returned to @entity7 where she filed a police report			0
buying wives from abroad has become increasingly common in some of @entity3 's poor rural areas , where a gender imbalance has developed due to a traditional preference for sons and the country 's family planning policies			0
across @entity3 , 118 males are born for every 100 females , according to government statistics			0
in some rural areas men can be expected to own a house , car and have considerable wealth before they can attract a @entity3 bride , a cost the @entity33 said could reach 400,000 yuan			0
but with many unable to do so the trade in overseas brides , which is often linked to human trafficking , has grown in @entity3 .			0
