they have already splashed on teenage sensation @entity6 and midfielder @entity7 , with more deals in the pipeline as @entity10 looks to haul his new side from the wreckage of last season			1
@entity14 could have a @entity15 feel next year with midfielder @entity16 and @entity18 's wing star @entity17 both on @entity10 's wanted list			1
right - back @entity43 and powerful centre - half @entity45 could both be picked up , with both playing in @entity10 's @entity48 side - as does undisputed no 9 @entity30			2
other @entity50 stars to be linked with @entity14 moves include @entity52 and former @entity53 forward @entity54			1
it means there 's no room for current @entity14 charges @entity58 or @entity59 , while the midfield revamp sees @entity39 and @entity61 ousted			1
here , @entity62 looks at a potential starting xi for next season , and some other targets @entity10 will have in mind			0
theatre of dreams : could this be @entity0 's new line - up for next season ? @entity0 's possible xi for next season ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity71 ; @entity43 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity6 ; @entity16 , @entity7 , @entity74 ; @entity17 , @entity75 , @entity76 and here 's @entity10 's shopping list , including some alternative names that could be lining up at @entity14 next season			1
@entity16 @entity80 @entity82 midfielder rated one of the best in the world was wanted by @entity86 but @entity80 would not sell			0
@entity87 have discussed £ 32m offer but it wo n't be enough			0
in action : @entity16 , battling @entity92 's @entity91 , is one of the most sought - after midfielders in the world @entity96 @entity95 @entity97 has been short on form and confidence but @entity0 hope a change of scenery can rediscover the defender of old			2
@entity95 not keen to sell to @entity0 for less than £ 12million			0
aerial threat : @entity96 ( right ) , battling @entity105 's @entity104 , is wanted by @entity0 @entity43 @entity106 exciting right - back			2
the 24 - year - old has been watched by @entity95 closely and was the subject of interest from @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 but @entity5 is a fan			2
home comforts : @entity10 make look to his @entity50 side for right - back @entity43 @entity21 @entity117 @entity6 and @entity118 may be at left - back but @entity21 is a decent defensive midfielder too			1
his displays in @entity92 will hike up his £ 12m price but would be an astute addition			0
see you next year ? @entity21 ( left ) , tackling @entity17 , could be a utility man for @entity0 @entity45 and @entity124 @entity106 @entity45 and @entity125 are both ready to leave and 22 - year - old @entity125 has been poised to join @entity126			1
left - side @entity73 may offer better balance for @entity0 's defence			0
powerful : @entity45 ( right ) , iun action against @entity130 , may be the answer for @entity0 at the back @entity17 @entity18 @entity133 - footed forward can play comfortably in a 4 - 3 - 3 , was a @entity0 fan as a boy is also wanted by @entity80 and @entity53 among others			1
@entity18 want around £ 30million			0
world star : @entity18 and @entity82 's @entity17 , holding off @entity138 , would be key to a new @entity0 attack @entity141 @entity140 firm favourite of @entity10			2
lacks pace but dictates game with strong left foot			0
his cruciate injury may prompt @entity0 to revive interest in @entity87 's @entity148 though			0
@entity150 maestro : @entity141 ( left ) , in action against @entity152 , is a long - term @entity0 target			0

@entity0 have already *bought* @entity7 and @entity6
@entity5 looking to revamp @entity14 squad
@entity50 stars like @entity45 and @entity43 could arrive
