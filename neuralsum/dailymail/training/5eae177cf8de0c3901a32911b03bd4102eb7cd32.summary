@entity1 blocked police investigations into sexual abuse at a children ’s home to protect their intelligence gathering operation , campaigners will tell the @entity7 today			1
victims of abuse at the @entity12 children ’s home in @entity13 have accused senior members of the security services of colluding in protecting abusers from being investigated or prosecuted			1
campaigners are taking legal action at the @entity7 in @entity20 to force a full independent inquiry with the power to force @entity1 witnesses to testify and release documents			1
victims of abuse at the @entity26 children 's home in @entity13 , pictured , have accused senior members of the security services of blocking police investigations the case is the first to examine allegations of a @entity32 state cover - up of abuse at the @entity20 home in the 1970s			1
claims that children were molested for years because police and the @entity32 security services were using the home , run by a member of a @entity41 paramilitary organisation , to gather intelligence are already subject to a separate inquiry in @entity13 , the @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) inquiry , led by sir @entity48			1
but critics of the @entity46 claim it lacks sufficient powers to get to the heart of the scandal as it may not be able to compel either evidence or witnesses from @entity1			2
victims are applying for a judicial review to establish a similar full inquiry in @entity13 to the @entity60 - based child abuse inquiry , now chaired by justice @entity61 from @entity62			2
lawyers for the victims have lodged papers in @entity65 arguing : ‘ there is credible evidence ( and it is therefore arguable ) that the security forces and security services were aware of the abuse , permitted it to continue and colluded in protecting the individuals involved from investigation or prosecution			1
’ senior members of the @entity77 , the @entity74 and the @entity75 have also been accused of collusion , blackmail and cover - up			1
claims that children were molested for years because police and the @entity32 security services were using the home to gather intelligence is already subject to a separate inquiry led by sir @entity48 , pictured one alleged victim of the abuse at @entity12 , @entity89 , was placed there with his younger brother in the 1970s			1
he said in a sworn affidavit : ‘ if we had had a proper inquiry in the 1980s then i would n’t have to relive this again today			0
@entity1 and @entity96 can not be allowed to hide things , and i believe everything needs to be brought out into the open			2
‘ i find it heart - wrenching that there were security men could have been behind the abuse or involved in it … because they were in positions of authority or supposed to be protecting the state they get away with it			1
’ solicitor @entity107 who is representing mr @entity89 and other survivors said : ‘ the allegations of our clients and others have been in the public domain for years ; the role of state has been alleged for a long time			2
there is now an opportunity for the truth to be uncovered for our clients to be able to move on with their fractured lives			0
‘ this opportunity is possibly being lost because of the @entity32 government ’s fear of being exposed to impunity and straightforward corruption and criminality against innocents used as pawns in a cynical political exercise			2
’ he added : ‘ this is about state agents in a very dark episode of the conflict in the @entity13			0
’ a former @entity32 military official has also backed a full inquiry			0
@entity135 , a former army information officer in @entity13 , said : ‘ there is now irrefutable evidence that previous inquiries were deliberately engineered or manipulated to mislead parliament by concealing the role of government agencies in covering up the abuses			0
’ in 1981 , three men were imprisoned for between four and six years for a number of offences relating to systematic sexual abuse of children over a period of years			0
but the allegations of @entity1 involvement have never been fully examined			2

@entity152 was jailed for sexual offences in 1981 and is now dead			0
an @entity160 spokesman said : ‘ there are longstanding claims that @entity1 blocked one or more police investigations into @entity12 in the 1970s in order to protect its own intelligence - gathering operation , a terrible indictment which raises the spectre of countless vulnerable boys having faced further years of brutal abuse			1
‘ it ’s only @entity172 ’s inquiry that will be able to ensure that evidence does n’t remain hidden in @entity175 filing cabinets and that even senior politicians will have to attend the inquiry			0
’ a @entity179 spokesperson said : ‘ the government is cooperating fully with all investigations into allegations relating to the @entity12 boys ’ home			0
it is not appropriate to comment further while these investigations are under way			0
