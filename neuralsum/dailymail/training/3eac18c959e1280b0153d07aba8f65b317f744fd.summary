an experimental drug could help millions of women across the world combat cellulite an experimental drug could help combat the dreaded cellulite that plagues millions of women across the world , new research has revealed			1
a trial carried out in the @entity9 by @entity10 has shown a ' significant improvement ' in the appearance of ' orange peel ' skin on the thighs and buttocks of the women taking part			1
cellulite is a term to describe lumpy , dimpled flesh on the thighs , buttocks and abdomen , and is most common in adolescent and adult women			1
the new study could provide a ray of hope for those women left feeling self - conscious by the condition , which is not serious but can be unsightly			0
there are currently no treatments for cellulite in the @entity9 that are approved by the @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
the study involved 150 women between the ages of 18 and 45			1
each participant received up to three treatment sessions of the drug @entity39 ( @entity40 ) or a placebo			1
the treatment sessions were around 21 days apart and up to 12 injections were administered into the dimpled skin on the buttock or thigh			2
the findings revealed 68 per cent of those women receiving the high to mid dosage of the drug reported being ' satisfied ' or ' very satisfied ' with their cellulite treatment			1
that compared to just 34 per cent of the patients given the placebo			0
cellulite is a localised metabolic disorder of tissue under the skin			0
it affects between 85 to 98 per cent women , of all ethnicities			2
the condition can involve the loss of elasticity or shrinking of collagen cords , called ' septae ' , that attach the skin to the muscle layers below			0
when fat in cellulite prone areas swells and expands , the septae tether the skin , which causes surface dimpling characteristic of cellulite			0
@entity39 works by targeting and breaking those collagen tethers with the goal of reducing the skin dimpling and potentially resulting in the smoothing of the skin			2
@entity80 , chief executive and president of @entity10 , said : ' we continue to be encouraged by the promising and positive results of our program			2
' we believe these data establish proof of concerpt for @entity40 as a potential treatment for cellulite and enable @entity10 to pursue our development and regulatory strategy to most efficiently and effectively advance this exciting program			1
' we look forward to initiating a planned phase 2b clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015			0
' a trial carried out by @entity10 in the @entity9 tested the drug @entity39 on a study - group of 150 women aged 18 to 45			1
of those receiving high to mid doses , 68 per cent reported being ' satisfied ' or ' very satisfied ' with their treatment			1
pictured is a diagram showing the difference between normal skin and cellulite @entity109 , chief medical officer of the company , added : ' these data have exceeded our expectations , demonstrating statistically significant improvements in cellulite as measured by both physicians and patients			0
' these are challenging endpoints and ones that we believe are critical in the context of regulatory consideration			0
' we are continuing to analyse these exciting data and will be gathering key opinion leader and regulatory input and look forward to publishing and presenting our findings in peer - reviewed venues in the future			0
' despite multiple therapeutic approaches for the attempted treatment of cellulite , there are no @entity33 - approved treatments and little scientific evidence that any current treatments are beneficial			0
@entity39 is a medicine manufactured from biological sources , that already has @entity33 approval , as well as approval in @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 for the treatment of @entity144 's contracture - a progressive hand disease that prevents the patient from straightening and properly using their fingers			2
it is also @entity33 approved to treat men with curvature of the penis , a condition known as @entity155 's disease .			0
