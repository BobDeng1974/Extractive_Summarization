an ancient @entity1 drinking game enjoyed more than 2,000 years ago at social drinking parties has been replicated by researchers			1
the game , known as kottabos , involved men gathered in a circle flinging dregs of wine at a target in the centre of the room from a special cup known as a kylix			1
and now the game has been recreated using a 3d - printer to try and work out the best way to play it - with results suggesting throwing the wine like a baseball rather than a @entity21 is more successful			2
the game involved men setting on couches around a room			1
they would drink wine from a shallow cup known as a kylix ( shown )			1
when they reached the dregs they flung the wine to the centre of the room dr @entity23 , an assistant professor of art history at @entity24 , carried out the study into the game			1
it is thought to have been played in ancient @entity1 parties when men would relax on couches in the andron , a male - only room for social events with food and wine			1
there are two variations , both of which involve throwing wine from their shallow cup , known as a kylix , into the centre of the room			1
people gather on couches around the edge of a room while drinking while from a dish - like cup called a kylix			2
in the centre of the room is either a disc on a metal pole , or a bowl of water containing floating dishes			1
when party - goers get down to the dregs of their kylix , they should fling the liquid ( not the cup ) towards the centre of the room			2
the goal is to either knock the disc down or fill the floating dishes with wine so they sink , depending on the variation played			1
in the first variation , drinkers threw dregs of wine to try and knock down a disc balanced on a tall metal stand in the middle of the room			2
the other variation instead uses dishes floating in a larger bowl of water in the centre of the room			2
people had to throw their wine and attempt to get the dishes to sink			0
the game was understandably very messy , and with slaves thought to be required to clean up the resulting spilled wine			0
the game of skill is thought to have been especially popular at @entity1 and @entity100 symposia ( drinking parties ) in the 5th and 4th centuries @entity102 a kylix , seen here , has looped handles on either side , making it ideal for the throwing technique required for the ancient @entity1 drinking game of kottabos apparently , when flinging wine , the player would also be required to say the name of the object or person he desired			1
the game is likely of @entity117 origin but it spread throughout @entity118			0
despite the apparent element of luck in the game , it did also require a surprising amount of skill			0
players who were especially good at kottabos were often said to be favoured in other regards too , such as love , and large wagers were often also placed on a game			0
in her research , dr @entity131 created a 3d - printed kylix to replicate the conditions of the game			2
she found that throwing the liquid out of the cup overhead , like a baseball , was easier than trying to flick it with the wrist like a frisbee			0
but she said it likely descended into quite a messy affair , no matter how skilled the players were			0
pictured is a statute of @entity149 , known as @entity149 by the @entity150 , the god of the grape harvest , winemaking and wine			0
@entity149 was important in @entity1 culture as alcohol , particularly wine , played an important role in many activities and social events ‘ in a typical symposium setting , in an andron , you would have had couches arranged on almost all four sides of the room , and if you missed the target , you were likely to splatter your fellow symposiast across the way , ’ dr @entity131 told @entity161			1
‘ you 'd imagine that , by the end of the symposium , you 'd be drenched in wine , and your fellow symposiasts would be drenched in wine , too			0
’ however , she noted that she only used diluted grape juice in her version of the game , as it was a university attempt			0
for the full experiment , she said it would probably be best to have one or two kylixes of wine			0
@entity184 is thought to have been played in ancient @entity1 parties when men would relax on couches in the andron , a male - only room for social events with food and wine			1

dr @entity23 from @entity24 examined the ancient @entity1 drinking game of kottabos
the game involved men setting on couches around a room
they would drink wine from a shallow cup known as a kylix
when they reached the dregs they flung the wine to the centre of the room and attempted to knock down a disc or make floating dishes sink
dr @entity131 said the best method was to throw like a baseball , not a @entity21
