the sight of @entity1 on media duty with her wrist in a cast was a reminder of how tricky such injuries can be as @entity7 pulled out of his favourite @entity10 warm - up citing problems in the same area			1
the exact extent of the world no 1 ’s discomfort remains unclear , but he withdrew from the @entity18 tournament at @entity19 as ‘ a precaution ’			1
with @entity10 starting on monday , it means last year ’s beaten finalist will open his campaign having not had any kind of preparatory match on grass after making the final of the @entity28			2
@entity29 pulls out of @entity30 worry : world number two @entity7 was forced to withdraw in @entity19 with a wrist injury fully fit : @entity33 meanwhile beat @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36 the crowd at the @entity18 event were told @entity7 had pulled out as ‘ a precautionary measure ahead of @entity10 next week ’			1
@entity7 ( below ) withdrew from the @entity40 in early may due to soreness in his wrist and had a heavy schedule in playing three of the four weeks on clay after that			1
while there is no suggestion he will have the same issues as @entity51 , the @entity19 event has become an established part of his @entity10 routine , so the decision to skip it is unlikely to have been haphazard			1
@entity33 will be pleased to have no such concerns and after last week ’s third - round exit at @entity57 , he yesterday got in a useful exhibition match at the @entity59 at the @entity60 in @entity36			1
the @entity10 champion , with @entity62 watching , defeated @entity63 ’s @entity34 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 and looked sharp overall , although he had to save five second - set points			1
‘ i feel good , my body feels better this year			0
it ’s great to get a match and the court was very good , ’ he said			2
‘ there was some high quality tennis			0
@entity72 is a great guy to play because he has great intensity			0
’ precaution : @entity7 's wrist injury is not believed to be serious but it has dented his @entity10 preparation champion : @entity33 looked in top condition to defend his @entity10 title with a 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 win @entity33 will learn of his prospective path back to what would be a third straight final when the draw is made this morning , although the one thing he knows is that he will open proceedings on @entity87 at 1pm on monday			1
‘ a lot of players have spoken about it and how much of a privilege it is , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m sure there will be nerves and pressure but i am going to try to enjoy it			0
’ @entity51 was an interested onlooker , knowing that her only contribution at @entity10 will be working on the @entity99 coverage			0
having undergone an operation on her left wrist in april she has ruled out playing until october and has her eye on a lower tier circuit event in @entity105 for a possible return			2
to try and speed recovery she has turned vegan and said that seeing some of her peers make major strides in her absence , such as @entity112 and @entity113 , will spur her on			0
‘ it is a bit depressing because everybody is out there enjoying themselves , hitting the ball hard and competing , ’ she said			0
watching on : @entity33 's new coach @entity62 attended as he beat @entity34 in straight sets ‘ but in a way it motivates you			1
i have something to look forward to and can work hard because i know what i want to be doing at the end of it			0
’ @entity51 conceded she had tried to come back too quickly , hindered by getting so many different diagnoses			2
‘ it seems amazing that you can see seven surgeons who all say different things , ’ she said			0
it resulted in feeling helpless at times : ‘ i think a low moment for anybody coming out of surgery is when the nurse has to put your clothes on for you , or being unable to cut a piece of meat , although now i ’m vegan that does n’t matter			0
’ when she does come back it could almost seem like an entirely new career : ‘ i ’ve got four to five years of experience behind me , so that is going to help , but i ’m going to have virtually no ranking			2
’ @entity150 : @entity1 believes she came back too soon from her wrist injury but has learned from her mistake			1

@entity33 played an exhibition match at @entity59 in @entity36
