president @entity1 's new plan to spare 4.7 million illegal immigrants from the threat of deportation violates the @entity5 , a federal judge declared on tuesday , handing down the first legal ruling against the plan			1
judge @entity10 's ruling has no immediate impact , since the @entity1 administration says there was no reason for his @entity16 court to address the issue in the case , which concerns the legal status of 42 - year - old @entity21 immigrant @entity20			1
@entity22 is the first judge to rule on the legality of the plan @entity1 announced on nov. 20			2
the executive action by the @entity28 president is opposed by @entity29 and has already been legally challenged by two dozen @entity31 states			2
' president @entity1 's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the @entity5 as well as the @entity37 , and therefore is unconstitutional , ' judge @entity10 wrote			1
@entity38 : judge @entity10 ( left ) ruled tuesday that president @entity1 's plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants is beyond his authority under the @entity5 anti-immigration - amnesty protesters have turned up outside @entity1 events in the weeks since his announcement , including these people on dec. 9 in @entity47 , @entity48 the ' @entity49 ' of the @entity5 requires the president to faithfully execute laws passed by @entity52			1
@entity10 also ruled that the policy gives illegal immigrants a path ' to obtain substantive rights ' that belong only to citizens and legal @entity31 residents			2
@entity31 senators from both sides of the aisle weighed in on tuesday outside the @entity62 chamber			0
' i obviously agree with the idea that the action he took was an unlawful and unconstitutional action , ' @entity64 @entity63 sen. @entity63 told @entity68 , noting that he had not yet read the ruling			0
' i wish the president was a little bit more – i wish he had accepted the results of the election and decided that it was time , maybe , to go in a different direction , ' @entity63 said			0
' i do n't know that he got the message			0
' ' coming out right away with the immigration decision ' after the @entity28 ' disastrous midterm shellacking ' was n't helpful , ' he said			0
@entity28 senate majority whip @entity79 of @entity80 shot back : ' i think he 's wrong ' – referring to judge @entity10 , not sen. @entity63 – before slipping onto the @entity62 floor and out of reach of reporters			1
@entity87 sen. @entity86 , a @entity88 told @entity68 that @entity22 made ' an incorrect ruling , ' and then abruptly ended his press availability			1
the administration has defended its policy by classifying it as an example of prosecutorial discretion , - a special case of a mundane and widely accepted authority granted to court officials who often must choose which cases to bring to trial and which to dismiss			0
but @entity22 ruled that the president ’s policy goes ' beyond ' that , setting up a hard - and - fast framework for evaluating applications from millions of people – the opposite of a case - by - case determination			0
@entity1 's executive action ' goes beyond prosecutorial discretion , ' he wrote			1
' trouble : homeland security secretary @entity113 toured a new family immigration detention center in @entity115 , @entity116 , on monday – a massive facility with a capacity of 2,400 people , opening after a summer surge of children crossed the @entity31 - @entity124 border illegally @entity10 says he ruled on the executive action issue because he concluded that @entity20 could be eligible for relief under the executive action , a situation that required him to dive into the minutiae of what @entity1 's plan does and does n't do			1
government lawyers told @entity22 that @entity20 , who has pleaded guilty to re-entering the country , was not eligible because @entity1 's order does not affect criminal proceedings			2
@entity10 was named to the federal bench in 2002 by president @entity138 , a @entity29			2
his other most noteworthy ruling came a year later , when he presided over a case involving ' @entity142 ' actor @entity141 for conspiracy to distribute marijuana bongs			0
@entity10 sentenced @entity141 to nine months in federal prison			0

@entity138 - appointed jurist rules the @entity150 ' amnesty ' plan is an example of legislation – something only @entity52 can do
@entity28 @entity62 @entity79 and @entity86 sniped to @entity68 that @entity22 is ' wrong ' and made ' an incorrect decision '
judge dismissed administration 's claim that it is using ' prosecutorial discretion ' to decide which illegal immigrants it will stop deporting
' president @entity1 's unilateral legislative action violates the separation of powers provided for in the @entity5 , ' judge @entity10 ruled
@entity29 senator @entity63 said @entity1 had n't yet ' got the message ' about his party 's *stinging* *november* election defeat
