by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 26 march 2013 number one : mathematician @entity3 's theory for a ' universal machine ' , which forms the basis for all modern computing , has been voted the greatest @entity8 innovation of the @entity9 mathematician @entity3 's theoretical basis for all modern computers known as the ' universal machine ' has been voted the greatest @entity8 innovation of the past century in a new poll			1
the famous computer scientist came up with the theory , on which all modern computing is based , in a paper ' on computable numbers ' in 1936			1
he described a device that would read symbols on a tape and proposed that the tape could be used to program the machine			2
however it was not until later that @entity3 ’s ideas were realised as practical machines			2
the ' universal machine ' came top of a poll to find the greatest @entity8 innovation of the past 100 years			1
more than 50,000 votes were entered with @entity3 's theory securing 18 per cent - just one per cent ahead of the @entity34			1
' we owe him a huge debt , ' said @entity38 , who has championed @entity3 ’s innovation throughout the vote			2
' his @entity42 idea laid the logical and mathematical foundations of the technology you 're using to read this			0
' @entity3 studied mathematics at @entity48 , @entity49			0
with the outbreak of the @entity51 , he became head of a code - breaking unit at @entity54 , home to the @entity56			1
he used his profound mathematical skill to design , with colleague @entity58 , a series of huge electromechanical code - breaking machines known as ‘ bombes ’			0
changing the course of history : after the war , @entity3 created the first practical designs for a stored - program computer called the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) , pictured the ' universal machine ' theory laid the foundations for the first ever practical design for a stored - program computer which is still used today following the war , @entity3 moved to the @entity74 in @entity75			1
there he revisited the ideas proposed in 1936 and devised one of the first practical designs for a stored - program computer , called the @entity67 or @entity67			1
groundbreaking : @entity3 also invented the code breaking naval enigma machine , pictured , which cracked the @entity83 ' coding machine and stripped u-boats blockading @entity8 of their cover @entity3 's invention was one of 100 to be shortlisted for the national vote			1
x-ray crystallography – which revealed the hidden atomic structure of compounds and celebrates its centenary this year – took third place			0
leading figures , including prime minister @entity95 , professor @entity96 and presenter @entity97 , championed their favourite innovations and sparked heated debate across @entity100			0
' the vote has been an exciting battle between the tangible products of @entity8 ingenuity , such as @entity105 and the @entity34 , and innovative ideas , such as @entity3 ’s @entity42 , ' said @entity107 , director of external affairs at the @entity108			0
' we ’ve started an interesting public debate about innovation , particularly how creativity and technology feed into scientific discoveries			0
' ionic liquid chemistry was voted as the innovation most likely to shape the 21st century			0
' we are delighted to win , as this will shine a very public spotlight on how a team of chemists can dramatically improve the quality of the environment for everyone , ' said professor @entity125 , director of @entity126			0
heritage : a sculpture of mathematician @entity3 at the @entity54 museum where he had been head of a code - breaking unit			2

the ' universal machine ' is the theoretical basis for all modern computers
@entity3 created the theory in a paper ' on computable numbers ' in 1936
after @entity51 , @entity3 made the first designs for a stored - program computer
