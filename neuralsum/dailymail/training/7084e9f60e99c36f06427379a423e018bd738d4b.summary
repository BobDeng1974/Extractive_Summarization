@entity0 has backed the possibility of a new grammar school in her constituency , despite laws which ban the creation of selective schools			1
in a move which could herald a change in the @entity11 's education policy , the home secretary indicated she would support a study which will look into opening a ' satellite ' grammar school in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the new state - funded selective school - which would be the first for a generation - would be a second ' satellite ' campus joined to an existing grammar school in a nearby borough			1
@entity0 ( left ) has signalled her support for a new grammar school to open in her constituency , despite a similar move being ruled out last year by former education secretary @entity28 ( right ) because of that , it would avoid breaching laws which stop new selective schools being created			1
it comes after @entity28 , the former education secretary , ruled out a similar proposal in @entity35 , @entity36 , which would have taken up to 1,300 pupils			0
mr @entity28 - who was keen to revamp comprehensive schools - allowed a new free school to open on the site , instead			2
ms may 's willingness to consider the move sends a strong message about her stance on academic selection - a topic which is still hotly - debated among the @entity11 party			1
a statement on her website says the home secretary ' welcomed proposals to consider establishing a " satellite " grammar school site in @entity15 ' , in response to parental demand			1
testing : some grammar schools admit successful students by their grades in the 11 - plus , while in other areas , pupils who pass the test are also ranked by admission criteria , such as the distance they live from the school she said : ' grammar schools attract considerable support from @entity15 families			1
if a good school wishes to expand in line with existing legislation then this must be seriously considered			0
' one of @entity76 's policies is to allow existing schools to apply to become grammar schools			2
the proposal for the satellite campus has come from @entity82 and @entity15 council , which is looking to create more secondary school places in the area			2
there are currently no grammar schools in the borough , although there are several in neighbouring @entity89			0
the @entity11 - run council says there will be a shortfall of 100 secondary school places in @entity15 - which currently has a comprehensive education system - by 2020			2
there are currently 164 grammar schools in @entity97 after many of them closed in the 1960s and 70s when there was a shift towards comprehensives			0
the establishment of any new wholly or partially selective state - funded schools is banned under the the former @entity108 government 's @entity106			1
however , existing schools are allowed to expand			0
at present , some grammar schools admit successful students by ranked order - all candidates are ranked by their 11 - plus score			0
in other areas , pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria , which can include the distance they live from the school			0
those opposed to grammar schools argue that by dividing children at the age of 11 through taking an exam is socially divisive , and other schools in the surrounding area suffer , and richer children are more likely to succeed because their parents can afford extra tuition to get them through the test			0
however , supporters say that academically bright children do better if they taught together .			0
