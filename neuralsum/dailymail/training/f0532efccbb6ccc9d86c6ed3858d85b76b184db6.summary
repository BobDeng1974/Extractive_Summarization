@entity162 , professor at the @entity163 , who has studied the issues surrounding sex change operations , told @entity167 : ‘ research we conducted a decade ago found there is huge uncertainty over whether changing someone 's sex is a good or a bad thing			2
‘ while no doubt great care is taken to ensure that appropriate patients undergo gender reassignment , there 's still a large number of people who have the surgery but remain traumatised - often to the point of committing suicide			2
‘ while we have n’t looked at the situation since then , given the difficulties in researching this area , it is likely that the same issues remain today			0
’ their brother , @entity189 , said at the time that they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution			0
professor @entity134 agreed to end their lives - again on grounds of ' unbearable psychological suffering ' - after their local hospital had denied their request for euthanasia			2
dr @entity134 told the @entity202 : ' the choice of @entity7 has nothing to do with fatigue of life			1
' there are other factors that meant he was in a situation with incurable , unbearable suffering			0
@entity211 suffering for euthanasia can be both physical and psychological			2
' this was a case that clearly met the conditions demanded by the law			0
@entity7 underwent counseling for six months			2
' last week it emerged that a staggering one in 30 deaths in the @entity61 are now from euthanasia , after @entity61 government allowed mobile death squads to kill sick and elderly people in their homes			2
