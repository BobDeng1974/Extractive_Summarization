conducted in september as part of a programme assessing child protection throughout @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity10 inspectors expressed concern at cases in which children were being unnecessarily detained in police custody overnight			1
the 16 - year - old girl refused food or water for 44 hours before police took her to hospital , the report revealed giving details of ' the most serious case ' seen by inspectors , in which a 16 - year - old was detained for 52 hours before being taken to hospital , the report said : ' it was only after the girl had been in custody for 44 hours that custody staff realised that she had gone without food or water			1
' she was subsequently treated by a paramedic before being taken to hospital			2
' the force was fully aware of the circumstances of this case , which was subject to an independent health service review at the time of the inspection , but it was not clear to inspectors that steps had been taken to learn the lessons			2
' in a statement , @entity1 said the girl , who was in custody under mental health laws for her own protection , had declined the offer of food and water on several occasions			0
@entity55 ( pictured ) said it was clear @entity1 needed to do more to improve its approach to protecting children assistant chief constable @entity59 said the force recognised that people in crisis due to mental health should not be in police custody			1
mr @entity59 said : ' we never want to be in a position where children need to be taken into custody , whether for crimes or because of mental health issues , and we continue to work with our partners to find alternative accommodation wherever possible			2
' a full review into the case of the 16 - year - old girl who was arrested has been conducted			0
' doctors and nurses assessed her welfare , and she was deemed to require specialist mental health assistance , and attempts were made over many hours to find appropriate accommodation			0
' @entity55 said : ' it is clear that despite good work in many areas , @entity1 needs to do more to improve its approach to protecting children			0
' we found some areas of practice that are uniformly good , for example , the management of sex offenders			0
' however there is often a lack of effective supervision of child protection investigations , which sometimes results in unacceptable delays and an inconsistent approach across the force			0
' i encourage @entity1 to act on our recommendations as a matter of urgency , and i have asked that within six weeks it provides me with an action plan to demonstrate how it will take forward our recommendations for improvement			0
' the report noted police staff responsible for managing child abuse investigations in @entity111 were highly committed and dedicated to providing good outcomes for children .			1
