@entity12 said mediation avoided ‘ traumatic ’ courtroom struggles , adding : ‘ all too often money is wasted on hearings that can take far too long to resolve			2
’ speeding things up : a mediated divorce tends to finish within four months , a quarter of the time of a non-mediated split the extra money means mediation will be subsidised to the tune of £ 25million this year			1
