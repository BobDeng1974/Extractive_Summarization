thumping tunes rang out from @entity13 under @entity14 while inside people bounced around wearing neon clothing and waving glow - sticks			1
however there was n't a hint of an illegal drug in the air - as the only high these ravers craved was the rush of endorphins from exercising			2

the high energy class lasts an hour with participants following the moves of three teachers on stage			2
