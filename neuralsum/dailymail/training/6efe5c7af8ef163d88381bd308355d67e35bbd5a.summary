@entity0 does n't believe @entity2 's injury will change @entity4 's fortunes			1
the Â£ 42.5million @entity5 has been ruled out until early next year after tearing his knee ligaments			1
but @entity0 believes the loss will not hamper @entity4 's system and pointed to the return of @entity10 as cause for celebration			1
@entity0 says @entity4 might not miss @entity2 as he has been playing out wide and not in the middle @entity10 ( left , who has returned from injury ) and @entity15 can make their mark now ' @entity2 was playing on the left a bit so it probably wo n't change much in the centre , ' he said			1
' @entity15 will get a chance			0
@entity10 is coming back as well			2
now it might give @entity10 or @entity22 a chance			2
' we are devastated for @entity2 because he can play in that number 10 ( role ) , we have seen what he can do at number 10			1
we have players who can come in			0
' despite backing @entity32 's side to strive on , @entity0 - no stranger to the treatment room himself - expressed his sympathy for @entity2			1
' it 's tough to take but it is part and parcel of football			0
i have had my fair few injuries , ' he said			0
' it is not a curse , it happens and you just have to deal with it			0
' it will be hard for him [ @entity2 ] because he likes football , he has never really had an injury before			2
he had a slight one last season			2
' i am not even sure how long it is , i 've not been back to the club			0
it will be difficult for him			0
but he is naturally quite a fit lad so he will be alright			0
' @entity2 ( left , showing his frustation in the defeat against @entity54 ) could be out for three months with a knee injury @entity0 dribbles past @entity56 during the game between @entity4 and @entity54 at @entity58 @entity59 out for up to 12 weeks with knee injury			1

@entity0 says @entity4 might not miss injured *playmaker* @entity2
@entity2 was playing out wide for the @entity63 and not his usual no 10 role
@entity5 may miss three months of season with knee ligament injury
@entity10 is back training and *nearing* a return after nine months out
