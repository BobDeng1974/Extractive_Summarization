but this photograph shows that he maintained close ties to @entity19 , who is accused in court papers of procuring underage girls for @entity3 , her former boyfriend , as she smiles as president @entity2 walks a beaming @entity25 down the aisle			1
for @entity19 to remain a @entity2 chum is an interesting turn of events			2
just two years earlier , her former lover and friend @entity3 was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after pleading to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution			1
he served 13 months in prison			2
president @entity2 had been so close to both to @entity3 he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on his private @entity60 island			1
speaking to the @entity63 in 2011 , @entity61 - who claims in court papers she was kept as @entity3 's ' sex slave ' and forced to sleep with prince @entity65 three times - said she met president @entity2 twice , but was never ' lent out '			1
@entity67 vehemently denies the claims , as does @entity19			1
her legal team stresses she was not involved in , or connected to the criminal proceedings against @entity3 and with regards to @entity61 ' claims , they stressed she denies each and every allegation			0
@entity45 , now a married mother of three , claimed that president @entity2 traveled with @entity3 to a number of destinations , including three times on the billionaire ’s private jet , and enjoyed intimate dinners with both him and @entity19			1

@entity3 , who has donated more than £ 75,000 over the years to candidates from the @entity93 , also flew with president @entity2 in november 2003 to destinations including @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
on one occasion , she alleged , @entity3 did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his island for president @entity2 shortly after he left office			2
but , as far as she knows , the ex-president did not take the bait			0
mysterious : @entity6 beams as her ex-lover , disgraced billionaire @entity3 hugs her as they attend a @entity109 bash on march 15 , 2005 - the same day @entity111 police launched an investigation into his abuse of underage girls ‘ i ’d have been about 17 at the time , ’ she said : ‘ i flew to the @entity60 with @entity3 and then @entity6 went to pick up @entity116 in a huge black helicopter that @entity3 had bought her			1
‘ she ’d always wanted to fly and @entity3 paid for her to take lessons , and i remember she was very excited because she got her licence around the first year we met			0
' i used to get frightened flying with her but @entity116 had the @entity124 with him and i remember him talking about what a good job she did			0
‘ i only ever met @entity116 twice but @entity3 had told me that they were good friends			0
' i asked , “ how come ? ” and he laughed and said , “ he owes me some favours			0
” maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as @entity116 and [ @entity65 ] @entity65 were n’t more careful			0
' she said that when dining that night , @entity19 sat at president @entity2 's left , while they were joined by two ' olive - skinned brunettes ' who had been flown in from @entity138			1
@entity45 claimed : ' i ’d never met them before			0
i ’d say they were no older than 17 , very innocent - looking			0
‘ they were n’t there for me			0
they were n’t there for @entity3 or @entity6 because i was there to have sex with @entity3 on the trip			2
‘ maybe @entity3 thought they would entertain @entity116 , but i saw no evidence that he was interested in them			0
he and @entity151 and @entity6 seemed to have a very good relationship			0
@entity116 was very funny ' he made me laugh a few times			0
and he and @entity151 and @entity6 told blokey jokes and the brunettes listened politely and giggled			0

as @entity61 ' astonishing claims have made headlines around the world , it was reported last week that president @entity2 's continuing friendship with @entity19 has caused a rift between him and his wife , potential presidential candidate @entity179			1
however , the pair were pictured looking cosy together as they left the funeral of former @entity138 governor @entity183			0
