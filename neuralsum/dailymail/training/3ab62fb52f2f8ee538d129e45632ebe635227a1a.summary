by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 09:01 est , 7 june 2012 referendum : lord @entity2 says the deepening eurozone crisis means that @entity4 should be asked urgently whether the @entity4 is better off out of the @entity5 @entity4 has the perfect opportunity to break from the ' shackles ' imposed by @entity8 as members like @entity10 close ranks to form a ' single country called @entity12 ' , former labour foreign secretary @entity2 has said			1
and to ensure @entity4 looks after itself , the electorate must be asked two simple questions , would the @entity4 be better off leaving the @entity5 , or staying and joining the euro , he said			1
as the eurozone faces its biggest ever crisis , he said now is the perfect time to act decisively over the @entity4 's future in @entity12			2
' a referendum on the future of @entity12 is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest , ' he wrote in @entity23			0
it came as chancellor @entity25 again resisted calls for a snap in - out referendum			2
today @entity4 's foreign secretary from 1977 - 79 said the @entity4 would be better off cutting links with @entity8 to join a wider single market to include @entity33 members like @entity34 and @entity35 , which he calls the ' @entity38 '			1
this , he told @entity23 , has to happen because @entity4 's vision for an @entity5 of no further integration and @entity10 's wish for near - complete integration are incompatible			1
@entity2 , who is the most senior @entity4 political figure to back a referendum so far , believes @entity46 members are squeezing together to form a group that is ' to all intents and purposes , though not in name , a single government			1
' posing for the cameras : prime minister @entity52 poses with @entity10 chancellor @entity53 and @entity55 prime minister @entity54 on the roof terrace of the @entity57 in @entity58 stage - managed stroll : the trio of @entity54 , @entity53 and @entity52 come over all @entity61 on the roof of the @entity63 ' in the @entity4 , but also in some other countries , there are growing public demands for a consistent position to resist any further merging of the two models , because the people in these countries to remain self - governing , in that they are determined to retain their own currency and remain in control of their own foreign , defence and fiscal policies , ' he said			1
' yet these same countries see the argument for greater integration within the eurozone to help resolve the continued crisis			0
the way these issues can be resolved @entity12 - wide is to enable those countries who wish to integrate further to do so and allow those countries who do not ever envisage becoming part of the eurozone to remain in a restructured single market			2
' key areas that have been handed over to @entity8 in the past , like agriculture and fishing as well as foreign , security and defence policy , would go straight back to @entity97 , he said reforms : @entity99 @entity25 is said to be pro-referendum but today he refused to be drawn on an urgent vote as the eurozone reshapes itself to survive @entity2 makes these warnings in his new book , ' @entity104 ' , which says @entity52 and @entity105 will have to promise one between now and 2016			1
chancellor @entity25 , who is also @entity52 's campaign adviser , is said privately to be backing a referendum as a huge proportion of @entity109 members want it written into their 2015 general election manifesto			0
but speaking this morning he resisted @entity2 's calls saying that a vote would only be triggered if @entity4 sovereignty was threatened and the question would be based on an individual treaty , not a straight in - out poll			1
' the @entity4 people would be concerned if there was any transfer of power , ' he told @entity122 's @entity121			0
' a reshaped relationship with @entity12 would involve a transfer of sovereignty or powers to @entity8			0
i think we have a very clear safeguard in the system now , thanks to this government , which is , if there is any transfer of power from this country , transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the @entity5 then there will be a referendum			0
' that is not something that happened at the time of the @entity147 treaty and the constitution , that ’s not something that happened at the time of the @entity153 treaty			0
' we have now put right that , ensuring in law there is this referendum lock , and as i say , people did not really notice the passage of this law about a year ago , but i think it ’s one of the most significant things this government has done			0
' @entity109 @entity163 , co-chair of the @entity165 group of mps , said the euro crisis was a ' perfect opportunity ' to renegotiate @entity4 ’s position in the @entity5			1
' this is n’t about profiting from the eurozone ’s hardship - it ’s about facing up to the reality of the damage the @entity5 is doing to our economy and our civil society and showing the single - mindedness to do something about it , ' she wrote in the @entity181			2
her plan would involve the ' nuclear option ' of defying @entity5 rules if it was in the interests of the @entity4			2
@entity109 @entity186 will attempt to use a private member ’s bill to repeal the legislation which led to the @entity4 joining the @entity5			1
he said : ' getting @entity4 out of the @entity5 is legally straightforward			0
economically , it is increasingly desirable			0
' politically , it is no longer easy to dismiss as pie - in - the - sky			0
' meanwhile with the eurozone in meltdown @entity52 will tell @entity10 leader today @entity53 to put her country 's full weight behind an ‘ immediate ’ rescue plan for the euro or start planning for the break - up of the single currency			1
' shackles ' : @entity4 has the chance to break from @entity8 , @entity2 says , and take back many of its policy decisions in the process the prime minister is due in @entity58 for crisis talks with the @entity10 chancellor as fears grow about the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone because @entity212 is edging closer to a £ 100billion bailout of its banks and is running out of money			1
mr @entity25 said today the decision on whether to use bailout funds to bailout @entity212 banks would not involve @entity4 taxpayers ' money			2
' first of all it ’s eurozone money , and the reason that ’s important for me and for this country is that it is not @entity4 taxpayers ’ money , and as a result i think we have to respect the fact the eurozone need to make their own decisions about how exactly they get money into the @entity212 banks , and the conditions they attach to that			0
' @entity212 need to restructure their banking system , they need the resources to do that , and how exactly that is done , as i say , must be a matter for the @entity212 government and the eurozone			0

lord @entity2 says @entity10 is racing towards ' a single @entity12 government in all but name '
therefore @entity4 must be asked : ' will the @entity4 be better off leaving the @entity5 or staying and joining the euro ? ' , he says
@entity4 could leave for a larger ' @entity38 ' , he says
@entity25 today again resists calls for an in - out vote
