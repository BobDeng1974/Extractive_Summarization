@entity1 militants and sympathisers are triumphantly circulating images of a 10 - year - old boy they claim has been ' martyred ' while fighting alongside his father in @entity6			1
describing the child as @entity9 ' youngest jihadist , chilling photographs taken before his alleged death show him smiling at the camera , wearing military fatigues and brandishing a huge assault rifle			1
@entity9 sympathisers took to social media to identify the ' cub fighter ' by his alleged nom de guerre @entity18 , adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in @entity6 in recent weeks , but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against			1
he is said to have died fighting alongside his father in @entity6 in recent weeks pose : another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars misled : @entity18 posing with a man understood to be his father , who militants named as ' @entity41 ' several images , which have not been independently verified , emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to @entity47 in september			1
the original video - distributed by the @entity50 media group @entity49 - is understood to have since been removed , but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by @entity9 militants and their sympathisers on social media			2
one image shows the boy standing inside a house , grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over			0
another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars			0
other images show him posing with a man understood to be his father , who militants named as ' @entity41 '			1

support : @entity9 sympathisers are triumphantly circulating images of a 10 - year - old boy they claim has been ' martyred ' with while fighting alongside his father in @entity6 smiling : describing the child as @entity9 ' youngest foreign jihadist , chilling photographs taken before his alleged death show him grinning at the camera , wearing military fatigues and brandishing a huge assault rifle @entity9 - which rebranded as @entity1 earlier this year after establishing a self - described caliphate in the vast swaths of @entity6 and @entity92 under its control - has long groomed children to take part in jihad			1
the practice was the subject of the second episode of @entity101 's groundbreaking ' @entity1 ' documentary series			0
the film showed very young boys being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist when they grow up , and being forced to recite calls for the murder of @entity110 ' infidels '			0
in the footage , @entity9 ' pr man @entity112 - who has since been killed - describes how every male child under the age of 15 is forced to attend a ' @entity117 camp ' to be taught the militant group 's radical interpretation of @entity120			2
at the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp , where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare			0
after that they are prepared for possible future as either front - line militia or suicide bombers			0
last week a 24 - year - old muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among @entity1 terrorists in the @entity6 city of @entity134 because she believes he will lead a ' better life ' under their brutal regime			1
@entity138 denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of @entity9 ' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three - year - old son 's spiritual well - being was better served in the group 's de facto capital , where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace			1
@entity149 - who had lived in @entity150 since her teens but was born in @entity152 - said moving to the militant stronghold in @entity6 was in part to shield the young boy from the sex , crime , drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town @entity161			1
' who says children here are unhappy ? ... he will know @entity166 and live under his rules , ' she said			0
@entity1 militants have carried out mass executions , set up slave markets where women are sold for sex for $ 10 and used child soldiers in what may amount to systematic war crimes in @entity92 that demand prosecution , the @entity168 reported last week			2
investigators believe as many as 2,500 women and children have been captured , subjected to sex attacks and then sold for around $ 10 by extremist militants in @entity92			0
in august , @entity9 is believed to have taken 450 - 500 women and girls to the @entity186 citadel in @entity92 's @entity187 where ' 150 unmarried girls and women , predominantly from the @entity190 and @entity192 communities , were reportedly transported to @entity6 , either to be given to @entity9 fighters as a reward or to be sold as sex slaves '			2
according to investigators , slave markets have been set up in @entity134 , @entity6 and the @entity199 area of @entity200 in @entity92 - partly to attract new @entity1 fighters			1
dramatic footage has emerged from inside @entity203 showing brave @entity205 fighters battling against militants from the @entity1			0
the clip , which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone , shows resistance forces from the @entity209 ( @entity210 ) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the @entity203 suburbs			1
the terrorists launched a renewed assault on @entity203 last night , killing dozens of @entity220 who have resisted @entity9 ' advances into the city 's suburbs over the last three weeks			0
defence : @entity9 terrorists launched a renewed assault on @entity203 last night , killing dozens of @entity220 who have resisted @entity9 ' advances into the city 's suburbs over the last three weeks prepared : a @entity205 fighter takes up his position to fight the @entity1 jihadists @entity1 militants are now in control of one third of the besieged @entity6 city of @entity203 despite three days of @entity240 airstrikes , a group monitoring violence in the country said today			1
this morning the chilling sight of the group 's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city ; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by @entity240 and @entity251 warplanes			0
while the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city , @entity9 fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of @entity203 , where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre			0
news of @entity9 ' gains came as the @entity264 admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of @entity203 , raising serious questions over the @entity240 's wider campaign against the terror group			0
still flying : this morning the chilling sight of the group 's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city ; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by @entity240 and @entity251 warplanes dramatic : the escalation in @entity203 has seen the @entity240 and @entity251 coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the @entity1 in northern @entity6 started two weeks ago rear admiral @entity280 , the @entity264 press secretary , said airstrikes are ' not going to be enough to save that city ' , amid growing concern that without @entity110 ground troops being sent into @entity6 , the defeat of @entity9 will prove a near impossible task			2
heavily outgunned @entity205 defenders said @entity1 militants had pushed into two districts of @entity203 - a mainly @entity205 border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night			2
@entity291 said the @entity240 military and @entity251 partner nations responded to @entity9 renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night , adding that for now the city remains under @entity205 control			0
the @entity299 - based @entity298 this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes , which have continued into this morning , @entity1 fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of @entity203 and now control one third of the city .			2
