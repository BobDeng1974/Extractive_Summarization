he was convicted in 2002 for second degree murder but an @entity20 judge has dismissed the charges the 31 - year - old was not @entity12 's biological father , but helped @entity16 raise him and had given the child his last name , according to @entity26			1
mr @entity9 said wednesday that he was overcome with joy knowing the case was finally closed for good			0
' i can start my life over again , ' he told the @entity31			0

court records showed that @entity12 had suffered from severe health problems and had been in and out of the hospital during his short life span			1

police and hospital officials originally decided upon @entity12 's death in 2000 that the infant 's eye and brain injuries were caused by violent shaking and the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide			1
