it was n't until i moved to @entity2 , where league and union enjoy a far friendlier allegiance than in the @entity6 , that i realised just how special rugby league players can be			1
playing for @entity9 , we used to train closely with our league equivalent , the @entity9 , and play a pretty physical version of touch rugby in the park on sundays			1
their basic skill - set is remarkable and the format of the sport amplifies the need for either standout speed or raw power — both of which make for outstanding athletes			0
i ’m always intrigued to see how league converts adapt to union and @entity26 has every opportunity to be a blockbuster hit for @entity29 and @entity30			1
rugby league players often bring a remarkable and original skill - set when they move across to union @entity26 should be played at inside centre for @entity30 , alongside @entity35 he has just been named the world ’s best player in the league code and appears to have a remarkable effect on all those he works with			1
there is no question that we have a phenomenal athlete and strong character entering @entity48 rugby			0
if @entity30 can build their offensive game around @entity26 , he has the potential to deliver on the biggest stage — and turn his country ’s attack on its head			1
the big question is , where do you play him ? most of the successful converts have either played on the wing or at full back			0
but @entity26 does not have the pace to play in the back three			1
nor do i see him being any better than our current crop of forwards — so he must be played at inside centre			1
he can not be involved in the autumn internationals because of injury , but @entity71 must bring him into the squad at the earliest opportunity			1
the midfield is the biggest question mark over the @entity30 starting xv			1
its outcome after the autumn internationals and @entity79 will have a huge impact on the @entity81			1
@entity71 can not afford to leave @entity26 out of his squad for the @entity81 @entity26 has earned his stripes playing rugby league and should n't have to prove himself all over again @entity26 must be encouraged to play his natural game , rather than try to mould himself overnight into a ‘ textbook 12 ’			1
he will learn union in time , but it ’s important it comes on top of what he already has			0
this is where @entity92 was so successful with @entity30 and @entity2 ’s @entity94 entered the sport in similar fashion			1
they backed their skill - set and continued doing what they did best in league , effectively forcing opponents to adapt to them — not the other way round			0
@entity30 already have a physical midfield			2
they have been playing big guys like @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity35 ; but no one comes bigger or more ferocious than @entity26			2
he ’s not going to turn out like @entity109 or @entity110 — both natural playmakers who relied on vision more than physicality — but he has the ability to draw in three or four players at a time			0
@entity26 playing alongside @entity35 would be interesting to watch ! @entity26 moved to @entity29 after helping the @entity118 win their first @entity120 title in 43 years @entity92 proved a huge success after making the switch from league to union @entity125 or @entity126 wo n’t be afraid of his size , but they will be afraid of his passing and off - loading			1
many underestimate just how good league players ’ basic skills are			0
if @entity30 can work out a way of exploiting that then they could be on to something very special			2
@entity30 have some solid options at 12 , but none of them make you go ‘ wow ’			2
that ’s where @entity26 is different			2
if @entity71 can slot him into that spot alongside a fly - half brave enough to stand flat , and with the footwork and touch to find him some clean air , then that 10 - 12 combination would ask a lot of any defence			2
@entity26 could be used to release the entire back line ; this was the most significant effect of @entity151 for the @entity152			2
most players only get the chance to play in one @entity81 and my concern is that he is held back until 2019			0
that would lead to a lot of ‘ what ifs ’ and ‘ if onlys ’ if @entity30 go on to lose in the semi-final or the final next year			0
you have to throw everything at next year ’s @entity81			0
this guy could be what @entity30 are missing			0
i admire the culture @entity168 has created in the @entity30 camp , where you have to earn your stripes			0
but @entity26 has earned his call - up with what he has already achieved in league			1
would the other players want him there ? absolutely			0
when @entity92 arrived he lifted the whole camp ; he turned a very good team into a really scary team			0
you get no second chances at the @entity81 .			0

@entity26 has made the switch from rugby league to union
*sir* @entity187 feels he would be the *perfect* addition for @entity30
@entity26 should be used at inside centre for @entity30
@entity71 can not afford not to take him to the @entity81
