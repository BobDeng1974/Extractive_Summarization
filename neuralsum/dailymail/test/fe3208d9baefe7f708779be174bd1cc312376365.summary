@entity1 interim chairman @entity0 insisted on thursday night the actions of previous boardroom regimes were ‘ solely ’ to blame for the club ’s stock exchange removal			1
the @entity7 outfit will be forced to delist from the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) after being unable to secure a new nominated advisor ( @entity10 ) to meet regulations			1
@entity0 insists the new board ’s plans for the future will be unaffected and that planned investments will still take place			1
@entity1 interim chairman @entity0 insists the actions of previous boardroom regimes were ‘ solely ’ to blame for the club ’s stock exchange removal however , the development has reopened old hostilities , with @entity20 claiming the shareholder group he heads is considering legal action			1
the former football board chairman also accused @entity24 of making ‘ misleading ’ statements			1
trading in @entity1 shares was suspended when previous @entity10 , @entity28 , resigned just two days before the march 6 egm that ousted the old board and handed control to @entity24 and his allies			1
discussions between incoming directors and a potential @entity10 replacement were already underway at that point			0
it ’s understood , however , that they subsequently broke down after the @entity8 hierarchy indicated a wish to dispense with @entity1 altogether , unhappy at the level of turmoil witnessed since its initial listing in december 2012			1
the club was the subject of more complaints than any other company on the market over the past 12 months			0
the @entity7 outfit have not disclosed the name of the @entity10 with whom they held talks but are adamant the firm was happy to approve chairman - in - waiting @entity24 and all current directors as ‘ fit and proper ’			2
@entity24 and the @entity57 consortium are expected to be among the investors in a new share issue this summer to provide a longer - term financial solution at the club			0
@entity1 now plan to be listed on the @entity63 market , which @entity64 currently use , by the end of next month			1
@entity68 firm @entity66 will provide an interim service for those seeking to buy or sell a stake in the club			2
‘ we tried everything within our power to have the suspension lifted but it was clear that we would have to pay a price for years of poor corporate governance and financial mismanagement since the ipo ( in 2012 ) , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the delisting is down solely to the actions and conduct of past regimes			0
‘ you could say the behaviour of previous directors has poisoned the well with @entity8 but even so we might have expected a little more understanding from certain quarters			1
however , i must point out that delisting will have no effect on our overall financial strategy			0
@entity0 insists the new board ’s plans for the future will be unaffected by the stock exchange removal ‘ the investments we expect will still be made and @entity1 will be rebuilt on schedule			1
be certain that this delisting , which is down entirely to the actions of previous boards , will have no bearing on future investment			2
‘ it is unfortunate our intended @entity10 , who had confirmed to us that they cleared all of the individuals concerned as fit and proper , could not proceed after having conducted due diligence on the company but i want to stress again that this will not hinder our plans			2
’ @entity24 had stated the day before the @entity29 that he intended to appoint the @entity10 he had lined up ‘ immediately ’ but added the caveat that the firm would have to look ‘ under the boot ’ at @entity1 before accepting the position			1
the fact none has been appointed led to an outcry from the @entity120 camp , which controls a 20 per cent stake in the club			0
‘ i can confirm that the @entity120 grouping is considering legal action , ’ said a spokesman			0
‘ this cessation of listing is a blow to all serious shareholders and is in direct contradiction to the promises mr @entity24 made in the lead up to the egm regarding appointment of a nomad			0
’ @entity20 was later asked by @entity136 whether he felt @entity24 had misled supporters , replying : ‘ i think , categorically , we have been misled			0
@entity24 said in several interviews that he had a @entity10 and felt comfortable that the company would still be listed			0
’ on the subject of potential legal action , @entity20 said he did n’t think the group would ‘ be taking @entity1 to task ’ but could look ‘ more on a personal basis , with the individuals who misled the shareholders in thinking shares would still be on @entity8 ’			1
fan ownership groups have , however , backed @entity24 and the new board			2
‘ it is clear that some who remain supportive of the previous regime are attempting to portray this issue as being a broken promise by the new board , ’ said a spokesman for the @entity151			2
‘ we do not adhere to that view and do not believe it stands up to any sensible scrutiny			0
we are entirely satisfied that the new board has done everything it could to maintain the @entity8 listing and we are happy that they did not in any way mislead shareholders by stating that they had a @entity10 willing to work with them			1
‘ it was made clear by the new board that any @entity10 ’s involvement would be subject to due diligence on the company itself			0
in fact , we are aware that more than one @entity10 was willing to clear the current and prospective directors as fit and proper			0
the only barriers to a continued listing have been the reputational damage done by the complete absence of corporate governance of previous boards and the reluctance of the @entity8 regulator to allow a new nomad to take position			2
’ a statement from @entity185 added : ‘ the delisting is simply the result of well - documented failings in corporate governance and management of those who previously controlled the @entity192			0
‘ in addition , we note positively that an alternative listing is being sought and that an immediate solution has already been put in place from tuesday that will allow buying and selling of @entity198 shares			0
