by @entity0 @entity1 : 23:07 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:12 est , 18 december 2013 citizenship : @entity4 was given honorary citizenship of @entity6 in @entity7 back in 1933 a small town in @entity9 has tried and failed to revoke the honorary citizenship awarded to @entity11 back in 1933			1
the vote by the councillors in the town of @entity6 in @entity7 - the state where @entity15 was born - is an embarrassment that shows the sneaking admiration that some in @entity9 continue to harbour for the dictator 68 years after his death in @entity21			1
thousands upon thousands of communities in @entity9 fell at @entity4 's feet when he became @entity11 and chancellor , giving him the keys to the city , sending him gifts and making him an honary dignitary			2
to this day an average of five municipalities a month delve into their archives , see that the mass murderer is still on their books and then vote to remove him			1
mayor @entity37 thought it was about time @entity6 did the same after town hall archivist @entity39 found @entity4 was still a top dog in town dating back to march 1933 , the month he came to power			1
the nearby town of @entity44 carried out a similar vote a few days earlier which passed without discussion			2
but the town councillors of @entity6 refused to fall into line			1
' it would be a distortion of history , the whole debate is laughable , ' said council member @entity53			0
another member @entity54 said : ' @entity56 citizenship goes with death			0
it is all a very long time ago			0
' and a third council member asked : ' can we not distance ourselves from living politicians ? that would be much wiser			0
' in the end eight councillors voted to kick @entity4 off the vip list , and eight voted to keep him			2
@entity9 media had a field day at the town 's expense			0
' it does n't get more stupid than this , ' said local governor @entity73			0
' fascism is too important a topic for stupid political games			0
' ' honorary citizen ' : @entity6 in @entity7 - the state where @entity15 was born - has @entity4 as an honorary citizen			1

vote by the councillors in the town of @entity6 in @entity7
@entity4 given honorary citizenship in 1933
