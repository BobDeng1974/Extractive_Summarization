deputy pm @entity0 says he is ' delighted ' by their arrival the first giant pandas to arrive in @entity4 for 17 years touched down at @entity5 yesterday after an 11 - hour flight from @entity7 on a specially - chartered jet			1
now , as @entity10 and @entity11 settle into their luxury enclosure and eager fans clamour to see them , hopes are high they could produce the first ever panda cub born on @entity4 soil			1
here , @entity17 looks at what lies in store for these very special creatures			0
a pair of international celebrities completed their much - anticipated move to @entity5 last night , where they are now occupying £ 275,000 suites and having their organic food flown in from the continent			1
they were met on @entity29 soil by photographers , dignitaries and crowds of flag - waving locals clamouring for a glimpse of them			0
earlier this week , a website selling tickets to see the pair crashed due to the demand			2
but , in a departure from the usual celebrity script , the new arrivals are a pair of giant pandas			1
the pair are the first giant pandas to arrive in the @entity4 for more than 17 years @entity10 , left , and @entity11 , right , settle in at @entity5			1
they arrived at the zoo from a conservation centre in @entity58 , @entity7 , on a private @entity60 flight dubbed the ‘ @entity61 ’ yesterday , female @entity51 ( meaning @entity11 ) and male @entity46 ( @entity10 ) arrived in @entity5 from a conservation centre in @entity58 , @entity7 , on a private @entity60 flight dubbed the ‘ @entity61 ’ , along with a vet and two animal handlers			1
they are on loan from @entity7 for the next ten years			1
bagpipes played as the bears were carried carefully from the aircraft in individual crates , each labelled ‘ one panda ’ and taken to @entity5			1
@entity51 and @entity46 have been put in enclosures designed by animal psychologists , which come complete with dens , private pools , a viewing platform and a room where the pandas will be given health check - ups			2
the new arrivals are unloaded from their @entity61 plane following an 11 - hour journey from @entity7 new home : @entity46 is unloaded from the freight aircraft by two @entity61 staff members welcome : people waited with anticipation to receive @entity51 and and @entity46 as their plane touched down the enclosure also has a specially built ‘ love tunnel ’ where the two can meet if they are feeling amorous , and a nursery for any offspring			1
zoo bosses believe the pandas will attract more than a million extra visitors , and a baby panda would see numbers boom even further - although any cubs would be the property of @entity7			1
already there is eager adulation from the panda - mad public			0
earlier this week , the zoo ’s ticket website was unable to cope with the ‘ sheer influx ’ of people trying to book tickets and crashed			0
but then this pair are rare treasures : these are the first pandas in the @entity4 for 17 years , since @entity116 hosted @entity117 and @entity118 in the early nineties			1
and the bears will need to be popular in order to fund their keep			0
the zoo is paying the @entity7 around £ 636,000 a year for the privilege of having them			1
it also needs to buy them £ 70,000 worth of bamboo a year			0
the bears will now have a fortnight to settle in before being put on show to the public			0
although they have come as a pair , they will have separate rooms as solitary pandas only meet to mate once a year			1
excited : a youngster wore a panda hat and joined hundreds of other well - wishers to catch a first sighting of the giant bears at the airport their new living quarters are five - star			2
the animals love to clamber , so each has a climbing frame that will enable them to see each other over the tops of their enclosures			0
the animal psychologists also designed the accommodation to simulate their natural habitat			0
small caves are intended as outdoor bedrooms			0
there are his ’ n ’ hers ponds and shaped rocks that act like panda - recliners , so they can lie back to chew on their bamboo			0
@entity167 , the pandas ’ head - keeper , is delighted with the enclosure ’s design			1
‘ it ’s perfect , ’ she says			0
‘ the visitors have huge viewing panels , both looking into the interior and exterior of the enclosures			0
it ’s virtually soundproof , so the pandas wo n’t get disturbed			2
’ pandas spend much of their time munching - as much as 14 hours a day chewing bamboo			2
each year , they will eat up to 18,000kg ( over 39,000lb ) of the stuff - around 20 three - metre stems a day			2
this is no ordinary bamboo , either			0
most of it will be imported from a specialist organic grower on a plantation just outside @entity189			0
after all , you do n’t want to let pandas get hungry			2
they can get very bearish			0
in 2009 , for example , a giant panda killed eight sheep in a village near a nature reserve in @entity198 in @entity7			1
first sight : @entity7 panda @entity46 at @entity48 arrival : giant pandas @entity51 ( @entity11 ) and @entity46 ( @entity10 ) arrive at @entity48 on the @entity203 touch down : the @entity203 lands at @entity48 in captivity , they have been known to maul humans			1
even when well - fed , pandas are not completely herbivore			2
around one per cent of their diet is carnivore — popular snacks are rats , mice and insects			0
the one mod - con the pandas should not need is climate control			2
the weather in @entity5 is very similar to that of their native @entity58			1
with all the right conditions , @entity5 ’s zoo keepers hope that the pampered pandas will be in the mood for love			1
the conservation purpose of their decade - long stay is to produce offspring that can be returned to the wild			2
ten years is a significant proportion of a captive panda ’s lifespan : they are normally expected to live for 30 years			1
hopes are high that their stay will prove fruitful : @entity51 and @entity46 have both successfully mated before , but with other partners			0
while pandas are notoriously difficult to mate in captivity , @entity51 and @entity46 are said to stand a better chance than most of producing young			2
the ‘ boisterous ’ male , @entity46 , is said to be better endowed than the average panda			0
he has already sired a string of cubs in the @entity247 reserve in @entity7 , where both pandas were born and raised			1
and although @entity51 , has been described as ‘ a very quiet and nervous character ’ , she has given birth to two cubs			0
through the keyhole : @entity46 is seen eating bamboo branches through a whole of the @entity61 container transporting the pair to @entity5 nervous flyer ? @entity46 is fed with apples in the minutes before being loaded onto the plane to @entity29 heavy load : giant panda @entity46 is hauled onto the plane at @entity264 , ready for his trip to @entity29 special delivery : the @entity203 has special livery for the flight @entity269 , chief executive of the @entity29 zoological society , said he was ‘ very confident ’ the pandas would become the first in @entity4 to breed naturally			1
‘ they both know what to do and that ’s a start , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity46 ’s sexual prowess is in doubt			0
’ nevertheless , the last @entity4 attempt ended in an acrimonious divorce : @entity116 ’s @entity117 and @entity118 fought savagely and had to be separated			1
@entity117 was sent to @entity280 in 1993 and @entity118 returned to @entity7 in 1994			1
their predecessors had fared little better			0
in 1974 , the conservative prime minister , @entity283 , attempted to lighten the gloom of a @entity4 struck by economic crisis by bringing over @entity286 and @entity287 , in what was considered a coup of ‘ panda diplomacy ’ with the communist regime			1
but although the pair were loved by visitors to @entity116 , they did n’t seem to love each other , and were cubless to the end			2
loaded up : @entity51 sat peacefully in a cage , before being taken to the airport @entity300 ’ problems are exacerbated by the female ’s very short period of fertility			0
@entity304 , a spokeswoman for @entity5 zoo , says : ‘ they only have a period of three days a year when the female is receptive			1
within this , there is only a window of between 24 and 48 hours when she is fertile			0
’ worse still , male pandas can prove lackadaisical			0
in 2007 , keepers at @entity316 ’s @entity315 resorted to sitting a male called @entity318 in front of a tv showing raunchy videos of bears mating in an attempt to spark his interest			0
the chief veterinarian , @entity326 , was disappointed to admit ‘ @entity318 seemed indifferent ’ to the films			0
if @entity5 does hit the panda cub jackpot , then it would prove a welcome boost to conservation efforts : there are as few as 1,600 giant pandas in central @entity7			1
farewell party : a @entity7 woman sees off the pandas , who will have an extended stay in @entity5 fragile cargo : the bears are loaded into special crates before boarding a plane heading for @entity5 not everyone is a supporter , however			1
@entity344 , the @entity345 wildlife presenter , has said pandas should be allowed to die out and the money spent on conserving them should go on other species			0
his words outraged the @entity7 and threatened the loan deal for @entity51 and @entity46			1
but if a rare cub is produced , @entity5 can expect an unprecedented frenzy because there is something about these creatures that pulls the heart strings			2
for example , a video on @entity359 entitled @entity360 has been viewed 190 million times			0
if such an adorable creature were to be born in @entity5 , the visitor bonus to the nation would certainly not be worth sneezing at			2
@entity366 : @entity367 and @entity10 arrived in @entity29 after a 5,000 - mile journey from @entity7 bulking up : @entity10 pictured tucking into some bamboo in his enclosure before embarking on his journey going the distance : sweetie and her mate sunshine will be the first pandas to live in the @entity4 for 20 years			1

arrival of pair hailed as ' significant *chapter* ' in *relationship* between @entity7 and the @entity4
the pair are first giant pandas to arrive in @entity4 for nearly 20 years
they will live at @entity5 for at least a decade
deputy pm @entity0 says he is ' delighted ' by their arrival
