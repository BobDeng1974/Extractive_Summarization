the @entity0 has released a new propaganda video showing two deaf fighters speaking in sign language and urging more westerners to join the terror group			1
the video is titled ' from who excused [ sic ] to those not excused ' - suggesting that disability is no excuse for not serving for @entity12			0
in the five minute clip the two men , who are deaf - mutes and brothers , are shown working as traffic police in @entity19 's second city @entity20 , which has been under @entity12 control since last summer			1
' as for my message to the apostate peshmerga ( @entity55 fighters ) we will strike you soon , by @entity58 's permission			2
i am living in a land in which @entity58 's sharia is established			0
' wearing black jumpsuits , ammunition pouches and carrying what appear to be @entity66 assault rifles , the pair also speak about their desire to ' slaughter ' their enemies including @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , saying ' you will not stop our advance '			1
the fighters also threaten @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and those who have allied with the @entity82 , vowing to destroy them			0
in the final section of the slickly produced and professionally edited film , the brothers are shown assembling simple rocket launchers which they claim are used to fire at @entity55 fighters			1
the weapons consist of little more than crudely made explosives balanced on a metal frame which is tilted upwards and held in place using a few rocks			0
in the last seconds of the film , which features the @entity0 's logo in the top right hand corner , one of the men presses a trigger , launching the rockets			0
the last seconds of the film show the pair wiring up and launching two crude missiles which they claim are being aimed at @entity55 peshmerga fighters @entity105 , a researcher at @entity106 , who spoke to @entity107 , said the video ' represents an attempt by the group to recruit other physically or otherwise impaired individuals , as well as demonstrates the multifaceted responsibilities of those in its ranks			1
' @entity12 's ability to recruit western jihadis using online propaganda films and its monthly magazine , @entity119 , is well documented , and the films often feature fighters speaking about their daily lives , in an attempt to present life under the extremist caliphate in a positive light			0
however this is thought to be the first film which deliberately features disabled people in an attempt to recruit more from @entity131 and the @entity82 .			2

men claim to be deaf mute brothers working as traffic police in @entity20 , @entity19
they demonstrate their job while urging @entity131 @entity139 to go and fight
fighters pledge to ' slaughter ' @entity71 , @entity72 and their @entity144 allies
at the end of the film they are shown firing missiles at @entity55 troops
