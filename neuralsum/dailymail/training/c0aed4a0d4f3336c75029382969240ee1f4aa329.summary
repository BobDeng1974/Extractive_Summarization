by @entity0 a property developer has won a £ 167,000 legal battle with 11 of her neighbours after she became embroiled in a bitter boundary dispute - over a 9ft piece of land			1
@entity7 , 56 , claims she was subjected to a vicious seven - year hate campaign at the hands of villagers living in picturesque @entity11 , @entity12 , over the the small strip of grass			1
the mother - of - one moved onto two acres of land with her husband @entity17 - who has since died - in 1990 where they built two houses , one of which they moved into into 2006			1
victory : @entity7 , 56 , claims she was subjected to a seven - year hate campaign to reclaim her land dispute : the nine - foot strip of land between her house ( left ) and her neighbours ' consists mainly of weeds but since 2007 she has been locked in a turf war with locals over a small strip of grass behind her home - consisting mainly of nettles and a ditch			1
she took fellow villagers to @entity43 after deciding they were trespassing on her £ 270,000 detached property			1
those she challenged claimed they did nothing wrong and that the boundary was clearly marked on the deeds of their homes on @entity53			1
but following a lengthy row over the tiny plot of land six families have been forced to stump up £ 167,000 in damages and court costs following her victory			2
the dispute has shrunk each of their gardens by 9ft and every single penny of mrs @entity7 ’s £ 3,650 damages and her £ 92,000 legal costs has now been paid by them			1
additionally , the residents she challenged in the leafy village have also had to settle their own legal costs of at least £ 72,000			0
anger : while she claimed residents were trespassing , they claimed she was making them cut their gardens the court heard how the money has been paid through a combination of selling up , taking out loans , or claiming on home insurance			1
today , mrs @entity7 , a building project manager , who has since used some of the payout to erect a sturdy fence to reinforce the boundary , said : ' i claimed back what was rightfully mine			1
' this was and is my property and looking at the @entity89 records proved that			0
' we came to the village in 1990 and all we wanted was a quiet life - we had everything but that			2
' i have been on the receiving end of a fair bit of animosity and have been the victim of a nasty hate campaign			1
i would say i have been harassed by some members of this community			0
' they even held meetings in the village hall to discuss my land , i was very much ganged up on			2
' i claimed back what was rightfully mine			1
i have been harassed by some members of this community ' ' the problem is that if we had ever wanted to sell up we had people on our property			0
' my solicitor wrote to them in 2007 telling them to get off my land			2
' a summons was issued in 2010 and even after that they still had the chance to back down			2
' i have lived in the parish all my life and the action i took was justified			0
it took seven years because there was six properties but i ’ve finally done it			0
' i ’m just happy to be left alone and move on with my life , just live and let live and mind my own business			0
' mrs @entity7 and husband @entity17 , who died in 2011 , had claimed neighbours from nearby @entity53 had had extended their gardens onto her land ' without licence or consent '			1
but @entity135 heard that the defiant local residents still ' refused to withdraw ' two years ago successfully argued that the true boundary - once marked by a wire fence - lies about 4ft to the east of a dyke running parallel with @entity53			2
@entity141 , 66 , of @entity53 , said : ' we had done nothing wrong , but unfortunately the court has decided and we are out of pocket and garden space			2
mrs @entity7 and her late husband bought the land in @entity11 , @entity12 , in 1990 ' it was a nice village when we came 20 - something years ago , but now we want to move			1
we used to trim the hedges and tend to it and she just wants to build on it			0
' two of the couples involved have already moved out and i want to as well to be honest			0
i have lost my apple and pear tree because of this			0
' we ’ve felt driven off our land - even if it is a couple of metres - but its the principle that counts			1
' we had paperwork showing our land went down to the old fence			0
' his wife @entity165 said : ' i could not understand how the deeds were wrong			0
' this house has been here for 100 years , but the deeds are not worth the paper they are printed on			0
' neighbour and former parish councillor @entity172 added : ' the boundary is marked out on the deeds and it is a mystery to me how it got to this stage			0
