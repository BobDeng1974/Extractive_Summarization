two thug brothers are the first in the @entity2 to be banned from their own home after new laws were introduced to clamp down on neighbours from hell			1
@entity7 , 46 , and @entity8 , 44 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , have been evicted from their Â£ 93,000 privately - owned terraced property after a string of complaints from residents			1
@entity16 claimed the brothers ' home was being used as a drug den which was attracting addicts to the area			1
@entity22 and @entity8 have both been evicted from their house ( pictured ) in the @entity10 area of @entity11 under a new anti-social behaviour law following complaints from neighbours the brothers have been causing problems on the street for several years with neighbours complaining that the situation had become ' significantly worse ' in the last 12 months			1
police confirmed the pair have both been fined on several occasions for being drunk and disorderly			1
one of the brothers was also convicted of allowing the property to be used for heroin misuse in 2013			1
over a six - month period police and the local council compiled a damning dossier of evidence which was presented to @entity43 on november 14			2
the brothers were prosecuted under the new anti-social behaviour , @entity45 2014 , which came into force in october			2
as a result @entity47 have now banned them from entering their home for three months			1
yesterday the run - down property was sealed with steel shutters boarding up the door and windows			1
a blue sign was strung on the front of the house which stated : ' evicted			1
anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in @entity11			2
' now , anyone who attempts to enter the terraced house in the next three months will automatically be guilty of an offence and will be brought before the courts			1
councillor @entity62 ( pictured ) praised the commitment of staff from @entity65 and @entity66 and local residents for taking a stand against the two brothers sergeant @entity70 , from @entity66 , said : ' we 've worked closely with @entity65 to resolve this problem as swiftly as possible			2
' despite many attempts by officers to help the brothers to change their ways , their behaviour did not improve			0
' the impact on the community became so great that we had no choice other than to apply to the courts for a closure order and move them on			0
' such an order not only brings respite to the community but also allows the residents to make positive changes to their lives			0
' @entity91 will continue to closely monitor the situation and , if further problems arise , will tackle them immediately			0
' under the new powers , if the police or council are satisfied that a particular property is causing nuisance to neighbours , a notice can be served which limits access to the property for a specified period of time			1
the court can then support that notice by issuing a closure order for a period of three months which bans all access to the property			1
councillor @entity62 , cabinet member of social cohesion , equalities and community safety at @entity65 , said : ' i praise the commitment of staff from both @entity65 and @entity66 and local residents for taking a stand in this case			0
' we will continue to work in partnership with the police to use closure orders against any person who causes nuisance behaviour in this way to ensure our communities remain safe places to live			0
' the brothers are currently being housed in temporary council accommodation until the end of the three month ban			0
neighbours living close to the @entity8 brothers on @entity9 spoke of their relief at the pair being evicted			1
one , who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals , said : ' it 's an early @entity142 present for us on this street			1
' people in this area work hard , no one has much money but most are families with young kids			1
these two have been a cancer in this area			1
' the drug dealing and nightly visitors to the house makes living here almost unbearable			1
' it 's a pity they will only be gone for three months but at least it 's a start			2
' @entity160 , 41 , a house wife who lives opposite with her husband and three children , said : ' i have been here about 24 years and they have been here most of that time			2
' we had lots of problems with them bringing prostitutes round and dealing drugs			0
' all the time , you could see women coming up to the door and then leaving again			0
' @entity175 it had been getting worse			0
when they first came here one of them had a wife			0
' the men were loud and sometimes you would see them screaming in the street with people			2
' the police would often go round to his house but i do n't think they would usually go in			2
' i remember one time the police came and broke down the front door a couple of years ago , and there was lots of screaming and shouting on the street			2
that was one of the worst times			0
' mother - of - four @entity199 , 39 , said : ' i have been here for nearly 10 years , and with them here it has not made it a nice place to live			0
' we pay our taxes and are working , and trying to live our normal lives but early in the morning sometimes they would already be drunk and would have women coming over			1
' they had no consideration for the atmosphere of the community			0
' they have been raided twice and it is such a concern because i have daughters as well			0
' i have two boys and two girls , and one of my boys is 17 , but obviously i do n't want him hanging around with these local lads and getting into drugs			0
' those men have destroyed a lot of people 's lives by getting them into drugs			0
' they never said much to us because they knew we lived here , but for the last year - and - a - half the police have taken it very seriously , because i have been complaining for a long time			0
police and the local council compiled a damning dossier of evidence which was presented to @entity43 ( pictured ) - magistrates have now banned the brothers from the house for three months ' it was just dreadful , at 3am there would be scuffles and fights and sometimes you could even hear other neighbours shouting at them because it was so horrible			1
' there was no peace with them here , but the worst moment was when they were fighting out on the street by my house and i thought they might smash my car or house window			1
' i am trying to show my children the proper way to live , to earn a living and be honest , but then these people are just there causing trouble			0
' everything in their life is incorrect , they are selling drugs and being terrible role models			0
i know people who have left the area because of them , but i ca n't afford to			2
' i think their mother passed away and handed the house on , but they were just wasting away			2
' my friend came round to see me once , but as she got out of her car they even offered her drugs , i just could n't believe it			0
