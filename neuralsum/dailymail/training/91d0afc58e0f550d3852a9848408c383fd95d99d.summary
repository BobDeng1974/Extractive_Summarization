' attempts to claw back millions from security firm @entity28 for its failure to provide thousands of guards just weeks before the @entity6 started are still ongoing			1
mr @entity14 said : ' there are projected savings of at least £ 377 million so the predictions that i made this summer that we could bring this project in at under £ 9 billion has almost certainly been met			2
' @entity20 also have to conclude , and we have to sign off , the negotiations with @entity28 over the size of the amount of money that will be paid back to the public purse - so if you were to add to that £ 377 million , anything that will not be used but is held against outstanding work and anything that might come back from @entity28 , it is entirely reasonable to expect that figure to rise			1
' the @entity49 on the @entity50 will eventually be opened to the public the @entity19 's construction and transport programme came in £ 47million below the previous estimated figure some £ 103million of contingency is being held to cover the remaining risks in the programme			2
