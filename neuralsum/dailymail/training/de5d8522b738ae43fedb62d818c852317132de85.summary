@entity1 chairman @entity0 is open to the idea of a foreigner succeeding @entity4 - as long as the manager in question has a deep understanding of the @entity9 game			1
@entity0 confirmed earlier this summer that @entity4 would remain @entity11 boss until his contract expires at the end of @entity14			1
@entity0 says the @entity1 board has not considered whether they should extend @entity4 's deal beyond that tournament and the @entity11 manager claims he has given it little thought himself			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 ( right ) has refused to rule out the possibility of a foreign coach managing @entity11 @entity4 will be @entity11 manager until after @entity14 , but his future beyond that is uncertain @entity0 mentioned the possibility of a @entity26 taking over as manager of @entity11 - @entity28 ( pictured ) has been touted in the past ' my four - year plan is to stay alive , ' @entity4 quipped last week at a press conference at @entity32			1
should the @entity1 decide to opt for a change after @entity14 , which is likely given that @entity4 will be nearing his 69th birthday then , a foreign manager could be considered			1
the @entity1 was criticised for appointing @entity36 and @entity37 before @entity4 's tenure , but @entity0 is refusing to rule out going down the same road again this time around			1
' they would n't necessarily have to be @entity9 but they certainly would have to understand @entity9 football , ' @entity0 told @entity43 at an @entity1 grassroots event in @entity45			2
' you would n't rule out someone who is a @entity48 or @entity49 or @entity26 but they would have to understand @entity9 football			2
' the mention of a @entity26 from @entity0 is interesting given that @entity28 was reported to have been considered as a possible candidate for the @entity11 job in the past			1
still , @entity0 is not in a hurry to start considering who should take the post and when			2
' we have n't thought that far ahead , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity4 restored some faith to the nation 's football fans by guiding @entity11 to an impressive 2 - 0 win over @entity63 in their opening @entity14 qualifier last month			1
@entity65 ( right ) , named @entity11 captain after this summer 's @entity67 , will be eager to impress @entity4 's squad met for the first time since that victory on monday as they started preparations for this week 's qualifiers against @entity73 and @entity74			1
all 21 players , including @entity77 defender @entity76 , who has replaced the injured @entity78 , reported for duty on monday at @entity80 , where the squad is due to undertake a light training session			0
the build - up to the double - header was overshadowed by @entity4 's decision to omit @entity86 from his squad , even though the striker was in contention to play for @entity90 against @entity91 last weekend			1
the former @entity93 man , who suffered a thigh injury on international duty last month , did not play against the @entity91 and @entity4 is now hoping to move on from the matter			0
' it 's all about the fitness of a player who was injured unfortunately on @entity11 duty last time , and he has n't recovered so he is not fit to play , ' @entity4 said in an interview with @entity102			1
' if he was fit to play then i would have expected him to be with us			0
' @entity86 's absence means @entity106 will be given another chance to lead the line after his fine brace against the @entity110			0
captain @entity65 will also be eager to make an impression given that he is currently sidelined from action with @entity113 because of a three - match ban			0
@entity65 will join @entity115 as @entity11 's third highest goalscorer of all time if he finds the net on three more occasions over the next week			2
' i hope he does ( reach @entity121 ' landmark )			0
i want him to score as many goals as possible , ' said @entity124 , who is eight short of sir @entity126 's all - time record			0
' it 's not all about goals			0
it 's all about victories			0
it will be good for his confidence though			0
' despite concerns about a low turn - out , it is understood that around 50,000 fans are expected to be at thursday 's match against @entity73 - around 10,000 more than attended the september friendly against @entity141			0
@entity11 will then take on @entity74 in @entity142 on sunday			0
around 15,000 fans are expected to attend @entity11 's under - 21 play - off against @entity145 at @entity146 on friday .			2

@entity4 will remain @entity11 manager until at least after @entity14
@entity4 's future after that is uncertain , and @entity0 says that @entity11 could appoint a foreign manager to succeed him
dyke continued by saying that should a foreign manager be chosen , they would have to have a deep understanding of the @entity9 game
@entity4 joked that he had not considered his @entity11 future , and that his four - year plan was to ' stay alive '
