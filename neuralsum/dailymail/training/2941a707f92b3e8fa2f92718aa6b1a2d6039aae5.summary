internet fame is n't all it 's cracked up to be , as 16 - year - old @entity2 from small town @entity3 , @entity1 learned in the past two weeks			1
the high - schooler known across social media as ' @entity2 from @entity6 ' went from just 144 @entity8 followers to more than 730,000 after a picture of him working a shift at the store surfaced online			1
that photo generated a popular meme and now ' @entity2 from @entity6 ' is searched more on @entity15 than pop sensation @entity16			1
like any teenager , @entity2 is enjoying the newfound attention but admits it also has its downfalls			1
he 's bombarded like a celebrity anytime he goes out of his house , which has left his parents frightened for his safety at school and work			2
they say he 's even received death threats			0
he is now known simple as ' @entity34 from @entity6 ' @entity2 was working a shift at his local @entity36 on november when fame hit him out of nowhere			1
' it was just a normal day , ' @entity2 told the @entity39 in his second interview , after appearing on the @entity41 last week			1
somehow a picture of him scanning and bagging items at his cash register surfaced online , and a teenage girl in @entity46 posted it on her @entity8 account with the caption ' @entity49			1
' the picture quickly went viral , generating the hastag # alexfromtarget , and suddenly his sunday shift got a whole lot busier			2

@entity2 's picture allegedly first surfaced on @entity68 , but went viral worldwide when a teen in @entity46 posted this pic to her @entity8			1
@entity2 says he first started noticing something was up during a shift at @entity6 , when his line got unusually long and girls started approaching him to take pictures by the time he clocked out that evening , @entity2 turned on his phone and was greeted with a slough of text messages from friends about his internet celebrity			1
at that point he had amassed a fandom of 100,000 followers on @entity8			0
confused , he tweeted ' am i famous now ? ' while @entity2 has adjusted to the internet fame well , and is more than happy to pose for selfies with locals in his town , the attention can be overwhelming sometimes			1

he 's also had his life threatened , and his girlfriend @entity105 has become the target of jealous comments			0
@entity2 's only tv appearance was on the @entity41 last week			1
he says he has received death threats since the photo went viral ' @entity2 from target , i 'll find you and i will kill you , ' one private message read			1
