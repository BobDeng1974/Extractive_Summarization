a @entity2 firm has produced the first ' petrol from air ' , it emerged today - in a pioneering scientific breakthrough that could end mankind 's reliance on declining fossil fuels			2
@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , claims to have made five litres of petrol since august using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour			1
experts have hailed the incredible breakthrough as a potential ' game - changer ' in the battle against climate change and solution to the globe 's escalating energy crisis			1
last year , @entity2 researchers claimed that they had also found the ' holy grail ' of the green economy by producing petrol from air for the first time			0
@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , made petrol using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour while the company is still developing their process and still need to take electricity from the national grid , it believes it will eventually be possible to power the synthesis entirely from renewable sources			1
within two years it hopes to build a commercial - scale plant capable of making a ton of petrol a day and expand into producing green aviation fuel to make airline travel more eco-friendly			1
the technology involves mixing air with sodium hydroxide , then electrolysing the resultant sodium carbonate to release pure carbon dioxide			1
this is then reacted with hydrogen electrolysed from water to make a hydrocarbon mixture , with the reaction conditions varied depending on the type of fuel desired			0
the fuel that is produced can be made ready for use in any petrol tank with the addition of the same additives currently added to fuel			0
alternatively it can be blended directly with gasoline , diesel and aviation fuel			0
development stage : the company claims to have made five litres of petrol over the past few months , but they hope to move to a commercial - scale plant producing a ton a day within two years this diagram illustrates the pioneering process for creating petrol from water @entity80 , the company 's chief executive , revealed the breakthrough at a conference at the @entity84 in @entity85 this week			1
' we are converting renewable electricity into a more versatile , usable and storable form of energy , namely liquid transport fuels , ' he told the @entity91			0
@entity9 is blown into a tower filled with a mist of sodium hydroxide solution			0
the carbon dioxide in the air reacts with some of the sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate			2
this sodium carbonate is then electrolysed to release the carbon dioxide , which is collected and stored			2
a dehumidifier condenses water out of the same air passed into the tower , with this condensed water then passed into an electrolyser where it is split into hydrogen and oxygen			0
the carbon dioxide and hydrogren are reacted together to make a hydrocarbon mixture , with reaction conditions varied depending on the kind of fuel required			1
the product can then be mixed with the same additives used in current fuels to ease starting , burn cleanly and avoid corrosion problems			0
otherwise it can be blended directly with gasoline , diesel and aviation fuel			0
' we think that by the end of 2014 , provided we can get the funding going , we can be producing petrol using renewable energy and doing it on a commercial basis			0
' extracting carbon dioxide from air - effectively removing the principal industrial greenhouse gas from the atmosphere - has been described as the ' holy grail ' of the emerging green economy			1
however , recycling that extracted carbon dioxide into fuel usable in existing engines has the potential to transform the world 's environmental and economic landscape			1
mr @entity80 said he planned to be producing petrol on a commercial basis using renewable energy by the end of 2014			0
within the next 15 years the company is aiming for a refinery - scale operation , he said			1
he added : ' you have the potential to change the economics of a country if you can make your own fuel			2
' @entity9 already has the backing of the @entity84			2
@entity155 , the @entity84 's head of energy and the environment , said : ' it sounds too good to be true , but it is true			0
' mr @entity155 said @entity9 's small pilot plant , which he had visited , used well - known principles with the innovation being that they have made it happen as a process			2
' it uses well - known and well - established components but what is exciting is that they have put the whole thing together and shown that it can work , ' he added			0
while the company claims to have used carbon dioxide extracted directly from the air in their reaction , it is mainly using industrial sources of the gas until it is able to improve the performance of ' carbon capture			1
' as yet the process is considered too expensive to be commercially viable , with the extraction of one ton of carbon dioxide costing as much as Â£ 400 .			1

@entity84 hails the process as a potential ' game changer ' in battle against climate change
@entity10 - based @entity9 claims they can make petrol directly from water and carbon dioxide in the air
within two years the company hopes to have a commercial - scale plant capable of producing up to a ton of fuel a day
