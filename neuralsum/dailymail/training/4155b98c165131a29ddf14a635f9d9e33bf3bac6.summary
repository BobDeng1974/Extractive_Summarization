his lifetime ’s ambition was to remove @entity3 from the @entity4 and , in that endeavour , history will reflect that he failed			1
not now , not at any time in the future , will @entity8 lead his native land to the political status that he calls freedom			1
the 59 - year - old first minister of @entity3 knew there would come but one chance to fulfil his dream of independence and the determination and guile with which he set about the task was , at times , awe inspiring			1
he bet his career on @entity3 independence for unionists – those people who mr @entity8 now knows still make up the majority of @entity3 – his efforts were terrifying too			1
nobody but @entity8 could have led @entity3 to the brink of divorce from the rest of the @entity4			1
in truth , it is highly unlikely that anyone but this man could have led the @entity42 into government , far less carve open the @entity45 defence and set up a clear shot on goal			1
but , in doing so , he laid his leadership of the nation and his party on the line			1
if he did not score , he could not continue			1
married to the reclusive @entity52 – 17 years his senior – childless and completely obsessive about politics , mr @entity8 is a man with few hobbies			1
but betting on the horses was one			1
here was the biggest gamble of his life			1
had the masterplan to break up the 307 - year - old union succeeded , it could have been @entity62 announcing his departure from @entity64 yesterday			1
many of those who watched the premier ’s highly emotional plea for a no vote earlier this week had the clear sense that , if @entity3 left , the mr @entity62 was gone too			1
the referendum mr @entity8 fought for , and to which mr @entity62 agreed , was a career - ending shoot - out			1
and , in mr @entity8 ’s case , it was the final stop in a 40 - year journey			2
the joker and the husband : in a @entity79 fashion show ( left ) and with his elusive wife @entity52 ( right ) it concluded not , as he had wished , with the promised land , a confident , assured @entity3 entirely in control of its own destiny			2
it concluded , as perhaps he should have known it would , with his country renewing its historic bonds with its @entity4 ‘ family ’			2
should the @entity94 - born civil servant ’s son have sensed as much when he attended @entity95 during a time when @entity3 nationalism was little more than a fringe movement ? he was as @entity104 as his father @entity99 in those days – until he had a row with his girlfriend , a pretty @entity102 girl called @entity103			2
their ideological clash ended with her screaming : ‘ if you feel like that , go and join the bloody @entity3 nationalists ’			2
their faces tell the story			2
clad in tartan and bearing flags , they were hoping for triumph – but ended up in tears			2
after @entity8 ’s bid for independence was defeated , the sense of disappointment was felt keenly in @entity124 and @entity125			1
‘ my feeling was just crushing , quite devastating , ’ said first - time voter @entity126 , 16 , watching the count in the capital wearing a school uniform covered in @entity131 badges			2
‘ i genuinely thought the feeling on the ground was different			1
’ near @entity137 , tearful tartan - wearing activists gathered , surrounded by @entity131 slogans			2
the party – meant to be a celebration of a new dawn - was definitely over			2
the following day the teenage student in economics and medieval history found himself in the @entity146 offices of the @entity42			2
little would they imagine the constitutional ramifications of his conversion to their cause			2
in time , this cocky young man ’s political powers would relegate the @entity154 to also - rans in @entity3 politics			1
and , in a few more years , the decades - long dominance of the @entity157 north of the border would be smashed			2
it was not merely through charm and persuasion – though mr @entity8 possesses both – that these were achieved			1
last week , nationalist grandee @entity163 stood shoulder to shoulder with mr @entity8 on the campaign frontline			0
but , in less politically optimistic times , mr @entity163 had opposed his successful 1990 bid to lead the party			0
‘ after seeing him in operation as deputy leader , ’ he said , ‘ i knew that his penchant for disliking and denigrating those who disagreed with him would turn the @entity42 into a nest of vipers , poisoning its bloodstream			1
‘ i was not wrong			0
among @entity8 ’s most vociferous supporters ten years ago you will find today his most vociferous opponents , all of them wounded when they would not toe the leader ’s line , all discarded when they showed they had a mind of their own			0
you can always judge men by those they gather around them			0
@entity188 men attract big men			0
little men gather cronies , smaller than themselves			0
’ those remarks came in 2000 when mr @entity8 had just resigned after a decade as leader			0
mr @entity163 did not reckon on the @entity8 comeback four years later			0
he could not have dreamed the party colleague he cared little for would be by some distance the biggest political beast in the land – a figure so focused on his goal that some of the shrewdest strategists in the @entity4 despaired of finding a way to stop him			0
mr @entity8 ’s colleague , education secretary @entity205 , once described the experience of walking down the street with his party leader			0
it was , he said , like watching a ‘ crusade to personally convert every @entity3 voter ’			0
others pointed to his bullying , domineering nature			0
it was even hinted at – unfairly perhaps – that the notorious cybernats and the @entity131 campaign ’s over-aggressive campaigners were formed in the image of their party leader			0
ever ready to play the ‘ bully ’ card against @entity45 , mr @entity8 had little compunction about throwing his own weight around			1
he was the master of the skilfully worded put down , a politician who rarely seemed happier than when the joke was on his opponent			0
ultimately , the smugness began to jar			0
too fond , said commentators , of playing the man rather the ball			0
despite the failure , the scale of what @entity8 has achieved in @entity3 politics is immense and yet the scale of what @entity8 has achieved in @entity3 politics is immense			1
it was during his first spell of leadership that he campaigned alongside the @entity242 and the @entity243 for devolution			0
it came in the form of a @entity247 with powers over major areas of policy such as health , education , justice and local government			1
lord @entity255 famously said at the time the new constitutional arrangement would ‘ kill nationalism stone dead ’			0
mr @entity8 reasoned more astutely that it would breathe new life into the movement – that , ultimately , devolution would become the highway to @entity3 independence			1
even now , in failure , the leader of the @entity42 has wrested a raft of new powers for @entity3 from @entity45			1
@entity8 may have said that independence referendums are ‘ once in a generation events ’ but his party ’s next bid for independence could come sooner than many imagine			1
what now for the man whose last attempt to take a back seat and spend more time with @entity52 in @entity277 resulted in a slump in his party ’s fortunes ? mr @entity8 contends that his wife had the veto on his standing for the leadership of the party in 2004			0
had she used it , few believe the @entity4 would have stood on the brink of being broken apart this week			0
as one fellow member of the @entity247 observed : ‘ without politics , @entity8 would have nothing			0
‘ he exists only for politics			0
’ if @entity3 does one day cut its ties with the rest of the @entity4 , there is little doubt that @entity8 will be credited with laying the groundwork			0
but that is not the goal he set himself			0
he is not a man who will take defeat easily .			0

aged 59 , first minister has achieved more than many thought he could
he staked his entire career on independence , a bet he knew he had lost
but even in failure , he has wrested several new powers from @entity45
