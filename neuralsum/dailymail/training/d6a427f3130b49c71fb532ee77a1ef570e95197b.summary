tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly in hospital every year from kidney failure linked to dehydration , @entity1 officials have revealed			1
they calculate that up to 42,000 deaths a year would be avoided if staff ensured patients had enough to drink and carried out simple tests			1
@entity11 , the @entity1 watchdog , is today issuing guidelines to staff to help them prevent deaths from the condition – known as acute kidney injury – which is common in the elderly and patients with heart disease , diabetes and blood infections			1
@entity24 said she had to smuggle ice lollies in to hospital after nurses left her mother @entity28 so thirsty her lips cracked and bled mrs @entity28 was admitted to @entity30 in april last year suffering with inoperable lung cancer and secondary liver cancer it is estimated that a fifth of all patients attending @entity36 every year – one million people – suffer from the illness , of whom an estimated 210,000 die			1
tens of thousands of these deaths are due to dehydration and are avoidable with better care , with one kidney expert accusing doctors and nurses of ‘ taking their eye off the ball ’			1
the latest estimate is far higher than any previous figure			0
in 2009 , a @entity52 report said the number dying in hospitals because of dehydration was just 900 a year			1
the family of @entity28 , 79 , have told how they smuggled ice lollies in to @entity30 after nurses left her so thirsty her lips cracked and bled			0
mrs @entity28 was ‘ treated like an animal ’ by nurses , who claimed they could not help when her family begged them to act as she became increasingly dehydrated			0
while she was too weak to drink from a cup , her thirst could have been quenched with oral sponges			0
but staff did not provide these , leaving her family to feed her ice lollies they bought outside			2
mrs @entity28 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity24 ) was initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia when she was admitted to @entity30 before @entity71 revealed she had inoperable lung cancer as they finally received a formal apology from the hospital , mrs @entity28 ’s family yesterday spoke of their ongoing distress about the way she was left to die with so little dignity			2
her daughter @entity24 , 51 , who lived close to her mother and father @entity82 , 80 , in @entity83 , @entity84 , said medical staff deprived her dying mother of ‘ basic human dignity ’ in her final days			1
‘ my mother was left dehydrated , with no monitoring of her fluid or food intake , ’ she added			0
‘ we constantly found her freezing cold , with cracked bleeding lips and in considerable distress due to her discomfort and desperate thirst			0
we even took to bringing her ice lollies because the hospital was unable to provide oral sponges			2
we fear that if we had not been there then mum would have received nothing at all			0
’ she said the care received by her mother was ‘ appalling ’ and ‘ no better than that given to a helpless animal ’			0
after three days of persistent complaints , nurses finally began using wet sponges on mrs @entity28 ’s lips			0
the trust ’s chief nursing officer @entity109 has written to mrs @entity24 , offering a ‘ heartfelt and sincere ’ apology			0
she added : ‘ we have taken action to improve care			0
’ mrs @entity28 ( pictured with her husband , @entity82 , in 1983 ) was left freezing cold , dehydrated and in great discomfort by staff at the hospital			1
her family say that her lips cracked because they were so dry the new guidelines come amid growing concern about the standard of @entity1 care , with several damning reports highlighting appalling neglect in some hospitals			1
@entity11 says the condition can not be blamed on poor nursing , because it often develops before patients are admitted to hospital , but experts say @entity1 staff are not doing enough to detect the illness and prevent it from getting worse			1
professor @entity134 , a former national director of @entity135 who works at @entity137 in @entity138 , said : ‘ it ’s the vulnerable , frail elderly who are affected			0
it is estimated that a fifth of all patients attending @entity36 every year - one million people - suffer from acute kidney injury , of whom an estimated 210,000 die ( file picture ) ‘ they do n’t get adequate fluids – they do n’t feel like drinking , so they do n’t request them			1
‘ the doctors and nurses think about the fall , the pneumonia or whatever else is affecting them and take their eye off the ball in terms of the kidneys			0
‘ by the time it ’s noticed , it ’s often very late in the day and too late			0
’ acute kidney injury describes the sudden shut - down of the kidneys			0
if detected early enough , the condition can be treated by giving patients extra fluids or putting them on a dialysis machine			1
the condition can also be caused by @entity168 ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) painkillers and ace inhibitor drugs , and doctors are urged to stop prescribing these immediately if patients are affected			2
it is rarely recorded on death certificates , because doctors do n’t realise patients are suffering from it			0
dr @entity179 , a kidney specialist at the @entity182 @entity1 trust in @entity183 who helped draw up the guidelines , said acute kidney injury killed more people than any of the common cancers			1
he added : ‘ in the past , the care for this condition has not always been uniformly good , partly because the patients have tended to present to a range of non-specialists who may have been unfamiliar with the best prevention and treatment of the condition			2
‘ many hospitals and healthcare professionals have been doing an excellent job in watching out for acute kidney injury in their patients , but unfortunately this good practice is not seen everywhere			2
not only can we save lives with this guideline but the money we save could be put back into general @entity1 care			2
’ the guidelines tell doctors and staff to carry out simple checks to detect the condition in patients over 65 , particularly those with dementia or other conditions whereby they are dependent on someone else to give them water			1
other high - risk groups include those with heart failure , liver disease , diabetes or blood infections			0
@entity11 says the condition can not be blamed on poor nursing , but experts say @entity1 staff are not doing enough to detect the illness and prevent it from getting worse ( file picture ) doctors and nurses are urged to carry out simple urine tests to measure the levels of the chemical serum creatine , which are high if patients have kidney failure			1
staff are also told to ensure patients have enough fluids and to check whether patients are dehydrated by looking for signs such as dry skin and sunken eyes			2
' many hospitals and healthcare professionals have been doing an excellent job in watching out for acute kidney injury in their patients , but unfortunately this good practice is not seen everywhere ' - dr @entity179 dr @entity251 , general secretary of the @entity252 , said : ‘ this guidance should help doctors and nurses to spot those patients who are at risk and be confident in monitoring and treating them			2
‘ this is an area of medicine where many lives could be saved if the level of understanding is the same among staff in all settings , and the @entity1 as a whole should act on this guidance as a matter of urgency			1
’ the guidance makes no mention of the @entity270 whereby fluid , food and other drugs are withdrawn from patients who are believed to be close to death			0
but as the condition is primarily caused by dehydration , it could affect some patients on the pathway .			1
