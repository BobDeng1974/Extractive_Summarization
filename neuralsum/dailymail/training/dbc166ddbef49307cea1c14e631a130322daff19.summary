by @entity0 @entity2 ’s gripping study of secret writing in its hidden or invisible form is chiefly a history of espionage techniques , or what @entity7 used to call tradecraft			1
though , as @entity2 says , ‘ invisible ink conjures up images of childhood magic and fun ’ — a world of wonder encompassing card tricks , numerology and rabbits appearing from hats — the subject of sleight - of - hand actually impinges on notions of death and danger , privacy , freedom , and the cancer of state surveillance			1
@entity2 has spent her career in the archives , sifting through declassified documents , familiarising herself with chemicals and abstruse formulae — and the history of invisible inks and surreptitious communication is a long one			1
master spy : @entity37 as the famous @entity38 the story begins in @entity41 and @entity42 , when messages were hidden in the belly of a hare , the incision sewn up , and then the creature handed to a trusted servant in a hunting net			1
two thousand years later , the gambit was still in force			2
the @entity51 used freeze - dried rats as concealment devices			1
@entity55 generals sent messages to their commanders by scrawling with the juice of medicinal herbs or ‘ the milky substance from wild figs ’			1
the parchment was allowed to dry			2
when later it was sprinkled with ashes , the letters became visible			2
another useful ink was urine , which became readable when covered with dust			1
messages could also be scratched on wax - coated tablets , or on rolled - up beaten lead worn as earrings			1
sheets of papyrus were inserted into bridles or breastplates			2
@entity77 sent messages hidden in dog collars or engraved them on toenails , which were revealed with powdered charcoal			1
in @entity83 , the emperor wrote on silk , rolled it in a ball , covered the pellet with wax , called for the messenger and placed it in his rectum			2
the chaps at @entity93 do n’t know they are born			2
in a more credulous age , invisible writing was seen as a branch of the necromantic arts			1
because he recommended trapping a dormouse and extracting its juices to use as invisible ink , in 1558 @entity102 was examined by the @entity103			1
it looked like the work of the @entity106 , a text appearing when the paper was heated — made ‘ visible through fire ’			2
rodent mail : the @entity51 used freeze - dried rats as concealment devices @entity115 , using tricks perfected in the monasteries , was a particular age of secrecy and intrigue , and @entity119 ’s network of agents and informants was always finding evidence of @entity124 plots concealed in wine bottles or wedged in embroidered slippers			1
‘ secret letters were placed in a waterproof box and stuffed through the bunghole of a beer barrel			1
’ the supporters of @entity132 plotted a rebellion against the throne — and @entity135 ( @entity136 in the @entity138 film @entity139 ) found messages scratched with pickling juice inscribed between the lines of bibles and prayer books			1
the corner of pages would be snipped as a signal that something was written on it			0
the material was intercepted and the conspirators tortured on the rack , hanged , drawn and quartered			0
crafty : @entity136 as @entity153 secret agent @entity119 @entity119 also craftily forged letters , asking for the names and addresses of confederates — men who were also then disembowelled and hanged			1
@entity132 herself was beheaded in 1587			0
less dramatically , invisible ink has been used to decorate fire - screens			1
impregnated with cobalt chloride , the panels would depict images as they warmed up			1
scientists such as @entity167 , using a mixture of sulphur and ammonium chloride , in the 1670s wrote notes and calculations invisibly in exercise - books — to prevent a theft of their ideas			1
owing to the smell , the gullible again suspected ‘ occult processes			0
’ but it was always during wars that this branch of cryptography — of codes and ciphers — was most prized			0
by 1915 , @entity185 was monitoring the mail of 13,524 citizens , opening the post sent to foreign addresses			0
by these means @entity191 double - agents were discovered , who were using lemon juice to tell the enemy about @entity197 troop movements			1
@entity198 found blotting paper , nibs and lemons in the accused ’s lodgings			0
the fresh , juicy lemon was prime evidence at the trial , and the spies were shot at the @entity207			0
@entity77 were found to hide their inks — generally slightly more sophisticated than lemons — in medicine bottles , soap , toothpaste , chewing gum , and pomade			0
it was even soaked into pairs of socks			0
agents during the @entity220 were issued with special pens and pads			0
detection and concealment grew ever more ingenious , with ultraviolet and infrared photography to reveal messages , ferrous oxides with which to sponge the paper , and microscopic analysis of documents to trace alien particles or the indentation of fibres			1
@entity77 were found to hide their invisible inks in medicine bottles , soap , toothpaste , chewing gum , and pomade			2
it was even soaked into pairs of socks ‘ every contact leaves a trace , ’ says @entity2 , sounding like @entity243			0
the biggest new development was the invention of the microdot by @entity249 in 1925 , which meant files could be reduced to the size of postage stamps or full - stops on typed letters			2
during @entity257 , the @entity256 arrested saboteurs who were using microdots to collaborate with the @entity261 ’ quest for information about atomic energy , and who were also sending @entity266 reports about the extent of the destruction of @entity256 oil stores at @entity270			0
the spies went to the electric chair			0
with cyberspace and the internet , today we have come a long way from lemons — though human deviousness is the same			0
the contemporary equivalent of @entity135 is a ‘ computer forensic investigator ’			0
cyber spying : @entity282 , founded by @entity283 ( pictured ) , apparently exchange hidden messages in pornography apparently , @entity282 exchange hidden messages in the pixels of digital pornographic movies			1
so that ’s what they are doing all day in @entity293 at @entity294 , watching @entity295 over and over			0
but a good job they are — as concealed in the binary codes of one film ’s text files were plans about seizing hostages on a passenger ship			0
images on @entity306 auction sites are also terrorist hiding places			1
were i an evil mastermind i ’d utilise tapes of @entity312 ’s @entity311 — who ’d think to look there ? the @entity315 and the @entity317 police routinely opened the mail , tapped phones and monitored and mistrusted their own citizens			0
the @entity322 had automated equipment to slit open envelopes , copy and re-seal the post			0
@entity2 is correct to argue the secret services in @entity328 democracies have always envied the enemy ’s brutality in this regard — and since 9/11 they have been granted and now enjoy totalitarian powers ‘ to read everyone ’s email with one keystroke ’			2
we ca n’t go out of the door without being on some government cctv camera			0
it is as if the @entity103 is back , and ‘ the hidden is exposed			2
’ and all future thoughts of ( or rights to ) a private life are obliterated			0
@entity346 has been born .			0
