you can tell @entity1 are on the brink of being very special again			1
how ? easy - people have started clutching at straws just lately , desperate to criticise @entity6 ’s side			1
after @entity9 was sent off against @entity10 earlier this season a @entity8 rumour started that the @entity1 and @entity12 captain had got himself red carded deliberately because he had a private plane waiting , and he needed to depart early for some sort of celebrity social event that evening			1
another rumour started that @entity9 had fallen out with @entity17 , and that ’s why they were n’t playing well together for @entity1			2
@entity9 lashed out at @entity20 at @entity21 to earn himself an early bath @entity9 was shown the a red card for kicking out at @entity20 but @entity1 held on to beat @entity10 2 - 1 rumours that @entity9 and @entity17 ( centre ) had fallen out were quickly dispelled well i was at @entity21 that day when @entity1 beat the @entity10 2 - 1 , and at around 6pm , long after the final whistle , both @entity9 and @entity17 were suited up , on the pitch , playing football with their children and seemingly having a great time together			1
so that killed both of those nonsense rumours at once			0
it ’s interesting that people seem desperate to criticise and bring down @entity1			2
another example : i ’m forever being told that @entity38 was a bad signing			0
if @entity1 had paid £ 50m for him and given him a six - year contract then the critics might have a point			1
but his injury record is n’t great so that ’s why @entity1 only signed him on loan ; a shrewd move			2
despite not arriving at the club until the @entity52 was over , and despite an injury list that would leave @entity54 in pieces , @entity50 put together a team that faltered for the first couple of months of the season , but entertained us royally in flashes			0
@entity38 has played a bit - part role since joining @entity1 on loan from @entity63 this summer @entity38 has struggled with injury and sat out the @entity66 derby last month which @entity1 lost 1 - 0 it was never going to be smooth			1
think about the wreckage of last season			0
backroom staff decimated , morale low , players left , others struggled for confidence and form , and @entity1 were awful to watch			2
i always speak to fans when i go to games up and down the country , and the general consensus at @entity1 is that this season , despite a few poor results , the football under @entity6 is a significant improvement from last season , and the fans are happy with that			1
there are two results that @entity1 ’s critics seem to be living off – the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity90 and the 4 - 0 reverse at @entity92			1
@entity1 were brilliant at @entity90 until an inexplicable decision from @entity94 gave @entity90 a penalty and @entity1 crumbled			1
but people read way too much into that game ; they even said it showed @entity90 will be fine in the @entity99 this season			2
as i write this they are bottom and have n’t won a game since they beat @entity1			2
the problems @entity1 suffered that day are easily rectified , but critics were too quick to forget how spectacular the football was that took them into a 3 - 1 lead			1
@entity1 slumped to defeat against @entity92 in the @entity108 with an experimental side @entity6 used the @entity92 defeat to analyse his side and subsequently , three senior players left @entity113 turns away to celebrate after putting @entity90 4 - 3 up against @entity1 earlier in the season but until they collapsed , @entity1 played well against @entity90 with @entity115 scoring this stunner as for the defeat in @entity118 , of the five senior players who started that game , three have left ( @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 ) and @entity124 has n’t started a game since			1
it was a game @entity6 used to find out more about some of his senior professionals			2
he probably was n’t expecting such a beating , but the @entity108 was n’t high on his priority list this season			0
so @entity1 now find themselves in the top four despite so many people saying they have wasted a load of money and are poor			2
the worrying thing for the @entity1 haters is that they keep improving			0
i ’m sure there will be dips and they will come unstuck in some matches but just take a look at the last two games			0
@entity50 totally out - coached @entity143 with a game plan that earned three points at @entity146 , and then destroyed inferior opposition with some breathtaking football against @entity149			0
@entity9 and @entity115 are in brilliant form ; @entity152 ’s control and passing are being trusted again ; @entity154 is currently the best keeper in the @entity99			0
@entity1 look to have turned the corner and were impressive in their narrow victory over @entity146 @entity9 was on target on saturday as @entity1 strolled to victory over @entity149 at @entity21 with even more improvement , and maybe more signings to come in january , the @entity99 has a lot to fear from @entity1			1
@entity50 is a man who looks you in the eye when he talks to you and answers your questions			0
his press conferences are informative and entertaining – he speaks to the fans through the media , which is exactly what should happen			0
and i even like the way he approached his criticism of the festive schedule in @entity12			0
he said it is n’t good for players who have families , but then added : ‘ i have to adapt , and i shall adapt			0
’ as much as the united - haters loved last season , they are beginning to dislike this campaign , with @entity1 showing signs they are on their way back			1
they are a joy to watch at times , and if they can get the injury list down and add consistency to their undoubted quality , @entity50 may be on the brink of producing something extra special at @entity21			1
this manager is even making @entity192 look good , so anything is possible			0
even @entity192 , who has had his struggles at @entity1 , has improved under the guidance of @entity50			0

@entity1 **'s** critics have been out in force this season
but they are living off two results - defeats to @entity90 and @entity92
@entity1 **'s** start was never going to be smooth after the troubles last season
@entity6 may be on the brink of something special at @entity21
