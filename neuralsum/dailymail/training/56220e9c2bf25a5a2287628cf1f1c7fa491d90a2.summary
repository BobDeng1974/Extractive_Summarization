a @entity1 company has partnered with @entity3 researchers in the hope of producing human kidneys on 3d printers			1
last year the research team at the @entity8 , led by professor @entity9 , were able to grow a tiny kidney , just two millimetres long , in a laboratory dish			1
the @entity13 based bio-printing company , @entity12 have signed an agreement with the @entity8 's company @entity15 to see how far they might be able to push the research , in the hope that eventually they will be able to bio-print kidneys			1
researchers in @entity3 have been able to grow a two millimetre long kidney in lab conditions ( @entity22 : file photo )			2
it is hoped this research might lead to 3d printing of kidneys ( a 3d printer is pictured right ) @entity29 , the 3d printing of body parts , has been occurring for years			2
there has been success in printing skin , blood vessel , the cartilage of the ear , and some success with more complex parts such as the bladder and uterus			0
bio-printing kidneys could increase the number of organs available for people needing transplants and greatly improve the chances of transplant success			0
professor @entity9 leads the research team at the @entity8 who have signed an agreement with bio-printing company @entity12 however , the dream of bio-printing a kidney is still 15 to 20 years away , estimates professor @entity9 because the kidney is such a complex organ			1
' bio-engineering a kidney is probably the most difficult thing you could try and build , ' she said			2
' the kidney is a large organ with 35 different cell types that all have different functions , and a whole lot of little tubules that have to be lined up the right way , making it a much more complex organ than the liver , the pancreas or the heart			0
' @entity72 's ultimate goal might be to print a kidney , but their initial goal is to reproduce tiny kidneys in laboratory settings , as professor @entity9 's team have already done , which can be used for drugs testing			1
they might help test cures for renal diseases caused by genetic conditions and also speed up the process of producing pharmaceuticals			0
' most drugs that are developed fail , because they are harmful either to the heart or to the kidney			0
so if you could find out very early that the drugs you 're producing would hurt the kidney you would n't waste your time developing it , ' said professor @entity9			1
it is hoped that eventually 3d printers , such as this one producing a likeness of @entity96 , might be able to make organs			0

researchers from the @entity8 grew a tiny kidney in a dish
@entity1 bio-printing company have signed a deal with the researchers to develop the kidneys for drugs testing and *potential* 3d printing
the kidney is ' the hardest thing to try and build ' , said professor @entity9
