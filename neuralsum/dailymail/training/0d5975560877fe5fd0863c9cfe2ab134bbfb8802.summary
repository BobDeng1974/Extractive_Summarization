for most of us , a slender waist is the product of a careful diet and plenty of exercise			0
but not for @entity6 , 24			1
the @entity7 has shrunk her waist from 25in ( 64cm ) to just 16in ( 40cm ) by wearing a corset every day for three years - even while sleeping			2
and despite now having a waist smaller than most catwalk models , the @entity11 slimmer says she hopes to whittle her waist down to a shocking 14inches ( 38cm )			1
it feels nice and smooth			0
' but @entity6 's tiny waist could prove to have serious consequences for her health , and already , she struggles to stand up without her corset , thanks to wasted muscles in her back and stomach			1
her stomach is so constricted , she ca n't eat a normal meal and instead eats up to 10 small meals a day			0
not that she 's concerned : ' my life has n't changed , just slowed down a little , ' she reveals			0
' now my movement is more feminine			0
' right now i 'm a little breathless , changing corsets is like a high - performance sport for me ' tiny though @entity6 's waist is , the record for the world 's tiniest midriff is held by another - @entity45 @entity44 , whose waist measures just under 15in ( 38cm )			1
by comparison , the average @entity48 woman has a waist that measures 33.43in ( 84.9cm ) - equivalent to a dress size 14			2
however , doctors say that a waist bigger than 31.49in ( 80cm ) could lead to serious problems , including heart disease			2
recent figures show that nearly 57 per cent of @entity48 women have waists bigger than the healthy limit set by experts			0
but tests reveal that @entity6 's tiny waist is also causing problems , among them digestive troubles as her stomach is forced out of its natural postiion			1
according to dr @entity69 , specialist in internal medicine , the corset has also resulted in @entity6 having weaker lungs than is normal for a woman her age			0
' in time , it wo n't be possible to move without the corset , or in the worst case , it wo n't be possible to move in general , ' he warns			0
although @entity6 's tiny waist is guaranteed to raise a few eyebrows , not least that of her doctor , the @entity11 believes she has the perfect feminine figure			1
@entity80 skinny : @entity6 is now trying to break the adult world record of 15in @entity83 weensy torso : @entity6 believes she has a great figure , but it 's come at great cost to her health @entity6 says , ' some people find my shape really attractive '			1

@entity6 , 24 , has a 16in waist but wants a smaller one
her tiny waist has already caused her breathing and digestive problems
doctor warns that eventually , she may not be able to stand *unsupported*
