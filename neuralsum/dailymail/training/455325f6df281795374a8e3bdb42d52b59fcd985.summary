the older girl 's face - which showed red ochre markings - was creased from the place it rested on her shawl a 500 - year - old frozen @entity7 mummy known as ' @entity8 ' was suffering from a bacterial infection when she died - and being able to ' diagnose ' the disease could lead to new insights into diseases of the past			1
the discovery could help defend against new illnesses - or the re-emergence of diseases of the past			1
the mummy was suffering from an illness similar to tuberculosis when she was sacrificed on the @entity23 volcano @entity24 , 22,100 feet above sea level			1
the find - using a new technique of swabbing the lips and comparing the swabs with those of current patients - is the first time a disease has been ' diagnosed ' in such an ancient body			1
‘ @entity35 in ancient tissues is n't new , but until now it 's been impossible to say whether the infectious agent was latent or active , ’ says @entity34			2
‘ our technique opens a new door to solving some of history 's biggest mysteries , such as the reasons why the flu of 1918 was so devastating			1
it will also enhance our understanding of our future 's greatest threats , such as the emergence of new infectious agents or re-emergence of known infectious diseases			1
’ the analysis was possible because of the incredible preservation of the mummy , which is so well - preserved there were still lice in her hair			1
the team swabbed the lips of two @entity63 mummies , buried at 22,000 - feet elevation and originally discovered in 1999 , and compared the proteins they found to large databases of the human genome			2
the view from the summit of @entity24 volcano where the children were found			2
the children were plucked from these slopes in 1999 by a team who battled for three days through driving blizzards and 70mph winds to reach the summit child sacrifice was called capacocha			0
the process of capacocha could begin years before the selected person was killed			0
a mummified body of a child who was killed during one such sacrifice is pictured here along with the remains of two younger children , the teenager was plucked from the slopes of a cloudswept volcano in 1999 by a team who battled for three days through driving blizzards and 70mph winds to reach the summit 22,000ft above sea level			1
there , the archaeologists spotted a rectangular walled area , dug down through five feet of rocks and soil and finally uncovered an @entity7 burial platform			0
one of the team was lowered headfirst into the icy pit , his colleagues hanging onto his ankles , so that he could scrape away the soil and pull the dead children out with his hands			0
the three children of @entity24 , as the mummies came to be known after the mountain on which they met their death , were found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold , silver and shell statues , textiles , pots containing food and even an extravagant headdress made from the white feathers of an unidentified bird			0
but it was the state of the bodies , preserved not by embalming , like @entity129 mummies , but simply by the natural deep - freeze in which they were abandoned , that scientists found most remarkable			2
they found that the protein profile from the mummy of a 15 - year old girl , called ‘ @entity8 , ’ was similar to that of chronic respiratory infection patients , and the analysis of the @entity140 showed the presence of probably pathogenic bacteria in the genus @entity143 , responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and tuberculosis			1
in addition , x-rays of the lungs of the @entity8 showed signs of lung infection at the time of death			1
the mummies were found in 1999			0
‘ the doctors have been shaking their heads and saying they sure do n't look 500 years old but as if they 'd died a few weeks ago , ’ said @entity156 archaeologist and expedition member @entity154 at the time			1
‘ and a chill went down my spine the first time i saw her hands because they look like those of a person who is alive			2
’ it 's thought that the children were chosen by the @entity7 for their beauty and sacrificed in a ceremony called a capacocha			0
‘ the @entity7 did n't do this very often , ’ according to @entity154			0
‘ the sacrifices were children because they were considered to be the most pure			0
’ they were not sacrificed to feed or appease the gods but , rather , ‘ to enter the realm of the gods and live in paradise with them			0
it was considered a great honour , a transition to a better life from which they would be expected to remain in contact with the community through shamans ( holy men ) ’			0
the place of sacrifice : the burial site of the three children on top of @entity191 ritual killings were common within the @entity7 culture			0
in 1999 three children of @entity24 , who found deep frozen were found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold , silver and shell statues , textiles and pots containing food the children included a 13 - year - old known as the ' @entity203 ' the @entity7 believed that by scaling the snow - topped heights of the mountains they could get closer to the heavens and communicate better with the gods			1
detecting diseases in ancient remains is often fraught with difficulty , especially because of contamination			2
techniques based on microbe dna can easily be confused by environmental contamination , and they can only confirm that the pathogen was present , not that the person was infected , but the researchers behind the study , led by @entity34 of the @entity221 , @entity218 , found a way around this problem			0
they used proteomics , focusing on protein rather than @entity140 remains , to profile immune system response from degraded samples taken from 500 year - old mummies			1
proteomics , dna , and x-rays from another mummy found together with the @entity8 did not show signs of respiratory infection			2
' our study is the first of its kind since rather than looking for the pathogen , which is notoriously difficult to do in historical samples , we are looking at the immune system protein profile of the ‘ patient ’ , which more accurately tells us that there was indeed an infection at the time of death			1
’ or ‘ our study opens the door to solving many historical and current biomedical and forensic mysteries , from understanding why the plague of 1918 was so lethal , to finding out which pathogen is responsible for death in cases of multiple infections			0

first time infection has been diagnosed in ancient body
new technique could be used to study diseases such as @entity259 flu
could be used to *prevent* re-emergence of deadly diseases of past
