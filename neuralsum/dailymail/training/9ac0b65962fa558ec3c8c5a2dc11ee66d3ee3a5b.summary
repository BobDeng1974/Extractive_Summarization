@entity0 received a useful education but little in the way of glory as his first @entity5 appearance on merit ended in a straight sets defeat			1
the 20 year - old from @entity9 , who came through three qualifying matches , went down 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 in an hour and ten minutes to powerful @entity13 @entity12 , failing to make up a ranking deficit of more than 150 places			1
with @entity16 bowing out it was left to @entity18 to try and join @entity19 in the singles second round of the @entity21 as he took on @entity23 's @entity22			0
@entity0 put in a brave performance against @entity13 's @entity12 in the first round @entity0 arrived on court and had to wait for @entity12 to arrive as he was running seven minutes late @entity0 will now head to @entity27 to play in a challenger level event next week playing on a remote outside court in the shadow of the giant @entity31 , @entity0 did not disgrace himself against the much improved @entity32 , who in the past twelve months has cut his ranking from 157 to 38			1
the big - serving @entity12 was sometimes troubled by @entity0 's potent forehand but managed to break once each in the first two sets , with the qualifier unable to take his one break point created as the @entity13 tried to serve it out in the opener			1
@entity12 was too strong for the young @entity42 as he progressed in straight sets @entity0 stayed with him admirably until halfway through the second , but the gap in experience and quality began to tell and there was no way back from the early break in the third			1
the @entity52 player , who has appeared at @entity53 but only with the help of a wildcard , peppered the @entity12 backhand but could never quite break it down			2
he went down with a second break of serve in the third set but is bound to have gleaned a lot from his @entity61 experience			0
he now heads for a challenger level event in @entity27 next week away from the bright lights of the @entity5			1
@entity0 faces competing against a tough generation of contemporaries – as demonstrated by the likes of @entity67 and @entity68 here – and admitted he needs to keep improving			2
' to qualify here through three matches was a good experience , but i need to keep working on my return to get into the rallies			0
you learn more from your losses			0
the more matches you play at this level the more comfortable it becomes			2
' i 'm in a strong generation , there are quite a few coming through but i have to focus on what i 'm doing and bring my game to the court			0
i have n't faced many players with that kind of serve i faced today			0

@entity12 beat @entity0 in straight sets 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3
it was the first time @entity0 had qualified for a @entity5 on merit
@entity0 will now play in a @entity95 event in @entity27 next week
