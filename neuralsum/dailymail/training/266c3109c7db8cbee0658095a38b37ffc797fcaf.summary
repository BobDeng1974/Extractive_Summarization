by @entity0 going on a helicopter ride , visiting the other side of the world , learning to speak a new language ... these are the kind of dreams that top ' bucket lists ' , catalogues of experiences we want to achieve before we ' kick the bucket '			2
but it is n't just humans that have dreams to realise and goals to achieve : man 's best friend does too			2
besotted pet owners from across the country have , along with a group of dog behaviour experts , created a ' bucket list ' detailing the 50 must - do experiences for every cool canine			1
flopping in front of a roaring fire came top of the bucket list for dogs doing the ' @entity31 shake ' and riding in a car should be experienced by every dog at least once in their lifetime the achievements range from the lavish ( having a personalised kennel , staying in a boutique dog hotel ) , and the loving ( appearing in the family portrait , having a @entity40 stocking ) , to the more unusual ( becoming an internet star and being a ring bearer at a wedding , a task performed by @entity47 's golden retreiver @entity45 at her recent nuptials to @entity49 ) and the downright ordinary ( swimming in the sea , riding in a car )			1
with such an extensive list to complete , most of @entity54 's pooches have pawed their way through just a small number of the must - do items			1
in fact , a howling one in 12 adult dogs have not experienced any of the 50 activities , while just seven per cent have completed the bucket list in its entirety			1
why should humans have all the fun , eh ? so insurance company @entity67 , who commissioned the list , has created an app to help dogs and their owners find the best places to start ticking off their must - dos around the @entity54			1
the most basic of canine and companion pleasures have seen a woefully low completion rate across the country			2
some 20 per cent of dogs never having had the pleasure of bounding through a forest			2
and over a quarter ( 26 per cent ) never knowing what it 's like to attend a family picnic			2
looking across the nation , it would seem that itâ € ™ s in - land areas that are home to the most quest - driven pups and owners , as more @entity95 dogs have completed the bucket list than any others ( 11 per cent )			1
chomping at their heels are dogs in the flat lands of @entity102 ( 10 per cent ) , while the four - legged friends that call the capital home take a respectable third place in the enrichment stakes ( nine per cent )			0
talking about the campaign and the research findings , tv vet @entity110 said , ' make no mistake about it , we 're a nation of dog - lovers , but it seems a lot of owners have become stuck in a rut			1
' taking our dogs on morning and evening walks during the week and out to a park at the weekend has become the norm			0
' understanding and appreciating the many different things you can now do with your dog will greatly enrich the lives of both you and your four - legged friends ' 1			1
