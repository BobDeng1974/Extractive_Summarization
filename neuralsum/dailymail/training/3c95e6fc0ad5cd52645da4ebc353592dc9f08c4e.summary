on september 12 , 1989 , @entity0 humiliated @entity1 with a record 9 - 0 thumping at @entity3 in the old @entity4			1
but the teams met again later in the season and this time , remarkably , @entity1 won a thrilling @entity8 semi-final at @entity9 , 4 - 3 after extra-time			1
@entity0 went on to win their 18th league title while @entity1 lost the cup final after a replay to @entity14 — giving @entity15 his first major domestic honour in @entity17			1
as @entity1 take on @entity0 in the @entity8 fifth round at @entity20 on saturday , @entity18 talks to members of the @entity1 squad for their memories of that incredible season			1
@entity25 celebrates after scoring the winner in the 1990 @entity8 semi-final win against @entity0 earlier in the season @entity1 were beaten 9 - 0 at @entity3 - @entity29 scores the third goal @entity31 ( @entity1 captain ) the league game at @entity3 was a nightmare			1
the last few minutes were particularly torturous			2
we were 8 - 0 down and desperate not to let it slip into double figures			1
@entity39 was running around crying tears of frustration			2
for us , a side that had just been promoted to the @entity4 , the match amounted to a real lesson ; a crash course in playing football at the highest level			1
@entity49 scored @entity0 ’s ninth in the 90th minute			1
no time to score a 10th at least ! but @entity51 told us we had embarrassed ourselves when we returned to the dressing room			2
being a @entity0 lad it really hurt him			1
his family had been there for his first game at @entity3 as a manager			1
defender @entity59 stoops to score @entity0 's fourth goal against @entity1 in the league game at @entity3 palace captain @entity31 ( left ) tries to escape the attention of @entity63 in the @entity8 semi-final how the two sides lined up for both games in the 1989 - 90 season there were freakish elements to the game			1
every chance they had seemed to result in a goal			2
they had eight different scorers			2
i remember hitting the post when it was 0 - 0			1
but then i also remember putting a penalty in row z when we were 6 - 0 down ! as captain i was so angry , i just wanted to burst the net			1
had i just side - footed the ball softly towards @entity86 i reckon he would have let it in , he felt that sorry for us			1
those were the days when we still had a team bath and @entity91 broke the ice			2
‘ i reckon they ’ll do ok this season , ’ he said , and we all had to duck under the water to keep the noise of our laughter from the manager			1
we drew 1 - 1 at @entity101 in the next game before beating @entity103 in our first game back at @entity20			1
by the end of the season we stayed up comfortably , finishing 15th			1
midfielder @entity107 fires home @entity0 's second goal after 16 minutes the only real casualty of that night at @entity3 was our goalkeeper , @entity111			1
i did n’t think he was to blame but @entity49 responded by spending £ 1million on @entity112			1
over the next seven months we learned to cope better with the demands of top - flight football			1
and @entity49 worked us really hard in training , to make sure we were fit enough to deal with @entity0 come that semi-final			1
we used to do these cross-country runs and hill repetition sessions in @entity119			2
the place was called @entity121 , which was a little ironic given how unpleasant training could be			2
every friday we ’d play a north versus south game , which could be really competitive			2
the foreign lads were on our team			0
they were always close but the southerners were n’t shy in letting us know when they came out on top			0
current @entity1 manager @entity25 scores the winner in 109th minute to send @entity1 to the final we went into the semi-final much more confident			1
@entity49 wanted us to keep it tight , frustrate them			0
they were pushing hard to win the championship and he said if we could limit them to a goal or two by half - time , we ’d have a fighting chance			2
we went into the break 1 - 0 down			1
going out for the second half one of the lads cried : ‘ come on , let ’s make history ’			0
that day was one of the best atmospheres i ever played in			0
before @entity148 had even taken his seat we equalised			0
@entity91 burst down the right — he was really quick — and put in a great cross for @entity152			1
then we scored from a set - piece to take the lead			2
@entity155 put us in front , only for @entity0 to score twice in two minutes with eight minutes left			1
one or two of our lads thought we were done but enough of us remained defiant			0
we felt we were finishing the stronger of the two sides and after @entity160 equalised we hit the woodwork again before the game went to extra-time			2
@entity164 mobbed by team - mates after sealing a famous 4 - 3 win for @entity1 against @entity148 's side of course , it was @entity25 who got the winner — 109 minutes			1
the lads were delighted for @entity173			0
he was hugely popular in that dressing room			0
we had some good players but along with myself and @entity160 he gave the team its engine room			2
we were a close - knit bunch			2
even today we remain in touch			0
@entity39 and @entity182 are supporting my charity bike rides this summer to raise money for @entity185 , the charity run by @entity186 , the professor who saved my life			0
as for @entity188 , i was delighted to see him become @entity1 manager			1
he ’s a bit misunderstood			0
some people mistake his self - confidence , which you need as a manager , for over-confidence			2
@entity25 always believed in hard graft , honest endeavour			0
it was a quality of the palace team that got to the @entity8 final that year			1
it ’s a reason why he ’s one of the best @entity17 managers around today			0
@entity25 clenches his fists as he celebrates in front of the @entity1 supporters at @entity9 @entity112 ( @entity1 goalkeeper in the semi-final ) i can remember leaving the training ground the day before the match , when we went up to @entity213			1
it was n’t just the players , it was people from the training ground too			2
we passed a church that had a sign that read : ‘ with @entity223 all things are possible ’			0
the lady who used to give us our lunches pointed it out			0
we were n’t particularly religious , but maybe it was a sign			0
on the day itself , @entity51 said if we kept it tight we ’d have a chance because we had some fit guys			0
they were the footballers but we were very fit			0
@entity0 striker @entity29 finishes past @entity1 keeper @entity112 in the semi-final at @entity9 @entity29 scored and we came in 1 - 0 down but we got an early goal and then made the mistake of going ahead with too long to go ! they switched on and had a spell where they re-took the lead			1
you had a sense that they thought that was where they belonged and i think they took their eye off it a @entity251 you take your foot off the gas like that it ’s hard to put your foot back down			0
when @entity25 scored the winner it was difficult for me to celebrate			0
i ’m inwardly celebrating but then that ’s replaced by having to make sure we do n’t concede			0
that final 11 minutes ? the longest 11 minutes of my career			0
@entity112 went on to play for @entity261 and @entity262 in the @entity263 after seven years at @entity1 @entity152 ( scored for @entity1 in the semi-final ) after the 9 - 0 game , @entity265 asked @entity31 : ‘ can i ask you a serious question ? do you train with a ball or do you just run ? ’ fast - forward to later that season and the motorway is packed full of @entity1 supporters having just beaten @entity0 in the semi-final			1
on the way back from @entity9 , i ’m in a car with @entity39 , who missed the game with injury			0
we come to a standstill because of the traffic and @entity283 is sitting out of the sunroof drinking champagne			0
fans are running out of their cars to hug us			0
@entity283 had his leg in plaster but he was so happy because he had the chance to play in an @entity8 final			1
speaking about it i get goose pimples			0
at full - time , @entity160 shouts in my ear : ‘ we are going to play at @entity295 ! ’ @entity152 ( far right ) joins in the celebrations as @entity1 team - mates congratulate @entity25 it ’s magical			1
when @entity25 scores the winner , i ca n’t explain to you how it feels			0
the pendulum kept swinging in the game			0
to play in it , you knew you were playing in a special game			0
just before the start of extra-time , the manager said to us : ‘ this is your time , you have to grasp it			0
you ’re fitter , younger and hungrier			0
’ and he was right , it was our day			0
during the final 10 minutes , i just kept asking the referee : ‘ how long left ? ’ you ’re just thinking to yourself : ‘ no - one make a mistake			2
’ you try to block @entity295 out , but you ca n’t help it			0
one headline the next day read : ‘ the best day ’s tv since man stepped foot on the moon			0
