by @entity0 @entity1 will miss the @entity2 next week and could be out for the rest of the summer as well after undergoing surgery for a herniated disc on monday			1
the 38 - year - old revealed the stunning news in a statement on his website that not only ruled him out of @entity10 but cast grave doubt on his participation for the @entity13 in june and also the season ’s other two majors as well			1
‘ after attempting to get ready for the masters and failing to make the necessary progress i decided , in consultation with my doctors , to have this procedure done , ’ said @entity1			1
it looks like i will be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation			0
’ this will be the first time @entity1 has missed the masters since he competed as an amateur in 1995			1
he has been struggling on and off with his back since last august			0
he withdrew from the @entity51 at the beginning of last month with five holes to play and was clearly still in pain at the @entity55			0
that was three weeks ago , during which time he had hoped rest and intense physio would do the trick			2
that all ended on monday with microdiscectomy surgery in @entity62 , @entity63			2
@entity1 is hoping to be back chipping and putting by the end of this month but even if that happened he would still be a long way from being able to swing a driver , and a return to competition			1
where it all began : @entity1 receives the @entity2 green jacket from 1996 winner @entity73 in 1997 @entity74 - 15/2 @entity75 - 8/1 @entity76 - 14/1 @entity77 - 18/1 @entity78 - 20/1 odds provided by @entity80 the recovery period is listed as two to three months before someone can usually think about putting stress on the back , which would clearly leave him in a race against time to be ready for the summer programme			1
then there ’s the @entity90 at @entity91 in september			1
to play in that , he would almost certainly need a wild card and while captain @entity95 would be happy to hand him one if he has fully recovered , would a man who has undergone such a delicate operation really want to risk being on a course in cold conditions in the heat of competition for 12 hours a day ? a bad back is the dread of every golfer			0
the surgery was described as successful on @entity1 ’s website but the truth is there is no guarantee it will work when it comes to practising for hours at a time			1
the specialist nature of the surgery and the fact this could prove career - defining was underlined by the fact he had the operation done 2,000 miles from his home in @entity119			1
@entity120 : woods injured his achilles after playing from under the @entity124 tree at the 2011 masters crocked : woods withdrew from the @entity127 in 2011 after nine holes , left and the @entity37 played through the pain barrier on his way to winning the @entity131 carted off : @entity1 is driven off the course after picking up a neck injury at the @entity127 in 2010 red alert : @entity1 has been plagued with back problems in recent events @entity13 : june 12 - 15 the @entity13 : july 17 - 20 @entity37 pga championship : august 7 - 10 whatever the outcome , this is unquestionably another massive blow for the world no 1 , who was the most impressive athlete the sport had ever seen in his twenties but who has been blighted by one injury after another in his thirties			1
the most serious came in 2008 , when he tore his anterior cruciate knee ligament and was out for eight months			0
he has also withdrawn from events owing to a damaged achilles and a bad neck			0
this was supposed to be the year when @entity1 got back on the majors trail after a drought stretching back six years			1
three of the majors are being staged at venues where he has won while the fourth , the @entity13 , is at @entity160 where he finished runner - up in 2005 and third in 1999			2
now his hopes for the year are up in the air and the long - term looks more uncertain than ever			1
‘ it ’s tough right now , but i ’m absolutely optimistic about the future , ’ said a defiant @entity1 , as he contemplated the two great goals of his professional life – surpassing @entity169 ’s all - time record of 82 @entity171 wins and @entity173 ’s total of 18 majors			1
racking up the green : @entity1 won the masters in 2005 last triumph : @entity1 stands with runner - up @entity180 after winning the @entity13 in 2008 after a play - off at @entity183 nice fit : @entity1 adjusts the @entity2 green jacket in 2002 after his win at @entity10 silver service : @entity1 looks at the @entity189 trophy after his win in 2005 triple crown : @entity1 celebrates winning his third @entity13 title in 2006 major force : @entity1 holds up the @entity13 trophy after his win in 2000 , left , and 2002 while this injury would have to be virtually career - ending for @entity1 not to overtake @entity169 – he has 79 victories to his point – the number posted by the @entity173 has never looked more out of reach since the day @entity1 turned up at @entity10 in 1997 and won his first major by 12 shots			1
it had all looked set up perfectly for this season , too			0
@entity1 has played 65 majors and won 14 – exactly the same figures managed by @entity173 at the same age			1
now @entity1 needs to win either the @entity13 or the @entity131 to keep pace but will he even get the chance ? naturally , @entity1 is n’t remotely thinking of giving up the fight			2
‘ there are a couple of records by two outstanding individuals that i hope one day to break , ’ he said			0
‘ as i ’ve said many times , @entity169 and @entity173 reached their milestones over an entire career			0
i plan to have a lot of years left in mine			0
’ it was a rare note of optimism on a grim day not only for @entity1 but the sport itself			2
june 2008 : in obvious discomfort @entity1 plays through the pain to win the @entity13 at @entity183			2

it later emerges he had also suffered a double stress fracture in his left tibia while preparing for the tournament			0

initial reports claim that @entity1 was in a serious condition and his wife had used a golf club to smash the window of the car before dragging him clear			2
december 2009 : after a second woman comes forward claiming to have had an affair with @entity1 he admits to ' transgressions '			2
