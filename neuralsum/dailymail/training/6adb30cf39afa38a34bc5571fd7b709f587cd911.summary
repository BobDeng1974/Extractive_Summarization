if you 're not going to sell @entity1 because of its ' adult ' content then prepare for a backlash of biblical proportions			1
furious gamers are demanding that if @entity6 and @entity7 are going to pull the r - rated game from their shelves then they should do the same to the @entity10 as well			1
@entity6 decided to scrap sales of the popular game after an online petition slammed it for encouraging players to ' commit sexual violence and kill women '			1
the petition , authored by former sex workers , has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures			1
it says the ' sickening game ' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on @entity6 to stop selling it			1
but the gamers have argued that the @entity10 's content is much , much worse			1
the petition page headline reads : ‘ @entity49 – this sickening book encourages readers to commit sexual violence and kill women			1
’ so far the petition has 22,359 supporters , and in the petition the @entity10 is described as a book that ' encourages readers to murder women for entertainment			1
' ' the incentive is to commit sexual violence against women , then abuse or kill them to proceed or get ' god ' points – and now @entity6 are stocking it and promoting it for your @entity69 stocking , ' reads the petition			1
this book means that after various sex acts , readers are given options to kill women by stoning her unconscious , setting them on fire , cutting off their hands , and killing their children ! ' this misogynistic book literally makes a game of bashing , killing and horrific violence against women			1
' however the former sex workers petition made it clear why they were against @entity1 being sold			1
' games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women , ' the petition said			2
general manager of corporate affairs @entity96 said @entity6 would no longer sell the game			1
' we 've been speaking to many customers over recent days about the game , and there is a significant level of concern about the game 's content , ' he said in a statement on wednesday			0
' we 've also had customer feedback in support of us selling the game , and we respect their perspective on the issue			2
@entity28 is an avid fan of the game and even has her own @entity1 character called ' @entity116 ' ' however , we feel the decision to stop selling @entity33 is in line with the majority view of our customers			1
' manager of @entity123 site @entity124 says the move is ' ridiculous ' and disputes claims that the game incites violence towards women			2
' i remember playing it as a 10 - year - old , my parents got it for me , ' she told @entity135			0
' it never offended me , it does n't offend me now and i grew up alight			0
' i do n't go out and mow down people or pull a gun out and spray them or anything , so i just think it 's a little bit over the top			0
' @entity142 claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women are in short supply			2
she said she was ' speechless ' as to why @entity1 had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who wo n't let their kids play the game , would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of @entity155 , or read a chapter from @entity157			2
' if i do n't like someone 's clothing , i 'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts , ' she said			0
' if i do n't like it , i do n't look at it , because i 've got better things to do			0
' @entity142 believes the campaigners against the game are ' misinformed ' and ' threw a tantrum ' when they did n't get what they wanted			0
' i 'm all for feminists and women 's rights but this is going a bit too far			0
26 - year - old @entity142 believes big retailers such as @entity7 and @entity6 should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition			2
' i do n't know why gamers should be punished for something that 's not our fault , or the retailers fault because they 've gone through all the standards and checked the game , ' she said			2
the petition , authored by former sex workers , has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures			1
it says the ' sickening game ' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on @entity6 to stop selling it @entity142 said she understand the anger from former sex workers who launched the online petition , but believes @entity1 gamers do not play out these acts in the real world			1
' it 's up to the gamer to choose , ' she said			0
' i 've played the story from start to finish , i 'm 26 - years - old , i 'm a female and i was not once offended , i was not once appalled by the content , ' she said			0
' there are prostitutes in the game , there is a strip club in the game but very few of them that you see			2
' reports that the game depicts women as bimbos and prey for men has angered @entity142			0
' most of them are actually dressed quite normally			0
' games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women , ' the petition said ' these people actually look like they 're going to work , they 've got the content that perfect that some people are in uniform or they 're in work clothes or summer gear			2
' @entity142 said little children are the worst offenders in online forums			0
' they 're the ones that taunt you on the microphone , saying ' i 'm going to f * * k you mum ' and ' f you this ' , and ' f that ' , it 's insane and they should n't be playing it ' she said			0
' most people have grown up playing video games like that and we 're fine , ' ' we do n't go shooting up people and punching cops ' @entity142 said there are other children 's games available that are much more dangerous			0
' there 's also another game which a lot of children play called @entity257 and a lot of sexual predators are on that game			0
general manager of corporate affairs @entity96 said @entity6 would no longer sell @entity33 the young gamer worries that this ban will effect future sales of @entity1 as there will be a monopoly on who will be able to sell the game			1
ultimately , she said it 's really going to effect gamers who are keen on playing the game			0
' my worry is that it 's going to be banned so it 's going to be a problem for future games , ' she said			0
mr @entity96 said @entity6 would continue to sell other r - rated dvds and games			1
' while these products often contain imagery that some customers find offensive , in the vast majority of cases , we believe they are appropriate products for us to sell to adult customers , ' he said			0
' however , in the case of @entity33 , we have listened to the strong feedback from customers that this is not a product they want us to sell			2
' @entity33 is an award - winning game which set a sales record for entertainment products , passing the $ 1 billion sales mark after three days .			1

general manager of corporate affairs @entity96 said @entity6 would no longer sell @entity33

a petition , authored by former sex workers , was the reason why @entity1 sales were scrapped
it said the ' sickening game ' encouraged players to kill prostitutes and *convinced* @entity6 to stop selling it
