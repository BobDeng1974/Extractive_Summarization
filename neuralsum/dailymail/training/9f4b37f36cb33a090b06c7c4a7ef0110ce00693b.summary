for more than a decade there have been sightings of unusual high - speed watercraft patrolling up and down the @entity3 between @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity7			1
the vessels belong to the @entity9 and are part of an ongoing project called @entity12 , which stands for @entity14 ( @entity13			1
despite being in existence for more than a decade , the project remains shrouded in mystery , although over the years some information has been discovered			2
for more than a decade there have been sightings of unusual high - speed watercraft on the @entity3 , the vessels belong to the @entity9 and are part of an ongoing project called @entity12 sealion is an experiment between the @entity26 's @entity25 and the @entity27			1
launched in 2000 , the brief was to develop a high - speed , low observable / low radar signature craft that could operate in the littorals i.e. the part of sea close to shore			2
the @entity26 's intention was to use the craft as a medium - range method of transporting seals without appearing on the enemy 's radar			1

the @entity26 's intention was to use the craft as a medium - range method of transporting seals without being appearing on the enemy 's radar launched in 2000 , the @entity12 brief was to develop a high - speed , low observable / low radar signature craft that could operate in the littorals i.e. the part of sea close to shore ‘ the purpose of the project was to build a demonstration craft to explore the use of technology that may have future application in the @entity62 , ’ said capt. @entity54 , one - time commander of @entity42 , speaking about the original version of the craft			1
known simply as @entity12 , it measured 71 feet and required a crew of one or two sailors to operate			0
it was capable of 40 knots under normal conditions and no less than 30 knots in sea states as high as level five			0
the original @entity12 , cost $ 9 million and was delivered in 2003 when a demonstration is understood to have taken place			1
however the boat was never put into production and instead the decision was taken to develop the slightly more advanced @entity12 ll			2
sealion is operationally controlled by @entity41 ( @entity42 ) 4 at @entity43 , @entity44 , a rear opening garage - like door would allow for deployment and recovery of these craft with relative ease and without compromising the boat 's stealth capabilities for more than a short period of time it appears to have been a refinement of the original design and is rumored to have offered an even lower radar cross section than its predecessor , but was also big enough to carry an unspecified number of @entity9 and a modular mission payload			2
it also required just a single crewman to operate			0
the state - of - the - art electronics suite included a retractable @entity100 turret , communications array and radar , along with a highly automated command and control system			0
according to @entity54 , @entity42 4 was looking at @entity12 as a potential platform for weapons systems and intelligence collection			0
a rear opening garage - like door would allow for deployment and recovery of these craft with relative ease and without compromising the boat 's stealth capabilities for more than a short period of time			0
despite being in existence for more than a decade , the @entity12 project remains surrounded in mystery , although over the years some information has been disclosed another supposed benefit of the @entity12 ll was that it could be used to sneak up on a moving target , such as a large ship			2
without showing up on its radar would clearly offer a huge advantage over boats normally used for missions which do not feature a high degree of ' low observable ' technology			0
it is n't clear if the @entity12 ll has ever become even semi-operational within the @entity26 , but the program appears to remains active because new boats keep appearing on the @entity3 year after year			1
even boaters who have spotted a @entity134 visually as it is semi-submerged say that it does not show up on their commercial grade radars , which is at least some proof to the @entity12 's cloaking capabilities			0
