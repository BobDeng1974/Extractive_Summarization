by @entity0 @entity1 has branded the obsession with the way in which managers carry themselves as ' nonsense ' and claims some only continue to get hired because of the way they project themselves			1
the 45 - year - old was sacked as @entity11 manager at the end of last season despite enjoying a modicum of success at @entity16			1
many believe that decision was down to his touchline demeanour and outspoken nature in the press , but @entity1 stands by his style			1
different to the rest : @entity1 was lively during his spell as manager of @entity11 last season paying the price for enthusiasm ? the 45 - year - old was sacked by chairman @entity29 at @entity16 ' i do n't care about perception , ' the former @entity31 midfielder wrote in his @entity35 column			1
' my reactions on the touchline were emotionally honest			1
' when you are out there on your own you go through massive highs and lows			1
i do n't think it is wrong to show your emotions			2
' but it is something that is picked up on by people in football			2
and there are some managers who use it to their advantage			2
there are a lot of actors out there			2
' two men who ca n't be accused of any calculated emotion are @entity59 and @entity60			1
the @entity62 and @entity63 bosses have been real characters at this summer 's @entity65 and have lived every moment of their sides ' tournament thus far			0
the pair go into this weekend with real chances of upsetting the apple cart ; @entity63 play @entity72 on saturday with @entity73 waiting for the @entity74			0
characters : @entity62 's @entity59 ( left ) and @entity63 's @entity60 have lit up this summer 's @entity65 and the energy given off by their respective bosses is something @entity1 has admired			1
' i like @entity62 's coach @entity59			1
he is there in the moment , ' he said			0
' there is nothing forced about him			0
he prowls around that technical area with intensity			0
he does n't spend any time checking how he looks on the stadium screens			0
' as a football person , i like that			0
' he added : ' i have spoken to a few people in football since i left @entity11			0
many of them have told me that if i had kept my mouth shut on certain issues i might still be manager			0
there are some people at football clubs who think that the demeanour of a manager , what he says to the press and the television after the match , is more important than how he prepares his team			0
