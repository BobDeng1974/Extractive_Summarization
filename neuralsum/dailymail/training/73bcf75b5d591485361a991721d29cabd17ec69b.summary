an inspection report which failed the first privately - run @entity2 hospital made at least 200 errors , the watchdog has admitted			1
the @entity5 last month declared @entity6 , @entity7 , was inadequate , with the lowest ever patient care score			1
that same day , @entity9 , the private firm running the exemplary hospital , pulled out of its contract			0
they include an inspector who was a member of @entity28 and another who had warned of the dangers of private firms ’ involvement in the @entity2			2
yesterday , @entity5 chief @entity33 admitted to the @entity34 that the report contained about 200 inaccuracies , from false allegations against staff , and mistakes in data about care , to basic but sloppy typing errors			1
committee member @entity43 , @entity44 mp for @entity45 , described the @entity5 as a ‘ lynch mob ’			1
he asked mr @entity33 : ‘ what is it , a used car salesmanship ? it is supposed to be a proper regulatory body			0
this is why one of your own staff admitted it was a lynch mob … you should be ashamed of yourself			1
’ he added : ‘ are you fit for purpose for judging an organisation which in may 2014 was winning awards … whereas within four or five months your report , based on anecdotes , some might say tittle - tattle , rates it as inadequate and one of the worst inspections the @entity5 has ever undertaken ? ’ mp @entity43 described the @entity5 as a ' lynch mob ' and a ' used car salesmanship ' the @entity68 were told some of the report ’s most serious allegations were in fact misunderstandings by the watchdog			1
in one instance , an inspector claimed to have heard an @entity77 doctor shouting abusively at a patient			0
it later transpired the doctor was speaking loudly to the man because he was profoundly deaf			0
a student nurse criticised by the @entity5 for telling a patient ‘ you know what happens when you misbehave ’ , was found to have been sharing a joke with him to make him feel more comfortable so he would eat			2
senior circle managers told mps they had found 300 inaccuracies in the report			1
the @entity5 has since admitted to about two thirds of these but has refused to change the ‘ inadequate ’ rating			1
@entity93 , chief executive of @entity6 , said he had asked the @entity5 to provide written notes to back up its allegations but it has so far failed to do so			1
the hospital will now be put back in the hands of the @entity2			1
but it is deemed unprofitable and there are fears it will be closed or taken over by a larger hospital			0
it has also emerged a senior @entity2 manager who oversaw the flawed contract for @entity9 ’s takeover walked away with a £ 400,000 pay - off			2
sir @entity108 was chief of the @entity109 and @entity110 when the deal was signed in 2011			0
but in 2012 when the authority was abolished he received £ 465,000 in redundancy pay with a pension pot valued at £ 2million			0
mps heard he is still being paid by the @entity2 as he has set up a consultancy advising organisations in the @entity109			2
there are growing suspicions the inspection of @entity121 , in @entity7 , was a stitch - up , heavily influenced by @entity23 figures and other individuals who oppose privatisation following @entity9 ’s takeover in february 2012 , @entity6 ’s @entity77 waiting times and those for cancer patients were among the lowest in the @entity2			1
patient satisfaction scores went up and in may last year it was rated the top hospital in the country by healthcare data monitors @entity134			0
but an investigation by this newspaper last month revealed the deal may have been doomed from the start as members of the local @entity2 body opposed privatisation			2
the @entity142 slashed the hospital ’s finances and imposed arbitrary fines			0
two members are @entity23 activists , including chairman @entity147 , formerly a senior @entity149 member			2
there are concerns the report was heavily influenced by the opinions of anti-privatisation inspectors – including dr @entity155 , previously a senior member of doctors ’ union the @entity159 , who had warned of the dangers of privatisation			0
another inspector , dr @entity162 , had been a signed - up supporter of @entity28 since its launch in 2005			0
the @entity5 has since said it will force inspectors to disclose links to organisations which may distort their opinions .			0
