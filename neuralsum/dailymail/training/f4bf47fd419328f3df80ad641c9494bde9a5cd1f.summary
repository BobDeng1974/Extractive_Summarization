as she showcased her toned physique on the cover of this month 's @entity4 , @entity0 proved that 40 really is the new 20			1
and the 42 - year - old @entity6 actress is n't the only over- 40 giving women half her age a run for their money			1
@entity4 has celebrated women at 42 in it 's latest issue - and that includes the likes of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
forty is the new twenty : @entity0 , looking younger and better than ever , covers the august issue of @entity4 and one of its writer even dedicated an entire article in praise of 42 - year - olds like her in praise of the older woman , writer @entity25 says in @entity4 : ' let 's face it : there used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty - two - year - old woman			1
' with half her life still ahead of her , she was deemed to be at the end of something - namely , everything society valued in her , other than her success as a mother			2
' if she remained sexual , she was either predatory or desperate ; if she remained beautiful , what gave her beauty force was the fact of its fading			2
and if she remained alone ... well , then @entity46 help her			2
' but with @entity0 gracing its glossy cover in all her toned glory , the men 's magazine believe that what 's made these women figures of fantasy is their confidence			1
all hail 42 : writing in praise of the older woman , like 42 - year - old @entity15 , writer @entity57 argues that there used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty - two - year - old woman , now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free ' a few generations ago , a woman turning forty - two was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention ; now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free , ' writes @entity25			1
and this seems to be backed up by recent research , which revealed that today 's over 40 's generally feel happier , as well as wiser and more confident than they did in their 20 's			2
the study found that 56 per cent of women over 40 believe they look younger than their actual age			1
the research , carried out by nice ' n ' easy , also found that 64 per cent of women over 40 say if they could give one piece of advice to their 20 - year - old selves , they would tell them to have confidence in themselves			1
happy and confident : recent research revealed that today 's over 40 's , like @entity14 , left , and @entity18 , right , both 42 , generally feel happier , as well as wiser and more confident than they did in their 20 's @entity0 even said in a recent interview : ‘ [ this ] is the best time of my life			1
i love being this age			1
i ca n’t wait to be older			0
the most interesting parts are for women who are over 40			1
we do n’t see it that way , because they ’re not the sexy parts			0
‘ we ’re not giving those women enough credit for what they ’re accomplishing , which is beautiful performances			1
’ @entity25 does , however , points out : ' of course , they have to work for their advantage ; they have armored themselves with yoga and @entity104 even as they joke about the spectacle			0
' and right he is , @entity0 is a huge yoga advocate and is often spotted working out at the gym			0
she even penned @entity109 : @entity110 , the science of strength , and other ways to love your amazing body			0
staying in shape : @entity0 is a huge health advocate and even penned @entity109 : @entity110 , the science of strength , and other ways to love your amazing body in it , @entity0 passes down lessons gleaned through personal experience and as a result of her access to the top nutritionists in the world			0
she writes about healthy meal choices , which she discussed during a wednesday appearance on dr. @entity129 @entity14 is also a yoga devotee , while @entity15 says working out is not her idea of enjoyment			0
‘ for me it ’s punishment , ’ she said recently			0
however , the @entity135 star , who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 28 , says she knows exercise is important for her health and tries to work out three times a week with celebrity trainer @entity140 , or she does spinning and @entity104			0
@entity141 , journalist and author of forthcoming book @entity144 , mused : ‘ as the life expectancy goes up , the mean age for " youth " increases			1
' ever since @entity149 hit tv screens in the eighties - way before @entity153 - women have redefined age on their own terms - glamour and sex are no longer the preserve of twentysomethings			1
' @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 are all fine examples of this			0
they illustrate how looking good does n’t necessarily mean looking young			0
‘ meanwhile , men like @entity166 and @entity167 are flying the flag for blokes			0
one of the best films to show sexuality across age lines is @entity173 with @entity174 and @entity175 - it illustrates how , increasingly , age is nothing but a number			2
people are confident in showing their sexual and social duplicity throughout their entire lives			0
’ that said , there is still a double - standard			0
older women with a sexual appetite are considered cougars , whereas guys are written off as dirty old men or creeps			2
women complain about slut shaming and the like , but so many of them are guilty of it in reverse			2
perhaps all this renewed confidence will help end that too			0

@entity4 writer says 42 is the sexiest new age and women have never been so ' free '
