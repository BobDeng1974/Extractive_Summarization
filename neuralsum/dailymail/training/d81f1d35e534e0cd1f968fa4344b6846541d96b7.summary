it has been a horrible season for @entity1 and not much better for record signing @entity2			1
the diminutive @entity5 playmaker went from @entity7 winner and back - to - back player of the year awards at @entity9 to losing his place in the team and being sold to a @entity1 side spiralling down the league			1
it is no surprise , then , that @entity2 has one eye on next season when he believes his new club , without the demands of @entity21 football to distract them , will be well placed to make an immediate return to the top of the pile			1
for both club and player , he believes , it will be a case of ‘ what does n’t kill you makes you stronger ’			1
@entity5 eyes : @entity2 sees a way back to top for @entity1 trophy hunting : @entity2 presents @entity33 with @entity1 's @entity35 award but next season wants the duo to get their hands on the @entity40 trophy take it as @entity42 : @entity2 scores against @entity43 in @entity45 ' first match as @entity1 's caretaker manager hero worship : @entity2 ( right ) with @entity45 , someone the @entity48 idolised growing up on his knees : it has been a horrible season for @entity2 and his new club @entity1 on the scoresheet : @entity2 has scored five goals since joining @entity1 ‘ i went through a situation at @entity9 that i had not been through before in my career , ’ he says			1
‘ i was not playing regularly but i really believe that made me stronger			2
you can lose faith in yourself in adversity but i never did			1
i remained confident and i never lost sight of my objectives			1
’ he believes @entity1 can emulate @entity62 who , unfettered by @entity21 football , have lit up this season with their energetic football			1
‘ it can definitely be an advantage in the league			2
of course , i would rather be playing in the @entity7 , but if we take @entity62 as the example — you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish without having played in the @entity7			2
’ @entity2 already has his own @entity7 winner ’s medal , having planted a corner on @entity80 ’s head for the @entity9 equaliser in that dramatic final in @entity83			1
what he ca n’t be sure about is who will lead the club ’s charge next season to get back into the competition			1
there is an obvious bond with @entity45 , whom he worshipped as a boy			1
the old saying that you should never meet your idols clearly does not apply in this case			2
‘ i told him when i arrived that he had been my hero growing up			2
and he said to me , “ i ’m really happy you ’re here			2
but i ’m a bit sad too because now i ’ve only got the second best left foot at the club			2
” ‘ i told him that was impossible			2
he was the player i watched most closely as a kid			2
i loved the way he controlled the ball and the touch he had			2
he was a pure winger , left - footed , right out on the touchline			2
he was fast , unplayable in a one - on - one situation , and he scored goals			0
now destiny has made him my team - mate and my manager			0
’ @entity2 knows @entity45 ’ reign might not last and is guarded about what the future might hold			1
asked about @entity117 , he says : ‘ i ’ve never met him			0
i know what kind of history he has , the titles he has won and the kind of football he is playing with @entity123			0
but i do n’t think it ’s good to talk about a coach who is not our manager			0
’ if the @entity128 does replace the @entity129 , he will become @entity2 ’s seventh coach in three seasons			1
so much for @entity133 patience and trigger - happy @entity5 club presidents			0
‘ you mean it ’s my fault , ’ he laughs			0
winning smile : @entity2 beams as he lifts the @entity139 trophy in 2013 kings of @entity141 : @entity2 and @entity142 lift the @entity7 trophy after a penalty shootout in 2012 how do the managers compare ? ‘ ( @entity151 ) @entity150 was the person who brought me to @entity133 and who trusted in me			1
he ’s young , he has ambition and he wants to play attractive , fun and winning football			0
i will always be grateful to him			1
‘ @entity155 was a bit like @entity45			1
he was the ex-player , the assistant coach , who stayed when @entity157 left			0
and he was a huge success			0
we won the @entity7 , the @entity160 ... he was fantastic with me and with the whole group			0
he got us all together , all committed			0
‘ then we won the @entity139 ( with @entity162 )			1
it was hard for him at first because of the history he had but i think he did things well			0
he was professional and he won a title — a title that the club had n’t won before			0
why did it not work out ? a lack of communication seems key , although perhaps it was a symptom and not the cause of the problem			0
did he ask @entity168 why he was left out the side ? ‘ no. i did n’t consider it opportune			1
’ did @entity168 ever explain to @entity2 why he did n’t fit ? ‘ @entity177 , ’ he says			1
when the talking did begin it was between @entity9 and @entity1 and it culminated in a helicopter flying him to @entity181 on january 25 this year			1
season of woe : @entity1 have finished outside the top three for the first time in the @entity40 era season to remember : @entity188 and @entity62 have had an excellent season domestically ‘ i will always be grateful to @entity9 , ’ he says			1
‘ to the directors , the owner and the fans , because from the first day to the last they were fantastic			2
no communication : @entity168 did not explain to @entity2 why he was out of the side ‘ i wish them the best , i really do			1
i have a lot of friends there			0
@entity201 ( @entity202 ) , @entity200 ( @entity142 ) , @entity33 ( @entity203 ) , @entity204			1
i talk to @entity205 and @entity206 a lot too			0
i was with them for two and a half years and i wish them the best			0
’ he is proud of the open thank you letter he wrote @entity9 fans when he left			1
‘ i did n’t do that just for the sake of my image , it was heartfelt			0
i wanted to express what i felt about @entity9 , about the fans , who had always treated me so well			1
’ such a public display of affection towards rival supporters might have compromised @entity2 ’s relationship with @entity1 fans but most see it as a measure of the man			1
he is anxious to start wining trophies in a red shirt and he says the critics should stop getting so hung up on which position he plays			0
‘ obviously , i do n’t consider myself an out - an - out right - winger as such , but it offers me the chance to come inside on my left foot , and that way i have a broader field of vision			0
i have also played on the left with @entity238 and with the national team and i liked it there			0
the position that i have played best in is behind the striker			0
but i think i can play in the other two as well			0
’ @entity2 won international youth honours for @entity245 with goalkeeper @entity33 and he believes @entity1 ’s player of the year has the mentality to become an @entity248 great			1
‘ he has huge faith in himself , which is a really important virtue , ’ @entity2 says			1
‘ he does n’t let anything affect him			0
he knows if he has made a mistake but it never sinks him			0
he uses it to make sure that he does n’t make the same mistake next time			2
@entity254 : a @entity9 fan holds up a banner praising @entity2 following his departure to @entity1 ‘ i ’ve spoken to friends about this and they say about @entity260 : “ it ’s as if he does n’t care about anything			1
” he scores goals and acts as if it ’s normal			0
but maybe that ’s a good thing			0
there ’s so much pressure and maybe , if you tell yourself that you have to be brilliant all the time , when you make a mistake you collapse			2
maybe you have to treat it all a bit more ‘ normally ’			0
i think that ’s a quality great players have			0
’ so can @entity277 and @entity2 win together in the red of @entity1 as they have in the red of @entity245 ? ‘ there has been a loss of confidence			1
thirteen months ago , you ’d be losing 3 - 0 and you ’d win 4 - 3 at @entity248 , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ now you ’re losing 3 - 0 and it seems impossible			0
that mentality , that confidence , has not always been there this season			2
but i think the players and the club still have that attitude			0
the fans do , too			2
‘ i remember , with @entity9 , it was almost impossible to win here			1
there are huge demands at this club			0
if you do n’t win the league one year , you must win it the next year			0
next season we have to demonstrate that the club has not lost its essence ; has not lost its mentality ; has not lost its competitiveness ; and it has not lost its identity			1

@entity2 believes @entity1 can get back to the top with no @entity21 distraction
says ' i never lost my faith in myself ' during tough time at @entity9
*reveals* as a boy he worshipped @entity1 caretaker boss @entity45
@entity2 will always be grateful to @entity9 and former managers @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity162
@entity48 did not communicate with @entity168
but @entity2 is proud of open letter he wrote to @entity9 fans after his departure
says @entity33 is goalkeeping equivalent of @entity260
@entity1 have lost their confidence , but must not lose their ' identity '
