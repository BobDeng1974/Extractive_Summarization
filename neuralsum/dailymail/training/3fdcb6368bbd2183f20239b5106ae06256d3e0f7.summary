by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 17 april 2013 women who are overweight and smoke are more likely to suffer menopausal night sweats , according to @entity5 research			1
the study found that women who are overweight , smoke and consume high levels of alcohol are at an increased risk of unpleasant menopause symptoms , but for the first time they were able to link specific lifestyle factors to different menopausal symptoms			1
in the @entity19 , the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52 , although women can experience the menopause in their 30s or 40s			0
feeling flushed : the menopause cause make day - to - day life very difficult common symptoms include hot flushes , night sweats , loss of libido , mood changes and insomnia			1
a hot flush is a sudden feeling of heat in the upper body , which can start in the face , or chest before spreading			0
the face , neck and chest may start to sweat and become red and patchy			0
there can also be a change in heart rate			0
it may become very rapid , irregular or stronger than usual			0
night sweats are hot flushes that occur at night and only last a few minutes			2
they are most common in the first year after your final period			0
the @entity50 ’s @entity49 analysed more than 10,000 @entity5 women aged between 45 and 50 , and investigated their social , lifestyle and reproductive history			2
they found that well - educated women were less likely to suffer with either night sweats or hot flushes			1
however those who had gained weight , drank and smoked heavily or suffered with long - term reproductive problems did tend to suffer with the menopausal symptoms			1
the study found that smoking increased the likelihood of night sweats dr @entity63 , who led the study said : ‘ one of the study 's most interesting findings is women who were smokers or had diabetes were more likely to have night sweats , but were not at increased risk of hot flushes			1
’ dr @entity63 added that while it is not fully understood why certain factors may influence specific symptoms , the study paved the way for more research into how smoking and being overweight made women more vulnerable to night sweats			2
‘ further study is needed , but [ increased incidence of night sweats ] may be explained by a number of reasons , including differing perceptions of the intensity of night sweating by smokers and women with diabetes			0
‘ women with diabetes may experience increased night sweats because of the low glucose levels during the night			0
’ previous studies have shown that certain lifestyle factors that put women at a higher risk of menopausal symptoms in general , but very little research has been carried out on how specific lifestyle choices affect the likelihood of each symptom separately			1
‘ determining the risk factors for these symptoms separately may help clarify their causes , help us identify who is at high risk of developing them and allow for early intervention to avoid or treat them			2

leading an *unhealthy* lifestyle puts women at higher risk of developing unpleasant menopausal symptoms
@entity5 study links specific lifestyle factors and menopausal symptoms for first time
well - educated women least likely to suffer hot flushes
