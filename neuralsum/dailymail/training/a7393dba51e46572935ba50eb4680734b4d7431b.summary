as her two - year - old daughter @entity1 covers her hands in paint then shrieks with delight , @entity0 looks on with amusement			1
her once tidy and ordered home in @entity7 , @entity8 , has descended into a permanent state of noisy chaos , since @entity1 and her baby sister , @entity11 , came along			2
but @entity0 , 49 , would n’t have it any other way			1
@entity0 and @entity14 with @entity1 , left , and @entity11 , right , conceived their children through egg donations in fact , she loves being a mum so much so that she and her partner @entity20 , 46 , are even hoping to start trying for another child next year			1
by then , @entity0 , a social worker , will be 50 , but she says her age does n’t put her off			1
‘ both my pregnancies were easy and i have plenty of energy , so why not ? ’ she said			0
@entity0 conceived @entity1 and then @entity11 through egg donation at @entity27			1
she believed that using the eggs of a younger woman would give her a better chance of getting pregnant			0
the clinic used @entity20 ’s sperm , so he is biologically the girls ’ father			1
but @entity0 has never felt like any less of a mother because of the way the girls came into the world			1
@entity0 , pictured after giving birth to @entity1 in 2012 , said she left having children late in life as she had n't met anyone she wanted to become a parent with @entity0 and @entity20 , pictured at a friend 's wedding , started trying for a baby after they met 10 years ago but were n't able to conceive naturally she said : ‘ i carried them for nine months and gave birth to them and so they could n’t feel more like mine			1
‘ and funnily enough , @entity1 is blonde like me , whereas @entity20 is dark			1
she also has many of my mannerisms			0
‘ if i have a bad day with them both i just joke that they ’re nothing to do with me , ’ she laughs			0
like so many other women her age , @entity0 resents the endless talk about women putting their careers before family and then leaving motherhood too late			2
‘ this certainly was n’t the case for me as i always wanted children , ’ she said			0
' they could n't feel more like mine , ' @entity0 says of @entity11 , left , and @entity1 , right happy family : @entity0 and @entity20 with @entity1 after the birth of @entity11 ‘ i love my job but it is n’t the reason why i ’m having kids now			1
’ she points out that she only got together with @entity20 , a horticulturist , when she was 40 , and up until then she had not met anyone that she actually wanted to have children with			2
the couple met on a bouncy castle at a friend ’s barbecue and they hit it off straightaway			0
‘ we ’re both very laidback and @entity20 is very funny and kind , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i knew he was the one for me			0
’ after a couple of years together , they started trying for a baby but when nothing had happened after a year or two , they began to talk about @entity88			2
‘ we certainly did n’t rush into anything , and we are n’t really the types to panic , ’ she said			0
‘ we both loved our jobs , we had a good social life and a great relationship so i think we realised that if we did n’t have a family it would n’t be the @entity96			0
’ but when the clinic suggested egg donation , they both agreed to give it a go - and they eventually settled on a college - educated , blonde - haired donor			1
@entity0 says she 's a calmer mother to @entity11 , left , and @entity1 , right , now that she is older @entity0 is planning to have a third child next year unfortunately , only one embryo was viable from the eight donor eggs			1
remarkably , though , @entity0 still got pregnant , and she and @entity20 were delighted			1
in spite of her age , she sailed through the pregnancy , giving birth to @entity1 only a couple of hours after finishing work			0
@entity0 jokes that she spent her entire maternity leave simply staring at her daughter			2
‘ i was just mesmerised by her and i did n’t really care about anything else , ’ she said			0
and to her surprise , @entity0 seemed to be a lot more relaxed than many of the other new mums around her			2
according to the mother - of - two , some of the women she met in their 20s were worried about getting things wrong , and were fixated on having all the best equipment for their babies – while @entity0 and @entity20 had bought everything second - hand			1
‘ they worried if their baby had a sniffle or had n’t put on much weight , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i guess being older , i was just more used to trusting my instincts more , and having a bit more perspective on things			2
’ but it was , says @entity0 , the mums in their 30s who seemed the most anxious			2
‘ many just wanted everything to be perfect , ’ she said			0
‘ perfect houses , perfect babies and perfect careers , whereas i just wanted to enjoy my baby , without worrying about what anyone else thought			2
’ other mothers would often comment on how calm @entity0 was , and because she looks young for her age , she says she has never had a problem meeting other mums at playgroups or in the park			2
she and @entity20 loved being parents so much so that when @entity1 was one , they returned to the clinic to start the egg donation process again			1
unfortunately their original donor was no longer available , so they chose another one – and this time they were left with two viable embryos			0
one became @entity11 and the other they have frozen for the future			0
‘ we ’re hoping to go back to the clinic again soon , and it would be great if we could have a third , ’ said @entity0 , who is back at work full - time , having found the girls a child - minder			1
‘ we are fatalistic though			0
if it happens , it happens , but if it does n’t , we have two wonderful girls , and we certainly feel very blessed			0
‘ one thing is for sure though			0
i ’m certainly not going to waste my time wishing i ’d had children when i was younger			0
‘ this works for us			0
we ’re all happy and healthy and i do n’t think i ’d have been quite this relaxed if i ’d embarked on motherhood any earlier			0
