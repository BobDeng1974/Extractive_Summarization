but this is , in fact , a flock of starlings flying in formation at a @entity11 nature reserve			1
the ' fantastic ' , not to mention appropriate , shape came about due to the threat of a nearby @entity14			1
big bird : a flock of starlings flies in formation in the sky above @entity20 in @entity11 once the flock had spotted the predator , it quickly grouped together and inadvertently mimicked the appearance of a giant bird			1
when a hungry predator hovers nearby , the birds must converge , flocking together , in an attempt to confuse the hunter , whether it be a sparrowhawk , buzzard or @entity14			2
these incredible pictures were taken by an amateur photographer at @entity20			1
@entity34 had travelled to the beauty spot specifically to shoot starlings as the area is well known for them			2
the 51 - year - old , himself the manager of a nature reserve in the @entity42 , said : ' normally starlings fly in loose and dispersed flocks			2
but with the @entity14 circling around them they bunched together and coordinated and acted as one			2
' i suppose it is some kind of predatory avoidance strategy , because it will make it more difficult for the falcon to pick out one starling			0
' ' fantastic ' : the appropriate shape came about due to the threat of a nearby @entity14 the mass of birds remained in formation for about 15 minutes until the falcon ceased its pursuit and the starlings scattered			0
mr @entity34 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , added : ' i only realised how good the picture was when i looked back at it			0
' i was just trying to compose a shot without any branches sticking out in the corner , then i found i had got that			0
' i 've never seen anything like it before - it 's fantastic			0
' scientists recently discovered the secret behind starlings ' amazing spatial awareness			1
when they flock together , each starling tracks seven other birds - irrespective of distance - which produces the group 's aerial ballet			0
eventually , in late spring , birds pair off and look for suitable nesting grounds			0
they will not regroup until september , when their amazing daily display will begin again			1
