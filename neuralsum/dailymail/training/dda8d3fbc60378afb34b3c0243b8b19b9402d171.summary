a coral reef in @entity2 severely damaged by warming seas has managed to completely heal itself in just 12 years , stunned researchers have found			1
the team found that being left alone to breed on its own was key			1
the discovery raises hope that other damaged reefs could ' regenerate '			1
@entity8 in @entity2 , where researchers found coral has ' regenerated ' itself after almost 12 years following a warming incident the new research shows that an isolated reef off the northwest coast of @entity2 that was severely damaged by a period of warming in 1998			1
it was hit by coral bleaching , caused by higher water temperatures that break down the coral 's symbiotic relationship with algae that provide food for coral growth			2
however , the team found @entity27 reef has regenerated in a very short time to become nearly as healthy as it was before			1
what surprises scientists , though , is that the reef regenerated by itself , found a study published thursday in the journal @entity34			1
@entity35 and colleagues studied the @entity27 system of reefs on the edge of @entity41 ’s continental shelf , which lost 70 to 90 percent of its corals to a climate - induced bleaching event back in 1998			1
@entity8 is an isolated group of three reefs near the edge of northwestern @entity2 's continental slope the researchers found that , although the corals ’ reproductive abilities were by the bleaching , coral cover still increased from 9 percent to 44 percent across the entire system in just 12 years			1
the team say the finding is surprising because researchers have assumed that recovery from such bleaching events depends upon the delivery of larvae from other , nearby reef systems			1
but , the @entity27 system of reefs is located 155 miles ( 250 kilometers ) from the mainland or any other reefs			0
so , @entity35 and his team suggest that herbivorous fish , which remained abundant in the undisturbed @entity27 system , even after the bleaching , kept microalgae in check and allowed coralline algae to thrive			0
this set of conditions in turn provided a suitable substratum upon which young corals could establish and grow. , they claim			2
the study suggests that reef systems can recover using local sources of larvae , especially when fish are plentiful and human activities , which have been shown to slow coral recovery in the past , are limited			0
at first , the reef grew slowly , mostly through the enlargement of existing coral colonies			0
but to really recover , the coral needs to sexually reproduce , creating sperm and egg that form embryos that then land on the ocean floor and grow into adult corals , if all goes well			2
these larvae can survive for hundreds of miles , swept along by ocean currents , and colonize new areas under the right circumstances			0
larvae floating in from other reefs could have helped the reef , had it not been so isolated			0
but amazingly , after about six years , the surviving corals matured and began to reproduce , creating even more new colonies than before the bleaching			1
' they recovered , and the larvae they produced settled and survived , at much higher rates than is often reported , ' @entity35 said			0
the rate of recovery was attributed to the lack of many local human pressures affecting reefs around the world , such as degraded water quality and overfishing of herbivores by 2012 , the reef was basically back to its old self			0
the study suggests that , when it comes to reefs , being isolated from human activity may trump being connected to other reefs			0
overfishing , for example , removes fish that keep algae from choking out and outcompeting corals , and sediment and pathogens in runoff water can lead to coral diseases and death			2
but the results also mean that local decisions about fishing and other issues can help preserve reefs , which are threatened by global warming			2
' managing local conditions is a tangible way to maximize the resilience of coral reefs while the more difficult problem of addressing the causes of climate change are resolved , ' @entity35 said .			0
