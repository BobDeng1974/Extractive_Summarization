@entity0 are poised to join the heavyweight battle for @entity5 football ’s hottest property @entity2			1
@entity0 have made discreet overtures about @entity2 , despite @entity8 manager @entity7 insisting on thursday that his 20 - year - old striker is going nowhere this summer			1
@entity2 stunned @entity8 earlier this week by giving an interview in which he claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a £ 100,000 - a - week contract and admitting he is ‘ quite flattered ’ by interest from @entity14			1
it has led to suspicions that @entity2 , who was raised in @entity17 and came through the youth system at @entity19 , is agitating for a return to the capital			1
@entity23 leaders @entity0 are poised to join the battle for @entity8 wideman @entity2 however , @entity8 manager @entity7 insists the 20 - year - old star is ' going nowhere ' this summer @entity2 has claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a £ 100,000 - a - week contract now @entity0 want to be kept informed about the forward ’s future as they join the hunt with @entity14 and @entity31			1
but @entity7 said : ‘ he ’s got two - and - a - half years to go on his deal and he ’s not going anywhere in the summer			1
i can not speak for the owners but i have a good idea of what they would do			2
i know them well enough and for me it would not happen			2
@entity8 are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money does n’t come into it			1
if the club does n’t want to sell , it wo n’t sell , it ’s as simple as that			2
money has never been the objective for the club			2
‘ whatever player — @entity52 or anybody — it would always be on the terms of the club			0
‘ he still has two - and - a - bit years left of his deal so it ’s not something we ’re overly concerned about			2
i ’m confident that at the end of the season we ’ll find the solution			0
’ @entity2 shares a joke with @entity8 striker @entity64 during @entity8 's training session on thursday @entity31 and @entity0 have the money to lure @entity2 should he be allowed to leave @entity67			1
@entity68 understands @entity14 ’s interest is also serious			1
doubts over @entity14 ’s ability to fund a move for @entity73 have seen their interest questioned , but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him			1

however , @entity7 reminded @entity2 that it was @entity8 who made him the player he is today , saying he should be ‘ honoured ’ to represent the club			1
he refused to say whether the player will face disciplinary action after admitting the club had been caught off guard by the interview			0
@entity7 reminded @entity73 it is @entity8 who have made him the player he is today ‘ there was no permission by the club , it was something that surprised us all , ’ added @entity7			1
‘ it ’s part of the modern game			0
people who look after players and represent them have different ways of working			0
i ’ve seen that over the years			0
‘ the last time we sat down it was the intention of the player and his representatives , and also the club , to put ( contract talks ) on hold			0
obviously , @entity52 has come out and made his feelings clear on that and hopefully now the focus will be on the football			0
‘ he ’s a young player who is still learning and developing on and off the field			0
sometimes you make mistakes as a youngster			0
