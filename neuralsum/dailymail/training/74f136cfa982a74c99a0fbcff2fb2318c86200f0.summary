by @entity0 published : 00:59 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 07:56 est , 3 august 2012 an elementary school teacher named as a person of interest in the abduction of a boy in 1989 has said the police investigation violates his rights			1
@entity8 , 56 , has written to state officials to complain about how police have treated him and his family , along with criticizing how the investigation has been handled into the disappearance of @entity14 more than two decades ago			1
@entity14 was 11 when he was abducted on october 22 , 1989 , by a masked gunman at the end of @entity8 's driveway in @entity18 , 80 miles from @entity19 , @entity20			1
the boy has never been found			0
he has been questioned multiple times but his name did n't come out publicly until 2010 , when authorities searched his family farm over two - day period			1
he still lives at the property with his elderly parents who he says have been put under a massive strain by the continual spotlight			0
investigators have examined tens of thousands of leads but there have been no arrests in the case that drew national attention and led to changes in sex offender registration laws			0
this is the first time @entity8 , an elementary school music teacher , has put his complaints in writing			1
when asked why he did so after all this time , he said : ' they are just going to keep me kind of on this lifeline dangling there forever , and i want that to stop			0
' forensic tests on items taken from the 2010 search have yielded no evidence linking them to the crime but investigators were still testing some items			0
@entity8 , who says he is innocent , has not been cleared			2
in the letter , which was sent to 14 departments and agencies , he wrote : ' is it considered legal for law enforcement to give the public the perception i am guilty of something when i 'm not ? never found : @entity14 , 11 , disappeared in 1989 in rural @entity20 but no arrests have ever been made in the case ' to destroy our family 's name the way they did because they had a " @entity77 ! " is in itself , a serious crime			1
nothing can make it right now			0
' the damage has been done			0
but to leave the whole thing open to speculation and open to the public 's imagination is just wrong ! ' in his letter , @entity8 also complained that authorities have not returned his property or listened to details he is offering about what he witnessed the night @entity14 was taken			1
like any unsolved crime , @entity14 and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth			2
letter of @entity8 @entity99 sheriff @entity98 is among a handful of people named in the letter			2
the sheriff said that he had n't seen it but could n't comment regardless because the investigation into the boy 's abduction is still active			0
@entity98 said authorities have put a tremendous amount of resources into solving the case , and added : ' i wo n't be happy until we resolve the case			0
i 'm not satisfied until that happens			0
' authorities have not elaborated on what prompted them to search @entity8 's family farm two years ago , saying only that they had probable cause			1
@entity8 said he mailed the letter on wednesday to 14 different agencies or state officials , including the @entity123 , the @entity20 board of peace officer standards and training , the @entity124 , as well as the @entity99 administrator and senators @entity127 and @entity129 , representative @entity130 and governor @entity126			1
the @entity131 reached out to all 14 people to whom @entity8 sent the letter			2
as of thursday , no one confirmed that the letter had been received			0
@entity8 said if nothing else comes of the complaints he 's lodging , at least he spoke out about what he perceived to be problems with the investigation			2
he wrote : ' like any unsolved crime , @entity14 and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth			1
' @entity14 's mother @entity147 said the family was out of town and had n't seen @entity8 's letter			1
she declined to comment .			0
