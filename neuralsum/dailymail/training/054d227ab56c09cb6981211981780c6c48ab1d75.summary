@entity1 , the brain injury charity , has questioned the application of the @entity4 's regulations over head injuries after @entity6 played on during @entity8 's 2 - 0 @entity4 win over @entity9 on sunday			1
@entity8 goalkeeper @entity6 continued after requiring treatment for a head - knock following a collision with @entity9 forward @entity13 , before being replaced after further treatment and departing @entity15 for precautionary scans in hospital			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity18 said on the charity 's website : ' the new rules introduced this season were designed to ensure no risks to players ' health were taken			2
@entity13 immediately shows concern for @entity6 as the keeper appeared badly hurt ' they clearly state that " if there is any suspicion of the player having sustained a concussion , they must be removed from the field of play , and not allowed to return			1
" ' this incident calls into question whether these rules are working effectively			1
' it is hard to understand how a concussion was not suspected following the sickening clash			0
' @entity6 was taken off only after liquid appeared to be coming from his ear			2
@entity18 acknowledged the difficulty of making an assessment from television , but questioned why a ' safety - first approach ' was not applied			0
@entity6 suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge @entity9 's @entity13 but played on for a while he added : ' bleeding from one or both ears is one of the symptoms to look out for that requires an immediate visit or return to hospital following a head injury			1
' the fact that the bleeding only became apparent 15 minutes after the injury also demonstrates the evolving nature of concussion and highlights why a safety - first approach must be taken with all head injuries			1
' @entity8 's first - team squad were afforded a day off by manager @entity67 as many of the players prepared to join up with their national teams after the @entity71 extended their advantage at the top of the @entity4 to five points from @entity75			1
the @entity76 is escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room only goalkeeper @entity80 , defender @entity81 and striker @entity82 , who is currently nursing an ankle injury , will stay behind for training , with all three having retired from international duty			1
@entity86 leaves for @entity76 duty - for which @entity6 is also expected to depart - on a high after a mixed start to the season			1
the playmaker , who is expected to sign a new contract shortly to commit to @entity8 , was below par against @entity93 , but sparkled on occasion against the @entity95 , particularly in the run which led to the penalty which he converted himself			2
@entity86 , who was the target of some heavy tackling in the contest , is content to be fouled if it benefits the team			0
@entity76 winger @entity86 said he did not mind being fouled if it helped his side win matches and he believes with @entity107 over a set - piece , a goal is always possible			2
' when i get the ball i need to go forward and win free - kicks , win penalties , ' the 23 - year - old @entity86 told @entity114			0
' if they want to play like this it 's not my problem			0
they have two against me , okay , but i can create a lot of space for other players			0
' we can score every game with @entity107 from a free - kick or corner			0
' @entity8 have dropped two points in their opening seven games - in drawing at @entity75 - and are top of their @entity130			2
hazard knows there is no margin for error , though			0
he added : ' we have a strong team			0
we need to concentrate all the time , 100 per cent			0
' we know we have bad moments in one season , but we need to be focused all the time			0
' @entity107 played an key role as he faced his old side @entity9 , providing an assist for the second goal			1
