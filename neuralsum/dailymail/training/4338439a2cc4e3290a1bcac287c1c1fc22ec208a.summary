mr @entity35 is due to tell the @entity42 and @entity43 conference in @entity44 : ' for me it is horrendous that , this @entity3 , a young person experiencing a mental health crisis could easily come across someone in a ' psycho ward ' or ' schizo patient ' costume - complete with handcuffs and ripped restraints - as much as they could see someone in a @entity57 costume			1
' this @entity3 culture is dangerous			0
it conditions all of us to fear mental illness - to see people as ' psychos ' , or ' schizos ' or ' freaks '			1
it makes us believe that mental illness is something other worldly			1
' we have to tackle this damaging stigma which prevents young people from seeking help when they need it , or talking about any problems they might be having			2
' everyone should be able to enjoy @entity3 but i urge all retailers to behave more responsibly - do n't demonise mental illness			1

the petition organiser , @entity90 from @entity91 , wrote : ' this is offensive , stigmatising and extremely damaging not only to public perception of mental illness , but also the people affected by it			1
it 's not right , and it should stop			2
' elsewhere , @entity97 , chief executive of @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , said people would never wear a ' cancer patient ' @entity3 outfit , and so they should not treat mental health issues so flippantly			1

in a blog written after mr @entity35 's criticism last week , @entity10 's @entity112 said the company was disappointed to have been singled out over the ' @entity117 ' outfit which is also on sale on other websites and that it had withdrawn costumes in the past , including one of @entity122			1
he added that the company did not intend to offend people but wanted customers to be able to make a choice themselves , saying : ' we will not be forced into knee - jerk decisions , but are happy to receive constructive criticism			0
' these past days , we have listened to the mental health proponents and made various edits to criticised products			2
this has included renaming product titles , descriptions and category pages to dilute this sensitive area for some			0
' promotions staff and bar tenders at @entity142 were given hazmat - style contamination suits to wear an advert declared that the local area had been ' infected ' by the deadly disease during the themed night in a separate controversy , @entity142 in @entity147 admitted it had made ' a huge error ' by staging an @entity151 - themed @entity150 on wednesday night			0
an advert declared that the local area had been ' infected ' by the deadly disease and that the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) wanted students to go to the bar for ' decontamination and quarantine '			0

@entity180 reported on sunday how websites and bars appeared to be cashing in on the @entity151 crisis by selling costumes for @entity3 , mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers treating those who are infected			0
the costume appeared on the brands on sale website , and a description said : ' as the deadly ebola virus trickles its way through the @entity193 , fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style			0
' elsewhere , @entity104 has also been criticised for selling bloodstained cheerleader and american football player costumes			0
child - sized blue and white cheerleader and american football uniforms featuring bloodstains and extruding bones , muscle and cartilage , ' sure to be scaring everyone at those @entity3 parties ' are being sold on its website and in its stores			0
