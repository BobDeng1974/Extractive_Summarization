car manufacturers have long sought to create incredibly efficient cars to save motorists money and help the environment			1
and now engineers at @entity5 are selling what they claim is the world ’s most fuel efficient production car , which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon			2
the @entity14 ‘ super efficient vehicle ’ features new construction techniques , an innovative futuristic - looking body and hybrid drive - train to dramatically increase fuel economy			1
the car 's fuel efficiency of 313 miles per gallon compares favourably with @entity27 's @entity26 , which typically does 44mpg in city driving conditions and @entity31 's @entity30 , which does 31mpg on average			0
in theory , it could be driven from the centre of @entity36 to the outskirts of @entity38 in a straight line , using just one gallon of fuel			0
the @entity14 was designed from scratch and is lightweight as some steel components , including the chassis , have been replaced by carbon fibre so that the car weighs in at just 795kg			2
the @entity14 ' super efficient vehicle ' features new construction techniques , an innovative futuristic - looking body and hybrid drive - train to dramatically increase fuel economy the car can do 313 miles per gallon			1
it combines new construction techniques , a super aerodynamic design and a hybrid - drive train to be so fuel efficient			1
the two - seat diesel - electric hybrid car emits 24 g / km of carbon dioxide			1
it weighs in at just 795kg and has ' scissor doors ' it measures almost four metres long , 1.7metres wide and just 1.2metres tall			0
it is powered by a compact 800 cc two - cylinder diesel engine and together with the @entity61 electric motor			0
in pure electric mode , the @entity14 can travel up to 35km before the diesel engine cuts in			0
the car can go from 0 - 60mph in 11.9 seconds and has an electronically limited top speed of 99mph just 200 of the cars are on sale and cost € 111,000 ( £ 92,490 ) as they are hand crafted			1
the edgy design is intended to reduce drag and it features ‘ scissor doors ’ which were famously featured in the @entity73 , used in the @entity75 films			0
to achieve the target fuel consumption figure the @entity14 was aerodynamically optimised , adopting a classic ‘ tear drop ’ shape and using innovations such as removing traditional wing mirrors and replacing them with small cameras called e-mirrors , which transmit exterior images to interior displays			2
@entity5 ’s car measures almost four metres long and 1.7metres wide , making it similar in size to the @entity88 , yet it is just 1.2metres tall , making it a similar height to a @entity90			2
it is powered by a compact 800 cc two - cylinder diesel engine and together with the @entity61 electric motor , it car can travel over 600 miles on a single tank of fuel			0
the two - seat diesel - electric hybrid car emits 24 g / km of carbon dioxide , which the @entity21 auto manufacturer says sets a new benchmark for vehicle efficiency the @entity14 was designed from scratch and is lightweight as some steel components ( an exploded view is pictured ) , including the chassis , have been replaced by carbon fibre so that the car weighs in at just 795kg the model gets its name from the car ’s @entity109 fuel efficiency rating and was originally designed to use less than one litre of fuel per 100km – the equivalent of 282mpg – although it now exceeds this			1
in pure electric mode , the @entity14 can travel up to 35km before the diesel engine cuts in			0
the car can go from 0 - 60mph in 11.9 seconds and its electronically limited top speed is 99 mph			0
the @entity14 's edgy design is intended to reduce drag and it features ' scissor doors ' ( pictured ) famously featured in the @entity73 , which was used in the @entity75 films to achieve the target fuel consumption figure the @entity14 was aerodynamically optimised , adopting a classic ' tear drop ' shape and using innovations such as removing traditional wing mirrors and replacing them with small cameras called @entity82 ( pictured ) , which transmit exterior images to interior displays the @entity14 is manufactured - in left - hand drive only - at @entity5 ’s @entity132 factory in @entity21 , which also produces the @entity133 and @entity134			1
unlike these cars , the @entity14 is ‘ handcrafted ’ using small series production processes and is being sold in @entity21 for € 111,000 ( £ 92,490 )			1
around a dozen vehicles to be made available to @entity139 customers , @entity5 told @entity140			0
only 250 of the @entity14 cars been made , with a total of 200,000 available for sale , as 50 of the vehicles were pre-production models			2
the @entity14 is ' handcrafted ' using small series production processes and is being sold in @entity21 for ¿ 111,000 ( £ 92,490 ) but customers will have a say in the car 's interior , pictured			1

engineers in @entity21 used new construction techniques and a hybrid drive - train to create the lightweight , fuel efficient car
@entity14 emits 24 g / km of carbon dioxide and is as large as a @entity88 but as low and streamlined as a @entity90
only 250 of the cars have been made , they are being sold for € 111,000 ( £ 92,490 ) - and there is no right - hand - drive *version* available
