by @entity0 panicking tube workers fled in all directions to buy sugar so they could stop quick - drying cement setting after it was mistakenly poured into an underground station control room , it emerged today			1
contractors were seen pouring bag after bag into the sludge when vital signalling equipment was submerged in a ' f * * * up of major proportions ' , staff have said			1
cement meant for new foundations of a £ 700million upgrade at @entity18 had leaked into a control room , and a large amount of sugar , which is a ' cement destroyer ' , was needed to stop it becoming solid			1
hundreds of thousands of commuters were left stranded when @entity24 services from @entity25 to @entity26 were suspended yesterday afternoon , but after working through the night it opened again this morning			1
chaos : the @entity24 was shut after a signal control room was flooded with cement , so worker rushed to find sugar to stop it setting stranded : the leak onto signalling equipment caused the @entity24 to close at around 2pm between @entity26 and @entity25 - it only reopened this morning error : the cement was meant for some foundations , but spread into a control room causing panic among staff aside from the obvious mistake , @entity41 was further criticised after they initially put the line closure down to flooding , but they said today there had been ' confusion ' about what happened			1
an insider said the catastrophe left workers knee - deep in concrete desperately trying to stop expensive signalling equipment being destroyed			2
' the only word for it is a f * * * up of major proportions			1
everyone was f - ing and blinding when they realised what had happened , ' an insider told the @entity62			1
' it was knee - deep in the signal room swamping all the relay equipment and it ’s going to be very , very expensive to repair because it was all brand new			0
' @entity67 is used by builders to keep cement liquid because it interferes with the binding process			0
cement hardens when it hydrates , but sugar molecules delay the chemical reaction			2
' when they realised what had happened they went out and bought bags of sugar and threw it on , ' the same source said			2
' @entity41 were telling people the reason for the closure was flooding , because technically it was			0
they just did n’t say it was flooded with concrete			0
they did n’t want people to know what a c * * * - up it was '			1
anger : passengers were initially told the closure was due to ' flooding ' at @entity18 , but @entity41 said this was down to ' confusion ' when water is added to cement and mixed , it will set and harden			2
to slow or stop the process sugar is widely used and is known as a ' cement destroyer '			1
small amounts of sugar - around 1 to 100 parts cement - will delay the onset of it becoming hard , but much larger proportions will stop the process completely			1
but it must be done quickly , otherwise there will be no stopping the process			0
the calamity on the @entity24 left tens of thousand of rush hour commuters searching for an alternative way to get home last night , with police used to control crowds			0
a spokesman for @entity41 said this morning the problem has been resolved and was now operating a good service			0
@entity121 , @entity122 's operations director , said contractors had been working on the new station in an area next to the @entity18 line signal control room			2
' these works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room , damaging equipment , ' he said			0
pictures were posted on the @entity135 website showed a thick layer of cement in the affected room			0
a spokesman for the @entity141 union said yesterday : ' we understand that a foot of concrete burst into the control room , having been poured into an escalator void			0
' we await further information but what we do know is that @entity122 technicians are on site now , working flat out to clear up the mess and get services back on line , proving once again that it 's directly - employed public sector staff who are needed to deal with this kind of emergency , making a nonsense of @entity160 's tube staff cuts plans			0

the leak at @entity18 closed @entity24 between @entity26 and @entity25
workers ran for sugar and poured it in - because it is a ' cement destroyer '
' the only word for it is a f * * * up of major proportions . everyone was f - ing and blinding when they realised what had happened ' , an insider said
the line section was shut from 2pm yesterday but opened this morning
