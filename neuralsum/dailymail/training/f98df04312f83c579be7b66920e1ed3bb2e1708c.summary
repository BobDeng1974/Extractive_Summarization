they moved to the city with dreams of making it big			1
but for countryside - bred migrants , life in @entity5 is not cheap			1
the answer ? go underground			0
welcome to the so - called @entity8 : the one million people that have made a home out of bunkers below the surface of @entity14 's second - biggest city			1
the structures were erected in 1969 under chairman @entity26 's rule during the @entity27			1
fearing an imminent @entity30 attack , cities were ordered to prepare safety measures			1
around 20,000 bomb shelters were dug			1
when @entity26 died and @entity42 came to the fore , such defensive tactics were sidelined - leaving the city with a pointless network of caves			1
unsurprisingly , hundreds of entrepreneurial landlords descended on the bunkers , letting out rooms as hostels			2
by the mid- 90s , the government latched on to the scheme and many of the rooms are now part of a for - profit housing system			2
an alternative : twenty - five - year - old @entity57 and her three - year - old daughter , @entity59 , enjoy a game on their computer in one of the largest rooms in this basement in west @entity5 , @entity14			2
the units were built in 1969 under chairman @entity26 who feared a @entity30 attack bar waitress @entity69 , 24 , and 23 - year - old office worker @entity70 have lived here for one and a half years to avoid sky - high rental prices when @entity26 died and @entity42 came to the fore , such defensive tactics were sidelined - leaving the city with a pointless network of caves located near the deserts of the north east , the network is also a welcome environment for all seasons : cool in summer , warm in winter it means people like @entity84 , an aspiring actor from @entity85 , can support themselves and pursue their dreams			1
his parents implored him to take a job as a policeman back at home where he could be comfortable			0
in a short film by artist @entity93 that explores the subterranean network , he explained : ' when my father came to visit me he cried when he saw where i lived			2
he said , " son , this wo nâ€™t do			0
" ' ' but i told him : " when i go out and meet people i always look very presentable			0
who 's going to be able to tell that i live in a basement ? " ' other dwellers include @entity107 , a 50 - year - old woman from the coal - mining town of @entity110 , who moved to @entity5 to be near her sons after farming proved unprofitable			1
making ends meet : @entity114 , 23 , tries on a borrowed suit and tie for size the night before an examination to become an insurance salesman melon seeds and instant noodles are splattered all over the floor in his room , but @entity123 , 24 in purple , originally from @entity125 , is just having a smoke and playing a computer game			0
for him , all the matters is making ends meet in @entity5 , @entity14 's second - biggest city uncertain future ? a question mark hangs over their future as officials in 2010 announced a crackdown on health and safety in the city @entity140 moved to the bunkers after graduating from high school in @entity144 province to pursue a career as an artist			1
@entity147 , from @entity5 suburb @entity148 , wants to be a fly fishing official , but currently works as a car mechanic , and lives in the bunkers to save money			1
and an entire family - @entity156 , her 17 - year - old son @entity154 , and her husband @entity155 - have opted for a simpler life			0
located near the deserts of the north east , the underground network is also a welcome environment for all seasons : cool in summer , warm in winter			0
though most of the inhabitants foresee a move on to bigger and better things - above ground - the vast majority are content and grateful			0
@entity167 , originally from @entity168 , used to live in a more central location within @entity5 's @entity170 , but one year ago the house was torn down			2
he says : ' everybody thinks that living in the basement is only a temporary thing but then people end up staying much longer ' something of a family home for this couple : @entity179 , 27 , and her husband have moved underground for lack of funds			2
they have left their 5 - year - old son with her parents back in their native @entity188 in eastern @entity14 however , a question mark hangs over their future as officials in 2010 announced a crackdown on health and safety in the city			0
and the native citizens see the @entity8 as unwelcome intruders			0
but despite city plans to wipe out the system by 2012 , it provides a convenient answer to the question of affordable housing			0
for now , the future is uncertain .			0

chairman @entity26 built network of 20,000 bunkers under @entity5 fearing @entity30 attack in 1969
strategy was abandoned when @entity42 took over , hundreds of *squatters* took over the shelters
by the 90s , the government started leasing out the tiny subterranean units as cheap *apartments*
it is now home to around one million poor migrants who have moved to @entity5 to realize their dreams
