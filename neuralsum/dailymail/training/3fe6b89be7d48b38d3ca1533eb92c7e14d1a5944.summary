free : @entity9 , 72 , was released from jail on thursday after spending 21 years behind bars for child abuse which he claimed he never committed			1
his ex-wife was released from her charges last week the only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse			1
but in court documents filed earlier this year , dr. @entity33 says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology			0
that prompted prosecutors in @entity40 , which includes @entity19 , to agree that the case 's evidence was faulty and release the couple on bond			0
freed : @entity45 , 63 , pictured , was released on bond on november 26 the couple , who have always maintained their innocence , hope that appeals courts will now exonerate them			1

the pair - who divorced while in prison , but who remain close - hugged warmly			0
@entity9 told reporters he was n't bitter and planned to spend his first moments of freedom grabbing a cheeseburger			0
dr @entity33 said in an affidavit presented to court this year that he had little training at the time on how to examine sexual abuse in children and came to the wrong conclusions in examining a child in the @entity9 case			2
' while my testimony was based on a good faith belief at that time , i now realize my conclusion is not scientifically or medically valid , and that i was mistaken , ' he said in the affidavit			0
the @entity13 were convicted of sexually abusing a 3 - year - old girl in their care and faced accusations of dismembering corpses , putting blood in @entity80 and flying children to @entity82 where they would be sexually abused by soldiers			1
@entity33 provided the only physical evidence in the case , telling the jury that lacerations on one of the alleged victims was indication of sexual abuse			2
he later learned that those slight lacerations were actually normal physiology			0
' there is a reasonable likelihood that ( the medical expert 's ) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated @entity45 's right to a fair trial , ' said @entity101 , the district attorney for @entity40 , which is located in central @entity102 and includes the city of @entity19			0
day care center : here is the home and former day care center owned and run by @entity9 , who was swept up in a national hysteria over satanic ritual abuse @entity9 's attorney , @entity110 , said : ' the case was a true witch hunt because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a wide satanic conspiracy			1
' he said the therapist 's techniques — which were used to convince the children , parents and investigators that the @entity121 committed human sacrifices , sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked			2

the couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who were accused of being part of a group of @entity134 worshipers who engaged in ritual child abuse across @entity136 during the 1980s and 1990s			1
free : the couple have always maintained their innocence and even the children who initially claimed the couple sexually abused them and served them blood - laced kool - aid have retracted their testimony ' the @entity9 case is definitely about the panic back then , ' said @entity110			1
between 1984 to 1989 , some 100 people nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial , according to @entity150 of the @entity151 , which works to free those wrongly imprisoned			0
many have since questioned a number of the cases , which they said were based on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of sexual abuse .			0

@entity45 and @entity9 were sentenced to 48 years in prison each in 1992 for alleged child abuse at a day care they ran out of their home
@entity170 initially claimed they were sexually abused with pens and flown to @entity82 where the @entity13 watched as soldiers abused them
there was only one piece of physical evidence which the doctor later retracted , and the children said that they were *pressured* to lie
@entity9 was freed on november 26 and @entity9 was released thursday
their case came amid a wave of fear about satanic rituals at day cares in the late 1980s and 1990s across @entity136
