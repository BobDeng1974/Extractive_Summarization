by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 3 may 2013 a man bit a dog to stop it attacking his wife after the animal tore off her nose in a vicious attack			1
@entity8 came to the defense of his wife @entity10 after the 50 - pound labrador retriever mix launched at her as they enjoyed a stroll with their pet beagle in @entity16 , @entity17 on sunday			1
the black - and - white animal , which had bounded out from a nearby yard , sunk its teeth into the woman 's right thigh , before biting her stomach and going for her face			1
she recalled how it scratched at her eyes and broke her sunglasses - which she believes saves her sight - before clamping down on her nose and ripping it from her face			2
mr @entity8 lunged for the dogs and tried to pry the @entity43 's jaws open so that it would drop the beagle , and the dog bit mr @entity8 's arm			1
again , it would not let go			0
in a bizarre move , mr @entity8 then bit down on the dog 's nose - forcing the animal to release its jaws , the couple told the @entity54			1
the @entity55 jumped in their truck and drove to @entity57 in @entity54			0
mr @entity8 suffered a dog bite to his arm , which became infected , and received treatment			1
quick thinking : after the out - of - control dog tore off mrs @entity64 's nose , it started attacking the couple 's own dog and mr @entity8 had to bite the animal on its nose so that it would stop recovering : @entity64 has undergone one surgery but will need many more to rebuild her nose but there 's a longer road ahead for his wife , who has already undergone one surgery			1
doctors will use skin from her forehead and elsewhere and cartilage from her ear to rebuild her nose			1
' we took pictures at the hospital , and it was the most grotesque things i 've ever seen , ' the family 's attorney @entity80 told the @entity54			0
' there 's just a hole where a nose should be			2
' but speaking from her hospital bed , mrs @entity64 managed to stay upbeat			1
' it could have been so much worse , ' she said			0
' if i had n't been wearing my sunglasses , i 'm sure i would be missing an eye			0
if it had gotten hold of my throat , i 'd be dead			0
' attacked : the couple had been walking with their beagle , pictured , when the other dog attacked visitor : their pet , who was not badly injured in the attack , visited his owners in hospital , pictured the @entity55 ' dog recovered from the attack and has even visited his owners in hospital			2
but the other dog is under quarantine as authorities try to determine who is responsible for it			2
the county does not have a vicious dog ordinance that would seek charges for the dog 's owner and potentially lead to the animal being put down , the @entity54 reported			2
the animal will be under quarantine for six weeks and then released to its owner			0
it is currently staying at the home from where it was seen running			0
unprovoked attack : the labrador retriever mix is now in quarantine but will not be put down ( file picture ) the man looking after the animal , @entity133 , said it belongs to a local homeless man , @entity136 , but said he occasionally takes the dog in to feed him			1
he claimed that the dog does not stay with him on a regular basis , which neighbors disputed			0
the @entity141 said they had a lucky escape and fear what the threat the animal poses			0
' i just ca n't imagine if this dog had gotten ahold of a little kid , ' mrs @entity64 said			1
' it 's just scary that this dog is on the loose			0
' see below for video			0
