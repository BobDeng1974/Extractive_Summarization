@entity1 supremo @entity0 will discover later on tuesday whether a settlement offer to end his bribery trial has been accepted			1
the 83 - year - old has proposed a staggering sum of 100 million dollars ( £ 60million ) to bring an end to a case that commenced in april in a district court in @entity9			1
that figure has been accepted by the state prosecutors , and is now being considered by the presiding judge @entity12			0
deal on table : @entity1 boss @entity0 arrives with his wife @entity14 ( seated left ) for his trial in @entity9 , where prosecutors have offered to drop bribery charges against him in exchange for £ 60million in @entity21 , certain criminal trials can be concluded if all parties agree to a settlement			1
in @entity0 's case , the prosecutors have accepted a proposed £ 60million , and it is now left to presiding judge @entity27			2
such an arrangement does not imply any guilt on behalf of the accused			0
@entity0 said : ' we do n't know anything yet			0
' the judge is going to come out at one o'clock			0
they have n't made up their mind what they want to do , to be honest with you			0
' it 's going to take them a few hours to look at this and decide what they want to do , so we wait and see			0
' over the past few months @entity0 has been defending himself against charges of bribery of a @entity21 banker , and incitement to breach of trust			1
in 2006 , @entity21 regional bank @entity49 sold their 47.2 per cent stake in @entity1 to private equity firm , and the current majority shareholders , @entity53			2
prosecutors claim @entity0 paid @entity55 , formerly the chief risk officer of @entity49 , a bribe of 44million @entity57 dollars ( £ 26million ) to steer the sale to @entity53			0
deliberations : @entity1 boss @entity0 talks to his lawyer @entity60 in the @entity9 courtroom @entity62 comes face - to - face with accuser @entity0 has long maintained his innocence , claiming he was ' shaken down ' by @entity55 who was threatening to inform @entity65 he controlled an offshore family trust known as @entity0			1
although @entity0 has continually insisted the trust is not in his name , if an investigation had uncovered to the contrary he would have been liable for a tax bill of around £ 2billion			0
with the trial running for just over three months , last tuesday it was halted after @entity0 offered to pay a sum of money , believed at that stage to be 25million euros ( £ 20million ) in return for the charges being dropped			1
under @entity82 state law , a trial of the nature of @entity0 's can be concluded if the accused makes a payment to a non-profit making organisation , or the treasury			1
presiding over the case : judge @entity12 ( centre ) arrives for another session of the trial of the @entity1 boss such an offer , however , does not imply any guilt on behalf of the accused			2
@entity0 's lawyers made the offer believing the state prosecution team 's case to be , in their words , ' highly questionable ' , and with the trial proving to be ' extremely burdensome ' on their client			2
over the past few days negotiations have swayed back and forth , and understood to have resulted in the 100million euro offer			0
@entity0 has continued to run @entity1 either side of attending court for two days a week , which would have concluded in october had it run its full course			1
his future as head of @entity1 hinged on the outcome of the trial as he had previously been warned a guilty verdict , regardless of whether he avoided a prison sentence , would have resulted in his dismissal as chief executive			2

@entity9 state court to decide whether to *approve* the deal later today
had last week offered £ 20m to settle case where he faces ten years in jail
@entity0 accused of paying @entity21 banker to continue his grip on @entity1
he went on trial in april and has *pleaded* not guilty to the charges
