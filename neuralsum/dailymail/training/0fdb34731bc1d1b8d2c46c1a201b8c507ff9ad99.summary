sir @entity0 said ' good ' schools will receive more frequent check - ups to stop them from slipping back into mediocrity the head of @entity5 yesterday demanded ‘ slightly maverick ’ head teachers who ‘ are n’t afraid to ruffle feathers ’ as part of a major clampdown on coasting schools			1
sir @entity0 insisted there was ‘ no room for complacency ’ amid ‘ worrying signs ’ that standards in secondary schools are ‘ stagnating ’			1
he revealed that ‘ good ’ schools will receive shorter and more frequent check - ups in future as part of a major shake - up of inspections in @entity22			1
this will help ensure they do n’t ‘ slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity ’			2
up to 60 per cent of @entity22 ’s schools will undergo ‘ light touch ’ visits from inspectors every two to three years to stamp out potential coasting			1
at present , these ‘ good ’ schools undergo full inspections every five to six years			1
the proposals , to come into effect from next september , will be published by the education watchdog for consultation today			0
the shake - up will also enable inspectors to spend more time helping drive up standards in under performing schools			2
sir @entity0 told the @entity43 conference yesterday that the introduction of a ‘ requires improvement ’ grade to replace ‘ satisfactory ’ has had a ‘ galvanising effect ’ on schools			1
he said : ‘ coasting schools now know that mediocre standards will no longer be tolerated			2
‘ but i am the first to recognise that @entity5 needs to move towards a more proportionate , risk - based model for inspection which focuses on those struggling institutions that need a greater level of scrutiny and intervention			0
‘ at the same time , we need to move to a new inspection model which keeps a more watchful eye on good schools so that they do n’t slip back but continue to improve			1
‘ that is why , when we launch our consultation , i will be suggesting frequent but shorter inspections of good schools led by @entity5 , with a much greater emphasis on professional dialogue			1
’ sir @entity0 insisted that if the country genuinely aspires to a ‘ world - class ’ label for education ‘ then we simply can not afford to take our foot off the gas ’			1
‘ it ’s imperative that we continue to up our game as a nation if we ’re to have any chance of competing economically and , just as importantly , if we are going to build a more cohesive society , ’ he said			0
‘ firstly , we must ensure the improvements of recent years are maintained and that the system does not slip back into an acceptance of mediocrity			0
this is a key driver for the reforms will be will be consulting on this autumn			0
’ sir @entity0 said the government was ‘ very much looking to ambitious , buccaneering , go - getting school leaders to make the running in school improvement in 2014 ’			1
‘ leaders who show a scornful intolerance towards the type of mediocrity that still characterises too much of our education system - and which until recently was dressed up in the euphemism of ‘ satisfactory ’ , ’ he said			2
sir @entity0 added that scrapping the ' satisfactory ' grading for schools , and replacing it with ' needing improvement ' had a ' galvanising ' effect on standards ‘ it very much chimes with my own conviction that the future of education in this country depends on these energetic , dynamic , entrepreneurial , and perhaps slightly maverick leaders who thrive on competition and are n’t afraid to ruffle feathers			1
’ meanwhile , @entity5 ’s plans for future inspections are also likely to include proposals for more no - notice visits			0
last month it was announced that @entity5 inspectors had been sent to dozens of schools across @entity22 to conduct snap inspections under the watchdog ’s existing powers , amid serious concerns about standards			2
schools usually get half a day ’s notice of an inspection			0
but @entity122 , general secretary of the @entity123 , yesterday warned that sweeping reform of @entity5 was needed			0
he said : ‘ schools can no longer learn effectively from its ( @entity5 ’s ) adversarial approach			0
‘ the current model of inspection has reached the end of its useful life and now holds the education system back			0
’ he added : ‘ the current trend of no - notice inspections has to stop			0
‘ head teachers have a right and a need to be present during inspection and a small amount of notice is required to make this possible			0

sir @entity0 revealed ' good ' schools will have *regular* ' light touch ' inspections
@entity148 country can not take ' foot of the gas ' in *pursuit* of world class schools
new checks and scrapping of ' satisfactory ' rating to drive out mediocrity
