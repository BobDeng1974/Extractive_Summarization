prices at petrol pumps across the @entity2 are rising so quickly that television reporters are struggling to keep up			0
footage of @entity6 ' @entity5 reporting from a @entity8 forecourt has gone viral after each of the three grades of fuel rose 10 cents before viewers ' eyes			1
' it 's almost too unbelievable to believe , ' she said during her live report for @entity18 's @entity17			1
' it was $ 4.99			0
now , it â€™s $ 5.09 for a gallon of regular gas here at this station in downtown @entity38			0
' some sceptics believe the extraordinary rise in the cost came because of a deal between the tv crew and the station owner			2
they agreed to rise the price at that time , they claim , to further highlight the problem of spiralling fuel costs			2
but that has been denied by @entity6			1
the real - time rise came at the start of a live report into the escalating cost of fuel in the @entity2 the station sign , at the beginning of the video , clearly showed fuel prices stood at $ 4.99 a gallon for regular , $ 5.09 a gallon for plus and $ 5.19 a gallon for super premium			1
claims : @entity6 has denied speculation it asked the station 's owners to change the prices when they were live on air but as @entity5 spoke to the camera , the sign in the background can be clearly seen blinking as an employee altered the digits			1
the news report then cut to pre-recorded interviews with struggling motorists in states across the country			2
and when the camera returned to the live spot two minutes later , the sign behind @entity5 read $ 5.09 , $ 5.19 and $ 5.29			2
a stunned @entity18 could not believe her eyes , and warned drivers not to ' blink at the gasoline station '			0
broadcasting of the rise could not have come at a worse time for president @entity89 , who is seeking to confront rising public anxiety about soaring prices			1
worry : president @entity89 is facing rising fuel prices they are threatening to undercut his re-election prospects and offer @entity95 an easy target			1
@entity89 was seeking to rev up his supporters as he hauled in campaign cash yesterday in the important battleground state of @entity100 , which he may need to capture to hold the @entity101 in november			1
he accused his @entity95 presidential rivals of peddling a philosophy that is " wrong about @entity2 , " casting them as protectors of the wealthy who would leave everyone else to fend for themselves			0
@entity89 assailed @entity95 for offering what he described as flawed and dishonest plans to lower gasoline prices			1
he said dismissively that all the @entity95 can talk about is more drilling - ' a bumper sticker ... a strategy to get politicians through an election ' - when @entity2 's energy challenges demand much more			0
in a speech in @entity117 , he promoted the expansion of domestic oil and gas exploration but also the development of new forms of energy			0
for all the political claims , economists say there is not much a president of either party can do about gasoline prices in the short term			0
but it is clear that people are concerned - a new @entity134 - @entity133 poll said seven in 10 find the issue deeply important - so it is sure to be a political issue through the summer			1
@entity89 aides worry that the rise in prices could reverse the country 's economic gains and the president 's improved political standing			2
the poll shows that though @entity89 's approval rating on the economy has climbed , 58 percent disapprove of what he 's doing on gas prices			1
@entity89 insisted there are no short - term solutions to high gas prices , and that anyone suggesting otherwise was not being honest			1
still , he sought to offer something to anxious voters by saying he had ordered his administration to search for every possible area to help consumers in the coming months			0
he sought to take credit for rising oil and natural gas production , a greater mix of energy sources and decreased consumption			0
he promoted an energy strategy that the administration says will reduce dependence on foreign oil in the long term			0
@entity89 said that despite political criticism of his policies ' @entity2 is producing more oil today than at any time in the last eight years '			2
he also noted that , for the first time in 30 years , the @entity2 is now exporting more petroleum products than it imports .			0
