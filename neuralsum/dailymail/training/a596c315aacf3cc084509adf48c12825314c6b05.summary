rail minister @entity0 has attacked the ' goodies ' being offered to @entity2 to keep it in the @entity4 two - thirds of @entity7 mps want generous subsidies to @entity2 to be axed if the country voted to stay in the @entity10			1
@entity11 sparked fury among @entity14 mps this week by pledging to keep the controversial @entity16 formula , as part of a desperate bid to persuade @entity2 to vote no to independence			1
even his ministers were last night in open revolt over the issue , with transport minister @entity0 warning the prime minister to stop handing out ‘ financial party bags ’ to @entity24			1
the formula , which has been the source of resentment for years , means that public spending per head is £ 1,623 a year higher in @entity2 than in @entity7			2
a poll last night revealed that 63 per cent of @entity7 mps now want to axe the formula			2
the survey , by @entity33 , found this included 83 per cent of conservatives , 41 per cent of @entity6 and 78 per cent of @entity36			2
mrs @entity0 broke cover before the polls in @entity2 had even closed to warn against handing ‘ goodies ’ to @entity39 without also introducing a fairer deal for @entity7			1
she added : ‘ if the result is a narrow no , this will be a running sore in politics for years to come with demands from @entity53 every few years for another go at the question			0
' if there is a proposal to allow devolution of local taxation , as well maintaining the current level of funding as a dollop from the @entity10 @entity45 , then that can hardly be equitable for those of us in all other areas in the @entity67			1
’ the @entity68 and the @entity4 flag were held aloft on @entity70 in @entity39 this morning ahead of the referendum today defence minister @entity72 also acknowledged yesterday that greater devolution to @entity2 ‘ will cause controversy in @entity74 and @entity7 ’			1
many mps believe mr @entity11 made a mistake by agreeing to keep the @entity16 formula under pressure from @entity80			0
they are also pressing for @entity2 mps to be barred from voting on @entity7 matters , particularly if @entity2 is handed new powers over tax and benefits			1
@entity14 mp @entity86 said mr @entity11 ’s policy to offer @entity2 devo max was ‘ not thought through , and is concerning many of my constituents who feel it is unfair ’			1
@entity11 , @entity92 and @entity93 signed a joint declaration promising to devolve more powers to @entity2 in the event of a ' no ' vote @entity98 , chairman of the powerful @entity99 of backbench @entity81 , said neither the party nor the public would accept a devolution deal that fails to address @entity7 concerns			1
he said : ‘ the devolution settlement introduced by @entity106 was unbalanced and created two different classes of mp			0
‘ that should have been corrected already in the interest of democracy and fairness			0
’ government sources insist mr @entity11 is ‘ very aware ’ of the anger over the so - called ‘ @entity7 question ’			0
he is expected to come forward with proposals to curb the voting rights of @entity2 mps as part of any new devolution settlement			0
but several @entity81 warned that they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to @entity2 unless the @entity16 formula is also scrapped			2
@entity14 mp @entity122 said : ‘ the party leaders do n’t have the authority to make a bribe on behalf of the people of the @entity10			0
‘ taxation is an issue for @entity45			1
we do n’t legislate by presidential - style decree			0
’ @entity92 was last night facing criticism over his shambolic no campaign , amid reports that 30 per cent of @entity106 supporters are poised to vote yes – up from 18 per cent last month			0
the @entity106 leader spent the final week of the campaign touring @entity2			2
but he was escorted to safety this week after being jostled by @entity139 supporters during a trip to an @entity39 shopping centre			1
he then pulled out of two events on the closing day of campaigning			0
and mr @entity92 ’s poor personal ratings in @entity2 mirror his ratings in @entity7 , despite low levels of @entity2 support for the conservatives			0
@entity150 , the former first minister of @entity2 , said the no campaign led by the @entity106 leader had been negative and disorganised , adding : ‘ if it is a no vote , @entity80 will have been largely responsible for that			2
if it ’s a yes then there will be a lot of questions			0

@entity0 attacks the ' financial goody bags ' on offer to @entity39
transport minister said last ditch offers of more powers was ' *appeasement* '
says it is not fair to offer ' raft of goodies paid for by us south of the border '
she expects @entity45 to be recalled next week to *discuss* referendum
