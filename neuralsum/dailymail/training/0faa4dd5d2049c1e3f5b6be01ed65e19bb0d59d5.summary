a frisson of pain suddenly broke out on @entity3 ’s face after he slipped on the worn baseline and crumpled on the hard turf of @entity6			1
his left shoulder had landed smack on the ground and , for a few moments in the third set , his progress in the tournament was potentially in jeopardy			1
he lay on the floor , his painful joint being manipulated by healing hands			2
making light of the trouble , he closed out the match to maintain a remarkable record : he will now play his 21st consecutive @entity22 fourth round and his sixth successively at @entity23 , against @entity24			2
‘ i had a strong impact			2
when i stood up , i felt a click or pop. i feared it might be dislocated or a joint problem			2
‘ going out in that way would be the worst possible exit			2
but luckily it had a minor effect on the joint and the muscle around it			2
i had ultrasound but it ’s all looking good			2
’ @entity49 was not the story of @entity3 ’s performance on friday			1
no sooner had he broken his @entity53 opponent @entity31 ’s erratic serve than he would be broken back			1
yes , @entity31 was pesky but @entity3 was undone as much by his own shifts of mood			1
the @entity56 lost service games in all three sets and more than once threw his arms wide in disbelief and whacked loose balls high into the sky in exasperation			1
the world no 2 has not won a @entity22 since last year ’s @entity65 and he will need to develop as the fortnight continues if he is to add a seventh major title to his cv			0
in pain : @entity3 clutches his left shoulder after taking nasty tumble during his match with @entity31 treatment : @entity3 's shoulder was tended to before he resumed to complete his victory ‘ there are things in my game i would like to improve in a few days and see if i can do better in the next match , ’ he said			1
‘ but , for now , everything is going in the right direction and i hope that i will elevate my game as the tournament progresses			0
if i do n’t do that , i ’ll find myself in a very difficult position			0
’ there were a few faux - amusing moments			0
a male voice from the crowd shouted : ‘ i love you @entity3			1
’ @entity3 put his thumb up			1
one doubts @entity3 ’s girlfriend @entity91 was worried			1
when , a little while later , someone — perhaps the same humourist — shouted ; ‘ i love you @entity96 , ’ the remark fell flat			0
smash : @entity3 hits an overhead shot on his way to beating @entity53 @entity31 relief : @entity3 celebrates after coming through a tough third - round match against @entity31 the @entity96 in question was of course his coach @entity96 , the three - time @entity23 champion who sat impassively in the box until @entity3 won and turned towards his supporting cast			1
@entity3 clenched his fist ; @entity96 clapped his hands			1
‘ i talked with @entity96 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ we obviously need to work on my diving volleys , learning how to fall down on the court			0
i ’m not very skilful in that			0
’ he was smiling as he said it			0
‘ where he helps me the most and where i feel the biggest change is from a mental point of view , ’ he added			0
‘ obviously it is going to take a little time for us to find the perfect balance and for the work to be reflected on court with results			0
no reply : @entity31 had his chances against @entity124 but could n't take advantage ‘ but we already have a couple of titles together			1
we have the final of the @entity65			0
it ’s already starting to build up			0
i am starting to feel the effect of his advice and his presence			0
’ @entity3 at least has two clear days before playing @entity24 , the 29 - year - old @entity53 who was his semi-final victim in 2011			1
what does he expect ? ‘ i do n’t fear anything , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i expect him to serve well			0
coming to the net , he ’s a very aggressive player			0
if he feels good on the day , he can beat anybody			0

no 1 seed @entity3 into last *16* after win over @entity31
@entity56 took a nasty tumble in the third set and hurt his left shoulder
recovered to see off his @entity53 opponent
@entity3 is *confident* there is no *damage*
