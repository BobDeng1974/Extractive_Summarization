by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:34 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 10 july 2013 criticism : @entity3 unveiling his reforms yesterday @entity3 ’s reform of @entity7 ’s trade union links was denounced as a ‘ complete sham ’ last night after it emerged it could leave union barons even richer and more powerful			1
the @entity7 leader yesterday unveiled what he billed as ‘ big and historic changes ’ to the way union members give money to his party			1
mr @entity3 ’s proposal to end the automatic affiliation of union members to the party could cost it part of its income , with some commentators suggesting that as much as £ 5million of the £ 9million is at stake			2
@entity26 hailed the move as ‘ a real act of leadership ’			2
the former prime minister admitted he probably should have taken the same step when he led the party from 1994 to 2007			1
the explosive reaction expected from the unions did not materialise , as @entity36 general secretary @entity35 said he was ‘ very comfortable ’ with the proposals – which he said could in fact result in tens of thousands more union members joining @entity7			1
in addition , the man mr @entity3 put in charge of the reforms , former @entity7 general secretary @entity44 , actually helped set up @entity36			1
denouncing the plans , @entity46 chairman @entity45 said : ‘ these reforms are a complete sham and no more than a tactical distraction			2
they do nothing to deal with the scandal around @entity54 or the fact that @entity36 has fixed the selection of 41 candidates in key marginal seats			2
‘ no wonder @entity35 has been smiling			1
the only result of these reforms are they will increase the coffers of @entity36 and his spending power			0
’ the measures are designed to draw a line under the biggest crisis of mr @entity3 ’s leadership , as police probe claims that @entity36 tried to fix the selection of @entity7 ’s general election candidate in @entity54 by packing the constituency with 100 or more of its own members			1
in a @entity76 speech , mr @entity3 said @entity54 represented ‘ part of the death - throes of the old politics ’ , and he hoped to usher in an ‘ open , transparent and trusted ’ era			0
welcoming : unite general secretary @entity35 said he was ¿ very comfortable ¿ with the proposals rather than being automatically affiliated , union members should be asked to make an active decision to join the party by opting in			1
they would no longer automatically pay a £ 3 fee to the party from their union subscriptions and would instead have to opt in			0
yet , while @entity7 risks losing millions of pounds from the political levy , unions will lose nothing since they will be able to keep the money that would have been paid to @entity7 for themselves			1
@entity3 aides admitted there is nothing to stop union barons using that cash to make one - off payments to @entity7 ’s election war chest instead			1
if membership rises , union bosses could also end up with more power to pick @entity102 – even though the reforms are ostensibly designed to loosen their grip on selections			0
three million members of unions affiliated to @entity7 pay the levy , one million are @entity36 members			1
@entity112 members who opt - in will become affiliate members of the party and would win new rights to vote in primary elections to pick @entity7 candidates			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ in the 21st century it just does n’t make sense for anyone to be affiliated to a political party unless they have chosen to do so			0
’ mr @entity35 yesterday predicted that 100,000 of his members would keep paying the levy , giving the most powerful union baron a block of supporters			1
he said the move could swell party membership from 200,000 to ‘ a far higher number ’ and admitted @entity130 will now have to consider how the changes will affect union power in leadership elections and during votes at @entity7 conference , where the unions control 50 per cent of the votes			1
new age : in a @entity76 speech , mr @entity3 said @entity54 represented ¿ part of the death - throes of the old politics ¿ , and he hoped to usher in an ¿ open , transparent and trusted ¿ era aides admitted that in leadership elections ‘ the electoral college could stay ’ , meaning unions will retain 30 per cent of the vote which helped mr @entity3 to defeat his brother			0
mr @entity3 dismissed claims that @entity130 is a union stooge			0
but in a blow to the leader , former @entity7 general secretary @entity151 revealed he turned down the job because it was ‘ unworkable ’			1
mr @entity35 was delighted that mr @entity3 refused to change the law to force unions to give up the cash from the levy if members opt out			1
he said : ‘ those who pay the levy , he wants them to have a second option to see whether they want to opt in to becoming associate members of the @entity7			1
’ @entity166 denounced the plans as a ‘ smokescreen ’			1
further allegations last night appeared to suggest rigging was not confined to @entity54 alone			0
@entity171 , a former candidate in @entity172 , alleged that @entity36 fixed the selection in favour of its candidate , @entity175			0
miss @entity175 was named on a list of candidates whose selection unite boasted they had secured			2
@entity3 sought to regain the initiative yesterday amid questions over who really controls his party			0
here we analyse the speech he never wanted to give			0
what he said : ‘ what we saw in @entity54 is part of the death - throes of the old politics ... it comes against growing mistrust in politics			0
‘ as the @entity7 – the party of working people – we have a special responsibility to stand for a better politics			1
’ what he meant : admits his initiative was prompted by the sensational allegations that union members were signed up as party members without their knowledge to influence the selection of a candidate in @entity54			0
until now , he has shown no desire to take on the union barons , to whom he owes his victory against brother @entity166 in the party leadership contest			1
on the front foot : @entity3 sought to regain the initiative yesterday what he said : ‘ we do not need to change that law on the right of trade unions to have political funds			0
but i do want to change the way individual trade unionists are affiliated to the @entity7 through these funds ... ‘ individual trade union members should choose to join @entity7 through the affiliation fee , not be automatically affiliated			1
’ what he meant : plans for opt - in payment for union members would certainly deprive the party of some cash			2
but even though less money may go to it directly , subscription funds will be available for union leaders to distribute as they see fit – on @entity233 campaigns , or donations in the run - up to an election , for example			0
it will also mean union members who agree to pay the affiliation fee become party members			0
@entity35 estimates that at least 100,000 of his membership will sign up			2
what he said : ‘ i have asked @entity44 , former general secretary of the @entity7 , to lead work on how to make this a reality			1
’ unimpressed : prime minister @entity166 denounced @entity3 's plans as a smokescreen what he meant : lord @entity44 is the former assistant general secretary of the @entity112 and in 2007 helped steer through a merger with @entity249 to create the super-union @entity36			1
tories said the selection of a union man revealed mr @entity3 ’s reform plan as a ‘ stitch - up ’			0
what he said : ‘ we will urgently agree new spending limits for @entity260 selections to include for the first time all spending by outside organisations			0
’ what he meant : argues a spending cap will limit ‘ machine politics ’ by unions when it comes to picking candidates			0
but there is no indication of what the limit will be			0
crucially , there is no intention to change the leadership rules which means the unions control around a third of @entity7 ’s electoral college what he said : ‘ can it be right that the rules allow mps to earn hundreds of thousands of pounds from private legal practice while they are supposed to be an mp , or from outside corporations without any real form of regulation ? ... at the very least there should be new limits on outside earnings			2
’ what he meant : a crude but effective attempt to turn some heat on the @entity251			0
before the last election , @entity166 persuaded the then shadow @entity293 to drop outside interests , but would face uproar if he tried the same with his mps			2
what he said : ‘ i propose for the next @entity299 election @entity7 will have a primary for our candidate selection			2
any @entity76 should be eligible to vote and all they will need to do is to register as a supporter of the @entity7 at any time up to the ballot			2
@entity44 will examine how to pioneer this idea elsewhere too , such as in future @entity260 selections where a sitting mp is retiring and where the local party has dwindled			0
’ what he meant : @entity309 - style primaries have been pioneered by the @entity251 , who used them to select some of their candidates in 2010			0
critics say the system gives extra power to those with backing from the media or deep pockets .			0

the @entity7 leader billed his plans as ' big and historic changes '
unite general secretary @entity35 is ' very comfortable ' with plans
but prime minister @entity166 denounced them as a ' smokescreen '
