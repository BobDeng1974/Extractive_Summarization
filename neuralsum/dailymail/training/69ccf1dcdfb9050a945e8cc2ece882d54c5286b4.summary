they have lain unseen for centuries – a carefully arranged group of skeletons deep beneath what became one of the busiest areas of @entity7			2
millions of feet have tramped unwittingly above them through the years ; thousands of tons of earth and rubble concealed their grave			2
but yesterday it was hoped that the dna within the nine sets of remains would unlock a mystery that has baffled and divided medical minds for generations : what caused the @entity22 in 1348 ? carefully laid out skeletons thought to be from a 14th century burial ground that have been discovered in @entity7 during work on the £ 14.8billion @entity27 project @entity28 , an osteologist from the @entity30 's @entity29 , inspects a skeleton they were discovered during excavation work for the £ 14.8billion @entity27 project , currently carving a subterranean path across @entity7			1
they were more than 8ft below a road between @entity37 and @entity39 stations , leading internet wags to suggest they probably died waiting for a @entity43 train			1
in fact the bodies are believed to have been among the 1.5million @entity46 who died when the plague swept through @entity48			0
sizing things up : the skeletons were carefully laid out in rows eight feet beneath the surface archaeologists from the @entity30 's @entity29 work on uncovering the bodies emergency mass graves were dug , but the corpses were not simply thrown in			1
men and women were placed @entity59 in uniform rows , often with hands folded across the torso			0
a similar skeleton formation was found in the 1980s at nearby @entity64 , and as many as 50,000 might have been buried in the area over three years			0
@entity27 lead archaeologist @entity66 said : ' this is a highly significant discovery and at the moment we are left with many questions that we hope to answer			1
men and women were placed @entity59 in uniform rows , often with hands folded across the torso the skeletons were more than 8ft below a road between @entity37 and @entity39 stations dna experts are working with archaeologists at the @entity37 site to try to identify the exact cause from bone samples ' we will be undertaking scientific tests on the skeletons to establish their cause of death , whether they were plague victims from the 14th century or later residents , how old they were and perhaps evidence of who they were			1
' however , at this early stage all points towards this being part of the 14th - century emergency burial ground			0
' around a third of the population of @entity46 died in the @entity22			0
estimates of how many perished in @entity48 and elsewhere vary between 25million and 200million , making it the grimmest and most destructive pandemic in human history			0
@entity28 , an osteologist from the @entity30 's @entity29 , inspects evidence of a lost burial ground dating from the @entity104 in 1348 hidden secrets : @entity28 holds the skull of one of the skeletons discovered under the streets of @entity7 dna analysis of @entity48 victims has suggested that the yersinia pestis bacterium was responsible , but many scientists believe the infection was a rapidly - spreading virus			2
now dna experts are working with archaeologists at the @entity37 site to try to identify the exact cause from bone samples			2
once analysis is complete , the skeletons will be reburied on the site or at a cemetery			0
new discovery : scientists will take samples from the human remains to try and find out how they died delicate operation : archaeologist and site supervisor @entity129 from the @entity30 's @entity29 working in a grout shaft locator : the skeletons were discovered buried underneath a road in @entity135 in @entity7			1

remains were discovered during work for £ 14.8bn @entity27 project
they were 8ft beneath a road between @entity37 and @entity143
