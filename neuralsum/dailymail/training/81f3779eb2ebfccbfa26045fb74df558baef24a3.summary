early pioneer : @entity1 was one of the first people to suggest a complete overhaul of the contents of your fridge as a good way to lose weight i ’m 50 and have spent my life overweight			1
i ’ve done the @entity12 and @entity13 diets and @entity14 , which left me bigger			1
i ’m now on the @entity15 but have lost only 5lb in two months			1
am i cursed ? you should be proud of yourself for persevering , but it sounds like you ’ve fallen into the yo - yo dieting trap			1
the @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity14 are some of the most extreme diet plans on the market , and while this often works in the short term , restricting your calorie intake or cutting out whole food groups leads to fat gain when not on the diet			1
on the 5:2 you can eat what you want for five days a week , then restrict your calorie intake to a quarter of what ’s recommended ( 600 for men , 500 for women ) on the others			1
but this is a little misleading			1
if what you like eating on the normal days is processed food and sugary cakes and biscuits , you are n’t going to see the results you want			2
is it also possible you have been treating yourself on these days , due to your disappointment at failing to get to the weight you want ? eating emotionally is another pitfall , as you ’re more likely to reach for high - fat , high - sugar foods to make you feel better			2
i suggest a total overhaul of the contents of your fridge and kitchen cupboards			2
@entity1 was one of the early pioneers of what ’s considered a really healthy diet now , and one that will help you shed the pounds effortlessly			2
this will mean cutting out all processed foods – that ’s anything that comes in a packet or has ingredients that sound like they were made in a laboratory			2
dairy products , especially cheese , are also restricted			0
instead , stock up on fresh fruit and vegetables , whole grains , organic eggs and other forms of animal protein , and nuts and seeds to snack on			0
i guarantee that combining these foods with the 5:2 eating plan , as well as adding some regular exercise ( even fast walking ) will help you see the results you want			0
the @entity78 , whose supporters include @entity81 , above , have launched a ‘ @entity83 ’ sobriety challenge go sober ... every month last week i had my first glass of wine in a month - just as ‘ @entity86 ’ was being launched			0
i had been on ‘ @entity87 ’ , despite my belief that moderation is better than an all - or - nothing approach			0
however , my mood definitely improved without a tipple and i felt more focused			0
now the @entity78 – supporters include @entity81 - have launched another challenge called ‘ @entity83 ’			0
perhaps my new approach will be a month - on , month - off			0
@entity96 rules in the kitchen i love the idea behind a new book by @entity101 yogi and it girl @entity96			1
called @entity104 , it is divided into three sections – mat , cushion and kitchen – and designed to help you tap into the foods your body really needs with the help of regular yoga and meditation			1
the idea is that by taking the time to get in touch with your body , you wo n’t need to go on a ‘ diet ’ because you ’ll be able to distinguish between real hunger and cravings , and nip emotional overeating in the bud			1
@entity96 ’s also a vegan , so the recipes in the book are all plant - based – but the message is about finding a healthy approach to eating that ’s 100 per cent right for you			0
