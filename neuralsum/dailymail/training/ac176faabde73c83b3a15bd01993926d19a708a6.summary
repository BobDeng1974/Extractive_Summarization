by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has urged @entity3 to cure their ' weaknesses in the system ' after a qualifying gaffe left him fighting an uphill battle in sunday 's @entity8			1
with a time on the board and @entity2 sitting in his car in the garage , three times the @entity9 asked whether he was safe , and three times he was urged not to worry			1
whatever or whoever the source of the information , it proved unreliable as @entity3 academy driver @entity18 in his @entity19 bumped @entity2 down to 17th at the death and out of qualifying			1
@entity2 said : ' the plan was to go out , but the team said " no , you are fine , you do not need to go out "			1
' i questioned it a few times , but they said no need , and we can see the end result			0
' what happened is not good for me or the team , and although it has been a difficult year i do n't see the point to shout			2
' i 've made mistakes in the past , i will make them in the future , and people do make mistakes , but there are things we have to change to improve			2
' as a team in @entity53 , as @entity3 , we should not be doing these kind of things			0
none of us are in our first year			0
' @entity57 for more : @entity2 has endured a difficult season on his return to @entity60 @entity2 conceded he could have over-ruled the team and insisted on returning to the track , but at the end of the day he relied on the advice afforded him			1
' i trust in the team , believe in the people , ' added @entity2			1
' i questioned it , but i can not always go against advice			0
we are here as a team , make decisions as a team , and today the outcome was this			0
' obviously we have to improve , to do things differently because we can see there are weaknesses in the system			2
' since returning to the team , @entity2 has so far played a bit - part role as he been heavily out - qualified by team - mate @entity80 and finished behind the @entity81 in all 10 races			1
the 34 - year - old maintains , however , that despite his problems , what is occurring has no bearing on his future			0
' it will not influence my decision , ' said @entity2			1
' i 've a contract , i fully believe in @entity3 , i 've enjoyed a lot of wins and success with them			0
on track : @entity18 will start @entity97 's race ahead of @entity98 after @entity3 's error ' it 's been a difficult year , which is life			1
it 's not fun when you have hard times , it 's happened before and that 's how it goes			2
' we try to improve things , try to make things better all the time , make less mistakes , get the car where i want it to be to be fast again			1
' i 've not suddenly over the winter lost a few seconds lap time , so it 's the case of putting things in the right places for me			2
' unfortunately we have n't managed to do it now and then , we are still fighting against things a lot , and the results show			0
' if it were easier , as sometimes it goes , then we would be laughing , but that was not the case today , and has not been the case this year			0
' as i say , i trust in the team , but there have to be changes and improvements , which can only happen if we work as a team , as a group , as @entity3			0

@entity2 was told he did n't need to improve his time in qualifying
the @entity9 *remained* in the garage but his time was *usurped* by @entity18
it means he will start only 17th for sunday 's @entity57 @entity8
