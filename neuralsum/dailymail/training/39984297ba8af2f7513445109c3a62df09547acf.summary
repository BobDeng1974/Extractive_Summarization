by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 18 july 2013 @entity2 bosses are on track for nearly £ 5million of ' double your money ' bonuses after a controversial new incentive scheme was nodded through at the company 's annual meeting			1
it means the top five rail directors are set to share in total pay - outs worth more than £ 11million - comprising basic salary , annual bonuses and long - term bonuses - for just three years ' work			1
this is despite @entity2 missing all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012 - 13 and being warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £ 75million fine by @entity23 next year over fears it will miss future targets for long distance services			1
pay day : @entity2 bosses are in line for millions of pounds in extra bonuses by 2015 under a deal agreed today angry critics and unions condemned the bonuses as ' rewards for failure ' and ' a gravy train ' , branding the five top directors of the taxpayer - funded track operator ' fat controllers ' presiding over crowded trains , late - running services and inflation - busting fares			2
the five directors ' income is made up of three distinct pots - their annual salaries , their annual bonuses , and a ' long term incentive ' payment paid at the end of three years and worth a maximum of a full - year 's salary			1
the total potential bonuses might have been closer to £ 6million , but the directors were docked up to £ 1million from their annual bonuses last year because they failed to hit some targets			1
the new long term bonus element - worth £ 2million alone - was rubber - stamped at @entity2 's annual general meeting in @entity57			1
it was voted on by @entity2 's 44 ' members ' - the company 's equivalent to shareholders - whose job is to hold the board to account			0
however , as a company limited by guarantee , @entity2 's members do not have any financial interest in the company			0
it means that over three years : the annual bonuses pays bosses up to 60per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction			1
but with these targets missed last year , executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary			2
the @entity80 's ( @entity80 ) described the bonus vote as ' rewarding failure ' amid concerns about service punctuality , rising train fares and a number of rail - related deaths			0
cash : @entity2 chief executive @entity88 ( left ) is on track for £ 3.1million over three years while @entity90 , managing director of infrastructure projects , could receive £ 1.9million @entity80 's general secretary @entity92 said the union was ' bitterly disappointed ' by the plan : ' once again public members of @entity2 have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers			1
these bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above - inflation fare rises			0
' but @entity2 defended the bonuses and said they would only be achieved - in part or in full - if ' tough ' targets were met			0
last year , following political pressure , bosses waived a bonus package and instead allocated their windfall to a safety improvement programme - which has seen @entity2 placed in the spotlight following a series of high profile incidents			0
earlier this year , @entity2 was handed a £ 450,000 fine for failing to ensure the safety of 52 - year - old @entity118 killed who was killed when her car was hit by a train at a level crossing in @entity123 , in january 2010			0
@entity2 's @entity125 - born chief executive mr @entity88 told members at its annual meeting that 750 crossings had been closed noting : ' in my opinion the only good level crossing is a closed one			2
' mr @entity88 also conceded that more could have been done to prevent the death of 26 - year - old rail worker @entity134 , who died after being hit by a train near @entity136 last december			0
@entity80 general secretary @entity92 condemned the ' unfair ' long - term bonus scheme before the vote tssa union general secretary @entity92 wrote to the voting members urging them to reject the ' generous ' but ' unfair ' long - term bonus scheme			2
he told them : ' long term and annual bonuses could produce total bonus payments of £ 5.8million in the three years ending in april 2015			1
that huge amount would be on top of an annual salary bill of some £ 6million for the same period for the same five executives , giving potential total earnings of over £ 11 million between the period 2012 and 2015			2
' he noted : ' we regard those sort of payments at a tax payer funded infrastructure firm as wholly wrong , especially in view of the executives missed punctuality targets and safety record in recent years			1
' @entity2 said the long term bonus is ' to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015			1
' it said any future awards will be measured against train performance , savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects			0
@entity2 chairman @entity167 , who does not receive any bonuses said : ' @entity2 executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets , which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process			2
' if targets are not met , or safety comprised , no bonuses are made			0
' he insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months with passenger numbers rising to 1.5 billion and £ 4.4billion worth of improvement on ' @entity184 ' rail network			0
the long - term bonus plan targets include : taxpayer savings ( 50 % of total ) , train performance and punctuality ( 25 % of total ) , and its management of capital projects ( 25 % of total )			1
@entity2 said : ' under the scheme , pay - outs would commence at 25 % of annual salary if performance was deemed to have exceeded expectations using the above measures			0
