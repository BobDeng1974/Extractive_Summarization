but as a new mother , it appeared even the @entity10 can forget to touch up her roots from time to time after she displayed a smattering of grey hairs earlier this month			1
the grey hairs were long gone this evening however when @entity10 attended a charity ball with her dark , wavy locks back to their glossy best			1
but it was her hair that sparked the most interest after apparently having undergone a transformation since her other recent outing			2
her hair became the focus at a recent @entity44 event in @entity26 when she displayed several grey hairs in her centre parting , while her eyes were also perhaps a little shadowed			1
many new mothers , like @entity10 , find that their hair changes after they give birth			0
greying hair is not normally directly associated with pregnancy , however , any form of stress can encourage it and can be a side effect of being pregnant or giving birth			0

but tonight her hair appeared significantly darker and more bouncy than it has of late			1
she also appeared to have had an inch or two trimmed from the length			0
@entity10 , 31 , left four - month - old baby @entity76 with daddy at @entity78 while she attended the @entity80 ball as patron of the charity , which provides financial support for promising young athletes			0
according to sources @entity10 normally enhances her sleek hairstyle with an organic vegetable - based colour wash and subtle low lights at the @entity90 salon in @entity91			0
@entity10 's hair has long been the envy of women around the world			1
her thick mahogany locks that never frizz , kink or wisp have , unsurprisingly , become her trademark			0
@entity22 of @entity23 , who left her hair long and loose , with blonde highlights ( and a hint of grey ) coming through the chestnut , rides a 1960s @entity104 bus as part of the @entity107 events sources have previously said that the @entity10 had , to her horror , started finding the odd grey hair ( â € ˜ stress highlightsâ € ™ , her friends joke ) before her pregnancy @entity10 pulls her hair away from her face and enjoys a laugh as she and prince @entity67 arrive to meet staff and volunteers in fact , the ' cascading locks ' of the former @entity10 were voted the celebrity hair other women would most like to have			1
@entity10 's hair was followed closely by the wavy blonde ' elegant and effortless ' tresses of @entity126 's ex-wife @entity127 , and the shiny ' big bouffant ' of singer @entity129			2
model and presenter @entity130 , @entity134 @entity133 and new mum @entity135 also made it into the top five , while @entity137 just missed out			0
the survey , conducted by professional hair product retailer , @entity140 , polled 700 of the site 's female users and asked them which celebrity hair they would most like to have			0
and with @entity10 's hair back in tip - top shape , it appears she is likely to stay at the top			2
this time last year , pictured above , @entity10 's hair was noticeably darker , and parted at the side			2
