' this has led to more deaths as traffickers have exploited the situation using boats that are unfit to make the crossing			0
' foreign office minister @entity63 said : ' the government believes the most effective way to prevent refugees and migrants attempting this dangerous crossing is to focus our attention on countries of origin and transit , as well as taking steps to fight the people smugglers who willfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats			2
