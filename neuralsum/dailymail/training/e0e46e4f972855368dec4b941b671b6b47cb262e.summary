by @entity0 one ambitious young artist has transplanted a chocolate - making factory line from his native @entity3 to @entity4 to create 7,000 candies per day – all of which will be free to the public			1
by showcasing @entity3 ’s popular @entity11 marshmallow candy as art , @entity9 , 28 , hopes to create a narrative about globalization , immigration , and community inside the renowned @entity18 gallery			1
the exhibit , titled ‘ a @entity20 ’ , which opens today , brings a piece of mr @entity9 ’s hometown of @entity23 , @entity3 to the @entity24 – including 13 factory workers who have never before left their native country			1
transplanted : artist @entity9 has brought @entity3 's @entity28 chocolate factory to @entity4 's @entity18 gallery in - house operation : the factory will produce 7,000 of @entity33 's @entity11 candies each day , which will be free to the public @entity35 view : @entity18 's 19th @entity38 outpost is located in @entity4 's @entity40 neighborhood , home to the city 's most famous art galleries mr @entity9 did not choose to feature the @entity11 on a whim			1
rather , he feels a strong connection to candy ’s owner , @entity28 – his hometown ’s largest employer – as generations of his family have worked in the company ’s factories , including his own parents			0
his latest exhibit , housed in mr @entity18 ’s 19th street location , hopes to offer both strong in - person and social media experiences for gallery - goers			1
as mr @entity9 explained in a press conference yesterday afternoon , the show is a ‘ social endeavor			2
’ upon entering @entity64 , guests are greeted by an acute sugar smell , which materializes all around in crates and trays full of @entity68 that are free for the taking			1
its lobby is filled with tvs displaying a live feed of the factory line that has been set up within the gallery – an area which has been cut off from guests for sanitary purposes			0
the streaming footage can also be viewed online throughout the show ’s run			0
it depicts @entity33 employees , dressed in stark white uniforms and goggles , creating a pillowy confection that is one of @entity28 ’s best - sellers throughout @entity89 , with nearly 5million pieces clearing store shelves each year			2
bright young thing : mr @entity9 ( center , black shirt ) is only 28 , but has already shown at @entity95 and the @entity96 , since signing with @entity18 in september 2013 ( pictured , mr @entity9 poses with members of the @entity33 staff inside his new exhibit ) special design : mr @entity9 has custom created the smiley face wrappers for his exhibition , as a way to merge a @entity4 icon with that of @entity33 gallery - goers will receive the chocolate - covered marshmallows in a wrapper that mr @entity9 has custom - designed to provide subliminal commentary on the exhibit ’s deeper meaning			1
the silver envelopes come branded with @entity33 ’s signature red , white , and blue logo , as well as the bright yellow smiley face that adorns many of @entity4 ’s plastic shopping bags			2
in merging the two icons , the @entity121 - based artist somewhat simplistically represents the @entity64 ’s personal message – which touches upon his own experiences with @entity33 as well as trans - @entity126 immigration			1
it 's a touching sentiment that carries throughout his entire body of art which most often takes the form of large - scale paintings			0
a young success by art 's standards , mr @entity9 has already exhibited in esteemed locations including the @entity96 and @entity95 since first joining the @entity18 gallery in september 2013			1
restricted area : while press were able to navigate the factory facilities yesterday , gallery goers will see the candy process on live stream footage , screened on tvs in the gallery lobby ever the millennial , mr @entity9 's shiny , @entity148 - friendly wrappers also accomplish another of the exhibit ’s main objectives – for gallery - goers to share their @entity11 experience on social media			1
because there is no limit to how many @entity158 guest may take , mr @entity9 hopes that patrons will offer the candies to their friends , families , even strangers , while documenting this shared enjoyment with photos tagged # @entity164			2
but the show is much more than just a load of free candy , or even using candy as a decorative medium , as artists like @entity171 have so successfully accomplished in the past			0
it has afforded 13 @entity3 the opportunity to leave their country for the very first time			2
the candy technicians have arrived to the @entity24 on special artists ’ visas , and will work the gallery ’s regular hours of 10am to 6pm from tuesday through saturday			0
deeper meaning : mr @entity9 's family , including his mother ( pictured ) have worked at the @entity28 factory , which is his hometown 's single largest employer throughout a @entity20 ’s nearly three - week - long run , they will reside in a community of apartments in @entity190 , @entity191			1
@entity192 , @entity33 ’s ceo , told @entity193 that the experience ‘ has been incredible – we were afraid that so many parts in the process would get stuck , but it ended up working perfectly			0
it ’s almost too good to be true			0
’ from @entity201 ’s perspective , a @entity20 is an interesting way to introduce its products to the @entity24 audience			0
mr @entity192 said that ‘ from a commercial point of view it ’s nice to show @entity24 that there is a company down in @entity209 that has good vibes , that is making delicious candy … and wants to give prosperity to people who work for the company			0
’ millennial concept : guests are encouraged to share these packages with friends , families , and even strangers , while documenting the entire experience on @entity148 last evening at dinner held in the project ’s honor at mr @entity18 ’s @entity227 townhouse , the entire @entity28 fleet broke out into a celebratory salsa dance			0
mr @entity192 says that ’ one of the girls told me when we were dancing : “ i never dreamt i would be dancing salsa in a beautiful home in @entity4 ” it ’s a short phrase that describes a lot			0

@entity9 's @entity64 will produce 7,000 candies each day at the @entity18 gallery in @entity4
the chocolate - covered marshmallows , called @entity68 , will be offered to the public for free
@entity11 's parent company @entity33 has transplanted 13 factory workers to @entity4 for the exhibit - marking their first trip outside @entity3
