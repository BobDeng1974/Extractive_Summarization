@entity1 star @entity0 faces having to knock down a £ 40,000 football pitch built in his back garden , because it does n't have proper planning permission			1
the @entity6 captain , who is set to play for @entity1 in the @entity7 in @entity8 before joining @entity9 , commissioned the large area to be built in the garden of his home in @entity13			0
the 26 - year - old had planned to use the astro turf pitch - which also doubles as a basketball court - for ‘ kickabouts ’ with his young family			1
@entity1 footballer @entity0 faces having to knock down a £ 40,000 football pitch built in his back garden , because it does n't have proper planning permission			1
pictured is neighbour @entity22 but the fenced off area has been developed without proper planning permission			1
one of the footballer 's neighbours has since complained to their local council and mp about the scale of the development which prompted planning officials to look into the matter			2
they discovered the height of the multi-use games area , in particular the basketball hoops and back boards , was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent			2
@entity0 will either have to adjust it or submit a retrospective application for consideration			1
if this fails , under planning law , he could be ordered to demolish the construction			2
@entity0 , who is currently in @entity46 with the @entity1 squad , is said to be considering the latter option			2
the row started after he built a separate wooden play area in his garden with permission			2
but then the football pitch which is similar to fenced - off games areas seen in most towns and which cost between £ 40,000 to £ 60,000 to build , was added			1
@entity0 will either have to adjust it or submit a retrospective application for consideration @entity22 , who lives next door to mr @entity0 ’s £ 1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches			1
mr @entity22 , who has lived with his wife @entity63 at their home for more than 20 years , said : ' we did n’t object to this application , why would we ? we understand kids need somewhere to play			0
' but then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we could n’t work out what was going on			0
we saw this sports pitch being built and we just could n’t believe it			0
' the council enforcement officer told us it was more in - keeping with a council play park than a garden in a special character area , which this area is			0
' he was given 28 days to submit a planning application but that deadline has gone			0
' he ’s done nothing and the council have n’t taken any further action			0
' @entity85 , development management manager at @entity86 , said : ' every applicant is dealt with in exactly the same way			0
@entity0 commissioned the large area to be built in the garden of his home in @entity13 but council officers discovered the height of the multi-use games area , in particular the basketball hoops and back boards , was beyond permitted development rules and required planning consent @entity22 , who lives next door to mr @entity0 's £ 1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the prospect of noisy sports matches ' our enforcement team have been in contact with the agent and we anticipate an application for the multi-use games area very soon			1
' @entity109 , a planning consultant acting for mr @entity0 , said : ' the area of hard standing to be used as a knock - about pitch has been agreed by @entity86 as ‘ permitted development ’ and does not need planning permission			1
' the majority of the fencing is two metres or less in height and also does not need planning permission			1
' over the small goal areas fencing has been raised to support a basketball hoop			0
technically that part needs planning permission as it is more than two metres in height			1
star in the making : @entity0 broke into the @entity1 side after impressing for @entity6 ' my client went around to the neighbour and apologised and has asked a landscape architect to mitigate the visual impact of the hoop			0
' mr @entity0 moved into his current house two years ago after failing with plans to extend his former home in @entity134 , near @entity135			0
but the footballer , who is said to earn £ 50,000 pounds a week , is likely to be moving again soon as he is widely tipped to join @entity9 this summer in a deal worth £ 25 million .			0

@entity0 planned to use pitch for ‘ kickabouts ’ with his young family
but the construction has been built without proper planning permission
@entity0 must now apply for retrospective planning permission
now neighbours say they *'re* concerned about noisy football games
