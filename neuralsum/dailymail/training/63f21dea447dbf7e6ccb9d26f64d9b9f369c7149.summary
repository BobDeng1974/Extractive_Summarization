@entity0 could soon overtake @entity1 in market share as more middle class families choose to shop at the budget chain			1

this means 4.8 per cent of shoppers now visit @entity0 , up from 3.7 per cent this time last year and rapidly approaching @entity1 ’s 4.9 per cent share			1
@entity7 invasion : budget supermarket @entity0 now has 4.8 per cent of @entity14 food shoppers coming through their doors - up from 3.7 per cent last year this means 4.8 per cent of @entity14 ’s food shoppers now walk through its doors , up from 3.7 per cent this time last year and a hair ’s breadth away from @entity1 , which commands 4.9 per cent of the market			1
@entity23 , a director at @entity24 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s 32 per cent growth rate has lifted its market share to 4.8 per cent ; this is a new record for the retailer and means it has nearly caught up with @entity1			1
’ @entity29 and @entity30 held on to their market share , recording growth of 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively			1
but the rise of the discounters has struck at the heart of the @entity37 grocers			0
@entity0 ’s arch - rival @entity38 , also @entity7 - owned , recorded sales growth of 19.5 per cent and saw its market share rise from 3.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent			1
@entity42 has been struggling to turn around its troubled @entity14 chain and last week ditched chief executive @entity44 after the latest in a string of profit warnings			1
up - and - coming : also is now closing in on @entity1 , which has a 4.9 per cent share of the @entity14 market the data also shows @entity42 has suffered its worst sales decline in at least two decades , with a fall of 3.8pc			1
that is its steepest decline since comparable records began in 1994			0
@entity42 ’s market share fell to 28.9 per cent from 30.3 per cent a year ago , despite investing £ 1bn in cutting prices , improving service and staff numbers , and refreshing stores			2
the market has become polarised with the biggest growth found at the discounters and at the upper end , while the mid-market players have been squeezed			2
@entity42 and @entity65 have both been forced to respond by investing hundreds of millions of pounds in a price war			0
@entity0 ’s joint managing director @entity67 told the @entity68 he was glad he did n’t run @entity42 : ‘ i ’m glad we do n’t have huge complex beasts with online , banking , huge ranges and am thankful what we have is simple			2
this has enabled us to be close to the market			2
’ joint managing director @entity76 said : ‘ this price war magnifies our offer			0
everyone talks about narrowing the gap on @entity0 , highlighting that we have the best offers			2
‘ plus it spells out to shoppers that if they are only narrowing the gap it means that they do n’t want to match us on price			0
’ @entity0 has a finely - honed model , selling a limited range of 1,500 lines instead of the 40,000 stocked in the mainstream supermarkets , of which 90 per cent are own brand			1
it stocks just three different types of olive oil compared with the 20 or so found in a @entity42			0
@entity0 ’s olive oil buyer is able to know the supplier and the three products inside out because the range is so small			2
mr @entity76 says : ‘ this allows us to concentrate our efforts on making this product the best olive oil on the market			0
it also means we buy a higher volume ( per line ) than our competitors do			0
this allows us to offer incredible value to our customers			0
’ in a recent @entity68 taste test @entity0 ’s olive oil at £ 2.69 for 500ml was given 10/10 compared to the 7/10 given to @entity1 ’s extra virgin olive oil at £ 14.99 for 500ml			1
it also uses checkouts that were developed and patented by its @entity7 parent , where the conveyor belts are longer to accommodate the entire contents of a trolley load			0
the items have bigger bar codes in three different positions which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned			0
@entity0 claims this enables customers to pass through the tills 40 per cent faster , meaning shorter queues			1
waiting times are also shortened because shoppers are not allowed to pack their bags at the tills – they have to reload their trolleys and bag up their items a shelf at the back of the store			0
