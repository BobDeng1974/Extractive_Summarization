at the end of the 10 - day inquest yesterday , @entity22 coroner @entity21 recorded a narrative conclusion , saying that although there were ' lost opportunities ' in @entity16 's care , they did not amount to neglect			1
plea : @entity10 and @entity11 ( left ) told the inquest how they had begged doctors and nurses on @entity6 's @entity34 to help their desperately ill son @entity16 ( right ) @entity36 , chief executive of the @entity37 , apologised to @entity38 and mrs @entity11 , and insisted changes had been made following @entity16 's death			1

mrs @entity11 , a foster carer , told @entity47 she wanted a public inquiry into her son 's death			2
' @entity16 suffered a lot of failings in his care			0
we feel at every level the ward did not recognise his deterioration and that led to the complications that led to his death , ' she said			0
' we feel there is much more that needs investigating and the coroner 's inquest did n't do that fully			0
' her husband , a carpenter , added : ' i think we feel now that the coroner was very weak			0
we wished she would have done some letters of recommendation to the trust ... we feel that @entity16 was treated very poorly			0
' care : @entity16 , shown here on holiday in @entity75 , died in part due to poor nursing , according to his parents hopeful : @entity16 , left , from @entity12 , in @entity13 , excitedly told friends that doctors were going to ' mend his heart ' but he later died			1
his parents ( right ) called his care ' shocking and unacceptable ' ' we are pleased they have made changes within the hospital			1
we just feel they should have been imposed while @entity16 was in there , ' he said			0
' they obviously were n't in place when @entity16 was in there because they would n't have spent Â£ 1.3 million on it so soon after @entity16 ... all we 've ever wanted is the truth and we only want the hospital to be truthful with us that they failed @entity16 , and they did fail @entity16			0
' during the inquest , @entity38 and mrs @entity11 gave harrowing accounts of their son 's care and treatment during a six - week stay at the hospital , which is regarded as a centre of excellence			1

the @entity137 carried out an unannounced inspection and issued a formal warning to the hospital about standards on @entity34			0

trust chief executive @entity148 apologised to @entity38 and mrs @entity11 and said the trust always sought to improve services			0
' the coroner has heard that their son @entity16 was born with a very rare and complex heart condition and was undergoing a procedure which carries a known risk of death , ' he said			2
' but the inquest has also highlighted some missed opportunities in the care we gave to @entity16 when managing his post-operative complications and shortcomings in our communication with the family			2
