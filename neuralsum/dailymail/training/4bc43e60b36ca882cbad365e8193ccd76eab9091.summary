the @entity7 artist and @entity8 , known for his ceramic vases and cross-dressing , was spotted on @entity11 's @entity13 documentary carrying his beloved ' @entity14 '			1
the tote was designed by @entity2 himself in the shape of a scrotum , before being moulded into a handbag by leather craftsman @entity20			2
@entity23 's oddest handbag ? @entity2 has been sporting the ' @entity14 ' around @entity24 in recent months the bag , which has toured @entity26 with @entity2 , was made as a gift by @entity20 from @entity28 after he and @entity29 met in 2008			1
speaking to @entity30 about the intriguing design , which also has a frontal ' appendage ' with a bell at its end , @entity20 said : ' i received an email from @entity2 to which was attached a particular drawing ; a drawing which was the potter 's design for the ' @entity14 '			1
