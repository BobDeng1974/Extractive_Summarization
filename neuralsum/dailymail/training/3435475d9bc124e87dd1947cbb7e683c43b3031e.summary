will @entity0 win the @entity1 without @entity2 ? will @entity0 win the @entity1 without @entity2 ? now share your opinion in the end the parties on the ocean front at @entity7 would go on through the night			1
@entity0 would n’t have it any other way			2
@entity11 made sure of that after his spectacular second half free - kick , straight out of @entity15 ’s handbook , confirmed their place in the last four			1
the whole place was rocking , with thumping samba music celebrating the country ’s place in a @entity1 semi-final against @entity23			1
the atmosphere in this city was truly remarkable			0
their players were woken up yesterday morning by a loudspeaker repeatedly playing @entity50 outside their beachfront hotel in @entity52			1
the noise , the colour , the drama and the build - up was incredible			0
two miles down the road , in the @entity59 , thousands of street kids wearing @entity0 kits were waiting outside the team hotel to wish them on their way			1
it was there that @entity65 paid a short visit to the small chapel in the grounds before they left for the game , turning to religion in his 90 minutes of need			0
football is the opium of the masses here , an obsession that takes them away from the hum of ordinary life and unites a nation of nearly 200m people for 90 steamy minutes			0
speak to them about the achievement of winning the @entity1 and they will respond by saying ' e os outtos catorze ' ( ' yes , but what of the other 14 ? ' )			2
they really believe they should win this tournament every time			0
eager : @entity0 supporters try to get a glimpse of their heroes arriving at the stadium for the @entity25 match loud and proud : @entity95 in @entity52 was rocking with yellow shirts for @entity0 's showdown with @entity25 golden boy : the crowd responded every time their talisman @entity2 got near the ball celebrate : the @entity0 team together after @entity103 gave the host nation the lead against @entity25 6 - @entity107 ( @entity25 ) 4 - @entity108 ( @entity23 ) , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity2 ( @entity0 ) 3 - @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , @entity115 ( @entity114 ) , @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , @entity118 ( @entity119 ) those in italic are out of the @entity1			1
on friday it was almost impossible to contain their fans as they pressed their faces against the fencing for a glimpse of @entity2 , @entity11 or @entity103 when they walked out of the team hotel			1
they had arrived the night before , when two @entity130 helicopters buzzed the team bus with a searchlight and guided it through @entity52 ’s sweeping streets towards their lodgings			2
it felt like showtime and the stadium , packed to the rafters with yellow shirts and those damned five stars , was absolutely rocking			0
there was noise like you can not imagine , a piercing sense of anticipation every time @entity2 and the rest of these golden boys are anywhere near the ball			0
the @entity1 is not just about the best individual players or the squad with most ability , it ’s about coping with the changing situations and demands of tournament football			2
the early goal helped them			0
the captain @entity103 was under pressure , scrutinised like never before after opting out when it came to the penalty shootout against @entity163 in the second round			1
he closed his eyes when he belted out the national anthem and all his dreams came true when he converted @entity2 ’s corner in the seventh minute			0
it would be impossible to do justice to the noise inside the stadium and the celebrations that followed down by the corner flag			0
in : @entity103 gives @entity0 the lead against @entity25 as they got on their way to the @entity1 's last four strike : @entity103 was under pressure , scrutinised like never before after opting out of taking a penalty thankful : @entity103 closed his eyes when he belted out the national anthem and was pivotal on the pitch there was a constant buzz around the stadium , a unique blend of anticipation and fear that you get when your exam results arrive			1
just what if @entity25 got their act together ? they could n't cope			0
@entity107 , the star of the tournament with six goals now , was kicked out of it in the first half			2
he was fouled four times before the break and @entity202 , @entity25 ’s other danger - man , three			2
@entity0 ’s hatchet men had done a number on him			0
@entity205 nailed him early and then it was a carousel of @entity0 players waiting to have a crack at the @entity25 forward			1
it was a difficult evening for @entity107 , particularly after his name was booed by @entity0 ’s supporters when his name was read out before the game			1
this was @entity0 showing their teeth , crashing into tackles to make sure they made it to the semi-final in @entity221			2
until then , this place is one big party			0
upset : @entity107 shows his hurt after @entity25 was dumped out of the @entity1 gutted : @entity25 coach @entity225 comforts @entity107 after the 2 - 1 defeat			1
