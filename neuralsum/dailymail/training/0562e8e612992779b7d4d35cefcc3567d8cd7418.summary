@entity1 ’s shock move from @entity2 to @entity3 was in danger of collapsing on tuesday night amid a club versus country stand - off over the payment of a transfer fee			1
the 29 - year - old flanker had appeared to be on the verge of a sensational and immediate return to the @entity12 in order to push for a place in @entity17 ’s @entity16 squad , as @entity3 attempted to hurriedly finalise a season - long deal			1
however , after the initial @entity21 deadline for registering players passed at noon , the @entity5 ’s head coach @entity19 suggested that the deal was close to being ‘ dead in the water ’			1
@entity2 flanker @entity1 had been linked with a shock move to @entity3 but he will not return to @entity17 @entity3 coach @entity19 ( right ) says @entity1 ( left , pictured playing for @entity17 in 2010 ) will not be signed by the @entity5 if he features for @entity26 side @entity2 in @entity21 this weekend as is expected if @entity1 plays for @entity2 against @entity27 in the opening round of the new @entity29 on sunday , he will be cup - tied and unavailable to represent @entity3 in @entity21 matches , at which point their pursuit of the openside will end			1
for now , it is thought that talks are on - going , but the sticking point appears to be the payment of a £ 300,000 fee to @entity2			2
there are striking similarities between this case and that of @entity42 in the build - up to confirmation of his cross-code move to @entity3 earlier this year			1
@entity47 understands that the @entity17 management have privately welcomed the notion of @entity1 returning to play in this country , which would mean he is once again eligible for @entity53 selection dialogue has taken place between the men running the national set - up and their counterparts at @entity3			1
the club are believed to be seeking financial input from the @entity61 on the basis that @entity17 stand to benefit from having renewed access to @entity1			1
however , as was the situation with the deal for @entity42 , the union are adamant that they can not have any direct involvement			0
@entity68 claimed in an interview that ‘ the @entity61 were trying to do the deal ’ , while initial reports in @entity26 suggested that officials from the union had made contact with @entity2 about a potential release agreement			1
but a source at @entity77 was adamant that the union ’s chief executive @entity78 has merely been kept informed about developments by his opposite number at @entity3 , @entity82 , adding : ‘ we have n’t talked to @entity2			2
’ @entity17 coach @entity84 refuses to pick overseas - based players because of @entity61 policy @entity1 played in the @entity12 for @entity87 before upping sticks and moving to @entity26 with @entity2 the @entity61 are well aware that any financial contribution would be seized upon by @entity3 ’s @entity12 rivals as favouritism and would undermine the integrity of the league			1
@entity78 is said to be absolutely adamant that a line can not be crossed , even if it leads to long - term benefits for @entity17			2
so , despite the apparent will on all sides for the transfer to go through , it had reached an impasse on tuesday night			0
@entity1 ’s hopes of forcing his way back into @entity16 contention and adding to his tally of five test caps were hanging by a thread			2
he had recently considered using a loophole in the eligibility criteria to switch @entity53 allegiance to @entity26 , but he has had an abrupt change of heart			0
@entity3 are pursuing @entity1 as a replacement for their injured @entity113 flanker , @entity112 , but @entity19 said : ‘ we have n’t signed him			1
we tried to and we have the ability to do so with our injury dispensation			0
‘ we ’ve been looking around for a while and our owner , @entity118 , thought of @entity1			2
we tried to make it happen and it was very , very close			0
@entity121 was excited to come here but it ’s just not been done			0
‘ i understand there were financial reasons			0
it ’s unfortunate , because we were so close to signing a great player , who could have helped club and country			0
‘ the @entity61 were trying to do the deal and @entity118 has been dealing with that			0
from my point of view , if he plays for @entity2 in the @entity29 this weekend then i would be stupid to sign him because then he ca n’t play for us in @entity21			1
if that happens then it ’s dead in the water			0
’ asked if that appeared likely , @entity19 added : ‘ at this moment in time , yeah			2
’ @entity1 , playing for @entity17 , moves past the tackle of @entity141 winger @entity140 in 2010 the @entity2 flanker ( centre ) is expected to play in @entity21 this weekend , meaning he will not move to @entity3 @entity3 have emerged as title contenders in the early stages of this season — playing a daring brand of rugby based on predominantly @entity150 talent			1
@entity19 believes @entity1 , the current @entity151 , could fit into his side well , as well as the @entity17 squad , and lamented the fact that he might not have the chance to do so			1
he would have been a fantastic signing for @entity3 , ’ @entity19 told @entity157			1
‘ i spoke to @entity121 myself and over the weekend			0
he just wanted to come and play for @entity3 and have a shot at the @entity16 , so i feel sorry for him that it ’s not happened			2
' what he ’s done in the last few years has been brilliant and he is a world - class player			0
i think it would have been great for @entity17 as well , with a @entity16 around the corner , for @entity84 to be able to pick a player of that potential			0
’ early reports in @entity26 claimed that @entity168 were also interested in signing @entity1 , but that was flatly denied by their director of rugby @entity170			2
he said : ‘ we were n’t involved and we wo n’t be involved			0
we are very happy with the back - row resources we have here			0
’ if there is to be another twist in this tale and a deal is eventually done , @entity1 — a specialist openside poacher — could soon be a prime challenger for @entity181 ’s @entity53 place , but the @entity17 captain appeared to relish the personal competition			1
‘ i played against @entity1 quite a bit in schoolboy rugby so we crossed paths quite a bit and had quite a few good battles , ’ he said			0
‘ he is a cracking player and if you look at what he has won in the last few previous years , it is pretty special			0
’ he has won countless personal awards and team prizes with @entity2 , but what @entity1 really craves is a shot at @entity16 selection			1
it appears to be a fading fantasy			0
@entity1 , the 2013 - 14 @entity21 player of the year , playing for @entity2 in @entity200 final against @entity168 the flanker , pictured here at @entity77 in 2013 , wants to return to play for @entity17 at international level			1

@entity1 must play in @entity17 to be eligible for national selection
the 29 - year - old is the current @entity151
@entity3 had made ' *urgent* *enquiries* ' about signing the forward immediately
if @entity1 features for @entity2 in @entity21 this weekend against @entity27 then @entity3 will not pursue a deal for him during this season
but @entity1 could still make the move if he does not play this weekend
@entity3 head coach @entity19 says move ' has not been done '
