the orthodox jewish tradition known as oral suction circumcision reaches back to biblical times but it has created a modern - day dilemma for @entity5 health officials , who have linked it to 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000			1
two died and two others suffered brain damage			0
mayor @entity12 's administration , which came into power a year ago with a promise to reconsider an existing regulation on the ritual , is now negotiating with a group of rabbis over how to protect children 's health while still preserving religious freedom			1
' the talks are ongoing but i can not go into particulars , ' said @entity25 , the mayor 's deputy director of intergovernmental affairs who has been leading the talks			1
' our goal is to achieve awareness of the risks			0
' tradition : @entity35 is handed a scalpel during the bris , or ritual circumcision , of @entity39 in @entity5			2
officials in the city are negotiating with @entity42 over oral - circumcision , which has been linked to 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000 such oral suction circumcisions are relatively rare , even in @entity5 , which is home to more than a million @entity47 — the largest @entity47 population outside @entity49			1
city health officials estimate more than 3,000 babies are circumcised each year using the oral suction method — formally called metzitzah b'peh in @entity54			1
a 2012 report by the federal @entity56 advised against the practice , saying it increases the risk of herpes infection in baby boys by 3.4 times that of other male newborns			1
oral suction circumcisions first came under scrutiny during mayor @entity67 's administration , and the city 's health board voted in 2012 to regulate the practice by asking a parent or guardian to sign a consent form indicating possible risks			1
health officials point to a number of factors they say have linked the known cases to the ritual			1
they look for lesions on the genitalia , indicating that 's where the virus started			2
in addition , lab tests have showed that the timing of the infection coincides with the circumcision			0
two cases were recorded after oral suction in 2013 and four last year			1
in the most recent case , diagnosed in november , a baby boy was found to have lesions on his penis			0
but of those six cases , parents refused to identify the person who performed the circumcision — called a mohel — in four			2
precaution : @entity35 uses mouthwash as an antiseptic before performing a bris			0
mayor @entity12 's administration is negotiating a medical protocol following concern over the practice in the two cases in which the circumcisers were identified , both declined to be tested , the @entity108 said			1
they were banned from performing the ritual			0
the consent forms remain the regulatory standard for now , but most @entity115 rabbis have told their faithful not to comply , and the city acknowledges it does not collect them unless there is suspicion of herpes			2
@entity35 , an 85 - year - old @entity120 survivor and native of what today is called @entity123 , is chairman of the @entity124 , which has certified 90 mohels , says he doubts the oral suction method had anything to do with spreading herpes			1
@entity35 believes the infants may have been infected by the mother or another source			0
' they 're wild accusations without any basis , ' @entity35 said			0
' i 've done 35,000 circumcisions and never had an infection , of any kind			0
' the rabbi does warn parents that circumcision , in general , has its risks , just like any medical procedure			0
his association mandates herpes testing and rinsing with mouthwash before the ceremony , in addition to scrubbing and sterilizing hands			2
the rabbi followed those precautions one morning at @entity153 's @entity152 , where he circumcised week - old @entity39			1
@entity35 first administered a topical anesthetic , wrapping gauze around the child 's legs to isolate the sterilized area			2
then the baby , on a white pillow , was carried into the main worship space			0
invited guests watched as @entity35 did what he 's done thousands of other times			1
concerns : the rabbi does warn parents that circumcision , in general , has its risks , just like any medical procedure ' he 's the best mohel in @entity5 , ' says the boy 's mother , @entity173			2
' we chose him because we trust him			0
' while @entity5 wrestles with the issue , suburban @entity177 — itself home to thousands of @entity42 — seems to have found a solution			0
for any suspected case after circumcision , county health officials use dna testing to try to link a baby with the source of infection			1
since the county introduced the protocol in 2013 , three infant boys were diagnosed with herpes ; the dna of two mohels did not match the boys ' and the third test was inconclusive			1
members of the jewish community participate voluntarily in the process , working with dr. @entity197 , @entity177 's director of epidemiology			0
' that proves that they trust us , ' @entity197 said			0
' we have cooperation , along with a scientific approach			0

health officials say 17 cases of infant herpes since 2000 have been linked to the tradition , which dates back to biblical times
around 3,000 babies are circumcised using the method every year
@entity12 's administration is now trying to negotiate a *compromise*
@entity216 would aim to preserve religious freedom while protecting health
a 2012 report by the @entity56 advised against the practice
