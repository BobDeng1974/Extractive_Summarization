by @entity0 published : 10:14 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:19 est , 1 february 2014 if the mere thought of re-painting the windows or front door of your home fills you with dread , spare a thought for airlines who have to spruce up their planes			0
but for them time really can fly			0
for with the help of time - lapse photography , airline @entity13 has compressed into just two minutes the near fortnight - long round - the - clock marathon required to strip and re-paint each of its @entity20 passenger aircraft			1
scroll down to watch the video huge : a timelapse video shows how @entity13 workers in a hangar in @entity25 repaint the airline 's planes job : the workers begin by stripping the plane 's entire coat of paint off in preparation for repainting work in progress : the plane after the start of the process , with stripped paint on the floor @entity13 runs the world ’s largest aircraft paint hangar owned by an airline			1
last year it completed 21 aircraft ‘ make - overs ’ , each one averaging around 312 hours or about 13 days and nights			2
the @entity13 paint hangar at @entity47 is more than twice the size of a football pitch			1
a @entity20 requires a team of 26 to 30 people for a full strip - and - repaint project , which is turned around in 12 to 13 days in the hangar which operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week			1
half - way : the plane has lost most of its paint by this point as the work continues around the clock bare : the @entity20 pictured completely denuded of its paint ready for a new coat first steps : the white base layer is the first coat of paint to be applied to the plane temperature , humidity and airflow have to be regulated to ensure a perfect glossy coat			1
@entity68 , executive vice president and chief operations officer of @entity13 , said : ‘ it ’s not just about looking good			2
' the paint coat has to withstand fierce weather conditions , including severe wind , bitter cold and searing heat , and an exterior coat that is clean of debris and imperfections improves aerodynamics and reduces fuel consumption			0
‘ @entity13 already flies a young and efficient fleet , but with fuel prices at consistently high levels , every little bit of efficiency counts			0
’ stencil : next the name of the airline is reapplied to the @entity20 jet by workers nearly done : the painting crew put the finishing touches to the plane as they work on the door finally ! after 13 days of work , the gleaming 777 is ready to go back into service he added : ‘ our aircraft livery is one of the most recognisable and visible aspects of our brand			2
it is what people see in the sky , and the first thing our passengers see at their boarding gates			0
‘ we take pride in maintaining our aircraft to the highest possible standards , and it is important our planes look pristine on the outside as well as on the inside			0
’ the @entity25 - based carrier strips its aircraft of their exterior colour and gives them a brand - new coat after every seven to eight years in service			1
it has 132 @entity20 777s , one of which is featured in the video , with 201 more on order .			0
