by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 19:48 est , 14 november 2013 @entity1 was yesterday rocked by the news that its troubled economy slammed into reverse over the summer			1
official figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between july and september - leaving the country on the brink of another recession			1
the dismal news came just a week after @entity13 ’s cut @entity1 ’s credit rating by a further notch to @entity15 in a humiliating setback for president @entity17			1
humiliating : official figures showed output fell by 0.1 per cent between july and september in another set back for @entity17 the performance in the rest of the eurozone was little better with output in the single currency bloc growing by just 0.1pc in the third quarter down from 0.3pc in the previous three months			1
the @entity26 economy slowed from 0.7 per cent to just 0.3 per cent			0
figures from @entity28 showed its economy shrank by 0.1pc following a 0.3pc contraction in the second quarter			2
but @entity33 notched up growth of 0.1 per cent - its first quarter of expansion since early 2011			0
the disappointing figures from the across the region were a stark reminder that the eurozone crisis is far from over and fuelled fears of a long and painful recovery			0
it was also in stark contrast to the @entity45 where the economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of the year			1
@entity49 governor @entity48 this week said the ‘ glass is half full ’ in @entity45 and hailed ‘ one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world ’			0
optimism : @entity49 governor @entity48 this week said the ' glass is half full ' in @entity45 and hailed ' one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world ' it came as figures showed unemployment in the @entity45 has fallen to 7.6 per cent and a record of nearly 30m people are in work			1
unemployment in the eurozone is at a record high of over 12 per cent and more than half of @entity33 and @entity71 youngsters who want a job can not find work			0
@entity74 , chief @entity75 economist at @entity76 , said : ‘ the near - stagnation of the eurozone economy in the third quarter underlines the fragility of the recovery and the growing dangers of a damaging bout of deflation in the region			0
’ the @entity86 last week cut interest rates from 0.5 per cent to a new record low of 0.25 per cent in a desperate bid to stave of deflation and inject life into the economy			2
but with @entity26 , the eurozone ’s biggest economy , slowing and @entity1 , the second biggest , in decline , experts fear the move was too little too late			2
analysts said the renewed slump in @entity1 , following growth of 0.5 per cent in the second quarter , is particularly alarming and piles pressure on @entity17 and his socialist government			0
it also made a mockery of @entity17 ’s claim in august that ‘ the recovery is here ’			0
in a devastating analysis last week , @entity13 highlighted the risks to the @entity1 economy posed by weak economic growth , high unemployment , the rising national debt and ‘ elevated ’ levels of tax and spending			1
the latest downgrade – which could push up @entity1 borrowing costs as investors worry about the country ’s credit - worthiness – came less than two years after @entity1 was stripped of its top - notch aaa rating and sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone			1
@entity1 unemployment is at a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3m in september and more than a quarter of under - 25s who want a job can not find work .			2
