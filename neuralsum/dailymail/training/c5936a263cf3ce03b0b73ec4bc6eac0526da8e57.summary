@entity1 may end up paying hundreds of millions in extra cash to @entity3 , @entity0 admitted yesterday , after a senior @entity5 official warned refusal to pay would threaten our rebate			1
the prime minister told mps he will never pay ‘ anything like ’ the £ 1.7billion demanded by the @entity11 , while mps said he should tell the @entity5 to ‘ stick ’ their bill			1
however it seems the @entity1 will almost certainly be forced to pay something extra after the @entity11 suggested it could withhold our £ 3billion - a - year rebate			2
despite his combative stance in the @entity27 , the prime minister appeared to shift his position by saying it was the ‘ scale ’ of the cash demand that was unjustified			1
he said @entity32 officials would ‘ crawl ’ through all the @entity5 ’s figures to ensure @entity1 was being asked to pay the right amount			1
but he had to fend off criticism that he should have known long before last thursday that we might be facing such a huge cash demand			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity1 will not be paying 2billion euros to anyone on december 1 and we reject this scale of payment			2
we will be challenging this			2
’ but later a spokesman said that in the past , @entity1 had been happy to pay sums of ‘ the low hundreds of millions ’ – indicating that the @entity1 may end up paying a similar amount this time			2
the prime minister was accused of being ‘ asleep at the wheel ’ by @entity46			1
he claimed the @entity48 had been working on the changes since 2012 and publicly stated in may that they would impact on the @entity1 ’s contribution , while then - treasury minister @entity52 said in march that the @entity53 was giving ‘ high priority ’ to addressing them			2
and @entity56 @entity57 mp @entity56 also cast doubt on the prime minister ’s claim that the demand took the government by surprise , telling mps that the @entity65 and @entity32 must have known for at least five months that it was on its way			1
jab : @entity46 accused the pm of being ‘ asleep at the wheel ’ , pointing out the @entity48 had been working on the changes since 2012 and stated in may they would affect the @entity1 ’s contribution in another blow for mr @entity0 , it emerged that the @entity73 – which has also been hit with a @entity3 cash demand – said they would probably pay up			1
yesterday the @entity76 finance minister undermined the prime minister ’s hopes of getting powers over our borders back from @entity3 – saying any change to the principle of free movement of workers was ‘ unthinkable ’			0
support for @entity87 hit a new high after the @entity5 ’s budget demand , a poll last night suggested			1
backing for @entity87 jumped four points to 19 per cent – one point above its previous high in june			0
@entity94 slumped five points to 30 per cent – the party ’s lowest rating under @entity46 – leaving it level with the conservatives , the @entity100 poll for @entity101 showed			1
and mr @entity0 ’s insistence that @entity1 will not pay the full £ 1.7billion was met with scepticism from the @entity5 ’s budget commissioner , @entity104			1
mr @entity104 said it would be ‘ extremely difficult ’ for the @entity1 to challenge the demand , as this would need the support of a qualified majority of member states			2
he added that any refusal to pay the bill would open a ‘ @entity112 ’ which could put the future of the @entity1 ’s @entity5 rebate on the negotiating table			1
mr @entity104 said he was ‘ surprised ’ by the prime minister ’s anger , insisting that the adjustment of @entity1 ’s contribution was a routine annual procedure			0
he claimed that the figures behind the calculation were provided by the @entity48 , and the @entity1 was informed on october 17 of the scale of the surcharge			0
@entity1 had had two opportunities to challenge the way the figure would be calculated			0
and he warned that @entity1 would be liable for ‘ late payment fines ’ if it failed to hand over the cash on time			0
responding to mr @entity104 , mr @entity0 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the rebate is not on the table			0
’ the controversial @entity136 @entity135 system must be retained by @entity1 to ‘ keep our country safe ’ , @entity0 said last night			0
the prime minister ’s comments appeared to give strong backing to home secretary @entity142 , who warned opting out of the scheme could turn @entity1 into a ‘ honeypot ’ for criminals			0
but the party leadership still faces the prospect of a rebellion by dozens of backbench @entity57 mps who oppose the warrant			0
the legislation allows @entity5 citizens to be fast - tracked to other member states for trial and applies to crimes carrying a maximum sentence of 12 months or more			1
critics say it is a blunt tool which undermines civil liberties and is abused by law enforcement agencies in countries which lack @entity1 legal protections			0
many also point to the case of five - year - old @entity165 , whose parents were subject to a warrant after they sought treatment for his brain tumour abroad			0
but supporters say opting out would lead serious criminals to view @entity1 as a safe haven			0
responding to questions from mps over whether @entity1 should remain in the system , the prime minister said : ‘ what matters most of all is that we give the police and the security services the powers they need to keep our country safe			0

despite combative stance , @entity173 *softened* his criticism of the @entity5 demand
@entity46 and @entity56 cast doubt on @entity173 's claim that it was a surprise
@entity5 budget commissioner says failure to pay full bill would risk future rebates
