she was accused of having an affair with a senior officer and told she could not work with another woman because they would need to go to the toilet together			2
colleagues also hid a stash of hardcore pornography in a cabinet for her to discover during a training exercise			2
and at the end of a recruitment day , a training inspector asked the officer , who for legal reasons can only be named as miss m : ' would you like me to get you some pink guns ? ' an employment tribunal found there was a ' culture of discrimination ' in her team at @entity2			1
it ruled that senior officers failed to investigate her complaints properly and said the claims about the affair were ' salacious and unsubstantiated '			1
miss m , who remains a police officer , said the abuse damaged her career and left her tearful and unable to sleep			1
she complained three times in 2010 , before making an official complaint in january 2011 , when she was kicked out of the firearms unit			2
at the tribunal in @entity49 , miss m 's lawyer , @entity50 , accused the force of a ' cover - up ' and said a senior officer had sided with ' the lads ' , leaving his client isolated			1
' it is unfortunate that in the 21st century , discrimination of this kind can still take place in the police force , ' mr @entity50 said after the hearing			0
the tribunal panel ruled in favour of miss m on three counts of sex discrimination and handed her the five - figure sum			0
of this , £ 5,000 was for the ' unsubstantiated ' claim about the affair that was repeated during the tribunal			0
four other allegations of sex discrimination were not proved			0

' these have been assessed as being in the middle band of the amounts set out in the law for compensation for injury to feelings in cases of this kind			0
' we take on board the tribunal 's additional award for extra distress caused , in the main , by the officer 's original complaints not having been investigated as quickly as they ought to have been			1
miss @entity97 completed her training as an authorised firearms officer in 2006			1
between 2006 and 2010 she would periodically attend courses run by the @entity101 ' the force does not intend to appeal against the tribunal 's awards			0

' the county 's police and crime commissioner , @entity118 , said : ' this was clearly a distressing case for the officer , and it is right she has been awarded damages			0
' we must now focus on the lessons we have learned and improve the support for officers who make complaints			2
