@entity0 has published the names of men who allegedly gang - raped a cheerleader at a party 12 years ago - after she turned to the hacking group for help following the @entity9 case			1
@entity10 , 26 , contacted the group after returning to @entity12 , @entity13 , where she was raped when she was 14 , with the intention of gathering evidence from her case - and discovering the sheriff 's department no longer had it			1
fearing that authorities in the close - knit community were failing to help her chase her alleged attackers , she contacted @entity0 after reading that they had helped bring the @entity9 case to national attention			1
that case , in which two students were prosecuted in a close - knit @entity13 community after @entity0 leaked videos and photographs of the attack , was similar to her own , she said			1
now with the help of @entity0 , police have re-opened the case			1
but she told @entity33 that , due to problems working with authorities in @entity12 , she is uncertain if she will ever see a conviction			1
fighting back : @entity10 , pictured with her fiance @entity37 , is seeking justice 12 years after she was gang - raped as a high school freshman			1
she is seeking help from hacking group @entity0 ' i do not think there is a chance i will see any of those guys convicted , ' she said			2
' there is n't evidence because it 's been discarded or destroyed			2
but i 'm coming forward because this is about authorities being held accountable			1
' @entity49 said that the horrific attack unfolded as she attended her first high school party at a remote hunting cabin with her boyfriend when she was a high school freshman			1
when her boyfriend wanted to leave , she decided to stay and agreed to get a ride back with someone else			2
when he left , someone handed her a @entity59 drink and after drinking it , she told @entity61 that her limbs began to go limp and she lost the ability to talk			2
she said she remembers being locked inside a room with five boys before they began passing her around , grabbing her			0
she said three raped her - while she could do nothing to stop them			0
after one of the boys drove her home the next morning , she told her parents about the attack and they took her to the local hospital where she took a rape test			1
strong : she said she is still haunted by the rape but said she was unable to deal with the investigation as a teen records show the hospital contacted the @entity79			1
she said she was too scared at the time to tell authorities the names of her alleged attackers			1
when she returned to school , rumors began that she had made up the rape story so that people did not call her a slut for having sex with the boys , and when deputies started interviewing students , she said she received threats			1
eventually she moved to @entity94 to live with her father			0
@entity0 played a central role in the @entity9 rape case			1
two football stars @entity99 , 17 , and @entity100 , 16 , were convicted of the rape in march			0
they were sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with a maximum stay until they are 21			0
the case emerged after @entity9 football players made fun of the 16 - year - old victim , who was passed around and raped in august 2012 , by spreading videos and pictures of her			1
an @entity0 hacker , known as @entity113 and now revealed as security consultant @entity114 , 26 , was responsible for publicizing these videos and images			1
they inspired greater public interest in the case			1
in december , hackers with @entity0 and @entity121 posted a video on a fan site for the @entity9 football team , threatening to release personal information of those involved in the @entity9 rape case if they did not come forward and apologize			1
the @entity128 is now investigating @entity114 for his role			0
in a bizarre twist , if convicted of any hacking - related crimes , @entity114 faces up to 10 years in federal prison - nine more years than the minimum sentence for the convicted @entity9 rapists			0
in april , @entity0 vowed to expose the identities of four boys who raped a 17 - year - old girl who subsequently killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault			0
the hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed culprits were and that they were confirming the identity of a third before putting them on the @entity144			0
in a post the group added that it was ‘ only a matter ’ of time before they got the fourth as well			0
@entity151 , 17 , hanged herself in her family 's bathroom in @entity154 , @entity155 , two months ago after being relentlessly tormented			0
she said the sheriff 's department eventually dropped the case , saying they did not know where the assault had taken place and did not have any names for alleged attackers			1
when @entity49 read the story about the rape in @entity9 , in which an incapacitated 16 - year - old girl was passed around athletes in august 2012 , she said she saw similarities with her own case			1
when she contacted @entity171 about running her story in the wake of @entity9 , a journalist encouraged her to gather as much of the evidence from her case as she could			2
she returned to the hospital and collected her medical records , which noted she had been the victim of a sexual assault and had been referred to @entity79			2
but when she went to the department , they had no record of her investigation and no longer had the clothes she had been wearing the night of the attack , she said			1
she also discovered that her rape kit was no longer stored and she was eventually told it had been destroyed in an ' act of vandalism ' when a fridge had been knocked over , she said			0
she said she also learned deputies had compiled a list containing ' six or seven ' names during their initial investigation			2
when asked why authorities would fail to help her , @entity49 said : ' i 've asked myself that			2
it 's a stereotypical @entity197 , @entity13 town			1
football rules , wrestling rules			0
they were wrestling stars and with that comes entitlement			0
' she added that while it is one thing that the case was mishandled in the past , it is another that she believes the case continues to be mishandled			2
' in my mind it 's in your interest to find what the problems are [ with your law enforcement ] , ' she said			2
' you can be an example of a small town that has recognized its errors and taken a strong stance to change it - because you respect your mothers and your sisters and your daughters			0
' the couple decided to make a plea on the private page of @entity226 , an @entity0 - affiliated website set up after @entity9			0
they included names and contacts of her attackers			0
within hours , they started talking to a member with the screen name @entity236 , who then re-posted the information to his public website			0
attack : the victim of the @entity9 rape case is pictured in a photo that was shared on social networks while the couple were shocked he had published this sensitive information , they were overjoyed when @entity249 detective @entity248 contacted @entity236 on @entity250 ' i would like to speak to you , or the person with the new information , so that we might further investigate the case and bring the perpetrator ( s ) to justice , ' the detective said			1
a week later , @entity248 traveled to @entity94 to interview @entity49 and let her know that the department had reopened her case			2
but @entity248 was worried about @entity236 's website and feared the alleged attackers could read the information and use it to craft an alibi			0
when the couple contacted @entity236 , he said he had forgotten the password to remove the information			0
authorities told @entity61 that there were problems with the case - thanks to this public information and because of the lack of kept evidence			1
convicted : @entity99 , 17 , left , and @entity100 , 16 , were convicted of raping the girl last year ' we do n't want to jeopardize an investigation , ' @entity249 chief deputy @entity277 said			2
' but she 's called some people before we even had a chance to interview any suspects			0
' the department failed to return a request from @entity33 seeking comment			0
@entity49 has also received help from the attorney general 's office but when representatives went to the sheriff 's department to offer assistance , it was declined , she said			0
refusing to give up , she contacted her congressman and the sheriff has now accepted the attorney general 's help , @entity49 said			0
' that was a huge victory at the time , ' she said			0
' now we get our case investigated by someone who is independent of the county			2
' hackers : help from @entity0 has had mixed results but police have now re-opened the case @entity49 said she now hopes to work with legislatures to improve objective investigations for the victims of sexual abuse			1
she accepts she might not get the justice she craves because of the lack of evidence			2
but she hopes to add to the pressure on law enforcement to take rape cases seriously			0
she said she was not equipped to deal with the attack when she was so young , but now she is willing to fight as hard as she can for justice			1
' i am more stable and can revisit it without it crippling me , ' she said .			0

@entity10 , 26 , says she is still haunted by the attack in @entity12 , @entity13 which occurred when she was 14
pursuit of justice has been wrought with problems ; when she returned to the police , they had no record of their investigation
' this case is about holding the authorities accountable '
