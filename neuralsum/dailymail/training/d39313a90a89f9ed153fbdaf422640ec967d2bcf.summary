she spared no expense in arranging a private cremation , believing that £ 920 was a small price to pay to have her loyal companion ’s body treated with respect			2
but a few weeks later , the company she had entrusted with the sensitive task handed her a container just 18 inches long and containing only a heap of ashes weighing 11lb			0
@entity20 @entity19 , 69 , pictured left , was caught out rendering horses instead of getting them cremated when he sent @entity1 , right , the remain of her thoroughbred in a dog casket suspicions : horse owner @entity1 , 40 , knew something was wrong when the ashes of her thoroughbred were returned in a tiny box , right , that was much smaller than the normal size expected for a cremated horse , pictured left distraught : the mother - of - two , pictured riding @entity3 on the right , from @entity36 , near @entity37 , contacted authorities when she realised the casket was too small for her 16.3hh ( 5 ' 7 " ) horse mrs @entity1 immediately suspected that the remains could not be those of @entity3 , who had stood at a muscular 16.3 hands high ( 5ft 7in ) and weighed around 1,000lb			1
her worst fears were finally confirmed when it emerged that the man to whom she entrusted her thoroughbred ’s remains had simply dumped them in a knacker ’s yard – where they were turned into fertiliser and glue			0
the ashes she was given are thought to have belonged to an unidentified dog			0
mrs @entity1 said she was ‘ sickened ’ when she learned the truth			1
following the discovery , trading standards launched an investigation into @entity19 , to whom she had entrusted @entity3 ’s body			1
they have since found as many as 31 grieving horse lovers had been duped by @entity19 , 69 , who made around £ 500 profit on each ‘ cremation ’			1
instead of giving them a private burial , he dumped the horses with dozens of other animal carcasses and took them to a rendering plant , where he paid £ 40 to have them made into glue and fertiliser			2
duped : @entity19 was contracted to cremate horses by veterinary surgery @entity75 , used by @entity77 , which had no idea he was not honouring the agreement fitting send - off : @entity1 , pictured with thoroughbred @entity3 , paid £ 920 to have a private cremation for her beloved horse @entity20 @entity19 , 69 , instead took the horse to a rendering plant where he paid £ 40 to have it made into glue and fertiliser the fees he charged varied			1
some of the money he charged went to veterinary practices with whom he had contracts – and who were not aware of his methods			0
the fraudster has now been ordered to pay compensation to his victims and was given an eight - month suspended prison sentence			1
yesterday mrs @entity1 , a mother of two , said she was referred to @entity19 after discussing her wishes with a vet after @entity3 died in january 2009			1
after a delay in the ashes being returned to her , she had been horrified to discover that @entity3 had been taken to a location in @entity103 which does not have a crematorium , only a rendering plant			0
mrs @entity1 , from @entity36 , @entity106 , looked after @entity3 for two years after he retired as a riding horse			1
‘ he was a part of our family , a special horse , ’ she said			0
‘ i was absolutely gutted that @entity3 had died , but believed he would be getting the send - off i wanted			0
’ she continued : ‘ the girl at the vets was shaking as she handed over the casket			0
i got it home and it was just tiny with a small amount of bone and ash inside			0
’ she later learned that the box she was given was four times smaller than a horse casket			2
@entity19 , from @entity123 , was first prosecuted in 2011 after admitting cheating five women by pretending their horses would be cremated individually			2
a further 26 victims then came forward after the case was publicised			0
last week he appeared at @entity128 to admit fraud			0
@entity131 , prosecuting for @entity106 trading standards department , said @entity19 had fraudulently obtained £ 14,393 from the 26 new cases			1
