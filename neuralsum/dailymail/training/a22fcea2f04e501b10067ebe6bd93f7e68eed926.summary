the cold waters of @entity2 's deep ocean have not warmed measurably since 2005 , according to a new @entity4 study			1
researchers say that while the find does not throw suspicion on global warming , it is a mystery			0
they say it cold be related to the fact global warming appears to have slowed in recent years			0
although the temperature of the ocean 's top half continues to rise , the bottom half has not warmed measurably in the last decade , researchers say - although they claims these findings do not throw suspicion on climate change itself			1
in the 21st century , greenhouse gases have continued to accumulate in the atmosphere , just as they did in the 20th century , but global average surface air temperatures have stopped rising in tandem with the gases			0
the temperature of the top half of the world 's ocean -- above the 1.24 - mile mark -- is still climbing , but not fast enough to account for the stalled air temperatures			1
many processes on land , air and sea have been invoked to explain what is happening to the ' missing ' heat			0
one of the most prominent ideas is that the bottom half of the ocean is taking up the slack , but supporting evidence is slim			1
this latest study is the first to test the idea using satellite observations , as well as direct temperature measurements of the upper ocean			1
scientists have been taking the temperature of the top half of the ocean directly since 2005 , using a network of 3,000 floating temperature probes called the @entity53 array			1
scientists at @entity4 's @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , analyzed satellite and direct ocean temperature data from 2005 to 2013 and found the ocean abyss below 1.24 miles ( 1,995 meters ) has not warmed measurably			1
study coauthor @entity61 of @entity55 said these findings do not throw suspicion on climate change itself			0
' the sea level is still rising , ' @entity61 noted			0
' we 're just trying to understand the nitty - gritty details			2

' the deep parts of the ocean are harder to measure , ' said @entity55 's @entity104 , lead author of the study , published sunday , oct. 5 in the journal @entity107			2
' the combination of satellite and direct temperature data gives us a glimpse of how much sea level rise is due to deep warming			2
' the answer is - not much			2
' the study took advantage of the fact that water expands as it gets warmer			0
the sea level is rising because of this expansion and water added by glacier and ice sheet melt			0
to arrive at their conclusion , the @entity55 scientists did a straightforward subtraction calculation , using data for 2005 to 2013 from the @entity53 buoys , @entity4 's @entity131 and @entity132 satellites , and the agency 's @entity134 ( @entity134 ) satellites			2
from the total amount of sea level rise , they subtracted the amount of rise from the expansion in the upper ocean , and the amount of rise that came from added meltwater			0
the remainder represented the amount of sea level rise caused by warming in the deep ocean			0
the remainder was essentially zero			0
@entity2 's @entity149 has not warmed anemones			2
although the temperature of the ocean 's top half continues to rise deep sea creatures , like these anemones at a hydrothermal vent , are not yet feeling the heat from global climate change			1
deep ocean warming contributed virtually nothing to sea level rise during this period			0
coauthor @entity162 of @entity55 noted that during the same period , warming in the top half of the ocean continued unabated , an unequivocal sign that our planet is heating up			1
some recent studies reporting deep - ocean warming were , in fact , referring to the warming in the upper half of the ocean but below the topmost layer , which ends about 0.4 mile ( 700 meters ) down			1
@entity162 also is a coauthor of another paper in the same @entity107 journal issue on ocean warming in the @entity178 from 1970 to 2005			0
before @entity53 floats were deployed , temperature measurements in the @entity180 were spotty , at best			1
using satellite measurements and climate simulations of sea level changes around the world , the new study found the global ocean absorbed far more heat in those 35 years than previously thought - a whopping 24 to 58 percent more than early estimates .			1

the temperature of the top half of the world 's ocean above the 1.24 - mile mark is still climbing
@entity180 abyss below 1.24 miles ( 1,995 meters ) has not warmed measurably
