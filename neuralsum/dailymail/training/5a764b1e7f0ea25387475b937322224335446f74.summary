by @entity0 he might be a keen diver in his own right but even usually relaxed prince @entity3 looked nervous when confronted with a giant lobster during a visit to @entity6 today			0
as one of the local fisherman swung round , his catch in his hands , the prince gamely stepped up to inspect the crustacean , which had been pulled out of a lobster pot just ahead of the royal visit			0
the prince met the men in his role as a supporter of @entity17 and of @entity18 ; an initiative aimed at encouraging young people to choose fishing as a career			1
like other @entity34 initiatives , get @entity40 focuses on giving local unemployed young people the skills , qualifications and training they needed to get into the fishing industry			1
among recent graduates is the crack lobster catcher , who along with a friend runs a stall on @entity28 â€™s fish market , while another alumnus works on a trawler out of @entity55 harbour			2
later , prince @entity3 was joined by the @entity56 who had spent the morning touring the shops in @entity28 , among them a fishmonger and a grocer specialising in local produce			1
success : prince @entity3 met graduates of the @entity34 's @entity64 scheme for unemployed youths tasty ! the @entity56 had a foodie experience of her own and toured local shops and met producers like her husband , @entity70 found herself on the receiving end of some animal attention , although in her case , it came in the shape of a pair of cuddly corgis			1
much to their owner 's delight , the animal - loving @entity56 bent down to give the excited dogs a pat before rejoining her husband for a visit to the local @entity86 station			1
there , the royal couple were shown around the purpose - built facility , which opened in 2003 and houses two lifeboats , before being whisked off to tour the local market			2
clotted cream fudge , @entity6 pasties and a sliver of local cheddar were all on the menu as @entity3 and @entity70 made their way past stallholders , all eager to give the royal visitors a taste of @entity6			0
@entity70 , who was elegant in a butterfly print cream dress and matching jacket , even found time to tuck into another @entity6 classic - a scone topped with clotted cream and jam			0
but whether or not the enormous lobster will also be making an appearance on the royal supper table remains to be seen			0
delicious : the @entity56 tucks into a scone during a visit to the @entity112 something for supper ? the @entity56 inspects some of the fresh produce for sale in a @entity28 grocer adorable : an excited youngster snaps a picture of @entity70 petting his corgis during her visit to @entity28			0
