by @entity0 and @entity1 the family of a five - year - old who died of a rare blood disorder just weeks after suffering flu - like symptoms are today urging other parents to learn more about the condition			1
@entity8 first fell ill on her fifth birthday			1
within weeks she died , after doctors diagnosed the extremely rare @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , which leads to too many white blood cells attacking the body			1
doctors prescribed her antibiotics fearing she had tonsillitis , but were left baffled when her condition continued to deteriorate			1
by the time medics discovered @entity20 was suffering from the rare condition , it was too late			1
@entity8 first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday			1
just weeks later , she had died from a rare blood disorder called @entity11 ( @entity11 ) @entity26 and her husband @entity27 have urged other parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the rare blood condition that claimed their daughter 's life today her parents @entity36 , 47 , and @entity27 , 37 , have urged other parents to learn more about the disorder which claimed their young daughter 's life			1
mrs @entity26 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , described the all - consuming grief after losing @entity20			1
she said the family have established a charity in her daughter 's name to help others facing similar bereavement			1
violets in @entity50 , which mrs @entity26 says has given her ' something to live for ' , aims to help other parents who have lost children , raise awareness of blood disorders and encourage more standard testing			1
' when a child dies there are no positives to come from it , ' said mrs @entity26			1
' there is no reasoning ‘ why ? ’ - it should n’t happen			1
' it is against the natural order of things			1
' it is not like any other grief			1
it is like being lost at sea and the waves keep smashing you against rocks			1
' she added : ' she ’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality			1
@entity20 's parents @entity36 and @entity27 said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold			1
she was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate mr and mrs @entity26 described their daughter as a ' fighter ' with a ' strong and determined personality ' ' she was a real tomboy , too , and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite @entity88 pyjamas			1
' she refused to wear dresses from the age of three and she loved unusual music - we played @entity93 ’s @entity92 at her funeral as it was one of her favourite songs			2
' @entity20 's parents , who both work as benefits officers , first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five			2
the rare disorder baffled doctors , who diagnosed tonsillitis and suspected leukaemia			1
her father recalled : ' it was a monday and @entity20 went to school as normal but when she came home , she said she did n’t feel too well			2
' we went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale			2
we thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school			1
' but over the next couple of days you could tell she was n’t herself			2
she was still pale , tired and had a temperature			2
we put it down to a cold			2
' we had a party planned for her on the saturday			2
it was the first time we ’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall , with a @entity122 and bouncy castle			2
' we were debating whether to cancel it , but by the friday , she had picked up so decided to go ahead			2
' for the first half of it she was really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle			2
but then she got all shivery and we gave her some @entity127			2
she did pick up a little bit later on			2
' after repeated gp visits , @entity20 's desperate parents took her to @entity131 , where doctors suspected she had leukaemia			2
she was transferred to @entity134 mrs @entity26 said her family are determined to do something positive to celebrate @entity20 's memory , revealed they have started a charity , @entity20 in @entity50 , to help other families facing similar bereavement that day , @entity20 's father took her to see the nurse at their gp practice as she was too unwell for school			1
he was told she had tonsillitis and @entity20 was given antibiotics			1
but instead of improving , she got worse and later that week she saw the doctor			2
again , her parents were told it would probably clear up			2
the family went back and forth to see their gp over the next three weeks , but still there was no diagnosis			1
in desperation , the couple took her to @entity131			2
more tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia			2
she was transferred to @entity134 where a bone marrow biopsy was done			0
' @entity20 was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being done , ' said mrs @entity26			0
' she was very upset and it was heartbreaking to see her like that			0
' she would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of @entity11 , but of course we did n’t know at that point it was the disorder			1
' eventually doctors ruled out leukaemia , and finally , tests found that she had the @entity177 , which had led to @entity178			1
mr @entity179 , who has a daughter @entity180 , 19 , from another relationship , said that @entity20 was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated			1
@entity20 as a baby with mother @entity36 ( left ) and right , shortly before she died			0
her mother said : ' she was a real tomboy - and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite @entity88 pyjamas ' @entity11 was finally diagnosed but , although @entity20 started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy , it was short - lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems			1
doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma			0
' it was like a whirlwind , ' added mrs @entity26 , who has twins @entity201 and @entity202 , aged 16 , and @entity203 , 26 , from her first marriage			0
on july 20 last year the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital ’s nearby facility for relatives			0
but they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them @entity20 had deteriorated			0
mrs @entity26 added : ' we rushed to the hospital and saw @entity20 hooked up to so many machines			0
doctors told us that she was very poorly and did n’t think she would get through it			0
' later that day , we were told she would n’t pull through and that they could take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to say goodbye			0
' at this point she was n’t suffering , but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through this			1
' we decided to spend time with her , and we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away			0
' @entity20 , here with father @entity27 , was finally diagnosed with @entity11 , and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy			1
but she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma since @entity20 ’s death the couple , along with their other children , have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition			1
her father explained : ' we want people out there to know about @entity11 and what it can do and how quickly it can strike			1
@entity242 do n’t seem to be aware , and if it is something they are taught about then it can only help other sufferers			0
' i ’ve read up on the condition and if it ’s treated within four weeks of being detected , then you can save the person ’s life			1
when we first took @entity20 to the doctors , she probably had it then			0
but because they did n’t know about the disorder it went undetected			0
' in april they came up with the idea to create a memorial garden , under the banner of their violets in @entity50 charity			1
the initial project will cost up to £ 15,000 and will allow families who have lost their children to use the garden to remember them with their own space or plaque			0
' this is trying to find something positive from what has happened , ' mrs @entity26 said			0
' we want a lasting memorial to her legacy - something that will be there forever			0
' in the beginning it was soul - destroying trying to find the perfect place for her			0
@entity20 's mother said : ' before she died , we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away			0
' the family are now trying to raise more awareness about @entity11 ( @entity11 ) ' and then we thought if we are going through this then there are other bereaved parents in @entity287 and around @entity288 going through the same			1
' we did n’t want it in a church yard , as we did n’t want it to feel like a grave			0
and we did n’t want religion coming into it - we just wanted it to be about kids and parents			0
' having faced losing their treasured daughter , mrs @entity26 says she hopes her experience will help others			0
she said : ' in the first few weeks after @entity20 passed away we were literally on our own			0
' i am sure it is the same for other parents			0
in the hospital you are surrounded by a network - people looking after your children , psychiatrists , @entity309 , all kinds of support			0
' then you get home and you ’re all alone			0
that feeling is so frightening			0
the counselling starts a few weeks later , but suddenly you have to cope			0
' even things like finding money for a funeral			0
a lot of ours was paid for and we had some savings for the rest , but what if you do n’t have savings ? ' those are the kind of people we want to be able to help , and we have lots of ideas about how we can			0
' mrs @entity26 added : ' there is n’t a minute that goes by where we do n’t think about her			0
her legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again			0
we want to do this to keep her memory alive			0
it was too late for us but hopefully it wo n’t be for other families			0
