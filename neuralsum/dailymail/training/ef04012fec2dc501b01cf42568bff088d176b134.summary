@entity1 's panel of experts @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 discuss the lessons to be learnt from this summer what more must @entity8 do to challenge @entity10 as a captain ? @entity3 : still quite a lot			1
@entity8 has to learn both from the @entity14 failed to win and the three they did			1
he has to keep focusing on his batting – he has made technical changes that have worked against @entity17 but will they work against @entity19 ? @entity6 : not a lot			0
@entity10 had a fantastic attack in the last @entity22 and when you ’ve got that everything else becomes pretty easy			1
if @entity26 and @entity27 continue to bowl as well as they have done the captain can deal with any situation			1
a lot of this ‘ funky ’ captaincy business is for effect			0
@entity14 ’s worst moments this summer came when @entity8 let things drift			1
he must do things his way			0
@entity8 ’s strengths are leading by example and creating a healthy environment that earns the respect of his team			1
they are all behind him			0
once he scored runs at @entity56 everything else fell into place and he grew as a captain			2
how did @entity14 turn it around against @entity17 ? @entity4 : the senior players in @entity8 , @entity61 , @entity26 and @entity27 were all back to their best from @entity56 onwards which allowed the less experienced ones to grow without the pressure of delivering in every match			1
@entity17 helped by becoming obsessed with getting @entity26 banned and losing focus			2
@entity5 : a bit of luck , some resolve , and the realisation that something had to change			0
they were in denial until they got to @entity56			0
they were also helped by @entity17 ’s ineptitude			0
inspired : @entity14 's @entity77 has gone from strength to strength since taking the @entity81 slot @entity6 : cook being back in the runs was the key			1
once he scored them in the third test he became a better captain and @entity14 immediately looked like a much better team			1
he has n’t totally cracked it yet and he still has n’t got that hundred but he ’s getting there			0
@entity3 : through the senior players , mainly the fabulous bowling of @entity26 and @entity27 and the mental strength and steely determination of @entity8			1
they found rock bottom and discovered that the only way is up			0
@entity8 must take a lot of the credit for the way the series was transformed			2
who have been the star performers among the test new boys ? @entity5 : @entity77 has allowed us to quietly forget @entity105 and , unlike @entity105 , he has a fifth gear			1
it was a huge moment when @entity14 accepted that @entity110 ’s time was up			2
@entity6 : @entity77 first and foremost and @entity111 has gone from strength to strength with the ball but they have all done well			1
the only remaining question is what must they do with @entity119 ? i ’ve said it before but @entity119 must lighten up			0
he ca n’t be staring at the pitch after every ball			0
key man : @entity34 played a pivotal role in @entity14 's series triumph @entity127 and @entity26 thrilled with win @entity4 : @entity130 decision to give @entity77 the no 3 slot proved inspired and i am delighted that @entity111 has shown that he really can replace @entity133 as @entity14 ’s spinner			1
they have all been successes with the possible exception of @entity119 and all have the potential to grow more			0
@entity3 : it has to be @entity77			2
to come in and fill the massive hole left by @entity105 while being able to ease the pressure on @entity8 by increasing the tempo of his batting has been phenomenal			2
he can play in different ways and notably goes up through the gears			0
how do we become less reliant on @entity26 and @entity27 ? @entity6 : get @entity149 fit and firing			1
if he can get back to bowling anything like he was at his best then that will ease the pressure on @entity26 and @entity27			1
what @entity14 are doing is getting a good battery of fast bowlers together in time for 17 tests in nine months from next april			1
@entity149 and @entity159 should be equally as effective as @entity160 and @entity161			0
@entity3 : provide emerging bowlers with proper chances , like batsmen get			0
@entity165 has improved the more he has bowled			0
the key is to look after @entity26 and @entity27 so that they can go on as long as possible			1
i do n’t think either of them should play any more limited - overs cricket after the @entity171			0
pair of aces : @entity26 and @entity27 are a formidable new - ball partnership @entity5 : @entity14 already are			1
@entity175 was unlucky all series and @entity165 got better after a shaky start			0
waiting in the seam bowling wings are @entity149 , @entity159 and @entity179			0
@entity4 : it ’s all about this ‘ over-supply ’ of players that @entity184 talks about			2
@entity14 have to create as big a pool as possible to cope with the ridiculous demands that the schedule for 2015 and 2016 represents			2
@entity26 and @entity27 will have to miss one - day cricket to be available for all the @entity189			1
is @entity111 the answer as a spinner ? @entity4 : one hundred per cent yes			1
@entity192 put it perfectly when he said ‘ @entity111 may not be a @entity133 but he ’s no ugly duckling either			2
’ i always thought he was better than @entity8 and @entity130 seemed to think and he has proved it			2
he has the potential to be better than @entity198 next summer			0
@entity5 : he ’s not in @entity133 ’s class but these comparisons are unhelpful			0
what mattered is that he improved quickly			0
it ’s hard to say if he ’s frontline yet – @entity17 were too poor for us to tell – but he ’s way better than part time			0
positive spin : @entity111 is emerging as a frontline slow bowling option for @entity14 @entity3 : in the short term , yes			1
he has been the answer to balancing the side and there is no point in replacing him with a ‘ specialist ’ who can bowl just a little bit better , if there is anyone like that out there			2
@entity14 still need to find a left - arm spinner to compliment @entity111 while the structure needs to be looked at so we produce more spinners			1
@entity6 : yes i think he is			0
you do n’t take 19 wickets against @entity17 by accident ! he must have something			0
he has grown in confidence and got more shape in his action			0
@entity111 can be for this side what @entity233 was for the 2005 side			1
a key component of the team with ball and bat			2
what are our chances of regaining the @entity22 and what do we need to improve ? @entity3 : @entity14 ’s chances are good			1
home advantage is the key in modern test cricket			0
only @entity248 lost any tests at home throughout the whole of 2013			0
how we play @entity19 and @entity253 will be the key			0
@entity254 are an ageing side while @entity14 have potential to grow , both in and out of the side			1
@entity6 : @entity14 have every chance of regaining the @entity22			1
the likes of @entity19 , @entity253 , @entity260 and @entity261 are no spring chickens			0
will they all be here ? will @entity19 be as good again as he was last time ? one thing @entity14 can improve is the pitches			1
they wanted slow low ones last year against @entity254 but i think they will go the other way next year			0
follow the leader : @entity8 ’s strengths are leading by example and creating healthy environment @entity5 : it depends if @entity19 is fit and firing			1
if he ’s not @entity14 will win			2
they need a reliable opening partner for @entity8 and @entity61 must rediscover the form that helped beat @entity254 3 - 0 a year ago			1
@entity4 : i ’m confident @entity14 will win the ashes next year as long as @entity26 and @entity27 have not been finished off by all the cricket before then			1
we must keep our fingers crossed the operation on @entity27 ’s knee goes well while i think @entity14 need to find a new opener			1
name two players who could force their way into the side for the ashes @entity5 : @entity290 ’s opener @entity288 could be @entity14 ’s answer to slam bang @entity294 opener @entity292			1
and i hope @entity149 spends five @entity189 against @entity296 and @entity297 before then remembering what it ’s like to take @entity189 wickets			0
@entity6 : @entity288 could do it and here ’s a bit of a long shot for you , @entity306			2
i ’ve got everything crossed when i say that but a lot of people i respect have told me @entity306 can bowl			0
i have n’t seen it myself yet but i ’m taking their word for it			0
one to watch : @entity288 could force his way into @entity316 if he impresses in one - day format @entity3 : if @entity288 has a good six months of odi cricket then he could be a candidate but it would be a gamble			1
other than opening it ’s hard to see where @entity14 need new players for next year which is a good sign but i ’d say @entity149 if he concentrates on sheer pace			1
but both would have to improve to get into next year ’s side			2
@entity4 : i can see where everybody is coming from when they say @entity288 and it may just work but we might have to accept a few failures from him in exchange for the odd occasion when he would spectacularly come off			2
a second player ? keep an eye on @entity338 of @entity339			0
@entity14 rate him very highly .			2

@entity8 must keep leading the side his own way
@entity14 's senior players upped their game after @entity346 's
@entity8 became a better captain once he had runs under his belt
@entity77 and @entity107 have proven to be exciting additions
@entity14 becoming less reliant on @entity26 and @entity27
@entity111 is the answer to @entity14 's spinner *problem*
@entity14 have a good chance of regaining the @entity22 next year
@entity288 can force his way into the test team
