by @entity0 small victories : @entity2 has managed to overturn the @entity4 diktat that the flag must be flown for a week in may @entity2 is to snub his nose at @entity7 by announcing plans to celebrate @entity9 by flying the @entity11 flag as far away from public view as possible - in a cellar			1
the communities secretary has successfully overturned a @entity4 diktat that the 12 - star banner must be flown outside the buildings of all government ministries for one week from 9 may			1
the commission has rewritten its rules to state that the flag must still be displayed - but only somewhere on the premises ; not necessarily outside			1
mr @entity2 has cheekily responded by pledging to unfurl the blue and yellow standard in a spare room in the basement of his @entity26			1
and instead of being flown in the normal sense , the @entity11 flag will simply be pinned on a notice board - in a sign of what the communities minister really thinks of @entity7			1
the basement room was previously used as a subsidised bar for civil servants called the @entity36 , opened by his predecessor @entity37 in the late 1990s			1
mr @entity2 closed the bar as part of cost - cutting measures to bring down the deficit - and it now stands completely empty			1
there is no need for anyone to visit it			0
last night a source at the @entity26 said : ‘ we have a spare room in the basement of the building thanks to the closure of the “ @entity51 ” , so there is plenty of space for the flag down there			2
‘ the only @entity11 flag that should be flying is the @entity59 ’s union flag			0
’ the old @entity11 rules , agreed by @entity61 in 2006 , stated that government departments had to fly the @entity11 flag in front of its premises for one week every year , after @entity9 , on 9 may			1
visible failure to comply could have resulted in the @entity4 imposing fines			1
following pressure from mr @entity2 , the @entity67 has fought to renegotiate this requirement			0
and , on 21 december last year , new watered - down rules came forward			2
the new rules merely state that departments must ‘ display the @entity11 emblem at the premises of each managing authority ’			0
there is requirement to fly the flag outside , and the revised requirements could be met by an internal noticeboard somewhere inside the building			2
the victory was revealed in the @entity83 yesterday by mr @entity2 , who said the ‘ petty ’ @entity11 regulation agreed by the last @entity61 administration had now gone following talks led by his department			2
@entity2 rather cheekily said he would display the flag on a noticeboard in the basement of his department he told @entity91 this was an example of how the @entity59 could and should claim powers back from @entity7			1
he said : ‘ i would like to make a brief statement about the @entity11			0
the last @entity96 signed up to petty @entity11 laws that forced my and other departments to fly the @entity11 flag outside our buildings			2
‘ i can announce today that we have renegotiated this law			0
moving forward , this burdensome law to fly the @entity11 flag has gone			0
this small step shows our nation can and should claim powers back from unelected bureaucrats in @entity7			0
’ addressing speaker @entity110 , mr @entity2 added to laughter from mps : ‘ could i apologise to you for not flying the flag of @entity115 yesterday to celebrate your birthday			0
i hope you had a good day			0
’ mr @entity110 , mp for @entity115 , replied : ‘ you are forgiven			0

overturned @entity4 diktat that 12 - star banner must be flown outside government buildings for a week in may
he will instead pin it on a noticeboard in the basement of his department
