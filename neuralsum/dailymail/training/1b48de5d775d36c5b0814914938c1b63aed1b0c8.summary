@entity0 : his own story by @entity2 @entity4 kissed his feet and told him he ’d been his formative influence			1
@entity8 of the @entity9 was — is — devoted to him			1
and now , @entity0 has told his own remarkable story — possibly in the nick of time			1
rock ’ n ’ roll ’s original wild man , its most improbable survivor , is photographed in this absorbing biography with the latest of his seven wives , and looks as inert and dead - eyed as a waxwork			2
yet he made a @entity20 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live , pulling in an adoring crowd			0
the man they still call ‘ killer ’ continues to hammer those ivories like he always did , only now he hammers them with his walking - stick , a showman to the end			0
wild man of rock ’ n ’ roll : @entity0 in his heyday			1
he made a top 30 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live , pulling in an adoring crowd when the end does come , the surprise will be that it did n’t arrive sooner			0
@entity0 has outlived two of his wives ( the fourth and fifth of whom died in mysterious circumstances ) and even two of his children , but he has n’t exactly looked after himself			1
nor , for that matter , has he looked after his reputation			0
the man who so inspired @entity4 , @entity7 , @entity46 and many others has a seriously long rap sheet ; his many crimes include car theft , bigamy and assault			1
he acquired the nickname ‘ killer ’ while still at school , for half - strangling a teacher			0
his first cousin , tv evangelist @entity57 , no angel himself , has built quite a sideline out of praying for @entity0 ’s soul			1
it was a lost cause , that soul , long before the night in november 1976 when , dead drunk , @entity0 rammed the gates of @entity67 ’s @entity66 mansion with his @entity68			1
when the @entity71 police arrived to arrest him , they found that he had a loaded gun in the car			0
@entity0 rammed the gates of @entity67 ’s @entity66 mansion with his @entity68 to this day , @entity66 tour guides tell the story , and while @entity0 hotly denies to his biographer @entity2 that his intention that winter ’s night was to shoot his old buddy @entity67 , fact and fiction are as intertwined in this book as , well , rock and roll			1
so who knows ? @entity2 , a @entity83 - winning journalist , concedes at the outset that over the two summers he spent listening to @entity0 reminiscing , the old rascal remembered his life ‘ as it pleased him ’			1
so this is very far from a definitive chronicle			0
but it is still a thumpingly good yarn about a man whose amazing stagecraft once left even the similarly flamboyant @entity96 lost for words			1
in march 1958 , while touring with @entity96 and @entity98 , @entity0 grudgingly agreed to @entity96 topping the bill in march 1958 , while touring with @entity96 and @entity98 , @entity0 grudgingly agreed to @entity96 topping the bill			1
but he never made it easy for other performers to follow him onstage — @entity103 did it once , and refused ever to countenance the idea again — and one night in @entity106 , @entity0 made it impossible			1
with @entity96 waiting in the wings , @entity0 poured petrol over his piano , set it alight , and played @entity111 as it burned			1
some who were there attest that when eventually he swaggered off stage , with the audience exultant , flames still leaping from the piano and fire trucks on their way , he said to @entity96 , ‘ follow that , n * * * * * ! ’ to @entity2 , he vehemently denies using the n - word			2
again , who knows ? either way , it is hard to think of any musician of any era with a story as colourful as this , or with such a talent for finding trouble			0
but for all his crimes , all the drink , drugs , hot - headedness , the jaw - dropping extravagance , there was really only one scandal that @entity0 has never shrugged off			2
it erupted in @entity141 , in that same eventful year of 1958 , when reporters here learnt that he had recently married — bigamously , to boot — his 13 - year - old third cousin , @entity144			0
the matter was even raised in @entity146 , and he was booed at his concerts , and called ‘ cradle robber ’			0
this is where @entity2 ’s journalistic antennae go haywire , so in thrall is he to @entity0 ’s side of the story			1
@entity144 is presented as a seductive @entity155 , with 22 - year - old @entity0 powerless to resist			2
‘ she was slim , ’ writes @entity2 , ‘ with wavy brown hair and a swan ’s neck and big , big eyes , and if she was a child , he was a @entity161 monkey cosmonaut			0
’ the @entity162 , meanwhile , come across as moralistic prudes			0
in an otherwise thrillingly readable book , it ’s a rather revolting exercise in justification			0
still , it ’s true that back in rural @entity168 , where @entity0 came from , making a bride of your 13 - year - old cousin seemed like no big deal			1
@entity0 ' relationship with @entity67 was sullied and so his relationship with @entity175 , which began when she was only 14 , went uncensured he still ca n’t understand the brouhaha it caused , and remains deeply resentful that it so sullied his reputation when @entity67 ’s relationship with @entity175 , which began when she was only 14 , went uncensured			1
@entity2 tries hard , without ever quite succeeding , to get to the bottom of @entity0 ’s complex relationship with @entity67 , whom for several years he rivalled as rock ’ n ’ roll ’s hottest property			1
they were close enough to spend one wild night riding their @entity189 motorbikes round @entity71 , both stark naked , according to a story that @entity0 , this time , does not deny			2
just like @entity67 , @entity0 was born into @entity192 poverty in 1935 , the height of the @entity194 but each was thoroughly chippy about the other , and time has n’t diminished @entity0 ’s chippiness			1
@entity67 could n’t really act , he tells @entity2 , and @entity103 could n’t really sing			2
just like @entity67 , @entity0 was born into @entity192 poverty in 1935 , the height of the @entity194			1
also like @entity67 , he had a father who served time in prison			2
but @entity201 did one great thing in his life , mortgaging his small farm to buy the child prodigy a piano			0
before he became a star , @entity0 even trained to be a preacher , like cousin @entity57			2
his tortured @entity210 faith is another recurrent theme of his life			0
but pretty much everyone who heard him play the piano knew that ’s where his destiny lay			0
his big break arrived when he was 21 , when record producer @entity217 got him a gig on primetime tv , and he played @entity220 ’ on live on the @entity222			0
overnight his earning power leapt from $ 100 a show to $ 10,000 , and when he and @entity144 later had a son , they called him @entity227			0
but in 1962 , aged three , the boy drowned in a swimming pool at their half - constructed home			0
@entity0 was away on tour when it happened			2
@entity144 , still only 17 , was indoors , cooking spaghetti			0
popular music has a tendency to amplify the triumphs and tragedies of its greatest performers , but still it is hard to think of anyone who has ridden life ’s rollercoaster quite like @entity0			1
his rock ’ n ’ roll career never entirely recovered from the @entity144 scandal , but in the @entity248 , around the time his marriage to @entity144 was falling apart , country music embraced him and made him a superstar all over again			0
then , no sooner had he rescaled the mountain , than he went and lost another son , @entity253 , who died , aged 19 , in a jeep the old man had bought him			0
even if @entity0 had never played the villainous @entity257 alongside @entity258 and @entity259 in a 1968 stage production of @entity261 — which gives @entity2 yet another extraordinary episode to write about — this would still be a tale of @entity265 dimensions .			2
