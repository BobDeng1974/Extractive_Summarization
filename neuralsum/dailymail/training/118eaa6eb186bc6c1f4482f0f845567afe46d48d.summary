the @entity0 was taken to hospital yesterday , but in typical style the @entity2 continued with her @entity5 celebrations alone			1
hours before the start of last night ’s concert at @entity8 , prince @entity0 was taken by ambulance from @entity10 , where the royal couple had been resting following sunday ’s gruelling four - hour @entity13 pageant , after suffering abdominal pains			1
the @entity0 , who will celebrate his 91st birthday on sunday and underwent minor heart surgery at @entity18 , is now at the @entity19 in @entity20 where he has been diagnosed with a bladder infection			1
hospital : the prince , who is due to celebrate his 91st birthday on sunday , was today taken to @entity19 in @entity20 @entity8 said he would remain under the care of doctors for several days as a ‘ precautionary ’ measure			1
‘ he is , understandably , disappointed about missing this evening ’s @entity28 and tomorrow ’s engagements , ’ a spokesman said			1
have you taken any pictures of the @entity33 celebrations ? from the @entity13 to your town , we want to see them			0
send them for publication - with plenty of caption detail - to the @entity41 on the email address : @entity42 @entity2 , who was by her husband ’s side when he left the castle , is being kept informed of his condition but has no plans to visit him in hospital			2
and , with her husband ’s blessing , she immediately reassured her aides that the rest of the planned jubilee events , including today ’s service of thanksgiving at @entity57 followed by a carriage procession through @entity20 and a flypast over @entity8 , would go ahead as planned			2
last night members of the @entity61 poignantly left the @entity0 ’s seat in the @entity63 at @entity8 empty			1
prince @entity0 , pictured yesterday with the @entity2 , was today rushed to a @entity20 hospital after falling ill at @entity10 active : prince @entity0 , @entity0 takes part in the carriage driving at the @entity68 last month energetic : prince @entity0 lifts a car battery out of the way with little apparent difficulty at the @entity68 last month treatment : the @entity19 in @entity20 where the @entity0 is tonight receiving specialist care for a bladder infection			1
he was treated at the same hospital for a bladder infection in 2002 bladder infections are much more common in women than men , but millions of men are afflicted each year			1
they usually develop quickly and can be serious , even life - threatening , without prompt treatment			0
the most common triggers include dehydration , poor immune system or an underlying medical problem such as enlarged prostate – which affects the vast majority of men in their 80s and older – bladder or kidney problems			2
symptoms include the frequent need to go to the lavatory , fever , and sometimes blood in the urine			0
diagnosis of a urinary tract infection ( @entity101 ) – the medical term – is normally confirmed by a simple urine test			2
antibiotics are the first line of treatment and usually work within five to seven days for younger patients			2
however , if the infection is causing severe pain and the patient is elderly , hospital treatment may be prudent so that intravenous antibiotics can be administered			1
scans may be necessary and if the patient develops antibiotic resistance – an increasing issue in hospitals – the drugs can be changed to something more powerful			0
utis may cause someone to feel unwell or create a sense of confusion and disorientation , which can be alarming when the sufferer is elderly			0
this is usually resolved as the antibiotics start working , but every precaution will be taken when the patient is elderly			0
the actual cause is bacteria within the patient ’s body , which gets from its normal home in the bowel to the bladder which becomes infected			2
the infection may stay in the bladder or , more seriously , travel back to the kidneys			1
dr @entity139 , president of the @entity140 , said : ‘ prompt treatment should restore the @entity0 to health soon			1
’ the @entity2 was notably absent from the beginning of the concert , organised by @entity146 star @entity145 , but arrived half - way through , wearing a black cloak over a gold dress , in time for @entity150 to sing their hits @entity152 from the palace roof			2
while the @entity0 ’s condition is not believed to be serious , doctors will not be taking any chances , given his advancing years , because bladder infections in the elderly can get worse very quickly if not treated promptly			1
questions are likely to be asked whether it was wise to allow the @entity0 , who had a stent inserted in his heart less than six months ago , to take part in sunday ’s @entity166 , standing in the rain for four hours			1
it is understood that staff at ambulance control in @entity171 received a call from @entity10 shortly after 2pm reporting that prince @entity0 was feeling unwell			1
the medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance			0
despite his advancing years the @entity2 ’s husband has always enjoyed good health and most of his past ailments have been sports - related			0
before undergoing heart surgery at @entity18 his most recent previous illness was a cold in october last year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in @entity185			0
one of his most serious bouts of ill health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in @entity20 with a chronic chest infection			1
the @entity0 ’s absence from the rest of the @entity5 events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years			1
although she is , ostensibly , the ‘ senior partner ’ in their relationship , she relies on her husband ‘ utterly ’			0
‘ it may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne , ’ said a source			0
earlier this year the @entity0 , who is linked to more than 800 organisations , announced plans to scale back on all but his most important patronages , in the first nod he has given to his age			1
but he still carries out more than 350 engagements a year , making him one of the hardest - working members of the @entity61			2
three generations of @entity218 : the @entity0 ( centre ) with @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 yesterday on the @entity223 during the @entity166 celebrations : prince @entity0 ( rear ) arrives at @entity226 yesterday at the start of the @entity33 events committed royal : prince @entity0 , 90 , waves to the crowd during the @entity13 pageant yesterday on a long day of celebrations in an interview to mark his 90th birthday with the @entity236 , the outspoken @entity0 admitted he was reducing his workload			1
‘ i reckon i ’ve done my bit , i want to enjoy myself for a bit now , ’ he said			0
‘ with less responsibility , less rushing about , less preparation , less trying to think of something to say			0
‘ on top of that your memory ’s going , i ca n’t remember names			0
yes , i ’m just sort of winding down			0
’ for the majority of his 90 years , prince @entity0 has been notable for his robust constitution , and most of the ailments that have troubled him have been sports - related or accidental			1
in 1961 , the @entity0 broke a bone in his left ankle in a collision on the polo field			1
three years later , he was x-rayed after pulling a ligament in his left shoulder in a fall from his polo pony			0
@entity260 also left him suffering from arthritis in his right wrist , a condition made worse by shaking many thousands of hands at official functions			0
more recently , in 2004 , he was seen with dark glasses and a badly bruised left eye after slipping in the bath and catching the side of his eye with his thumb			0
in august 2008 , @entity8 took the unusual step of speaking out to deny a newspaper report that the @entity0 had been diagnosed with prostate cancer			1
the newspaper involved later apologised , saying it accepted the story was untrue			0
in january 2009 , 87 - year - old @entity0 missed a string of engagements with a bad back after pulling a muscle while carriage driving			1
and in 2009 he was forced to cancel several engagements after suffering a strained back – while carriage - driving – which left him in ‘ excruciating pain ’			0
yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade @entity0 to slow down , with one saying : ‘ no one would ever dare tell him to take it easy – you might as well take your life in your hands			1
’ in may 2006 , the @entity0 pulled out of a royal engagement after suffering from a trapped nerve in his neck			1
after a weekend recovering , he attended the @entity295 , appearing none the worse for wear			0
in 2008 , the @entity0 was admitted to the @entity19 in @entity20 with a chronic chest infection			1
at the time , senior royal sources told the @entity300 they had quite a job persuading him to seek further treatment after failing to fight off a heavy cold			0
the @entity0 vociferously protested that dr @entity304 , the @entity2 ’s personal physician , was over-reacting			2
but after battling the infection for several days , he finally accepted the doctor ’s advice			2
‘ typically , the @entity0 grumbled and complained , ’ said a source			2
‘ he did not want to go in			0
he really is n’t the best kind of patient			0
’ not a single member of his family paid him a visit during his three - night stay , although aides said that it was just the way he liked it			0
‘ the @entity0 can not bear anyone making a fuss			2
it would have been the last thing he wanted , ’ said one .			0

the prince , 90 , has a bladder infection and will be in hospital ' for a few days '
he is ' disappointed he missed last night **'s** concert and today **'s** engagements '
prince @entity0 also suffered from a bladder infection in *february* 2002
