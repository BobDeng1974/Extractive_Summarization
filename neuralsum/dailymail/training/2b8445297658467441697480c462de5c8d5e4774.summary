by @entity0 a @entity2 photograph has been disqualified after winning a prestigious photography prize after it emerged it broke the rules by being heavily photo - shopped			1
the image , taken by the newspaper 's staff photographer @entity6 , won the sports feature section of the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) ‘ @entity16 ’ contest for its depiction of a high school wrestling champion in @entity13 at the moment he won			1
however , the newspaper discovered the dramatic image had been edited from its original format prompting the picture editor to alert the authorities and have it withdrawn - after it had been handed a top prize			1
unedited : this is the version of the photograph entitled @entity25 which appeared in print			2
it shows the referee and the audience watching behind where 's the ref : in the version submitted for the prize the referee is much less noticeable			2
photo - shopping in such a way is against the rules of the prestigious prize the newspaper founded in 1877 said it has strict editorial guidelines on the use of photo - shop , and although the picture appeared in its unedited form in the paper , they said their rules extend to competition entries made by members of staff			1
photo - shopping in such a way was also barred in the competition entry rules			1
photography director @entity51 told the magazine news photographer : ' a @entity2 photographer entered an altered photograph to the @entity9 contest			1
' once @entity2 editors saw that it had been altered from what had originally been published in @entity61 , we withdrew the photo from consideration			2
the @entity2 's ethics policy prohibits the manipulation of photographs , and we have taken action in accordance with that policy			0
" @entity6 , who has worked at the paper for 16 years , is believed to have submitted ' state champion ' into the contest of his own accord			1
the two pictures , when presented side - by - side , clearly show the changes that have taken place			0
embarrassing admission : editors at the @entity2 informed the competition authorities that their staff photographer had made photo - shop changes to his winning entry that breached the rules the print version of the picture features a referee in the background of the dramatic shot while the competition entry has the figure of the referee blacked - out making him hard to notice and the wrestler more noticeable in the foreground			1
@entity9 president @entity95 's issued a statement on monday saying the photograph was ' digitally manipulated in violation of the contest rules '			0
' when we became aware of the altered image , the photo was immediately disqualified in accordance with our published contest rules , ' he said			2
' the rules state : the content of a photograph must not be altered in @entity108 or by any other means			0
no element should be digitally added to or subtracted from any photograph and the image must be a truthful representation of whatever happened in front of the camera during exposure			0
retouching to eliminate dust and scratches is acceptable			0
' disqualified : @entity2 photographer @entity6 , left , has been removed from the @entity9 prize after it emerged his picture had been photo - shopped ' reasonable adjustments in @entity108 are acceptable			1
these include cropping , dodging and burning , conversion into grayscale , and normal toning and color adjustments that restore the authentic nature of the photograph			0
' excessive changes in density , contrast , color and saturation levels that alter the original scene are not acceptable			0
backgrounds should not be digitally blurred or eliminated by burning down or by aggressive toning			0
frames or borders outside the image area are not allowed nor is text — digital or otherwise — allowed on the image			0
' the newspaper did not comment on @entity6 's ongoing status at the newspaper , telling the magazine they were ' taking action that is consistent with [ their ] photo manipulation policy , ' and that ' it ’s an internal personnel matter at this time			2

the image submitted by staff photographer @entity6 originally won the @entity156
however , the photography desk at the @entity2 later realized the competition entry had been heavily edited from the version that appeared in print - a practice *banned* in the contest
the newspaper alerted the prize - giving authorities about the alterations leading to the picture being disqualified
