by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 13 august 2012 u-turn : prime minister @entity2 said her government is now backing detention camps for asylum seekers , despite previously opposing the idea @entity7 plans to deport asylum seekers to detention camps in the poorer nations of @entity11 and @entity12			1
the proposal is a u-turn for the ruling @entity15 , which previously argued that @entity7 - funded detention camps were a waste of money that would fail to deter new arrivals			1
but in the face of ' too many lives being lost ' in rickety boats , prime minister @entity2 said her government has accepted recommendations to reopen camps established ten years ago by a conservative administration			1
laws to enable the deportation of asylum seekers will also be introduced to parliament			2
' when our nation looks at what is happening at sea as people attempt dangerous journeys to @entity7 , too many lives have been lost and i 'm not going to play politics or look at political scoreboards when too many lives have been lost , ' said ms @entity2 after the cabinet backed all the recommendations in the expert panel 's report			1
drawn up by a panel headed by former @entity48 chief @entity47 , the report combines proposals from all the major political parties , who have been bitterly divided on the issue			0
ms @entity2 commissioned the report six weeks ago after two people - smuggling boats capsized between @entity54 and @entity7 within a week			0
it is believed more than 90 asylum seekers drowned in the incidents			0
she said she hoped the report 's findings would break the political deadlock on the issue			0
but human rights group @entity62 said the recommendations are a major setback for @entity7 refugee policy			1
more than 7,000 asylum seekers - many from war - torn countries including @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 - have reached the @entity7 @entity73 territory of @entity74 in more than 100 boats so far this year			1
many @entity7 resent the growing numbers of asylum seekers arriving and the issue has emerged as a major threat to the survival of ms @entity2 's government , which is up for election again in late 2013			2
risky : a boat laden with refugees was driven onto rocks at @entity74 in december 2010 , killing many of those on board seeking a new life : more than 7,000 asylum seekers have reached @entity74 this year alone as the death toll from the dangerous voyages grows , the government has been keen to curb the traffic			1
in june , a boat carrying around 150 suspected asylum seekers capsized just off the coast of @entity74 , just a week after 90 people drowned on a similar journey			2
similarly , in december 2011 , as many as 200 died when an overcrowded boat sank off the coast of @entity101			0
in 2010 , 50 asylum seekers died when their boat was thrown onto rocks at @entity74 and in 2001 , a crowded boat known as the @entity106 sank on its way to @entity7 with the loss of 350 lives			1
despite the rising toll , the @entity110 rejected legislation that would have allowed asylum seekers to be deported to @entity113			0
the @entity15 has wanted to send asylum seekers to @entity113 as part of a swap deal , in which @entity7 would resettle bona fide refugees from @entity118 registered with the @entity119			2
but the conservatives argue that asylum seekers ' rights would not be respected by @entity113 because it has not signed the @entity124			0
reduced to tears : asylum seekers from @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity127 had to be rescued after their wooden boat began to sink off the coast of @entity54 in april too much to bear : the asylum seekers were hoping to get to @entity7 to start a new life the opposition maintains the detention camps should be in @entity12 and @entity11 , where both governments have expressed support			1
the report recommends the @entity12 and @entity11 centres be quickly re-established			2
it also said that the @entity113 deal needed more work to address human rights concerns , ' rather than being discarded or neglected			0
' opposition immigration spokesman @entity142 welcomed the report as an endorsement of his party 's policies			0
but he did not promise the opposition would provide the support needed by the government to pass the law through parliament .			0

expert panel recommends building new camps in poorer nations of @entity11 and @entity12
proposal is u-turn for government , which previously said camps were a waste of money
prime minister concerned ' too many lives are lost ' as asylum seekers travel on rickety boats to country
more than 7,000 people have so far reached the @entity7 @entity73 territory of @entity74 this year
@entity62 said proposal was a major setback for refugee policy
