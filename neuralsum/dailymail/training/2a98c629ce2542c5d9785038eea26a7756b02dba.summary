@entity0 then went 90 metres after intercepting @entity82 ’s pass and completed his hat - trick a minute before half - time after collecting @entity53 ’s perfectly - judged grubber kick			1
with @entity21 pouncing on another @entity8 handling error to add his second , the game was over as a contest by the break			0
replacement hooker @entity91 increased @entity34 ’ lead four minutes into the second half when he burrowed his way over from dummy half but @entity8 eventually stemmed the tide			2

@entity53 took a short pass from @entity64 to register his second try on 57 minutes to make it 42 - 6 but @entity8 , who finish 12th in the table , restored some pride with two tries in the last 15 minutes			2
winger @entity109 took @entity111 ’s long pass to cross at the corner , while @entity96 proved unstoppable on a rampaging solo run from 20 metres out and @entity62 kicked his third conversion			0
