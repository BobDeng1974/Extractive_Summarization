by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 23 september 2013 victim : @entity2 was a 21 - year - old college student when he was beaten and left to die in @entity3 , @entity4 in october 1998 new claims have been made about the murder of gay college student @entity2 in 1998 saying that his death was not actually a hate crime like it has so often described			1
journalist @entity9 claims that @entity2 was pistol whipped , beaten and tortured before being tied to a fence and left to die not because he was gay but because his attackers were high on meth and wanted to take his money			1
attackers @entity2 and @entity16 were both given life sentences and spoke out in 2004 saying that they had been on methamphetamine fore days before the october 6 , 1998 beating in @entity3 , @entity4 but gay rights activists have blasted the book for being an attempt at re-writing history			1
@entity9 maintains that over the course of more than 100 interviews with people with connections to the case he discovered that @entity2 was made into a gay rights martyr after the fact			0
he claims to have found a previously - sealed letter in the court filings on the case where a local male hustler wrote that @entity2 ' really did like having sex with gay guys , that he was n't unfamiliar with homosexuality and the gay world '			1
if that claim is true , it would dent the argument that the beating death was based around the attacker 's fear of homosexuality			0
in earlier interviews , @entity9 says that @entity2 and @entity16 believed that @entity2 was going to trade them drugs in return for sex and that they decided to rob him			0
attackers : @entity16 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) both received to two consecutive life sentences for @entity2 's murder and the case prompted the creation of national hate crime legislation new theory : now journalist @entity9 ( left ) , who is gay himself , has written a book claiming that @entity2 was killed because the two attackers were high on meth and wanted to rob him though he told @entity61 that he maintained ' rigorous journalistic standards ' during the investigation , this is not the first time that @entity9 has caused controversy on this topic			1
left - leaning site @entity67 said that @entity9 initially prompted outrage when he produced a news segment for 20/20 where he interviewed @entity2 who said that the attack was fuelled by his recent meth binge			2
' sometimes when you have that rage going through you , there ’s no stopping it , ' @entity2 said during that interview			0
' all i wanted to do was beat him up and rob him … seemed like a good idea at the time			0
' the press release accompanying the book painted @entity9 as an unbiased journalist , saying that ' his aim was to write a screenplay on what he , and the rest of the nation , believed to be an open - and - shut case of bigoted violence , ' going on to mention that ' as a gay man , he felt an added moral imperative to tell @entity2 ’s story '			2
controversial : the case garnered national attention because of the belief that the murder was caused by homophobia , but now this new book claims to debunk that theory national action : president @entity103 signed the @entity104 into law in 2009 which made hate crimes a federal issue one key connection that was left out is that @entity9 is a friend of attacker @entity16 's defense attorney , @entity110			1
the death of @entity2 - who was found in a coma after being left on the fence for 18 hours and subsequently pronounced dead six days later - was a major turning point for gay rights and hate crimes prosecution across the country			2
in 2009 president @entity103 signed the @entity2 and @entity118 into law , making it a federal crime to attack someone based on their actual or perceived gender or sexual orientation			2
the @entity126 has blasted all of the assertions in @entity9 ’s book , writing them off as ‘ innuendo , rumor or conspiracy theories ’			0
' attempts now to rewrite the story of this hate crime appear to be based on untrustworthy sources , factual errors , rumors and innuendo rather than the actual evidence gathered by law enforcement and presented in a court of law , ' the group said through a statement .			0

murder of gay college student @entity2 in 1998 caused national outrage and led to creation of federal hate crime laws
new book now claims that the two attackers were not motivated by his sexuality but were high on meth and wanted to rob him
both of the attackers are still in jail on *double* murder charges
