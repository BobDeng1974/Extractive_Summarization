when it comes to modern - day travel , the long waits at airports and cramped flights are considered a necessary evil			1
but some airports , it seems , are very much worse than others			2
while @entity11 @entity10 , in @entity12 , is often cited as the worst in the world , there are a surprising number of complaints form travellers about well - known hubs ranging from @entity18 in @entity19 to @entity20			1
so , which airports top the list when it comes to passengers complaining about their experience ? these are the hubs that appear to disappoint holidaymakers the most ... the layout at @entity29 has been criticised by many visitors @entity29 , @entity50 the @entity51 once described @entity18 as ' eight terminals connected by a traffic jam '			2
complaints generally revolve around the convoluted and unsigned layout , the lack of restaurants , activities and services for the layover traveller , and the general uncleanliness of the airport in @entity19 ( @entity63 )			1
writing on @entity65 + , passenger @entity64 described the airport , that handled almost 80 million visitors last year , as looking like it ' has n't been maintained since 1973			1
' he continued : ' @entity71 was horrible , no surprise there			2
@entity74 is spotty when it is n't non-existent			2
when returning internationally , customs was the slowest i 've ever encountered in my life			2
' @entity79 was similarly scathing in his one - star review when he wrote : ' this is the absolute worst airport i 've ever been to			1
it 's like the @entity83 of airports			1
' my flight was delayed			2
then you have to wait in line for almost two hours for them to give you a re-booking for the next day			2
' @entity18 is @entity90 's second busiest airport in terms of passengers handled each year , beaten only by @entity18			1
so perhaps it is no wonder passengers become frustrated with long queues for security , immigration and customs			2
there is good news though			2
in the latest @entity101 , @entity18 crept into the top 100 , making 98th place from a previous position of 102			2
@entity104 , @entity105 it is a favourite hotspot with @entity108 travellers , especially those looking for some winter sun. however , travellers complain that there is reportedly no air conditioning in the departure lounge and an expensive duty free shop			1
holidaymaker @entity114 told @entity115 : ' lack of places to buy food , surprise card charges when buying duty free make all in all a miserable and depressing looking airport			1
' @entity104 is an important check - in to explore @entity105 's holiday resorts , with queues like this experienced by many the opinion was similarly shared by @entity127 who left a @entity65 review saying : ' just flew in and out of this airport			1
the worst i have ever had the displeasure to use			2
' herded into the security area like cattle by extremely rude and abusive staff			2
there was one belt working although there were about 10 areas that could have been opened			2
@entity139 was n't too happy with @entity140 , and shared his views on @entity142 ' after finally getting through there and checking in yet more queues and abusive staff at passport control			1
my passport was literally thrown in my face after being stamped			0
' the airport has undergone massive renovations to accommodate dramatically rising leisure traffic , with officials stating they can now cater for around 13 million passengers annually			1
seemingly many of these passengers would n't agree			0
@entity155 , @entity156 , @entity50 @entity155 has been named as the most frustrating airport in @entity90			1
taking into account the time it takes to get there , the security processes , the quality of the terminals and facilities , and how many flights get delayed , @entity155 takes the crown that nobody wants			1
visitors to @entity155 @entity156 describe the airport as being underwhelming with less than helpful staff to be delayed at @entity155 is ' mind numbing ' according to research attained by @entity174 the research , conducted by @entity176 , used data from a user survey , airports ' on - time performance , and information on the ease of getting to and from the airports			1
it 's location , beyond @entity186 lines , means long taxi queues for arriving passengers and the airport scored an abysmal 91 out of 100 in @entity176 's survey			1
@entity191 says that the airport has ' drab décor , poor restaurant selection , lacklustre cleanliness , counter-intuitive layout and the notoriously unhelpful staff			1
' they add : ' while a departure from here is manageable , a delay here becomes the definition of mind numbing			1
' the airport was once likened to a ' third world country ' by @entity50 vice-president @entity207			1
people take to social networks on a regular basis to complain about @entity155 @entity11 @entity10 , @entity12 the 2014 guide to sleeping at @entity212 named the @entity12 airport as the very worst after tourists were asked to rate their airport experiences based on comfort , facilities , cleanliness and customer service			1
one customer likened @entity12 's @entity11 @entity10 to ' a central prison ' adding : ' many of the touts and taxi drivers loot people at the airport and outside '			1
tourists also criticised the absence of crowd control , ' pervasive corruption ' , inconsistent security checks and the overall lack of cleanliness and technology			0
some visitors to @entity11 @entity10 have described it as more like ' a prison ' the customer service aspect of the airport in @entity11 has been highlighted as a growing concern @entity20 , @entity240 , @entity241 the biggest gripe for tourists when travelling here is that they are not actually in @entity20 but @entity245			1
however , while that should be looked into pre-flight , a host of elements at the airport leave customers angry			1
a favourite with the budget airlines , crowds can become problematic both arriving at the airport and in the terminal			1
@entity240 is a favourite with budget airlines , and this can lead to long queues for customers some of customers ' biggest complaints are that everything from @entity74 to the bags used to put your liquids in are chargeable			1
writing on the review section of @entity101 , @entity269 described @entity20 as an ' absolutely ghastly place			1
' he added : ' as others have noticed they charge you for anything they can think of			0
' the ' short term ' car park is so far away heaven help you if it is raining			0
' security is a farce at the best of times , at times of minor demand it is appalling			0
' @entity286 did n't go into detail about his @entity288 , but was confident in his opinion and in her zero - star rating on the site , @entity290 wrote : ' @entity20 security is a shambles			1
be warned long queues causing passengers to miss their flights			0
' the whole @entity240 experience is extremely poor			0
' which ? travel has also waded in to the fray , branding @entity240 the @entity241 's worst airport for the second year running in 2014 in its annual survey of ' holiday hassles '			1
of the 8,000 people surveyed , it received a satisfaction rating of just 37 per cent , six per cent lower than the previous year			0
and one which ? member went as far as describing the airport as a ' hell hole '			1
@entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 @entity313 @entity312 is the world 's seventh - busiest airport , and one where it 's best to give yourself plenty of time to navigate the terminal			1
passengers claim sandwiches and snacks are overpriced , complaining that a simple baguette can cost as much as € 6 , while terminal corrections can mean over an hour spent navigating by shuttle			0
be prepared for a terminal transfer once checked - in at @entity312 in @entity313 @entity329 writes in their @entity65 review : ' in general it feels much better when you know you finally leave the airport - check in rush , security rush and everything else that 's in rush at the @entity312 ( basically everything ) makes you stressed out			1
' @entity341 was similarly depressed with his experience at the airport in the @entity314 capital by writing : ' the toilets are small and cramped , cubicles have no hooks			2
the only clothing shops here sell jeans that cost over 150 euros			0

@entity383 , @entity368 ( @entity384 ) research conducted by sleepinginairports.net from 2014 data reviewer @entity388 , writing for airlinequality.com , did spot some improvements though			0
last month he wrote : ' improved signage , still difficult			0
i have regarded @entity312 as one of the most confusing airports to change planes			0
since my last experience there has been significant improvement in signage			0
it is still not an easy or fast airport for changing flights but added signage makes it a bit better			2
' although not everybody is a fan			0
@entity405 , from the @entity50 , described @entity312 as an ' abysmal excuse for an airport '			2
he wrote : ' be prepared to miss your flight , because that is the likely outcome of the complete and utter inefficiency and disorganization			0
be prepared to have no one care whatsoever about your plight			0
' the airport also squeezed into the top 50 in the latest @entity101 - not bad for a hub that used to be ranked as one of the worst in the world .			1

@entity19 is one of world 's busiest , yet receives *negative* comments
@entity140 in the heat of @entity105 , yet no air - conditioning on departure
@entity155 in @entity156 described as the ' most frustrating ' airport
customers complain everything at @entity20 is chargeable
