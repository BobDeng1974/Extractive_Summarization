by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 30 september 2013 pregnant women should eat more fish after all , research suggests			1
they are usually advised to restrict consumption amid fears over mercury , which builds up in oily fish			2
the metal can damage the brain of unborn children			0
this has led to mothers - to - be being advised by the @entity13 to limit the amount of tuna , mackerel , sardines , salmon and trout they eat , and to avoid shark , swordfish and marlin altogether			1
warning : the @entity13 had previously advised mothers - to - be not to eat fish like mackerel , pictured , because of the metal but a large - scale @entity28 study suggests that concerns over mercury levels in fish may be unfounded			1
with fish credited as having numerous health benefits , the researchers said they hope that ‘ many more women will now consider eating fish during pregnancy ’ – although the @entity13 said that its advice remains unchanged			1
the researchers compared mercury levels in blood samples from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the @entity44 area with information about their diet and lifestyle			1
fish accounted for only 7 per cent of the mercury in the women ’s bodies , and food and drink accounted for 17 per cent			1
other sources of the toxic metal include air pollution , dental fillings and pesticides			1
overall , only 38 of the women – fewer than 1 per cent – had mercury levels higher than the maximum recommended by the @entity62			2
there is no official safe level in the @entity28			0
the study concluded that advice to pregnant women to limit seafood intake is unlikely to reduce their mercury levels substantially			1
no basis : a large - scale @entity28 study suggests that concerns over mercury levels in fish like salmon , pictured , are unfounded professor @entity77 , lead author of the report published in @entity79 , said : ‘ we were pleasantly surprised to find that fish contributes such a small amount to blood mercury levels			1
‘ we have previously found that eating fish during pregnancy has many health benefits for both mother and child			0
we hope many more women will now consider eating more fish during pregnancy			2
’ professor @entity92 , of the @entity93 , said : ‘ fish is a valuable nutrient and is something we would n’t tell patients to avoid because it is full of mercury			2
‘ we ’d say to eat more of it because it is full of omega - 3 oils and all things that are good for you			0
’ but the @entity105 said its advice stands			0
a spokesman said : ‘ most people do not eat enough fish			0
however , children , pregnant women and women who are trying to get pregnant should not eat shark , marlin or swordfish			1
if you are trying for a baby or are pregnant , you should have no more than four cans of tuna a week			0
mackerel , sardines , salmon and trout should not be eaten more than twice a week			0
’ the study also found that herbal teas were linked to higher mercury levels in the blood , perhaps due to contamination			2
wine appeared to raise mercury levels more than beer			0
however , women who ate lots of chips and white bread tended to have lower levels .			0

@entity13 warn pregnant women metal could be *harmful*
but results of large - scale study have *questioned* this theory
fish accounted for only 7 **%** of mercury in a women *'s* body
other food and drink accounted for 17 **%**
dental fillings and air pollution are also sources of the toxic metal
