no sooner had they paid £ 31.9million to sign @entity1 than @entity2 were announcing @entity4 ’s new five - year contract on tuesday			1
@entity4 will not be the only player to agree new terms at the @entity7 in the weeks ahead — with @entity8 and @entity9 expected to be next			1
@entity1 is @entity2 ’s sixth signing of the summer and by far their most expensive			1
and if anyone missed it , @entity11 has joined the @entity15 champions as well			1
@entity33 ’s arrival across town at @entity35 has understandably commanded huge interest , while @entity37 and @entity38 have emerged as the biggest spenders in the transfer market			0
@entity41 , still dizzy on their @entity43 triumph in may , made what was seen as a statement of intent by comfortably beating the champions 3 - 0 in the @entity48 last weekend			2
but if all that is meant to set alarm bells ringing at @entity2 , they are n’t paying too much attention			2
‘ we ’re not really here , ’ has become a popular ditty in the blue half of @entity55 in recent years and never has it been more appropriate than now			0
@entity18 was brought in to do his talking on the pitch , and any reporter who has tried to get a headline out of the @entity61 over the course of the last year knows just how well he has succeeded			2
the antithesis of his predecessor @entity64 , @entity18 is only interested in silverware not soundbites and he expects the same from his players			2
@entity75 ’s bizarre ‘ cake-gate ’ saga aside , the days of star players like @entity69 and @entity70 kicking up a fuss , or routinely being pictured kicking one another around the training pitch , are in the past			0
nothing sums up @entity18 ’s @entity2 better than their pre-season movements this summer			1
they started with a week in @entity80 and , you suspect , the manager would happily have stayed there rather than travel to @entity84			0
but while @entity35 were providing the headline act in @entity86 and playing @entity87 in front of a 109,000 sellout crowd in @entity90 , @entity2 were flying under the radar in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
staying power : @entity96 playmaker @entity4 has signed a new five - year contract at the @entity7 @entity98 signs new five - year @entity2 deal @entity84 boy : @entity11 has joined @entity2 on a short - term loan ahead of his move to the @entity103 even when they appeared at @entity105 , it was opponents @entity38 who drew significantly more support from the @entity110 public			1
that will not worry @entity18			0
nor will he be unduly concerned by sunday ’s defeat to @entity41 at @entity113			0
@entity2 were missing no fewer than seven @entity115 players and that does not include @entity1 , now officially the most expensive defender in the history of @entity120 football			1
it is worth noting that @entity18 ’s side lost 3 - 1 to @entity41 in @entity123 on the same weekend last year and still went on to win a @entity15 and @entity124 double			1
city have built on that success , paying @entity128 £ 44m to sign @entity1 and his teammate @entity129			2
@entity131 has been brought in to provide stiffer competition for @entity134 goalkeeper @entity133			0
@entity135 arrived as a free agent from @entity41 and @entity11 from @entity37 , albeit via @entity110			0
early days @entity2 got off to a losing start after defeat to @entity41 in the @entity48 it was n’t just the offer of a new £ 170,000 - a - week deal that convinced @entity4 to commit himself to @entity2 until 2019 yesterday , becoming the latest player after @entity143 and @entity144 to sign a new contract			1
‘ over the last four years we have achieved so much together , establishing @entity2 as a dominating force in @entity134 and now , when i look around this dressing - room , i can see no reason why we wo n’t become one of the top teams in the world , ’ said @entity96 ’s @entity4			1
‘ it was a straightforward decision to extend my stay here and spend my peak years at @entity2			0
why would n’t i want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team ? ’ with @entity2 ’s relatively conservative spending in the transfer market this summer forced upon them by @entity161 , there will be outgoings			0
exit strategy : @entity164 could be one of many players leaving @entity2 after his departure to @entity167 @entity164 has been sold to @entity167 and @entity168 is on the verge of joining @entity170 for £ 12m			1
@entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 could all follow			1
even then , @entity18 would have one foreigner too many for his @entity176 quota meaning that @entity177 — sidelined until the end of next month with a fractured metatarsal — could be left out of the squad for @entity161			2
either way , business will be conducted like everything else , quietly and efficiently			0
