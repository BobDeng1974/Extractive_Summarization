by @entity0 last updated at 10:00 pm on 13th february 2012 the night before his february 4 breakout game against the @entity5 , @entity3 phenomenon @entity1 found himself homeless			1
the sofa where he usually slept at his brother @entity9 's @entity8 @entity7 apartment was taken -- there was a party that night there			1
so @entity1 shacked up at the modest @entity15 , @entity7 , home of teammate @entity17			1
and crashed on his coach , a simple brown sofa			0
the couch is now one of the most famous pieces of furniture in @entity25 history			0
the next day , @entity1 , 23 , captured the hearts of @entity7 and the attention of basketball fans around the country with his explosive play -- a career - high 25 points , five rebounds and seven assists			2
he 's gone from sitting on the bench to the @entity3 ' starting lineup as the team has gone on a five - game winning streak			2
and it all began on this couch			0
famous couch : @entity1 crashed here , at @entity17 ' apartment , before his stunning performance against the @entity5 breakout performance : @entity1 has become an overnight sensation for his explosive play on the court since the game against the @entity5 last week ' ladies and gentlemen , the one and only couch made famous by @ @entity53 ! let the bidding begin , ' @entity17 tweeted sunday afternoon			1
@entity1 , a 6 - foot - 3 point guard who played for @entity55 , said the couch was ' decent , but not huge			0
' after his stunning performance against the @entity5 , @entity1 told reporters about his accommodations the prior night : ' thank you to @entity17 for hosting me			1
i think i might just move in with him , ' he said			0
@entity1 's precarious accommodations prompted real estate developer and attorney @entity64 to offer him free use of an apartment until he finds a more permanent place to settle			0
upscale : @entity68 recently sold his $ 12 million @entity70 mansion for a $ 6 million loss high rolling : @entity68 , left , pictured with his wife @entity72 , makes more than $ 18.5 million a year			2
@entity17 and @entity1 , right , live more humble lives , pulling in about $ 620,000 per year each @entity1 's digs are a bit humble , compared to the multimillion - dollar digs that have become the norm for some of his teammates and the players he has beaten this month			1
for example , fellow knick @entity68 has a three year contract worth $ 65 million			2
he 's reportedly renting a condo in the @entity86 neighborhood for $ 22,000 a month			1
he and his wife @entity87 bought a $ 2 million 6,500 - square - foot home in @entity89 with 4 bedrooms , 4 bathrooms , an infinity edge pool and a cabana in the backyard			0
but that 's a pittance compared to the $ 12 million he spent in 2007 for a sprawling 21,000 - square - foot mansion in @entity70 when he was playing for the @entity70			0
he reportedly sold it for a loss of nearly $ 6 million when he moved to @entity7			2
luxury : @entity100 pays $ 37,000 a month for his condo at 99 @entity102 star power : @entity100 is one of the highest - paid players on the @entity3 , with an annual salary of more than $ 18 million @entity81 's center @entity100 lives similarly large			1
he 's reportedly renting a $ 37,000 - a - month condo in @entity7 's @entity108 , which offers 4,500 square feet inside and a 4,500 - square - foot patio			1
he also recently paid $ 3.7 million for a six bedroom , six - and - a - half - bathroom mansion in a gated community in @entity113 , @entity114			0
@entity100 will rake in $ 99.7 million over the life of his five - year contract with the @entity3			1
none of that compares to @entity119 , however , who makes more than $ 25 million a year			0
that salary did n't keep @entity1 , whose comparatively paltry salary is less than $ 620,000 , and his @entity3 from beating the @entity122 92 - 85 friday night			1
of course , @entity119 might night a couch of his own to crash on soon			0
it was recently disclosed that his wife @entity125 will get all three of his @entity89 - area mansions , including a newly - built $ 11.2 million estate , when the couple finalize their divorce			0
big money : @entity119 is set to lose this $ 4.6 million @entity89 - area mansion , and two other homes , in his divorce $ 25 million : @entity119 is the highest paid player in the @entity25 , but that did n't stop @entity1 and the @entity3 from beating his @entity122 last week			2

@entity1 had been *sleeping* on his brother 's couch but moved to @entity17 ' sofa the night before the @entity5 game
teammates @entity68 and @entity100 pay $ 22,000 and $ 37,000 , respectively each month for @entity7 apartments
@entity1 now has a contract for $ 620,000 a year , compared with more than $ *18m* for the other @entity3 stars
