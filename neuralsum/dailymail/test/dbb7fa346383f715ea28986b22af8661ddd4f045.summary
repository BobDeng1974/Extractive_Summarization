she said : ' i 'd read an article about her , and had arranged it even before i 'd had the @entity62 – she had a long waiting list			0
i was in an emotional state of shock when i saw her in december 2008			0
' i was convinced she was going to tell me i was too old			0
yet she was incredibly reassuring , giving me confidence without raising my hopes to unrealistic levels			0
' she ran a series of checks including blood tests and scans			0
she only prescribes after she 's been through the results			1
' in january 2009 , alongside regular acupuncture sessions , i started taking specially prepared herbs , following her advice on which supplements to take and made several changes to my lifestyle ( including giving up alcohol , taking no vigorous exercise and avoiding cold drinks )			1
' one month later , i ’d just returned from holiday and realised my period was late			0
i bought a pregnancy test and discovered i was expecting ! i carried on with the acupuncture , herbs and supplements throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
' i gave birth to @entity51 in november 2009 when i was 41			0
i genuinely believe that if i had n’t seen dr @entity33 , i would n't have my son			1
' the new @entity16 documentary , which airs this evening follows may @entity93 , 36 , who hopes to have a success story like @entity52 's after five years of trying			0
she turned to dr @entity33 after losing a baby she conceived via @entity62 treatment on the @entity97			1
@entity52 had her son @entity51 in 2009 when she was 41 after having treatment at dr @entity33 's clinic she said : ' i got pregnant and i carried through for 11 weeks but then i miscarried a month ago			1
' i think about it every day but you have to move on so that 's why i 'm here			0
you have to take positive steps and not think about what is lost			0
' may has an initial consultation with dr @entity33 which costs £ 250 for an hour			2
during the assessment , dr @entity33 quizzes her on her lifestyle and observes that she does n't appear to be in the best health because of the appearance of her tongue and her pale complexion			2
but she tells her she had potential and she 's confident she will conceive			0
may pays £ 300 a month for tea made from @entity21 herbs			1
further check - ups with dr @entity33 will cost her £ 130 , while three sessions of acupuncture at the clinic cost £ 350			1
after a period taking the @entity21 herbal tea , she is then prescribed a mixture of @entity21 herbs in a pill form which must be taken 24 times a day ( 12 in the morning and 12 in the evening ) for two weeks , costing around £ 150			1
the @entity16 documentary catches up with may months on from her first appointment with dr @entity33 and while she still has n't become pregnant , she remains hopeful			2
she said : ' i 've got the clinic on my side , this can happen			0
it does n't bother me that i 'm not pregnant yet			0
at my last consultation , dr @entity33 said i 'm not ready yet , i need to fix what 's inside			2
' but may adds that if she still does n't fall pregnant , she will ditch the alternative therapies in favour of @entity62 on the @entity97 again			0
dr @entity33 said acupuncture aids fertility because it ' promotes your body 's natural healing response and stimulates natural energy flow ' in her book , how to get pregnant , dr @entity33 said her methods work for those who ca n't be helped by @entity62			1
she writes : ' i believe that our success rate is high because most patients who have trouble conceiving are not suffering from mechanical problems such as blocked fallopian tubes ( these can be fixed by surgery or bypassed using @entity62 )			0
goji berries are one of the ingredients that may be found in dr @entity33 's fertility boosting vitamins ' the most common causes of @entity62 failure are poor sperm production , poor quality eggs , malfunction of the ovaries or the blood supply with the abdomen not being healthy enough			2
' couples who find it difficult to conceive have problems that can often be helped by kick - starting the reproductive system , improving sperm quality and quantity and improving the menstrual cycle			2
' she said the herbal medicine , combined with a change to a healthy diet and light exercise , can work because : ' herbal medicine has powerful healing properties which work on the internal organs and the reproductive system			2
' it aims to clear obstruction , rectifies the balance between yin and yang in the organs and helps to restore normal bodily functions			0
' she also claimed : ' most importantly , herbs have proved capable of reducing chromosomal abnormality in male sperm and female eggs so improving quality of both			2
' when it comes to another of her recommended treatments - acupuncture - she writes on her website : ' acupuncture is believed to work by promoting your body 's natural healing response and stimulating and balancing natural energy flow ( known as @entity209 or chi )			2
the @entity16 documentary @entity212 also looks at other alternative therapies on offer for various ailments			0
' @entity217 ' @entity216 , pictured , says the worms can work wonders for the health ' practitioners are trained to understand that the network of the energy pathway ( known as meridians ) that connect the organs of the body			0
' when one of these pathways becomes blocked or malfunctions , problems such as pain , illness or disease may result			0
' by stimulating the specific acupuncture points , @entity237 [ traditional @entity21 medicine ] practitioners are trained to clear blockages in the body 's meridian system , with the aim of restoring balance in the body			1
' acupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into the skin and is an ancient @entity21 treatment that is being embraced more widely in the west for problems such as stress and back pain			1
it has not yet been proven to help women conceive but it is thought to increase the chances - possibly because it makes a woman more relaxed			0
as well as looking at alternative therapies for infertility on @entity10 , tonight 's documentary also looks at the other unusual treatments - such as applying leeches to the skin to relieve pain - that people are turning to when traditional western medicine has n't helped them			1
