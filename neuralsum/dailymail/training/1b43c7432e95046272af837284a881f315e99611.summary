unmasked : blogger @entity0 has used @entity3 for a series of vile comments this is the face of one of @entity9 ’s most notorious internet trolls			1
as his alter ego @entity11 , @entity0 is responsible for a series of vile and offensive @entity3 posts that have brought him death threats			1

he posted a picture of two overweight women and claimed ‘ this is what crushed the 96 ’			2
@entity0 , 51 , a recruitment consultant and father of six from @entity27 , @entity28 , also made disgusting comments about the murder of @entity31 which deeply upset his mother			1
but an unrepentant @entity33 claims people who are offended by his comments have only themselves to blame			0
‘ it is not my responsibility what other people find upsetting			0
i did n’t target anyone			0
i did n’t send an email			0

i do n’t care what people find offensive			0
’ justifying his tweet about @entity21 , he added : ‘ this is dark humour			0

’ this week , the self - proclaimed ‘ satirical terrorist ’ will seek to justify his vitriolic internet posts in an @entity53 documentary called @entity54			1
@entity0 agreed to be filmed without his pig mask , although his face was not shown			1
but @entity58 traced @entity0 to his dilapidated @entity60 home in @entity27			1
with an appearance more akin to @entity63 ’s hapless cafe owner @entity62 than a cutting - edge satirist , he initially denied he was @entity2			1
masking his identity : how he appears on twitter but later , speaking at the wheel of his battered @entity69 vehicle , gap - toothed @entity0 said : ‘ i am there to upset the apple cart			1
it is a form of entertainment			0
trolling is like putting a fishing line in a shoal of fish and seeing what you can get			0
