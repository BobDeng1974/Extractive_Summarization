by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 11:09 est , 23 july 2013 the @entity1 and @entity2 are moments away from becoming parents for the first time			2
but as they plan for the huge life change a newborn brings to any family , no matter how wealthy or how blue the blood , one things is for sure : @entity12 will be doing this very differently from previous generations of @entity15			1
the two are said to be planning to break with the long standing tradition of a formal nanny ( or many nannies ) taking control of childcare in the royal household			1
instead they advertised for a housekeeper to help with multiple household chores and help watch the royal baby , with @entity2 and @entity26 expecting to do much of the hands on care taking themselves			1
previously nannies were a huge part of the lives of royal children , with prince @entity50 , for instance , raised almost exclusively by a team of highly trained nannies			1
@entity50 had two main nannies , nurse @entity54 and @entity55 , who were surrogate mothers to him throughout his childhood			2
at the time - he was born in 1948 - a nanny was expected to do much of the hands on child rearing , with parents playing a far less hands - on role than we would expect today			1
children of the upper classes were expected to be presented to their parents by the nanny , neat and clean and on their best behaviour			2
and the @entity15 were no exception			0
indeed , the @entity70 , then princess @entity70 , was not present at @entity50 ' first three birthdays			0
and although that may sound harsh by today 's standards , it would have been the norm at the time , especially given the pressure of her royal duties			0
prince @entity50 was supported by his nanny , @entity55 , when his parents went on a six month tour when he was three years old			0
he later credited his nanny for providing critical emotional support in his early childhood years and beyond			0

despite growing up with a full - time nanny , @entity26 and his wife @entity2 are not to employ full - time help princess @entity92 leaves @entity93 's with @entity26 and @entity94 and nanny @entity85 : @entity26 's nanny helped him through the difficult time of his parents divorce when it came to his own children , @entity50 and , of course , @entity92 , were much more involved on a daily basis wherever possible , although they still employed two nannies , @entity85 and @entity103			1
@entity85 , from the prestigious @entity104 , stayed with the family for over 15 years			0
the formidable pair - of whom the children were incredibly fond - reportedly took the young @entity26 to parks in @entity87 in ' secret ' , in ' civilian ' clothing and with just a single security guard , to give him as many normal childhood experiences as possible			1
@entity85 cared for both @entity26 and prince @entity94 when they were young boys , including the difficult period when their parents ' marriage was breaking up in the early 1990s			0
@entity26 was devastated when @entity85 died in 2012 , and cancelled numerous engagements to be able to attend her funeral			0
as a child , the @entity70 ’s nanny , @entity116 ( affectionately known as @entity117 ) would have been staffed by a team of nursemaids , under - nurses and chambermaids , with the @entity123 nanny dedicating her time to being with the children and overseeing their strict daily routine			0
later @entity126 joined the royal household as @entity128 , a role that incorporated private tutoring , some of the duties of a nanny and as a companion			1
in a modern twist on the nanny role , @entity126 was in training to be a child psychologist when she accepted the post			0
at just nine months old , @entity70 ’s parents went on a six month tour of @entity142 and @entity143 leaving her behind with her nanny			0
during this period the nanny would have been required to send regular updates of @entity70 ’s progress detailing significant events			0
via post one such letter accompanied by a photograph of a smiling @entity70 dated 8 march 1927 stated : ' if @entity153 looks into my mouth with a little magnifying glass she will see my two teeth			0
@entity70 ; quite well and happy ! '' @entity159 , a @entity160 - educated nanny and adviser to nanny firm @entity158 told @entity162 in a recent interview how much the role of baby care - giver has changed from @entity70 to @entity50 , and how much it will go on to transition as @entity26 takes on a parenting role to his own son or daughter			1
she said : ‘ with news that the royal couple have recently reported a job advert showing they are looking for a housekeeper , perhaps they are moving with the times and going for a modern approach to childcare			1
princess @entity178 and prince @entity50 are whisked away from @entity179 by their nannies after @entity178 's christening in 1950 prince @entity50 - waving to bystanders - and his sister @entity178 are taken by their nanny into @entity186 with bouquets of flowers to call upon their great - grandmother , @entity189 , on her 84th birthday in 1951 ' with roles including walking the dog , polishing silverware , driving the car and watching the baby , the new all - encompassing housekeeper is a million miles away from the type of care that previous royalty have received			1
’ ms @entity159 explains that the role of the @entity123 nanny has dramatically changed in parallel with the evolution of the royal family themselves			1
the @entity15 have modernised their opinions about the needs of their children and how they view themselves , their influence as parents , and the interaction they wish for			0
ms @entity159 explains that ‘ broad shoulders and a tough skin were necessary attributes to cope with the amount of opinion shared about the quality of the job [ nannies ] were doing by many members of the royal family and the public ’			1
princess @entity178 's son , @entity222 , on his way to nursery school with his nanny , @entity55 in 1980 ( right ) ms @entity159 says : ‘ the role of the @entity123 nanny would have been a tricky one to get right in terms of relationships ; needing to acknowledge that the children may well see their nanny as a central and significant figure in their lives and someone who they could rely on to always be there ; yet also someone who would never outshine the central and influential role of the parent			0
speaking about the arrival of @entity26 ’s own son or daughter , ms @entity159 said : ‘ much has been speculated about the appointment of a @entity123 nanny and whether that role will be full or part - time , but what ’s important is that whoever is charged to look after the little one will know the child and the parents ’ preferences very well			1
‘ this blending of care is a skill that the nanny will need to be an expert at ; making sure that their practice is guided by the @entity1 and @entity2 ’ ideas and wishes primarily			0
‘ as with previous @entity123 nannies , the new royal baby ’s carer will be expected to have qualifications and experience and be knowledgeable about current issues and how these can be interpreted to benefit the child and family			1
’ devoted royal nanny @entity103 carries prince @entity26 onto a plane at the start of the six week royal tour of @entity142 in 1983 nannies have traditionally always helped royal mothers : @entity70 holds prince @entity50 hand while a nanny carries princess @entity178 as they catch a train to @entity274 to rejoin @entity275 the @entity276 and @entity277 in 1950 prince @entity50 with one of his nannies , nurse @entity54 @entity50 ' @entity280 ' by @entity281 @entity50 had two main nannies , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the queen was not present at his first three birthdays @entity26 with his beloved deputy nanny , @entity85 @entity286 and @entity287 ' the @entity160 nannies are easily recognisable from their distinctive brown uniform , which is strictly enforced the tradition of nannies in the royal household goes back centuries			1
nannies appointed by the royal household would have led a very restricted life , but helped shaped countless monarchs ' personality , outlook and manners			2
the royal family have tended to hire from the exclusive @entity301 , where students are taught all aspects of childcare , including the manners and decorum required by a @entity123			2
famed for their strict old - fashioned brown uniform , @entity160 nannies are considered to be some of the best in the world , and some of the most expensive			2
in terms of the hierarchy of staff within royal households during the @entity70 ’s childhood , nannies sat relatively near the top spot			2
however the position could be a lonely one , as the role fell between the rest of the household staff and they were considered neither ‘ upstairs ’ nor ‘ downstairs ’			0
an obsession with rigid routines - believed then to be essential for every child – means that most nannies were expected to put their lives on hold and dedicate themselves to a family that was not their own			2
although the majority of royal nannies remained single , they were always addressed as ‘ mrs ’ to acknowledge their position and to show respect			2
@entity160 nannies are put through a grueling course , training in all aspects of child care and adhering to the college 's traditional methods			1

previous royal generations employed traditional nannies from prestigious firm @entity347
royal babies were very much ' seen and not heard ' by parents
but @entity12 are said to prefer a more *informal* approach
the two advertised for a housekeeper to take on general role with childcare
pair plan to be as hands - on as possible with both taking on day - to - day care
