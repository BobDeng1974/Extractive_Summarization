by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:08 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 03:19 est , 23 october 2012 sir @entity2 has been asked to continue running the @entity3 rail line for another year , as minsters scramble to keep trains moving			1
in an embarrassing u-turn , the @entity7 had to plead with @entity9 to remain in control of the line for between nine and 13 months despite stripping it of the lucrative franchise in august			1
virgin was due to hand over the line to rival @entity16 on december 9 but ‘ significant technical flaws ’ in the contract competition were unearthed this month , which saw three civil servants suspended and the deal torn up			1
@entity9 boss @entity21 boss sir @entity2 has been asked to continue running services on the @entity3 main line for up to 13 months @entity9 will now run the services in the short term while the government decides who will operate the franchise on a more permanent basis			1
today sir @entity2 said on @entity32 : ' positive day for all the wonderful staff at @entity9			1
' the decision marks a major pr coup for sir @entity2 , who said on @entity32 : ' positive day for all the wonderful staff at @entity9			1
' this summer the tycoon saw his complaints that the contest had not been fair repeatedly rebuffed by the government			0
he branded the bidding process for the @entity41 to @entity43 line ‘ insane ’ and launched a legal challenge			1
he called on @entity45 to intervene , but the prime minister was assured that the decision was safe			0
as the @entity7 prepared for the court case , major flaws were discovered in the use of inflation and passenger numbers			0
the future of the @entity3 , which runs from @entity41 to @entity43 , will remain uncertain for several months the collapse of the deal is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 100million in compensation and re-running a new bidding process			1
the quick - fix of @entity14 running services until next year will be followed by an interim franchisee before the full - length contract is awarded			1
transport secretary @entity63 said today : ‘ the cancellation of the @entity66 franchise is deeply regrettable and i apologise to the bidders involved and taxpayers who have a right to expect better			1
‘ my priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on december 9 services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected			1
‘ i believe @entity14 remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and i will be working flat out to make this happen			2
’ transport secretary @entity63 today said the cancellation of the @entity3 franchise is ' deeply regrettable ' as the rail chaos grips the department , mr @entity86 also announced he was pausing the live competitions to run services on @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
two independent reviews will also examine what went to catastrophically wrong with the @entity3 competition and the way the @entity7 runs its rail franchise programme			2
@entity14 has run the @entity3 line since 1997 but in august @entity100 , the then @entity63 , announced she was handing a new 13 - year deal to @entity16			1
as @entity7 officials prepared for @entity14 ’s legal challenge to the decision , they uncovered major problems with the economic model used to decide who to award the contract to			2
today a @entity9 spokesman said : ' our customers have made clear they want us to continue our excellent service and we now have the chance to deliver that and offer customers some short - term continuity			2
' we will now be working hard to make sure we continue to provide the service that has made us successful			0
we are grateful for the fantastic support from customers and staff over recent months			0
' @entity121 , @entity122 's shadow transport secretary , said ministers could not claim to be unaware of the details of the deal			1
she told @entity126 : ' these are multi-billion pound contracts			0
this contract was supposed to run for up to 15 years			0
it ’s simply not good enough for ministers to claim that it was all a technical issue , and that they could n’t be expected to look at this , at the same time as they ’ve made franchising much more complex , they have then taken away part of the @entity7 ’s ability to deal with this , and removed the department ’s capacity to get it externally checked			0
' that to me seems to be squarely a problem with ministerial oversight , ministerial leadership , and it ’s not correct for them to try and blame three civil servants for what ’s gone wrong – especially not before their own investigation has even reported			0
' the @entity152 service was reintroduced by the government - owned directly operated railways the decision to ask @entity14 to continue running trains on the @entity3 line means ministers have rejected the idea of running the line themselves			1
@entity161 of the railways is something the unions have demanded for @entity165 2009 @entity166 walked away from the @entity168 franchise , and the @entity122 government took control of services			0
a new government - owned company , @entity172 , was created and has run the services ever since			2
it recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £ 7.1 million in 2011 - 12			0
in the four weeks to august 19 , 93 per cent of @entity168 trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011			0
the four - hour @entity152 express service from @entity179 to @entity41 ( pictured ) was reinstated and extra services to @entity181 and @entity182 were introduced			0
the apparent success of the state - running of services caused the @entity187 transport union to call for the same to happen on the @entity3 line			2
responding to the news that @entity14 will continue to operate the franchise for up to 13 months , @entity187 leader @entity189 said today : ' the government are ideologically opposed to public ownership of the railways and , in collusion with the private train operators , have stitched up a shabby deal that will enable them to rerun the whole franchise fiasco in a year ’s time			1
' @entity2 and his shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank			0
not only have they made hundreds of millions from the rail privatisation lottery but they have now scooped the rollover as well			0
' we will continue to fight for public ownership of the railways , a position supported by the vast majority of the @entity214 people			2
this short - term political fix will not detract from the call for rail to be run as a public service free from the chaos and greed of privatisation			2
' @entity172 overhauled the @entity168 timetable , introducing almost 20 new weekday services			0
it also invested in better first class carriages including at seat food and drink and on board @entity226 which lead to @entity229 passenger numbers rising by a third .			0

@entity14 boss hails a ' positive day ' for his staff as the transport secretary @entity63 says the public *deserve* better
