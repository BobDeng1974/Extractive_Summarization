it is the rolling countryside that inspired @entity2 's most celebrated works , including his masterpiece - the @entity3			1
but residents fear that ' constable country ' is under threat because of a proposed development which could bring 160 houses to the small @entity10 village where the landscape painter was born			1
developers have put forward plans for a mix of 50 affordable homes , 94 town houses and several apartments on the outskirts of @entity19			2
the homes would be built just over a mile from @entity21 , where @entity2 painted the @entity3 in 1821 as well as @entity22 and @entity23			1
developers hope to build near @entity21 , where @entity2 painted the @entity3 ( pictured ) in 1821 @entity2 recognised that his primary inspiration was the landscape surrounding @entity26 and once said : ' i should paint my own places best '			1
residents are determined to protect the artist 's legacy and have raised concerns that the great artist may have sketched the fields where the homes could be built			1
@entity36 , secretary of the @entity37 , told @entity38 : ' we do n't want a big development dumped down on a corner of the village			0
we would like a modest number of small developments			0
' ' @entity2 wrote , ' those scenes made me a painter and i am grateful			2
' so are we , and we are determined that his legacy will not be lost on our watch			2
' up to 160 homes could be built at the site in @entity19 ( shaded red area ) - just over a mile from @entity53 , where @entity2 painted the @entity3 this is the spot from which @entity2 set up his easel to make preliminary sketches for the @entity3 ( pictured today ) she conceded that the fields were on the opposite side of the village to @entity53 but said that they still deserved to be protected			1
the village sits within the @entity26 and @entity62 - an @entity63 and is 20 minutes from @entity64			0
developers @entity65 and @entity66 have not yet submitted a planning application , as they are waiting for the results of a survey			2
@entity2 recognised that his primary inspiration was the landscape surrounding @entity26 and once said : ' i should paint my own places best ' ' once all the views are taken into account we will submit the application to @entity78 , ' said the developers			1
@entity79 , of the campaign group @entity80 , said : ' we are not against development totally but 144 homes in one hit is absurd			0
' @entity2 completed the @entity3 in 1821 and nearly 200 years on , you can still stand at the exact spot where he set up his easel beside the @entity87 at @entity21			1
the painting was first exhibited at the @entity89 in 1821 , but failed to find a buyer			0
but when it was exhibited in @entity93 , with other paintings by @entity2 , the artist was awarded a @entity95 by @entity96 for many years the @entity21 site has been in the hands of the @entity99 , which organises ' constable country ' tours of @entity21 and the surrounding countryside			1
the mill was once owned by @entity2 's father and the artist made the surrounding area the subject of many of his works			1
@entity2 was largely self - taught , but became a student at the @entity89 schools at the age of 24			0
he exhibited from 1802 at the @entity89 in @entity112 and later at the @entity113 and influenced the @entity114 and the @entity93 romantic movement			0
although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in @entity118 art , @entity2 was never financially successful			0
he did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the @entity89 at the age of 52			0
@entity2 's view on the @entity123 near @entity26 which was completed in 1822			2
