partially - sighted @entity3 , 48 , was already on bail for making bomb threats to five different @entity21 stores and five hospitals when she threatened the @entity23 , a social worker and even her own mother			2
@entity26 was told @entity27 only made the phone calls because of ' uneven flag stones ' in her ' unsuitable ' property and loneliness			1
but judge @entity32 refused to accept her vulnerability as an excuse , telling @entity27 : ' i have absolutely no hesitation at all in naming you as a menace to your community			1
' your actions , in my judgement , are deliberate and designed to cause significant harm and distress throughout the community			0
' @entity3 was sentenced to three - and - a - half years in prison after she admitted nine counts of communicating false information with intent			1
the court heard how she had already faced court action in 2011 after admitting making more than 200 hoax calls to emergency services in @entity53			1
but prosecutor @entity54 today told the court how @entity27 , who is estranged from her children and lives alone in @entity26 , @entity53 , began making a fresh barrage of calls on october 29 last year , ringing @entity21 stores in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity27 whispered down the phone when staff at each store answered that there was a bomb outside the main door of the shop , in the form of a brown paper box			2
calling the @entity62 store , she told them her name was @entity78 and that the bomb would go off in half an hour			0
panicked staff evacuated the store and police were called , but no bomb was found			0
at @entity63 , @entity3 told them her name was @entity84 , before bizarrely telling the staff member she had a young girl with her who was unconscious			0
threats : @entity88 was among the hospitals that @entity3 called claiming there was a bomb in the vicinity ' it ’s my daughter @entity94			2
i ’ve given her ecstasy tablets but she thought they were sweets			0
the ambulance needs to hurry up , she ’s not breathing , ' miss @entity54 described @entity3 telling the staff member			0
the court also heard that she contacted several hospitals and charities , including two to @entity104 , two to @entity88 , one to @entity105 , one to a @entity106 in @entity26 and one to @entity107 in @entity63 , @entity108			2
she sent a mixture of text messages to the hospitals and also made phone calls herself - again threatening that there was a bomb in the vicinity			1
police traced the mobile phone number back to @entity27 , who denied making the calls			2
but while on bail for these offences , she committed further hoax calls on december 7 last year			0
the court heard @entity27 only made the calls because of ' uneven flag stones ' in her ' unsuitable ' property and because she was lonely she again called the @entity88 and @entity127 , as well as voluntary charities including the @entity23 in @entity26 , the @entity129 and even a social worker who had worked with @entity27 in the past			1
text messages read by an automated voice told terrified staff at the @entity127 , which offers rehabilitation for patients over 65 who have come from hospital , that there was a bomb in reception			0
@entity3 rang the hospital to whisper bomb threats down the phone approximately three times			0
she also sent three text messages to her previous support worker telling her there was a bomb in her office			0
as well as ringing hospitals , she also made a four silent phone calls to 999 on december 7 , miss @entity54 told the court			1
she even sent her own mother , @entity153 , five text messages which read ‘ pervert ’			0
again , @entity3 was arrested where she denied sending the messages or making calls but pleaded guilty when she appeared at @entity158 in december			0
jailed : a judge at @entity26 described @entity3 as a ' menace ' to society and jailed her for three - and - a - half - years for nine counts of communicating false information with intent @entity3 , wearing dark glasses and carrying a black stick , was helped into the dock by her barrister @entity168			1
she said the reason @entity27 had made the calls was because the property she is living in is unsuitable because of ' uneven flag stones ' , loneliness and because of ' anger towards her mother '			1
ms @entity168 added : ' she does n’t appear to understand why she behaves in this way ... she says she hates what she does			0
' but judge @entity32 said this did not excuse @entity27 's actions , telling her : ' i make it very clear that your vulnerability in the community and your physical disabilities provide absolutely no excuse for the way in which you deliberately behaved in the course of the commission of these offences			1
' calling the phone calls a ' campaign of bomb hoaxes ' , the judge added : ' suffice to say that one can readily imagine , given the terms of each phone call made , significant alarm , distress and therefore harm being caused			2
' judge @entity32 told @entity27 : ' your targeting of institutions such as hospitals are a significant aggravating factor in this case			1
' members of the public simply going about their lawful business were evacuated from a number of places , no doubt causing them at the very least inconvenience and almost certainly significant alarm and distress			0
