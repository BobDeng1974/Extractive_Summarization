having spent the past two seasons watching @entity3 smash opponents in matches and team - mates in training , @entity0 admits he ’s delighted not to be facing @entity7 ’s exiled no 7 at @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity10 ’s former @entity9 has no doubt his @entity13 colleague , who is unavailable for selection because of the @entity16 ’s policy of not picking overseas - based players , would make @entity20 ’s side a more fearsome proposition			1
@entity7 captain @entity21 will wear the no 7 shirt against the @entity10 though many pundits , including @entity25 columnist sir @entity24 , believe the @entity26 would be better suited at blindside with the destructive , scavenging @entity3 in the pivotal openside position			1
@entity13 's flanker @entity3 has not been selected by @entity7 because he is playing overseas @entity3 has been in good form for @entity13 but will not be selected for @entity7 while playing in @entity31 after spending two seasons alongside @entity3 at @entity13 , where the @entity33 has played a central role in back - to - back @entity36 victories and was last season named @entity39 , @entity0 agrees			1
‘ i ’m very happy i play with @entity3 at @entity13 and in the same breath i ’m very happy i am not playing against him this weekend , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ @entity3 is a quality player who proved last season , not only in the @entity41 but also in the @entity36 , that he would n’t let that @entity33 outfit down			1
@entity21 is set to wear the no 7 shirt but many believe he is better suited to the blindside ‘ the powers that be have certain rules and we have to let that stand but i think he could play a big part in this @entity33 team if he got that opportunity			1
’ @entity3 , 29 , won five caps under @entity55 but has not played for @entity7 since before the last @entity56			1
but he still hopes he could be considered for next autumn ’s @entity56 under the ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ clause in the @entity16 regulations			0
that hope appears slim after @entity61 last week reaffirmed his backing for a selection policy designed to discourage players from moving the @entity31 @entity41 , where average salaries are significantly higher than those in the @entity67			2
@entity3 won five caps for @entity7 when he was playing for @entity69 between 2009 and 2011 ‘ who knows what will happen ? ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ come 10 months ’ time at the start of the @entity56 there might be a case for special inclusion for someone like @entity3 , who really has played an influential part in the success @entity13 have had over the past two or three seasons			1
‘ he ’s playing a brand of rugby that means he should be selected but at this stage @entity7 are adhering to their protocols			1
so i am sad he has not gone on to higher honours this time around and also happy i wo n’t be facing him this time too			2
’ last month @entity86 made an audacious bid to bring @entity3 back across the @entity88 but were thwarted when @entity20 refused to give assurances to the former @entity69 player about his inclusion in @entity7 ’s elite player squad			1
@entity0 prepares for @entity10 's international with @entity7 at @entity8 on saturday @entity0 is unable to stop @entity94 's @entity93 as @entity10 lost their opening tour game in @entity96 ‘ it ’s sad that a player of his calibre is n’t getting exposure at international level , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ he definitely would n’t let that @entity7 jersey down , but unfortunately he chose that option a couple of years ago and has to live by his decision			2
‘ as a player you understand the rules and regulations so when you do decide to take an offer overseas coming from a country where those rules are in place , you fully understand what you ’re getting into			0
‘ i ’ve had chats with @entity3 about it			2
it ’s difficult for him			0
he really loves @entity7 and loved playing for the country			2
‘ it ’s frustrating if you ’ve been playing a level of rugby that sees you named @entity123 player of the year yet are not playing for your international team			0
‘ it could be a little heart - breaking for him , but it ’s a decision he ’s taken and a decision he understands			0
’ @entity127 is expected to be named in the @entity7 side in place of injured @entity130 @entity131 is expected to start for @entity7 despite going off with concussion against @entity133 @entity0 was named to face @entity7 by @entity10 coach @entity134 , who has made five changes to the side who surprisingly lost to @entity94 in @entity96 last saturday			1
@entity138 returns to face @entity21 on the openside flank and half - backs @entity141 and @entity142 are dropped in favour of @entity144 and @entity145			2
@entity134 said : ‘ we ’ve accepted that our performance against @entity94 last weekend was not up to scratch and everyone in the touring squad has put up their hands this week			0
‘ we ’ve really worked hard at fixing the mistakes we made and the challenge now is to put that into action on saturday			0
’ @entity61 names his side on thursday with @entity127 expected to be given his first start on the right wing opposite @entity0 following the withdrawal of @entity130 with injury			2
@entity131 is expected to be named at lock despite having been taken off 23 minutes into saturday ’s defeat against @entity133 suffering concussion following two separate head knocks in the space of four minutes which left him with an egg - sized lump on the side of his head			2
@entity61 is set to persevere with @entity175 and @entity176 in midfield , despite calls to move @entity178 to inside centre and give @entity180 his first start at 10			0
but @entity21 admits his side are under huge pressure following their opening @entity186 series loss to the @entity133			0
he said : ‘ whenever it ’s a tournament or a series you want to start with a win			0
there ’s probably nothing worse than starting a series with a loss			0
so there ’s a huge amount of pressure on the guys to go out and deliver this weekend			0
‘ we ’re not going to wait for the physicality and intensity which i ’m sure these guys will bring			0
being at home we want to impose ourselves and get back on track			0
’ the autumn internationals on @entity206 are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international , @entity123 and domestic game .			0

@entity3 has not been selected by @entity7 since moving to @entity13 from @entity69 in 2011
@entity0 says he is pleased not to be facing his @entity13 team - mate @entity3 this weekend despite thinking he should play for @entity7
@entity7 face @entity10 at @entity8 on saturday
