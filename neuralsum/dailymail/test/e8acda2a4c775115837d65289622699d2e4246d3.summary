a mere 53 hours to kick - off and all is serene at the training base of @entity3			1
mowers clip along on distant pitches as the sun beats down and the whitewashed pavilion is brightened by pots of forget - me - nots , a flower which could be adopted as the emblem of relegation			1
@entity3 boss @entity13 appears relaxed and untroubled , insisting he had more sleepless nights coaching @entity15 last season and joking about the difference between @entity18 and @entity19			2
his job is to chase pressure and negativity away at times like this , but beneath the surface fear tightens its grip on those near the drop zone			2
@entity3 boss @entity13 ( centre ) is one of seven managers trying to keep their club in the @entity31 @entity13 's side host @entity33 on saturday as they look to climb out of the relegation zone with four games left @entity37 ' 88th minute strike saw @entity38 grab a late 1 - 0 win at @entity3 earlier this month it will be the same at @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
even at @entity46 , where @entity47 was keen on thursday to stress his club feel no pressure because their financial commitments are so much less than their rivals			1
‘ we are probably half the wage bill of the next team in the division , let alone all the superpowers , and half the spending of the next team in the division , ’ said @entity47			2
the financial implications are bigger for others but there still exists a fear of sporting failure , a fear of letting people down , a fear of losing your job , your status , security , your self - esteem			2
these everyday , human anxieties trouble @entity31 footballers , too			1
when @entity37 celebrated @entity38 ’s winner in the 88th minute at @entity75 two weeks ago , @entity13 curled into a ball on the touchline and bottled up his fury until he was well clear of the dressing room			2
‘ it was old - school , ’ he smiled			2
‘ i was a little bit angry			2
i was so disappointed , probably the most disappointed i ’ve been			2
it was a very soft goal and it would have given us a massive lift to know we could compete with a team of that calibre			2
’ four of the bottom seven did not play in the @entity31 last weekend and watched helplessly as @entity43 won again , tightening the pack			1
@entity46 manager @entity47 says his side have had to compete with the smallest wage budget in the league @entity41 @entity91 ( home ) - april 25 @entity43 ( away ) - may 2 @entity93 ( home ) - may 9 @entity3 ( away ) - may 16 @entity33 ( home ) - may 24 @entity42 @entity96 ( away ) - april 25 @entity97 ( home ) - may 2 @entity33 ( home ) - may 9 @entity99 ( away ) - may 16 @entity46 ( home ) - may 24 @entity44 @entity101 ( away ) - april 25 @entity99 ( home ) - may 2 @entity97 ( away ) - may 9 @entity43 ( home ) - may 16 @entity104 ( away ) - may 20 @entity38 ( away ) - may 24 @entity45 @entity105 ( away ) - april 25 @entity106 ( home ) - april 28 @entity104 ( home ) - may 2 @entity46 ( home ) - may 9 @entity15 ( away ) - may 16 @entity110 ( home ) - may 24 @entity43 @entity46 ( away ) - april 25 @entity38 ( home ) - april 29 @entity41 ( home ) - may 2 @entity99 ( home ) - may 9 @entity44 ( away ) - may 16 @entity3 ( home ) - may 24 @entity3 @entity33 ( home ) - april 25 @entity106 ( away ) - may 2 @entity96 ( away ) - may 9 @entity41 ( home ) - may 16 @entity43 ( away ) - may 24 @entity46 @entity43 ( home ) - april 25 @entity33 ( away ) - may 2 @entity45 ( away ) - may 9 @entity101 ( home ) - may 16 @entity42 ( away ) - may 24 note : fixtures in may subject to change for television schedule			1
having reached the point where all seemed lost , perhaps the pressure left @entity127 ’s team			2
they have won three on the bounce			2
now , off the bottom at last , it will get tense again as they head for @entity134			1
@entity127 said : ‘ i ’m delighted			2
it ’s a very difficult feat to achieve for any side , let alone one on the foot of the table			1
but we ’re not in a position to sit back and enjoy it			1
‘ my perspective is that we ’re still in the bottom three			1
the danger is there ’s an assumption the hard work is done			2
’ @entity44 ’s @entity148 and @entity3 ’s @entity13 have fixed their survival targets at 35 points			1
@entity45 ’s @entity151 thinks he might get away with 34			2
at @entity41 , @entity152 has 35 and is still uneasy			1
@entity153 was on the scoresheet as @entity43 beat @entity91 2 - 0 in the @entity31 on april 18 that win elevated @entity127 's ( right ) side off the bottom of the table and into 18th in the @entity31 @entity41 manager @entity152 believes his team need four points from five games to avoid relegation how the league form table looks like as of april 23 ‘ you can never tell , ’ said @entity152			1
‘ for me , we need four points from five games			1
’ @entity44 were last year ’s @entity167 : bottom with six to play and doomed according to many by virtue of a daunting fixture list			1
then they drew at @entity96 , won at @entity38 and @entity110 and then beat relegation rivals @entity173 and @entity93			2
they lost the last game and still finished in 14th , five points clear , helped by @entity178 ’s burst of five goals in three games			1
@entity178 has scored only four since - no - one at @entity44 has more in the @entity31 this season — and these acts of escapology are more difficult without a goal supply			1
@entity185 with eight in seven has boosted @entity42			2
‘ for him to be at a club fighting at the bottom is a mismatch , ’ said @entity186 , but @entity42 still require points as they head to @entity96			1
@entity3 have 17 - goal @entity191			0
will he be enough ? @entity46 have @entity193 , almost out of contract and without a goal in more than two months			1
@entity45 ’s top scorer @entity196 is injured			0
the cost of relegation is estimated at £ 60million by football finance expert professor @entity199 of @entity200			0
@entity178 scored five goals in three games last season to help @entity44 avoid relegation ‘ we normally say promotion is worth £ 100 - 120m , ’ said professor @entity199			1
‘ relegation is harder to quantify			0
clubs wo n’t get the full tv rights payment which is about £ 80m but they will get parachute payments			1
sponsors pay a premium for the @entity31 and those deals will end and salaries can quickly eat up this smaller revenue if there are no clauses to reduce wages or allow a quick sale			1
‘ for a club ’s first season in the championship it ’s in the region of a £ 60m direct cut in revenue			0
’ fates unknown , clubs sketch out alternative recruitment strategies			1
@entity3 have a dozen players out of contract and , should they go down , @entity232 penalties are pending for breaking @entity230 rules last season			0
@entity191 has scored 17 goals in the league for @entity3 this season - but they still find themselves in 19th relegated clubs will receive a parachute payment of £ 25m next season , followed by £ 20m in 2016 - 17 and two more of £ 10m if they do not go back up , as fewer seem to do			1
no team has bounced straight back with automatic promotion from the @entity223 since @entity41 and @entity93 in 2010			0
@entity33 and @entity3 rebounded via the play - offs and @entity245 are in the race this year			0
the championship is an unforgiving pit to fall into , with 17 managerial sackings this season and an average tenure of less than a year			0
‘ football has its own laws , ’ said @entity13			0
‘ i ’d be shopping in @entity18 instead of @entity19			0
i ’ll have a different shopping basket if i look at it from a personal point of view			0
’ it 's truly squeaky bum time in the @entity31 relegation battle as just nine points separates the bottom seven teams			1
@entity262 asks some of the managers in and among the dog fight what they feel is required for them to avoid the drop this season			0
@entity13 ( @entity3 ) ' if we win three games i think we will stay up			1
i 'm not saying that 's the definitive amount - but we really need to start winning , starting with this weekend			0
to do that , we need to concentrate right to the end and make sure that our performances stay similar with a bit more defensive resilience			0
' @entity3 manager @entity13 ( centre ) feels they will avoid relegation if they win three more league games @entity186 ( @entity42 ) ' i do n't know how many points it will take			1
nothing 's been achieved yet			0
i 'm a new voice and given them a lot of belief and confidence that they are better than what they were showing			0
they have managed to score a few more goals and have real belief they can go to places and win			0
something was probably a little bit missing previously			0
i want to make sure that i do n't take my foot off pedal			0
i 'll make sure the players do n't			0
' @entity186 ( left ) believes his appointment at @entity42 has given them a lot of belief and confidence @entity127 ( @entity43 ) ' we 've put ourselves in a position now where we have a more realistic chance			0
that 's where we are			0
if it raises optimism elsewhere , fine			0
if it applies a bit more pressure on other sides around us , fine also			0
but as far as i 'm concerned it 's about making sure we 're back to business when we play @entity46			1
because it 's a really big game for both sides			0
we 've got players in decent form			0
we want to keep the work ethic that we 've shown all season			0
' @entity43 manager @entity127 ( right ) hopes his side can continue their momentum against @entity46 @entity47 ( @entity46 ) ' the biggest psychological difference is that others are talking about relegation			1
our fuel is about staying in the @entity31			1
it 's a slightly different twist			0
' others are scared of relegation			0
we 're not scared of relegation because we were told by everyone we were going to get relegated			0
we are actually looking for the goal of being in the @entity31			1
' @entity47 insists his side are n't scared of relegation as a lot of people have written them off in the past			0

just nine points separates the bottom seven clubs in the @entity31
@entity46 sit bottom of the table on 26 points after 33 games in the league
*newcastle* are 14th in the table on 35 points with five games remaining
