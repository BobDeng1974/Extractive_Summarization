by @entity0 published : 01:10 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 2 september 2012 x-factor : @entity2 told a national radio show host last month that he had once burned up the marathon track in less than three hours @entity2 has been forced into a humiliating u-turn over claims he was an unusually fast long - distance runner			2
a red - faced @entity2 admitted on saturday he did n't run a marathon in under three hours , as he boasted last month on a nationally broadcast radio interview			2
the conservative congressman acknowledged he misstated his time by more than an hour			1
it turns out the @entity12 hopeful conveniently rounded his time down - to three hours - instead of up - to four hours			1
the only problem is someone was , indeed , keeping track of this track feat. the @entity17 only corrected the record after @entity19 unearthed evidence he had completed a single marathon in 1990 , and finished in just over four hours			2
that time stands in stark contrast to what @entity2 had previously said , when he proudly bragged to radio host @entity26 that he had run a ' two hour and fifty - something ' marathon			1
that would make for a pace of less than 7 minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed for recreational runners			0
back - tracking : a red - faced @entity2 admitted saturday that had rounded his time down to about three hours instead of the mark he actually recorded , which is closer to four ' under three , high twos			1
i had a two hour and fifty - something , ' @entity2 reportedly told @entity26 , to which the shocked radio - man expressed reportedly exclaimed , ' holy smokes			1
' ' i was fast when i was younger , yeah , ' @entity43 's running - mate quipped in reply			2
the @entity2 campaign told @entity19 that the @entity46 ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old			0
that was the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51			0
the running magazine reports he finished in 4 hours , 1 minute , and 25 seconds			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity53 provided @entity54 with this statement from his boss : ' the race was more than 20 years ago , but my brother @entity58 - who ran @entity59 last year - reminds me that he is the owner of the fastest marathon in the family and has never himself ran a sub-three			0
' if i were to do any rounding , it would certainly be to four hours , not three			0
he gave me a good ribbing over this at dinner tonight			0
' @entity54 asked @entity53 why @entity2 made it sound as if he had run more than one marathon , but @entity53 only responded to confirm it was just a single race			0
it turns out @entity2 is slower than @entity69 , but faster than @entity70			1
@entity69 reportedly has a best time of 3:59 ; @entity72 has run 3:30 and @entity73 has run 3:44 , while @entity70 trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58 .			1

@entity12 vice presidential hopeful misstated his mark by more than an hour
@entity81 @entity80 's time is still better than @entity70 's *...* but slower than @entity69 's
