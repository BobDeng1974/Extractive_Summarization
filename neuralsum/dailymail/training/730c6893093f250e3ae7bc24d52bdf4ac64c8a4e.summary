a police inquiry has been launched into the deaths of a number of patients who were treated by colorectal surgeon @entity5 police are investigating the deaths of at least three @entity10 patients operated on by a cancer surgeon			1
@entity5 , 44 , had double the death rate of other doctors while working as a consultant general surgeon at @entity15 and the @entity16 , @entity17			1
one in five of his patients had to be readmitted after procedures he carried out , according to a report by the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			0
he was referred to the @entity23 in july 2012 after colleagues raised concerns about his work as a colon and bowel keyhole surgery specialist			1
but while he was being investigated he was still allowed to continue operating for several months on patients – all unaware of concerns over his performance – until he was eventually suspended in october the same year			1
he remains excluded from his post in @entity37 , which he had held since august 2011 , while the @entity38 has placed restrictions on his licence to practise surgery			0
but a hotline for patients and families was opened only last june by @entity45			1
a coroner was due to hold a joint inquest in the deaths of three of his patients , @entity49 , 84 , @entity51 , 81 , and @entity52 , 80 , who died in 2012 after being operated on by mr @entity5			1
the inquest has now been adjourned pending the investigation by @entity55			1
mr @entity5 worked at @entity16 in @entity17 as well as the @entity15 ( pictured ) superintendent @entity56 said the @entity55 force was liaising with key partner agencies after receiving a letter raising concerns in december 2013 it is also feared it may be widened to look at ‘ a small number ’ of other patient deaths			1
superintendent @entity56 said the investigation began after police received a letter in december last year			1
he said : ‘ we were made aware that there were a number of concerns in relation to the deaths of patients in 2012 who had been under mr @entity5 ’s care			1
we are in the early stages of obtaining the relevant information			0
‘ we can not be specific about numbers at this time but can confirm the deaths of three patients whose joint inquest was adjourned in december 2013 form part of this inquiry			2
‘ the families of those people have been informed			0
’ the @entity45 said it acted as soon as it was aware of a ‘ potential problem ’ by calling in the @entity23 , whose report found mr @entity5 had double the percentage death rate of doctors carrying out similar procedures and triple the number of readmissions			1
the @entity45 has reviewed the records of hundreds of patients undergoing major procedures for bowel cancer , some of whom have been recalled for checks			2
there is also a separate review under way of all patients in contact with mr @entity5 , even for minor procedures			2
dozens of patients have made complaints and some families have instructed lawyers to take up their cases			0
@entity115 , a partner at the @entity116 , a medical negligence law firm , said : ‘ there ’s a real danger that the victims who have come forward already are just the tip of the iceberg			0
his work impacted the lives of hundreds , if not thousands of families			0
‘ spotting cancer early is the best way to improve the chances of successful treatment , but it ’s clear he failed to do this for many of his patients			0
‘ the news that the police are investigating too suggests that this case goes beyond mere negligence			0
’ it is understood mr @entity5 remains on his full £ 85,000 - a - year salary			2
a spokesman for @entity45 said : ‘ we would like to reassure patients and their relatives that as soon as it became aware there was a potential problem the @entity45 acted swiftly and responsibly to protect its patients			2
‘ an expert multidisciplinary team has reviewed the medical records of all his patients who had undergone a major operation			0
patients we were concerned about were recalled for further assessment			0
‘ a separate review of all patients who had any contact with mr @entity5 is being performed by a team of specialist external surgeons			0

@entity55 said investigation concerns deaths of patients formerly under the care of colorectal surgeon @entity5
@entity45 said it was *cooperating* fully with the police inquiry , which is examining at least three deaths
an earlier *version* of this article *wrongly* said that @entity5 worked for more than a year after concerns were first raised in june 2012 . in fact his work was supervised from july and he was excluded by his @entity45 in october that year .
