by @entity0 these stunning images were captured in the blink of an eye - literally			0
former engineer - turned - photographer @entity4 used a high - speed camera to record the moment a gun fires a bullet straight through the heart of a falling water droplet			1
the whole process took just 28 milliseconds , from the moment the gun was fired to the time the shot was taken - and the shot was perfectly engineered to make the image as precise and uniform as possible			1
this image was taken by 56 - year - old @entity18 photographer @entity4			1
it captures the moment a bullet passes through three drops of water , filmed using different coloured lights			1
the image was shot using a high - speed camera and shutter that was automatically triggered when the gun was fired @entity4 ’s droplet shots are part of a range of photographs that capture bullets travelling through objects			1
the 56 - year - old has previously caught the moment a bullet breaks a water balloon , smashes through a lit lightbulb and destroys a stack of dice			1
to take such precise shots , @entity42 ’s uses a pool of water that is lit from various angles , with coloured lights used to add hues to the drops			2
he begins by placing water in a time - release valve above a pool of water below			0
as the drop leaves the valve it hits the pool			0
when this drop reaches a certain point , the gun is set to fire automatically , which in turn triggers the camera ’s flash and shutter			2
the former engineer built the system himself and the whole process takes just 28 milliseconds from the moment the gun is fired to the time the shot is taken			1
as a result each shot is perfectly engineered to make the images as precise and uniform as possible			0
the reflection also creates a mirror effect to take such precise shots , @entity42 's uses a pool of water that is lit from various angles , with coloured lights used to add hues to the drops			2
he begins by placing water in a time - release valve above a pool of water below			0
as the drop leaves the valve it hits the pool @entity4 told @entity93 that the system takes ‘ a few hours ’ to setup , but once constructed each shot is ‘ spot on , due to the precise level of control			1
’ but , despite this level of control , @entity4 takes hundreds of images on any given experiment before selecting his favourites			2
@entity4 took up photography in 1976 and mostly shot black and white images which he developed and printed himself			2
he has also captured microscopic images of crystals , from sugar to paracetamol and @entity109 , and created images of women and animals using smoke			0
more of @entity42 's photographs can be viewed on his website			0

the 56 - year - old took up photography in 1976 and mostly shot black and white images , which he developed and printed himself			1
he has also captured microscopic images of crystals , from sugar to paracetamol , and created images of women and animals using smoke last year , slow motion film experts filmed themselves firing guns underwater for the first time to show the mini tornadoes and unusual shapes created by the weapons			0
@entity143 and @entity144 , who are known on @entity145 as @entity146 , made the video to show the differing effects that two guns created in a freezing swimming pool			0
after being triggered , a tornado forms at the end of both guns for a few short seconds before the bullets sink down to the bottom of the pool and surrounding bubbles float to the surface .			0

the photos were taken by 56 - year - old @entity18 photographer @entity4
each of the images capture the moment a bullet passes through a *carefully* timed , falling droplet of water
@entity42 manages to catch the *physical* break between the top of the droplet and the water in the pool below
they were shot using a high - speed camera and shutter which was automatically triggered when the gun was fired
the former engineer built the system himself and the whole process takes just 28 milliseconds
