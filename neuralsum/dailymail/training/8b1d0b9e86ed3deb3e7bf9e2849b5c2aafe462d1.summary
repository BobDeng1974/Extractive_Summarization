a tax could be put on fizzy drinks and biscuits could be emblazoned with health warnings in a new strategy to slash the nation ’s sugar intake			1
a report commissioned by a government agency says that targeting soft drinks would be an easy option in the war on sugar			2
it estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks – which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p – would cut the number of overweight @entity18 by more than a quarter of a million			1
health secretary @entity19 is under pressure to hike fizzy drinks ' cost to tackle the growing obesity crisis the leaked paper , which was written by heart doctors and health researchers , comes just weeks after the chief medical officer dame @entity27 warned that a ‘ sugar tax ’ may be necessary to tackle the country ’s obesity epidemic			1
figures show that @entity18 girls are the fattest in @entity33 , with almost a third overweight or obese			0
around two thirds of adults are overweight or obese			0
the ‘ options for action ’ document , which was prepared for @entity54 , identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake : a tax on sugary drinks ; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar ; a cut in portion sizes ; advertising rules being tightened ; health warnings on sugary products ; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet			1
the draft report describes sugary soft drinks as ‘ low - hanging fruit ’ – or an easy target – and says a 20 per cent sugar tax would reduce obesity rates by 1.3 per cent			1
it argues that the move would have public support , ‘ especially when health benefits are emphasised ’			0
the paper , obtained by @entity67 , is expected to form the basis of a report to be published on june 26			0
@entity54 said the government had asked for its advice but any decision would lie with ministers			0
the @entity74 said it currently had no plans for a sugar tax			2
@entity77 ( left ) , is a new naturally - sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than regular fizzy drinks and will be launched in the new year			2
but health campaigners say people need to learn how to enjoy drinks that do not taste sweet - whether loaded with sugar or sweeteners - because at the moment we are ' drinking spoonfuls of sugar ' , as the shock image on the right represents a can of @entity93 or @entity94 contains nine teaspoons of sugar - or 35g			1
this is almost half of the maximum recommended daily intake of sugar our diets could be improved by listening to the right kind of music , scientists claim			2
researchers from @entity107 claim high - pitched tones trick the brain into thinking a food is sweeter than it really is , while low notes enhance bitter tastes			0
they said a dish could be made to taste up to 10 per cent sweeter through ‘ sonic seasoning ’ , meaning less sugar was needed .			0
