by @entity0 @entity2 motorsport boss @entity1 feels @entity3 has proven he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this year 's @entity7 title fight following his @entity10 @entity9 win			1
in the wake of @entity3 's misjudgement during qualifying at @entity14 , three - times champion sir @entity11 suggested the 29 - year - old 's head ' certainly seems to have gone a bit '			1
just 24 hours later @entity3 , starting from sixth on the grid and with @entity2 team - mate @entity19 on pole , responded to his back - to - the - wall situation by claiming a crucial victory			1
far from @entity40 cracking , @entity1 said : ' different to what the perception is he is mentally very strong and he has coped well with problems			0
' on saturday night he showed a very mature , stable way of tackling things , and then in the briefing on the morning of the race he was very focused , very concentrated in a way that was really impressive			0
' another example is during the race he had a pit stop that was n't perfect , but the first thing he did was to get on to the radio and say to the guys ' do n't worry , let 's make the next one better '			0
' you can see within the team there is no blame culture , it 's about trying to improve together			0
mind games : @entity2 boss @entity1 , pictured with @entity61 ( r ) , says @entity3 proved his mental strength ' so he would have lifted himself out of his low anyway , but winning at home in front of such a crowd will have given him a big boost			1
' when you are at home it does give you that extra boost , seeing the fans cheer			0
' even if you do n't hear it in the car , i strongly believe in energy , and there was definitely energy behind @entity3 at @entity14			1
' conversely , @entity1 concedes the same could now happen for @entity19 as he heads into his home grand prix at @entity81 next weekend			2
' it could be the opposite in @entity38 and the energy could be behind @entity19 because it 's home turf for him , ' said @entity1			2
@entity84 to bumper : @entity3 is only four points behind teammate @entity19 in the title chase with six one - twos scored by @entity3 and @entity19 this season , @entity1 knows there would be no better place to chalk up number seven than on home soil for @entity2 , with their headquarters in @entity96 just 80 miles away			1
' we 've already had a couple of home races , ' said @entity1			0
' we had @entity100 ( home of title sponsor @entity103 ) , then a bit of a home race in @entity106 ( @entity1 and non-executive chairman @entity61 were born there )			0
' then we had our home race at @entity14 , and next is @entity81 near @entity96 where the mother company lives			1
' that 's the real home race , and it will be so important to score a good result , with a one - two what we will be trying to achieve			0
' @entity113 triumphs at @entity14			2
