relatives of @entity2 victim @entity1 who were put under observation by @entity4 after they visited him on the day he was taken to hospital are still waiting for an answer about what they should do 24 hours after they begged them for help			1
@entity10 , 43 , and wife @entity11 , 35 , yesterday told of their ordeal in isolation and revealed that they had not received direct orders to stay indoors			1
today @entity15 returned to the family 's small apartment to find a family without answers , without power following violent electrical storms that brought down lines and running low on food , water and diapers for their youngest child			1
they have no power , can not go out for food and the waste - including soiled nappies , is piling up most troubling of all some family members are beginning to show cold - like symptoms			1
ms @entity11 repeatedly wiped her eyes - which appeared sticky - with a paper towel while a child sneezed and coughed in the background			1
while it is unlikely to be related to the ebola virus , they did not look as healthy as they did when @entity15 visited on thursday			0
ms @entity11 said : ' we asked the @entity4 last night if we have to stay indoors and they said they would come back to us overnight and tell us this morning			1
' the @entity4 had been in contact with them over the last few says , checking their temperatures and blood pressures			2
but it was close to midday when @entity11 spoke and the family was still waiting for officials to visit and answer their questions from thursday			2
the couple live in the home with their four children : three boys aged two , four and 11 and a daughter , aged six			2
she continued : ' our phone is not working because of the storm			0
so we do n't know			0
' @entity15 contacted @entity4 officials on behalf of the family after our visit to their home			1
an official said she would pass on the information			0
the family has also had no instruction about how to dispose of the waste already accumulating in their small second floor apartment			0
the waste , which may be contaminated , includes soiled diapers			0
@entity2 is only contagious when the infected person is exhibiting symptoms			2
but it can then be transmitted by an exchange of body fluids including blood , saliva , semen and feces if contact is at a point of entry like a cut or graze , mouth , nose or eyes			0
the entire family had exposure to mr @entity1 during the time when he was exhibiting increasingly violent symptoms and now they feel as if they 've been cast adrift			2
ms @entity11 , mr @entity1 â€™s stepdaughter , said that she last spoke with her quarantined mother , @entity96 , yesterday before the storms cut them off entirely			1
she said : ' she was well			0
she said the @entity4 had come and taken their temperature and it was all normal			2
' finally : hazmat teams move into the apartment where @entity1 was staying when he fell sick - five days after he was taken to hospital vomiting with the ebola virus horror : @entity11 was at the apartment on sunday when @entity1 took a serious turn for the worse			1
she brought him a cup of tea while he was lying in bed on friday afternoon hazmat teams were moving into the apartment where @entity1 had been staying to finally clean it			1
@entity96 had complained that his sweat - stained sheets were still on the bed and the towels he used in plastic bags			0
ms @entity11 last saw her mother when she visited the @entity118 , now quarantined under armed guard on sunday			1
she told the @entity120 that she found @entity1 in bed , fully dressed and shivering			2
after going to buy him a blanket , she helped lift him by his back so the man she calls ' @entity125 ' could drink some hot tea she made him			2
it was then she noticed redness in his eyes , a well - recognized sign of @entity2			1
with his temperature at @entity134 , ms @entity11 who , like her husband mr @entity10 is a nursing assistant , called 911			0
when the ambulance arrived ms @entity11 brought the blanket in which she had wrapped her stepfather to the hospital			1
mr @entity10 yesterday told @entity15 his own brief conversation with his friend that day			0
he said : ' the last time i saw @entity1 was sunday , the day he went to hospital			1
i had seen him after he went to hospital the first time and he was looking fine , he had been just fine			0
' but that day i passed by on sunday he was lying down on the bed in the room and i asked him how he was			0
he said , " i 'm not okay			0
" family : @entity11 calls @entity125			0
he is married to her mother @entity96 , who is in quarantine ' he said he had been having diarrhea all night			0
' mr @entity1 was diagnosed on tuesday , and mr @entity10 said that he was told the news the very day he was supposed to go back to work at the @entity155 home where he works as a nursing assistant .			1

@entity11 , 35 , said @entity4 had not been keeping them informed
@entity11 said she had asked for help yesterday but had not yet got a reply
@entity11 , whose eyes appeared sticky and whose children were coughing , saw @entity2 victim @entity1 on sunday when he was taken to hospital
@entity11 cared for @entity1 - who is her stepfather - to - be . she had touched him when she pushed him by his back to give him some tea
they *'re* now stuck inside their home among waste , little food and no power
