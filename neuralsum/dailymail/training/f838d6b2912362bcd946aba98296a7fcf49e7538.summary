by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 last night imposed the toughest sanctions against @entity4 since the @entity5 , sending the rouble into a tailspin and prompting warnings that @entity10 firms will be hit hard			1
@entity12 leaders agreed unanimously to embargoes against vast sectors of the @entity4 economy , designed to cripple its banks , energy firms and defence capabilities			2
@entity4 will face sweeping new sanctions in response to its alleged support of rebel militants in east @entity24			1
two diplomats told the @entity38 the measures were decided today at a meeting of @entity12 ambassadors			0
a further eight @entity4 will also face asset freezes and travel bans			1
the new @entity12 sanctions came as @entity45 , @entity28 secretary of state , warned that @entity46 is also drawing up fresh sanctions against its old enemy			1
' we are in the process of preparing additional sanctions , with @entity2 , ' mr @entity45 told reporters , shortly after meeting with new @entity24 foreign minister @entity53 at the @entity54			1
but he added that @entity4 president @entity26 ' still has a choice going forward with respect to his ability to be able to have an impact with the separatists			2
' @entity2 's arms embargo will block any trade with @entity4 in weapons or ' related material '			1
with its own major arms industry stemming from the era of @entity5 isolation , @entity4 has little need to import weapons from the @entity12 , but sells more than 3billion euros worth a year to member states			1
however , the embargo will apply only to future contracts , so one big deal that wo n't be affected is the heavily criticised 1.2billion - euro sale of two @entity74 helicopter carriers to @entity4 , which has already been agreed			1
the @entity12 's banking curbs are a more significant step			2
they will deny @entity4 's state - owned banks access to @entity2 capital markets by banning @entity2 from buying their bonds , equities or financial instruments with a higher maturity than 90 days			1
last year nearly half the bonds issued by @entity4 's state - run financial institutions were traded in the @entity12 's financial markets , according to @entity87			1
@entity88 reported that mr @entity45 also revealed he had again raised concerns over @entity4 's role in stirring unrest in eastern @entity24 during a telephone call tuesday with his @entity4 counterpart @entity93			1
@entity4 has denied supporting the separatists , but mr @entity45 maintained that he and mr @entity93 had ' agreed that there is a way to try to put some very specific proposals on the table to try to move forward			1
' high - level diplomacy : @entity24 foreign minister @entity53 , left , and @entity28 secretary of state @entity45 arrive to speak to reporters after a bilateral meeting at the @entity54 in @entity46 over the weekend , @entity28 officials released what they say are images of @entity4 artillery firing from inside their country on @entity24 military positions			1
' president @entity26 can make a huge difference here if he chooses to , and we and our @entity2 partners will take additional measures and impose wider sanctions on key sections of the @entity4 economy if that is what we must do , ' mr @entity45 said			1
' we hope that it will not be necessary			0
and if @entity4 continues to go down this path , however , @entity4 will leave the international community with no choice			1
' mr @entity45 again pointed out the difficulties being faced by international investigators trying to gain access to the site where a @entity128 airliner was downed 10 days ago , killing all 298 people on board			1
' without this access , they have no way to collect debris , no way to collect other evidence from the scene in order to be able to provide the kind of examination that is necessary , ' he was quoted as saying by @entity88			0
' they still ca n't even ensure that all of the victims ' remains have been removed , and that is an unsupportable burden for any family to have to bear , and it is an unacceptable standard for behaviour			0
' the site has to be cordoned off , the evidence has to be preserved , and @entity4 needs to use its considerable influence among the separatists in order to be able to help ensure this basic approach of common decency			2
' this is @entity2 : a woman stands in front of an apartment block in @entity160 , east @entity24 , which was hit by shells fired by government forces as they make a concerted push to retake the town from separatists firefighters try to extinguish fires after homes and vehicles were destroyed by shelling in @entity160 as mr @entity45 spoke , shells smashed into a residential neighbourhood of @entity172 as @entity24 forces intensified their campaign to encircle the rebel stronghold			1
the shelling killed at least two people , blew gaping holes in an apartment block and raised fears that the city is on the verge of severe bloodshed			2
fighting also raged elsewhere in @entity24 's troubled east , bringing the death toll to at least 24 civilians and 10 soldiers over the past day			1
and it prevented international investigators once again from visiting the site of the @entity193 jet shot down earlier this month			2
the increased danger to civilians has brought sharp criticism from the @entity197 and human rights groups			0
but the @entity38 reports that each side blames the other for shelling residential areas			0
the rebels insist the attacks are evidence of what they describe as the government 's indiscriminate oppression of its own people			0
but @entity24 insists that it has banned the use of artillery in residential areas and in turn accuses separatists of targeting civilians in an effort to discredit the army			2
medics treat people who were wounded in shelling in @entity160 , which is under siege by @entity24 forces a man is moved from a stretcher on to a bed at the hospital , where 17 people have been killed by the shelling elderly women lie on the floor at the now - overcrowded hospital in @entity160 the @entity172 shelling sent about 50 frightened residents to huddle for safety in an underground parking lot , including @entity235 who was distraught at discovering that her husband @entity236 had been killed			2
... an old woman told me , " look , there is a man lying there			0
" i did n't even think that could be my husband			0
but then i saw the shoes ; they were his shoes , " she tearfully told an @entity38 reporter			0
' do you understand ? his shoes ! my @entity249 , i lived with him for 45 years ; he was such a good person			0
' in @entity160 , a city besieged by government troops , the mayor 's office reported tuesday that 17 people , including three children , were killed as a result of shelling			0
the mayor 's office said there has been major damage to many homes and government offices in the centre of the city			0
it also said the top floor of a school was destroyed as a result of a direct hit from a shell			0
people hide in the basement of their apartment block which they have converted into a bomb shelter a woman covers her ears as others bury their faces in their hands as shells rain down on @entity160 a @entity197 monitoring mission in @entity24 says there has been an alarming build up of heavy weaponry in civilian areas of @entity172 and @entity284 - including artillery , tanks , rockets and missiles that are being used to inflict increasing casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure			2
the @entity197 said in a report this week that use of such weaponry could amount to a violation of international humanitarian law			0
' there is an increase in the use of heavy weaponry in areas that are basically surrounded by public buildings , ' said @entity302 , head of the @entity197 office that oversees @entity24			2
' all international law needs to be applied and fully respected			0
' @entity306 - based @entity305 has been more categorical in its accusations against the government and last week produced what it said was evidence the army had fired on houses in the suburbs of @entity172			0
the overall death toll has been steadily rising			0
the @entity197 has said that at least 1,129 people were killed between mid-april , when fighting began , and july 26 .			0

arms embargo will only apply to future contracts , meaning sale will go ahead
but it will block 3billion euros worth of @entity4 arms sales to @entity2 a year
@entity4 state - owned banks banned from issuing long - term debt in @entity2
eight more @entity4 also face asset freezes and travel bans in @entity2
