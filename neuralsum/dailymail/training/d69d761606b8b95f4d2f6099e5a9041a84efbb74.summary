by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:23 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 07:54 est , 1 may 2012 swipe : speaker @entity2 ordered the prime minister to respond to an urgent question from @entity5 @entity6 took an extraordinary swipe at speaker @entity2 tonight after being dragged to the @entity9 to answer more questions over the @entity12 affair			1
the prime minister was said to be ‘ furious ’ at having been made to scrap plans for a local election speech on the economy after speaker @entity2 ordered him to respond to an urgent question from @entity5			1
it is thought to be the first time a prime minister has been forced to answer an urgent question since @entity21 in 2002 , over the firefighters ’ dispute			1
in an angry appearance , mr @entity6 insisted mr @entity12 – whose career is hanging in the balance over his dealings with @entity29 ’s media empire – had already answered @entity30 ’ questions in an emergency statement last week , while he had addressed the issue in prime minister ’s questions			1
he restated the position he outlined over the weekend , saying he did not believe the @entity36 had broken ministerial rules but opening the door to a @entity40 inquiry or his dismissal if further damaging evidence emerges when he appears at the @entity44 inquiry			1
@entity45 confirmed that mr @entity6 decided not to sack mr @entity12 , for now , without seeing email or text exchanges between him and his special adviser @entity48 , who resigned last week			1
officials said that as both men are appearing as witness at the @entity44 inquiry , they are not allowed to share evidence			2
but they insisted mr @entity6 had sought assurances from mr @entity12 that nothing incriminating was contained in the messages , which will be handed to @entity44			1
a defiant @entity6 condemned mr @entity63 for ' trying to use the @entity69 for party political purposes '			1
mr @entity63 claimed the @entity36 had committed three breaches of the ministerial code but mr @entity6 needed the cabinet minister to survive for his own protection			1
' the prime minister is defending the indefensible and he knows it , ' mr @entity63 said			1
' protecting the @entity36 's job while up and down the country hundreds of thousands are losing theirs			2
' mr @entity12 's former special adviser @entity48 , who quit last week , ' had to go to protect the culture secretary ' , mr @entity63 said			1
but he added : ' the culture secretary has to stay to protect the prime minister			2
on the attack : @entity63 insisted the prime minister was keeping @entity12 in a job to deflect attention away from his own relationship with @entity29 's empire ' the prime minister has shown today he is incapable of doing his duty : too close to a powerful few , out of touch with everyone else.but mr @entity6 dismissed the attack as ' weak and wrong '			1
@entity5 pressed for the issue to be referred to the independent adviser on ministerial interests , sir @entity96			1
but mr @entity6 insisted that it would be wrong to launch a separate investigation into mr @entity12 's actions unless new evidence emerged from the @entity69			1
he said : ' as was made clear in his statement last wednesday , in every respect with regard to the @entity68 bid , the @entity36 asked for independent advice and acted on it			2
smiling in face of adversity : @entity12 ' he was not required to ask or to follow such advice , but he did so			1
' he acted fairly and impartially and in line with the advice of his permanent secretary			0
mr @entity6 added : ' i have seen no evidence to suggest that in handling this issue the @entity116 acted in any way that was contrary to the ministerial code			1
' commons speaker @entity2 approved an urgent question tabled by @entity5 demanding to know why the issue of mr @entity12 's links to @entity68 has not been handed to independent adviser on ministerial interests , sir @entity96			1
@entity125 confirmed that the prime minister - who had been due to visit @entity127 campaigning for local elections - will respond personally in the @entity9 this afternoon			1
@entity12 managed another blunder yesterday by showing details of a meeting he was about to enter , dealing with , among other topics , the bad press coverage over the lengthy queues to pass border controls at @entity136			1
mr @entity6 yesterday offered qualified support to his cabinet minister , who is facing calls to resign over his handling of the @entity59 deal			0
the premier insisted he did not currently believe the ministerial code had been broken - although he also hinted that an independent investigation could take place after mr @entity12 has given evidence to the @entity69			1
he also said mr @entity12 's special adviser @entity48 had been right to resign over ' too close , too frequent ' contacts with @entity68 lobbyist @entity149			1
this morning , @entity5 leader @entity63 sought to broaden the controversy by saying it ' goes to the character of the government '			1
unbowed : @entity12 shows no signs of feeling the mounting pressure for his resignation as he travels to a meeting ' people need to know , particularly in these times , that they have a government that stands up for them , not the rich and powerful , ' he told a question and answer event in central @entity163			1
' people need to know that there is the utmost probity and integrity in the way that @entity160 is run			0
' i am afraid the events of the last week suggest that something other than that has been going on			0
' mr @entity63 went on : ' it is a pattern with this prime minister , particularly around @entity174			1
he resists the calls for change			0
he resists the calls to do the right thing			0
' exactly as he did in phone hacking last summer , exactly as he did with @entity179 , exactly as he did with @entity180			0
' he is doing the same now when everyone can see that the obvious thing for him to do is make this referral to @entity96			2
' that is what he should get on and do rather than seeking to use @entity12 as a firewall			1
' @entity63 was aghast , appalled , his eyes two white billiard balls			2
‘ this , ’ he schpluttered , ‘ is a breach of paragraph 1.2 c of the code ! ’ my goodness			0
not paragraph 1.2 c. smelling salts , @entity195			0
someone put in a call to the @entity198 pronto and see if a firing squad for @entity12 can be arranged this very day			2
you ca n’t go breaking paragraph 1.2 c and still expect to belong to a government , matey , not in this day and age			0
call @entity204 ! pull in the @entity205 ! warp factor five ! commons speaker @entity2 mr @entity63 , champion @entity207 , had discerned an infraction ( alleged ) of the rules			1
his media allies were breathing so fast with the shock of it all , they practically needed a brown paper bag to increase the oxygen supply			0
gather , girls , gather			0
@entity30 pulled in their cheeks as though they were attached to the suction duct of a @entity220			0
speaker @entity2 , who had awarded possibly the lamest @entity221 ever granted in parliamentary history , frowned and cocked his ear			0
he could have been a great conductor at an oratorio rehearsal who is certain he has just identified a groaner in the back row of the tenor line			0
@entity230 1.2 c of the code			0
this was going to make the @entity234 affair look like a teddy bears ’ picnic			0
yesterday ’s comically melodramatic calling to the despatch box of @entity6 was , for its progenitors , a failure			0
they had hoped to show the prime minister as some sort of scuttling beetle , shifty , panicked , a collaborator with the @entity29 regime			0
they had intended him to emerge from the session wounded , bloodied , black smoke trailing from his starboard engine			0
@entity253 , the revolutionary @entity256 - @entity255 plot for world domination has been , er , postponed			0
as the @entity260 emperor said , things did not necessarily proceed to our advantage			0
the devil @entity6 , most regrettably , performed rather brilliantly			0
he did not just win the narrow encounters between himself and mr @entity63			2
by the end he had the @entity267 side roaring its support for him			0
speaker @entity2 , like @entity269 the dog , had been foiled ! the pm made pretty plain his contempt for the @entity274 ’s decision to haul him to the @entity9 ( he had had other things planned for the day )			2
he noted that he and @entity276 had answered questions about the matter only on wednesday			0
translation : why on earth this is worthy of @entity221 status , @entity279 only knows			0
or as @entity284 ( con , @entity285 ) was to put it : ‘ this is more nakedly opportunistic than you ’ll find on page three of @entity290 ’ the closest we got to @entity267 dissent was from @entity293 ( @entity294 ) , who craftily asked if we were getting ‘ value for money ’ from @entity125 ’s standards inspector			0
dr @entity293 put this with just enough drollery to keep mr @entity6 smiling			0
the prime minister was fired up , certainly , even a little tremulous of hand			0
there was a flash of anger when he told mr @entity63 , ‘ if you ’re going to make these accusations , get your facts right			2
’ he said he did ‘ not belittle ’ the @entity12 business but at the same time simply did not think it matched the importance of the economy , jobs , the euro ’s future and investment			2
it was ‘ bad judgement , rotten politics and plain wrong ’ of mr @entity63 to make such a bally - hoo about such recherche concerns			2
mr @entity63 , for his part , called for mr @entity6 to sack mr @entity12			1
it was that paragraph 1.2 c thing , see ? mr @entity63 thought that mr @entity6 was over-familiar with a small clique of powerful people			2
never ! urgent questions are sometimes held as a great weapon in the @entity327 ’s armoury but recent events suggest that they backfire when used in too political a way			2
the @entity267 benches united so strongly behind mr @entity6 that the pm was left looking stronger , while mr @entity63 was stranded in the position of an obsessive deriving frottage - style satisfaction at his @entity335 .			1

@entity332 *cancels* local election campaigning to respond to urgent commons question tabled by @entity5
*opposition* demand to know why @entity12 's actions have not been referred to independent adviser on ministerial conduct , sir @entity96
@entity63 accuses pm of using @entity12 as a ' firewall ' to protect himself and ' defending the indefensible '
