@entity13 was told that his post , which related to the @entity16 massacre , violated the social networking website ’s ‘ community standards ’ and was removed and had his profile deactivated – but @entity18 intervened			1
when asked by a user what he thought about the deletion of mr @entity13 ’s post , mr @entity18 said that a mistake may have been made , and alerted his company ’s vice president of @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity30 , to the matter			1
the founder of @entity1 stepped in to reverse the decision of his network to remove a post by a @entity6 actor , @entity13 ( right ) that compared ridiculing @entity8 to called a black person a n * * * * * or describing @entity11 as ‘ the messiah ’ when asked by a user what he thought about the deletion of mr @entity13 ’s post , mr @entity18 ( pictured ) said that a mistake may have been made he said : ‘ i do n’t think this should have been blocked			1
our team might have made a mistake			2
@entity30 , can you look into this ? ’ mr @entity13 , who is very vocal on political issues , posted a message last week in which he questioned the west ’s definition of freedom of expression in the aftermath of the @entity16 attack by two jihadists in @entity59			1
he wrote : ‘ a @entity62 @entity61 police officer dies doing his duty in the face of two mislead @entity61 youth killing falsely in the name of the religion of peace , @entity8			2
yes , even my blood boils when someone insults my @entity72 ... but that does not give individuals the right to kill			0
‘ but west needs to understand too that freedom of expression includes criticism , disagreement or even rejection of faiths or ideology ... but should not and must not allow ' insult '			2
would it be ' freedom of expression ' if i branded black people as n * * * * * * or if i say @entity11 was a messiah ? ’ he added : ‘ the @entity88 needs to rethink and fix its definition of “ freedom of expression ”			1
’ mr @entity13 , who is very vocal on political issues , posted the message last week - but it was removed mr @entity13 revealed that his account was subsequently blocked			1
he told @entity94 : ‘ i had been trying to log into my @entity1 for a couple of hours and it was n't accepting the password			0
i genuinely thought it had been hacked but then i got an email from @entity1 saying that my account had been temporarily blocked and my status had been deleted and this was the first of three warnings			2
that really made me angry so i took the screen grab and posted it as soon as i had access to my account			0
’ he added : ‘ i post so many controversial things on my @entity1 , i believe in voicing my opinion			0
it 's just funny that their selective freedom of speech caused them to delete only this particular post of all things			2
’ mr @entity30 later posted an apology and said he hoped mr @entity13 would re-post his comment			1
he wrote : ' as @entity18 mentioned , we made a mistake in taking this down			1
we try to do our best , but sometimes make mistakes			0
we apologize for this error , and hope that the author will re-post it as we are not able to restore it from our end			0
thanks for bringing it to our attention			0
' the spat follows @entity18 recounting a 2010 incident he had with a @entity6 extremist , who demanded that he be put to death for allowing insults about @entity8 to appear on @entity1			1
@entity18 wrote on @entity1 : ' a few years ago , an extremist in @entity6 fought to have me sentenced to death because @entity1 refused to ban content about @entity72 that offended him			0
' it was a result of the site 's promotion of an @entity141 which took place on may 20 of that year			0
and while he did not end up being charged with any crime or sentenced to death , the @entity6 government did block @entity1 in their country .			0
