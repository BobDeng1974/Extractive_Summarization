by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 28 march 2012 all cattle are descended from as few as 80 animals that were domesticated from wild ox in the @entity4 some 10,500 years ago , according to a new genetic study			2
an international team of scientists from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) in @entity10 and the @entity11 in @entity12 , were able to conduct the study by first extracting dna from the bones of domestic cattle excavated in @entity18 archaeological sites			1
these sites date to not long after the invention of farming and are in the region where cattle were first domesticated			1
moo - st interesting : the ancestors of these @entity26 cows have been traced to @entity18 the team examined how small differences in the dna sequences of those ancient cattle , as well as cattle living today , could have arisen given different population histories			1
using computer simulations they found that the @entity14 differences could only have arisen if a small number of animals , approximately 80 , were domesticated from wild ox , or aurochs			1
dr @entity40 of @entity9 , @entity10 , and the @entity11 , @entity12 and lead author of the study , said : ‘ getting reliable dna sequences from remains found in cold environments is routine			1
‘ that is why mammoths were one of the first extinct species to have their @entity14 read			2
but getting reliable dna from bones found in hot regions is much more difficult because temperature is so critical for dna survival			1
this meant we had to be extremely careful that we did not end up reading contaminating dna sequences from living , or only recently dead cattle			0
’ the number of animals domesticated has important implications for the archaeological study of domestication			1
professor @entity64 , a @entity8 geneticist and an author of the study , said : ‘ this is a surprisingly small number of cattle			0
we know from archaeological remains that the wild ancestors of modern - day cattle , known as aurochs , were common throughout @entity74 and @entity75 , so there would have been plenty of opportunities to capture and domesticate them			2
’ professor @entity79 , an author of the study based at the @entity11 , @entity12 , said : ‘ wild aurochs are very different beasts from modern domestic cattle			0
study : dna samples were taken from archaeological sites in @entity18 ‘ they were much bigger than modern cattle , and would n’t have had the domestic traits we see today , such as docility			1
' so capturing these animals in the first place would not have been easy , and even if some people did manage to snare them alive , their continued management and breeding would still have presented considerable challenges until they had been bred for smaller size and more docile behaviour			0
’ archaeological studies on the number and size of prehistoric animal bone have shown that not only cattle , but also goats , sheep and pigs were all first domesticated in the @entity4			2
but saying how many animals were domesticated for any of those species is a much harder question to answer			0
classical techniques in archaeology can not give us the whole picture , but genetics can help - especially if some of the genetic data comes from early domestic animals			0
dr @entity120 , a @entity9 bio-archaeologist and author on the study , said : ‘ in this study genetic analysis allowed us to answer questions that – until now – archaeologists would not even attempt to address			0
‘ a small number of cattle progenitors is consistent with the restricted area for which archaeologists have evidence for early cattle domestication 10,500 years ago			0
’ the study is published in the current issue of the journal @entity136 .			0

the samples were found in @entity18 archaeological sites
