by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 10:00 est , 21 september 2013 it is the latest mutt - have : a hug in a t - shirt			1
the snug - fitting @entity4 , which comes in three colours , is said to relax nervous dogs , in the same way that swaddling soothes fractious babies			1
as stress levels fall , the dogs find it easier to breathe and cope with their fears			2
@entity16 , a @entity27 terrier , is put in his @entity28 two or three times a week			0
his owner , @entity30 , of @entity31 , said : ‘ he panics if he hears people outside			0
‘ the t - shirt makes him calmer			1
his nerves do n’t completely go away but he is chilled and he looks adorable in it			0
’ another happy customer , @entity37 from @entity38 , said : ‘ i can not believe how incredibly effective the t - shirt was in calming my very anxious greyhound and how quickly she changed from a shaking , drooling wreck into a snoozing , relaxed dog			1
‘ it continued to work brilliantly during fireworks and thunderstorms			0
’ animal behaviour specialist @entity48 says the @entity4 can also be used to reassure dogs that are anxious about travelling in a car or nervous of other animals			1
@entity55 the @entity54 bulldog sports another variation of the t - shirt which is said to calm nervous dogs @entity16 , @entity59 and @entity55 pose in their @entity60 that come in different sizes , the smallest being for a @entity63 miss @entity48 believes the hug - like feel of the cotton over-rides the brain ’s primeval instinct of fight or flight in terms of trouble			1
those with two legs also benefit			0
she said : ‘ the owner feels he has something proactive to do to help their dog instead of them getting worked up by whatever is going on			0
' miss @entity48 , who assesses dogs for court cases and teaches staff at animal shelters including @entity83 , said that a normal t - shirt should also have a calming effect			1
however , the @entity4 is a better option as it is doggy - shaped and contains enough stretch to allow pets to move properly			2
she said : ‘ i am not a fan of dressing up dogs but i am a fan of t - shirts for dogs because they are so calming			2
’ dog coats and jackets are thought to be less beneficial because they do not completely close over the belly and so fail to make the creature feel like it is being enveloped in a hug			0
the @entity4 t - shirts start at £ 13 for a @entity63 or a small terrier			2
an @entity103 shirt , for a retriever or a large greyhound costs £ 19 .			0

the @entity4 comes in different sizes and colours to suit all dogs
the t - shirt is said to calm dogs nerves and help them breathe
