by @entity0 , political correspondent speaker @entity1 wants to increase the commercial potential of the @entity3 @entity1 is planning a worldwide search for a £ 200,000 - a-year commons chief executive to help to drive forward his controversial plans to commercialise the @entity7			1
the speaker is looking to break with centuries of history by appointing an entrepreneurial figure ‘ in the mould of businesswoman @entity15 or sir @entity16 ’ , with a shortlist of candidates drawn up after an extensive search			1
but mr @entity1 ’s critics claim the plan is part of the speaker ’s desire to create his own @entity23 - style powerbase in @entity24			1
the move follows last week ’s announcement that @entity27 , sir @entity28 – the most senior parliamentary official – is retiring after just two - and - a - half years in the post			0
sir @entity28 , who has worked in @entity24 for more than 42 years , had a tense relationship with mr @entity1 , marked by disagreements over the speaker ’s plans to increase @entity24 ’s income and bring more ‘ outsiders ’ into management			1
with the crumbling commons facing a repair bill estimated at more than £ 1 billion , mr @entity1 believes that more money needs to be found from commercial ventures , such as hiring out the facilities to film companies – so sir @entity28 ’s replacement should have a dazzling business cv			1
the @entity27 has traditionally been a constitutional expert promoted from within the ranks of @entity38 officials			2
the clerk ’s job , which comes with a £ 196,000 - a - year salary , is currently split into two roles , doubling as both the chief constitutional adviser to the speaker and the effective chief executive of the @entity38			1
under the new plan , the constitutional duties will be largely taken over by other officials			0
public advertisements for the position will be placed throughout the @entity61			0
sir @entity28 , @entity27 wanted to maintain the the traditions associated with the building sir @entity28 , 64 , is highly respected for the way he has managed to juggle mr @entity1 ’s desire to modernise @entity24 with the need to preserve @entity7 ’s traditions			2
he received a rare round of applause from mps after his retirement letter was read out by mr @entity1			2
it read : ‘ whatever the vicissitudes of parliamentary life and whatever brickbats may be thrown at it , i can truly say that the @entity3 now is a more effective scrutineer of the executive and more topical , relevant and independent - minded than i have ever known it			0
’ but relations between him and mr @entity1 had become increasingly strained as the speaker explored ways to boost @entity24 ’s revenues , described by critics as the ‘ @entity83 ’			1
mr @entity1 's plan has been dismissed by opponents as the ' @entity83 ' a source said : ‘ there was a running tension between @entity28 and @entity1 over the extent to which outsiders should be brought in to run the place			1
‘ it was not so much the principle – @entity28 is a good deal more open - minded than his predecessors and knows the @entity38 needs to be modernised – as the bombastic and temperamental manner of @entity98 ’s demands			2
it was all about creating his own fiefdom , a sort of @entity23			0
‘ he has made clear that the new boss has to be more of a @entity102 or a @entity16 than an @entity103			2
’ @entity105 mp @entity104 said last night : ‘ this does n’t surprise me at all			0
@entity107 [ its governing body ] has completely lost the plot			0
‘ opening up to every @entity110 does not work			0
it is a security risk and prevents us from serving our constituents in the efficient way they deserve			0
’ a spokesman for the speaker said : ‘ the search has begun to recruit a new clerk , which will include candidates drawn from abroad			1
‘ the successful candidate will need to combine business experience with constitutional expertise			0

speaker @entity1 has been keen to increase the commercial potential of the @entity38
critics *accuse* him of pushing through the ' @entity83 '
search for new @entity130 will include candidates from abroad
speaker wants high - *profile* figure such as @entity16 or @entity15
