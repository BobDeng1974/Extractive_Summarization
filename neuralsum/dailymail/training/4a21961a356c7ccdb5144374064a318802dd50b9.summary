by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 09:19 est , 7 september 2012 @entity2 today released a stunning video showing a 500,000 mile long ' solar whip ' on the surface of the sun - and the beautiful aurora it created on earth			1
captured by from @entity2 ’s @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , the video shows in unprecedented detail a very long , whip - like solar filament extending over half a million miles in a long arc above the sun ’s surface			1
click for video the coronal mass ejection , or @entity19 , traveled at over 900 miles per second			0
the @entity19 did not travel directly toward @entity20 , but did connect with @entity20 's magnetic environment , or magnetosphere , with a glancing blow , causing aurora to appear on monday evening			1
a ' solar whip ' or filament is caused when a red glowing loop of plasma erupts , releasing the plasma out in huge loops hundreds of thousands of miles into space			2
the filaments are anchored to the @entity33 's surface in the photosphere , and extend outwards into the @entity33 's hot outer atmosphere , called the corona			2
the ' whip ' was a filament , cooler clouds of solar material that are tethered above the sun ’s surface by unstable magnetic forces			2
the images and video ( below ) , which covers august 6 to 8 , 2012 show the filament as a darker strand that has been in view for several days			2
it the snaps , sending radiation hurtling towards earth			1
at the time , @entity2 revealed a video of the activity			1
' towards the end of the video part of the filament seems to break away , but its basic length and shape seem to have remained mostly intact , ' says @entity2			1
the video , which condenses three hours of activity , also reveals the action in dramatic detail in extreme ultraviolet light			0
the @entity67 spaceweather prediction center warned that a cloud of radiation from the eruption would reach @entity20 today			2
the radiation cloud will create a minor to moderate geomagnetic storm , bringing the northern lights to parts of @entity77 , it said			0
to prove the point , @entity2 today revealed the image below , showing the aurora in breathtaking beauty			1
swirls of green and red appear in an aurora over @entity85 , @entity86 on the night of september 3 , 2012 following a massive eruption on the solar surface @entity2 says the image is a classic example of a solar prominence ( also known as a filament when viewed against the solar disk )			1
this is a large , bright feature extending outward from the @entity33 's surface			0
prominences are anchored to the @entity33 's surface in the photosphere , and extend outwards into the @entity33 's hot outer atmosphere , called the corona			0
a prominence forms over timescales of about a day , and stable prominences may persist in the corona for several months , looping hundreds of thousands of miles into space			0
however , scientists are still researching how and why prominences are formed			0
the red - glowing looped material is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium			0
the prominence plasma flows along a tangled and twisted structure of magnetic fields generated by the sun ’s internal dynamo			0
an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward , releasing the plasma			0
the huge coronal mass ejection erupting on the @entity33 ( this picture : an overlay blended version of the 304 and 171 angstrom wavelengths ) on august 31 , 2012 a long filament of solar material that had been hovering in the sun 's atmosphere , the corona , erupted out into space at 4:36 p.m. edt			1
the coronal mass ejection , or @entity19 , traveled at over 900 miles per second			0
an image created by blending two different wavelengths of the magnificent coronal mass ejection on the @entity33 on 31 aug 2012 this incredible image from @entity2 's @entity13 ( @entity13 ) shows a very long , whip - like solar filament in the centre of the image , extending over half a million miles in a long arc above the sun 's surface the video also reveals what the filament looks like closer to the surface of the sun this image of a previous solar filament of the sun 's surface shows the scale of eruptions .			1
