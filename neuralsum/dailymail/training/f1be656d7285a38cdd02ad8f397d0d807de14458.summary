by @entity0 the taxman was left humiliated last night after being exposed for getting his sums wrong on how much tax was collected			2
in a damning report , the @entity5 said @entity7 had miscalculated its figures by £ 1.9billion a year since the coalition government came to power			1
@entity11 , the @entity13 mp and chairman of the @entity15 , said it was a ‘ serious error ’ which painted a ‘ worrying picture ’ of @entity7 ’s ability to do its job			1
@entity7 had miscalculated its figures by £ 1.9billion a year since the coalition government came to power , it has been revealed she said : ‘ if @entity7 ca n’t get its own numbers right , how can it ask the same of others ? ‘ it is truly depressing that @entity7 ’s failure to take appropriate action has led to its unwittingly misleading ministers , parliament and the taxpayer			1
’ @entity31 , the department ’s embattled chief executive , will be grilled by mps on the @entity34 next tuesday to explain the latest disaster			1
a week later , she faces a second inquisition from @entity33 on the @entity15 , a sign of the mp ’s concerns about the latest cock - up by the department			0
the embarrassing mistake comes as @entity7 is demanding new powers to be able to raid people ’s bank accounts			2
it wants to be able to take money directly from people ’s current accounts , joint accounts or even tax - free isas in order to settle unpaid tax bills			0
@entity11 , the @entity13 mp and chairman of the @entity15 , said it was a ‘ serious error ’ around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers in a move which has triggered outrage among many accountants			1
in november 2010 , @entity7 set itself a target for how much tax it would collect each year			1
for the next few years , it boasted that it had beaten this target			0
in fact , it had just got its ‘ baseline ’ calculation , used to work out whether it had beaten or missed its target , wrong by around £ 1.9billion a year			1
the @entity5 ’s report , published yesterday , said : ‘ this made the original targets easier to achieve			0
’ in 2011/12 and 2012/13 , @entity7 claimed to have beaten its targets by £ 1.9billion and £ 2billion respectively			2
in reality , it had not			0
the report warns : ‘ it is now clear that this apparent over-performance was actually attributable to the baseline error			0
‘ so @entity7 in fact achieved almost exactly the level of performance improvement that was required			0
’ mrs @entity11 said : ‘ the fact @entity7 did not know about this serious error in its calculations until the @entity5 pointed it out paints a worrying picture			1
’ @entity81 , director of the @entity82 , the campaign group , said : ‘ it is not surprising people do n’t trust the tax system when @entity7 is making such basic errors			1
‘ it ’s ludicrous that there could be billion - pound errors in the public finances and it raises fears that the deficit might be even bigger than we think it is			0
‘ such mistakes show what folly it would be to allow @entity7 direct access to people ’s bank accounts , as the coalition government is proposing			2
’ recently , @entity7 estimated around 3.5million customers paid too much tax in 2013/14 and around two million customers paid too little tax			2
@entity105 , general secretary of the @entity106 , which represents many @entity7 workers , said : ‘ it is stunning that the department charged with administering the taxes that fund all our other essential public services ca n’t seem to get its sums right			0
‘ it is also deeply worrying that , at a time when it is cutting thousands more staff , @entity7 is over-egging its level of performance			0
’ overall , @entity7 collected £ 506billion in tax in 2013/14 , which was £ 30billion more than it had collected during the previous tax year			1
an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ we regret an historic error made in 2011 when we wrongly calculated the baseline against which our performance was measured			1
‘ we have corrected this error and even against the corrected baseline we have still exceeded our targets			0
we will work closely with the @entity5 to prevent this happening again			0

@entity13 mp @entity11 said @entity7 made a ‘ serious error ’
@entity133 ’s chief executive , @entity31 , will be grilled by mps
