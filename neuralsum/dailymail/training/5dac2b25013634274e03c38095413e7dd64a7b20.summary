by @entity0 for @entity1 the date of @entity4 's potential destruction has been set at 16 march 2880 , when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet			1
researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly that it should break apart , but somehow remains intact on its @entity4 - bound trajectory			1
they believe it is held together by cohesive forces known as @entity17 - and although this is considered a major breakthrough , scientists still do n't know how to stop it			1
scroll down for animation the date of @entity4 's potential destruction has been set at 16 march 2880 , when an asteroid hurtling through space has a possibility of striking our planet			1
researchers studying the rock found that its body rotates so quickly , it should break apart , but somehow remains intact on its @entity4 - bound trajectory the discovery was made by researchers at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33			1
previous research has shown that asteroids are loose piles of rubble held together by gravity and friction			0
the asteroid , named 1950 @entity41 , is a rock two - thirds of a mile in diameter , travelling at about 15 km ( nine miles ) per second relative to the @entity4			1
it is approximately 3,280ft ( 1,000 metres ) in diameter , but rotates once every two hours and six minutes			0
at this rate , the rock should break apart and eventually disintegrate , but it is not showing any signs of doing so			0
in fact , the rotation is so fast that at its equator , 1950 da effectively experiences negative gravity			1
if an astronaut were to attempt to stand on this surface , he or she would fly off into space unless he or she were somehow anchored			0
the presence of cohesive forces has been predicted in small asteroids , but definitive evidence has never been seen before			0
it is due to swing so close to @entity4 it could slam into the @entity65 at 38,000 miles per hour			2
it is estimated that if 1950 @entity41 were to collide with the planet , it would do so with an force of around 44,800 megatonnes of @entity70			1
although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent , this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids			1
however , the @entity32 team found that the asteroid , called 1950 @entity41 , is spinning so quickly that it defies these forces			1
it is approximately 3,280ft ( 1,000 metres ) in diameter , but rotates once every two hours and six minutes			0
at this rate , the rock should break apart and eventually disintegrate , but it is not showing any signs of doing so			0
@entity85 , a postdoctoral researcher ; @entity86 , a doctoral candidate ; and @entity88 , an assistant professor in the @entity89 and @entity90 , wanted to know what keeps the body from breaking apart			0
by calculating 1950 @entity41 â€™s temperature and density , the team detected the cohesive forces that stop it breaking up			1
' we found that 1950 @entity41 is rotating faster than the breakup limit for its density , ' said @entity85			1
' so if just gravity were holding this rubble pile together , as is generally assumed , it would fly apart			0
therefore , interparticle cohesive forces must be holding it together			0
' in fact , the rotation is so fast that at its equator , 1950 da effectively experiences negative gravity			1
if an astronaut were to attempt to stand on this surface , they would would be flung off into space			0
the presence of cohesive forces has been predicted in small asteroids , but definitive evidence has never been seen before			0
the findings , published in this week 's edition of the science journal nature , have potential implications for defending our planet from a massive asteroid impact			2
' following the february 2013 asteroid impact in @entity126 , @entity127 , there is renewed interest in figuring out how to deal with the potential hazard of an asteroid impact , ' said professor @entity85			2
animation : asteroid 1950 @entity41 's potential trajectory a simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the @entity136 , @entity136 , shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the @entity65 ' understanding what holds these asteroids together can inform strategies to guard against future impacts			1
' this research reveals some techniques , such sending a massive object on a collision course with the asteroid , could worsen the effects			0
the asteroid ( pictured ) , is due to swing so close to @entity4 it could slam into the @entity65 at 38,000 miles per hour for example , this technique could get in the way of forces keeping the asteroid together , causing it to break apart into lots of smaller , threatening asteroids that could be on a collision course for @entity4			1
this may be what occurred with the asteroid @entity161 , which was caught by the @entity162 in 2013 and 2014 coming undone , possibly due to a collision with a meteor			2
' with such tenuous cohesive forces holding one of these asteroids together , a very small impulse may result in a complete disruption , ' said professor @entity85			0
the asteroid is travelling at about 9 miles ( 15km ) a second relative to the @entity4			2
it is due to swing so close to @entity4 it could slam into the @entity65 at 38,000 miles per hour			2
it is estimated that if 1950 @entity41 were to collide with the planet , it would do so with a force of around 44,800 megatonnes of @entity70			1
although the probability of an impact is only 0.3 per cent , this represents a risk 50 per cent greater than an impact from all other asteroids			1
over the long timescales of @entity4 's history , asteroids this size and larger have periodically hammered the planet			2
the so - called @entity188 , for instance , ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			0
asteroid 1950 da was discovered on 23 february 1950			1
it was observed for 17 days and then faded from view for half a century			0
then , an object discovered on 31 december 2000 was recognised as being the long - lost 1950 da			1
@entity197 sighting was exactly 200 years to the night after the discovery of the first asteroid , @entity200			2
it was found that the asteroid 1950 @entity41 has a trajectory that for a 20 - minute window on march 16 , 2880 , a collision can not be entirely ruled out			1
this graphic shows the orbits of all the known @entity208 ( @entity209 ) , numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013			0
these are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large ( at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size ) , and because they follow orbits that pass close to the @entity4 's orbit @entity17 forces are the attractive forces that hold molecules close together and are fundamental for chemistry , biology and physics			1
they arise due to attraction between oppositely charged areas of substances			0
the strength of @entity17 ' forces is related to the size of atoms and @entity229 the bigger the atom or molecule the bigger the @entity17 ' force			1
however , they are among the weakest known chemical interactions , so they are notoriously hard to study			0
but scientists claim there is no cause for concern			2
if it is eventually decided 1950 @entity41 needs to be diverted , the hundreds of years of warning could allow a method as simple as dusting the surface of the asteroid with chalk or charcoal , or perhaps white glass beads			1
this would change the asteroid 's reflectivity and allow sunlight to do the work of pushing the asteroid out of the way			2
@entity254 is currently tracking all 1,400 potentially hazardous asteroids so far identified and predicting their future close approaches and impact probabilities			0
as part of this effort it is working on the development of an infrared sensor that could improve its asteroid tracking capabilities , dubbed the @entity265 ( @entity265 ) sensor			0
once launched , the space - based telescope would be positioned at a location about four times the distance between @entity4 and the moon			2
from this lofty perch , @entity265 could observe the comings and goings of near @entity4 objects , including @entity209 , without the impediments such as cloud cover and daylight			0
the @entity265 ( @entity265 ) is a mission proposed to @entity254 to find potentially hazardous asteroids			0
the mission will use a new sensor , called the @entity265 chip , that has more pixels and better sensitivity than previous generations of infrared sensors			0

asteroid 1950 da has a 0.3 per cent chance of hitting @entity4 in *867* years
a possible impact date for 1950 @entity41 is on 16 march , 2880 , scientists say
if it hits , it would do so with a force of 44,800 megatonnes of @entity70
but scientists say there is no cause for concern as the risk is low
asteroid 's body defies gravity due to forces known as @entity17
these forces have never been spotted on an asteroid before
scientists say they are now closer to finding out how to stop the rock
