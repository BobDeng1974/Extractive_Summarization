by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 governor @entity1 speaks with the chief secretary to the treasury , @entity5 , during last year 's event for the @entity2 ’s annual summer party , governor @entity1 was convinced the event needed to be a little bit more inclusive			1
but for many staff the @entity3 ’s decision to tamper with tradition just was n’t , well , cricket			2
the @entity2 ’s first foreign chief has lined up a rounders match to replace cricket because he believes the age - old summer game to be too exclusive			1
other activities at the event in @entity20 , @entity21 , tomorrow include five - a - side football , tennis , a three - legged race , an egg - and - spoon race , tug - of - war and welly throwing			1
mr @entity1 stopped short of introducing ice - hockey , the sport he played when he was at @entity29 in the 1980s and @entity30 in the 1990s			2
the decision to ditch cricket is likely to raise eyebrows among staff past and present including former governor and keen cricketer @entity37 , who took part in the match up to his retirement last summer			1
@entity41 , a veteran @entity42 commentator who has played at the @entity2 ’s ground , said the decision to scrap cricket was outrageous			1
he said : ‘ it is sacrilege			0
it is one of the most wonderful grounds you could ever wish to play on and for the game to be denied because of exclusivity is awful			0
cricket is one of our national games			2
’ the event usually pits 11 members of staff against a governor ’s team			0
former @entity61 captain @entity60 played in last year ’s match , as did chief secretary to the treasury @entity5			0

the decision to ditch cricket is likely to raise eyebrows among staff past and present including former governor and keen cricketer @entity37 , who took part in the match up to his retirement last summer ( above ) but mr @entity1 is understood to have regarded a match involving 22 men as too exclusive and wanted to include more women			1
he is a keen sportsman and was an ice hockey goalkeeper in his youth			0
he is a fan of @entity87 side @entity86 , and will no doubt be keeping an eye on @entity89 today where fellow @entity3 @entity90 is bidding to win @entity67			0
the @entity2 denied mr @entity1 ‘ banned ’ cricket and insisted that staff were asked what events they would like to take place			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the arrangements for the day were in the hands of staff			0
