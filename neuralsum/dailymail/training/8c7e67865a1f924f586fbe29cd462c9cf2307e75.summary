@entity1 's closest aides prepared him for the prime minister 's job by hurling abuse like ' sod off you @entity7 ' at him , it was revealed today			1
his former special adviser @entity9 said he and other colleagues would scream insults to ' get under the skin ' of the former @entity14 leader , who would shout back the mantra ' i will do my utmost '			1
mr @entity1 took the abuse in his office as he readied himself to replace @entity20 on june 27 , 2007			2
partnership : @entity9 , front left , screamed at @entity1 , right , to help him prepare for the top job in a blog posted today , exactly five years after mr @entity1 entered @entity24 , mr @entity9 wrote that these heckles were designed to reproduce what he would face in the top job			1
protesters were hanging outside @entity24 calling mr @entity20 a war criminal as he left office , he said , so mr @entity1 also needed to be prepared for receiving the most upsetting remarks			2
' it ’s not often you ’re paid to hurl abuse at someone who ’s about to become the most powerful man in the country , but that ’s how the day started , ' he said			2
' given @entity41 war protestors were already gathering at the @entity24 gates to see off @entity20 , we suggested he do a few run - throughs with us heckling him so he could get used to the distraction he ’d experience later			0
historic : this is the moment @entity20 handed over power to @entity1 in the hall of @entity24 in 2007 ' i did always wonder what any @entity51 officials passing outside the room would have thought hearing @entity1 booming out : " i will do my utmost " while i shouted back at him : " sod off , you @entity58 git ! " ' @entity61 ( @entity62 , fellow adviser ) heckles were from the @entity64 school ( " booo ! " , " @entity65 ! " , " you ’re a very bad man ! " , etc. ) , but i tried to get in the spirit a bit more : ' blood on your hands , @entity1 ! ' , you ’re a murderer , @entity1 ! ' ' every so often , i ’d shout something that would get under his skin , and he ’d stop his speech and just give me a long , deathly stare			1
i ’d protest : “ well you ca n’t do that if someone says it in the street ” , which got me another stare , ' he wrote			0
the blog gives a fascinating insight into what happened on that historic day			0
but @entity84 adviser mr @entity9 was later forced to resign after a series of emails he sent from @entity24 to fellow @entity14 spin doctor @entity87			1
battle : mr @entity9 's blog also reveals that mr @entity1 wanted to scrap tuition fees but feared reprisals from @entity20 's supporters in the emails , mr @entity9 , one of the prime minister ’s most loyal and trusted advisers , reportedly made ‘ vile ’ and false allegations against mr @entity97 and mr @entity98 concerning their private lives			1
mr @entity9 's piece also details how hard mr @entity1 tried to get @entity20 's staff to work for him , which mr @entity9 described as ' humiliating '			1
it also revealed that he would have scrapped tuition fees but feared a backlash from @entity20 's supporters			0
' if he ’d succeeded , ' @entity107 said , ' it would have strengthened his hand to make major departures from @entity20 policies in his early days			0
' proposals such as scrapping tuition fees which had been high on the list of planned announcements were shelved because @entity1 did n’t feel secure enough against a @entity117 backlash			0
' and his fate was sealed because he did not take across enough staff from his chancellor 's office in the @entity51 , he said			0
' in no. 10 , he inherited equally - brilliant , equally - expert civil servants , but – because there was not the same level of trust and confidence on his side , and the same knowledge of how best to work with him on theirs – the micro-manager within @entity1 re-surfaced , ' he said .			0

special adviser @entity9 has admitted he screamed insults at mr @entity133 to ' get under his skin '
@entity1 would reply ' i will do my utmost ' at the top of his voice
' blood on your hands , @entity1 ! ' , ' you ’re a murderer ! ' ' you *'re* a very bad man ! ' were other insults thrown
