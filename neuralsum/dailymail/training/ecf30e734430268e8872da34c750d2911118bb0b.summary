a teenager has become one of the fastest @entity3 men of all time just seven months after taking up professional running and he thinks he could run even faster at this year 's @entity5 - where he faces the prospect of lining up against reigning champion and world record holder @entity9			1
college student @entity10 smashed the 100 metres @entity12 record as he won gold in @entity14 last night after just a few months of serious training			1
his time of 10.05sec makes him the fastest @entity3 junior of all time - even beating @entity21 ' @entity3 junior record of 10.06sec in 1997 and the previous championship record set by @entity24 @entity23 in 2002			1
before that the teenager 's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track			2
the former @entity46 pupil - who is of @entity48 and @entity49 descent - was signed up by @entity50 when he was just eight years old and spent seven years with the @entity52 champions before switching to his local club @entity53 and @entity54			2
he spent part of last season on loan at nearby @entity59 side @entity58 , but was still training with @entity53 and @entity54 until the end of the year			1
@entity10 said last year that football would always come first but now he is less sure			1
his remarkable win makes him one to watch at the @entity5 in two weeks time where he will compete in the 100 metres and the 4x100 metres relay			2
talent : @entity10 only quit football in november last year to focus on running and he thinks he can run faster at the @entity5 posting on @entity67 this morning , mr @entity10 said : ' literally the happiest guy in the world right now			1
months of hard work have paid off and i 'm now @entity72 ! ' speaking about his surprise win yesterday , he said : ' this is a massive stepping stone			2
it will help me a lot			2
i never thought i 'd be a junior world champion			0
a world junior final in @entity14 , who 's not going to be nervous ? you 've got to try to use the nerves in a good way , try to put them towards my run - and i did			0
' i was trying to stay relaxed			0
i know if i tighten up i do n't run as quickly so i was trying to stay relaxed and focused and enjoy the race '			0
the 18 - year - old was 0.12secs quicker than @entity85 from the @entity86 while @entity88 's @entity87 came third in a time of 10.28			0
he also beat his previous best of 10.08 , which he clocked in a low - key race in @entity92 last month			0
the phenomenal run took place in the same @entity95 where @entity96 became the oldest man and last @entity98 to win 100m gold at the @entity100 aged 32			1
@entity101 is the only @entity52 athlete to beat his @entity31 's time this year , with the @entity103 running 10.04secs in @entity105 in may			0
@entity10 hopes he can continue to improve and hinted he could run even faster in @entity28			1
when asked if he thinks he can clock a sub- 10sec time , he added : ' i honestly do not know			0
i am feeling good and i am running well , i just feel there is a whole lot more to come			0
' the 10 - second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race			0
the current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by @entity88 's @entity9 while @entity86 @entity117 holds the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds			1
easy : @entity10 cruised to victory in both the semi-final and final becoming one of the fastest ever @entity98 @entity123 : the youngster beat his previous best of 10.08 , which he clocked in a low - key race in @entity92 last month no sweat : @entity10 only quit football in january to start running training professionally video : watch an interview with @entity10 after finding out he is going to the @entity5 ...			1
