a 28 - year - old woman from @entity1 is set to become the first female to be given a try out for the @entity4			1
@entity5 had never kicked anything more than a soccer ball in an organised game before she started practicing long - range field goals			1
now she has been given a chance at an @entity4 regional scouting combine on sunday at the @entity13 ' training facility in @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity37 's achievement sparked predictions she could become the first woman to win the ' @entity34 ' in @entity40 , but she eventually finished eighth			2
speaking about her chances of getting the @entity4 call , @entity5 said : ' i am working hard to prepare but i am also realistic about my chances			1
' i hope my willingness to put myself out there inspires others to seize opportunities and challenges			2
the support from around the world has been so heartening			2
' her goal for the weekend is to kick perfect 60 - yard field goals			1
however , the odds are against her - scouts are likely to want to see her connect on extra points and chip - shot field goals with some consistency before moving on to the heavy kicking			1
@entity5 wrote her master 's thesis on how college and pro athletes can use video games to improve their athletic performance @entity5 ( pictured with a friend ) had never kicked anything more than a soccer ball in an organised game and she just started practicing long - range field goals the 30 - year - old @entity5 , from @entity1 , taking aim for a kick at an indoor session @entity31 waves to fans as she walks down pit road before the start of the @entity32 @entity34 @entity5 will compete against more accomplished or polished college kickers , all hoping to prove they have the leg strength and accuracy worthy of earning an invite to an @entity4 training camp			1
@entity88 kicker @entity87 participated in a regional combine last year before he was drafted and morphed into ' @entity87 '			1
@entity90 special teams coach @entity89 said teams look for several things specifically when judging kickers in these situations			2
the most important is leg strength , followed by accuracy on field goals over 40 yards , and how they did on clutch kicks in college			0
@entity37 won the pole at the @entity34 , becoming the first woman to secure the top spot for any @entity105 race ' when rating field goals , the deepest we test at the combine is a 50 - yard field goal			1
there 's not many attempts over 55 yards			0
' we do n't practice kicks much deeper than that - rarely do we do them , ' @entity89 said			1
' you can tell after watching a 50 - yard field goal how far the ball goes over the crossbar if they can hit from 55			2
' they 've got to be able to hit from 55			0
on kickoffs , they 've got to be able to get the ball out of the back of the end zone			0
' the regional combines debuted in 2011 , and feature players who were n't among the 333 invited to the main combine in @entity127			1
the league is holding these sessions in 10 cities this offseason , with the most impressive players advancing to a super-regional in april in @entity134			0
it 's sort of the sports version of a tv reality show , where each hit and tackle can wow a scout and move a player on to the next round			0
only instead of a recording contract , it 's an @entity4 one			1
' it 's all up to those guys			0
if you 're talented enough , you 're going to get recognised			0
and if you put up good numbers , the numbers do n't lie , ' said @entity149 , assistant general manager / director of player personnel for the @entity152			0
' that 's one of the things about the combine part of this business			2
it 's the least subjective part of the business			0
and it 's really objective , because you 're looking at numbers			0
' @entity162 , a partner with @entity163 in @entity15 , said : ' the real upside is if she reaches the next level			0
' @entity167 , in general , are n't brands			0
even someone like @entity170 , who ( has won ) @entity171 , would have to do a little more than kick to capitalise and endorse at the national level			2
' the one thing she has that they do n't have is that she 's a woman			0
the uniqueness of her and the possible success she has will differentiate what she has at that position			2
' while a female has never played in the @entity4 , if the gender breakthrough did happen , it most likely would be at kicker			1
as a grad student at @entity186 , @entity5 wrote her master 's thesis on how college and pro athletes can use video games to improve their athletic performance			1
she built upon the results of the study to start her own consulting firm , @entity196 media			0

@entity5 , 28 , will kick at an @entity4 regional scouting combine
it follows success of @entity19 - born @entity32 driver @entity31
