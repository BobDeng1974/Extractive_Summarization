by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 19 december 2012 an elderly man who systematically abused two girls over the last 43 years and made one of them pregnant has walked free from @entity4 because of his mental condition			1
a judge ruled that @entity7 , 72 , who suffers from dementia , was mentally incapable of standing criminal trial because he would not be able to understand the proceedings , instruct lawyers or give evidence			1
@entity7 had previously been found by a jury to have committed a catalogue of offences of rape , sexual assault , and indecency against children			1
no other option : judge @entity21 said he had no alternative but to discharge @entity7 , despite his guilt yesterday the pensioner from @entity25 , @entity26 , walked free from @entity4 after judge @entity21 said he had no option but to discharge him			1
@entity7 was accused of raping a girl under 16 between 1971 and 1976 , two charges of indecency with a child between 1969 - 1971 , and two charges of indecent assault on the same person , then an adult , between 1997 and 2011			1
he was also accused of attempting to rape a 10 - year - old girl between 1989 - 1990 , indecency against the same child between 1990 - 1995 , and indecently assaulting her three times between 1987 - 1995			0
in june , a judge acting on the advice of psychiatrists and psychologists decided @entity7 was mentally unfit to plead or stand trial , before jurors found that he did ' do the acts alleged ' after a five - day trial held under the @entity48 in july			1
the case was then adjourned for further psychiatric reports , before @entity7 appeared at @entity4 to hear his fate yesterday			2
prosecutor @entity52 said that under the @entity48 , there were only three possible options : a hospital order , a supervision order , or a discharge			0
' this is not a happy situation ' , he said			0
@entity4 @entity4 : @entity7 walked free from the court yesterday @entity61 , for @entity7 , said the probation service had declined to prepare a report as they were unable to manage someone with his disability , leaving the court with only the discharge option			2
judge @entity21 told @entity7 : ' you will know that the jury found that you had carried out the alleged acts			2
that , i hope , is of some comfort to the complainants who gave evidence			0
' he said there were a limited number of sentencing options and @entity7 's condition meant he did not qualify for a hospital order under the @entity48			1
supervision by the probation service or social services would be of no benefit to @entity7 or the public , so the judge said he had no other option but to discharge him			2
this , he said , did not detract from the gravity of what @entity7 had done			2
the judge imposed a @entity93 that barred @entity7 from any unsupervised contact with children under 16 and from any contact with the complainants			2
he also ordered him to sign the @entity98 register for five years			0
the systematic abuse came to light last year when one of the women involved told police she had been sexually abused by @entity7 from the age of nine to 16			1
she told officers he made her carry out sex acts before he began raping her at the age of 11			0
it was alleged in the trial this summer that this had happened up to four times a week , and that when the girl was 13 , she became pregnant			0
she had the baby when she was 14 , she and the child were taken into care and the baby was later adopted			0
@entity7 denied to police that he had ever had sex with the woman when she was a child , but dna tests proved that he was the father			0
in later life , the girl had occasionally to go @entity7 's home and , on two such visits , he made sexual advances to her			1
the jury was told that offences against the second girl followed a similar pattern , but although @entity7 abused her , he did not rape her			0
after the jury had returned verdicts that on all 19 charges @entity7 did the alleged acts , the judge said it was clear how badly affected the victims had been by their experiences			1
he said that if @entity7 had been fit for trial and had been convicted he would have received a sentence of about 15 years			1
@entity140 , associate head of policy at the @entity142 , said : ' it â€™s desperately unfortunate that the appalling damage caused by this man can not be properly reflected in a prison sentence			0
' the victims suffered horrendous sexual abuse over a number of years and will no doubt need counselling and support to help get their lives back on track			1
' the only crumb of comfort they can take from this dreadful case is that their stories have been believed			0

@entity7 's systematic abuse lasted 43 years and left one of his victims pregnant
