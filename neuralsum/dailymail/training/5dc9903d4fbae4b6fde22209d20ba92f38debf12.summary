ancient artefacts thought to be early gaming pieces will have to be reclassified after new research which claims they were actually used to wipe bottoms			2
the flat , disc - shaped @entity6 relics have been in the collection at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , since the @entity11			1
up until now museum experts thought the items were used for early games like draughts , but an article in the @entity17 has now proposed that they have a very different function			1
' now they are suddenly engaging items ' : dr @entity20 , curator of the @entity8 reserve collection , said he thinks the new ' hilarious ' explanation of the disks will help people better relate to them how far we 've come : these are the ancient @entity6 artefacts thought to be gaming chips that experts now believe were an early equivalent to toilet paper it is well publicised that @entity33 used sponges mounted on sticks and dipped in vinegar as an alternative to toilet paper			1
yet the idea these ceramic discs might also have been used for such personal hygiene is a revelation			1
the broken pieces - known as ' pessoi ' , meaning pebbles - range in size from 1in to 4in in diameter and were excavated near to the museum in 1960			1
it had been thought that they were chips used to play an ancient game , also known as ' pessoi ' , but research published last month in the @entity17 drew from classical sources to present evidence that they were also used to clean up after going to the toilet			1
noting the ancient @entity58 proverb ' three stones are enough to wipe one 's a * * * ' , @entity60 , assistant professor in forensic medicine at the @entity62 in @entity63 , points to archaeological excavations which have uncovered pessoi inside the pits of @entity58 and @entity6 latrines across the @entity67			2
in one such dig in @entity71 , @entity69 archaeologists found a range of such pessoi 1.2 - 4in in diameter and 0.2 - 0.8in thick which , professor @entity60 wrote , were 're - cut from old broken ceramics to give smooth angles that would minimise anal trauma '			1
@entity6 householders revelled in having graffiti on their walls , especially if an election was coming up , researchers believe			2
hundreds of political slogans have been found in @entity84 and the walls of the wealthiest voters offered prime advertising space for candidates			2
it would have been the @entity6 equivalent of posting a @entity92 message , hiring an advertising hoarding or sticking a campaign poster in a front window			2
the discovery of slogans on the walls of the homes of @entity84 's riches inhabitants would have meant that homeowners gave their active approval to whoever scrawled the messages , archaeologist @entity96 said			0
‘ the facades of the private houses and even the streetwalks in front of them were controlled and maintained by the owner of the house , and in that respect , the idea that the wall space could be appropriated by anyone who wanted to do it seems unlikely , ’ she told @entity106			0
other evidence from the classical world has been passed down to us in the form of ceramics painted with representations of figures using pessoi to clean their buttocks			0
according to professor @entity60 's article , the @entity58 and @entity33 even inscribed some of their pessoi with the names of their enemies or others they did n't like			1
thus everytime they went to the toilet they would literally be wiping their faecal matter on the names of hated individuals			0
examples of such stones have been found by archaeologists bearing the names of such noted historical figures as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , professor @entity60 reported			0
museum curator dr @entity147 said : ' when pottery like this is excavated it is someone 's job to wash it clean			1
' so , some poor and unsuspecting archaeologist has probably had the delight of scrubbing some @entity6 waste off of these pieces			0
' it is not beyond the realms of possibility that we could still find some further signs of waste or residue			0
' however , these pottery pieces have no monetary value because we are essentially talking about items once used as toilet roll			0
' the pieces had always been catalogued as as broken gaming pieces but i was never particularly happy with that explanation			0
' but when the article produced the theory they were used to wipe people 's bums i thought it was hilarious and it just appealed to me			1
' i love the idea we 've had these in the museum for 50 years being largely ignored and now they are suddenly engaging items you can relate to			2
' ancient : an article in the @entity17 by a noted @entity186 pathologist said that examples of the stones - known as ' pessoi ' - had been unearthed in excavations of latrines across the classical world uncomfortable : study author @entity60 suggests the abrasive texture of the pessoi could have led to skin irritation , mucosal damage , or complications of external haemorrhoids dr @entity60 's research indicates that the use of such stones would have probably been rather hard on the rear ends of the ancients , and could have caused a variety of medical issues			1
he suggests the abrasive texture of the pessoi could have led to skin irritation , mucosal damage , or complications of external haemorrhoids			0
he wrote : ' maybe this crude and satiric description by @entity210 in his 8th epode ( 1st century @entity212 ) — “ an a * * * at the centre of dry and old buttocks mimicking that of a defecating cow ” — refers to complications arising from such anal irritation			0
' ' in the @entity6 era it was that or very little else ' : dr @entity20 said the museum will now reclassify the relics dr @entity20 , who has been at the @entity8 museum for seven years , added : ' we will obviously have to think about re-classifying these objects on our catalogue			1
' but we hope the pieces will make people smile when they learn what they were used for			0
' they would have probably been quite scratchy to use and i doubt they would be as comfortable as using toilet roll			2
' but in the @entity6 era it was that or very little else			0

the flat , disc - shaped relics were unearthed in @entity10 in 1960
@entity17 article proposed their personal hygiene function
museum curator says he doubts they would have been comfortable to use
