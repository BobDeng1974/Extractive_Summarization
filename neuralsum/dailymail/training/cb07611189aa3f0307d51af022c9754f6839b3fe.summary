' in my early 60s i started to notice problems with my hips – just the occasional twinge here and there – and like most , i ignored the pains and got on with it , ' he said			0
' however , my left foot , back and knees also started to give me gyp - especially my back , which was becoming increasingly painful and stiff			1
i 've always lived a very active life and i put my aches and pains down to my age and the travelling i do for work			0

' the 67 - year - old first tried cod liver oil , taking it in its raw form , but admitted : ' there 's no charm in cod liver oil '			1
