eating out is a lottery with as few as half of the food outlets in some areas meeting hygiene requirements , it is claimed today			1
the warning comes from which ? , who say local councils in some areas are letting the owners of restaurants , cafes and takeaways get away with putting customers at risk			1
the consumer champion said half a million people suffer from food poisoning every year , yet people eating out are not getting the protection they deserve			2
it surveyed food hygiene reports submitted by all 398 local authorities in the @entity24 , based on their surveys of eating establishments in their areas , to the @entity29			2
only around half of the restaurants in @entity32 were meeting minimum health requirements , with @entity35 second on the list followed by @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 ( file image ) which ? said : ‘ we found @entity32 in @entity44 was the poorest performing local authority with only 54 per cent of its medium and high risk businesses meeting hygiene requirements			1
’ these requirements can range from simple things like ensuring there are proper hand washing facilities and keeping raw and cooked meat separate , to concerns about rats and mice			0
‘ @entity57 was second to bottom , with five other @entity44 councils in our bottom 10 - @entity37 , @entity60 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
’ others criticised for not doing enough to make food outlets clean up their act were the city of @entity65 , along with @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity69			0
which ? said : ‘ businesses are ultimately responsible for complying with hygiene rules but local authorities are tasked with enforcing compliance			2
' more than nine in 10 people said it is important that local authorities ensure compliance with food hygiene rules			0
’ the watchdog ’s executive director , @entity81 , said : ‘ our research reveals a shocking postcode lottery on food hygiene where in some places you may as well toss a coin before deciding which restaurant to trust with your health			0
‘ consumers expect local authorities to check that food businesses in their area comply with hygiene standards and rigorously enforce the rules			1
‘ local authorities should do more to make the best use of resources , respond effectively to risks across the food supply chain and ensure consumers are adequately protected wherever they live			0
’ which ? based its rankings on three criteria - the proportion of premises ranked as high or medium risk in a local authority that were compliant with food hygiene requirements ; the percentage of premises that had been rated for risk ; and the proportion of inspections and other follow ups that were carried out			1
@entity116 in @entity117 was rated as the best performing local authority for a second year running			1
it was ahead of @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , in @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , and @entity126			1
@entity32 council rejected the which ? findings , saying it had misunderstood the figures			1
it said the measures used by the consumer group failed to give proper weight to the fact its officials are particularly thorough and more likely than other councils to force the owners of dirty food businesses to take action			2
the council ’s @entity141 , @entity143 , said : ‘ we can say with confidence that their researchers clearly do not understand the figures they have used to rank local authority food safety teams ; that their interpretation of the data they have gathered is incorrect and their conclusions are nonsense			2
’ he said the work of @entity32 council was marked down by which ? because they are more likely to find a problem			1
mr @entity143 said this is because they are diligent and it was ‘ ludicrous ’ to suggest otherwise			0
‘ under the which ? assessment criteria , the more businesses you close or prosecute for hygiene failings the worse , the job you are doing , that is clearly a ridiculous suggestion , ’ he said			2
reasons for failing health requirements could range from simple problems such as not keeping raw and cooked meat separate , to larger concerns about mice and rats ( file image ) ‘ this research is so fundamentally flawed that i would not wrap my chips in the paper it is printed on			0
we think there are better ways of measuring the performance of food safety teams			0
’ he said @entity32 has the 10th highest number of prosecutions of food businesses in the country , it is 31st for the seizure of unfit food and 33rd for issuing improvement notices to food outlets they are worried about			1
the @entity199 said efforts to tackle dirty and dangerous restaurants are being hampered by big cuts in funding from the government			0
its regulation spokesman , @entity205 , said : ‘ councils are working hard to improve food safety standards and there is some excellent work being done in this area			1
' councils will always try to make the best possible use of the resources they have			0
however , they are being hamstrung by a 40 per cent core funding cut from government			0
‘ these figures do n’t necessarily reflect the challenges and circumstances that councils in different areas are tackling			0
' most importantly , it needs to be remembered that it is ultimately the responsibility of the outlets themselves to ensure food is produced in a safe environment that complies with the law			0

in @entity32 only half of high risk businesses are meeting safety standards
@entity35 , @entity37 , @entity60 and @entity38 complete five worst areas
@entity116 , @entity120 and @entity122 among the most hygienic
