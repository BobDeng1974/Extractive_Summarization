@entity0 goes in search of the all - time @entity3 goalscoring record in @entity6 ’s @entity5 stadium on wednesday with coach @entity7 admitting : ' he is the best player i have ever coached			1
' the words of praise came with @entity0 just three goals from @entity13 ’s @entity3 scoring record of 71			1
the man @entity16 fans tried to tempt back with a 20ft banner and a light aircraft at the weekend has 68 @entity3 goals and is homing in on the former @entity22 captain ’s haul			2
@entity22 superstar @entity0 is closing in on @entity13 's @entity24 goalscoring record former @entity16 ace ronaldo is currently three goals behind former @entity22 striker @entity13 1			1
@entity13 - 71 goals 2			2
@entity0 - 68 2 = @entity29 - 68 4			1
@entity34 - 46 8 = @entity35 - 46 10			0
@entity36 - 42 for mere mortals the gap might be too big to bridge in one match but having already scored 25 hat - tricks in his career @entity0 has a chance to equal that other famous @entity45 7 on wednesday night			1
@entity29 is also chasing down the record and drew level with his footballing nemesis after scoring against @entity49 on tuesday			2
@entity0 overtook @entity29 last season scoring 17 goals in 11 games in @entity22 ’s @entity3 - winning campaign , including a penalty in the final			1
he has scored 53 goals in 52 games in @entity57 for @entity22 , vastly improving his average at @entity16			1
@entity7 joked before the game			0
' his greater strike rate is all down to me playing him in a position where he can score more goals he knows that			0
' at the weekend @entity0 made a mockery of the idea that he might be slowing down as he approaches his 30th birthday by breaking the 20mph barrier in his run that led to @entity22 's second goal on saturday			2
@entity22 doctors believe he is back operating at the same speeds as before the injury problems that marred his end to last season and also inhibited him during the @entity76			0
he has had difficulties with his left knee and his left hamstring and he has already missed one game this season – @entity22 ’s away defeat by @entity82			0
but the sprint against @entity84 seems to suggest he is back to his explosive best			0
@entity7 has said @entity0 is the best player he has ever coached during his managerial career @entity87 's @entity29 has also scored 68 goals in @entity57 after he netted against @entity49 it ’s not the first time this season he has shown his athletic prowess – he leapt to over 2.6 metres for the headed goal he scored in @entity22 ’s 8 - 2 win over @entity94 recently			1
it ’s little wonder @entity16 fans keen on his return do n’t seem too worried about the fact that he will turn 30 next february			0
his goal at the weekend meant he had reached 10 goals in a league season earlier than any player in the club ’s history and faster than anyone in @entity107 since @entity108 for @entity94 in 1954			0
@entity22 ’s opponents @entity109 nearly took a point from @entity112 in their opening group game and play their first home match in the @entity3			2
they do so without genuine home advantage , however , because their 6,100 capacity @entity117 does not meet @entity57 ’s minimum requirements and so they must play 324 km away in the national stadium in @entity120			0
around 5,000 fans will make the five - hour trip to watch their team and many of the the remaining 40,000 tickets have been snapped up by @entity127 supporters in the capital as anxious to see @entity0 as they are to see how @entity109 fare			1
@entity0 , here scoring against @entity129 in the 2014 @entity3 final , has won two @entity24 cups @entity132 : ronaldo highlights			0

@entity0 scored a hat - trick for @entity22 in their win over @entity137
the @entity140 star is three goals behind former @entity22 ace @entity13
@entity0 is in line to start against @entity127 outfit @entity109
@entity87 's @entity29 , like @entity0 , has scored 68 goals in @entity57
@entity7 has heaped high praise on @entity0 by stating he is the best player he has ever coached
