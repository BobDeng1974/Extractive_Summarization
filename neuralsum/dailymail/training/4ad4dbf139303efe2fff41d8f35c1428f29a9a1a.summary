by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 20:38 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:36 est , 18 february 2014 mps today rounded on @entity5 for complaining about ' yobbery ' and ' public school twittishness ' at @entity9 ’s questions			1
the @entity10 has written to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 warning the public risk being alienated from democracy by the ya - boo nature of the weekly confrontation			1
but @entity18 @entity4 hit back , accusing mr @entity5 of ' whining ' and losing control of the @entity20 because of his ' bias ' towards @entity22 , adding that one of his predecessors , @entity23 , had never felt the need to complain			2
alarm : @entity5 has written to the leaders of the three main political parties to demand talks on improving @entity30 it follows @entity1 's revelation that members of the public have written to mr @entity5 criticsing him directly for his handling of @entity30			1
some viewers accused the speaker of treating the prime minister ‘ like a two - year - old ’ and ‘ appalling behaviour ’ in letting @entity22 ‘ get away with saying what they want ’			2
despite @entity30 being the only regular event in parliament to gain any signiciant number of viewers , mr @entity5 has railed against the wall of noise that faces mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 in particular as they clash over the despatch box			1
but @entity18 mp @entity50 compared mr @entity5 's troubles to predecessor @entity52 who he said had ' no need to resort to whining ' while @entity54 said it was up to the speaker to not call people responsible for heckling			1
mr @entity5 's letter to the party leaders comes in the wake of a string of boisterous and loud exchanges which , according to a recent study , is alienating the public			1
but he also claimed ' good female ' mps were leaving @entity65 - with the charged comment that they were ' less inclined to screech and shout '			1
a @entity69 report revealed that 67 per cent of respondents felt ' there is too much party political points - scoring instead of answering the question '			2
only 12 per cent agreed that ' @entity30 makes me proud of @entity65 '			2
anger : @entity5 said people think prime minister 's questions ( pictured ) is very male , very testosterone - fuelled and , in the worst cases , full of yobbery and public school twittishness how @entity1 revealed details of letters sent to mr @entity5 last year mr @entity5 said he was not expecting mps to behave like ' trappist monks ' and appreciated ' passions will be aroused ' in the @entity20			1
but he added : ' there are people who think culturally the atmosphere is very male , very testosterone - fuelled and , in the worst cases , [ full ] of yobbery and public school twittishness '			1
the speaker told @entity93 that he regretted that ' some very good female members of @entity65 on both sides ' are leaving the @entity20 at the next election , and added that women were generally ' less inclined to screech and shout '			1
however mps suggested the solution to the problem lay with mr @entity5 himself			1
@entity18 @entity50 wrote on @entity103 : ' @entity104 needs to look in the mirror			0
@entity106 [ @entity23 ] never had the need to resort to whining			0
his biased approach is why he 's lost control of @entity30 's			2
' @entity54 , @entity18 mp for @entity110 , said : ' speaker could just stop calling the worst @entity30 hecklers & ban the crap planted " helpful " questions			1
' @entity115 , conservative mp for @entity116 , also wrote on @entity103 : ' @entity104 doctrine for @entity30 ? : narks never called			2
planted questioners told to sit down			0
' others on @entity103 were divided			0
@entity121 said : ' speaker @entity5 's complaints about heckling mps at @entity30 does n't make any sense when he has the power to decide which questions are asked			1
' @entity127 said : ' what is @entity5 talking about ? @entity30 would be very dull without any jeering			1
most views [ sic ] quite like it			0
' what viewers said about pmqs in letters to @entity5 @entity5 has warned people against passing judgement on his marriage to reality tv star @entity138			2
mrs @entity139 recently grabbed the headlines when photographs emerged of her kissing @entity142 and personal trainer @entity143 at a @entity145 nightclub			0
when asked about the pictures , mr @entity5 said : ' most people out there know that every family has its issues			2
' all marriages are different from each other and i think that there 's something to be said for people looking after their own business and allowing us to look after ours			0
' people should n’t assume that they know what is right or that it is necessary for them to prescribe for others			0
' @entity138 and i have known each other for a very long time and i think we ’re quite capable of looking after ourselves			0
' mrs @entity139 has also said in recent weeks : ' no marriage is perfect but ours works for us			0
' last year @entity1 revealed public disgust at ‘ braying ’ mps during prime minister ’s questions is laid bare today , in a catalogue of angry letters to mr @entity5 which branded them morons , t * * ts and a throwback to the 19th century			1
dozens of complaints were sent to the speaker 's office from september to november about the behaviour of heckling , insulting and guffawing mps in the @entity184			0
while the postbag fell short of the ‘ bucket loads ’ which mr @entity5 boasted of receiving every week , it revealed some of the anger at mr @entity11 and mr @entity12			0
mr @entity5 has been dogged by bad publicity since taking up the role as speaker , and he is seen by @entity4 as being biased towards the @entity22			1
letters , emails and web messages repeatedly accused mps of behaving like football hooligans , naughty schoolchildren , ‘ rowdy buffoons ’ , ‘ morons ’ and ‘ braying donkeys ’ who do not live in the real world			0
it is claimed @entity4 behave like 19th century ‘ public schoolboys ’ who think they are still in the @entity207 , the @entity209 dining society which counted mr @entity11 and @entity210 as members and is famed for smashing up restaurants			0
however mr @entity5 himself also faced criticism , with one letter warning ‘ revolution will be inevitable ’ if he is unable to act to curb the noise			0
a couple of letters even chided the speaker for complaining that the public do not like the noisy hullabaloo every wednesday at midday			0
one email said : ‘ i do not find the noise levels a problem at all ; the microphones in the chamber do an excellent job of amplifying the voices of the speakers			0
‘ i would far rather listen to @entity30 with the barracking and noise from the backbenchers , than having the speaker interrupt the prime minister and the @entity235 when they are in mid-sentence			2

commons speaker has written to party leaders to demand *reform* of @entity30
@entity5 says exchanges only add to growing public alienation with politics
he said @entity30 is seen by the public as overly male and testosterone - fueled
added that several ' good female ' mps have left politics *due* to the culture
