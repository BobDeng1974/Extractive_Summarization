as if travelling at @entity0 was n’t stressful enough			0
@entity1 has now unveiled a festive version of its notoriously annoying on - time jingle			1
passengers travelling on the budget airline over @entity0 will be treated to a blast of trumpets accompanied by a @entity9 message when their planes arrive on schedule			1
it has been created to replace the current bugle blast played over the aircraft ’s tannoy system when the flights arrive on time			1
the airline expect to carry 3.5million passengers over the @entity0 period			0
the music is accompanied a message that says : ‘ @entity0 from all of us at @entity1			1
‘ we wish you and your family a healthy and prosperous @entity9			2
see you on board in 2015			0
’ the new landing music has been unveiled in a festive video made by the airline ’s staff			2
the video was shot at @entity1 ’s @entity33 hq and features employees from the company dancing to the music			1
on time : @entity1 plays the @entity39 bugle blast every time one of its flights arrives on schedule there is even a cameo role from @entity1 chief executive @entity45 , who jokingly despairs at the music			1
passengers thought they would soon be hearing the end of the jingle after the airline announced it was scrapping the bugle blast following an online survey			1
it was in may this year that the flier gave in to people power after holding a vote via @entity57 over whether or not to keep the annoying refrain , whose official name is @entity39 and is used in the army			0
customers overwhelmingly voted to ditch the tune , a taped version of which is played over the speakers each time a flight lands on time			2
over the years , customers of the @entity33 - based carrier have regularly complained labelling the end of flight bugle call as ' annoying ' or ' cheesy '			2
huge criticism : @entity1 asked on @entity57 whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time @entity1 said it would drop the bugle following the @entity57 vote , but have now announced they will replace it with another tune next year			1
the move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline 's famously belligerent attitude to criticism			0
it has also followed some of its budget rivals by allowed allocated seating , fewer restrictions on luggage and an improved website for bookings			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity97 said in a statement : ' we asked our followers on @entity57 to vote on whether we should change it			0
' the people have spoken and after hundreds of votes , they 've voted for change , so we 're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon			0

passengers will be treated to a blast of trumpets and a @entity9 message
the jingle will be played every time a @entity1 plane arrives on schedule
the video features @entity1 employees dancing to the music
comes after customers voted to scrap the *original* bugle blast in may
