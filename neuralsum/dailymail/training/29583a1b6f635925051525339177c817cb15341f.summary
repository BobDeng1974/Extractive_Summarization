the image was taken by @entity14 ’s @entity13 spacecraft , which shows the view as it would be seen by human eyes			0
@entity13 ’s imaging team processed 141 wide - angle images to create the impressive panorama			1
an incredible natural - colour image of @entity2 , taken from space , shows the planet 's moons and rings as well as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 all together for the first time			1
the image was taken by @entity14 's @entity13 spacecraft , which shows the view as it would be seen by human eyes the picture , which was unveiled at the @entity28 in @entity29 today , takes in 404,880 miles across @entity2 and its inner ring system , including its striking rings out of the e ring , which is the planet ’s outer-most ring			1
to give an idea of the vast scale of the image , @entity14 said the distance between @entity7 and our moon would fit comfortably inside the span of the e ring			0
it is possible to see @entity7 as a bright blue dot to the lower right of @entity2 , while @entity8 is a bright dot to @entity2 ’s upper left			1
@entity9 also makes an appearance as a faint red dot , above and to the left of @entity8			0
curiously the image makes it look as if the planets are in the wrong order in the @entity53 , but it is a trick of perspective			0
a total of seven of @entity2 ’s moons are also visible , including @entity58 on the left side of the image			0
@entity13 even captured the icy plume emanating from the moon ’s south pole , which supplies fine , powder - sized icy particles that make up the e ring			0
the picture takes in 404,880 miles across @entity2 and its inner ring system , including its rings out of the e ring , which is the planet 's outer-most ring launched in 1997 , @entity13 has been exploring @entity2 and its series of moons since 2004			1
on @entity2 , a full year is the equivalent to 30 @entity7 years , meaning @entity13 has only been able to observe a third of a @entity2 year			2
since 2004 , @entity2 and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer			0
@entity13 has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004 , also observing @entity79 , the heliosphere , and testing the theory of relativity @entity13 is the fourth space probe to visit @entity2 and the first to enter orbit , and its mission is on going as of 2013			0
the e ring shimmers like a halo around @entity2 and the inner rings and is best seen with light shining from behind it so that the tiny particles are outlined with light because of the science of diffraction , @entity14 's scientists explained			1
‘ in this one magnificent view , @entity13 has delivered to us a universe of marvels , ’ said @entity95 , @entity13 's imaging team lead at the @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99			2
‘ and it did so on a day people all over the world , in unison , smiled in celebration at the sheer joy of being alive on a pale blue dot			0
’ the professional mosaic forms part of @entity13 ’s ‘ wave at @entity2 ’ campaign , which on july 19 , encouraged people to find @entity2 in their part of the sky and wave at it , sharing pictures over the internet			0
scientists examining @entity2 ’s rings use computers to dramatically increase the contrast of the images and change the colour so they can see material tracing out the orbits of tiny moons , such as @entity128 and @entity129 , for the first time			2
‘ the e ring in particular shows patterns that likely reflect disturbances from such diverse sources as sunlight and @entity58 ’ gravity , ’ she added			0
the reason why @entity13 does not attempt many images of @entity7 , is because the sun is so close to our planet that an unobstructed view would damage the spacecraft 's sensitive detectors			2
the professional mosaic forms part of @entity147 at @entity149 campaign , which on july 19 , encouraged people to find @entity2 in their part of the sky and wave at it , sharing pictures over the internet			0
this fun collage includes about 1,600 images submitted by members of the public as part of the campaign @entity160 , a @entity13 participating scientist at the @entity161 in @entity162 , said : ‘ this mosaic provides a remarkable amount of high - quality data on @entity2 ’s diffuse rings , revealing all sorts of intriguing structures we are currently trying to understand			2
the team had to look for an opportunity when the sun would slip behind @entity2 from @entity13 ’s point of view to get the shot			2
that opportunity arrived on july 19 , when @entity13 was able to capture a picture of @entity7 and its moon , as well as this multi-image , backlit panorama of the @entity2 system			1
in addition to taking images , @entity14 's @entity13 spacecraft has a mass spectrometer on - board to look at the composition of atmosphere			1
it recently examined the composition of @entity189 's atmosphere , to find that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere of the moon @entity193 , @entity13 project scientist based at @entity14 's @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity196 , said : ‘ with a long , intricate dance around the @entity2 system , @entity13 aims to study the @entity2 system from as many angles as possible			1
‘ beyond showing us the beauty of the @entity203 , data like these also improve our understanding of the history of the faint rings around @entity2 and the way disks around planets form - clues to how our own solar system formed around the sun. ’ launched in 1997 , @entity13 has explored the @entity2 system for more than nine years and will continue to do so until 2017 , with the aim of gathering more scientific data , and images of @entity2 and its rings and moons			1
images of the lakes near the north pole of @entity2 's moon , @entity189 , pictured , were taken by @entity14 's @entity13 as it entered its @entity222 season			1
this shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of @entity189			0

@entity14 's @entity13 imaging team processed 141 wide - angle images to create the impressive panorama
the picture takes in 404,880 miles across @entity2 and its inner ring system , including its rings out of the e ring , which is the planet ’s outer-most ring
it is possible to see @entity7 as a bright blue dot to the lower right of @entity2 as well as seven moons orbiting the planet
