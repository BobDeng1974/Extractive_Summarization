by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:27 est , 17 november 2013 @entity3 : 15:27 est , 17 november 2013 this computer image shows how specifically - designed plates will be used to reconstruct a road accident victim 's face using 3d printing technology			1
a team of @entity11 surgeons are poised to carry out a pioneering operation , which will restore the symmetry of a man ’s face using new parts produced by a printer			1
the unaffected side of the biker ’s face has been used to create a mirror image , which will enable perfect facial reconstruction			1
this image shows how a biker 's face is to be reconstructed after it was damaged in a road accident a computer image of ' scaffolding ' for a human ear			1
the model was created by @entity30 in @entity31 , but a similar one will be used to create the @entity32 printed part of the unknown man 's face computer images are being used to create titanium implants using @entity32 , which commonly known as 3d printing			1
the images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor - made implants for the patient			1
the guides and implants are being produced in medical - grade titanium in @entity47 , at one of the world ’s few specialist 3d printing facilities			1
surgeons in @entity52 , south @entity53 , used an x-ray ct scan to create minutely detailed three - dimensional images to design the bespoke implants			1
the futuristic work is led by consultant maxillofacial surgeon @entity58 , at @entity59 , @entity52 , run by @entity60			1
mr @entity58 said : ‘ effectively , we have done the surgery in virtual reality so that we can mirror this in real life			1
you can not make a mistake on a face			2
’ a scaffolding nose is pictured , which could help patients who needs reconstructive surgery			0
it relies upon using the patient 's own cells so that the body is less likley to reject a new osy part			2
unlike the nose pictured , the guides and implants used in the upcoming operation are being produced in medical - grade titanium the unaffected side of the biker ’s face has been used to create a mirror image			1
surgeons in @entity52 used an x-ray ct scan to create minutely detailed three - dimensional images			1
these images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones and create tailor - made implants for the patient			2
the guides and implants are being produced in medical - grade titanium in @entity47			2
the man 's injuries were so severe that when he was admitted to hospital , doctors focused on life - saving surgery rather than facial reconstruction			2
while half of his face was severely damaged , one side was unaffected			2
mr @entity58 has used a ct scan of this side of the face as a template to create implants in titanium using 3d printing			1
the operation will involve breaking and cutting several facial bones once again , but the 3d printing process will also produce guide devices allowing the surgeons to reposition bones with pinpoint accuracy			0
mr @entity58 said : ' we have a good chance of correcting 70 to 80 per cent of the deformity and we will make this man look a lot better			2
' the work is considered so groundbreaking and radical it already features in an exhibition at @entity128 ’s @entity127 , even before the operation itself has been carried out			0
@entity131 , a reconstructive scientist and @entity133 manager , said : ' the patient suffered trauma and had multiple injuries across his body , including some quite severe facial injuries			0
' he underwent emergency surgery at the time and we are now at the stage where we can do a proper reconstruction of his face			0
' the project is the work of the @entity148 in @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , established in 2006 as a partnership between @entity59 ’s @entity152 and @entity153 ( @entity153 ) based at @entity154			1
@entity150 aims to make @entity53 a world leader in the research , development and application of advanced medical technologies in surgery			0
mr @entity58 and mr @entity131 worked with @entity153 ’s @entity161 and @entity162 to virtually plan the complex surgery , which will involve repositioning the patient ’s facial bones			2
here , a finished ear , which consists of a coiled antenna inside a cartilage structure , is pictured			0
two wires lead from the base of the ear and wind around a helical ' cochlea ' - the part of the ear that senses sound - which can connect to electrod			0
it is just one example of a @entity32 printed organ mr @entity131 added : ' we have done everything up to the point of surgery			0
the concept of the operation has been virtually designed and we hope to do the work very soon			0
' the patient ’s facial symmetry will be restored so he should be back to normal as far as his facial looks are concerned			0
' discussions are now taking place to plan when the surgery itself will take place			0
the identity of the patient concerned has not been revealed			0
referring to the @entity128 exhibition , mr @entity131 said : ' the exhibition is all about cutting - edge activities in this area of work so to have this case appear there is amazing			0
' called @entity32 : printing @entity205 , the exhibition continues at the @entity127 until july 1 next year .			0
