if you appear in @entity1 , sooner or later you take a trip to the @entity3			0
for some characters , the plot decrees that it is the final journey from which there can be no return - as they are written out			0
about the only other place that exists for the people of @entity11 is @entity12 - and there have been spectacular fatalities there too ! happily , when i made my exit from the @entity1 , i was shown heading to @entity17 rather than up the @entity18			0
so the door may still be open for me to go back			0
but on the contrary , the prospect of a trip to the highly rated @entity31 lifted my spirits			1
my partner @entity34 and i had been to the @entity3 before , to visit @entity35			1
we liked it so much that this time we decided to explore further south , into @entity24 , and we had a fabulous time			1
recharging their batteries : @entity41 with her partner @entity44 and , right , the hotel 's pool the weather was n't terribly brilliant			1
in fact , it was as bad as it can be in the @entity26 , with the rain coming down in stair rods , so we spent most of our time warm and snug at the hotel			2
we spent a morning in the beautiful spa attached to the hotel			1
i had a head massage and @entity34 had a sport massage			1
indulging ourselves like this was just what we needed to recharge our batteries as the day before our trip we 'd moved house			2
highly rated : @entity41 's stay at the @entity31 lifted her spirits getting back to nature : @entity24 is the perfect place for fell walking - if the weather holds out i began to think it was lucky that it rained			1
if it had been sunny , we 'd have felt the need to do a bit of @entity76 and climb a couple of fells			2
instead we just relaxed … and ate			0
there is a great restaurant at the salutation and you can also dine well in the bar			0
i can especially recommend the afternoon tea , during which we had more scones , clotted cream and jam than was probably good for us			1
the rooms at the hotel are great			0
we were lucky enough to have one with a balcony deck area that overlooked @entity24			1
from the balcony we could see all the beautiful countryside and hills and mountains			0
pregnant pause : the former @entity1 actress is expecting a baby with her partner @entity34 an added bonus was the hot tub on our balcony			1
we were able to sit in there and watch the sun go down			0
actually , given the weather , it was more like watching the light disappearing , but it was lovely nonetheless			0
the @entity3 may be a place where bad things happen to @entity1 characters but i can definitely say that for me and @entity34 , it was all glorious			2
but then that 's the difference between soap operas and real life			0
in soap operas you can usually rely on an unhappy ending ... rooms at the @entity31 ( bestwestern.co.uk , 08457 737373 ) start at £ 114 half - board .			2

@entity122 took a short break in @entity24 with her boyfriend @entity34
the couple stayed at the @entity31
they recharged their batteries in the hotel 's spa and restaurant
indulged in afternoon tea and *chilled* out in their own hot tub
