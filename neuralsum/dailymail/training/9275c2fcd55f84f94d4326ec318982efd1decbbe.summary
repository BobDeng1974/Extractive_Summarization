@entity0 has announced plans to introduce matrix - style replays into its coverage of pro football			1
they will use @entity6 by @entity7 that have been used in @entity9 golf shows			0
this comes after @entity12 television network @entity13 announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion			1
@entity28 , the most watched show on television , will use one 24 - camera bullet time rig at each end zone			1
the technology will be installed by the first game in september between the @entity34 and @entity35 in @entity36			2
it will ensure that there is a back - up in case a referee makes a controversial or incorrect decision			0
@entity0 announced that they will use the technology from september @entity0 ’s @entity44 : ‘ we 're trying to be a show that really appeals to everybody			1
‘ we 're trying to [ show ] human beings behind the facemasks			0
’ @entity13 last month said they would use a robotic multi-camera system that has been developed in @entity12 and can record a single scene simultaneously from multiple angles			0
a computer can then stitch the individual images together to create a video clip of that scene , which can sped up or slowed down			0
the effect the system creates is called ' bullet time ' and is the same effect used in 1999 film @entity61 in which the main character @entity63 is shown dodging bullets in slow motion as a camera virtually moves the audience 360 - degrees around the shot			1
@entity13 's system uses eight cameras , each one used for various pans , tilts and zooms			0
these eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action			1
each of the remote - controlled ' @entity80 ' hdtv cameras is equipped with two motors for left - right pans , up - down tilts and zooms			0
@entity12 broadcaster @entity13 's system uses eight cameras , each one used for various pans , tilts and zooms			0
these eight cameras move in tandem with one main camera that can be moved around the action @entity93 is also known as frozen time , the big freeze , dead time , flow motion , or time slice			1
it is a special and visual effect that refers to a digitally enhanced simulation of variable - speeds , such as slow motion and time - lapse photography			1
it is used in films , adverts and video games			0
@entity93 slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience 's point of view			2
this is n't possible with traditional cameras because the cameras would have move round a scene at the same speed at which the event is taking place			0
the term ' bullet time ' is a registered trademark of @entity123 who first used it in march 2005 in the video game @entity127			1
it was also used to promote the 1999 @entity61 film			1
as the main camera moves , the eight cameras follow the action with it , pointed at different angles			2
this lets the cameras keep up with quickly moving players and provide multi-view imaging of the same event			0
this makes it possible for a single cameraman to operate all of the cameras and have them all pointing at the same moving object			0
the images are then automatically stitched together into video feeds and can be used within minutes for analysis during live sporting events			1
the broadcaster plans to trial the camera set - up during sports matches to check for fouls and when balls leave the court or pitch , for example			1
the system could also be used as an alternative to the @entity162 system that can slow down images during sports matches for analysis and refereeing decisions			1
@entity13 's system is similar to the set - up used by the @entity169 during the filming of their 1999 film @entity61			1
various scenes in the film are shown in slow - motion and the camera pans around a single shot			1
this led to the term ' bullet time ' being coined and trademarked by @entity123 , the film 's distributor			1
@entity93 is also known as frozen time , the big freeze , dead time , flow motion , or time slice			2

@entity93 slows the images down but also changes the camera angle by moving around the scene changing the audience 's point of view			2
the technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th - century experiments by @entity209			2
he used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse multi-view imaging involves surrounding the objects , such as sports players , with a number of cameras			0
these cameras can provide a virtual all - round view of the object at any one time			2
traditional cameras and systems can only capture objects from a limited number of viewpoints			0
to capture the full 360 - degree view , the cameras would have to travel around the object at the same speed at which the event happens which is impossible and would blur any images created			1
@entity13 designed the system to reduce the size of remote - controlled cameras currently used and speed up the capturing process			2
they showcased it at the @entity237 at the start of june			0
the technique of using a group of still cameras to freeze motion dates back to 19th - century experiments by @entity209			2
he used a line of cameras to record a galloping horse			0
@entity209 placed still cameras along a racetrack and each camera was attached to a piece of string stretched across the track			0
as the horse galloped passed the camera shutters snapped taking one frame of the galloping horse at a time .			2

@entity0 will use @entity61 - style 360 technology to film pro football
@entity28 will use two 24 - camera bullet time rigs
system can capture slow - motion *multi-angle* images of sporting events
it is a similar set - up to the one used during the filming of 1999 film @entity61
in the film , main character @entity63 is shown dodging and stopping bullets which led to the effect being *dubbed* ' bullet time '
