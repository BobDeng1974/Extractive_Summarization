a concert violinist diagnosed with a tremor was able to help surgeons locate the exact spot in his brain to place an implant by playing his instrument during the operation			1
@entity10 , a concert master with the @entity12 , was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors , a condition that occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals			1
@entity10 ’s condition was so mild that in many other line of work he might have been able to ignore it , but as a concert violinist it threatened his career			1
the surgery involved a tiny electrode being implanted into his brain , which doctors assured @entity10 would enable him to control the condition at the flick of a switch			1
in order for the electrode to work , it had to be implanted in exactly the right position , reports @entity51			0
because surgeons can operate on the brain without the patient feeling pain , it enables them to see in real time if and how the tremor is responding as they place the electrode			0
@entity10 's tremor was so mild that in many other lines of work he might have been able to ignore it , but as a concert violinist it threatened his career @entity10 now carries a device which allows him to turn his tremor off and on with the push of a button that controls the stimulator @entity10 ’s tremor was so mild , however , that his surgeon was worried he would not be able to tell whether the electrode had been properly placed			2
doctors then came up with the ingenious idea of using @entity10 's violin bow to help determine where his tremor was			1
an accelerometer was place on the end of @entity10 ’s bow which translated his tremor into a graph on a computer screen that surgeons could watch			2
so while surgeons fitted the electrodes , he played his violin			0
@entity10 underwent the operation in the @entity31 and since then he has resumed his position as @entity33 with the @entity12			1

@entity10 , a concert master with the @entity12 , was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors
the condition occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals
@entity10 agreed to undergo experimental surgery which involved tiny electrodes being implanted into his brain
in order to determine if the electrodes were being positioned correctly , @entity10 played his violin during the surgery in the @entity31
a month after the operation he was performing again with the orchestra and can now control his tremor with the flick of a switch
