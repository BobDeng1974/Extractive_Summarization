the rusty bronze fragments of the @entity1 , the world 's oldest computer , are 100 years older than scientists previously thought			1
previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			1
scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses the study , by the @entity30 , suggests that the process in which the computer predicts eclipses is @entity36 arithmetic , rather @entity21 trigonometry			1
this ancient device ' predates other known examples of similar technology by more than 1,000 years , ' according to a report by @entity42 in the @entity43			1
the highly complex mechanism , made up of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears , was used in ancient times to track the cycles of the solar system			1
it was recovered in 1900 from the @entity22 wreck - a @entity19 cargo shipwreck off the @entity21 island of @entity22			2
scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses , and record important events in the @entity21 calendar , such as the @entity61			1
the scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors , covered in instructions for its use			1
at the front was a single dial showing the @entity21 zodiac and an @entity73 calendar			1
on the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses			2
the calculator would have been driven by a hand crank			2
earlier this year , an expedition led by the @entity21 government returned to the ancient shipwreck of @entity22 using the @entity84 - a state - of - the art , deep sea diving suit @entity22 ( highlighted ) which now has a population of only 44 , was once one of antiquity 's busiest trade routes , and a base for @entity95 pirates , some of whom once captured and held the young @entity96 for ransom			0
he later had them all captured and crucified the device could track the movements of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 - the only planets known at the time , the position of the sun , and the location and phases of the moon			0
the researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19 - year calendar on the back of the mechanism			1
scientists have suggested that the mechanism might have been somehow linked to @entity119 , after a study found that language inscribed on the device			1
the inscriptions suggested it had been manufactured in @entity124 or in @entity125 , where @entity119 lived			0
but @entity119 was killed in 212 b.c. , while the ship carrying the device is believed to have sunk between 85 and 60 b.c. ' if we were all taking bets about where it was made , i think i would bet what most people would bet , in @entity137 , ' @entity127 , a specialist in the history of ancient mathematical sciences told @entity43			0
earlier this year , an expedition led by the @entity21 government returned to the ancient shipwreck of @entity22 using the @entity84 - a state - of - the art , deep sea diving suit			0
the group used the @entity84 to more than double the depth they can dive at , and stay safely at the bottom for longer			0
they brought back tableware , parts of the ship and a bronze spear			0
the now plan to dive again next spring in the hopes of uncovering more clues about the @entity1 's history			0
an exact replica of the @entity1 is displayed in @entity124 , @entity156 in @entity157 the @entity1 was recovered in 1900 from the @entity22 wreck - a @entity19 cargo shipwreck off the @entity21 island of @entity22			0
it was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches ( 340 × 180 × 90mm ) and consists of bronze dials , gears and cogs			0
a further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand - cut bronze gears			2
the mechanism is said to have been created in around @entity170 , and is believed to be the world 's oldest calculator			2
previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			1
scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses , and record important events in the @entity21 calendar , such as the @entity61			1
astronomer professor @entity185 of @entity186 said at the time : ' it is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years			1
' the scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors , covered in instructions for its use			2
at the front was a single dial showing the @entity21 zodiac and an @entity73 calendar			2
on the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses			0
the calculator would have been driven by a hand crank			0
the mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the @entity210 hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses			1
these include the @entity214 - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon , @entity217 and sun to the same relative positions			2
the device could track the movements of @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 - the only planets known at the time , the position of the sun , and the location and phases of the moon			0
the researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19 - year calendar on the back of the mechanism			1
the month names are @entity233 - suggest that it may have been built in the @entity233 colonies in north - western @entity157 or @entity125 in @entity236			0
the device was created at a time when the @entity19 had gained control of much of @entity157			0
the @entity1 is on display at the @entity242 in @entity243 .			0

this is according to @entity7 scientists who found eclipse calendar
the calender included a solar eclipse that happened on may 12 , 205 bc
previous radiocarbon dating analysis of had dates mechanism to 100 bc
the study suggests the maths it uses is based is @entity36 arithmetic
it predates other known examples of similar technology by 1,000 years
