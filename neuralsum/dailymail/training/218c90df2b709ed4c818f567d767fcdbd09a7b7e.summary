@entity1 scientists believe a giant crater which appeared in far northern @entity3 was caused by rising temperatures in the area - not a meteorite			1
@entity7 , a senior researcher at the @entity8 of the @entity9 , said the mysterious hole which appeared in the gas - rich area earlier this week was most likely the result of a ' build - up of excessive pressure ' underground , due to the region 's changing temperatures			1
on wednesday , mr @entity7 traveled to the 262ft wide crater , in the @entity19 of northern @entity1 , to study how the crater was formed			1
the two new craters follow the discovery of a larger hole earlier this month around 230ft ( 70 metres ) in diameter			0
now the new holes - smaller in diameter but similar in shape - are posing a fresh challenge for @entity1 scientists he said 80 per cent of the crater appeared to be made up of ice and that there were no traces of an explosion			1
the discovery eliminates the possibility that a meteorite had struck the region - the name of which translates as ' the @entity34 '			1
after the hole was discovered , there was speculation online about the crater indicating ' the arrival of a @entity80 craft '			2
but experts said the cause is more likely to be global warming releasing gases under the surface , which then explode like a @entity87 cork			0
the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates ' severe burning ' which scorched its edges , they say			2
when it was found , some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot in the @entity98 , which some 20 miles from the @entity100 gas field			0
the @entity101 reported how an expedition took place this week to find the source of the crater			0
the expedition organised by the @entity19 authorities included experts from @entity1 's @entity109 of the @entity9 , and also the @entity110 of the @entity111			1
@entity113 frost is seen near the hole in this photo			0
some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot , but that no longer seems to be the case scientists working at the site measure some of the soil and debris around the crater until the expedition took place , shown , scientists had been baffled by the appearance of the giant hole thanks to their readings ( shown ) the team now believes the cause was increasing temperatures it 's not yet known if this event , which scorched the ground nearby ( shown ) , could occur again in the area very remote : the crater has appeared in @entity19 - a large peninsula jutting into @entity9 waters , which is @entity1 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity145 the @entity146 is area known for its permafrost and pingos the mysterious hole is in the @entity98 , some 20 miles from the @entity100 gas field they took samples of soil , air and water from the scene and were accompanied by a specialist from @entity1 's @entity159			1
@entity160 from the @entity161 , thinks the crater was formed by a mixture of water , salt and gas igniting an underground explosion , a result of global warming			0
gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface , and then mixed with salt			0
some 10,000 years ago this area was a sea			0
global warming may have caused an ' alarming ' melt in the under - soil ice , released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a @entity87 bottle cork , ms @entity160 suggests			0
@entity19 , a large peninsula jutting into @entity9 waters , is @entity1 's main production area for gas supplied to @entity145			1
scientists are seen here on the way to the crater during their expedition shown is a piece of soil that was ' ejected ' out of the original crater			0
the crater is different from others on @entity19			2
the experts say the phenomenon maybe a restarting of a process not seen for 8,000 years when the lake - pocked @entity19 landscape was formed on what was once a sea here can be seen permafrost , soil below the freezing point of water , near the crater the edge of the terrifyingly large , original crater is seen here			2
one favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground a bird is seen here on top of the crater 's wall the @entity19 crater is visible in this aerial view another aerial view shows how out of place the hole looks in the environment			1

enormous crater appeared *suddenly* in part of @entity1 , @entity19 , where name translates as ' the @entity34 '
some thought the *unusual* and rare *geographical* occurrence , which was 262ft wide , was caused by a meteorite
@entity7 from @entity8 of the @entity9 says crater was probably due to rising temperatures
