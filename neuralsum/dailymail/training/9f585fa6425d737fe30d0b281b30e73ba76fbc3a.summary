by @entity0 a mother who was so addicted to sugar she consumed the equivalent of 50 teaspoons a day has told how kicking the habit has transformed her life			1
@entity6 ate chocolate biscuits for breakfast , substituted supper with puddings and raided the sweet cupboard during years of overindulgence to satisfy her cravings			1
yesterday , the 45 - year - old said that while her sugar habit did not cause her weight to balloon , it was an ‘ emotional crutch ’ that she turned to for a pick - me - up or even because she was bored			1
unhealthy : @entity20 addict @entity6 with a typical day 's menu , including crisps , soft drinks and chocolate the mother - of - two said her addiction was so severe that when she quit sugar she would often burst into tears and was short - tempered , listless and depressed			1
she also suffered severe headaches			2
‘ it took a fortnight for those feelings to subside , ’ she said			0
‘ everywhere i looked there were people eating bags of sweets , ice - creams and drinking fizzy drinks			1
i would walk up the aisles looking at the biscuits , feeling like crying , i wanted them so much			1
‘ it was a cycle – i ate sugary foods as a pick - me - up , but after the high came a low and i would need more			0
‘ but once i ’d got through those first few weeks i started to feel so much better – calmer but more alert and with more energy			0
’ in the old days , if mrs @entity6 did have proper meals they consisted of sugar - laden cereal bars for breakfast , sandwiches with crisps and cake for lunch and processed ready meals for dinner with dessert			1
occasionally she would cook a curry or sweet and sour dish but the sauce would be from a jar and therefore high in sugar			2
throughout the day she would snack on cookies , pies , sweets and chocolate bars			1
she would also sip on fizzy drinks all day			2
now , however , she has porridge for breakfast , chicken or ham salad for lunch and snacks on oatcakes with low - fat hummus , berries and natural yoghurt sprinkled with nuts or raisins			0
instead of relying on microwaveable meals for dinner , she cooks curries , stir - fries and spaghetti bolognese from scratch without sauces from jars			0
healthier : since being diagnosed a sugar addict and put on a diet , @entity6 says she 's much healthier upsetting : @entity6 says her sugar addiction left her in tears while navigating the supermarket sweet aisle and mrs @entity6 , who works as a childminder and lives in @entity95 , @entity96 , with electrician husband @entity97 , also 45 , has cut out puddings completely			1
she had always jogged and now she is running faster than ever			0
her weight has also dropped from 9st 11lb to 8st 7lb			0
to help her change her ways , mrs @entity6 contacted @entity101 , which works with companies to educate workers on diet and wellbeing to improve health and cut absenteeism			2
its specialists deemed her a sugar addict			2
@entity111 , who runs the company , warned yesterday that sugar could be ‘ more powerful than any opiates ’ and said @entity115 is ‘ hooked on processed food ’			2
she added : ‘ many people on an apparently healthy diet can be consuming 40 to 50 teaspoons of sugar a day eating things like granola bars – which are held together with sugary syrup – or baked beans , which have sugar in the sauce			1
’ mrs @entity6 has been on a no - sugar diet since last september because even the smallest amount can reignite her cravings			1
however , she admitted that she has occasionally been unable to resist temptation and recently had a gingerbread biscuit when baking with the children she cares for			0
she said of her addiction : ‘ it takes hold after the first few mouthfuls of intense pleasure – i would start putting food into my mouth , even though i do n’t really want it			0
‘ your head is telling you to stop , but you just ca n’t			0
’ the recommended daily sugar intake for a woman is six teaspoons , according to the @entity143 , but the typical @entity144 will consume double that			0
at a time when obesity and diabetes cost the @entity115 more than £ 5billion a year , campaign group action on @entity20 is calling on food manufacturers to cut the sugar in their products by 20 to 30 per cent within the next three to five years			0
improvement : @entity6 , pictured with sons @entity154 and @entity156 last september , has been on a sugar - free diet			1

@entity6 , 45 , from @entity95 , was eating a huge 50tsp of sugar a day
mound of sweets left her depressed , listless and *plagued* by headaches
has been diagnosed with sugar addiction and banned from eating it
