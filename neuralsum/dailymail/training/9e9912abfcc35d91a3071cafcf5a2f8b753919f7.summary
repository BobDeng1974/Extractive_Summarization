by day , well - spoken @entity0 is a serious businesswoman running her own cleaning firm			1
but by night , she transforms herself into a sexy , self - styled ' queen of the chavs ' female wrestler			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity6 has been impressing fans with her loudmouth alter - ego ' @entity9 '			1
when in character , she wears pink @entity13 hot - pants , a diamante encrusted cap and gold chain			2
she was first introduced to the sport as a child when her older brother and his friends used to try out their combat moves on her after watching wrestling shows			2
since taking up the sport , super-fit @entity0 has had two teeth knocked out and once had to go to @entity34 after her head was slammed on the floor of the ring			1
this week she is preparing for a title fight in her home town of @entity6			0
the unusual hobby has taken a toll on @entity0 , who has even had teeth knocked out in the ring if successful , she hopes to give up her cleaning career and become a full - time competitor on the wrestling circuit in @entity31			1
she said : ' i decided on my alter ego of @entity9 because it is the furthest thing from me			1
i hate chavs and it gave me the opportunity to really play at being someone else			2
' it gives me a chance to rebel which is really fun because i 'm still living at home with my mum and do cleaning during the day , so it 's a complete change of scene			2
' it 's hilarious , i get in the ring and start behaving like a juvenile delinquent			0
i 'm usually the villain so the more people that boo , the better			0
' i got into it as a kid when my brother used to watch it			0
his friends would come round and try all their wrestling moves on me			2
' @entity0 says wrestling is her way of rebelling and hopes to soon be able to quit her cleaning job to compete in the sport full time she added : ' @entity76 had to take me to @entity34 once because they did a ' @entity78 ' on me and i banged my head really badly			1
' but i still loved it , and when i got the chance to go and try it about five years ago it was amazing			0
' so as soon as i got a car i started going to training in @entity85 every week , and started thinking about an alter - ego			1
' when i began entering actual shows at the beginning of this year i had to have a definite character , and since chavs are n't particularly popular anyway i thought that would be funny			1
' people shout stuff at me all the time when i 'm in the ring but i play up to it , i just like to pretend i 'm @entity97 or that @entity99 character , @entity98			2
' my dream is to get picked up by @entity101 , which is the development branch for @entity103 in @entity104			0
' that would be absolutely amazing , but i know i will have to work really hard to achieve that			0
@entity0 says she picked her ' chav ' character when she began competing in shows as she thought it would be funny and it allows her to play the villain in the ring ' at the moment we usually get about two hundred people coming to shows , and there is always one female fight on the ticket			1
' my mum comes to watch sometimes , and my friends have been along too and they just think it 's hilarious			0
' i set up my own company cleaning people 's homes just before i got into wrestling three years ago , because i knew i was going to need a flexible job if i 'm going to pursue this long term			1
' @entity0 's mother , @entity128 , 57 , who works as a carer , fully supports her daughter 's unusual sport			1
she said : ' i really like the wrestling too			0
' my dad used to make us watch it , and i was n't sure about @entity0 getting into it because i thought there were no other girls interested , but there are			1
' i 've been to see her a few times now and enjoyed it a lot			0
' people have only heard of the @entity31 wrestling usually but the standard of @entity28 wrestling is really good too			1
' promoter @entity146 said he believed she has what it takes to make it in @entity103 , the world 's biggest wrestling corporation			0
he said : ' i really think she 's got what it takes to make it			0
she 's very determined , she 's physical and she 's very attractive as well			0
' i truly believe she 's got the quality they look for in the @entity103			0
' i had one young lady who went to @entity31 to work for @entity103 but it was n't really her cup of tea and she came back after a few months			2
