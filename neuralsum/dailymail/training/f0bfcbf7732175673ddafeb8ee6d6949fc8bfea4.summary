@entity0 is poised to take a step closer to realising his dream of a return to @entity4 this week			1
talks have been ongoing over a one year player - coach contract which will see the 36 - year - old @entity8 idol reunited with mentor @entity9			1
@entity0 is understood to have already texted some of his former @entity4 teammates to hint at his return			1
his experience and winning mentality can influence those around him while he has the ability to make an impact from the bench as he provides cover for main striker @entity36			0
@entity4 have spent well this summer and will continue to add but have lost @entity37 and @entity38 while @entity39 could yet join @entity40 despite initially being recalled into the fold			0
a player - coach contract though would also fall more comfortably into @entity44 guidelines as part of his wages would be absorbed into the coaches budget			0
@entity0 first signed for @entity4 ten years ago and left in 2012			2
to confirm his departure , @entity0 told the club 's official website : ' i wanted to put an end the speculation and confirm that i am leaving @entity4			1
it has been a very difficult decision for me to make and i am very proud of what we have achieved			0
but the time is right for a new challenge for me			0
as a team we have accomplished so much and have won every single trophy possible			0
' milking the applause : @entity0 shows his appeciation to the fans during his last game at @entity8 in blue journeyman : spells at @entity70 and @entity71 followed @entity0 's @entity4 departure @entity73 weighs up @entity4 return he returned last season as an opponent in the @entity77 with @entity71 and was presented with a thank you gift of a silver boot on behalf of the club			1
his return will be welcomed by supporters and will strengthen @entity9 's position within the club			2
yet fans will still be demanding another , younger striker or that @entity4 keep @entity39			0
much will depend though if the @entity90 is willing to play second fiddle to @entity36 and @entity40 are poised with an offer to give him the starting place he demands			0
meanwhile , @entity4 are sending new signing @entity95 out on loan to @entity98 for the 2014/15 season			1
the @entity101 under - 21 midfielder spoke to 24sata about the move revealing : ' as i went to say goodbye to my manager @entity9 , he told me that i 'm on the best way to one day return to @entity4			1
' he also told me that i must do my best on loan in @entity109 because he will keep track of all my games			2
director of sport @entity113 also told me that he and @entity9 will come to see me in @entity109			2
i like this option from @entity98 ... i always dreamed that i would play in @entity116 once			0
' return ? @entity0 was @entity4 's hero in the 2012 @entity77 final win over @entity118			1
