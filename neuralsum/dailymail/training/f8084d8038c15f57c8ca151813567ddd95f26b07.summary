by @entity0 here 's the outstanding stat of the weekend for you			1
on his full league debut , @entity3 , @entity4 ’s 19 - year - old midfielder , made 106 passes			1
that ’s more passes than any other player in the @entity10 and he completed 93.4 per cent of them , too			1
cool , calm , collected : @entity3 ( right ) impressed with his passing as @entity4 beat @entity14 pass master : @entity3 's successful passes are in blue ( left ) , and his touch map shows his involvement ( @entity20 ) going for goal : @entity3 ( right ) curls a shot round @entity23 pass master : @entity3 made just six fewer passes then @entity27 's @entity26 ( left ) did against @entity28 he made 17 more than the next best , his team - mate @entity29 ( 89 ) , more than double @entity30 ( 50 ) and was only six shy of @entity27 ’s pass master @entity26 ( 112 )			1
people say anybody can make five - yard passes , but if they think that ’s easy , they are kidding themselves			1
for a teenager to come in and play the way he has is unbelievable			0
@entity37 knows him from the youth set - up and he certainly knows a thing or two about playing in midfield			2
but @entity3 ’s ability belies his age			1
he is confident and plays with a nice arrogance , as if he ’s saying : ‘ here i am , give me the ball			0
’ it was a brave decision to blood the youngster , but it looks like one that will pay off			0
@entity51 's week to remember @entity51 has had a great week			1
it started with @entity55 ’s @entity54 third - round win over @entity56 when he scored a wonderful free - kick			1
then he came on as substitute against @entity59 last tuesday in the @entity61 semi-final and won the all - important penalty			2
now he ’s the proud owner of saturday ’s match ball after producing a sublime performance against @entity65 and scoring a well - deserved hat - trick			2
he hugged that right - hand side , as his touch map shows ( below ) , and he was so effective on the break			2
there was talk only a few weeks ago that @entity55 wanted to offload the wide man as they were not happy with his input			0
@entity75 probably thought he was n’t up for the fight ahead and before this week i would have had to agree			0
but now it ’s like having a new player			0
i have written in this column before about his talent and at times it has been wasted			2
people may start talking about an @entity86 call and that may be premature , but i really hope the penny has dropped			0
he has great ability and if he starts to show that on a regular basis , then the fans will be right behind him			2
hugging the touchline : @entity51 's pitch - map showed his devastating effect on the wing for @entity55 @entity98 : @entity51 scores the first of his three goals as @entity55 eased to victory over @entity65 finisher : @entity51 scores @entity55 's third goal as they closed in on a valuable three points hat - trick hero : @entity51 completes his treble from the penalty spot as he grabs @entity55 's fourth goal @entity109 does it : @entity51 celebrates after completing his hat - trick and with the match ball the @entity113 are back it was a hell of a game at the @entity116 on sunday , and @entity117 were absolutely formidable in attack			1
they were almost more dangerous out of possession , sucking @entity121 in then attacking on the break with real venom			0
then you had the return of the @entity113			0
to see @entity126 and @entity127 back at it was fantastic , scoring goals and setting each other up			0
taking off @entity131 and sending on @entity132 shows their depth , and if you ’re a tired opposition defender , it ’s a nightmare			0
and what more can you say about @entity127 ? he ’s like the @entity135			0
he pretends to not be interested , pick - pockets the opposition and then explodes			2
sharp shooter : @entity127 scored twice for @entity117 as they edged out @entity121 on sunday afternoon he 's back : @entity126 announced his return from injury with a goal at the @entity116 @entity143 's unsung hero @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 have been taking the headlines for @entity143 this season , but for me there ’s absolutely no doubt who their unsung hero has been : @entity155			1
it started with his debut when @entity143 beat @entity158 1 - 0 at @entity159 back in september and he has maintained a very high standard all season			1
a lot of @entity143 fans would have raised their eyebrows when the signing was made , but he has been a revelation in their midfield			1
in september he played in his 500th @entity10 game against @entity170 , which shows you just how long he ’s been a top player and he scored his 50th @entity10 goal with a beauty against @entity176			1
he keeps things simple , but executes them so well and with his experience he has almost acted like a minder for @entity143 ’s young stars this season			1
main man : @entity155 has impressed all season for @entity143 and helped himself to a goal against @entity176 losing control it was no surprise to see @entity187 with 61.4 per cent possession on saturday			1
what was surprising was that it came at @entity191			0
it did n’t feel like they dominated and , for all their work with the ball , they do n’t create enough			0
but it does show @entity59 ’s anxiety at home			1
they are not playing with any freedom			0
@entity158 away next week is massive for them , but of the top nine @entity59 have beaten only @entity202			0
they will need to be at their best to get anything from @entity206			0
home disadvantage ? when you ’re in a relegation scrap home games are vital , but sometimes you can actually be better on the road			2
the bottom four played each other on saturday , but it was the away teams — @entity214 and @entity55 — who won			1
home advantage helps , but there can be real tension and fear , especially if you concede			2
away , there ’s less pressure and you can counter-attack			2
that ’s exactly what happened this weekend			0
pile on ! @entity214 celebrate a vital win away to @entity227 that helps ease their relegation worries @entity230 are on the up it 's easy to forget about friday night games , but @entity230 ’s 4 - 1 win over @entity235 was the performance of the weekend			1
they had pace , power and have a balanced and hungry squad			0
with a four - point lead , they look certainties to come up			1
the only thing that will stop them is themselves			0
last season in january they were second , but slipped to finish sixth , so it ’s about whether they can cope with the pressure or if nerves will get the better of them .			1

@entity4 ' @entity3 could become a @entity10 pass master
@entity51 needs to *consistently* show his talent
@entity155 has been @entity143 's under - rated star this season
less pressure away from home lead to a @entity214 win
