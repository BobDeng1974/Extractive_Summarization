by @entity0 published : 15:00 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 31 may 2012 a ' supervolcano ' eruption is the most catastrophic natural disaster that can hit our planet , short of an asteroid impact - and now scientists believe they may build up a deadly head of steam far faster than we thought			1
instead of the process taking hundreds of thousands of years , it could take just hundreds			2
the news could be bad for the @entity13 , where a supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath @entity15			1
if it erupted , two thirds of the country could be rendered uninhabitable			0
eruption : @entity20 with the power to destroy human civilisations may build up a deadly head of steam far faster than scientists believed supervolcanoes are fuelled by giant pools of magma that form deep underground			1
geologists had thought it took between 100,000 to 200,000 years for a supervolcano magma pool to build up enough pressure to erupt			1
but the new study suggests that the giant magma bodies may only exist for a few thousand years , or even a few hundred , before exploding			0
a magma reservoir six miles below @entity15 has been rising at a record rate since 2004			2
the @entity40 park sits above a gigantic plume of hot and molten rock that begins at least 400 miles beneath @entity44 's surface and rises to 30 miles underground , where it widens to about 300 miles across			2
blobs of magma occasionally break off from the top of the plume , and rise farther , resupplying the magma chamber beneath the @entity51			0
steaming @entity52 at @entity15 in winter			0
researchers now believe that the supervolcano beneath the park could be more active than thought the news could be bad for the @entity13 , where a supervolcano is said to be simmering beneath @entity15			1
if it erupted , two thirds of the country could be rendered uninhabitable @entity62 and sunrise @entity15 @entity40 : researchers now believe that the huge ' supervolcano ' beneath the park is far more active than previously thought resembling the lid of a cooking pot , the caldera formed when the last super-eruption occurred 600,000 years ago			1
the supervolcano has erupted a total of three times in the last 2.1 million years			0
scientists believe it could be due to erupt @entity77 full scale eruption at @entity15 would be 1,000 times more powerful than the volcanic blast that tore apart @entity79 in @entity80 is evidence that a similar super-eruption in @entity83 74,000 years ago came close to wiping out the entire human @entity85 new study was based on analysis of a super-eruption that occurred in eastern @entity88 760,000 years @entity90 independent lines of evidence indicated that the magma pool erupted within a few thousand years , perhaps within a few hundred years , covering half the @entity94 continent with smouldering ash.the scientists based their estimate on quartz crystallisation rates			1
previous studies have relied on the growth of zircon crystals , which is said to be a less accurate @entity102 research is published in the online journal @entity105 scientist dr @entity104 , from @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , said : ‘ our study suggests that when these exceptionally large magma pools form they are ephemeral and can not exist very long without erupting			0
‘ the fact that the process of magma body formation occurs in historical time , instead of geological time , completely changes the nature of the problem			0
’ he said regions such as @entity15 should be monitored regularly to provide advance warning of a catastrophic super-eruption .			0

most deadly event that can hit @entity44 short of asteroid
scientists believed they took 100,000 years to build up
instead , figure could be just hundreds
