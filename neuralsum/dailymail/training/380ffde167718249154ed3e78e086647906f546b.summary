a daredevil attempting a 6,500ft paragliding jump narrowly cheated death after his parachute became tangled in mid-air			1
@entity5 , a 43 - year - old it consultant from @entity6 , had launched himself off the 6,200ft - high @entity7 in @entity8			1
shortly afterwards , the lines of the thrillseeker 's parachute became twisted , causing him to lose control of the glider			2
mr @entity5 is then seen trying to pull in the tangled glider in order to stop it dragging him off - course and into a nearby beach resort packed with holidaymakers a small camera strapped to mr @entity5 's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea			1
despite remaining calm , he is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider before opening up his reserve parachute			1

during his ordeal the lines of his glider also wrapped around his arms , resulting in painful burns as he attempted to land safely			0
after a couple of minutes , mr @entity5 is shown landing into the sea below before being rescued by a nearby safety boat			2
a small camera strapped to @entity5 's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea @entity5 had launched himself off the 6,200ft - high @entity7 in @entity8 before the incident mr @entity5 explained that he was an experienced paraglider , having completed around 65 flights previously			1
he had joined up with the @entity45 where he was receiving training from instructor @entity47 about how to deal with emergency situations			0
it was the last flight on the training course , and @entity5 was learning how to carry out a full stall – a tricky safety procedure employed by paragliders to regain control and balance the glider in extreme weather conditions			2
he had already completed the manoeuvre perfectly twice before , but made a mistake on his third and final attempt which caused his lines to become tangled			0
despite remaining calm , @entity5 is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider b asked what was going through his mind as he realised he was in trouble , @entity5 said : ‘ i had done two full stalls already and just did not complete the last one correctly			2
' i lost control and the wing shot underneath me , which can be very very dangerous			0
' if you fall into the wing cloth when it is below you , you end up “ gift wrapped ” and can not throw your reserve parachute – being gift wrapped is a likely end of life experience			1
‘ once i realised i had lost control of my glider , there were a few four letter words that ran through my head			0
‘ but we do it over water , with a safety boat below for the very reason things can go wrong , as was my case			0
after a couple of minutes , @entity5 is shown plummeting into the sea before being rescued by a safety boat ‘ once i had thrown my reserve ‘ chute , the main aim was to get my glider in , as it was down pulling me down wind , meaning i was heading towards the beach and the town of @entity100			1
‘ my instructor @entity47 was a diamond and it was with his instructions that i was able to learn to fly and to do stuff like this			0
' in 2010 , 70 - year - old grandfather - of - two @entity107 escaped death after breaking his shoulder , elbow and foot when his tandem paraglider pilot crashed into the side of a mountain near to @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity115 is hugely popular with tourists who pay around £ 50 to do a paragliding jump			0
the mountain ’s height and proximity of its summit to the sea makes it particularly suitable for such extreme sports .			0

@entity5 , a 43 - year - old it consultant , was paragliding in @entity8
his lines became twisted sending him plummeting towards the sea
