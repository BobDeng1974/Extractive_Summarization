climbing trees and spending hours playing outside used to be part of every childhood			2
but today ’s youngsters are more likely to be stuck indoors – and it may be harming their eyesight			1
and it is not just because of the time spent sitting in front of a screen			0
for a lack of natural daylight is thought to be driving up rates of short - sightedness among the young			1
spending an extra 40 minutes a day in the sunshine has been shown to improve children ’s sight dramatically			1
scientists had though reading or looking at a screen could cause shortsightedness , but now think it could be down to a lack of natural light while taking part in these activities ( file image ) in @entity30 , where four teenagers in five are short - sighted , transparent classrooms are being tested in a bid to increase pupils ’ exposure to natural light			1
@entity30 scientists have reported a 23 per cent reduction in myopia – short - sightedness – in children who spend an extra 40 minutes a day in the sunshine			1
studies in @entity42 and by @entity43 in the @entity44 produced similar results			0
leading eye surgeon @entity46 warned that an increase in eyesight problems is likely in @entity49 if children do not regain a love of the great outdoors			2
two in five adults in this country are short - sighted , but mr @entity46 said those rates are likely to increase			0
‘ for 100 years we have researched into the effects of reading and prolonged study on making short - sightedness worse , ’ he said			2
‘ it has become a common belief that spending too much time inside a book , or today on a screen , will make anyone ’s eyesight worse			0
‘ recent research might have turned this on its head			0
that ’s why today some @entity30 schoolchildren are going to school inside a big glass box			1
there are several studies showing that lack of daylight might be the principal reason why children become more short - sighted , rather than prolonged reading			1
study shows that 40 minutes of extra natural light per day , by playing outside or climbing trees , could help to reduce cases by 26 per cent ( file image ) ' what was n’t factored into our decades of research was that reading and studying are done indoors , away from daylight			1
‘ the link between studying and myopia might really be a red herring , where the close vision activity is just a proxy for lack of daylight			0
’ @entity96 , who led the @entity98 study , told the journal nature : ‘ we thought it was an odd finding but it just kept coming up as we did the analyses			2
’ mr @entity46 , who runs @entity103 in @entity104 , said : ‘ the incidence of short sight in the @entity107 is rising , now affecting around 40 per cent of the population			0
‘ if we look at hunter - gatherer societies that live mainly outdoors , such as those studied in @entity111 , we find that only 0.5 per cent of adults are afflicted by short sight			0
‘ @entity30 children are participating in research to determine if more exposure to daylight will protect them from their myopic genes			1
‘ if [ it ] is shown to help it might mean we all got outdoors more often			0
it could be time to invest in conservatory companies			0
