by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:38 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 13 september 2013 @entity3 minister @entity2 said the open door policy for @entity6 workers had benefited @entity7 workers from @entity9 and @entity10 expected to flock to the @entity7 next year are no different to @entity11 who own holiday homes in @entity13 or @entity14 , a @entity3 minister has claimed			1
@entity16 @entity2 insisted he was relaxed about the numbers of migrant workers who could come to @entity7 when working limits on the two countries are lifted next year			1
and he hit out at the @entity7 @entity21 for wanting to ‘ pull the drawbridge ’ to the outside world			1
mr @entity2 , who is widely seen as a leading figure on the right of the @entity16 , defended the open door policies which have seen hundreds of thousands of people from @entity28 move to the @entity7			1
he told the @entity30 magazine that he is in the ‘ unfashionable minority ’ the influx of @entity28 workers to the @entity7			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t think there was a mistake			2
it was transformational in terms of @entity7 ’s relationship with countries like @entity40			0
‘ it was in our foreign policy interest but , at a much more direct , micro level , there are lots of employers in my constituency and around the country who are full of praise for the contribution that @entity40 have made to their businesses and the economy more generally			2
’ the government has refused to publish forecast for the number of @entity9 and @entity10 who might move to @entity7 , after @entity59 failed to accurately predict how many @entity40 would come here for work			2
but mr @entity2 said : ‘ they ’re only complying with the same rules as @entity7 people who live in @entity14 or have holiday houses in @entity13 , or who work in @entity66			1
’ he conceded that immigration has put pressure on public services , but added : ‘ i think if you look at the overall ledger			2
the positives outweigh the negatives			0
’ with @entity75 ahead of the @entity16 in most polls , the junior coalition partner risks being eclipsed by the @entity78 party led by @entity79			1
but mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ essentially , the big choice the country faces is not really embodied that well by the two biggest parties : it is represented by the @entity16 and @entity75			1
that ’s where it ’s thrown into stark relief			0
’ the number of @entity9 and @entity10 workers in the @entity7 has risen dramatically in the last decade he said it is a choice between ‘ pulling the drawbridge up , erecting barriers to the outside ’ , and ‘ being a welcoming , liberal , outward - looking , internationalist country that embraces the opportunities of globalisation ’			1
even before the immigration rules change figures already show about 100 @entity9 and @entity10 a day are getting jobs in @entity7			0
the number of people from the two @entity6 countries has soared by more than a third over the past year , even though they are not yet allowed to work freely in this country			0
the number here has reached a record high of 141,000 , according to the @entity104 – over-shadowing the total number of @entity106 and @entity107 for the first time since records began			0
there are already fears of an influx of @entity9 and @entity10 next year when current restrictions on their rights to work in @entity7 are lifted			0
at present , they can only work here if they are self - employed , or are one of a limited number of seasonal workers allowed to come for up to six months a year but must then go home			0
from january , they will have free access to the labour market in @entity7 , like other @entity6 citizens			0
the influx is hardly surprising , given that @entity10 ’s minimum wage is 73p an hour and in @entity9 it is 79p , while in @entity7 it will rise to £ 6.31 for over- 21s later this year .			0
