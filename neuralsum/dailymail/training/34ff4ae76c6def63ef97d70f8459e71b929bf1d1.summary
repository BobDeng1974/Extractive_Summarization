by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 20:06 est , 10 april 2013 sobering numbers : @entity3 director - general @entity2 warned of a depression - era protectionism global trade almost stagnated last year and the world is at risk of a return to depression - era protectionism , a leading international watchdog warned yesterday			1
the @entity3 said trade between nations grew by just 2 per cent in 2012 – down from 5.2 per cent in 2011 and the second - worst figure since records began in 1981			1
the @entity17 - based body said trade would increase by 3.3 per cent this year instead of the 4.5 per cent it forecast in september			1
@entity3 director - general @entity2 described the figures as ‘ sobering ’			1
he said it was now more likely that countries would resort to putting up trade barriers in a futile attempt to protect their economies from outside competition			2
‘ the threat of protectionism may be greater now than at any time since the start of the crisis , since other policies to restore growth have been tried and found wanting , ’ said mr @entity2			2
a wave of protectionist measures such as trade barriers exacerbated the @entity38 in the 1930s and it is feared that a return to such policies would be a disaster for the global economy			0
the threat of a worldwide currency war , in which countries deliberately devalue their currencies to make exports more competitive and drive economic growth , could lead to governments putting up tariffs to protect their manufacturers			0
sir @entity53 , governor of the @entity54 , has warned that such measures could ‘ lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world ’ with every country suffering ‘ ruinous consequences ’			0
global trade has grown at an average rate of 5.3 per cent a year over the past two decades , according to the @entity3			1
but the two per cent rise in 2012 was the weakest increase since records began in 1981			0
the only worse performance was in 2009 during the depths of the @entity68 when trade fell			0
the @entity3 blamed the sharp slowdown on weak economic growth in developed countries and continued uncertainty over the future of the crisis - torn euro			1
‘ the events of 2012 should serve as a reminder that the structural flaws in economies that were revealed by the economic crisis have not been fully addressed , despite important progress in some areas , ’ said mr @entity2			0
‘ repairing these fissures needs to be the priority for 2013			0
’ risk : sir @entity53 has warned deliberately devaluing of currencies could ¿ lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world ' he went on : ‘ the final trade figures for 2012 are quite sobering , ’ sadding that 2013 would see ‘ more of the same ’			1
the @entity3 warned that a ‘ double speed ’ global economy was emerging with developing countries outperforming richer nations			1
it said : ‘ improved economic prospects for the @entity97 in 2013 should only partly offset the continued weakness in the @entity99 , whose economy is expected to remain flat or even contract slightly this year according to consensus estimates			0
‘ @entity104 ’s growth should continue to outpace other leading economies , cushioning the slowdown , but exports will still be constrained by weak demand in @entity109			0
’ but mr @entity2 said global trade would pick up next year with growth of five per cent			2
the 158 economies which make up the @entity3 set trade rules among themselves in an attempt to ensure a level playing field and spur growth by opening markets and removing trade barriers , including subsidies , excessive taxes and regulations			2
created in 1995 , the @entity3 launched its @entity123 round of talks in 2001 with the stated aim of underpinning development in poorer nations , but the talks have faltered .			2

trade between nations grew with a mere two per cent last year
