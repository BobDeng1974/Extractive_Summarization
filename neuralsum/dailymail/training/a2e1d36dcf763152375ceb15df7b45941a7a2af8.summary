it may sound like the plot from a desperate @entity3 reboot - but in reality it 's far more chilling			2
the @entity5 has developed a state - of - the - art underwater spying machine designed to look and act like a shark - so that it can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions undetected			1
the drone is five feet long , weighs almost 100lbs and can dive as deep as 300ft while gathering data			1
the @entity5 calls it the latest in a series of ' science - fiction - turned - reality ' projects to come out of its @entity28 experiments for developing unmanned biomimetic vehicles as an underwater fleet , @entity24 reports			1
the word biomimetic refers to human - made devices mimicking biology - in this case the ocean 's most feared predator			0
the autonomous drone is called @entity17 - and the @entity38 military hope it will boost the @entity5 's underwater capability			1
state - of - the - art : the @entity5 calls it the latest in a series of ' science - fiction - turned - reality ' projects to come out of its @entity28 experiments @entity44 , director of the @entity45 at @entity46 that designed @entity47 , said : ' it swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth			1
' @entity17 will allow the @entity5 to have success during more types of missions while keeping divers and sailors safe			2
' when it 's not hovering just below the surface of the water , the drone can dive to great depths while gathering data on tides , currents , wakes and weather conditions			0
the machine is able to operate without being controlled - but can also be connected to a laptop by a 500ft tether and be driven from on board a vessel			0
by doing this , any data collected can be transmitted in real time			0
it is believed the technology could also replace the bottlenose dolphins and @entity76 sea lions the @entity5 trains to recover equipment and spot underwater mines			0
breakthrough : the @entity38 military hope it will allow the @entity5 to carry out of a range of missions while keeping divers and sailors safe			0

state - of - the - art underwater drone has been *dubbed* the @entity17
five - foot long , 100lb device can dive to 300ft while transmitting data
@entity5 drone is latest in series of ' science - fiction - turned - reality ' projects
it was designed by @entity46 to help keep sailors out of *danger*
