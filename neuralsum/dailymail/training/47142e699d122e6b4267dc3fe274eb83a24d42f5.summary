when it comes to painting , artists around the globe are constantly looking for the next hit - and this one found it in his morning cuppa			2
these masterpieces are created using different blends of tea and coffee , painting life - like portraits set in cafe environments			1
@entity14 , 38 , began working with coffee and teas six years ago after taking inspiration from fabric dying using the hot drinks in @entity21 cultures			1
@entity22 : @entity23 , 38 , creates his life - like artwork using coffee and tea mr @entity14 's work is all inspired from the coffee house , as he believes both the scene and the colours coffee and tea create on a canvas work well together			1
each piece takes several painstaking months to complete , as @entity14 has to order in flavoured teas from around the world			1
by blending different coloured teas and coffee he is able to get the required colours and shades			2
@entity14 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ‘ i find coffee houses fascinating places - you have people gathered together in their own circles , all there for different reasons			1
perfect cuppa : each piece of art takes several months to complete as mr @entity52 experiments with flavoured teas and types of coffee from @entity56 to get the right shades new leaf : he began painting using coffee and tea six years ago and creates sceneries from cafe culture unusual art : by blending different types of teas and coffee he is able to get the required colours and shades to reflect real life true to life : mr @entity14 has painted a man enjoying a cup of coffee while he reads in a quiet cafe ‘ it was only natural that with the medium i was experimenting with i would find myself merging the two into one			1
i wanted to capture those moments in time at coffee houses where people get together			2
‘ there are three problems when painting in this medium that were figured out through trial and error ; it 's been very much an alchemical process			0
‘ the first problem is getting tea coffee stains to behave like paint			2
the second is keeping the vibrant colours of the teas from fading when exposed to sunlight - a problem eventually solved by mixing a uv stabilizer into the actual stain once it has been bound			0
‘ and finally it 's difficult to keep the colour from fading when it is exposed to oxygen			0
a polyacrylic is used after the painting is completed to seal it and protect it from oxidizing			0
@entity105 : @entity14 has tested his way through different blending methods to stop his art fading ‘ all of the colours , no matter which i was using , would turn into a brown when exposed to sunlight or oxygen			1
' the paintings were very monochromatic and all started to look the same before the issues were solved			0
‘ the hardest part is that all of the teas and coffees behave differently : teas do not mix very well together so a layered approach works best , so i use a variety of tools to get the result that i 'm after			0
‘ everything from q - tips , sponges , spoons , brushes and rags are used			0
i paint fairly large because the medium is very hard to control in smaller spaces			0
