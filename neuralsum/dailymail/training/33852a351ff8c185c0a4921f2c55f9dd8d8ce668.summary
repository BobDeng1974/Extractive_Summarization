by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 7 october 2013 more runways will have to be built in the @entity4 of @entity5 if the @entity2 is to avoid aviation gridlock , @entity2 ’s airports tsar said yesterday			2
sir @entity7 did not give a preferred option but the tone of his speech appeared to raise the odds of a highly controversial extra runway at @entity13			1
he did not even mention in his speech the so - called ‘ @entity15 ’ plans for a @entity17 airport championed by @entity19 mayor @entity18			2
sir @entity7 was detailing the provisional findings of his investigation into solving the problem of @entity2 ’s bursting airport capacity			1
he said simply expanding regional airports such as @entity26 and @entity27 would not provide a solution			1
big issue : more runways will have to be built in the south - east of @entity5 , including potentially at @entity13 ( pictured ) , @entity2 's airport tsar said today problem : sir @entity7 has said expanding regional airports such as @entity26 and @entity27 would not solve the problem of aviation capacity however , any recommendation of a third runway at @entity13 would trigger a huge political row			1
the conservatives are against it while @entity41 ’s policy is confused			2
offically , it is against major @entity13 expansion but shadow chancellor @entity44 said recently he would prefer a third runway over funding the @entity47 rail link			1
sir @entity7 said : ‘ our provisional conclusion is that we will need some net additional runway capacity in the @entity4 of @entity5 in the coming decades			1
’ he stressed that to rely ‘ only on runways currently in operation ’ would mean a poorer service for passengers and could damage the economy			2
sir @entity7 , who chairs the government ’s @entity56 , will deliver a short - list of options at the end of the year , followed by a single recommendation to ministers in 2015			1
he said the final recommendation could involve expansion at more than one airport – such as @entity13 and @entity66 or @entity67			1
despite failing to mention the ‘ @entity15 ’ options in his speech , he insisted afterwards that the @entity17 plans were still on the table			0
but he conceded that if it went ahead , the implication was that this would ‘ certainly involve the closure of @entity13 ’			1
new favourite idea : @entity18 has backed the four - runway ' @entity75 ' ( pictured ) in the @entity17 airport , which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the @entity79 in @entity80 elaborate plan : the @entity79 's proposed international railway station , which would include a service to @entity85 in 26 minutes @entity13 : @entity13 airport chiefs have published three options for a controversial new third runway to double passenger numbers and ‘ win the race ’ to be @entity92 ’s main international airline hub			1
but they also spelled out the prospect of fourth runway built after 2040			0
residents reacted with fury to the blueprint that would mean a sixth terminal @entity98 at @entity13 , and a seventh likely to follow , threatening action in the @entity100 to halt it			2
each of the three third - runway @entity13 options will boost annual flights from 480,000 to 740,000 a year – more in keeping with its international rivals - doubling passenger numbers from 70million to 130million a year			2
' @entity108 ' : the inner estuary site on @entity80 's @entity79 is close enough to @entity19 to provide smooth and fast access by public transport , yet ideally located so as to allow take - off and landing over water and so impact on as small a population as possible			0
' @entity15 ' : an airport on an artificial island off the @entity80 coast would remove all problems of noise pollution and give the airport the freedom to operate in whatever way it needed in order to maximise the @entity2 ’s connectivity and economic benefits			0
stansted expansion : developing a major four - runway airport at @entity67 would have the attraction of building on existing infrastructure and being sited in a relatively sparsely populated region			0
@entity66 expansion : rival @entity66 has unveiled its own controversial plans for a £ 9billion second runway at @entity66 that could treble passenger numbers to nearly 90million a year			2
but it too has flown into turbulence from residents and environmental groups			0
@entity66 bosses said a new runway in @entity143 , positioned to the south of the current site , could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at @entity13			1
it would be part of a ‘ constellation ’ of three main airports around @entity19 – instead of one major @entity13 ‘ hub ’			2
sir @entity7 said : ‘ it is obvious that options for @entity13 are on the table			1
i do n’t think that makes other options un-lookable at			0
’ but he added : ‘ you also have to look at how the airline market would develop if you did n’t expand @entity13			2
’ sir @entity7 held back for now on ruling on his ‘ preferred option ’ for @entity4 airport expansion			1
fighting to win his support are plans for a third and even a fourth runway at @entity13 , a brand new ‘ @entity15 ’ in the @entity17 – the two competing and opposing ‘ hub ’ airport options - and extra runways at @entity66 and @entity67			1
sir @entity7 , who chairs the government ’s @entity56 which will recommend to ministers where new runways should be built was giving his ‘ emerging thinking ’ in a speech after taking evidence from interested parties over the @entity177			1
he added that in environmental terms it ‘ would also almost certainly not be the best solution in terms of minimising the overall carbon impact of flights and travel to and from airports ’			0
sir @entity7 said pressure on the @entity2 ’s busiest airports is likely to continue to grow ‘ even if we take a more conservative view of future aviation demand than the @entity190 has in the past			1
’ this will lead to overcrowding at airports in the south east of @entity5 specifically			0
more importantly , this aviation gridlock will happen even if demand for flights is less than expected because of pressures from the government ’s legally enforced ‘ green ’ climate change objectives			0
sir @entity7 said it was difficult to see how the market alone could resolve the ‘ imbalance ’ between demand and capacity in the @entity4 of @entity5			1
and simply sending for flights to the regions would not be enough : ‘ regional airports are already serving their local markets effectively but it is difficult to see how they can absorb all the excess demand			0
the tools available to @entity199 to influence the location of flights are also very limited			0
’ so taken together the taken together he concluded that such consideration ‘ point to the need for new runway infrastructure in the south east of @entity5 in the coming decades ’			0
he added : ‘ a mechanism for managing the carbon impacts of aviation will be needed if the @entity2 is to achieve its statutory carbon targets – just as it will in other countries			0
this is the case whether new runway capacity is provided in the @entity4 or not			0
’ he added : ‘ i would be interested in comments on the analysis i have set out today			0
’ the @entity56 is seeking responses on the emerging thinking and analysis set out in the speech by october 31			0
the @entity56 was launched in november last year but its final recommendations will not be implemented – if at all – until after the next general election .			0

sir @entity7 says expanding @entity27 and @entity26 not option
boosts chances of new runways at @entity13 , @entity66 or an @entity238
