by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 21 february 2013 bioengineers have used 3d printing to achieve a breakthrough in prosthesis by creating the first artificial ears that look and act like real ones			0
a new study by researchers at @entity9 , @entity10 , shows how prosthetic ears almost indistinguishable from natural ones can be @entity13 printed using gels made of living cells			1
not only that , but over a three - month period these flexible , artificial ears grew even their own cartilage to replace the collagen used to mould them			1
new hope : professor @entity21 and colleagues collaborated with @entity24 physicians to create an artificial ear using 3d printing and injectable molds ' this is such a win - win for both medicine and basic science , demonstrating what we can achieve when we work together , ' said study author @entity21 , associate professor of biomedical engineering			1
the novel ear may be the solution surgeons have long wished for to help children born with ear deformity , said co-author dr @entity39 , professor of plastic surgery at @entity24			1
' a bioengineered ear replacement like this would also help individuals who have lost part or all of their external ear in an accident or from cancer , ' he said			1
currently , replacement ears are usually constructed with materials that have an unnatural @entity51 - like consistency alternatively surgeons may sometimes build ears from a patient 's harvested rib , but this option is challenging and painful for children , and the ears rarely look natural or perform well , said dr @entity39			0
breakthrough : a 3d printer in @entity63 deposits cells encapsulated in a hydrogel that will develop into new ear tissue			1
the printer takes instructions from a file built from 3d scans of real human ears to make the ears , professor @entity21 and colleagues started with a digitised @entity13 image of a human subject 's ear			1
they then used a 3d printer to assemble a mould based on the scan and poured in their ' living ' collagen gel			1
a bionic hand which allows the recipient to feel ‘ lifelike ’ sensations is to be transplanted on to a patient ’s arm for the first time			0
until now , artificial limbs have been able to pick up brain signals destined for the absent hand and translate them into movements , but they could not give sensory feedback			0
the new hand , which is attached directly to the nervous system via electrodes clipped on to two of the arm ’s main nerves , aims to restore a sense of touch in amputees			0
the electrodes will allow the recipient to control the hand using just their thoughts – and will also send signals back to the brain			0
scientists hope the breakthrough will pave the way for a new generation of artificial limbs that more closely imitate real body parts by providing feeling and increased dexterity			2
this @entity9 - developed , high - density gel is similar to the consistency of jelly when the mould is removed			0
the collagen serves as a scaffold upon which cartilage could grow			1
the process is also fast , professor @entity21 added			0
' it takes half a day to design the mould , a day or so to print it , 30 minutes to inject the gel , and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later , ' he said			2
' we trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted			1
' the new process offers hope to thousands of children born with a congenital deformity called microtia			1
the incidence of microtia , which is when the external ear is not fully developed , varies from almost 1 to more than 4 per 10,000 births each year			2
many children born with microtia have an intact inner ear , but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure			2
dr @entity39 and professor @entity21 have been collaborating on bioengineered human replacement parts since 2007			0
professor @entity21 has also worked with @entity9 neurological surgeon dr @entity150 on bioengineered disc replacements using some of the same techniques			0
the researchers specifically work on replacement human structures that are primarily made of cartilage – joints , trachea , spine , nose – because cartilage does not need to be vascularized with a blood supply in order to survive			1
' using human cells , specifically those from the same patient , would reduce any possibility of rejection , ' dr @entity39 said			2
he added that the best time to implant a bioengineered ear on a child would be when they are about five or six years old			2
at that age , ears are 80 per cent of their adult size			0
if all safety and efficacy trials prove successful , it might be possible to try the first human implant of a @entity9 bioengineered ear in as little as three years , dr @entity39 said .			0

the prosthetics are @entity13 printed using gels made of living cells
after they are implanted they even begin to grow their own cartilage
it could offer hope to thousands with congenital ear deformities
