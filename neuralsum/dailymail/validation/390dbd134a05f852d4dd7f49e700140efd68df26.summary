buoyant : @entity0 on a visit to a building site in @entity3 yesterday families will be better off this year than they were when the @entity6 came to power , independent experts said yesterday			1
in a boost to @entity0 , the @entity9 said it was ‘ very likely ’ that household incomes would be higher this year than in 2010			1
the chancellor ’s claim that families would be £ 900 better off in 2015 was one of the key @entity17 messages in @entity18			1
the @entity9 also raised serious questions about @entity21 ’s much - repeated counter-claim that families are £ 1,600 worse off than they were in 2010			1
in its annual post-budget briefing yesterday , it suggested the @entity30 ’s figure was out of date and failed to take account of rising pensioner incomes , surging employment or changes to the tax and benefit system			1
the think - tank ’s verdict potentially deals a fatal blow to mr @entity21 ’s claims of a cost of living ‘ crisis ’			1
in a further blow , the @entity9 said inequality in @entity42 had fallen under the @entity6			0
it also said @entity30 ’s plans were so lax that mr @entity21 might borrow up to £ 25billion a year more than the @entity44 – piling up @entity42 ’s £ 1.5trillion national debt indefinitely			1
but it did warn that the impact of coalition cuts had fallen most heavily on the poor , as a result of reductions in benefits			0
mr @entity0 seized on the @entity9 verdict last night as evidence that the government ’s plans are starting to deliver higher living standards for families despite the years of austerity needed to deal with the huge budget deficit left by @entity30			1
the chancellor said : ‘ this is a very significant moment for our economic debate : on the day after the @entity63 , the independent @entity9 have confirmed the @entity64 forecast that living standards are set to be higher in 2015 than in 2010			1
‘ this is more evidence that our plan is delivering for @entity42 ’s families , and it demolishes @entity21 ’s central claim in this election			1
i ’m the first to say that the job of repairing our economy is n’t done , because the @entity42 people are still paying a huge price for @entity30 ’s great recession , but @entity42 is on the right track and we must not turn back			2
’ the debate over living standards provoked a furious row between @entity30 and the @entity17 during @entity18			2
the @entity9 said @entity30 ’s claim was based on figures from the @entity83 , covering the period 2010 - 2014			1
economist @entity84 said it was true that these figures show average earnings fell during this period			0
but he said more recent data showed earnings are now ‘ growing ’			0
and he warned the @entity30 statistics give only a partial view of total household income			1
the figures do not include pensions , which have received a substantial boost			0
because they are gross figures they also do not include the impact of tax changes			0
and they do not reflect that fact that employment is up by almost two million – meaning many people who previously had no income are now earning			0
mr @entity84 said : ‘ it is reasonable to think that real average incomes will surpass pre-crisis levels in 2015			2
’ the chancellor ’s claim that families would be £ 900 better off in 2015 was one of the key @entity17 messages in wednesday ’s budget he did not directly endorse mr @entity0 ’s £ 900 figure , but said it was based on a ‘ quite reasonable measure of living standards ’			1
he said the @entity9 ’s own forecasts also suggest a significant rise in living standards this year			0
the @entity9 ruling was not all good news for mr @entity0			2
it said there was ‘ no cause for celebration ’ as @entity42 has suffered ‘ by far the slowest recovery in modern history ’			0
@entity9 director @entity126 said that real incomes were ‘ very likely ’ to be higher this year than in 2010			1
but he added : ‘ we are , for sure , worse off than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 , or indeed back in 2010			2
’ the @entity9 also assessed mr @entity21 ’s claim that the @entity6 has produced a ‘ recovery for the few ’			1
mr @entity126 said research showed that ‘ across the huge majority of the population , inequality has fallen since 2010 ’			2
the total burden of austerity since the start of the recession has fallen most heavily on the top 10 per cent of earners			0
but , if @entity30 raids on the rich before 2010 are stripped out , it is the poorest 10 per cent who have lost the biggest proportion of their income , because of cuts to benefits			1
those in the middle have been left ‘ remarkably unaffected , ’ mr @entity126 said			0
shadow chancellor @entity153 said the findings were a ‘ damning verdict ’ on the government			0
@entity21 claimed that families are £ 1,600 a year worse off compared to 2010 in the aftermath of @entity18 , the @entity44 and @entity30 have clashed bitterly over what will be a key @entity161 battleground : are households better off now than in 2010 ? here , the @entity163 sorts the claim from the reality ... what @entity21 says : in his @entity63 reply , the @entity30 leader repeated his claim – made ad nauseam in recent years – that : ‘ this chancellor has failed the working families of @entity42			1
people are £ 1,600 a year worse off			1
’ reality : the figure – the foundation of @entity30 ’s ‘ cost - of - living crisis ’ – is based solely on gross earnings , not net incomes			1
this means it takes no account of any benefits a family receive or , crucially , the @entity6 ’s decision to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £ 10,600			2
to reach the figure of £ 1,600 , @entity30 compares a person ’s gross income with the @entity192 measure of inflation , which is discredited and has been replaced in the national accounts by the @entity195 , which produces a significantly lower annual rate			1
also , @entity30 ’s calculation runs only to april 2014			2
since then , wages have begun to rise significantly while the @entity195 inflation rate has fallen to just 0.3 per cent			0
what @entity0 says : on wednesday , the chancellor declared : ‘ the facts show households on average will be around £ 900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis any more			1
’ reality : @entity153 immediately rubbished the figure , which is based on a measure called @entity213 per capita , on the grounds that it also includes income received by churches , trades unions and charities			2
the @entity219 includes these organisations in the calculation – which compares all financial incomings with outgoings – because they ‘ are financed by households and their sole purpose is to serve households ’			2
@entity153 rubbished @entity0 's suggestion that families are £ 900 better off than they were in 2010 however , a recent @entity219 research paper found that if they were removed from the figures , the measure would have delivered a marginally more positive result for ordinary households and mr @entity0 – not less so , as mr @entity153 implied			1
the figures the chancellor used are based on forecasts by the independent @entity64 up to the end of 2015			0
the @entity64 said disposable incomes will grow by 3.1 per cent this year , the fastest since 2001			0
verdict : the hammer was brought down in favour of mr @entity0 by the hugely respected @entity9 , which said average household incomes ‘ are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 ’			1
it added that they could also be higher than their previous peak in 2009			0
@entity30 will point to the qualifying remark by the @entity9 that this ‘ still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history			1
having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration ’			1
but the verdict is still a bitter blow to the two eds – whose ‘ cost of living ’ fox has now been shot			0
last year , mr @entity153 said the issue that will be centre stage in the election was the same question posed by @entity264 in his first presidential campaign in 1980 : ‘ are you better off than you were four years ago ? ’ in the @entity267 , the answer back then was no – and it cost @entity268 the @entity269			0
the @entity44 will hope a @entity270 – albeit a qualified one – will similarly be enough to keep @entity30 out of @entity271			2
wannabe chancellor : @entity153 still relies on his mother - in - law for help with maths he wants to be chancellor of the exchequer			0
but @entity153 still relies on his mother - in - law for help with maths			0
during an interview on @entity279 yesterday , @entity30 ’s shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on tv			1
it came as he struggled to respond to @entity0 ’s @entity63 and admitted he would not reverse any of the measures announced – including the new help to buy isas			2
mr @entity153 appeared on the @entity286 show in a bid to lead @entity30 ’s post-budget fightback			2
at the end of his interview a tired - looking mr @entity153 expressed relief he had not been asked any tricky arithmetic questions			2
he told host @entity294 : ‘ i was pleased you did n’t ask me any maths questions this morning			0
’ asked how he was with fractions , mr @entity153 replied : ‘ luckily my mother - in - law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths			0
’ a shocked miss @entity294 interrupted : ‘ you can not tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on his mother - in - law to do his maths			0
’ mr @entity153 said : ‘ the kids think the mother - in - law is very good at maths teaching			0
you always rely on your mother - in - law			0
’ later , on @entity310 ’s today programme , mr @entity153 admitted it was ‘ good ’ that mr @entity0 announced help for savers with the £ 1,000 tax - free savings allowance			1
he also said the help to buy @entity315 was an ‘ interesting idea ’ that would not be scrapped if @entity30 wins in may and that he would keep the rise in the personal tax allowance – to go up from £ 10,600 to £ 11,000 by 2017 - 18			1
asked if there was anything from @entity18 he would reverse , mr @entity153 said : ‘ i thought it was quite empty			0
i do n’t think there was too much in it			0
there ’s nothing i ’m saying to you from yesterday that i need to reverse			0
what i will reverse is the plan for deeper spending cuts in the next three years than the last five			0

' very likely ' household incomes will be higher than in 2010 , experts say
@entity0 's claim that families will be £ 900 better off was key budget pledge
financial experts also raised questions about @entity21 's counter-claims
@entity30 leader said families are are £ 1,600 worse off than they were in 2010
but a think - tank said @entity21 's figure was out of date and not correct
