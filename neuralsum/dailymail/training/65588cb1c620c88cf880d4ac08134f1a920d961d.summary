so , now @entity1 ’s best young players know what the international game is all about			1
and after a match gripped by tension in @entity7 , an even bigger test awaits them in @entity8			0
under 21 football aims to prepare footballers for elite competition and if @entity1 are to reach @entity12 2015 , they must pass the sternest of examinations			1
fortunately for @entity17 , his squad seem to be learning quickly			2
this could have been a night when their dreams of reaching next summer ’s finals in the @entity22 perished , but thanks to a show of character and quality , @entity1 turned a 1 - 0 deficit into a 2 - 1 first - leg lead thanks to a header from @entity30 and a late penalty from @entity32			1
the away goal @entity8 pilfered here through @entity78 means they are far from out of this absorbing contest			2
having breezed through the group stage , rattling up eight straight wins and scoring goals almost at will , @entity1 were always going to find this contest a significant step up			1
@entity8 arrived with a blemish - free away record in qualifying and they caused trouble right away , so much so that in the 13th minute @entity17 ’s side fell behind for the first time in a game since september last year			1
it was a cheap goal , too , as an inswinging corner was glanced on by @entity68 to @entity78 , who headed past @entity114 from six yards			2
this posed a test of @entity1 ’s character but their response was spirited			2
@entity54 was heavily involved and he came closest to restoring parity before half - time when he danced between two opponents before cracking a drive against a post			2
@entity59 also threatened , while @entity52 should have done better			0
@entity8 still exuded menace on the break			0
each time @entity1 were caught upfield , blue shirts swept forward , intent on inflicting a killer blow			0
there was one lucky escape in the 36th minute when @entity75 fired wide with the goal at his mercy but @entity1 , who were watched by a host of the @entity136 ’s top brass including chairman @entity137 and head coach @entity138 , were able to get to half - time and regroup			0
@entity17 ’s words clearly had an effect as @entity1 began the second period with greater purpose			1
their passing had more zip and they began asking questions of @entity8 , trying to stretch the play and get behind the visiting defence whenever they could			0
@entity30 's equaliser brought @entity1 level just before the hour mark at @entity153 in the @entity12 playoff first - leg against @entity8 @entity30 spreads his arms wide in celebration after scoring the equaliser for @entity37 at @entity153 on friday night @entity158 defender @entity54 ( left ) celebrates with @entity30 after the latter scores for @entity37 against @entity39 soon they got their reward			1
after conceding a corner , @entity8 failed to clear their lines and the ball arrived at the feet of @entity32			0
up to that point , the @entity167 forward had been quiet but he found a yard to put in an inviting cross and @entity30 did the rest , stooping to head in at the near post			1
@entity30 has made impressive strides in the last 12 months — it was a year to the day since he scored a hat - trick in a 4 - 0 rout of @entity178 — and he has now found the net in each of his last three @entity1 appearances			1
his intervention could not have been better timed as it lifted the home crowd and gave @entity1 the impetus to chase victory			0
they got their rewards in the 85th minute when @entity32 was upended by keeper @entity45			0
@entity32 kept his nerve , thumping home from 12 yards			0
the question is whether @entity1 can finish the job in the @entity190			0
@entity32 ( right ) and @entity59 ( left ) celebrate after the former scores from the penalty spot late on in the match @entity194 ( third right ) loses @entity1 and @entity158 defender @entity54 to head @entity8 ahead in the 12th minute @entity1 's @entity30 ( left ) , @entity55 ( centre ) and @entity198 ( right ) look dejected as they prepare to restart after @entity8 's goal @entity59 watches on as his shot flies towards the @entity8 goal during @entity1 's 2 - 1 win at @entity153 , @entity7 @entity57 ( right ) , who plays his club football for @entity204 , breaks free from the challenge of @entity78 ( left ) @entity30 jumps over @entity8 goalkeeper @entity45 during the first half at @entity153 , as he tried to draw @entity1 level @entity208 and @entity37 midfielder @entity55 ( right ) battles with @entity8 's @entity210 ( left ) during the two side 's playoff first - leg match @entity30 , of @entity214 , argues with referee @entity88 during the first half at @entity153 on friday evening the @entity37 squad pose for a squad photo before the match against @entity219 on friday night			1

@entity17 's @entity37 side are looking to qualify for their fifth major *tournament* finals
@entity37 had registered nine wins and one draw from their 10 @entity226 matches prior to friday 's match
it was a *disastrous* start as @entity78 broke away from @entity54 to put @entity219 ahead after 13 minutes
@entity30 levelled the scores as the match approached the hour mark after heading in @entity32 's cross
@entity32 completed @entity1 's *comeback* when he dispatched a penalty late on in the game
