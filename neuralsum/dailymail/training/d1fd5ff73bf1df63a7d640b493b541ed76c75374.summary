by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:18 est , 18 november 2013 a woman was diagnosed with a serious heart condition after her neck started pulsating violently			1
the 33 - year - old @entity8 woman ’s abnormal pulse alerted doctors to the fact she had a condition caused by a faulty heart valve she was diagnosed with the heart condition tricuspid regurgitation			1
tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart 's tricuspid valve does not close properly , meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts			1
the valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber			2
when it is faulty the pressure in the blood vessels can change			1
this can lead to the abnormal pulses seen in the @entity8 patient ’s neck , @entity27 reports			1
the condition is usually caused by the enlargement of the right ventricle but can also develop if the valve is damaged by an infection			2
a 33 - year - old @entity8 woman 's neck started to pulsate as a result of a heart condition			1
she had a damaged heart valve which caused her abnormal pulse but she recovered after surgery to replace the valve in this patient ’s case , she had previously had @entity46			1
the unnamed woman ’s case was described in the @entity49			0
she required an operation to replace her damaged tricuspid valve and has since made a full recovery			1
the case was reported by researchers at the @entity55 , in @entity8			0
tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart 's tricuspid valve does not close properly meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts			2
the valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber			0
the most common cause of tricuspid regurgitation is the enlargement of the right ventricle which pumps blood to the lungs			0
the condition can also develop if the valve is damaged by a bacterial infection			0
symptoms include pulsing neck veins , fatigue , swelling of the abdomen and weakness			0
if the condition is not causing many symptoms , no treatment is necessarily required			0
in more severe cases , surgery is required to repair or replace the valve			2
people with severe cases of tricuspid regurgitation have a poor prognosis if it can not be corrected			0

the unnamed 33 - year - old @entity8 woman had a damaged heart valve as a result of developing @entity46 - the damaged valve caused an abnormal pulse
this made the blood vessels in her neck throb *dramatically*
had to have surgery to replace the damaged valve and has now recovered
