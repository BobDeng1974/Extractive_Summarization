by @entity0 and @entity1 with their private jets , luxury holidays and wardrobes full of designer labels , the @entity3 lifestyle is an enviable one to say the least			1
but while the glitzy lives of footballers ' nearest and dearest look fabulous from the outside , an explosive new book reveals that all is n't quite as it seems			2
in @entity3 , the anonymous wife of an @entity17 international tells of her life in the @entity20 fast lane - and the road blocks that come with it			1
not , as she 's at pains to point out , that everything is bad			0
' what i always say is that my children have really benefited , ' the @entity3 revealed in an exclusive interview with @entity45			2
' they are really privileged and we remind them every day how lucky they are			0
i have travelled a lot and have been lucky enough to see some amazing places - and it 's all because of his wages			2
' but while she enjoys a £ 7,000 monthly allowance and lives a jet set lifestyle , the @entity3 also tells of having to endure girls throwing themselves at her husband , putting her own career ambitions on hold and having to be prepared to relocate at the drop of a hat			1
' we were once in this bar together and this girl was really intoxicated and she was just throwing herself at [ my husband ] and she had her arm round his waist , ' recalls the @entity3			1
glamorous : @entity69 ( left ) and @entity70 and @entity71 ( right ) supporting her man : @entity74 's fiancee @entity73 cheers her man on during the 2010 @entity75 ' i was stood right next to him and that 's when i find it disrespectful			0
when they are really good looking it does make you feel insecure			0
' luckily , her husband , who was once caught out in a tabloid kiss and tell - a story that the @entity3 says was n't true - has developed a strategy for seeing them off			1
' he has his own way of being polite but firm and he wo n't play up to the girls , ' she explains			2
' he lets them know when they 've crossed the line			0
' nevertheless , she says the constant gaggle of girls that surround her husband , understandably , do make her nervous			2
' i would be a fool to trust him 100 per cent , ' she admits			1
' footballers do n't have a great reputation with all the cheating that 's reported in the papers			2
' there are always going to be doubts in my mind			0
but i do n't think he 's cheating , i ’m 100 per cent about that			1
' scandalous : although now with @entity110 , @entity109 has been on the end of tabloid sex scandals in the past ready for action : @entity17 training at the @entity115 in @entity116 ahead of their opening game on saturday while girls in nightclubs and paps lurking about outside the door are downsides of the @entity3 way of life , upsides include glamorous holidays as well as the chance to accompany their men on international tours			1
' i do enjoy being away on tour , ' admits the @entity3 , who grew up in a football - loving middle class family and loved going to matches with her father as a child			1
' there is a real buzz when the stadium is packed and it ’s very exciting			0
i do enjoy football , i love watching @entity17 and i 'm really looking forward to the @entity75			0
' but , ' she adds , ' it does dictate my life and my husband ’s			2
we are n't always living where we want to live and he has ended up missing birthdays and christenings and @entity151			0
' there 's also the issue of sex before a game which , according to the @entity3 , really is banned in the hours leading up to a big match			1
' there is this unwritten rule of no sex before the game , ' she laughs			0
' i do n't know who said it - probably a woman who 's not very horny			1
leading the pack : @entity167 's @entity166 ( left ) is in @entity168 as is @entity170 's wife @entity171 ( right ) i am @entity172 : the @entity173 as an @entity174 , £ 7.99 , is published by @entity175 and is out on 19th june ' i think you ’re fine the night before , although maybe not just before the game			1
you might wear him out but that depends on his performance , i suppose			0
' more troublesome are the other wags , who , as the secret @entity3 reveals in her book , can be a daunting bunch to begin with			1
nevertheless , she says she resents the @entity3 stereotype and adds that many have careers and charity work that they 're rarely credited for			1
' there are a few who do conform , who get great satisfaction from getting a new car or a designer handbag and who are really materialistic , ' she explains			0
' but there are a lot who are n't like that who are tarnished with the same brush			0
i know a lot of lovely @entity205 who are mothers who will go to the playground with their kids and are n't all about the glitz and glamour			0
' wags are never recognised for the good they do only the bad - a lot of us are involved in charity work and i really try to get involved as much as possible			1
' with the @entity75 kicking off in @entity168 , she 's unlikely to have much spare time for charity work over the next month , although she is looking forward to seeing how the world responds to her warts and all memoir			1
' i wanted to share the reality of being a @entity3 , ' she explains			2
' it 's my story and it goes way back over the years , from my upbringing to how i 've progressed			0
it definitely is n't all glitz and glamour ! ' i am @entity172 : the @entity173 as an @entity174 , £ 7.99 , is published by @entity175 and is out on 19th june			0

the @entity3 , a tell - all memoir , lifts the lid on life as a footballer 's wife
anonymous *author* says that although much is good , there are downsides
reveals what being caught in a tabloid sex scandal is really like
also says she ca n't trust husband 100 per cent because of all the girls
