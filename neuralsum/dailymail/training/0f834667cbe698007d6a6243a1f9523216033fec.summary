contrite : ( left to right ) @entity36 , head of @entity37 , @entity39 ceo @entity38 and @entity40 ceo @entity42 bow to make a joint public apology about the scam scam : the data security breach affected around 15million cardholders the biggest breach of personal privacy ever in @entity5 has further highlighted the vulnerability of credit card information after tens of millions of @entity54 cardholders ' details were stolen from retailer @entity55 during the holiday shopping season			1
@entity5 on average have more than four credit cards , something that has contributed to one of the highest levels of personal debt relative to the size of the economy in the developed world			1
the data security breach affected around 15million cardholders , according to official estimates , by far the largest in a series of such scams against financial firms in @entity5 going back to 2011			1
president @entity8 is said to be one of the millions of victims of the scam some previous attacks involved hackers believed to originate from @entity15 , but this one seems to have been an inside job			1
financial regulators said a contractor with the @entity80 , a private firm that manages the credit information of millions of @entity15 for financial services providers , simply loaded details of 105.8million accounts held by @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity37 onto a portable hard drive			1
the technician was allegedly working on forgery - proofing credit cards when he committed the theft in february , june and december last year , according to regulator @entity91 ( @entity91 ) , citing the prosecutor 's office leading the investigation			1
accused : the data thief was reportedly working for the @entity80 ( file picture ) the man then sold the information to at least two people including a loan marketer and a broker , the @entity91 said			2

the stolen information included names , home addresses , and phone numbers , bank account numbers , credit card details , identification numbers , income , marriage and passport numbers			1
the @entity91 said credit card passwords were not stolen , although this was cold comfort to @entity5 for whom most credit card transactions simply require a card swipe and signature - without the need for a chip and pin process			1

nearly half the losses occurred in the @entity54 , helped by the lack of the more advanced card readers .			0
