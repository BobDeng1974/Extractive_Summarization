defender @entity0 insists @entity1 have still not given up hope of a late charge into the @entity5 play - offs and the prospect of an @entity8 semi-final place will not distract them from that aim			1
sunday 's goalless draw at @entity11 to earn a replay back at @entity13 - where they have already dispatched @entity16 sides @entity15 and @entity17 - may have improved their chances of booking a trip to @entity21			1
however , they are likely to have at least five league matches to play before the expected return leg against the @entity25 in early april and , even though @entity1 are 14 points adrift of the play - offs , @entity0 stressed they have to give it one last push			1
@entity0 ( right ) says him and his @entity1 team mates are only thinking about gaining a play off place ' we do n't really think about the @entity8 , ' he told @entity32			1
' we try to give 100 per cent every game as there is still a chance of getting into the play - offs but we have to concentrate in the last 11 games of the league			1
' we have a big game at home to @entity41 which we will take on when it gets closer but going to @entity11 , with them on form and being a strong team , will give us a boost			2
' the full back had a busy game trying to deal with the skill of @entity41 's @entity50 in the @entity8 clash rovers matched what fellow @entity5 sides @entity55 ( in the @entity56 ) and @entity57 ( @entity8 ) have done this season in not getting beat in 90 minutes at @entity11			1
they enjoyed the better of the play before the interval and - but for a brilliant save from @entity62 - could have won the match with @entity65 's header early in the second half			2
that has given them hope they can claim another @entity16 scalp at home in a few weeks ' time			0
' i think playing at @entity11 we did well and at least deserved another chance at home , ' @entity0 added			2
@entity65 ( 15 ) sees his close range header tipped over the bar brilliantly by @entity62 ' we had two big chances to score , one of which the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from , but we play at home now and we are strong there			0
' we thought we could come here and shake them up a bit			0
we did very well as a team , defending all over the pitch with the midfielder 's and ( striker ) @entity89 as well			0
' we did n't give them too many chances to create in 90 minutes and it was a good day			0
' @entity89 ( top scorer this season with 14 goals ) on his day will give any defender a hard time as he is good in the air and hopefully next game he will score against them			0
' @entity89 ( left ) was a constant threat to @entity103 ' side as they struggled to deal with his strength			0

@entity0 admitted that @entity1 are n't thinking about the @entity8
rovers held @entity41 to a 0 - 0 at @entity11 and are a win away from @entity21
@entity0 is still hopeful his side can earn a @entity5 play - off place
