they spend their days travelling along @entity2 's country lanes and their nights in traditional gypsy wagons , moving from campsite to grassy verge as the mood takes them			0
but these are not the gypsies of the sort made famous by @entity12			0
instead , these are the @entity15 's @entity14 , a peaceful hippyish community devoted to the principles of @entity14 belief , which include spiritual healing and a holistic view of the cosmos			0
often hard to find , thanks in no small part to their constant travels , the people of the @entity14 community are the subject of a spectacular series of photographs by @entity15 snapper , @entity30 , who spent months living with a community based in the @entity33			2
low key : @entity14 live a quiet life , roaming the roads of @entity15 in their elaborately decorated horse - drawn wagons travels : the majority of @entity14 are to be found in the @entity33 , in particular @entity41 and @entity42 back to nature : @entity14 live a simple life , producing their own food and living hand - in - glove with nature @entity30 , who has since produced a book on his experiences with the @entity50 , has captured a snapshot of their simple life , which sees them spend the majority of their time either on the road or setting up camp in some of the loveliest parts of the @entity2 countryside			1
unrelated to the @entity61 or @entity62 travellers , the @entity14 movement began in 1986 when a group of post-punk @entity65 protesters headed out of @entity66 into the @entity2 countryside			1
over the years , the movement has evolved into what @entity30 describes as ' a hybrid tribe of new gypsies ' and ' present - day rural anarchists ' , who , along with flitting about the countryside , regularly appear at festivals , among them @entity74			0
indeed , the earliest years of the ' @entity75 ' , as they 're also known , were characterised by mass attendance at festivals such as @entity78 and the @entity79 , although another , the @entity80 , proved considerably more controversial			0
no relation : @entity14 like those featured in @entity30 's book are no relation to either @entity61 gypsies or @entity62 travellers community : @entity90 movement began in 1986 when a group of @entity65 post-punk protesters moved to the country freedom : the movement grew out of festivals such as the @entity79 of the 1970s and many still attend @entity74 simple : the majority of @entity14 eschew modern creature comforts , although that did n't stop @entity101 from visiting held in 1992 in @entity42 , the week - long unlicensed festival attracted an estimated 40,000 ravers but led to the government taking action on ' illegal ' festivals after the event made headlines across the @entity15			1
despite the banning of unlicensed festivals , life for @entity14 remains largely unchanged , with @entity30 's ' new gypsies ' sharing a desire for sustainability , a love of self - reliance , and a disdain for the trappings of contemporary life			2
although the @entity14 are n't immune from the lures of the modern world - among @entity30 's photos is a snap of @entity101 enjoying a dose of gypsy life - for most , an existence that eschews traditional creature comforts for the simplicity of life on the road remains the ultimate goal			1
free spirit : @entity30 describes the travellers variously as ' a hybrid tribe of new gypsies ' and ' present - day rural anarchists ' romantic : a @entity14 wagon sits alone in a @entity42 field in one of @entity30 's striking photographs homely : @entity90 wagons are usually elaborately decorated and also house the family pets , whether dog or duck			2

@entity14 first appeared in 1986 when a group of post-punk @entity65 activists left @entity66
they *decamped* to the @entity33 for a simple , self - sustaining life on the road with their families
photos are the work of @entity30 who has spent decades snapping @entity14 in the @entity33
the @entity158 by @entity159 , *Â£* *22.50* , is *published* by @entity160
