@entity0 began the new @entity2 season in stunning fashion with a crushing qualifying performance to grab the fourth pole position of his career for the @entity8 @entity7			1
it is clear that after a dominant 2014 from @entity11 they will again be the team to beat in 2015 as reigning champion @entity0 blasted his way to top spot on the grid at @entity17 's @entity16 , putting even team - mate @entity18 in the shade			1
@entity0 finished with a lap of one minute 26.327secs , a staggering 0.6secs clear of @entity18 as @entity11 locked out the front row , with @entity23 ' @entity22 the best of the rest , but 1.4secs down on the 30 - year - old @entity25			1

@entity18 @entity30 @entity31 5 @entity32 6 @entity33 @entity34 @entity35 9 @entity36 @entity37 @entity18 crosses the line , but it is only good enough for @entity40 , a mighty half - a - second down on @entity41			1
he had an awful first sector , but was quicker than @entity0 in the final sector			1
@entity33 wobbles out of the final corner , but he still does enough to qualify fourth and @entity0 is going even quicker ... @entity0 complaining about his tyres on his out - lap from the pit - lane ... will it make a difference ? @entity34 is the first driver on a timed lap. he crosses the line to clock a 1:28.329 to move him up to third , but here comes @entity54 and he goes third above @entity34			1
right , here we go for the final runs of the afternoon			0
can anyone beat @entity0 to @entity8 @entity7 pole ? all of the drivers are back in their respective garages and it is @entity0 from @entity31 , @entity22 , @entity32 , @entity37 , @entity34 , @entity36 and @entity35			1
neither @entity18 nor @entity33 have posted a time			1
@entity0 crosses the line and the @entity25 posts a 1.26:419 which is 1.3 seconds quicker than the next driver in @entity31 , but @entity18 runs @entity65 at the penultimate corner and takes a trip across the grass			1
he aborts his lap and dives into the pit - lane			0
the @entity71 will now have just one shot at pole			0
@entity33 complaining about his brakes during a sloppy lap for the @entity76 which has seen him slide all over the track in his @entity23			2

we want to be out on the track			0
the cars are ready to go but there are a few gremlins which are keeping us back			0
i want to be out there as much as anything			0
coming from @entity99 last year i know what a race meeting is like			0
i am heading back to the @entity102 , but i know the team are heading out early to @entity104 so we will be in better shape than we are now			0
there are a few issues with the software which means we ca n’t get out there			0
17 - year - old @entity112 will start a commendable 12th on his grand prix debut , but the @entity114 has been out - qualified by his team - mate			2
@entity116 , also on his @entity2 bow , sticks his @entity118 in @entity119			2
home favourite @entity34 is on a hot - lap here as he looks to cement his place in the top - 10 shootout			0
he crosses the line with a 1:28.679 to bump him up to sixth , and receives a smattering of applause from the @entity17 crowd			2
@entity0 and @entity18 are happy they 've done enough , and they are back in the @entity11 garage			1
remember , five drivers will be eliminated from this 15 - minute session			2
it 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 in the drop - zone with two minutes to run			2
back on track , and @entity0 leads the way from @entity18			1
the @entity25 is some two tenths quicker than his @entity11 team - mate			2
it is @entity33 up next , albeit over one second down on @entity41			0
and here is a gloomy , but ever - positive , @entity143 : ‘ i think the positives are , looking at winter testing it was difficult , having issues and running short , and suddenly you put a team at a race weekend and you have to stick to the schedule			1
it was never going to be competitive here but still there is a good feeling about the car			0
the basic car is there			0
it is nice that @entity158 have a bit more experience today			0
it is going to be a really difficult tomorrow			0
we have not done a race distance yet			0
’ the second session is underway and the @entity164 of @entity134 is the first driver to take to the track			0
we must mention that his team - mate @entity167 was the other @entity169 driver to be eliminated from @entity119			1

they will start on the final row of the grid			1
@entity133 is given one timed lap to stick his @entity186 into @entity188 and he posts a 1:30.402 which is good enough for @entity191 ... but what can the @entity192 do ? but @entity194 pops his @entity118 into @entity195 and @entity37 goes ninth			0
that leaves @entity170 and @entity143 in the drop - zone			1
@entity198 , yet to take to the track , with less than five minutes			0
with @entity89 not running , only three drivers will be eliminated from @entity119 ; pastor @entity37 and @entity194 are the two drivers set to miss out ... @entity0 quickly usurps @entity18 however , and he tops the timesheets in @entity17			1
but @entity18 , still on the medium compound tyres , pops in a 1:28.906 to go fastest			2

the @entity71 crosses the line some seven tenths faster than @entity32			0
@entity0 , on the medium compound takes a wee trip across the grass on his out - lap. not the ideal start to qualifying from the @entity25 there			1

the @entity102 driver and his team - mate @entity170 , who is deputising for the injured @entity255 , endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the @entity16			1
the @entity178 pair , hampered by reliability problems to their new @entity158 engine , managed only 13 laps between them in friday ’s opening session and were five seconds down on @entity18 ’s best time for @entity11			1
so , with 10 minutes to go until the start of qualifying , why not catch up on the very latest news from @entity17 , starting with @entity0 and his hope that he will be remembered as a legend when he retires from @entity2			1
the @entity102 team have renewed their iconic relationship with @entity272 engine supplier @entity158 , the @entity272 engine supplier which saw @entity178 win four straight drivers ’ and constructors ’ titles between 1988 and 1991			2
but they ’ve struggled in winter testing , and it has n’t got any better in @entity17			2
@entity143 and @entity170 , standing in for the absent @entity255 , propped up the timesheets yesterday			1
and they , along with the @entity281 of @entity282 and @entity198 , were slowest again this morning			0
but @entity143 remains , retained by @entity178 for a sixth season , remains typically optimistic : ‘ this is the package i think will challenge @entity11			1
i really think that …			0
