@entity1 tips has become the latest big - name brand to quietly shrink its product but not the cost – in a step likely to infuriate @entity7 's tea lovers			0
the pyramid teabags are sold on the basis they contain exactly the right amount of tea for a perfect cuppa			1
but each one now has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g , meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g			1
that is the equivalent of six teabags – yet the price of the boxes has stayed the same			1
the change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise			1
rip - off : each @entity29 teabag has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g , meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g this week , @entity33 stores had shelf labels with a price of £ 1.99 for a box of 80 pg tips at 250g			1
but the boxes on the shelf were the new version , weighing 232g			1
the change was spotted by a former buying director for @entity33 , @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity45 , who said : ' i have never seen anything like this in my many years in the grocery trade			1
' they have reduced the weight of tea in the teabag but not the number of teabags in the box			1
' people are getting less tea and that must reduce its strength			0
i really feel that customers are being short - changed			0
' this is one of the biggest tea brands in the country and people will rightly want to know where their tea has gone			0
' the lighter teabags have resulted in the weight of other @entity29 ' boxes coming down , too			1
a box of 40 is now 116g instead of 125g , the 160 pack is 464g , not 500g , and the 240 carton is 696g , down from 750g			2
every day , 165million cups of tea are drunk in the @entity7			0
ninety - six per cent of these are brewed from teabags			2
this means even a tiny reduction in weight can equate to millions of pounds of savings for manufacturers			2
but last night @entity29 ' parent company @entity86 said that the weight change was due to a different mix of leaves – and that the tea still tasted exactly the same			1
a spokesman explained : ' we 've introduced a new blend and new bags whilst ensuring the same great taste of @entity29			0
sneaky : the change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise spot the difference : this week , @entity33 had shelf labels pricing a 250g box of 80 teabags at � � 1.999 - even though the boxes on the shelves were the new 232g versions ' our new blend includes a proportion of leaves that have been pressed to release a natural tea juice			1
' this , combined with new paper , complements the blend , ensuring that the brewing time is unaffected and flavour of the blend is as great as it 's always been			0
' the firm said it had tested its new bags with hundreds of customers who were happy with the flavour			0
but which ? consumer group claimed the change was another example of ' @entity126 '			0
this is the increasingly popular trend for big - brand manufacturers to shrink their products without offering corresponding cuts in the prices			2
the net result is a stealth price rise , because customers get less for their money			0
other culprits in the last five years have included @entity137 , which reduced its 140g bar to 120g , @entity139 ( 34.5g to 32.5g ) , @entity140 ( 58g to 51g ) , @entity142 ( 150g to 126g ) and @entity143 multi-packs ( six eggs down to five )			2
in all cases , the prices remained the same			2
which ? executive director @entity147 said : ' shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices do n't			0
' we want simpler pricing so that people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest			0

each teabag has had its leaves reduced to 0.2g but prices remain the same
the weight of regular box of 80 teabags has gone down from 250g to 232g
@entity168 made so *secretively* that even some supermarkets did not notice
@entity33 priced 250g box at £ 1.99 even though new version was on shelves
