never - before - released @entity0 with veteran female @entity2 officers have given a fascinating insight into women 's lives at the heart of the hyper - male and intrinsically secretive world			1
the four officers , who started as low - ranking typists and ended up in charge of international @entity2 branches , were asked about what it was like to be a woman working in the @entity2 in the 1960s and 70s			1
the riveting conversations were declassified by the @entity2 on october 30			1
often facing rampant sexism and stigma , the officers proved invaluable to the agency			2
on one assignment , an embassy bomb plot was thwarted after an enemy operative divulged secrets to a female agent because she was ' just a woman who was n't very bright '			1

recently declassified interviews with female operatives have revealed what it was like for women in the early years of the agency one agent @entity35 ( last names are redacted in the lengthy interviews ) describes how she joined the agency in 1979 because her husband was an ops officer			1
she began as a ' contract wife ' - employed in low - paid secretarial work to support her husband 's role			0
@entity35 , who at the time she was interviewed was deputy chief of the @entity2 's @entity44 , pointed out that having an eye for luxury clothing gave her an edge when trying to spot the foreign surveillants working undercover			1
she said : ' i always said if i ever wrote a book , i would start it with '' you could tell ' em by their socks ''			0
you would always know surveillants [ redacted word ] at the time by the socks and shoes			0
' we digress here , but with all the [ redacted word ] having such horrible clothes and horrible shoes and socks , the surveillants had good ones			0
' that would never occur to my husband to look at it			0
' the foundation of spying : a ' make - up compact concealment device , ' from the undated @entity2 archives another interviewee @entity75 described the role of wives in the 1970s as ' contract slaves ' but agreed with @entity35 that women were better at detecting other surveillants			1
she said it was especially easy to spot them when they tried to go shopping undercover as ' they just ca n't fake it ' in stores			1
dressed to kill : an evening outfit of a female @entity2 operative which had in - built surveillance equipment @entity75 , who was awarded the @entity2 's @entity90 in 2004 , said : ' i always put that down to women [ being ] more sensitive [ to ] who 's near or in their space , for physical protection			1
' another @entity2 agent @entity97 explained that one enemy operative revealed to her a plot to blow up an embassy simply because he underestimated her as a ' just a woman who was n't very bright ' while she was on assignment			1
@entity97 , who joined the @entity2 in 1965 and was deputy chief of the @entity104 when she retired eight years ago , said : ' i got credit for a recruitment but i never actually had to pitch the guy			1
' anyway i was sort of the '' @entity109 '' personality to survive , and '' @entity111 '' '' @entity110 ! '' and '' wow ! '' ' and this [ redacted word ] that was it , he would seek me out			0
'' oh , could we talk ? '' he would tell me , '' i just love talking to you because you 're not very bright			0
'' ' and i would just sit like this [ makes an innocent expression ] , and i would get home and my spouse would say , '' well how was it ? '' '' golly ! gee ! you know ? wow ! '' @entity97 continued : ' but it worked			0
and finally , unfortunately , the recruitment ended because he told me about a plot to bomb the embassy [ redacted word ] and we arrested him and his gang of merry men as they crossed the border			0
' he just told me everything and i got tons of intel out of him because i was just a woman who was n't very bright			0
' women were initially hired in low - paid roles at the @entity2 to do secretarial work sometimes in support of their husbands who were agents at times , female agents were often required to work undercover with gadgets straight out of a @entity150 movie			1
compact mirrors with pressed powder were adapted for surveillance and bugs implanted into glamorous evening gowns			0
the riveting interviews are part of a wealth of information recently declassified by the @entity2 as a collection entitled ' from typist to @entity162 : the @entity163 in the @entity2 's workforce			1
' with her string of pearls and cheerful grin , @entity165 looks more like a church committee member than one of the @entity2 's most fearsome operatives			1
miss @entity165 ( pictured above ) began as a secretary during the @entity173 at the @entity174 - the predecessor agency to @entity2			1
she gained a wealth of counterintelligence expertise and at the end of @entity173 , was posted to @entity178 in one of the first overseas @entity2 branches			2
she quickly proved to be a highly effective agent in the @entity182			0
miss @entity165 rose through the ranks , eventually becoming the first female chief of station in the late 1970s - the highest foreign position			2
the @entity188 native , a renowned expert on terrorist organizations , was known as ' the iron butterfly ' by colleagues due to her character , ' a perfect southern lady with a core of steel ' , one remarked			0
she retired at the age of 67 in 1987 and passed away , aged 82 , in 2002			0
on her death , then @entity2 director @entity197 said : ' from her earliest days of service with @entity174 , she was a source of inspiration to others			2
' the collection , most of which is being released for the first time , includes hundreds of studies , memos , letters and other official records documenting efforts to improve the status of women employees from 1947 to the present day			1
part of the collection is documents from the 1953 ' @entity216 '			0
despite women making up 40 per cent of @entity2 employees at the time ( 10 per cent higher than in the general @entity222 workforce ) , only one - fifth of those women had even reached a mid-level salary grade - compared to 70 per cent of men			1
family responsibilities and motherhood were seen as huge hindrances by @entity2 bosses at the time			2
chief of operations @entity230 went as far as to say : ' you just get them to a point where they are about to blossom out to a @entity235 , and they get married , go somewhere else , or something over which nobody has any control , and they are out of the running			0
' things had little improved by the 1970s , in particular in the @entity182 where , according to one memo , women were deemed ' limited in their operational potential '			0
towards the end of the 1970s as women began to push through the glass ceiling in other industries , changes slowly crept in at the intelligence agency			2
in 1977 , then - deputy director @entity251 ordered a gender - issues committee to address the lack of senior female employees			0
today 's @entity2 is a different world and popular culture is filled with no - nonsense images of female spies from @entity259 as @entity260 in tv show homeland to @entity263 's portrayal of ' @entity264 ' - the female @entity2 agent credited with tracking down @entity266 - in the movie @entity267			1
there is yet to be a female director of the @entity2 although things appear to be moving encouragingly in this direction			2
in 2011 , 44 per cent of @entity2 employees at the top levels were women - up more than a third since 1980			1
in august , president @entity275 appointed @entity276 as the @entity2 's deputy director - the first woman to ever hold that position			2
many women fall by the wayside due to the extreme demands of the job and its ' @entity285 ' lifestyle			0
according to @entity286 , the @entity2 analyst on whom @entity264 was based in @entity267 was passed over for promotion last year .			0

interviews with female @entity2 employees , who joined the lower ranks in the 1960s and 70s , reveal the sexism they endured
the tapes , released on october 30 , were part of an internal review to try to improve women 's positions at the agency
one female agent said she could always tell foreign surveillants when they *awkwardly* went shopping because ' they just ca n't fake it '
