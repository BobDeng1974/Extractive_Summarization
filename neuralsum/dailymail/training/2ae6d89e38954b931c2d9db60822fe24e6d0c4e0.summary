at just 27 - years - old , @entity0 has had a remarkable hockey career			1
the @entity3 defenseman , who previously played for the @entity4 , was selected third in the @entity5 , played for @entity6 in the @entity7 , and has earned a staggering $ 23million during his career			2
and now all that money , and some more , is gone - because of his parents			2
then , in @entity31 signed a power of attorney that granted his mother full control of his finances shortly before signing a $ 30.5million contract with the @entity4			1
that is when things started to go horribly wrong			0
according to the @entity40 , @entity39 , @entity24 's mother , borrowed at least $ 15 million in her son ’s name against his future earnings			1
what 's more , she borrowed from nonconventional lenders and defaulted on the loans			2
the loans included one from @entity49 congressman @entity48 for $ 2million , with an interest rate of 12 percent , and one from @entity52 for $ 3 million , with an interest rate of 24 percent			1
now , @entity24 has been sued repeatedly for $ 6million in loan repayments after his parents splurged on cars , a home in @entity57 , @entity58 , along with $ 800,00 in upgrades , and travel			1
he has also been forced to declare bankruptcy			0
' @entity24 would ask [ his parents ] questions : " what ’s this ? what are these guys calling about ? " , ' a source told the paper			0
' and they would tell him not to worry about it , just worry about playing hockey			0
' now all @entity24 can claim is assets ' less then $ 50,000 ' and ' debts greater than $ 10million			1
' illustrious career : @entity0 has had an amazing career , playing for the 2010 @entity76 team ( left ) as well as the @entity77 ( left ) and the @entity4 rough life : now @entity0 owes more than $ 10million and is having all his checks garnished his paychecks from the @entity3 meanwhile , who are paying him $ 5million this season , are garnished as soon as he receives them			1
the source said he is no longer speaking to his parents			0
' i ’ve seen lots of instances of parents riding their kid ’s coattails around , ' said one @entity12 executive			2
' i ’ve never seen a case as ugly as this one , where the parents took such advantage of their kid			0
' @entity24 , who has hired a new team of financial advisers , is taking the high road still somehow , despite this awful setback			1
' ' i ’d say i picked the wrong people who led me down the wrong path , ' he said			0
' i ’ve got people in place who are going to fix everything now			0
it ’s something i should have done a long time ago			0

@entity12 star @entity0 made his parents his financial advisers in 2008 , and signed over control of his money to his mother in 2011
the parents of the @entity77 defenseman then spent his money on cars , travel and a new loan
@entity0 's parents also took out *non-conventional* loans , and defaulted on them
the loans included one for $ 2million , with an interest rate of 12 percent , and one for $ 3 million , with an interest rate of 24 percent
now , @entity0 is bankrupt and still owes $ 10million or more to debtors
