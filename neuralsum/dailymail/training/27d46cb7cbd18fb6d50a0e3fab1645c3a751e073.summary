by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 25 june 2013 @entity3 ’s former prime minister @entity2 was sentenced to seven years in jail for sex and corruption offences yesterday – but doubts were immediately raised about whether he will ever spend a day behind bars			1
a court in @entity10 ruled the billionaire politician , 76 , had sex with underage prostitute ‘ @entity13 ’ at his bunga bunga parties while in office and used his power to cover it up			0
in a now infamous phone call , the ex-premier freed the former exotic dancer – real name @entity22 – from police custody by claiming she was the niece of deposed @entity25 president @entity24			0
the ruling is not final until he has exhausted two levels of appeal , and even then he may not see the inside of a cell because of the country ’s lenient laws for sentencing over- 70s			0
@entity2 has been brought to trial some 30 times , although very rarely convicted			2
last month an appeals court upheld a sentence against him for tax fraud , leaving him one more appeal at the end of this year			1
questioned : @entity59 appeared in court in a previous trial in @entity10			0
but @entity2 's team eventually dropped her from the witness list after she failed to show on a couple of occasions in the current trial appeals : @entity2 can appeal against the decision of the @entity69 , pictured , before it becomes final - meaning he will not serve any time in prison if his appeals are successful if that verdict also goes against him , the original sentence of four years in jail and a five - year bar from holding public office would take effect , essentially ending his political career			1
the latest ruling followed a two - year trial in which the court heard titillating details of a ‘ ring of prostitution ’ centred at @entity2 ’s mansion outside @entity10			2
at the time of the bunga bunga parties , in 2010 , @entity30 was 17 , a year under the legal age for prostitution in @entity3			1
@entity2 always claimed the soirees were ‘ elegant dinners ’ with an atmosphere of ‘ good cheer ’			0
but this version of events contrasted wildly with that of the prosecutors , who said @entity30 was ‘ part of a prostitution system set up for the personal sexual satisfaction of the defendant ’			0
former undersecretary to the minister of @entity105 during @entity2 's time in office , @entity104 , pictured center , listens as the verdict against the former @entity110 is read out @entity10 's chief prosecutor @entity112 , left , shakes hand with with @entity2 lawyer @entity114 who described the sentence as unjust alias : @entity22 is better known as ' @entity117 ' statement : @entity2 's lawyer @entity119 speaks to reporters outside the courthouse in @entity10 , @entity3 , today after judges found him guilty of having sex with a minor			1

@entity2 found guilty of paying a *teenager* for sex
age of *consent* is 14 in @entity3 but it 's *illegal* to pay anyone under *18* for sex
he was sentenced to seven years in prison and a *lifetime* *ban* from politics
but he may never serve any jail time if he gets verdict *overturned* on appeal
ex-premier recently found guilty of tax fraud which his lawyers are appealing
