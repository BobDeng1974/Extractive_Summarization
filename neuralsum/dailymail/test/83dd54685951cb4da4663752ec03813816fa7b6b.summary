@entity0 should be gearing up for her first legal drink on saturday			1
probably at college , probably able to drive , she should be toasting the next phase of her life with her mother , stepfather , brother , sister and cousins at home in @entity13 , @entity14			1

one photograph encapsulated the terror : a firefighter emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of @entity0			1
her 23 - year - old single mother saw the picture on the front page of the local paper the next day			1
a day later , it had swept the world			1
two decades on , the shock is still raw			2
one photograph encapsulated the terror : a firefighter , @entity39 , emerging from the burning wreckage cradling the lifeless body of @entity0 ' it does n't get easier ' : @entity42 - @entity41 , pictured at the memorial for her daughter @entity44 , who was killed in the @entity0 bombing of 1995 the day after her first birthday then a 23 - year - old single mother , @entity42 saw the picture of her lifeless daughter on the front page of the local paper the next day			1
a day later it was on the cover of newspapers across the world painful : @entity42 said she learns to deal with the grief but the milestones get more difficult every year			1
@entity44 ( pictured ) had just turned one when @entity42 dropped her off at a daycare center before going to work remembering : @entity42 and her family throw a party for @entity44 on her birthday every year horrific : @entity42 describes how she searched for hours for @entity44 until eventually , in @entity65 , she was approached by a priest and a pediatrician who delivered the devastating news ' it gets harder every year , ' @entity42 - @entity41 told @entity70 from her home on the outskirts of @entity0 , where she lives with her husband and two children			1
' people say " it ’ll get easier " or " you ’ll find closure "			1
i do n’t think it does , and i do n’t think i will			2
' i had to see @entity44 dead every day			1
no one should ever have to see that			2
' you learn to deal with it differently , but every year the milestones are worse			1
twenty - one is the worst			2
everything i missed , everything i did n’t get to be part of			2
i ’m trying not to think about it			2
’ as the 20 - year anniversary approaches , many still feel betrayed and bemused by the attackers , who branded themselves patriots			1
unlike @entity97 and the 9/11 hijackers , @entity22 had fought for his country in the @entity100			1
parking a rented @entity102 truck loaded with explosives outside the @entity105 building that morning was his way of attacking the ' tyrannical ' federal government			2
he told a court he wanted revenge for the 76 lives lost in a fire at the @entity113 barracks in @entity114 , exactly two years earlier , when the @entity116 ham - handedly tried to expel intruders			2
he was executed in 2001 , and his co-conspirator @entity118 , now 60 , remains in jail serving 161 life sentences			2
even before investigators identified the @entity17 perpetrators , the country was struggling to understand the concept of terrorism in @entity0			1
when the building exploded at 9.01am , mrs @entity41 thought it was construction work			2
but word soon reached her office , and she spent the next two hours scouring hospitals for her only child			0
eventually , sitting in the crammed waiting room at @entity65 , she was approached by a pediatrician and a priest who delivered the news			0
she did n’t know aspiring photojournalist @entity138 had captured the moment @entity44 was carried from the building , her pink socks stained red from the shards of glass , in a picture that would go on to win a @entity145			1
' i was very young at the time , i was 23 , ' she said			0
' my parents saw the picture on the paper the next morning and tried to hide it from me			0
i came downstairs looking for something to read and they said " we did n’t get any mail today "			0
' i knew that was ridiculous , we always got the paper			0
so i went looking around for it and , yes , as soon as i saw it i said , " that ’s @entity44 "			1
the @entity0 bombing , planted by veteran @entity23 soldier @entity22 , killed 168 people it was the worst case of homegrown terrorism @entity17 has ever seen , and shook the nation unlike @entity97 and the 9/11 hijackers , @entity22 had fought for his country in the @entity100 then - president @entity166 responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches : ' the loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives			1
’ then - first lady @entity173 holds her face in distress at the ceremony to remember the dead in 1995 ' for some reason i thought i would know if my daughter was going to be on the front page			2
it was strange , it was horrible			0
' @entity184 saw it as fiction - she was n’t a person			0
they made money off it like she was n’t real			0
' to the @entity41 family , she is very much still with them			0
@entity42 met @entity23 veteran @entity196 through a friend soon after the attack			0
they married in 1997 , and together they have two children : @entity202 , 17 , and @entity203 , 13			0
every year they throw a birthday party in @entity44 ’s honor , with a cake and a family meal			1
@entity202 and @entity203 know they are two of three siblings			0
' my husband has been really great , he has always been supportive of what i 've been through and to him , @entity44 is part of our life together			1
' my kids have always known that they have a sister and that she went to heaven , so they expect us to celebrate her birthday like we do theirs			2
' for them , the picture is painful too			0
' @entity202 did a paper at school the other day about commercials and how they use images			2
one of the photographs they were given was that picture			0
' she just dealt with it the best way she can			0
that ’s her sister , she knows what happened			0
so to see that picture , that hurts			0
' nonetheless , the family has been the subject of scrutiny , anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks			0
with her child the ' face ' of the tragedy , other grieving families felt @entity42 and the firefighter , @entity39 , stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion			2
during the barrage of media attention , the pair grew a bond , which remains today - and it was erroneously assumed they had become romantically involved			0
' we do still see each other , @entity39 and his wife have been very supportive , they are such good people			2
but they wo n't be coming to the ceremony , they keep themselves out of that stuff			0
' that whole thing was difficult , and just something else you have to learn how to deal with			0
' consequently , @entity42 - @entity41 is apprehensive about this year ’s 20 - year anniversary ceremony			1
' we do n’t all have something in common just because we lost a child , ' she explains			0
tough : @entity42 has been the subject of scrutiny , anger and at times hatred in the wake of the attacks @entity42 met @entity23 veteran @entity196 through a friend soon after the attack			0
they married in 1997 , and together they have two children : @entity202 , 17 , and @entity203 , 13 difficulty for all of them : @entity42 said her children ( pictured ) know that they are two of three siblings other grieving families felt @entity42 and the firefighter , @entity39 , stole the limelight from their loved ones who paled into oblivion after the photograph received so much attention ( pictured : the memorial ) ' i know after the bombing the other families did n’t like me , and i ’m not looking forward to that			1
' i have just always tried to represent myself the best way possible because when @entity44 ’s looking down at me from heaven i want her to be proud of the things i have done			1
' i did n’t want any of this , to see @entity44 dead everywhere every day , but that ’s just the way it happened			1
' between the ages of 23 and 43 , @entity42 - @entity41 , has dedicated herself to ensuring daycare centers are fully secure			0
congressional bill number @entity309 , or ' @entity311 ' , became law in 2000 to ensure a standard of glass protection in public buildings			0
@entity22 had enlisted his co-conspirators to build a car bomb that would shatter the windows of the building - a horrific detail that severely impacted the force of the explosion			1
it took weeks to find an attorney to represent @entity22 after he was coincidentally detained during a traffic stop 45 minutes after the attack			1
eventually , @entity327 agreed to defend his actions ’ to ensure he had a fair trial ’			0
speaking this week , @entity327 conceded : ' we all remember what we were doing			0
it is the @entity333 of @entity0			1
' this was a scar and never - ending wrong that affected not only @entity0 and the people there but the nation at large , ' he told @entity339			1
then - president @entity166 responded to the attack days later with one of his most famous speeches : ' the loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives			0
’ indeed , @entity346 earned a reputation for compassion in the wake of the bombing - a sense of charity that came to be known as ' the @entity353 '			0
on sunday , in a ceremony held at 9.01am at the site of the attack , @entity166 and city officials will lead tributes to the city ’s resilience , and read out the names of the 168 people who lost their lives			1
and the picture of @entity39 holding @entity44 will be shown			1
though heart - wrenching for her , she says she is attempting to compartmentalize it			0
’ if i saw @entity44 every time i looked at that photograph , i would n’t be able to get past that			1
i would n’t be able to carry on , ’ she said			0
' to me , basically , i try to see that picture as something which represents everybody who died in that bombing			0
it ’s everybody ’s baby			2

it is 20 years since the worst case of homegrown terrorism in @entity17 *history*
@entity22 killed 168 people with bomb in @entity0 in 1995
@entity386 was encapsulated by photo of a firefighter carrying a lifeless baby
that baby was @entity0 , who had turned one the day before
nearing what would have been her 21st birthday , her mother @entity396 tells @entity70 how she marks @entity44 *'s* birthday every year
but says she will never get over the pain of seeing that photograph
she is still in touch with the firefighter who was pictured with the baby
