@entity0 become the first person to score a double century in a @entity4 match as batting records tumbled in @entity8 ' 73 - run @entity7 victory over @entity9			1
in an action - packed match at the @entity12 in @entity13 , destructive opener @entity0 overcame a nervy start , including surviving a tight lbw call in the first over , to thump 10 fours and an incredible 16 sixes in a superb knock of 215 off 147 deliveries - the third highest one - day international score of all time			1
the 35 - year - old needed just 33 balls in his second ton as he moved into an elite club , with @entity28 recording the previous highest score at cricket 's premier 50 - over competition when he made 188 not out for @entity33 against the @entity34 in february 1996			1
he fell to the final ball of the innings as the @entity8 reached 372 for two before @entity9 were bowled for 289 - with @entity0 claiming two wickets - as they failed to reach their target of 363			1
the left - hander also played his part in setting the highest ever partnership in @entity73 as he and @entity74 ( 133 not out ) scored all of their side 's runs , along with 24 extras			2
' with the innings , i struggled at the start and it was scary the first ball			0
i was like " come on you 're not serious , i ca n't be out on this first ball "			0
i needed a chance and got a break and made the best use of it , ' he said on @entity90			0
' there 's been a lot of pressure and the runs have n't been coming			0
this is the first time ever in my career that so many people wanted me to score runs and the messages keep coming in on @entity101 , it 's the first time i 've ever seen so many people wanting @entity0 to perform			1
' in the end , i 'm glad i gave them something to actually cheer about			0
overall , i 'm really happy and i want to try and build on this as much as possible			0
the team can gain some momentum going into @entity33			2
' @entity9 actually made an ideal start despite losing the toss as @entity112 's second delivery nipped back into @entity114 's off stump , but that was as good as it got			2
@entity0 was rapped on the pads two balls later but he was reprieved by the on - field umpire and the decision review system			2
it was a crucial let - off for the veteran left - hander and he gradually started to find some fluency with a towering six off @entity123 giving an indication of what was to follow			0
he brought up his century - his 22nd in odis and first since june 2013 - in the 36th over , a position from which he propelled himself in expert fashion			0
@entity0 was given a life on 121 when he was caught on the long - on boundary , but the umpire correctly ruled bowler @entity112 had overstepped and the batsman made sure they were punished			2
he fell to the final ball , skying a catch to midwicket , but by then it was damage limitation for the @entity139			0
between them , @entity0 and his batting partner @entity74 ( right ) scored all their team 's runs @entity0 survived a scare early on after @entity9 bowler @entity145 's lbw appeal in reply , @entity9 lost @entity147 cheaply to @entity148 and the rain covers came out with the score 18 - 1 , but play resumed less than 20 minutes later with a new revised target for 363 with the loss of two overs			1
@entity155 ( five ) lost his wicket soon after as he was bowled lbw by @entity157 and the @entity139 wickets continued to tumble as opener @entity159 , who was their biggest threat hitting five fours in his 26 - run total , fell to a well - taken catch from @entity166 in the deep off @entity148			0
@entity167 of @entity9 is bowled during his country 's response to @entity0 's fireworks @entity171 ( foreground ) falls onto his back as he evades a bouncer delivered by @entity175 ( right ) @entity0 had the last laugh and celebrated the wicket of @entity9 's @entity178 @entity171 ( 37 ) and @entity123 began to steady the ship with a fourth - wicket partnership of 80 before the former fell victim to @entity74 and @entity123 ' ( 76 ) time at the crease came to an end in the 28th over as @entity148 claimed his third wicket			1
@entity157 ( three for 38 ) dropped @entity185 on the boundary a ball after @entity9 had reached the 200 mark but @entity0 claimed his scalp for 52 shortly after and @entity178 ( 19 ) followed , bowled lbw to the double centurion			1
@entity112 ( four ) and @entity191 ( 21 ) - caught by @entity0 at extra-cover - were both skittled by @entity157 to leave @entity9 with a mountain to climb before they crumbled to defeat with @entity167 ( 16 ) the last man to fall .			1
