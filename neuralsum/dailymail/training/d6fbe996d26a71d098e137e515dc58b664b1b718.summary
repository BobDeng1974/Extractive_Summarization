at the age of 90 , the international concert pianist @entity0 played @entity3 ’s piano concerto number 23 to rapturous applause in @entity6 ’s @entity5 last year and , for an encore , a @entity9 moment musicale — no printed music score , just memory and perfect co-ordination			1
it was an astonishing accomplishment for any individual , let alone one in his tenth decade			0
yet when i asked @entity0 afterwards how he was able to perform such a feat , he told me it all came down to luck — not only luck with his genes , but luck to have ‘ music to give my life meaning ’			1
of course , we can not all play an instrument to concert performance standard , but we can all find that bit of luck — that meaning in life — which will make our old age a fulfilled and happy one , and thus leave us feeling younger for longer			1
in the earlier parts of this series , i have explained the importance that health and fitness play in defying the years			2
but i believe the social and psychological effects of growing old are equally important to address — and are often overlooked by doctors , with the inevitable focus on physical health in our later years			1
in fact , the older you get , the greater the need for a positive mental attitude and some positive action			2
after all , a human being is so much more than the sum of all their organs and systems			0
watch your @entity53 the @entity54 has defined health as ‘ complete physical , social and mental wellbeing ’ — a state that few people achieve ! however , many older people with long - term health conditions are nevertheless in a state of social and mental wellbeing			1
on the other hand , there are many younger people who have no disease but who do not seem to be in a state of wellbeing at all			1
wellbeing , then , is an attitude of mind			0
some people appear to be better able to adjust to setbacks and tragedies than others			0
this is what is called resilience , and probably stems from early childhood , but it is possible to become more resilient and change your life for the better			2
try this little auditing process : as well as being a cause for celebration , it is a reminder of the need to reflect , think , learn , decide and act to live a full and rewarding life			1
a busy life is a happy life retirement comes as a welcome relief to many people , especially those engaged in unsatisfactory or depressing jobs			2
but even some of them find adjustment to their new life difficult			0
the @entity100 has helped launched an initiative called @entity102 : the @entity103 for @entity104 for people who have had rewarding jobs in which they gained pleasure from using their skills and experience , and respect and positive feedback from the people they were serving , retirement can be a blow			1
pre-retirement education , which is offered by many companies , can reduce the adverse effects , but the best approach is to regard retirement as just another change in occupation , albeit one in which your income drops , dramatically for some people			1
yes , part of the time should certainly be filled doing the things you have always wanted to do but have not had the time to do when working			0
but research has proven that continuing to interact and work with others is very good for you as well as for them — maintaining and improving your intellectual functioning			2
the way it does this is not clear , but it may stem from the need to argue and defend your point of view as well as the need to organise your thoughts			0
it may also be the interaction with other people that stimulates the mind , and that the increased motivation and morale which results from this improves how you think and how you feel			2
working to boost the wellbeing of others is particularly rewarding			0
here are a few suggestions of what you might want to do : get to the heart of depression @entity158 is a common emotional challenge for many people aged 70 and upwards			0
some people will indeed need medication for it , but for many people the solution is to think differently — take more exercise , and become more engaged with other people			2
this is not simply a case of saying ‘ pull yourself together ’			2
it recognises that depressive thoughts are common and sometimes very serious , and that there are both good reasons to be depressed at 70 or 80 , and good measures to prevent — and reduce — the problem			0
take more exercise , and become more engaged with other people ( picture posed by models ) the first step is to try to understand the causes of depression , and those that are more common in older age groups			1
people of any age can be depressed : by medical problems , by loneliness , by loss of the ability to get out and about , or by poverty			1
all these reasons are more common as age increases , so some part of the work to help people feel less depressed rests not with the treatment of depression but with effective treatment of medical problems			1
for example , a hip replacement will be much more effective than anti-depressants for someone who is housebound , lonely and unable to sleep because of pain due to arthritis of the hip joint			0
of course , for some people loneliness is a consequence of the loss of a partner and the effects of bereavement are still underestimated by those who have not experienced the devastating effects of the loss of a partner or , particularly distressing , a child			2
the @entity219 does wonderful work in this area			2
visit cruse.org.uk to find out what counselling and support services are available in your area or call their national helpline : 0844 477 9400			1
the problem of poverty is less easy to tackle because it is rooted in the inequalities that persist in almost every society			0
every month people are advised to work longer to build up their pension pot , but this is little comfort to people who are already retired or who are not allowed to work past a fixed age			2
but attitudes are changing — there are now more than one million people aged 65 or older in the workforce — and many firms now actively seek to employ older people , often in jobs that the young ca n’t be bothered with			1
@entity247 has excellent advice on finding for work in older age			1
just visit ageuk.org.uk and click on ‘ work and learning ’			1
look on the @entity254 much of the negative image of old age stems from research that was badly designed — directly comparing people who are 70 or 80 with people who are 20			1
this is an unfair comparison , because of the advances of diet and healthcare , for example , that make today ’s environment so much better for older people			1
it really is time to say ‘ goodbye to growing @entity268 ’ ( picture posed by models ) in fact , when researchers follow people through life , the rate of decline and loss of function is much less today , and among the older generation many abilities actually improve			1
evidence of this can be found in abundance in scientific journals at the @entity285 near @entity286 — many of which can be accessed online			0
put ‘ healthy ageing ’ or ‘ healthy aging ’ into the search box of @entity290 , where more than 23,000 scientific articles are presented			2
just a few hours grazing through them can cheer you up no end ! if some of it seems a bit technical , then i particularly recommend a recent book called @entity302 , by @entity303 , professor of neuropsychology at the @entity305 in the @entity306 , who clearly explains how wrong many of our assumptions have been about the workings of older brains			0
here are some of the book ’s key positive findings : wisdom can be defined as having insight into the major issues of life and the ability to make balanced decisions in uncertain situations			1
we become wiser thanks to the erosion of our mental faculties : the ageing brain works more slowly , and our responses are therefore more sensible			0
you may be ageing , then , but with the right attitude , there is so much to enjoy , to celebrate — and look forward to			0
you see ? it really is time to say ‘ goodbye to growing @entity268 ’			1
as we grow older , many of us find our mood sinking as we spend more time reflecting on and regretting the past and on worrying about the future			1
one way to achieve a happier and more positive outlook , then , is to spend more time focusing on the present			0
this is called ‘ @entity347 ’ and is a series of exercises that will help you live more ‘ in the moment ’ and think more about the present			1
a doctor will sometimes now refer a person who is depressed to a mindfulness group or to some other form of cognitive or psychological therapy instead of prescribing a drug			0
one of the strengths of mindfulness is that you can do it by yourself at home , without a psychologist in the room , with the help of one of the cds which are available , for example , the @entity366 by @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369			0
for some people it might be better to start in a supervised group — look for adverts or posters of groups starting in your area			1
but here is a simple exercise you can practise at home			0

the social and psychological effects of growing old are very important
many older people with long - term health conditions are nevertheless in a state of social and mental wellbeing
*sir* @entity387 offers some insights into how to get on well with life in your later years
every day : reflect on the problems and challenges you have already *overcome* .
every ***birthday*** : do not regard your 59th , 67th or 73rd ***birthday*** as ‘ just another ***birthday*** ’ .
work as a volunteer on an issue that you feel *strongly* about , whether that ’s a local *charity* that always needs more help or a *global* cause such as campaigning for the environment . @entity247 is a great organisation and offers a wide range of *opportunities* ( ageuk.org.uk ) . supporting it and helping it support others will also help you .
be your own boss ! the @entity100 has helped launched an initiative called @entity102 : the @entity100 ’s @entity430 — the only national organisation dedicated to providing everyone over 50 with the support to start their own business . visit *prime.org.uk* .
become a member of your local @entity437 to contribute your views about *current* services and future developments of the service in your area ( google your local trust or go to *nhsproviders.org* ) .
spend more time helping your children and **grandchildren** , and if your own are far away , help someone else ’s **grandchildren** who live near you but whose own *grandparents* are also far away .
every *school* needs people to help *pupils* with reading and *arithmetic* , and the wisdom that mature volunteers can bring is *invaluable* .
older people cope better with emotions and stress , and are better at making complex decisions .
some cognitive skills are *unaffected* by age , or even improve , such as general *knowledge* and *vocabulary* .
older people are more stable and can cope better with their feelings .
older people are likely to be nicer than 20 - year - olds .
