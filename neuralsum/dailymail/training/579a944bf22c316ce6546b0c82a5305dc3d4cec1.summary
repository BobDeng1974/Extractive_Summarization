it may have made its way up the pole to become one of @entity5 's most famous chain of lap dancing clubs , but when it comes down to the actual financials @entity9 appears to be getting a little hot under the collar			1
for the company , which runs five adult entertainment clubs across the country , has filed accounts showing that it made a loss of £ 2.1million in 2011			2
the drop is far greater than the £ 733,265 loss recorded in 2010			0
not in pole position : @entity9 has recorded a loss of £ 2.1m for 2011 this is all despite pulling in a considerable £ 9.9m in revenue , up from £ 8.5m the previous year			1
and despite the losses , @entity5 boss @entity22 , who once famously suggested that struggling students should strip their way through college , kept his salary the same at £ 304,000			0
according to the @entity5 operations ' accounts , the profit loss was a result of writing off £ 2.5m of goodwill and debts to other businesses within the group and the results were " considered satisfactory by the directors given the prevailing economic conditions			2
" working up the pole : despite losses , @entity9 plans to expand and take on 60 new dancers other factors included rising administration costs , ill - fated business ventures and the departure of the @entity47 founder of @entity9 , @entity48 , who left the @entity5 business in april			2
the accounts also reveal that the company owes @entity53 more than £ 2m , which it has agreed to repay under a " time to pay " agreement			0
it also seems the chain also owes almost £ 3m to @entity58 , which owns 12 clubs in the @entity47			0
despite the losses , @entity9 says it has plans to expand and take on 60 new dancers and only last week the company applied to run the country 's first 24 - hour lap dancing club at its @entity66 venue			1
no - one from @entity9 was available for comment			0
profit and loss : @entity5 boss @entity22 faced £ 2.1m losses this week , despite the company turning over £ 9.9m in revenue chain : @entity9 runs five gentlemen 's clubs across the country			1

@entity9 records £ 2.1m loss in 2011
losses come despite lap dancing chain pulling in £ 9.9m in revenue
