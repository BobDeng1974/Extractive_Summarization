by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 15:06 est , 8 november 2012 a policewoman was ' bullied and victimised ' by male bosses who cancelled the leave she had booked for her wedding after labelling her a ' trouble - maker ' , a tribunal was told			1
shocked police constable @entity8 , 47 , only found out that her line manager had ordered the cancellation when her now husband , a police sergeant , checked her leave dates on the @entity14 system while she was signed off work sick			1
@entity16 is suing the force for sexual and disability discrimination after she accused her bosses of turning against her because of previous complaints she filed against senior colleagues			1
' victimised ' : @entity22 @entity8 claims her bosses at @entity14 cancelled leave she had booked for her upcoming wedding without informing her the newlywed - who suffers from asthma and carpal tunnel syndrome along with a depressive condition - also claims she was taken off some of her @entity31 duties , ordered to perform a role she was not trained to do , and was ' over-scrutinised ' by inspector @entity33 and superintendent @entity34			1
in 2007 @entity16 was awarded £ 2,000 as compensation for injury to feelings , after she took the force to an employment tribunal on similar discrimination accusations relating to the provision of body armour to female officers , and the allocation of on - call duties			1
a year later the officer , who has worked for @entity14 since 1985 , was elected as a @entity48 representative and tasked with helping other officers - particularly in disputes with their bosses			1
but in 2011 she was told that her ability to represent her colleagues had been affected by her own employment tribunal claim , leading her to lodge a second complaint in which she named @entity56			1
newlyweds : the officer 's now husband sergeant @entity58 noticed her pre-booked leave had been cancelled while she was off sick ' he commented to me that because of my previous employment tribunal claim he did n’t know if i was " whiter than white " , ' she said in a statement given to the @entity64 in @entity65 , as part of her third and most recent hearing			1
that claim went to a judicial mediation process and she was again awarded compensation for injury to feelings , this time for £ 1,500 pounds			1
@entity16 has claimed that since her second complaint she was ' bullied ' by @entity56			1
@entity34 , who then turned her line manager insp			0
her role with the @entity48 was downgraded to a three day a week post and she was told to also work as an enquiry officer , working on road traffic collisions while other representatives were retained full - time			2
@entity16 said that she had come up with a list of different posts she could take on as she wanted a ' fresh start ' , but was returned to work with the criminal justice department			1
she had been an enquiry officer before working with the @entity48 , but claimed she felt undertrained to take on the role due to changes in the way the job was done - including carrying out interviews on dvds instead of tapes			2
the 47 - year - old was moved from the police headquarters in @entity93 , @entity94 , to @entity95 , closer to her home in @entity97			1
but @entity16 said she found her new office dirty and unkempt , and her colleagues unwelcoming			2
' i felt under pressure to start the @entity103 role without any training and before arrangements had been put in place to allow me to perform the role from @entity95 , as agreed , ' she said in her statement			0
@entity33 had wanted her to start her new role without being trained , or even being able to access the computer systems , while she was still trying to balance her work as a representative ' looking after damaged and needy officers ' - which she still considered a full - time post			2
she said that he then ordered that a duties manager gain access to her @entity118 and she felt he had become ' distrustful and wary ' of her , as well as being ' over scrutinising '			0
the officer also discovered that insp			0
@entity33 was copying their email correspondence to @entity56			0
@entity34 , leading her to feel ' micro-managed by @entity109			0
@entity33 and bullied by @entity56			0
' i believe that insp			0
@entity33 had been directed in his actions by @entity56			0
@entity34 was victimising me as a direct result of my previous employment tribunal complaint against the force , and him , ' she said			1
' i believe from the treatment i have received and the conversations i have had with @entity109			0
@entity33 that he and @entity56			0
@entity34 had formed the view that i was a " trouble maker " and needed to be more closely managed than other officers			2
' i believe that @entity56			0
@entity34 had wrongly formed the view that i was deliberately not starting the @entity138 role , which had been agreed at the judicial mediation and that he directed @entity109			0
@entity33 to supervise me closely as a result			2
' @entity141 , who also suffers from asthma and carpel tunnel syndrome as well as having a ' depressive condition ' , was signed off with work - related stress in november 2011			2
while she was off work , she claimed that @entity109			0
@entity33 had ordered her previously approved leave - including time off for her wedding in march of this year , and subsequent honeymoon , to be cancelled			1
her partner @entity58 was able to re-apply for her leave , which was granted with just weeks to spare until their big day			2
she refuted an argument from the force that her leave was cancelled because she had not applied for it properly , through @entity109			1
@entity16 has since returned to work , but an occupational health therapist has recommended that she remain on non-confrontational duties until after the tribunal , meaning that she has not yet returned to her enquiry officer post			1
the tribunal , in front of a panel chaired by judge @entity163 , continues			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
