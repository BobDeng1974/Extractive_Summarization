by @entity1 reporter published : 00:22 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 13:12 est , 4 december 2012 to their many fans , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 may be irreplaceable - but @entity7 believes it has found the perfect group of reality stars to fill the whole they are about to leave in our lives			1
@entity13 is set to air its series finale on december 13 , and the network has just announced that its old timeslot will be taken by a new show centring around the wild lifestyles of country folk in @entity20			1
the boys and girls of @entity23 are set to bring a new backwoods spirit to @entity7 on thursday nights , and will surely hoping to capture the nation 's hearts in the same way as the notorious gang of guidos did			1
gang : @entity23 showcases a group of young friends living in the tiny town of @entity35 , @entity20 antics : the cast members seem to spend much of their time rolling around in mud country style : the @entity23 girls are not afraid to join in with traditionally masculine pursuits it is easy to forget that when @entity13 first appeared in 2009 , the cast was made up of complete unknowns			1
so the nine residents of @entity35 , @entity20 featured in @entity23 have every chance of making the leap to national celebrities , like their tanned predecessors			2
a trailer released by @entity7 warns viewers to expect lewd behaviour , raging arguments and sometimes incomprehensible @entity56 accents			2
it opens with one of the girls saying : ' @entity20 is a place founded on freedom - for me and my friends , that means the freedom to do whatever the [ bleep ] we want			0
' she adds , ' our motto round here is : " whatever happens , happens			0
" ' danger : the @entity56 residents seem to be enamoured of stupid and dangerous stunts suffering : this cast member rolled down a hill immediately after wolfing down 14 hot wings cutting loose : these @entity77 love a good party as much as their @entity80 predecessors the trailer continues with a montage of reckless stunts involving large explosions , dangerous motorcycles and a bizarre amount of sliding around in mud			0
the image of rural residents as backwards is promoted by an interview with high school prom king @entity91 , who says : ' i do n't have no phone , @entity94 ... none of that internet stuff			0
' and some of the behaviour shown in the trailer seems utterly insane - for example , when one cast member rolls down a hill in a tyre moments after saying , ' i just gone and eaten 14 hot wings			0
' in many respects , there seems to be little difference between the stars of @entity23 and those of @entity13 - the @entity110 are shown fighting with their neighbours and indulging in dubious sexual pursuits			1
stereotype : the youths do little to dispel the popular image of country dwellers as rustic people fun : the cast members have known each other since childhood and describe themselves as ' family ' old - fashioned : @entity91 memorably says , ' i do n't have no phone , @entity94 ... none of that internet stuff ' one young woman can be seen fighting with her boyfriend , then promptly licking the torso of another cast member to celebrate his birthday			0
however , the cast of @entity23 are keen to emphasise that they have a gentler side too , as the clip 's narrator says : ' we all grew up here together - we 're just like family			2
' and the trailer 's final scene supports this , as one of the show 's gentlemen toasts the ladies , saying : ' thanks for dinner , and i hope it tastes as good as y'all look			0
' sweet : the friends share a touching moment in between the fights and the swearing new hit ? @entity7 is hoping @entity23 can replicate the success of @entity13 after taking over its timeslot besides , while the cast may not seem particularly well educated , they are smarter than they appear - a number of them are college graduates who are simply enjoying the simple life in their home town before starting their careers			1
@entity23 starts on @entity7 on thursday january 3 at 10pm			1
