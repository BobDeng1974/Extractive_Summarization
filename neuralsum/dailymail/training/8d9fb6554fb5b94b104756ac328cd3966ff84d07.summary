by @entity0 a suspect in the 2012 terrorist attack in @entity3 , @entity4 , that claimed the life of @entity7 ambassador @entity6 and three other @entity7 , was found dead monday , according to reports from @entity9			1
the network cites a ' @entity4 source and locals in the town of @entity14 , ' who say @entity15 was found dead in the eastern @entity4 town			1

@entity9 reports that @entity15 also had contact with @entity25 members in @entity32			1
in march 2013 , @entity15 was detained by @entity4 officials who suspected he had played a part in the attack			1
during his detention , @entity37 officials were allowed to interview him in front of @entity4 officials			1
the @entity4 warlord who allegedly led the 2012 attack on the @entity7 consulate in @entity3 , @entity4 , has been captured by @entity44 commandos			1
@entity46 was taken off the streets of @entity3 and whisked away to a ' secure location outside of @entity4 ' for interrogation on sunday , the @entity45 reports			1
@entity50 reports that he is currently en route to the @entity7 aboard a @entity53 ship			1
once on @entity7 soil , he is expected to face trial on terrorism charges in federal court in @entity58 caught : delta force commandos nabbed @entity46 , the 42 - year - old suspected ringleader in the 2012 @entity3 consulate attack on sunday after he taunted @entity7 officials for months @entity46 is said to be a ' senior leader ' of @entity63 - the group that @entity7 officials believe was behind the attack that killed four @entity7 on september 11 , 2012 - including @entity7 ambassador @entity6			1
@entity7 officials have stopped short of calling him a ' mastermind			1
' nearly two years after the deadly assault , he is the first person held to account by @entity7 authorities			2
@entity46 , a 42 - year - old hardline @entity72 leader , has openly taunted @entity7 authorities for years , appearing in public in @entity3 for several interviews with @entity7 media , including @entity9 , in august 2013 - days after the @entity77 levied terrorism charges against him			1
@entity7 commandos and the @entity37 captured @entity46 , said to be one of the masterminds behind the 2012 consulate attack in @entity3 , @entity4 burned out : the @entity7 consulate in @entity3 was burned out and destroyed by the terrorist attack on september 11 , 2012			1
@entity46 is the only person so far arrested for the deadly raid @entity46 has remained free to roam his hometown of @entity87 , despite being indicted by @entity7 authorities			2
he said he was never questioned by @entity7 officials even though he made no attempt to hide			2
he told the @entity89 that he did not plan or participate in the assault , though he admitted he was there at the end			0
witnesses describe seeing him direct the fighters who stormed the gates of the @entity7 compound			2
the raid sunday was carried out jointly by @entity44 , the @entity100 's most elite special operations unit , and the @entity37 after more than a year of planning , the @entity97 reports			0
the commandos even went so far as to build a mock - up of @entity46 's compound on their base at @entity106 , @entity107 - like the @entity53 's @entity108 did before the @entity110 raid			0
however , @entity7 officials are billing it as a major achievement for the @entity112			2
president @entity113 trumpeted the victory , saying that @entity46 will face ' the full weight of @entity7 justice			2
' ' it 's important for us to send a message to the world that when @entity7 are attacked , no matter how long it takes , we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice , ' he said before a speech on manufacturing in @entity124 on tuesday			2
one source told the @entity45 that @entity46 's capture is ' a reminder that when the @entity7 says it ’s going to hold someone accountable and he will face justice , this is what we mean			2
' the @entity112 would not comment on why he was captured now - nearly a year after he was indicted			0
however , the @entity97 cites a source who suggests that @entity113 lacked the legal authority to send troops into @entity4 unilaterally because @entity46 did n't have links to @entity136			1
only recently have investigators found links between him and the terrorists who attacked the @entity7 in 2001			1
the time , however , is a victory that comes at a bad time for president @entity113 foreign policy			0
the return of prisoner of war @entity146 in exchange for five @entity150 detainees and the rise of a violent sectarian uprising in @entity153 have had @entity113 on a back footing			0
national tragedy : @entity6 , who succumbed to smoke inhalation after the attack , was the first @entity7 ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 former @entity161 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) were working as @entity164 security contractors when they were killed defending from a second wave of the attack @entity167 , an it specialist for the @entity168 , was also killed in the attack @entity6 , the first @entity7 ambassador killed in the line of duty since 1979 , died of smoke inhalation after the terrorist attackers set fire to the @entity7 compound			1
@entity167 , a 34 - year - old computer system manager with the @entity168 was also killed			0
former @entity161 and @entity176 , who were working as @entity7 security contractors for the @entity164 , died in the second wave of the attack as they defended the adjacent @entity164 building after mounting a rescue mission			1
@entity112 spokesman @entity182 would not comment on where @entity183 would be held as he awaits trial - whether it would be in a federal facility or the detention center at @entity189 , @entity190			0
officials told the @entity45 that he would likely remain on the @entity53 ship to be interrogated by military and intelligence agents			0
then a ' clean team ' would be brought in to give him his @entity197 and question him in a manner that could be used at a federal trial			0
the 2012 @entity3 attack has been a major political liability for the @entity112 and for then - secretary of state @entity203			1
@entity204 have launched numerous official investigations and alleged that officials botched security at the consulate and ignored @entity6 ' request for more guards			2
they also claim @entity212 officials tried to over up the real motive for the terrorist attack - claiming at the time that it was a riot over an @entity217 video - to improve @entity113 's reelection chances			0
the @entity219 recently established a select committee , nearly two years after the incident , to formally review the handling of the run - up to and aftermath of the assault			0
president @entity113 : ' with this operation , the @entity7 has once again demonstrated that we will do whatever it takes to see that justice is done when people harm @entity7			2
we will continue our efforts to bring to justice those who were responsible for the @entity3 attacks			2
' secretary of state @entity235 : ' this weekend , that work took a dramatic step forward			0
@entity238 , an alleged key leader of the attacks in @entity3 , is now in @entity7 custody			1
he will face a court of law and be held accountable for his actions			0
this bold action by the superb @entity7 military is a clear reminder to anyone who dares do us harm that they will not escape with impunity			0
' senator @entity250 , @entity204 of @entity251 : ' @entity238 has been openly defying the @entity7 for more than twenty months			0
now that he is in custody , the proper authorities should be given ample time to assess what intelligence he may have about ongoing terrorist operations against @entity7			0
@entity238 is a foreign terrorist , captured by our special forces overseas for his violent attack on a @entity7 facility			1
he belongs in @entity150 and in the military justice system , not in the @entity7 civilian court system with the constitutional protections afforded @entity7 citizens			0
' congressman @entity265 , @entity204 of @entity266 and @entity268 chairman : ' this is overdue , considering that this individual has made himself available to multiple media outlets in the 19 months since the deaths of four @entity7 , including the first @entity7 ambassador killed in an attack since 1979			1
i hope that this capture brings us closer to justice and accountability			0
we should right now be getting from him as much intelligence as possible			0
' senator @entity282 , @entity283 of @entity266 and @entity285 chairman : ' i fully support the administration ’s efforts to gather intelligence from @entity238 and prosecute him in federal court			0
past cases against terrorists like @entity238 have shown that we can obtain intelligence , convict terrorists and lock them away for a very long time			0
the @entity7 criminal justice system has successfully convicted over 500 terrorists since 9/11 , and i have full confidence in the ability of our federal courts			0
