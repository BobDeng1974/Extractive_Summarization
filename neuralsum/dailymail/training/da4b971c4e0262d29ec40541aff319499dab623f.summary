by @entity0 glassy - eyed and bare - chested as he clutches a drink in a nightclub , @entity2 cricketer @entity1 looks as though he is celebrating a fantastic victory			1
but the photograph was taken just hours after @entity2 had failed to defeat @entity7 on sunday , leaving followers of the national team lamenting a string of nine successive test matches without victory – the longest run for more than 20 years			1
the 24 - year - old batsman was later carried out of the bar in @entity16 after telling incredulous fans : ‘ i ’m not a cricketer tonight			1
i ’m just a drunken b * * * * * d. ’ topless : @entity2 batsman @entity1 ( left ) was seen knocking back shots and posing for photos without his top on in @entity26 nightclub in @entity16 just hours after drawing a test match against @entity7 the @entity29 - educated sports star later shouted that he was ‘ absolutely f * * * ed ’			1
his drunken antics emerged after photographs surfaced of @entity2 footballers larking about with champagne and cigars after their failure to win a game in the @entity38 finals in @entity39			2
goalkeeper @entity40 was pictured apparently spitting drink into the mouth of @entity44 ’s midfield star @entity43 who was also seen smoking a cigarette and cigar in a @entity48 pool			1
with pundits and fans still discussing how far @entity2 have fallen – and why – in both football and cricket , it seems that some of our top players are rather less concerned			0
@entity1 – who had a fine innings in the game , scoring 71 runs – was joined in @entity16 ’s @entity26 club on sunday after close of play at @entity62 by teammates @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
off the field antics : other people inside the club said they heard the @entity71 player shouting : ' i 'm not a cricketer tonight , i 'm just a drunken b * * * * * d ' on the pitch : @entity1 scored 71 in the first innings of the match at @entity62 which ended in a draw it was reported that @entity80 bought large vodkas for a group of girls and tipped the bar staff £ 20 – and put on a drunken dancing display for punters who watched him knocking back drinks until closing time			1
‘ they had to carry him out at the end of the night , ’ said one witness			2
‘ he was standing outside with his top off screaming “ @entity2 ! @entity2 ! @entity2 ! ’ ’ ’ his behaviour was all the more surprising because @entity2 have to start another five - day test match against @entity7 this morning			1
the players had been given permission to go out on sunday night ahead of a rest day on monday			0
but his boisterous ‘ re-fuelling ’ will have angered many cricket fans who are desperately hoping that @entity2 can end their winless streak when the @entity101 starts at @entity102 ’s today			2
senior figures in the @entity105 will also be unimpressed , as they do not need yet another headache			0
@entity107 is facing a ban from @entity109 after being charged by cricket chiefs with pushing @entity7 player @entity111			2
last night @entity2 team coach @entity112 appeared to be taking a lenient approach to @entity80 – at least in public			0
no repercussions : the @entity105 , cricket 's governing body , issued a statement saying they were aware @entity80 had been out drinking , but said he would not face any disciplinary action because he had n't broken any curfews @entity2 's finest : the pictures of the cricketer emerged just days after footballer @entity43 was caught smoking in a @entity48 swimming pool			0
he went on holiday with friends after a dismal @entity38 performance mouth - to - mouth : he was also seen messing with goalkeeper @entity40 , surrounded by bikini - clad women venue : witnesses said @entity1 had to be carried from @entity26 in @entity16 at the end of the night he said : ‘ as the players had been released at the end of the first test and were not due to meet up to begin preparations for the second test until monday evening , and there were no suggestions of impropriety , there is no need for any disciplinary action			1
i will however be reminding all players of their responsibilities to uphold the best possible image for @entity2 cricket			0
’ @entity112 ’ apparent leniency follows that of team captain @entity154 who last month defended players @entity64 and @entity156 after they were spotted stumbling out of a @entity158 nightclub			0
‘ that ’s just an age thing , ’ said @entity154			0
‘ having a night out with a few of the boys is fine			0
’ as the @entity2 management team were looking after the public fall - out from the episode , there was no comment from @entity80 last night .			0

the batsman was pictured holding up a drink in @entity26 , @entity16
was heard shouting : ' i 'm not a cricketer tonight . i 'm just a drunken b * * * * * d '
witnesses said he was knocking back shots and *buying* drinks for others
is then said to have been carried from the bar at the end of the evening
