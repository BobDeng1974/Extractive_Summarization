the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation , but people in this @entity7 city are n't surprised			1
they call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check			0
there is almost nothing in @entity18 's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light			1
people in the community he served say this reflects what 's going wrong with policing today : officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain			2
above , a friend of @entity37 's at a memorial the officer who shot @entity37 , @entity42 , had little in his file to suggest excessive force			1
above , two men pray at the memorial ' we 've had through the years numerous similar complaints , and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation , ' the rev. @entity47 , vice president of the @entity35 branch of the @entity49 , said thursday			1
the mostly black neighborhood in @entity55 where @entity18 fired eight shots at the back of @entity58 on saturday is far from unique in this regard , said @entity60 , a former @entity61 agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases			1
@entity67 , training that pushes pre-emptive action , military experience that creates a warzone mindset , and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies , he said			0
' it 's not just training			2
it 's not just unreasonable fear			0
it 's not just the warrior mentality			0
it 's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it			0
it is not just race , ' @entity60 said			0
' it is all of that			0
' both @entity18 , 33 , and @entity37 , 55 , were @entity91 veteran			1
@entity18 had the dismissed excessive force complaint and @entity37 had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support , but neither man had a record of violence			1
video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed @entity18 fire eight shots at the back of @entity37 as he ran away original statements from @entity18 said that he felt threatened by @entity37 , though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident a dash cam video from police shows @entity37 running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light @entity18 consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the @entity113			1
his new attorney , @entity114 , said thursday that he 's conducting his own investigation , and that it 's ' far too early for us to be saying what we think			1
' @entity18 's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force , but swiftly dropped him after the dead man 's family released a bystander 's video of the shooting			1
the officer , whose wife is eight months pregnant , is being held without bond pending an august 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted			0
a steady crowd left flowers , stuffed animals , notes and protest signs thursday in the empty lot where @entity37 was gunned down			0
many said police in @entity7 's third - largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment , even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior			1
@entity37 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) were both @entity91 veterans			1
@entity18 is being held without bond on a murder charge @entity152 version police officer @entity42 said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with @entity37 began at around 9.30am on saturday			1
he said he pulled @entity37 's @entity155 over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light			0
he said @entity37 then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where , at some point during the chase , the victim confronts @entity18			2
the officer then tried to use his taser to subdue @entity37 , but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle , according to the statement			0
according to police reports , @entity18 fired the stun gun , but it did not stop @entity37			2
at that point , the officer fired at @entity37 several times because he ' felt threatened , ' @entity18 's statement said			1
he added that his actions were in line with procedure			0
police then said @entity18 reported on his radio moments after the struggle : ' shots fired and the subject is down			2
' his department said the officers then performed cpr and delivered first aid to the victim			0
what the video shows @entity18 's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting @entity37 in the back			1
the footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after @entity18 fires his taser			2
wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from @entity37 's body			0
as @entity37 turns to run , @entity18 draws his pistol and , only when he is 15 to 20 feet away , starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back			2
the video shows @entity18 handcuffing @entity37 's lifeless body			1
footage then appears to show @entity18 jogging back to the point where the @entity163 fell to the ground , bringing it over to @entity37 's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him			1
it is only after two - and - a - half minutes that @entity18 is seen placing his hand on @entity37 's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse			1
a black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body , but is not seen performing first aid			0
they are joined by a third officer , who also does not appear to tend to the victim			0
the result , they say , is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear			0
@entity18 's file includes a single excessive use - of - force complaint , from 2013 : a man said @entity18 used his stun gun against him without reason			1
but @entity18 was exonerated and the case closed , even though witnesses told @entity233 that investigators never followed up with them			2
' it 's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation , ' @entity60 said / ' @entity238 of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated			2
number two , there 's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers			0
' @entity249 , the man who accused @entity18 of excessive force in 2013 , told the @entity233 that @entity18 woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door , and saying ' come outside or i 'll tase you ! ' ' i did n't want that to happen to me , so i raised my arms over my head , and when i did , he tased me in my stomach anyway , ' @entity249 said			1
@entity249 ( pictured ) filed an excessive force complaint against @entity18 in 2013 , but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned ' they never told me how they reached the conclusion			1
they never contacted anyone from that night			0
no one from the neighborhood			0
' @entity249 said he 's convinced @entity37 's death could have been prevented if @entity18 had been disciplined in his case			1
' if they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night , this man might be alive today , ' he said			0
@entity47 also wonders if saturday 's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 @entity163 complaint			1
' i think he would have been rebuked instead of fired , ' @entity47 said			0
' but maybe it changes the way he sees things			0
' @entity47 and other civil rights leaders want @entity55 to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police , since ' law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt			0
' such boards are few and far between in @entity7			2
@entity55 police spokesman @entity288 said wednesday that the department now plans to review @entity249 ' complaint , although he would n't say what difference that could make now .			2

officer @entity42 's file has little to suggest use of excessive force
