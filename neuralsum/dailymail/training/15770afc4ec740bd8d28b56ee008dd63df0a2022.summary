mr @entity3 had received a fine from the parking company and sent it back with a letter explaining , on the advice of @entity14			1
he then moved house assuming the matter was closed but a series of letters were sent to his old address and he was then made the subject of a court order			0
' at this time of year we are using a lot of credit because people are trying to pawn their things ahead of @entity44 , ' said mr @entity3 of @entity45 in @entity46			2
' this has absolutely stuffed me			0
i have lost my credibility and lost two of my oldest clients who have been doing business with me for more than 20 years			0

but he was stunned two weeks later when he received a fine from @entity58			0
mr @entity3 phoned the hotel who said he did n't have to pay and advised him to send the ticket back with a letter explaining the mix up			1
the shop owner followed their instructions but later moved to a new property five miles away thinking the matter was closed			0
mr @entity3 parked his £ 30,000 @entity18 at the hotel car park and was told he would not need to pay parking charges mr @entity3 parked his car at the @entity14 hotel in @entity78 while he enjoyed a business lunch and was told he could park for free as long as he spent a minimum £ 35 - but days later he was sent a ticket this summer he realised something was amiss when he was rejected for credit from three different banks			1
he investigated and found he had a poor credit rating because @entity58 had taken out a county court judgement for the unpaid ticket			1
' at the moment we are n't making hay while the sun shines , ; ' he added			0
' it is a bit like going to the restaurant getting a bad meal and then asking people to come back again			0
' it is awful because normally at this time of year we are getting good stock in but now we are just recycling all our old stock			0
' we have been in business over 40 years and we have got loyal customers but it is damaging the reputation of the company i have worked so hard to build			0
' one parking ticket could have cost me between £ 30,000 or £ 40,000			1

' he said his pawn broker shop is struggling and he has lost around £ 40,000 because he was unknowingly made the subject of a county court judgement and denied credit because of the unpaid parking ticket despite the fact he had changed his address with the @entity119 the correspondence over the matter had already been set to his previous home			1
@entity123 have admitted they are wrong and claim they have applied for the judgement to be withdrawn			2
a spokesman said : ' we are sorry to hear about the parking fines that have been received by mr @entity3			2
' @entity15 does offer a parking waiver to guests visiting the hotel restaurant , with a minimum spend			2
in these instances we ask guests to enter their registration number at the hotel reception			0
' once a guest receives a parking ticket , we suggest that they contact @entity141 if they wish to appeal			2
' @entity142 has confirmed to us that no letter of appeal was received from mr @entity3			2
' @entity58 , which operates the car park said : '' unfortunately our records indicate that mr @entity3 did not appeal his parking charge			1
' @entity58 then pursues all available avenues before initiating court action , sending at least three further letters to the motorist including documentation on how to appeal to the industry 's independent appeals service ( which is completed at @entity58 's cost ) prior to issuing any court claim			2
@entity58 relies , not unreasonably , on address information supplied to it by the @entity119 as this information is supplied , in turn , by the registered keeper of the vehicle			0
' the company said they had since applied to have the @entity163 set aside , at their own cost .			0
