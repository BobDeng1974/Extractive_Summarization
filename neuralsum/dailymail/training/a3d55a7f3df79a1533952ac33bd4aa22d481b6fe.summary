by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it will forever be known as the @entity3 in @entity4 but its architect @entity5 always thinks of another classic war film , when he recalls the unlikely tale			1
' we were going to a game and the lads were watching the @entity11 when it dawned on me , ' said @entity13			1
' i was on the bus in charge of this motley crew of players , cast - offs			2
no - one else wanted them			2
we could n’t get anyone else			0
' we were bottom of the @entity22 and i just went for hardest characters i could find			0
all those i ’d hated playing against , those i knew were tough but had reputations for being hard to handle			0
i thought in a dog - fight , you need personality			2
' the @entity11 : @entity5 helped @entity30 avoid relegation from the @entity22 in 1999 come along way : @entity30 take on @entity33 in the @entity35 final at @entity36 on saturday evening it was 1998			1
a few months earlier , @entity33 had completed the @entity37 , winning the @entity35 at @entity36 at the end of @entity40 ’s first full season in @entity41			1
@entity30 had ended the same campaign 90 rungs down the ladder , the third worst team in @entity22 , the new following season , things got worse			1
they were nine points adrift at the bottom of @entity50 in november when @entity13 , the club captain was asked to take over as player - caretaker - manager			1
it would get worse before it got better			0
crisis does not begin to explain the pit of trouble : plunging towards extinction , begging favours for training facilities and transport , with supporters in revolt and yet another bitter ownership struggle unfolding			0
somehow , this bunch of renegades stayed up			0
' the football was very , very basic , ' said @entity13			1
' we had to simplify the game - plan			2
it was built on running power , fitness and a few counter-attacks but we had spirit			0
differing fortunes : @entity33 won the double just a few months before @entity30 were rooted to the bottom ' i remember standing in the tunnel and i ’d see people wilt when they lined up against us			1
it was so loud and my lot would be staring them down			0
i could tell when they did n’t fancy it			0
they were a scary bunch but their discipline and self - control was good			2
' they knew this was their chance			0
most had been dumped by clubs a lot smaller than @entity30			1
and the common bond was no - one wanted to go out of the @entity22			2
we won a game at @entity98 and we were n’t officially safe but we knew we were staying up			0
that trip back was unbelievable			2
' @entity13 was appointed permanent player - manager and within a year of the escape act had been sacked			1
that ’s gratitude football - style			0
he had kept @entity30 in the @entity22			1
he stopped the rot and like the @entity106 has not looked back , forging a reputation as a successful development coach , first at @entity109 and then @entity110 , where he is reserve team coach			1
there was a two - year spell in charge of @entity115 , in @entity116 , but he has otherwise resisted offers to return to management			0
he was linked with a return to @entity30 when @entity120 left in 2011			1
present day : @entity13 has forged a reputation as a successful development coach and is working at @entity110 @entity13 coached at @entity110 ’s @entity123 when he was still playing , having acquired his coaching qualifications in his mid-twenties			2
it was in his blood			0
his father @entity129 also devoted his life to football as a player and coach			0
@entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 were all nurtured by @entity13 in his role as youth team manager at @entity109 and many more at @entity139 , including @entity140 , who scored twice on his @entity110 debut against @entity30			1
no - one in the @entity143 city will hold it against him			0
his hero status is assured as the man who inspired @entity30 ’s revival from rock bottom of the @entity22 to the first @entity35 final in the club ’s 110 - year history .			1

@entity5 *rescued* @entity30 from *oblivion* during his stint as the @entity106 ' player - manager back in 1999
saturday ***'s*** @entity35 final *opponents* @entity33 were *celebrating* the double during @entity30 ***'s*** struggles 15 years *ago*
@entity13 is a hero on @entity161 having inspired @entity30 ***'s*** revival
