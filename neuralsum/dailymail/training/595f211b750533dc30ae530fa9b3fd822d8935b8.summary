by @entity0 the battle of the instant messaging apps has taken a twist today after reports claim @entity5 is working on a @entity7 rival			1
the tech giant - which famously tried to buy @entity7 earlier this year - already has its own messenger app , but rumours suggest it is planning to release a video - chat service , called @entity12 , later this month			1
like @entity7 , @entity12 would let users send short video messages by tapping the screen after selecting one or several contacts from their list of @entity5 friends			1
@entity5 founder @entity20 ( pictured ) is said to be preparing to take the site into a video - messaging war with rivals @entity7 and @entity24			1
rumours suggest the company has been working on a video - sharing app called @entity12 - and it might be released later this month the move comes as both @entity24 and @entity7 have attempted to eat away at @entity5 ’s share of the messaging market with their @entity32 updates respectively			1
it ’s no secret that some of the world ’s biggest social networks are now locked in an instant messaging war			0
a month ago @entity24 announced a messaging ability for its popular video - sharing service , dubbed @entity32			1
and a few weeks ago @entity7 unveiled chat , allowing users to send messages to each other on the app for the first time			2
@entity5 ’s newest update would be a strike back at its rivals			0
the rumours claim @entity20 and his team have been working on the idea for several months , as @entity5 attempts to separate various services out into different apps rather than combining them into one			2
back in february , @entity5 bought hugely popular messaging app @entity54 for $ 14.6 billion ( £ 8.7 billion ) , after failing in a previous $ 3 billion ( £ 1.8 billion ) bid to buy @entity7			1
at the start of april , @entity24 revealed its @entity59 service that lets users send messages to each other			1
this directly followed once - popular social network @entity65 ’s attempts to get back into the game with @entity67 , their own video messaging service			0
at the start of may , @entity7 then unveiled ' chat ' , a messaging service within the app that enabled users to send messages that , like photos and videos , are deleted after they 're seen			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , is busy trying to increase the profile of its @entity78 app , with rumours that it will shift @entity54 users onto its native messaging client			2
they recently announced a selfie feature for messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself			0
and even @entity89 is getting in on the game – it ’s rumoured they are considering letting users have secret conversations on the site			0
slingshot is a direct response to @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) , both of which were released in the last month in an attempt to draw users away from @entity100 and @entity54 talking to the @entity102 , sources said the app could be launched this month - although , as of yet there ’s no official word from @entity5			1
the move would follow @entity20 ’s unsuccessful attempt to purchase @entity7 in late 2013 for $ 3 billion ( £ 1.8 billion )			0
instead , earlier this year @entity5 bought @entity54 for a whopping $ 14.6 billion ( £ 8.7 billion ) in cash and stock			0
despite the purchase , the move to provide users with simple ways to communicate is seen as a necessity as @entity5 faces competition on all fronts			2
aside from the big - hitters a number of other apps like @entity119 and @entity120 are threatening to eat away at the @entity123 - based company			0
@entity5 acquired @entity54 earlier this year for $ 14.6 billion ( £ 8.7 billion ) in cash and stock to complement its existing @entity100 service			0
further rumours suggest the company is planning to migrate all @entity54 users onto @entity100 this is n’t the first time @entity5 has made moves in these markets though			2
earlier this year they quietly removed two unpopular services on the @entity133 – @entity134 and @entity135			0
the former , building on the once popular feature of its main website , was very similar to @entity7 and allowed users to send each other brief video messages			2
the latter , meanwhile , was an attempt to rival @entity143 and provide photographers with a means to applying filters to and editing their images .			0

sources claim @entity5 could release a video - messaging app ' this month '
dubbed @entity12 , it would be a direct competitor to @entity7 and @entity24
it would enable users to send brief videos to friends in a *standalone* app
move comes as @entity5 *'s* rivals revealed their own messaging services
@entity59 and @entity165 both threaten @entity100
