mr @entity6 has decided to speak out because he believes it is important to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse			1
retired @entity32 manager mr @entity6 said : ' being attacked by a woman is nothing to be ashamed of			1
' ' i had never imagined something like this would happen to me			0
' as a man who is a bit older and who is n't exactly small , there is a perception that you ca n't be a victim of domestic violence			0
' i was worried that people would assume that it was my fault and she was the victim - there is still a general perception that , as a strong man against a weaker female , you must have been the protagonist			0

pictured , injuries to his back ( left ) and shoulder ( right ) ' but it should be the same message that they put out for women many years ago : do n't be frightened , you do n't have to put up with it			2
' the couple met through ballroom dancing following the death of mr @entity6 's first wife of more than 30 years , @entity77 , seven years ago			1
but after five years of marriage , their relationship soured			0
on the day of the attack on march 23 , mr @entity6 had been due to take flowers to his late wife 's memorial to mark her birthday			1
instead the couple rowed over finances and household chores			0
eventually , they reached an apparently mutual decision to get a divorce and @entity19 had offered to make a cup of tea			0
mr @entity6 , who has limited mobility due to arthritis , turned down the offer , but his wife left the room and returned with a jug of freshly boiled water			1
@entity11 @entity101 heard she told him ' there you go ' after tipping it over his head without warning			0
it was the culmination of escalating verbal abuse			0
three weeks earlier , mr @entity6 needed hospital treatment after @entity19 threw a cup of tea over him while he slept , in what she claimed was an accident			1
when police arrived following the final incident , mr @entity6 said she told officers : ' if i 'd wanted to kill him , i 'd have used a knife			1
' reliving the incident , mr @entity6 said : ' i was sitting with my back to her and it came without warning			1
' it was unbearable , searing pain - i 'd never known anything like it			0
' afterwards i could barely sleep as i could n't lie on my back			2
' mr @entity6 , who has limited mobility due to arthritis , said the injuries meant he barely sleep after the attack experts told the trial that the pattern of the injuries showed the water must have been poured deliberately - and not by accident			1
mr @entity6 said : ' from the start , the police took it very seriously and even our mutual friends were able to see that i was the innocent party			2
' if other men find themselves in this position , i would say do n't be embarrassed or ashamed - my case goes to show that this can happen to anybody			2
' detective inspector @entity148 , from @entity150 's domestic abuse unit , said the force has specially - trained officers who support both male and female victims of domestic violence			2
he said : ' men affected by domestic abuse often feel that they wo n't be taken seriously , but this simply is n't the case			0
' @entity19 will be sentenced on march 24 after being found guilty earlier this month .			2
