it 's the original free love community where women rule the roost : welcome to the gorgeous @entity3 in the @entity4 where the ladies can have as many lovers as they please and marriages are sealed with a gift of yams and polished stone			1
and as you 'd expect from a place where free love rules the roost , conflicts on the islands , which are officially part of @entity14 , are settled over marathon games of cricket in which even girls can take part			1
but , as photographer @entity26 reveals , their easygoing attitude to sex has come at a price			1
' @entity28 have a relaxed approach to sex before and even after marriage , ' he explains			0
' girls learn about contraception very early and virginity has no value at all			0
carrying cash : along with yams , dried banana leaves are currency on the island			1
according to @entity26 , this little girl 's leaves are the equivalent of a bundle of £ 10 notes chief : mr @entity47 is the head of @entity50 village and always carries betel nuts , lime gourds and spatulas			2
the spatula is made from bird bone but human used to be used customs : little girls always wear garlands of fresh flowers on their heads while right , a widow , distinguishable by her shaved head , smiles for @entity26 's camera ' if a girl gets pregnant , her family keeps the baby , because , according to the local custom , men just help to open up the woman to pregnancy - the real father is a @entity74 or spirit			2
' although more and more islanders are attending school , attitudes to sex remain the same			2
' @entity81 education changed some islander 's point of view , but not all of them , ' explains @entity26			0
' relationships between married couples do n't have much in common with what happens in @entity88 : here [ in the @entity3 ] a man is supposed to give presents to his wife in return for the sexual favours			2
' unfortunately , the @entity28 relaxed approach to sex and relationships has left them vulnerable to @entity98 and @entity99 - a disease which is known to locals as ' the sickness without medicine ' and has ravaged some communities			2
but , says @entity26 , even the malign presence of the disease is n't enough to persuade the islanders to give up their traditional way of life			2
traditional : @entity110 wear red grass skirts unique to the islands for ceremonies and weddings			2
completing the look are traditional feathered headbands in charge : girls are encouraged to take part in ' battles ' and dance topless , with most choosing to wear red grass skirts , shells , feathers and fresh flowers elaborate : the skirts worn by the women are made from dried grass , while necklaces and bracelets are made from shells			0
men wear cockatoo feather headdresses permissive : trobriand teenagers are encouraged to experiment with different lovers and a special hut , right , is set aside in every village for them to use ' despite the fact that @entity98 and @entity99 spreads quickly through the island population , premarital sex remains a part of the islanders ’ idyllic lifestyle , ' continues @entity26			1
all villages are home to a special hut called a bukumatula which is set aside especially for unmarried teenagers and their lovers , although condoms and other types of contraceptive are nowhere to be found			1
there is , however , one sort of person to whom the @entity110 ' amorous behaviour does n't apply			2
' the romantic customs of the @entity110 do not extend to " outsiders " , ' explains @entity26			1
' the locals are very proud people and they value their genetic lines			0
' discovered by the @entity164 in 1793 , the islands were named after @entity165 , a lieutenant on the @entity167 ship , @entity166 , but remained untouched until a @entity169 missionary moved in in 1894			0
he was followed in the 1930s by a @entity171 but the islanders , although ruled by first the @entity174 and then the @entity175 , clung firm to their traditional ways			0
education : despite the influence of @entity181 teachers , the majority of @entity110 continue to take a relaxed approach to sex and relationships chief 's family : the house of the chieftain is recognisable by its height , shell decorations and the presence of a malagan - a carved , painted totem pole changing times : although some modern items such as musical instruments have been embraced , islanders cling to many traditions , including keeping pigs as pets is that a googly ? cricket is hugely popular and was introduced by colonial authorities			1
banned from going to war , the islanders settle their differences with a game home sweet home : in @entity210 village , the many thatched huts are built on stilts around a central square , which is known to locals as the @entity214 now part of @entity14 , the @entity3 continue to live much as they always have , using yams as currency and operating a matriarchal system that sees children become part of their mother 's clan rather than the other way around			1
they also settle scores and disputes by playing cricket , which was introduced by colonial authorities after they banned tribes from going to war with each other			1
' a cricket game is always the occasion for mocking remarks and challenges between villages			0
it is played with much whistle blowing , singing and dancing , ' explains @entity26			0
' girls also take part in these " battles " and dance topless , only wearing grass skirts and flowers			0
they also adopt very suggestive poses , which would probably come as a shock to the authorities who introduced it			0
' dances always take place after lengthy reconciliation ceremonies , with those taking part putting a mixture of coconut oil , mint and lemongrass on their bodies			0
' he adds : ' i was invited to join the circle of dancers who then took a sadistic pleasure in making fun of my hairy legs			0
i had no hope with the girls here because they do n’t like white skin and hair — it 's something they see as a sign of ugliness and scruffiness			1
the dim dim ( the white man ) is not their beauty ideal			0
' magic : although many , among them seven - year - old @entity281 , go to school , the @entity110 continue to believe in magic and believe it is responsible for conception important : because yams are a sign of wealth , yam houses - huts where the tubers are stored - are very important			1
those belonging to chiefs are highly decorated delicate : teenage girls wear tortoiseshell earrings which they eventually pass on to their daughters , while traditional kula boats come covered in cowrie shells jewellery : most of the @entity110 sport elaborate bracelets and necklaces , all of which are made from natural materials such as shells , stones and feathers rare : because the islands are coral atolls , anything made from stone is considered rare and valuable			0
this stone was polished and given as a wedding gift excitement : the weekly flight from @entity315 , capital of @entity14 , is the most exciting moment of the week for many and draws huge crowds war : during @entity322 , thousands of @entity321 soldiers were stationed on the @entity3			1
vintage dog tags can be picked up for as little as 20p remote : the idyllic islands are home to the @entity110 , who still live in much the same way as they always have - including fishing from wooden canoes paradise : the remote @entity3 are a tiny knot of coral atolls surrounded by the @entity333 and just off the east coast of @entity14			1

the @entity3 are in the @entity333 and are officially a part of @entity14
islanders have an easygoing attitude to sex and encourage both men and women to take lovers
most villages have a special hut called a bukumatula which is used for *extramarital* encounters
babies are thought to be the result of magic with no link between sex and pregnancy
their romantic customs do n't extend to outsiders : they consider white skin and hair ugly
other customs include using yams and banana leaves as currency - £ 1 is equivalent to 50 leaves
@entity110 were forbidden from *fighting* by colonial authorities so ' war ' is now cricket
