exclusive by @entity1 he was dubbed @entity3 ’s first paparazzo , and was so loathed by the @entity4 that prince @entity5 suggested sending him to the @entity6			2
@entity7 - ‘ that bloody @entity9 ! ’ , as princess @entity8 used to call him - was a constant presence at royal events in the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , taking candid shots of the @entity16 and her family			1
ironically , even those deemed his most ‘ controversial ’ are unlikely to raise an eyebrow today , but in those rather more deferential times , @entity9 was a thorn in the monarchy ’s side , shooting the @entity16 relaxing on family picnics , prince @entity26 waterskiing and @entity27 as a young bathing belle			1
one ¿ s family seat : prince @entity26 in june 1970 whizzing across the lake at @entity31 on a chair balanced on a table on the water : @entity26 tries his hand at more conventional waterskiing			1
the photograph was taken by @entity7 - ' that bloody @entity9 ! ' , as princess @entity8 used to call him now aged 77 , @entity9 is putting his entire 23,000 - strong catalogue and its copyright up for auction in aid of charity			1
it is hoped the collection will raise upwards of £ 500,000			0
among the many interested parties , it is rumoured , are those with connections to the @entity4 who wish to buy up the lot to take them out of circulation			0
it was the year after the young @entity16 was crowned — 1954 — that the 18 - year - old novice photographer , the son of @entity56 immigrant ice cream sellers , took a picture of her sheltering under an umbrella that was published by several newspapers			1
@entity9 realised he was on to something and decided to concentrate his efforts on the @entity4 , but seek something different from the rest of the press pack			1
‘ it was a business decision , nothing more , nothing less , ’ he recalls from his home in @entity67			0
‘ i used a mixture of common sense and contacts			0
of course i got tip - offs , but i also thought about things very laterally			2
’ @entity9 used to infuriate prince @entity5 , who frequently remonstrated with the photographer in the coarsest of terms , also ensuring that he was blacklisted by most @entity79 newspapers ( although his pictures were published abroad )			1
it goes like this , ma'am : @entity16 ( left ) dances the twist with a friend in a rare unguarded moment at @entity87 in august 1962 the innings and outs of a royal childhood : prince @entity91 bowling in a game of cricket in @entity94 , west @entity3 , in july 1967 some of his photographs , such as the one of prince @entity26 sitting on a chair while waterskiing on the lake at @entity31 , @entity98 , show a fun side to the @entity100 , rarely seen in public			1
' i used a mixture of common sense and contacts			0
of course i got tip - offs , but i also thought about things very laterally ' @entity7 @entity9 had been standing on a footpath by the lake when he was approached by @entity8 ’s then husband , @entity110 , who told him : ‘ if you hang on we ’ll do something that will really make your pictures			1
keep an eye out for the chair ! ’ bemused , he waited and soon prince @entity26 came whizzing past , sitting on an old chair , which had been balanced on an upturned table , with grinning @entity110 at the wheel of the speedboat			1
other images , however , capture some truly historic moments — such as the @entity16 meeting with her supposedly estranged uncle , the @entity127 , who had come to @entity3 in 1965 for eye surgery			2
the ‘ grey suits ’ at @entity136 , as courtiers are often known , publicly and emphatically denied that she had any plans to meet her uncle , given the family ’s continuing bitterness over his 1936 abdication			0
costume dramas : @entity27 ( left ) suns herself in @entity139 and @entity26 ( right ) cycles in @entity141 as a student , both in 1969 on the ball : a kickabout for @entity91 ( centre ) in 1967			1
@entity7 is putting his entire 23,000 - strong catalogue and its copyright up for auction in aid of charity the photographer said : ‘ the information that i had received , however , was that he was going to the @entity136 every day to walk in the gardens as part of his recuperation , so i rang the palace once again			1
“ mr @entity9 , ” said the secretary , “ how can she be meeting him if there is no contact between them whatsoever ? ” ‘ i hired a room on the 19th floor of the @entity166 on @entity167 , which overlooks the palace gardens , and dusted off my longest lens			2
' sure enough , one afternoon i saw the @entity127 walking out around the gardens , followed a few yards behind by the @entity16 with her corgis scampering around her legs			2
the picture was used in @entity174 as no @entity79 newspaper would touch it			0
’ eventually , @entity9 tired of his fights with the @entity100 and went abroad , earning plaudits for his work covering conflicts in @entity180 , the @entity181 and the @entity182			2
his work inspired him to set up a charity , @entity184			0
the auction will fund its work providing a free legal service for those without the means to seek help , including the disabled and victims of domestic violence			0

@entity9 used to infuriate prince @entity5 he says : ‘ i am sad to be relinquishing my collection , much of which has not been seen in public before , but it is in aid of a cause about which i am passionate and will , i hope , live long after i am gone			1
' whoever buys it ( my collection ) will be securing a piece of history ' @entity7 ‘ for the past 40 years , it has been secretly moved from place to place			2
whoever buys it will be securing a piece of history			0
’ @entity213 , from auctioneers @entity214 , which is organising the sale , adds : ‘ this is a truly remarkable collection and we expect there will be significant interest worldwide			0
it is such a unique collection , with nothing ever having come up for sale previously to compare it to			0
‘ we expect the collection to achieve somewhere in the region of between £ 500,000 and £ 1million			0
’ @entity227 is holding the sale in @entity3 on october 10 , although private offers for the collection — which includes thousands of pictures of other public figures such as @entity233 , @entity234 and the @entity236 family — are also being invited .			0
