by @entity0 this is the moment a pair of daredevil skydivers set a new base jump world record by leaping 2,717 feet off the tallest building in the world			1
veteran base jumpers @entity8 and @entity9 prepared for their record breaking leap from @entity13 's @entity12 tower by spending time up a @entity15 mountain to acclimatise to the altitude			1
the men are not the first to base jump from the top of the tower - which is roughly twice the height of @entity22 's @entity21 - but they had a special platform built to add an extra 500 feet , enabling them to break the world record			1
the pair had to practice on a @entity15 mountain to get used to the altitude a spine - tingling video shows the two base jumpers dive from the world 's tallest building and plummet towards the ground , before eventually pulling the chord on their parachutes and landing safely			1
to ensure they were used to the altitude , @entity8 and @entity9 practiced base jumping from a mountain near @entity58 in @entity15 , which is roughly the same height as the @entity12 tower			2
the pair also made several jumps from helicopters in @entity13 ahead of their record breaking effort in order to ensure they would not be distracted by the famous skyline			0
no fear : the daredevil duo steady themselves for their record breaking base jump earlier today prepared : @entity8 and @entity9 are not the first to base jump from the @entity12 tower but had a special platform built to add an extra 50 feet , thereby enabling them to break the world base jump record do n't look down : the @entity12 tower in @entity13 is the tallest building in the world at 2,723 feet after jumping from the tower , @entity8 said : ' this was the jump of a lifetime and an achievement of three years of hard training			1

i am glad we landed successfully , accomplishing a lifelong dream ' , he added			0
his skydiving partner @entity9 said : ' this was my best jump by far			0
it was a dream come true			0
' the record breaking leap was only possible with the construction of a three by one meter platform at the very top of the pinnacle , which was incredibly difficult to build			2
the structure took a total of three days to install , with challenging weather conditions limiting the time available for construction			0
@entity13 , who organised the record breaking jump , celebrated by posting a video of it on their @entity114 page			2
in a statement , they added : ' this success is due to the ' practice make perfect ' method of training that we always follow and the 100 per cent dedication of everyone working on this project			0
' @entity8 and @entity9 are veteran base jumpers and members of the @entity34 - a group that organises aerial sportsing events - including skydiving , base jumping , and paragliding .			1
