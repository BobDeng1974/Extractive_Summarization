too often @entity4 men think female colleagues can be left to deal with ‘ women ’s issues ’ , while ‘ men get on with running the country ’			1
criticism : @entity4 mp @entity8 said every man in the party had to change their attitude towards women women have deserted the @entity28 in the last three years because they think he is out of touch and too posh , a damning survey revealed last month			1
after securing a five - point @entity4 lead among female voters at the last general election , the party has now slumped to 13 points behind @entity35			1
former @entity4 frontbencher mr @entity8 called for a ‘ zero - tolerance ’ approach from the party on sexism , warning mr @entity9 that he must ‘ be on this 24/7/365 ’ and not just at the time of reshuffles			1
the prime minister ’s shake - up of middle - ranking ministers this week saw several women promoted , including former tv presenters @entity46 and @entity48			1
mr @entity8 warned : ‘ every man in the @entity4 needs to change or be left behind			1
the leadership needs to be on this 24 - 7 - 365 , not just at re-shuffle time			0
’ writing in the @entity53 magazine he adds : ‘ many of us @entity4 men tend to feel that “ women ” can deal with “ women ’s issues ” , so men can get on with running the country			1
’ the quad of the four most senior ministers are all men – mr @entity9 , chancellor @entity64 , deputy pm @entity65 and treasury minister @entity66			2
the @entity67 is ‘ overwhelmingly men ’ and the @entity69 , including mr @entity9 , mr @entity64 and strategist @entity70 are all men			2
male - dominated : @entity9 is accused of surrounding himself with men , in government and at the top of the @entity4 party switch : @entity35 's lead over the @entity28 among women now stands at 13 points , according to a recent @entity82 / @entity81 poll mr @entity8 went on : ‘ only three out of 25 on the @entity83 are women			1
most of the advisers and policy wonks are men			0
and of course , most mps will continue to be men			0
‘ it is going to take a long time to change all this , so what else must we change ? we should look at how we all behave			0
’ mr @entity8 recalled how at a dinner to discuss prospects and tactics in the marginal seats , host lord @entity99 was asked by a woman mp about declining @entity4 support amongst women			2
the peer replied : ‘ shut up and sit down ! ’ mr @entity8 went on : ‘ he was trying to make a joke , of course , but the need to make a joke speaks volumes about the anxiety provoked by the question			0
’ @entity112 , a journalist at the @entity113 , has claimed she and a female colleague were ignored at a briefing by an advisor to the chancellor ‘ as if we were pieces of furniture rather than sentient beings ’			0
mr @entity8 wrote : ‘ and the prime minister greeted a leading high profile business women who happens to be the wife of a major donor to the party , by asking , “ and where is [ x – the husband ] ! ? ” ‘ we men are all guilty of such unconscious slights to women , but women voters see it and feel it			1
‘ a business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour			0
we have perhaps yet to understand what “ change ” in the @entity4 really means			0
‘ it is not something the leadership does , or women can do for us			0
’ the @entity4 have repeatedly launched attempts to woo the female vote , hiring advisers dedicated to developing policies which appeal to women			0
but the increase in @entity35 ’s popularity since 2010 has been fuelled by women abandoning mr @entity9 in favour of @entity155			1
three years ago 36 per cent of women backed the @entity28 , compared to 31 per cent for @entity35			2
but a new @entity81 survey for @entity82 shows only 29 per cent now support the @entity4 , with @entity35 up to 42 per cent			0
the gap is three times large than among male voters			0
@entity35 has a 25 point lead among women aged 18 - 34 and 21 points among 35 - 54 year olds			1
