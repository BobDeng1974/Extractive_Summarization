the family of a seven - year - old boy who died within a week of undergoing heart surgery have spoken of their anger after a report found that @entity7 staff shortages at an @entity9 hospital were partly to blame for the tragedy			1
@entity11 had been expected to make a full recovery from his operation but died over the @entity14 weekend after suffering a cardiac arrest at @entity16			1
a hospital investigation into his death uncovered a catalogue of avoidable errors , including the loss of vital time because junior staff did not know where to find resuscitation equipment			1
suffering : @entity11 died within a week of undergoing corrective heart surgery at @entity16 because the emergency happened on a @entity7 weekend , a surgeon had to be called in from home to treat @entity11 , the inquiry found			1
the contents of the report have shocked @entity11 's grieving parents , who believe their son would still be alive if he had received the care he needed			1
@entity36 , 30 , and @entity37 , 27 , of @entity38 , @entity39 , south @entity40 , have also raised concerns about the standard of the investigation into @entity11 's death			1
mr @entity11 said : ' @entity11 fought it ( his heart condition ) as hard as he could but in the end they let him down			2
' he wanted to grow up to be a doctor - he wanted to help children , he did n't want anyone to suffer like he had			0
anger : @entity11 's parents , @entity54 and @entity37 , hold a copy of the investigation report into their son 's death ' we 're fighting this for him			1
we want answers and we want to raise awareness			0
what about the children who are there now ? ' @entity11 was born with a congenital heart defect and had already undergone two of three corrective operations			2
he went into the hospital for the third operation and it was deemed a success			0
he was initially kept in intensive care but was transferred to another ward , @entity73 32 , after a few days			0
he suffered a cardiac arrest on @entity75			1
junior nursing staff lost vital time because they did not know where resuscitation equipment on @entity80 was kept			1
the emergency team was also unfamiliar with the equipment because cardiac arrest was rare in the ward environment			1
the fact that @entity11 suffered a cardiac arrest on @entity75 meant that the duty surgeon was at home when he collapsed and had to be urgently called in to attend hospital			1
the investigators ' report , called a ' root cause analysis ' ( @entity94 ) , does not specify when the call was made , but it states that the surgeon was at the scene within 19 minutes			0
' on the 6th april when the patient deteriorated it was a bank holiday ; although it is recognised that the resuscitation team arrived quickly , ' the document states			0
' the cardiac surgeon had responded from home and had the chest open within 19 minutes of the emergency call			2
' ' fighter ' : @entity11 , seen playing in these family photographs , had been expected to make a full recovery after undergoing corrective heart surgery what is clear is that @entity11 's heart stopped for 43 minutes before he was resuscitated , after which he underwent exploratory surgery			1
he died the following day			2
while staff numbers on the ward was set according to official guidance , low staff levels had been a problem for at least two years			0
' a risk assessment identifying low and unsafe nurse staffing and high dependency patient acuity issues was developed following a high - risk incident in october 2010 remains outstanding , ' the report states			0
there have been eight separate patient safety incidents on the ward since january , two of which prompted ' high - risk ' investigations			0
all eight were linked to problems of low staffing levels			0
@entity11 , pictured in a black and white portrait ( left ) and dressed as computer game character @entity134 ( right ) , died over the @entity14 weekend when there were hospital staff shortages other worrying factors include the resetting of potentially vital alarms on @entity11 's condition monitoring equipment after his arrival on @entity80			1
' the patient was frequently triggering the alarms on his monitoring equipment ; and the family witnessed the alarms being reset to a lower threshold by the nursing staff to stop the alarms from being activated , ' the report states			2
' triggering the alarms did not appear to trigger a medical review			0
' the 40 - page report makes eight recommendations and draws a raft of conclusions based on the experience of @entity11 's tragic death			1
but the child 's parents claim the report is less than honest and fails to give a true picture of what really happened			1
emergency : the report revealed that @entity11 's heart stopped for 43 minutes before he was resuscitated			1
he died the following day concerns : @entity11 's parents believe he would still be alive if he had received the care he needed they claim a series of factual errors appear to combine to hide the full extent of the negligence their son suffered			1
an assertion that @entity11 underwent an x-ray the day before his death is questioned in a letter sent in reply to the report			2
' if he had had an x-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and he would still be here now , ' said mr @entity11			2
' but we were with him all day and we know that it never happened			0
' he said that the family intended to fight on until the full truth was revealed			0
' if he had an x-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and he would still be here now			0
' @entity11 's father @entity36 ' there have been eight other incidents since january 2012			2
they can not tell us who the people were but that should be made public , ' mr @entity11 said			0
' we have written saying that we are not happy with the report			0
' he said one major problem was that nursing staff failed to listen to them when they were anxiously calling for help for @entity11			2
that view is supported by the report itself , which states : ' failure to listen to the ' voice of the patient ' is recognised to be a major contributory factor in patient safety investigations			0
' however , it concluded : ' the @entity94 team were unable to comment on whether listening to the family on this occasion would have changed the patient outcome			0
' inquiry : the report stated that a catalogue of avoidable human errors at @entity16 ( pictured ) had fatal consequences for @entity11			1

@entity11 was expected to make full recovery after undergoing corrective surgery at @entity16
but he suffered a cardiac arrest within a week and died the following day
hospital investigation into his death finds human errors during his care
vital time lost because junior staff could n't find resuscitation equipment
@entity243 had to be called in from home because emergency happened on @entity75
@entity11 's parents say their son would still be alive if he had received the care he needed
