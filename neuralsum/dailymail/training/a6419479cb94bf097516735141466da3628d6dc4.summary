@entity0 , deputy head of the @entity1 , has been jailed for six years for being the ringleader in running a tax - free tobacconist by abusing his diplomatic privileges a gang of @entity7 diplomats who turned their @entity9 embassy into a tax - free tobacconist and avoided paying almost £ 5million in tax have been jailed for a total of 33 years			1
@entity0 , 54 , the deputy head of the @entity1 in @entity14 in @entity9 , and his colleagues ordered 29 tonnes of rolling tobacco over three years - amounting to more than half a million pouches			1
at one point their racket became so large that people were queuing outside the embassy to buy the tobacco			1
@entity0 and six other members of staff ' systematically abused ' diplomatic tax exemptions and were caught after the @entity27 was alerted to the system being misused			1
they decided the vast amounts could not possibly be for personal use and launched a criminal investigation which led the @entity7 government to waive the diplomatic immunity of the seven			1
a judge branded the tobacco racket a ' substantial fraud ' and said the diplomats had made ' every citizen in this country ' losers by committing the deception so they could make large profits			1
the gang denied conspiracy to cheat the public revenue but were found guilty after a trial at @entity49 lasting more than a month			0
the court previously heard that the 50g pouches were imported at tax - free rates which were only permissible for goods for personal use or that of the @entity56			1
but the diplomats did not smoke and sold the tobacco from the @entity1 , a £ 6million redbrick town house in west @entity9 , while failing to pay £ 4.8m in vat and excise duty			1
as it became more successful the tobacco racket became even bigger			1
later it became so ' bold ' long queues of customers were seen queuing outside the embassy to buy the tobacco			1
during the trial it emerged that demand became so high that members of the gang were ordering tobacco worth more than their annual salary , and so much of it that firm which supplied them could n't keep up with demand			1
@entity0 , who was a senior staff member and considered a ' father figure ' , was the ringleader , but all the diplomats profited from the scam			1
he was jailed for seven years			2
first secretary @entity81 , 48 and finance attache @entity82 , 38 , were jailed for six years			2
welfare officer @entity83 , 29 , who sobbed throughout the hearing , was sentenced to five years			0
first secretary @entity81 ( left ) was part of the group which abused their diplomatic privileges to buy and sell dozens of tonnes of rolling tobacco which was found in crates ( right ) and seized by police all four diplomats had earlier been found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue			1
they all had diplomatic privileges , but these were waived by the @entity96 , and they now face deportation after their spells in prison			2
fellow workers @entity101 , 54 , @entity102 , 49 , and @entity103 , 60 , were also convicted of aiding the tax fraud and jailed , but none had diplomatic privileges			1
the racket became so successful queues were seen for the tobacco outside the @entity110 ( left with @entity7 flag ) which is in one of @entity9 's most expensive streets in @entity14 , in south west @entity9 judge @entity114 said the four diplomats ' breached the trust ' of the @entity117 and @entity7 people			1
he said : ' in any view this was a substantial fraud on the public purse and the losers are every citizen of this country			1
' each of you say you were trying simply to help you fellow @entity127			0
in my judgement that is not just nonsense , it is a downright lie			0
' each of you made a substantial profit - this was your business			2
dozens of boxes of tobacco were found in the @entity7 embassy which at times resembled a ' warehouse ' ' as you felt increasingly confident the orders placed by you in your own names and others connected to the @entity1 increased dramatically			1
' judge @entity143 said they ordered so much tobacco in such an obvious way that the only conclusion was that they believed they would never be caught			0
' the quantities of tobacco ordered meant that at times the @entity1 must have looked like a wholesale warehouse , added the judge			2
the tobacco racket became so successful and in such demand that suppliers could not keep up with orders the government of @entity7 waived the diplomatic privileges of the four so they could be investigated and scores of crates of tobacco , which had been ordered using tax exemption privileges , were found ' there is no doubt in my mind that this was a dishonest business operated on an increasingly large scale			1
' he said the four diplomats had committed ' significant breaches of trust ' given to them by the @entity117 and @entity7 governments			1
' first , you have breached the trust of the president and people of @entity7 , ' added judge @entity143			2
' you were each sent to @entity9 to represent your country and you were certainly expected , as diplomats , to maintain the highest possible standards of integrity and honesty			2
diplomatic immunity has existed for more than 50 years and is agreed on by almost every country in the world , even those with frosty international relations such as @entity188			2
it was signed into law under the @entity191 to ensure diplomats can represent their nation without being harassed by their hosts			0
this is particularly essential in countries which criminalise behaviour which would be perfectly acceptable at home , and those which prosecute people for political reasons			0
but there have been abuses of the system - including the fact that diplomats do not have to pay parking fines			2
more than £ 60million of @entity9 's congestion charge fines have been avoided by embassies , foreign secretary @entity208 revealed last year , including £ 7million by @entity212 diplomats alone			1
it is extremely rare for immunity to be waived , and it can only happen with the agreement of the diplomat 's home country			0
some nations refuse on principle , while most reserve the measure only for serious crimes			0
in 2002 @entity223 waived diplomatic immunity on a @entity9 - based official who was accused of killing a mugger			1
he was later found not guilty of manslaughter and murder			0
' second , the @entity117 was entitled to expect that you would respect and comply with the laws of this country			2
you have breached that trust as well			0
' fellow embassy workers @entity101 , 54 , @entity102 , 49 , and @entity103 , 60 , were convicted of the same offence as the four diplomats			0
@entity101 was also convicted of dealing , harbouring , concealing or carrying dutiable goods			0
they were all jailed for three years each			0
the court heard the convictions are a ' tremendous fall from grace ' for the diplomats			0
@entity0 's family is in thousands of pounds of debt and face eviction , while his wife works on the checkout at @entity249 , the court was told			0
defence lawyers said the diplomats face severe ' consequences ' if they were deported back to @entity7 after their prison sentences			2
@entity254 , representing @entity0 , said : ' there is a likelihood that an ability to return to @entity7 will be fraught with very serious consequences			1
' there is at least a regime which gives tough penalties to those who transgress			0
' eighth defendant @entity263 , who worked in the same building for the @entity265 , was found not guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue			0
the @entity110 is now officially known as the @entity268 after the @entity270 nation left the @entity271 last year			0
@entity272 , solictor advocate at @entity274 , represented the four diplomats			0
following the sentencing he said : ' my clients have accepted what they see as a harsh sentence for the crime that was committed under @entity117 laws			0
' however this case raises important wider international law issues , specifically in relation to diplomatic immunity and when it can and ca n’t be waived			0
