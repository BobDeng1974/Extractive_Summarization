nobody gets out the bunting for sixth place , but there is more to @entity5 ’s inch - by - inch pro-gress up the table than first sight suggests			1
this win edged them past @entity10 on sunday , but the gap now separating @entity5 from clubs with loftier ambitions is increasingly small			1
they are a point behind @entity16 , whose bubble may be about to pop , two points off @entity20 in fourth , three points away from @entity22 in third			1
inferior goal difference means @entity5 will need to go that extra yard but , on this form , it is well within their power			1
they scored with their first two shots on target in this game , the second in the 73rd minute , but that should not detract from the display			0
@entity16 had three first - half penalty appeals — one of which was particularly convincing — but this was a gutsy , impressive win on a day that made it impossible to play the brand of football that is the trademark of manager @entity45			1

click here for more from @entity109 's excellent @entity108 @entity5 had to tough it out instead , and did			1
in a spoiling swirl of wind and driving rain , not to mention strength - sapping bitter cold , they dug in against the formidable aerial power of @entity77 , and the midfield worked hard			2
they have now kept five consecutive clean sheets away from home in the league — a record unmatched since 1985 , the days of @entity121 and @entity122			0
no , it was n’t the prettiest , but it was never going to be , and @entity106 ’s first goal at least was a thing of beauty			1
it was fitting that it should take place in front of local hero @entity131 , too			0
it will not have greatly pleased him — he is too much of a @entity16 loyalist for that — but he would surely have admired the artistry and the technique			2
@entity90 slipped a simple pass inside to @entity46 and he turned it into something truly magnificent with a curling shot from 30 yards			2
@entity131 scored a few like that and it may have jogged his memory as @entity46 ’s effort bent perfectly beyond the reach of @entity64 , struck the underside of the bar and bounced down over the line , as if the ball itself knew a degree of aesthetic flamboyance was required for such a finish			0
that was after just three minutes , and 70 had passed by the time @entity5 struck their next shot on target , again with success			1
the fact that @entity16 ’s usually pin - sharp defence made not one , but two mistakes , on the way to goal illustrates the job that @entity5 had done by then			1
soaking up the pressure and leaving them exhausted			0
@entity46 struck a superb effort from 25 yards which left @entity16 goalkeeper @entity64 helpless @entity16 goalkeeper @entity64 could do nothing as he was beaten by the @entity173 's excellent finish @entity46 ( right ) celebrates with team - mates @entity90 ( left ) , @entity61 ( second left ) and @entity89 former @entity16 midfielder @entity92 ( left ) is tackled by @entity72 of @entity16 at @entity60 's what did @entity175 make of the declined penalty appeals ? find out here			1
one would never have guessed it was @entity5 that had played a @entity182 game as recently as thursday			2
@entity16 substitute @entity73 played a careless square ball directly to @entity91 , whose forward run ended with a cross which should have been cleared by @entity68			2
instead , off - balance , he tapped it helplessly to @entity61 , who drove the ball through a crowd of players , goalkeeper @entity64 unsighted until it was too late			1
so nothing to celebrate yet , but suddenly @entity5 have options			2
when @entity45 left out @entity93 many felt it was a sign he was prioritising the @entity196 as the best entry route to next season ’s @entity198			2
if it was even half in @entity45 ’s mind that the small number of set - pieces required to secure cup qualification might prove less of an obstacle than an assault on a top four , he can now afford to play both ends			1
squeezed by @entity22 and @entity16 , and now @entity5 , the league is their only route back			1
@entity5 manager @entity45 directs his players in the rain on the touchline in front of @entity16 boss @entity217 ( right ) @entity5 's teenage winger @entity86 attempts to take the ball past @entity16 youngster @entity68 @entity75 of @entity16 is caught in a sandwich between @entity85 ( top ) and @entity89 @entity5 goalkeeper @entity83 rushes out to the edge of his area to block a shot from @entity16 's @entity74 and what of @entity16 , pace - setters , fairy - tale , the @entity198 choice of all football romantics ? it is going to be hard going from here			1
@entity16 have won one game in the last five in all competitions and sunday ’s display fizzled out into a standard hard - luck story of penalty appeals denied			1
they did n’t play poorly , but they did n’t convince , either , and the feeling of injustice that permeated @entity60 ’s obscures a dip in form			2
@entity16 look leggy and their threat reduced as the game wore on			2
the filthy weather that plagued the south coast made flowing football a forlorn hope , so no wonder much of @entity16 ’s threat came from balls in the air , won by @entity77 , who was a handful without being a threat			2
@entity5 do not care for that option , as @entity45 made plain on the day he told @entity258 he had no future at the club			1
even so , the real enemy , according to the locals , was not the rain or the wind but referee @entity101 , who rejected four penalty appeals			0
that the first came after just 25 seconds created a feeling of injustice to rival that felt by @entity271 manager @entity270			0
friend , who is having a weekend of it , was the fourth official at @entity274 on saturday , too			0
new signing @entity75 , on his debut , was the first to fail to convince friend , putting @entity281 under pressure from the opening attack of the game			0
can certainly seemed to place a hand on his shoulder , and not in a fatherly way , but not with the force needed to make @entity75 collapse as he did			0
the ease with which he went down probably got can off the hook			0
maybe @entity75 , on loan from @entity291 , would have swayed official judgment in @entity294 ’s league , but not here			0
the second was more convincing , @entity89 bringing down @entity75 only to find friend curiously unmoved			0
the ball ran free to @entity74 , who forced @entity83 to make a fine save , overlooked in the furore			0
@entity5 forward @entity61 is tackled by @entity16 defender @entity66 at @entity60 's while goalkeeper @entity64 watches on @entity85 ( left ) appears to handle the ball in an incident which saw @entity16 unsuccessfully appeal for a penalty @entity16 forward @entity74 charges forward with the ball as he battles with @entity5 defender @entity84 ( right ) only @entity64 ( 12 ) and @entity306 ( @entity307 , 10 ) have kept more @entity309 clean sheets this season than @entity83 ( nine )			1
a final penalty appeal was made against can , for handball , just before half - time but there was a growing feeling of resignation about @entity16 ’s desperate pleas			1
seconds earlier , they were making a strong case for a free - kick just outside the box			0
a long pass sent @entity74 through and @entity83 came charging from his line , intercepting with inches to spare on the edge of the area			0
it hit his body inside , but perhaps a hand outside , although it is hard to see how @entity101 could have made a handball call with any certainty			0
tv replays were not totally clear initially , suggesting his reluctance was justified			0
even if video technology is allowed it is unlikely to clear up incidents such as this in the time allotted			0
@entity61 had one rejected at the other end , too , but it appeared @entity66 got the ball			2
even if he had n’t , it is hard to imagine friend pointing to the spot			0
maybe he ’s just the sceptical type			0
a view of the action during the clash between @entity16 and @entity5 at a rainy @entity60 's on sunday afternoon @entity5 forward @entity61 struck from inside the penalty area to make it 2 - 0 as @entity73 ( left ) tried to prevent him			1

@entity106 strikes a superb 30 - yard effort inside three minutes in @entity5 *victory*
@entity61 adds a second as @entity59 defeat @entity16 at @entity60 's on sunday
@entity45 ' side up to sixth in the @entity309 as they close in on top four
