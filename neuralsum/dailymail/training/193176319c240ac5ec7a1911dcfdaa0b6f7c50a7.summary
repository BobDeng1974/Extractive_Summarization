now he has revealed he stepped down because his role as lead presenter was given to fellow gardener and @entity13 columnist @entity12			1
mr @entity1 said he was ‘ hurt ’ by the @entity15 ’s decision to do so and when asked to play second - fiddle to mr @entity12 , he said he was made ‘ an offer i had to refuse ’			1

was i dumped for @entity12 ? you might say that			1
i could n’t possibly comment			2
i do n’t feel dumped			2
they made me an offer i had to refuse			2
it ’s up to them			2
‘ i was disappointed but i ’m not a grudge - bearer			2
you have to move on			2
nobody owes you a living			0
i ’m still gainfully employed			0
my days are n’t empty			0
’ mr @entity1 was the unofficial face of @entity4 for 30 years gaining as much attraction from television viewers as the prize - winning gardens			1
the chat show host denied that his replacement ’s lack of horticultural training - @entity12 is a self - professed ‘ amateur gardener ’ - bothered him			1
‘ presenting is a skill in itself			0
i ’ve presented programmes on classical music , nature and the royal family , all lifelong interests			0
i do n’t hold @entity12 ’s lack of training against him , ’ he said			1
@entity1 , who was succeeded by @entity12 on @entity20 ’ world when he left in 2002 , added : ‘ he ’s passionate and he gets through to a lot of people			1

the people who have life sussed are outward - looking , doing stuff for other folk			0
‘ there ’s so much self - analysis now			0
i realise it seems rich coming from someone whose work is in the media , the cult of personality if you like , but fame is a by - product , not a goal			0
what drives me is contentment , satisfaction and stimulation , and the avoidance of jealousy and bitterness			0
those things do n’t achieve anything			0
’ despite this , mr @entity1 claims never to have watched @entity20 ’ world – which he fronted for six years – since mr @entity12 took over			1
interview : @entity1 opens up in the latest issue of the @entity26 he said : ‘ i ’d either be grumpy because i did n’t like what they were doing , or uppity because they were doing it too well			1
