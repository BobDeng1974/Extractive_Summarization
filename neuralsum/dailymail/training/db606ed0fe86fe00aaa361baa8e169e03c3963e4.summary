but that 's exactly where many of the @entity14 writer 's best - known tales , including ' @entity15 , ' took shape			2
in honor of his connections to @entity9 , a group of scholars known as the @entity2 is holding its symposium outside the @entity14 for the first time — and touring a home the author built in the shape of a ship , high on a hill overlooking the @entity28			1
during the four years he lived there , one of the greatest chroniclers of 19th - century @entity14 imperialism snowshoed in winter , went to barn dances and made friends with his neighbors			0
famous writer : this late 1800 's photo from a collection in the @entity40 shows author @entity2 in the library of the home he named @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity9 home : author @entity2 's @entity9 home , pictured , which he named @entity43 , is framed by foliage in @entity44			1
kipling scholars from the @entity14 and the @entity49 will be at @entity9 's @entity50 monday and tuesday , october 7 and 8 , 2013 , for the first - ever meeting of the @entity2 outside the @entity14 ' i found the neighbors were flattered to have @entity2 among them			1
they were keenly interested in his work , that they respected rather than resented his apparent , and only apparent , wish to keep to himself , ' said @entity58 , a retired professor from @entity60 's @entity59 who gave the keynote address monday at the two - day symposium , ' @entity2 in @entity49 , ' at @entity9 's @entity50 in @entity63 , not far from @entity2 's home in @entity44			1
@entity2 lived in @entity44 from 1892 to 1896 when he wrote ' @entity65 , ' the story of a mongoose that battled two vicious cobras in @entity69 while protecting his human family from harm			1
while in @entity9 , he also wrote the other stories in his collection ' @entity15 ' ; ' captains courageous ' ; the poems of ' the @entity80 ' ; and many of the stories in ' @entity77 ' and ' @entity78			1
' artifacts : @entity50 librarian @entity82 holds @entity2 and @entity84 's marriage license books : some of @entity86 , works by author @entity2 , are shown at @entity87 in @entity63 , @entity9 he was drawn to @entity9 because of his wife , who was from @entity89			2
part of the draw for the 60 scholars visiting this week from the @entity14 and the @entity49 will be a tour on tuesday of @entity43 , the home he built in the shape of a ship			1
they are also viewing some of the college 's @entity2 holdings , such as the contents of a safe deposit box that was discovered untouched in the early 1990s after almost a century in a bank in @entity89			0
among the items in it were a copy of his marriage license			0
organizers hope the meeting will serve to revive @entity2 's reputation , which among scholars declined through the middle years of the 20th century as the @entity14 imperial era declined in esteem			0
belongings : a box belonging to author @entity2 , which was discovered in a @entity9 bank vault and is now part of @entity50 's @entity119 in @entity63			2
the box contained an unpublished poem among other documents poem : an unpublished poem titled ' in the @entity124 , ' by the author @entity2 is at @entity50 's library ' we will hear something about @entity2 the ideologist of imperialism , because he was that , as a spokesman ; he saw the @entity14 empire as the great force for spreading law and progression , ' said professor @entity136 , the editor of the @entity137 and director of the symposium			2
' but also he was this wonderful tale teller and also , the thing that is so nice about @entity2 , he is so interested in people			0
' @entity143 , a @entity144 scholar who has studied @entity2 while earning her doctorate at the @entity146 , said many of the topics @entity2 wrote about a century ago remain relevant today , in the age of globalization			0
' he talked about empire , how different people from different continents and different races have to live together			0
i think he will become even more relevant now , ' @entity143 said			0
' it 's not just that he 's a brilliant writer ; he has a vision for the future			0
