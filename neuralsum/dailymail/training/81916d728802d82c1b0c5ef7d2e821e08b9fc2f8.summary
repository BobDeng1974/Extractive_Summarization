while some physicists may be working on string theory or quantum mechanics , @entity0 has decided to turn his attention to something else entirely – ice cream			1
the @entity8 physicist and now professional cook has announced that he has invented a ‘ magical ’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it			1
dubbed ‘ @entity14 ’ , the ice creams tastes like a mix of fruits and was created during a cooking course attended by mr @entity0 in @entity18			1
the @entity8 physicist and now professional cook has just announced that he has been able to invent a ‘ magical ’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it everyone laughed at his idea , but as a physicist he knew that there are various possibilities that might work , the 37 - year - old told @entity33			1
before it ’s served , the treat is a light blue colour , but this quickly changes when the server adds a spray of ‘ love elixir , as mr @entity0 calls it			1
the spray transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in around 10 to 15 seconds			1
before it ’s served , the treat is a light blue colour ( pictured ) , but this quickly changes when the server adds a spray of ‘ love elixir , as mr @entity0 calls it			1
the spray transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in around 10 to 15 seconds when the customer licks the ice cream , it again changes into other pink shades as it melts the formula , which remains a secret , is made entirely from natural ingredients , according to mr @entity0			1
the @entity57 said he gained his inspiration from the @entity60 ice cream genius @entity61 , the creator of a fluorescent ice			2
the chef is currently offering his ice cream at his shop in in the town of @entity67 , in the east @entity8 province of @entity18			2
he is also working on another two ice creams			0
one will react to ultraviolet lights in clubs , while another will turn from white to pink as it ’s eaten			0
mr @entity0 is now hoping to find buyers to sell the ice cream abroad			2
the science of ice cream just got serious			2
no longer content with simple taste tests , scientists now want to visualise exactly how the treat melts in the mouth			0
and one group of researchers in @entity8 has been able to do just that using software that reveals what makes the summer treat so addictive			0
using a technique known as @entity91 ( @entity91 ) , researchers have analysed how much ' coldness ' , ' creaminess ' and ' roughness ' is need to make the perfect frozen dessert			0
the software is able to generate coloured curves that follow changes in a variety of attributes , which also include ' gumminess ' and how much the ice cream coats the taster 's mouth			0
‘ as well as how it looks before being served , the texture on our tongue and palate is key to it being accepted and considered as a quality product , ’ said researcher @entity103			0
using a technique known as @entity91 , researchers have been able to analyse the fleeting experience of eating			0
these graphs shows taste curves for two types of ice cream , the left containing only sweetened milk ( m ) and the right containing milk , cream , egg and the chemical hydrocolloids ( @entity127 )			0

37 - year - old @entity0 from @entity18 created ‘ @entity14 ’ ice cream
the treat , made from natural ingredients , *initially* comes in a blue shade
server adds a spray of ‘ love elixir ' , as mr @entity0 calls it , to change colour
this transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in 10 to 15 seconds
when the customer licks the ice cream , it again changes shade as it melts
