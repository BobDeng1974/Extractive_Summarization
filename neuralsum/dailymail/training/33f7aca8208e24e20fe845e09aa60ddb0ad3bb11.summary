@entity1 ’s final game of the season			1
it ’s often an irrelevance			0
it ’s usually because the title is sewn up , with the fans anticipating one final bow , trophy in tow			0
this year , obviously , things are a little different			0
it is an irrelevance in terms of results – a probably unwanted @entity15 campaign aside – but for vastly different reasons			0
@entity17 will be working from a clean slate as @entity1 slipped to an unprecedented seventh in the league , lurching from disaster to disaster under @entity23			2
almost as hotly - anticipated as the new manager is the thought of a squad revamp , with a huge amount of deadwood being whittled down			0
with the departure of @entity49 already confirmed , a few more @entity1 stalwarts could follow the big @entity50 out of the exit door			1
@entity53 ’s future is one of the most up in the air			0
looking a dead certainty to move when @entity23 was in charge , it seems he could possibly now stay at @entity38			0
however , the former @entity60 defender – and not many have been crying out for his return to the squad for next month ’s @entity63 – does n’t stack up compared to others in his position			0
left trailing : this graphic shows that @entity53 does not stack up compared to his fellow defenders out of statistics including tackles , blocks , interceptions and duels won in the air and overall , @entity53 is n’t anywhere near the top of the pile at @entity1 on any count – even taking into account his relative lack of game - time			1
on two crucial counts – aerial battles and tackles – he ’s the weakest by a distance			0
@entity53 has never been a @entity85 ( or , indeed , @entity49 ) style rough and ready defender , but a player of his experience and stature should not be lagging behind arguably similar style players like @entity91			1
should he stay or should he go ? @entity53 's ( right ) future at @entity38 is uncertain it seems every player linked with a summer move to @entity38 is a central midfielder			1
it does n’t say a lot for @entity1 ’s only signing of the summer , @entity99			1
becoming synonymous with the reign of @entity23 is not something that ’s going to stand anyone in good stead for a successful career at @entity1			0
bought to be the all - encompassing midfielder @entity1 have so desperately needed – many would say the gaping chasm in the side even sir @entity110 failed to remedy – the @entity105 has come up short on every count			2
little impact : this pitch map shows where @entity99 has created five chances from this season he ’s created just five chances for his team - mates this season , making just four other key passes			1
for a player meant to be the driving force in @entity1 ’s midfield , this is ludicrously poor			2
one of these came post-moyes against @entity126 on tuesday – for @entity128 ’s first goal – and just one all season came from that crucial area just inside the opposition half , the area he was bought to dominate			0
his current manager , @entity133 – at 40 years old – creates more than @entity99			2
flop : @entity99 was @entity1 's only signing last summer and has come up short at @entity38 it may finally be time for the sun to set on @entity133 ’ glorious career , winning just over 29 per cent of his duels against opposition players in his 505 minutes of @entity141 football this season , but he ’s still managed to make more incisive passes than @entity99			1
@entity133 ’ former role , that of the physics - defying flying winger , has been yet another problem for @entity1 this season			1
@entity150 is surely entering his final weeks as a @entity1 player			2
comparing him with out - and - out wingers at other top clubs shows him in a very poor light			1
on the wing : this graphic compares @entity150 with out - and - out wingers at other top clubs @entity160 ’s @entity159 , @entity162 ’s @entity161 and @entity164 ’s @entity163 all beat him on almost every count			1
@entity166 does n’t create enough chances , provide enough threat on goal , or win enough one - on - one battles with his opposite man			0
the only counterpart he beats on any statistic is @entity161 on going past players			0
@entity162 ’s @entity177 winger makes up for that by providing the most attacking threat of his own accord			0
poor show : @entity150 ( left ) is lacking on almost every count when compared to other top wingers players who pass to @entity185 more than anyone in bold @entity187 188 @entity188 103 @entity189 100 @entity166 94 @entity99 84 one of the few players to emerge with credit this season has been @entity185			1
the @entity60 striker never seemed to give up when the chips were seriously down under @entity195			0
however , @entity1 have built their game around him too heavily			1
a whole host of players have played more passes to @entity185 than anyone else in the side			2
while @entity185 has created an impressive 56 chances – by far @entity1 ’s most – he has n’t always been able to carve out the required ball			1
his go - to pass , for example , is back to @entity187 – who he has passed to more than double the amount of times he ’s passed to @entity211 – 135 to 50			0
up for the fight : @entity185 is one of the few @entity1 players to emerge with credit this season it ’s true , that figure is dampened by @entity218 ’s availability , but surely @entity219 will keep faith with his compatriot			1
if @entity185 ’s face is going to fit at the new @entity1 , he may have to learn to play second fiddle to his supposed strike partner			2
the @entity60 star excels at dropping deep and feeding off another striker , yet with signings surely on the way – not to mention @entity188 ’s designs on the playmaker role – @entity185 could find this season ’s efforts in vain .			2

more @entity1 players could follow @entity49 out of the exit door when the new manager arrives at @entity38
@entity53 's statistics do not stack up compared to his fellow @entity1 defenders
@entity99 has created just five chances for his team - mates this season
comparing @entity150 with wingers at other top clubs shows the @entity247 in a very poor light
@entity1 have built their game around @entity185 too heavily
