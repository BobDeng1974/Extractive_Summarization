babies with ‘ three parents ’ could be created in @entity4 laboratories within two years , it emerged yesterday			1
the @entity4 fertility regulator said there was no evidence that the controversial technique would be unsafe , but called for extra checks before approving it for use			1
these could take up to two years			2
however , some leading scientists said that no time is to be lost in changing the law to allow women to be treated			2
hope : babies with ' three parents ' could be created in @entity4 laboratories within two years , it has emerged			1
the @entity4 fertility regulator said there was no evidence the @entity22 controversial technique would be unsafe ( file picture ) this would make @entity4 the first country in the world to sanction the creation of babies that effectively have three parents – two mothers and a father			1
supporters say it will give couples who have endured the heartache of repeatedly miscarrying or burying much longed - for children the option of having a healthy family			1
but critics argue that genetically engineering eggs and embryos crosses a crucial ethical line			1
done differently , it could lead to the creation of ‘ perfect ’ babies , made to order by hair or eye colour			2
mitochondria are tiny powerhouses in cells that generate energy and have a small amount of their own dna , separate from the bulk of the human genetic code			2
defects in mitochondrial dna ( @entity59 ) are responsible for a host of inherited diseases , including conditions leading to muscle wasting , heart problems , loss of vision , organ failure and epilepsy			0
@entity70 treatment , which employs two different ivf techniques , aims to prevent these diseases by giving babies healthy @entity59 from donor eggs			1
the baby is born with normal ' nuclear ' @entity53 passed down by its parents - containing most inherited traits such as eye and hair colour and height - plus a tiny amount of @entity59 donated by a second donor ' mother '			0
in effect the baby has three genetic parents , though the donated @entity59 contains less than 1 per cent of its genes			2
since the healthy @entity59 would be inherited by future generations , the treatment has the potential to eradicate mitochondrial diseases from affected families			1
critics argue that allowing the treatments could be the first step down a slippery slope towards ' designer babies '			1
the controversy surrounds work being carried out at @entity101 into incurable diseases caused by mitochondria – the tiny sausage - shaped powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy			1
these defects cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and are responsible for 50 genetic diseases , many of which kill in infancy			1
women carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be best to remain childless			1
to help them , scientists have developed techniques in which the mother - to - be ’s diseased mitochondria are swapped with healthy ones from an egg donated by another woman			0
successful ‘ mitochondrial replacement ’ would allow the couple a healthy child that is genetically their own			2
as the changes would be passed down the generations , it would also eliminate the disease from future generations of the family			0
any child would have dna from two eggs and one sperm – and so effectively have two mothers and one father - although the genetic contribution from the donated egg would be very small			0
the government has already given the treatment its backing and published draft rules that will allow it – if @entity148 agrees			0
and it had been predicted that the law could be changed by the end of this year			0
but yesterday , a study by the fertility watchdog , the @entity153 , urged caution			0
the authors said that while they have not seen any evidence that the techniques are unsafe , crucial research needed to be done , before the first women are treated			1
panel chairman dr @entity160 said : ‘ the scientific questions that we examined and the research that we examined – and it was voluminous – will never answer all of the critical questions			0
and , of course it wo n’t answer the fundamental question , which is are these techniques safe and efficacious in humans			0
’ three parents : the techniques involve replacing defective @entity53 in the mother 's egg with material from a donor egg			0
this means the resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father however , he added that the same sort of safety questions existed before the birth of @entity182 , the world ’s first test - tube baby			0
dr @entity185 , of campaign group @entity186 , said the techniques ‘ open the door to a designer baby future ’			0
@entity101 described the report as ‘ very encouraging ’ but could n’t say when it would be ready to treat the first woman .			0

babies with ' three parents ' could be created in @entity4 within two years
@entity4 fertility regulator said there was no evidence technique was unsafe
however , it has called for additional checks before approving it for use
approach is designed to help families with particular genetic faults who want to avoid passing on *devastating* incurable diseases to their children
gives women who repeatedly miscarry ' option of having healthy family '
but critics argue genetically engineering embryos crosses ethical line
