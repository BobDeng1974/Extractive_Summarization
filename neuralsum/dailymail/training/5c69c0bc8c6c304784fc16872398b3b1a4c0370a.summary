gardening , golf and package holidays are behind soaring hospital admissions for skin cancer , researchers warn			1
rates have risen by around 40 per cent in just four years and almost 124,000 now need hospital treatment annually			1
experts are particularly concerned about the high number of older men diagnosed too late with malignant melanoma , the deadliest form of the disease			1
these tumours commonly develop on their backs , appearing as moles , but many men may not notice until too late			0
a @entity33 study shows hospital admissions for malignant melanoma increased from 11,157 to 14,475 between 2007 and 2011			1
over the same period , admissions for non-malignant melanoma , which is far more common but rarely fatal , soared from 76,528 to 109,333			1
this is an overall rise in admissions of 41 per cent in four years			2
lead researcher professor @entity40 said the rise was partly due to people not covering themselves up or using sun cream on package holidays , while playing golf or during time in the garden here			0
‘ men are particularly vulnerable as they tend to take off their shirts and wo n’t bother putting on sun cream , ’ she added			0
‘ we wonder whether the increase in older men [ being admitted for melanoma ] is a legacy of home exposure as well as the increase of overseas holidays … we also wonder whether they are less likely to wear sun cream … we are concerned about how quickly the rates are increasing in old men			2
‘ males are more likely to get melanomas on their back and they are presenting very late			0
we need men to be examining their backs more			0
‘ we do n’t know if it is because they are more vain or more stoical			0
we do n’t want melanomas to be missed particularly if they can be treated			0
’ professor @entity65 said non-malignant melanoma are not seen as important ‘ as they do n’t kill people but they do result in an enormous number of procedures for the @entity71 ’			1
men are particularly vulnerable as they tend to take off their shirts and wo n’t bother putting on sun cream ( file photos ) the study also found the @entity71 is spending £ 95.5million treating skin cancer			1
@entity77 , of @entity78 , said : ‘ changes to where patients are treated may have added to the size of this increase in hospital treatment … but it ’s worrying to see rising rates of a disease that could largely be prevented			2
’ she added that september sun in the @entity89 can still be strong enough to burn , especially for sensitive skin			2
’ separate figures from @entity33 show the highest number of malignant melanoma cases occur in men aged 65 to 69 – 778 in 2012			1
professor @entity95 , of the @entity96 on @entity97 of the skin , said : ‘ older men were brought up in an era where [ people ] had n’t been indoctrinated with the knowledge that sun is bad for you			2
‘ but older men … spend a lot of time outdoors … most do n’t like putting sunscreen on			0
they ca n’t be bothered			0
