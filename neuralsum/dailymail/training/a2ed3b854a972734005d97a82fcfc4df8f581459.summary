by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:03 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 17 september 2013 senior @entity3 dems today slapped down @entity4 for claiming the coalition could break up before the 2015 election			0
treasury minister @entity7 dismissed his @entity10 colleague 's suggestion that it is ‘ a possibility ’ that the power sharing deal with the @entity12 will collapse before 2015			1
business secretary mr @entity4 stunned colleagues by also indicating that he has private ‘ red lines ’ that would prompt him to walk out of the @entity10			1
row : relations have soured between chief secretary to the treasury @entity7 and @entity4 in recent weeks as divisions emerged over the economy the @entity20 conference in @entity21 has been dominated by the increasingly erratic behaviour of mr @entity4 , attacking @entity24 coalition partners and distancing himself from the government 's economic recovery			1
senior allies of @entity28 have grown irritated by what they see as disloyalty which risks undermining the key messages the party has on fairness and economic competence			0
the veteran minister also faced @entity24 anger last night after dismissing his conservative colleagues as ‘ nasty ’ , ‘ callous ’ and ‘ ugly ’ opportunists			1
asked at a fringe meeting at the @entity20 conference whether anything would ever compel him to quit the @entity42 , mr @entity4 made clear he has privately considered quitting the government			1
‘ i think president @entity44 has just proven very eloquently in recent weeks the dangers of parading your red lines in public , ’ he said			2
‘ i am not going to do an @entity44			0
’ asked whether the government might collapse , mr @entity4 said : ‘ it ’s certainly possible			1
we are not at the stage of talking about that process			0
it is obviously a highly sensitive one			0
’ but mr @entity7 , the chief secretary to the treasury and a key ally to mr @entity28 , rubbished the idea the coalition would break - up			1
he told @entity59 : ' this coalition will continue until the end of this @entity62 , as we promised			2
' we have a very big job to do to clean up the economic mess that @entity65 left behind and to entrench the recovery that we are starting to see			2
' to make sure that we create the jobs in this country that need to be created , that we deliver the big tax cuts for millions of working people that we promised , that we continue the process of sorting out the financial system			0
' mr @entity7 added : ' we are not going to walk away from that job months or years before the end of the coalition government			1
' @entity77 , former head of communications for the @entity20 , said she also believes the coalition will last until the next general election			1
asked whether the government might collapse , mr @entity4 said : ¿ it ¿ s certainly possible ' allies of mr @entity4 have privately suggested that if there is a hung @entity62 , he could become chancellor in a coalition with @entity65 and oust mr @entity28 as @entity20 leader – a move they call ‘ @entity89 ’			1
in an overture to @entity65 , mr @entity4 said it was his ‘ working assumption ’ that the @entity20 should pick a future coalition partner based on the number of seats , rather than votes , that they win – a formula that favours @entity65 since the electoral system gives it an advantage			1
in his main speech to the conference in @entity21 , mr cable , a former member of the @entity65 , said @entity65 had ‘ fallen asleep at the wheel ’ in the run up to the financial crash			1
but he then launched an intemperate attack on the @entity24 , making clear that he holds them in contempt			2
mr @entity4 said : ‘ the @entity12 ’ friends and donors were at the heart of the greed and recklessness which lay behind that disaster			2
’ mr @entity4 directly contradicted @entity28 who has said the @entity42 will survive until polling day he accused the conservatives of ‘ callous ’ behaviour towards immigrants , unions and benefit claimants and attacked the @entity12 ’ election strategist @entity121 , whom he labelled ‘ an @entity122 ’			2
branding the @entity24 the ‘ @entity12 ’ , mr @entity4 criticised what he called their ‘ blinkered , small - state ideology ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity125 may once characterised the @entity12 as the nasty party			0
after a few years of trying to be nice and inclusive it has reverted to type			0
‘ the list of people the @entity12 disapprove of is even longer than that			0
public sector workers , the unmarried , people who do n’t own property			0
we must not allow them to turn the clock back			0
’ he added : ‘ that is not our kind of politics			0
’ mr @entity4 even warned that @entity24 allies could spark a new financial collapse			2
he dismissed @entity144 ’s depiction of him as @entity145 – the @entity147 prophet of doom – saying ‘ @entity145 was right ’ that ‘ @entity149 would be overrun by the armies of @entity151 ’			2
mr @entity4 claimed : ‘ @entity152 ’s new @entity149 was overcome by an army of estate agents , property speculators and bankers			0
‘ the problem we now have is the invaders are back and they have a bridgehead in @entity161 and the south - east of @entity162 , and they have got to be stopped			0
’ the business secretary ’s outburst appalled even his own colleagues and was met with only muted applause from party members			1
one fellow @entity20 minister dismissed his speech as ‘ just awful ’			1
another said : ‘ to say that i was unimpressed would be an understatement			0
’ @entity24 mp @entity172 said : ‘ if @entity4 dislikes his own government so much the honourable thing to do would be to leave it			1
’ his colleague @entity176 branded mr cable ‘ infantile ’ and called for him to resign			0
he said : ‘ i ’m more than happy for @entity4 to be in opposition to his own government			0
just give up salary , red boxes and the flunkies first			0
‘ @entity20 forget that without the @entity24 they ’d still be a knit your own tofu pressure group rather than a responsible party of government			1
