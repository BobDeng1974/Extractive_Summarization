' people always questioned me , my family and friends were very upset but at that point i was n't going to stop			2
' i persuaded boyfriends to pay for treatment			0
i lied to get the money just like a drug addict would			0
' mother - of - two @entity2 first went under the knife aged 17 , lying to the surgeons about her age so that they would operate on her			1
since then she has spent over £ 1million on six nose jobs , 11 procedures on the skin around her eyes , cheek implants ( both adding and removal ) and a facelift as well as having a rib shortened to give her a slimmer silhouette , her toes shortened ‘ so they looked better in heels ’ , a tummy tuck , bottom implants , chin implants and 16 breast augmentations			1
she admitted herself to a rehabilitation centre in @entity62 twice to try in an effort to stem her surgery addiction , where she says she was the first case of her kind : ' i was the first person to go in to rehab for plastic surgery addiction , but they treated me like an alcoholic or drug addict			2
the model is urging women to avoid plastic surgery as she reveals that her addiction left her face so botched she could n't even smile at her newborn baby on monday the heartbroken blonde revealed that her face had been so damaged from too much surgery that she has n't been able to smile at her baby daughter @entity78 since she gave birth in 2011			1
@entity2 has two daughters , @entity81 , 17 , and 16 - month - old papaya			1
she told @entity83 : ' imagine holding your baby daughter for the for the first time and not being able to smile			1
' i have been so selfish			0
now my dream is for @entity78 one day to see her mummy smile back at her for the first time			1
' in a bid to fix her smile @entity2 , who has declared that she will not have any more surgery unless it is corrective , underwent a painful procedure that involved breaking her jaw and nose and having her ears cut off last week			1
last week she was seen with a swollen , bloodied face which was the result of a corrective operation to remove all of her facial implants @entity2 lays the blame for her addiction firmly at the feet of the surgeons who continued to operate on her despite the obvious signs of @entity105			1
she told host @entity107 : ' i am angry with the surgeons that have done this to me			0
i wish they had offered me counselling			0
i lied about my age , but i was a young girl and they did n't need to put me on that path			2
' you are playing with people 's faces and you are damaging their looks			2
i was a model , looks are everything to me			2
there are instances of people taking their own lives and i have felt like that at times			0
i have thought i ca n't take this any more , i ca n't live like this			2
the glamour girl started having plastic surgery aged 17 and has spent over £ 1million on her addiction comparing herself to @entity134 , the former model who was disfigured in an acid attack , glamour girl @entity2 says that her life has been ruined by ' attackers in white coats '			1
she says that she was blinded by the predatory surgeons who promised she would look ' perfect ' but instead turned her in to a walking sideshow : ' i often used that word			0
i took a @entity143 doll to one medical consultation to show them exactly what i was after			0
' i was unwell ; addicted to surgery			2
but none of those doctors tried to stop me			0
i think they just wanted my money			0
' @entity2 , seen in 2001 ( left ) and photographed at home in @entity153 in march 2013 ( right ) , has undergone over 350 operations including one to have her toes shortened @entity2 needs to have one more corrective operation to stop her face drooping , but she is urging other women never to have plastic surgery just to make themselves look better she added : ' i would n't let my daughters have surgery			1
they are beautiful just the way they are			0
do n't let your children have surgery , youth is beautiful in itself , spend any spare cash you have on counselling ( if they ask for a boob job ) , work on telling them how beautiful they are			2
' cosmetic surgeon dr @entity176 also appeared on this morning , and said : ' a surgeon has to make sure that the patient is having surgery for the right motives , but it 's not easy , a lot of patients lie about their medical history			1
' most surgeons do pick up telltale signs of dysmorphia and there are strict guidelines			0
i 'm sorry that it did n't happen in this instance			0
