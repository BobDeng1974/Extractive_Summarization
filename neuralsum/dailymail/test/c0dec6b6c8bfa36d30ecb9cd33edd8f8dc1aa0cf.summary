the title race may be over in the minds of some , but @entity3 is irrepressibly optimistic			1
of course , he is paid to believe but there is some logic to his positivity when you consider how @entity8 won the league in 2012 and 2014 with late dramatic runs			1
‘ it ’s kind of how we do it , ’ said @entity3 , when asked about @entity8 ’s need to overcome a nine - point deficit			1
‘ we like to do it a different way			1
we ’ve not necessarily reached the standard week - in , week - out that we wanted to , but the beauty of football is that you get another chance and that starts on monday at @entity22			1
‘ we ’ve got some massive games ; eight big games to reach a level that we need to reach			2
we ’ve not necessarily done that all season but we feel we are in the right place now			2
we have a lot of rest time and there are no excuses			2
everyone is fit and ready to go			2
we will never give up			1
’ @entity8 goalkeeper @entity3 insists his side are still capable of winning the @entity35 title @entity36 are nine points clear of @entity8 with both teams having eight games left to play @entity36 are nine points clear of @entity8 @entity3 is a good cheerleader			1
last week he won his 50th cap at the age of 27 and was immensely proud of his achievement			2
and his club may need his leadership now			2
at the @entity47 two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3 - 0 win over @entity51 , as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding @entity8 ’s trajectory but @entity3 does not accept that			1
‘ we ’ve proved it and the fans have proved it – we never give up , ’ he said			1
‘ that is one thing that is part of @entity8 that we ’ve taken with us from the olden days			1
we ’ll never give up while anything is possible			1
we ’ll go for it			2
‘ we have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012			1
that was a massive achievement but now we expect it of ourselves			2
we have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we ’ll give it all we ’ve got			1
’ @entity3 himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in			1
dropped last season by @entity74 and threatened this season by the £ 6million signing of @entity76 , @entity3 is playing as well as ever , his penalty save against @entity78 and the subsequent performance at the @entity80 a product of a long period of good form			1
@entity3 has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes ‘ i feel pushed , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i have personal pride			2
i think the world of @entity76			2
i think he is a fantastic goalkeeper and i know full well that if my standards drop , @entity76 will be in goal			2
that is how it is at @entity8			1
that is how it is with @entity95			2
i know it is the same thing here			0
i need to be on my toes and performing at a high level otherwise someone takes your spot			0
’ and @entity3 is not content with game , striving to better himself			1
‘ i can improve everything , management of the game			0
but i want to improve on everything and do n't just say that lightly			0
i look at everything i do			0
you do n’t set limits			0
i want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams i ’m with – @entity8 and @entity95			1
i hope the best is to come			0
that is what i ’ll be pushing to do			0
‘ every game is a rescheduled goal for me			0
i ’ve enjoyed the two games with @entity95 but i turn my head to @entity22 now			1
that is the next game for me and the one i ’m looking forward to			0
’ @entity3 labelled @entity116 , who won his 147th cap against @entity95 on tuesday night , a ' legend of the game ' and if he needed any inspiration in that quarter , a look across to his opposite number on tuesday night at the @entity121 would have provided it			1
as @entity3 won that 50th cap for @entity95 , @entity116 was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever			1
the @entity95 goalkeeper is a fan			0
‘ it ’s hard to look past @entity116			0
what a keeper – 147 caps , countless titles , the @entity129 , @entity131 trophies			0
what a goalkeeper and what a gentleman			0
he ’s real idol of mine and it ’s a real privilege to share a pitch with him			0
‘ i ’ve got a long way to go			0
but to see people like that at the top level is a real good feeling			0
i ’ve watched his career and how he is around people			0
it ’s a small amount of time you spend with people when you are in the tunnel with them but he oozes class			0
' he is a classy guy and it ’s great to have an icon like that			0
@entity156 played against @entity157 a few times and said the same thing			0
’ only in one area will @entity3 not be emulating @entity116			1
with his designer stubble , flowing hair , and his silk waist coat and designer shirt , @entity116 looked a little more like a successful artist or film - maker than a footballer as he left the @entity157 stadium			0
‘ he does look cool , ’ said @entity3 , with a degree of self deprecation			1
‘ i ’ll never try to be him			0
with my mousey blonde hair , it would n’t really work			0
