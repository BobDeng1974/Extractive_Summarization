by @entity0 football pundits are now a permanent part of the tv scene , dispensing their thoughts and theories in stadiums , studios and , at this @entity8 , rather inventively on @entity9			1
for many recently retired footballers it has become a lucrative second career , while for others it ’s a useful buffer between finishing playing the game and going back to it			2
so , it is fitting during a @entity8 in @entity19 to look back on the men who helped start the ‘ experts ’ ball rolling - in the year we saw @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity28 triumph in such glorious fashion			1
vive la difference ! their differences did n’t end there			2
@entity51 had @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity54 , while @entity34 put together their famous @entity8 panel in @entity56 : @entity57 and @entity59 ’s @entity58 , @entity60 and @entity62 ’s @entity61 ( @entity63 ) , and the gloriously extrovert @entity32			1
they would regularly wind each other up and @entity66 became the star turn			1
he had an answer for everything - or almost everything and @entity71 left back @entity72 , left out of sir @entity74 ’s @entity8 squad , was armed with a bell to ring when he wanted to get a word in edgeways			1
cover story : @entity44 captain @entity43 for @entity41 ( left ) and a model for @entity37 outspoken , irreverent , argumentative , occasionally bang out of order and good telly , the @entity34 panel created a real stir			1
and while the @entity51 still won all the big head - to - head battles , the viewers often turned to @entity34 on the final whistle to hear what the four musketeers — in kipper ties , flares and wide lapels — made of it all			1
they were a smash hit and with @entity95 and @entity35 firing the questions , things always got lively			2
@entity97 was never far away			2
@entity44 midfielder @entity31 , fresh home from having been knocked out of the @entity8 , went to the live studio and gave his chief critic @entity66 both barrels			1
he fished an @entity44 cap out of a plastic bag , thrust it in @entity66 ’s direction and said : ‘ i ’ve got 30 of these and this one ’s spare ’			1
for once , the uncapped @entity108 was speechless			0
these days , @entity8 punditry has become a little more ordered ( plastic bags are at a premium ! ) with greater immediate analysis of the action , more camera angles and technical gizmos to help illustrate a point more clearly			1
glory : @entity19 with @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity28 triumphed in 1970 the current choice of individuals on both channels reflects the wider world of football and there are still plenty of characters			0
but would n’t it have been fun to hear the most famous @entity8 panel ’s take on @entity44 ’s super-early exit , @entity132 ’s diving , the magnificence of @entity134 — and a certain @entity135 and his wandering teeth ? @entity72 , time to get the bell out mate ! confident : @entity138 as @entity34 pundit having watched football on tv for more than 50 years and worked at the top of the business for @entity51 and @entity145 , i have listened to some great pundits — and gave some of them their break in broadcasting			1
here are five who made the viewers sit up and take notice			0
@entity35 an absolute one - off			0
he starred on @entity154 and when he did @entity155 , he presented the programme and did the analysis ! awash with ideas , he has always had the integrity of the game at heart			0
i once told him he had finished top of a popularity survey among football presenters			0
‘ great , ’ he said			0
i then told him he had also finished top of an ‘ unpopularity ’ poll			0
‘ great as well , ’ he said			0
‘ the place not to finish in that type of thing is in the b * * * * y middle ! ’ @entity138 @entity174 , awkward , and self - opinionated , @entity138 was not short of self - confidence			0
it all made for compelling tv , even if it tripped him up — for example when he famously called the @entity181 goalkeeper @entity180 a ‘ clown ’ a few days before he had the game of his life against @entity44			1
as a young viewer i hung on his every word			0
class act : @entity51 pundit @entity187 @entity188 quirky , curious , independent , occasionally left - field and with a great career as a player and manager to back up his views			2
he ’s now the manager of the @entity194 but i gave him an early break in tv when @entity196 failed to show up for the @entity51 ’s coverage of the 1986 @entity8			1
@entity188 is currently providing interesting thoughts on the @entity8 for @entity34 from @entity9			1
@entity199 fresh out of the dressing room , bright , opinionated and articulate			0
he was interesting and forthright as a player and took all that enterprising thinking into a new career on @entity205			0
@entity187 took the class he showed as a player at @entity208 into his long career at the @entity51			2
@entity187 was nervous when he started but soon found his feet and has spent two decades dissecting goals and making perceptive comments			0
he retires after this @entity8 and will be missed .			2

@entity51 had *legendary* managers @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity54
@entity66 was the star turn of @entity34 's @entity8 panel
@entity44 midfielder @entity31 went to live studio to confront @entity66
