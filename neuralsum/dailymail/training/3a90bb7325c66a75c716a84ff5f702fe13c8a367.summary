myth : very few over- 65s are moving after retirement , and those that do stay in the same area moving to a quiet place in the countryside , by the coast or even abroad , might seem like the perfect retirement			1
but for most older people it seems the reality is a lot closer to home			0
despite winding up careers and no longer having young families to look after , millions of over- 65s prefer to stay exactly where they are			1
analysis by the @entity19 showed only a tiny number relocate – and most of those who do move house still stay in the same area or close by			2
the reluctance of older people to leave their neighbourhood was revealed in a study of 2011 national census figures			2
only 3.6 per cent of over- 65s said they had changed their address in the previous year and 57 per cent of those stayed within the same local authority boundaries			1
the findings come despite current retirees enjoying the financial benefits of five decades of rising house prices and of gold - plated final salary pensions , which have disappeared for most young people			0
older people who do move are likely to have reasons that include downsizing from a large family home , the need for personal or medical care , or the loss of a spouse or partner , the report said			1
increasingly , a husband or wife may be lost through a marriage break - up rather than death – 8.7 per cent of over- 65s are now divorced , compared with 5.2 per cent at the last census in 2001			1

‘ the grass is not always greener , and the beach is n’t always sandier			0
’ the @entity19 report said 5.8 per cent of the retirees who relocated in the year before the census had moved from abroad			1
it also found that for every 100 women over 65 who relocated , only 72 men did so			0
the @entity19 said this may be due to longer female life expectancy , leading to women downsizing into more manageable accommodation or ‘ to access residential care support ’			0
a new reason for older people staying put may be that they are delaying retirement , with one in ten over- 65s in employment or looking for a job , the report said			2
the most popular regions among movers were the @entity108 and the @entity109 , with 4.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively .			0
