@entity0 told @entity1 that she had both talent and personality bizarre , quirky but brilliantly entertaining , @entity6 's @entity5 has once again proved that no one does eccentricity quite like us			1
now , after weeks of mesmerising magicians and dynamic dance troupes , hundreds of contestants have been whittled down to the last 45			1
so who will pick up the Â£ 250,000 prize and perform at the @entity15 ? weekend meets six of the hopefuls still in with a chance ... the @entity19 you can see why posh @entity21 , 24 , struggled with life in an orchestra			1
she ca n't keep still for a second			1
' people think i 'm drunk most of the time , even when i 'm sober , ' she says			2
she won a standing ovation from the judges a few weeks ago when @entity0 told her , ' not only are you brilliant , but you have a fantastic personality as well			2
' and @entity31 says that 's driven her on			1
' being on @entity33 has given me so much encouragement			1
if i make it to the final i 'm going to play my own stuff and really surprise people			2
' @entity39 - born @entity31 demanded a violin from her parents at the age of four after seeing buskers playing them and composed her first tune on it in a day			2
she won a scholarship to the prestigious @entity47 of music but left after a year			1
' musicians are very competitive and focused while i just want to play because i love it , ' she says			2
she moved to @entity53 to teach windsurfing and spent her winters in @entity57 skiing and playing her violin on the roof of a nightclub , clips of which were posted on @entity61			2
she claims she is n't after fame and fortune			2
' i 'm worried about the environment so i 'd like to plant a tree for every gig i do , ' she says airily			2
' and i 'd love to encourage kids to leave their laptops alone			2
pick up an instrument instead ! ' the @entity70 dancer @entity71 , 79 , says her life 's been a whirlwind since her electrifying audition			1
in the early moments of her routine she was buzzed by @entity0 , but by the time her jaw - dropping performance with her @entity81 dance partner @entity80 was over he 'd repented , telling her , ' i apologise for buzzing a little early before all the crazy things happened - it went ballistic			1
' @entity84 adored her so much she pressed the golden buzzer , sending her straight through to the semi-finals			1
' it 's been manic ever since , ' says @entity71			1
' i could do with putting a bag over my head because so many people are asking for my autograph			2
' @entity71 was a professional dancer until the age of 22 but gave it up to have a family			2
she started again a decade ago after her husband @entity96 died of cancer 18 months after they 'd moved to @entity81			2
@entity80 ran the local dance school and he and @entity71 began performing together			2
they 've already won one @entity81 tv talent show , where she gave the @entity104 judge on that particular panel a piece of her mind			2
' he started having a go at @entity80 saying , " what do you think you 're doing hauling that old lady around ? " so i said , " your mother would be ashamed at what you 're saying ! " ' she recalls			2
' the audience went bananas			2
' she and @entity80 then decided to audition for @entity33 in @entity6			1
now she 's dreaming of performing at the @entity15 , especially if the @entity117 attends			1
' i would die happy knowing i 'd done that , ' she says with a smile			2
@entity71 , 79 , shocked the audience when she performed some very daring dance moves the ventriloquist with @entity123 @entity124 , 21 , admits that ventriloquism is an odd choice of career - but it 's the only thing that makes him happy			1
@entity124 , who 's from @entity128 in @entity129 , has suffered from @entity123 's syndrome all his life			1
he 's always come out with funny voices , and ventriloquism provides an outlet for them			1
' i 've always been obsessed with different characters and voices , ' he says			0
' what i love about ventriloquism is i can combine the two			0
' he taught himself from a library book when he was six , although as a keen magician too ( he auditioned for @entity33 several years ago doing magic ) , ventriloquism was only a sideline at first			1
but it gradually took over and he now has more than 20 puppets , although @entity147 - with whom he auditioned on last week 's show - has become his firm favourite			1
' he 's loveable but cheeky and mischievous			1
people seem to connect with him straight away , ' says @entity124			0
@entity124 still shows some signs of @entity123 's and hopes that he can help people be more sympathetic towards the condition			1
' i was bullied at school and things felt quite tough when i was growing up , ' he says			0
' but that 's over now ; i 've learned to be proud of my @entity123 's			1
a lot of people with @entity123 's control it with creativity ; they play the drums or piano			1
@entity165 has been through the puppets			0
you can still see it ; my head moves , my eyes blink and i still tend to shout out , but i would n't be me without this condition			0
' @entity172 have already earned a place in the semi-final after @entity175 pressed her golden buzzer during their performance the glamour @entity179 girlie trio @entity172 - @entity183 , 21 , @entity184 , 19 , and @entity185 , 16 - told judge @entity175 , who used to be in girl group @entity181 , she was their inspiration at their audition			0
@entity175 reciprocated by pressing the golden buzzer			0
and now they 're starting to think they have what it takes to be successful			0
they 've already had unwanted exposure when it was revealed that @entity183 , from @entity196 in south - west @entity197 , was once caught smuggling drugs to a boyfriend in jail			0
' that was a mistake i 'm going to regret for the rest of my life , ' she says			0
' i know people will judge me by it but i hope they can forgive me			0
' all three of them come from single - parent homes and have been singing all their lives			0
@entity211 and @entity185 , who are both from @entity212 , met on the local talent competition circuit			0
they were introduced to @entity183 , who was desperate to get into a girl band , by her cousin and instantly hit it off			0
' we 've been together for six months now and we could n't have asked for a better start , ' says @entity211			1
at their audition , @entity0 told them to work on their harmonies if they wanted to live up to the potential @entity175 saw in them			0
' we 've been practising like mad , ' says @entity211			0
' this is important for us ; we want to be the next @entity228			0
' @entity229 won the audience ( and @entity231 ) over with her quick wit the blue - @entity234 diva @entity237 , pink - haired @entity236 @entity235 does n't like to reveal her age			1
however , her friend ( and , it has to be said , the woman behind her success ) @entity243 from @entity244 reveals @entity229 is 34			0
how would @entity229 describe herself ? ' my style is influenced by the @entity247 but i 'm not affiliated to them			0
' @entity0 was so impressed with her audition he said he could see her in @entity84 's chair on the judging panel next year , but like many in showbusiness she 's an odd mixture of supreme confidence and crippling insecurity			1
the latter comes out when she wonders aloud whether she 's in the show ' because i 'm a token blue ; i hope they have n't put me through just be-cause of my colour			1
' although @entity229 is a talented singer she 'd quite like to find fame and fortune the easy way ; by marrying into it			0
' my favourite type of men are celebrities with money , ' she trills			0
' and they seem to like me			0
did you see me on this morning with @entity275 ? he went all shaky and stuttery			0
' she does n't have a favourite male celebrity in mind but reveals she 's already planning to drop @entity231 ( or @entity280 as she insists on calling them ) from her act after they performed with her at her audition			1
' i love them so much , ' she gushes			0
' but i 'm going to have to move on			0
i hope performing with me gave their careers a much - needed boost , though			0
' @entity288 , 15 , ticked all of @entity0 's boxes the @entity291 cute - as - a - cupcake with dimply cheeks and boyband hair , 15 - year - old @entity288 from @entity292 in @entity293 surely ticks all the boxes for @entity0			1
he sat his first gcse the day before we meet yet he earned a standing ovation from both the audience and judges at his audition with his unbelievable rendition of @entity306 's @entity305			1
today he 's hoping he not only does well in his exams , but can make the @entity6 's @entity5 final too			1
' i believe i 've got the potential to win it ... maybe , ' he says			0
' the thing i 'm most worried about is what @entity0 will say			0
he 's the one i want to impress most			1
he knows everything and if he does n't like me , i think i might just give it up			0
' despite the reception he got at his audition his parents are determined to keep his feet on the ground			0
' after i was on tv that first time my phone did n't stop ringing and i was looking at it constantly , so my mum took it away and told me it was all going to my head , ' he shrugs			0
' they 're also making me work really hard on my gcses			0
if the music does n't work out i need to be prepared to work in a bank or something boring			0
' with 30,000 new followers on @entity334 and a school full of girls suddenly going giggly when they see him , that 's looking highly unlikely			1
