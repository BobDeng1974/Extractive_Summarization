by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 08:36 est , 3 october 2012 change : culture secretary @entity1 wants to reduce the abortion limit to 20 weeks @entity4 ’s new minister for women called yesterday for a change in the abortion laws to reduce the deadline for terminations			1
culture secretary @entity1 , who is also in charge of women ’s issues and equalities policy , said the legal limit for abortions should be cut from 24 weeks to 20			1
she said advances in medical science mean many very premature babies can now be saved			1
the @entity19 mp , a mother of three , first voted for the change in 2008 when it was put forward in a backbench @entity22 by @entity19 mp @entity23			1
asked yesterday whether she still believed the reduction was necessary , she replied : ‘ absolutely			2
you have got to look at these matters in a commonsense way			0
‘ i looked at it from the really important stance of the impact on women and children			2
’ mrs @entity1 , who described herself as ‘ a very modern feminist ’ , said she was ‘ driven by the very practical impact that late - term abortion has on women ’			1
she added : ‘ what we are trying to do here is not to put obstacles in people ’s way but to reflect the way medical science has moved on			0
’ pro-abortion campaigners argue that few terminations are carried out after 20 weeks , usually on medical grounds			0
they see the drive to lower the deadline as an attack on wider abortion rights			0
they are already angry at the appointment as health secretary last month of @entity55 , who has voted for the abortion limit to be reduced to 12 weeks in the past			0
support : the proposal is supported by backbench @entity19 mp @entity23 , pictured , who is pushing for a fresh review of abortion limits this autumn @entity63 , of @entity64 , said : ‘ the fact that the minister responsible for women and equalities wants to restrict access to abortion , one of the most important women ’s health services , is really alarming			1
‘ her appointment , alongside @entity55 at the @entity74 , who would like to see abortion severely restricted , does nothing to inspire confidence in the government ’s commitment to women ’s right to choose			0
’ in an interview before the last election , mr @entity4 also backed calls for the abortion limit to be lowered to 22 weeks or 20 to take account of medical advances			1
the @entity74 stressed yesterday that it had ‘ no plans ’ to review the abortion laws , which are traditionally decided by votes of conscience in the @entity92			0
' we are trying to reflect the way medical science has moved on			0
’ - culture secretary @entity1 an aide to mrs @entity1 also said she was not pressing for action on abortion within government , but merely restating her ‘ strongly held view ’			1
but mrs @entity23 , who has led a series of attempts to change the abortion laws in recent years , said she would press for a fresh review this autumn			2
she praised mrs @entity1 for speaking out on the issue despite her ministerial position			2
‘ @entity1 is very strong and very brave to speak out in this way			2
‘ many ministers do not like to talk about the issue for fear of being targeted by pro-abortion campaigners , so i am delighted that she has made her views very clear			0
mrs @entity23 said the 24 - week limit was ‘ unsustainable ’ now that babies born earlier than this can sometimes be saved			1
‘ the facts have not changed since the 2008 vote – the problem is that @entity120 has so many socially liberal mps that it has become completely out of touch with public opinion			0
