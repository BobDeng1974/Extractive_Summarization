by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 15:15 est , 16 september 2013 it was far from a traditional wedding ceremony when @entity3 and @entity4 tied the knot			1
mainly because the groom used to be a woman and the bride used to be a man			0
and when the pair said ' i do ' last friday , they became the first couple to have a sex swap marriage in @entity15			1
sex swap marriage : @entity4 and @entity3 became @entity17 and mrs @entity18 after tying the knot in @entity20 happily married : the pair invited 13 people who had given them the most support to the ceremony both @entity3 and @entity4 have gone through sex change procedures and became @entity15 's first double sex swap married couple when they tied the knot on @entity20 , @entity31			1
they both had their reassignment operations on september 13 - @entity34 in 2003 and @entity4 in 2010 - so thought it would be fitting as the date for their wedding			2
the couple , who have been together for six years			2
were forced to change gender on their birth certificates before they could elope			0
before : @entity4 , who was a woman called @entity45 and was pregnant at the time of this photo ( left ) while @entity3 's old passport photo shows the facial hair she had when she was a man called @entity51 ( right ) @entity3 , 56 , who was a man known as @entity51 , and teaching assistant @entity4 , 46 , once @entity45 , have suffered four broken marriages between them and have 10 children			1
but after years of suffering @entity3 told the @entity56 the wedding was perfect and the dress had been something she dreamt about as a little girl			1
she said : ' i had butterflies during the service and i thought my knees would buckle under me			0
' and @entity4 , 46 , who wore a kilt , admitted he was almost knocked off his feet when he saw the bride approaching the altar			0
' i will love @entity3 forever			1
when i saw her coming down the aisle , i just thought ' wow '			0
' the pair met in 2008 after @entity4 confessed to his doctor that he was trapped in the wrong body			2
from the age of eight , he knew he wanted to become a man			0
as @entity45 , he got married at 22 and had two sons - but walked out after 13 years leaving his children behind			1
when he left his husband , he strapped down his @entity79 breasts so he could feel better about himself			0
@entity4 's @entity80 then sent him to a psychologist after hearing his story , who then put him in touch with transgender support group run by @entity3			1
a support worker at @entity87 , @entity3 was born a man called @entity89			1
she got married three times and fathered eight children while she was growing up , she had always wanted to be a girl , but her father 's position in the military made it tough for her to change gender			2
despite trying to suppress the urges , she cross-dressed in secret and , in the end , she opted for gender - reassignment treatment after the stress became too overwhelming			0
@entity3 's son @entity103 walked her down the aisle while @entity4 shook with nerves as he placed the ring on her finger			2
the couple , from @entity109 , chose just 13 people who have given them the most support to attend the ceremony			2
close friends @entity115 , 25 , and @entity116 , 49 , were chosen as bridesmaids while @entity118 , 40 , was best man			0
@entity3 and @entity4 say the most difficult part of their transitions was telling their children			1
@entity3 , told her two youngest children when they were only five and six years old , explaining that she was ill and could only get better if she became a woman			1
she said : ' the six - year - old was super cute and asked me if she could start calling me @entity127 instead of daddy			0
' her other two girls and four boys have slowly come around to the idea of the wedding			0
@entity4 became estranged from one of his sons after the sex change , but his other son @entity136 , 20 , was there to watch him tie the knot .			0

@entity3 and @entity140 met six years *ago* at a transgender support group
