’ sir @entity0 , 61 , continued : ‘ the risk of terrorism is becoming more and more dominant in our strategic vision for what we might do in @entity10			1
if that risk develops , we would almost certainly have to act to mitigate it and we are ready to do so			0
‘ i think it is a very big question			0
