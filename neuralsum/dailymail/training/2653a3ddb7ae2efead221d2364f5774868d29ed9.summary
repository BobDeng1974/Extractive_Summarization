@entity1 basketball player @entity0 shot back at a reporter who asked him if he knew where to find @entity4 on monday			1
' do you know where @entity4 is ? ' the @entity6 journalist asked @entity0			1
' no , ' the basketball center responded			2
' do you know where @entity11 is ? ' @entity0 hails from the @entity14 state - and it 's not clear how the journalist responded to his question			1
as a member of the @entity1 basketball team , @entity0 is set to play against @entity4 in the quarterfinals on tuesday for the @entity21			1
multiple fans have praised @entity0 for his cheeky reply on @entity24			1
@entity0 , in turn , asked the reporter if he knew where his home state of @entity11 is located ' geography bee ' : @entity0 , along with the @entity1 basketball team , is set to play against @entity4 in the quarterfinals tuesday ' swagged on em haha , ' one wrote			1
another user said ' @ boogiecousins you became my favorite bball player with your answer to the @entity4 journalist , good luck in the next game # usa			1
' ' greatest response in interview history # where is @entity11 , ' someone else tweeted			2
others wrote ' well done ' and called the response ' classic			0
' at least one media outlet expressed similar sentiments , with @entity49 saying ' @entity0 deserves credit for exposing the rank condescension at the root of this question			0
' ' the only reason to ask it is to expose the ignorance of the recipient , to indulge in a tired stereotype of the uneducated ( and almost always black ) @entity1 basketball player with no knowledge of the world outside of his immediate experience , ' the sports website said			1
@entity0 played basketball for both @entity66 and @entity67 high schools , @entity63 reported			1
though @entity4 's location on a map may be a mystery to the @entity1 basketball team , on the basketball court , the @entity1 know exactly where to look : on the perimeter			1
@entity75 and the @entity4 are a small team that thrives on the outside but struggles to defend the interior			2
the @entity1 will look to ride their size advantage to a victory on tuesday			1
the teams met in an exhibition game just before the tournament , and the @entity1 cruised to a 101 - 71 victory			1
@entity85 scored 18 points and @entity87 added 14 as the @entity1 big men dominated their undersized foes			2
' they do not defend in their normal practice a lot of the stuff that we do , so they 're not accustomed to being inside , ' @entity1 coach @entity90 said on monday			0
' so our guys have to take advantage of that			0
not so much posting , but for offensive rebounds			0
' geography : though @entity0 indicated he does n't know where @entity4 is , it 's not clear if the @entity6 journalist knows where @entity0 ' home state of @entity11 is did it look like this ? this photo of @entity0 speaking to the media has surfaced on @entity24 , reportedly showing his reaction to the reporter 's geography question @entity90 was quick to note that the @entity4 were managing @entity114 's minutes in the exhibition and that they have since improved			1
' but for us , too , we 've gotten better since then , ' @entity90 said			0
and @entity4 has n't gotten bigger			0
only five players on its roster are 6 - foot - 7 or taller , while the @entity1 roster lists eight players who are at least that big			2
the @entity1 had a whopping 50 - 22 advantage in points in the paint in the first game , though the 6 - foot - 11 @entity126 would n't say that bigger always means better			2
' @entity4 's a tough team			1
it does n't really matter the size i would say , ' he said			0
' everybody has a different type of playing style and i think our playing style kind of wore them down			0
so hopefully we could do that the next game as well			0
' @entity0 was n't much of a factor then , but has emerged as a powerful weapon off the bench for the @entity1			1
he has scored in double figures in each of the last three games , and shot 5 for 5 in two of them , including saturday 's 86 - 63 victory over @entity147			1
@entity4 advanced with a 71 - 61 victory over the @entity149 behind 12 points from @entity151 , the @entity153 ' star point guard , and 18 from his brother , @entity154			1
slam dunk : @entity0 hangs over the net while playing @entity147 during the @entity157 on saturday the @entity4 went into the final day of the group stage in position to avoid the @entity1 until the semifinals , but their loss to @entity162 , following @entity164 's loss to @entity165 , dropped @entity4 into the other half of the @entity1 bracket			1
the basketball governing body @entity168 is investigating @entity164 's loss because it appeared the players may have stopped trying to defend late			0
the loss moved the @entity164 out of a potential quarterfinal matchup with the @entity1 , however they lost the first elimination game to @entity174			0
' it 's too bad that we have now @entity1 , but of course we can not do nothing			2
we just go to face them and try to win , ' @entity179 said			0
with the @entity75 brothers leading the way , @entity90 said the @entity4 can put five 3 - point shooters on the floor at one time			2
but if they 're not hitting , the @entity1 can swarm @entity75 , as it did in holding him to 3 - for - 11 shooting in the exhibition rout			2
@entity75 was in foul trouble that night , as were plenty of teammates who struggled to defend bigger players			0
the @entity1 shot 46 free throws , while @entity4 was just 10 of 17			1
the winner will face @entity162 or @entity174 on thursday night			0
@entity90 said the @entity1 have to forget the warmup game , and @entity87 said there was no game plan to pound the ball inside like last time			0
as for the basketball cliche that a good big team beats a good small team ? ' we 'll see what happens tomorrow , ' @entity87			0
' if we win , then hey , the cliche is right			0
but if we do n't , then hey , the cliche was wrong			0
so we do n't know			0
