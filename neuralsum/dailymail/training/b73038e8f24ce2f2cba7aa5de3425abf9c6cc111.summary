@entity1 star @entity0 has hailed the ' exceptional ' ability of @entity5 try machine @entity3			1
both players are set to be among the major box - office attractions when @entity1 host the @entity5 next saturday			1
between them , they have scored 48 test tries , but @entity11 ’s fellow wing @entity3 has 29 of those from just 32 international appearances			1
@entity5 and @entity14 winger @entity3 has scored 29 tries in 32 test matches it is a staggering strike - rate , and one that is not lost on @entity11			1
he is a brilliant example of how to impose yourself on a game , ' @entity0 said			1
' he pops up left , right and centre			0
you have to watch to work out what to do , but learn from him as well			0
' the @entity5 have shown over the past few weeks that they can win @entity24 matches when they are really feeling the heat			2
@entity3 is widely regarded as the best winger in the world at present and has been compared to @entity28 ' they are deservedly number one in the world , and we have to step up our game massively for the weekend			1
” wales have not beaten @entity5 since 1953 , and given the sub-standard nature of their performance against @entity38 two days ago , they will not be widely expected to end that long losing sequence this time around			1
although @entity1 defeated the @entity41 17 - 13 - @entity11 was among their try - scorers - they did not register a point after half - time despite @entity38 having prop @entity45 sent off			1
' you are aware of what ’s coming , and you work even harder , ' @entity0 added			2
' there is no bigger challenge than the @entity5			2
@entity0 crosses for an early try against @entity38 last saturday but @entity1 stuttered to a 17 - 13 victory ' the @entity5 have a great game - plan			1
they ’ve got players who can get over the gain - line , and they ’ve got boys who are very good in the air and have great skills			0
they wo n’t bring anything less than that on the weekend			2
' the boys are really excited for the next two games ( against @entity5 and @entity61 )			2
' it was n’t ideal to go into this game on the back of that performance against @entity38 , but it is better to go in with a win rather than a loss			1
@entity70 's side have a huge fortnight ahead of them when they face the @entity5 and @entity61 ' everyone has held their hands up and we ’ve said that we need to do better			1
we went out there believing in how we were set up and how we wanted to play , but we just did n’t get into our own rhythm			0
' you do n’t want to make eye contact with anyone in the debrief after a match like that			0
' it ’s part of the job			0
you are flying high on the good days and want to talk to everyone , but when the dark days come and you have n’t been performing , you have to man up and take it on the chin			0
' a few boys , myself included , know that we did n’t perform as well as we should have with the space and time we had			0
you kick yourself when you look back over a lot of things , but you have to take it on the chin and make it right in the next game			0
' everyone involved on the weekend knew that the turnovers came from silly mistakes and they were schoolboy errors			0
the players are harder than anyone on themselves			0
' i am very hard on myself , and those basic skills should n’t be a worry at this level			0
we had 23 turnovers from knock - ons , and you ca n’t afford to do that at this level with @entity5 and @entity61 coming up			2

all @entity5 winger @entity3 has scored 29 tries in 32 test appearances
wales have not beaten @entity5 since 1953
