by @entity1 reporter published : 12:35 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 23 september 2013 accused : midwife @entity2 has been accused of negligent homicide for the death of a baby an unlicensed midwife who was sued for a baby 's death in @entity9 has now been charged with negligent homicide in a second newborn 's death after moving to @entity12			1
@entity2 , 71 , oversaw a home birth in @entity14 on august 17 but the baby suffered oxygen deprivation and his mother nearly bled to death after the midwife allegedly administered prescription drugs and procedures - such as a ' vacuum ' to pull out the baby - that she was not licensed to carry out			1
@entity12 allows lay , unlicensed midwives to practice legally , as long as they are assisting in a low - risk natural birth			1
this is not @entity26 's first brush with the law			2
another family sued her for the death of their child in 1993 and other mothers have claimed she was forceful and carried out painful procedures - with one branding the aggressive , involuntary treatment ' rape ' , the @entity28 reported			1
she began practicing in @entity38 in the 1970s and carried out home births for seven years there - although lay midwifery is illegal in the state			2
in 1983 , she was charged in @entity43 with two felony counts of practicing medicine without a license and a charge of illegally possessing a hypodermic syringe , according to the @entity49			0
she pleaded guilty but told reporters that she planned to move to @entity51 , where she was allowed to practice legally			1
@entity51 has since passed restrictions for unlicensed midwives			0
she worked in the state and then trained interns in @entity56 before opening a center in @entity9			2
scene : the newborn died at @entity60 in @entity61 in august after @entity26 allegedly carried out procedures and administered drugs she was not licensed to use but in 1993 , her center was smacked with a lawsuit after patient @entity66 , from @entity67 , lost one of her twins , accusing the midwife of failing to call 911 quick enough			1
the baby , @entity71 , was taken away by staff just hours after her birth - and three weeks later she died			0
doctors told her they did not know if @entity71 would have survived if she 'd been born in hospital			0
' @entity2 wasted , like , a whole hour , ' @entity66 told the @entity28			2
she had this ego : she was the guru of birth			0
@entity2 knew there was a problem , and she withheld the information from us			2
' @entity66 sued @entity82 and said she received a $ 1 million default judgment , but attorneys said @entity85 was ' uncollectable , ' as non-nurse midwives are not required to carry malpractice insurance			1
another patient , @entity88 from @entity89 , @entity9 , sought @entity26 's help with her birth in 1996 but endured a painful experience , she told the @entity28			1
the most horrifying part came when the midwife used a ' vacuum ' to pull out her child			0
' it was the single most painful thing @entity98 did during my birth , ' @entity88 said			0
' she had both of her hands inside me			0
i was yelling at her to get them out , but she refused because she was helping			0
if someone has two hands in you , and you 're telling them no , and they do n't stop - that 's why i call it a rape			2
' @entity26 had become a @entity111 in 1996 - but was stripped of her certification in 2001 when a panel found she had strayed outside her ' scope of practice '			1
she then moved to @entity12 and continued practicing as an unlicensed midwife			1
problematic : another mother in @entity9 sued @entity82 for the death of her daughter , while others have claimed she carried out painful procedures and ignored their pained cries ( file picture ) in the most recent case in @entity12 , she participated in the birth after meeting with the mother - who has not been named - four times			1
the mother was a high - risk pregnancy as she had previously had three c - sections - but @entity85 allegedly told her that she had substantial experience performing vaginal births with women who had undergone such procedures			1
she is not legally allowed to carry out high - risk births			0
@entity2 has overseen thousands of births across the country and finally settled in @entity12 , where it is not illegal for her to carry out midwife services without a license			1
the @entity28 noted that @entity12 allows three types of midwives : nurse midwives who have the equivalent of a master 's degree and work alongside doctors @entity111 - a title given out by the @entity151 of midwives , which is the status of home birth midwives in the state			2
they can use some prescription drugs but may only take low - risk clients there are also unlicensed , lay midwives in the state			0
they are not regulated by any professional body but they are allowed to conduct home births that are low risk and natural @entity12 code requires them to limit their practice ' to a normal pregnancy that is low risk at the start of labor and remains low risk throughout the course of labor and delivery ' - a code which the lawsuit claims @entity26 broke			1
@entity51 also shared the same attitude towards voluntary licensing until this summer , when it passed restrictions			0
thirteen other states , from @entity184 to @entity185 , neither license nor forbid non-nurse midwives and in 10 states , non-nurse midwives may not practice legally , the @entity28 noted			1
on august 17 , she reportedly administered a prescription drug to the 41 - year - old mother , claiming it was from her pharmacist son , yet she was not licensed to do so			1
the drug , @entity196 , has been known to cause uterine rupture or other complications when administered to pregnant women , court documents noted			0
the mother received three more doses			0
@entity85 allegedly tried to speed up the birth and gave the mother a painful examination			0
at one point , she checked the baby 's pulse and it slowed down before becoming normal again			0
the mother began to vomit and have diarrhea , and after about an hour , the baby 's heartbeat could no longer be heard			0
the midwife ' panicked and grabbed a ... " vacuum " , attached it to the newborn 's head and pulled the newborn from the mother with one pull ' , court documents state			2
the baby came out with its umbilical cord wrapped around its body , which was blue			0
he was not breathing and @entity82 performed cpr on the baby as 911 was called			0
the mother hemorrhaged four cups of blood , and @entity26 tried to suture her , which she was not licensed to do , court documents allege			1
the mother was taken to @entity230 where doctors learned that the vacuum had caused ' profound trauma ' to the mother 's vaginal area that would have soon led to her death			2
she received blood and plasma and was flown to a hospital in @entity240 , @entity241 , where she received transfusions that saved her life			0
but her newborn died a week later at hospital from oxygen deprivation			1
@entity85 has been charged with unlawful conduct , which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison , and with negligent homicide and reckless endangerment , which each carry one year			1
@entity85 , from @entity254 , told the @entity255 that she was very upset by the allegations , adding that ' most of it is untrue '			0
in a previous interview with a @entity9 newspaper , @entity85 said that she was made for midwifery			2
' they 'll have to cut off my hands to stop me , ' she said .			1

@entity2 is charged with negligent homicide after ' she administered drugs and carried out procedures she was not licensed to use '
the @entity12 newborn died and his mother almost bled to death
@entity26 was previously sued for $ 1 million in death of a @entity9 newborn but moved to @entity12 where she can practice legally
@entity26 : ' they 'll have to cut off my hands to stop me '
