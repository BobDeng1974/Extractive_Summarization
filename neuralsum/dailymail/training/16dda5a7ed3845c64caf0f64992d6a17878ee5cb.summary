hand transplants are being denied to @entity4 patients because of a bureaucratic @entity6 row , @entity1 ’s leading expert said last night			1
in the meantime , @entity8 patients can jump the queue and be treated in @entity11 while the dispute drags on			1
professor @entity13 performed the @entity1 ’s first hand transplant a year ago on former pub landlord @entity15 , 52			1
potential hand transplant patients are being denied surgery because of a funding row , says the surgeon who performed the first transplant surgery on @entity15 ( pictured ) last year			1
mr @entity15 is progressing well success : mr @entity23 's doctors say they are very pleased with his progress			0
he is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand professor @entity28 and his team at @entity30 performed the pioneering operation on @entity15 , who is gradually regaining feeling in his hand			1
but no further operations have since been carried out - despite two patients being assessed as suitable for the procedure			2
it may not be until 2015 until these patients can undergo surgery and the delays follow the biggest - ever reconfiguration of the @entity6			1
clinical commissioning groups ( @entity43 ) , which have been given charge of the bulk of @entity6 spending - including hand transplant surgery - are refusing to finance the operations , claiming it is the responsibility of @entity11 which pays for specialised care			1
the funding dispute is believed to be among a number due to the complex shake - up in april			0
internationally - renowned specialist professor @entity28 , who heads the transplant team in @entity56 , said he was frustrated at the delay			1
both patients , one from the @entity59 and another from @entity60 , could be operated on ' immediately ' if funding of £ 66,000 for the first year was available , with further life - time costs mainly for anti-rejection drugs running into several thousand pounds a year			2
frustrated : because of the funding row , professor @entity28 says he will most likely operate on a @entity8 patient next - in @entity11 ' we are saying this is clearly the responsibility of the @entity43 , ' said professor @entity28 , ' if they want to say no to it , they have to give a good clinical reason and there is n't one			1
' surgery would be life transforming for both patients			0
we could go ahead now - we are up and ready to go			0
' @entity11 have been very constructive			2
the people who have n't got up to speed are the @entity43 in this respect			0
we certainly hope it can be resolved			0
they really do need to understand the value for their patients and move quickly			0
' instead , a patient from @entity8 is likely to be the next to undergo a transplant in the summer as funding north of the border - which has had no re-organisation - is still available			1
professor @entity28 added : ' it will mean a @entity8 patient will have treatment in @entity11 when an @entity4 patient ca n't at the moment			1
it really does need to be sorted out			0
' the team say they are very pleased with the progress of mr @entity15 , of @entity99 , @entity100 , who is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand			2
mr @entity15 , 52 , a former pub landlord , said : ' it 's something i 've been very proud to have			0
i think it 's super			0
' he left the infirmary three weeks after the transplant but regularly attends the hospital for physiotherapy , occupational therapy and psychology , as well as checks from the team			2
@entity11 said : ' the specialised services that are the responsibility of @entity11 are set out in regulations and are determined by ministers			2
other hospital services are the responsibility of @entity43 , including , at present , hand transplant			1
" ministers are looking at whether , during the next phase of deciding which services will be specialised , this service should become a prescribed service			0
' in the meantime it remains the responsibility of @entity43 to decide whether this surgery should be funded or not			0

professor @entity13 performed the first hand transplant last year
his team at @entity30 have now *approved* two more ops
but a row has broken out over who will fund the operations
@entity6 @entity11 says the local funding board should pay and vice versa
*situation* means a @entity8 patient will be next to benefit from @entity56 surgery
