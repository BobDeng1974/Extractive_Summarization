for @entity4 , the strain of bearing @entity2 hopes at @entity3 manifests itself in strange ways			1
on tuesday it was a case of lockjaw			2
nerves meant the resurgent @entity2 no 1 was so uptight she was not just sleepless in @entity11 , which is normal for her , but also incapable of opening her mouth ahead of her first round			1
happily the anxiety evaporated once she walked on court to meet @entity20 ’s highly rated @entity19 , and she was able to avoid the possibility of a tuesday wipeout for the host nation with an ultimately comfortable 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 victory			2
serene : @entity4 eased into the second round with victory over @entity19 thumbs up : @entity4 salutes the crowd after her straight - sets win at @entity3 the overmatched @entity29 and @entity30 were never likely to register a tick on the credit ledger for @entity33 but the 22 - year - old @entity34 was burdened with expectation , especially in the absence of @entity37			1
‘ i was a bit nervous and struggled to eat before i went on , actually my jaw was locking and i could n’t even bite through my banana , ’ said a beaming @entity4 after her match			1
‘ it ’s just tension , i always get nervous but sometimes more than others and that ’s never happened before			2
i did n’t sleep that great last night , i woke up at 4am , and i was ready to go			2
i did actually manage to get back to sleep for a bit			2
the sleeping thing is normal , more since i have been ill ( with the glandular fever that helped wreck last season for her )			2
so it ’s usually just that and struggling to eat			2
’ the slump of 2013 means she has almost no points to defend between now and the end of the year , so with the way she is playing there can be every expectation that @entity4 will soon break back into the top 50			1
that process would be accelerated if she could somehow defeat ninth seed @entity64 @entity63 tomorrow			1
@entity4 ’s mantra is that anyone can beat anyone in women ’s tennis right now , so that outcome is just about possible			1
next round here i come : @entity4 has been in fine form in recent weeks , and faces @entity63 next fair game : @entity4 and @entity75 shake hands at the end of the match you know you will get nothing less than wholehearted fight from the newly attacking version of @entity4 , and that showed through in her ability to fend off break points that her opponent , ranked eight places higher at 52 , created in the first set			1
that extra edge is partly a product of her tennis upbringing being outside the norm , having taken herself off to @entity95 ’s tennis academy in @entity96 at the age of 12			0
it is notable that the three @entity2 survivors into the second round have all largely done their own thing in their development			1
@entity103 has long been an outsider from any centralised system and @entity106 has rarely ever been a part of it — who knows , the @entity109 might just discern a message in there somewhere			0
the @entity109 did provide financial support , it should be said , but after @entity4 helped spare the organisation ’s blushes by winning , she extolled the virtues of branching out on her own			1
‘ i could n’t stay in @entity118 and when i went to visit @entity95 i knew it was the place for me , ’ she said			0
‘ one of the reasons was that the weather was very good and also it was so competitive			0
but the weather plays a big part			1
’ interestingly , @entity4 revealed that she has never been asked by the powers that be about why the @entity96 experience has been so beneficial			1
tough : @entity127 blew @entity30 away on tuesday 194 : @entity128 beat @entity129 in four sets over 194 minutes — the longest match			1
7 : @entity132 is highest seed to go out 22 : @entity135 ’ @entity3 debut lasted 22 minutes as he was forced to retire 18 : @entity136 hopes to win an 18th @entity137 71 : @entity103 will earn £ 71,000 if she beats @entity138 63 : @entity139 is playing in her 63rd @entity137 event 50 : @entity141 is the fourth man in history to compete in 50 consecutive @entity143 slams 22 : @entity144 has won her last 22 first - round matches at @entity137 one trusts that this might happen with the arrival of veteran coaching guru @entity149 at the @entity109 as head of player development			2
a key appointment of @entity155 chief executive @entity154 , the @entity152 speaks with a velvet voice but wields a well - disguised iron fist			0
there could be no complaining about the efforts put in by @entity30 and @entity160 , two grafters whose struggles around the bleaker outposts of the circuit were rewarded with the financial bonanza of the £ 27,000 minimum in prize - money that comes with a wildcard			0
not only are there such luxuries as chauffeur - driven transport at events like @entity3 , their financial reward exceeds the total pot on offer at some of the tournaments in which they play			0
the closest @entity106 has ever got to @entity179 1 has been purely as a fan , or as a temporary employee of the @entity182 seven years ago when she worked in the office handing out accreditation badges			0
now she was out there against the unforgiving figure of tournament second - favourite @entity127 whom , after a few close early games , she managed to detain for 58 minutes before succumbing 6 - 1 , 6 - 0			0
too big : similarly , @entity189 could n't quite match up to @entity191 @entity190 at the start of may it was the proud boast of @entity194 , a 23 - year - old from @entity196 , that he had won more professional matches in 2014 than any other player , even if they came very much on the lower tiers			1
his reward on his @entity137 debut was to face the gargantuan serve of 6ft 9in @entity191 no 1 @entity190 , something he described as ‘ ridiculous , he looks so casual it ’s hard to tell what he is planning to do with it ’			0
@entity29 added : ‘ i did n’t realise the crowd would get into it so much			0
i was overwhelmed by that			0
i ’ve never had a crowd backing me like that before			0
that was a great experience			0
maybe i was a bit too intense in the first set , that ’s something i need to learn in best of five matches			0
’ he handled the occasion well early on and created three break points at 3 - 3			0
the third was saved with a 134mph ace which , as @entity129 — @entity190 ’s opponent in the 70 - 68 marathon in 2010 — could tell him , is just how it goes sometimes			0
@entity4 could yet be joined by another @entity224 in the second round after @entity226 levelled late in the evening to finish at 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 against the beaten 2010 finalist @entity227			1
the talented but under - achieving @entity2 no 6 , faced with a player who has won only one match this year due to persistent shoulder injuries , fought back from 3 - 1 in the tiebreak to take it into a deciding set on wednesday .			1

@entity4 was in *impressive* form in reaching the second round
she is only the second @entity2 woman to make it through a match this year
@entity4 plays @entity63 in the second round
