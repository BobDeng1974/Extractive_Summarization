by @entity0 for @entity1 a ten - year - old boy who can barely walk due to a rare spine condition is hoping to complete a 4km run - and step out of his wheelchair to walk across the finish line			1
@entity6 will join thousands of other children tackling the @entity8 run in @entity9 this weekend but for the 10 - year - old , just reaching the start line is an achievement			1
@entity6 , from @entity13 in @entity14 , was born with @entity16 ’s syndrome , a rare genetic condition which causes dislocation of the bones			1
@entity6 , 10 , can barely walk due to @entity16 's syndrome - which causes dislocation of bones - but that wo n't stop him completing the @entity23 this weekend , and stepping out of his wheelchair to cross the finish line his mother @entity25 ( pictured left ) was terrified when @entity6 ( pictured left and right ) had to undergo a seven - hour operation in which doctors predicted there was just a 15 per cent chance he would survive without dying , being paralysed , or requiring a ventilator for the rest of his life after seeing his mother @entity25 , 33 , complete the @entity23 last year he decided that although he may finish last , his condition would not stop him stepping over the finish line			1
' i love the @entity37 , ' he said			0
‘ on saturday i ’ll come in last - i hope i still get a medal - but i want to get up and go across the finish line			1
’ at just 14 months old @entity6 ’s spine became dislocated and his vertebrae began pushing down on his spinal cord , threatening to paralyse him			1
he underwent pioneering surgery at @entity44 , in which four of his neck bones were removed and replaced with one of his lower left ribs			2
a second operation then attempted to fuse the rib to the rest of his spine , meaning he was forced to wear a ‘ halo ’ to ensure he could not move his head for months on end			2
@entity16 syndrome is a rare genetic condition that affects the development of bones throughout the body			1
affected individuals are usually born with inward and upward turning feet and dislocations of the hips , knees and elbows and flexible joints			2
some people with the condition experience respiratory problems as a reuslt of weakness of the airways , that can lead to partial closing and short pauses in breath			0
the condition affects around one in 100,000 newborns			0
other symptoms of the disease include : his neck became so fragile that , aged three , he tripped over a plant pot and snapped the newly - grafted rib			0
doctors fitted him with metal rods to support his head , but the procedure led to further problems			0
‘ when he broke the rib doctors put in metal rods at the front of his neck to support it , but when he grew the metal could n’t change and he ended up with both a compression and decompression of his neck , ’ said mrs @entity25			0
he went under the knife again , with surgeons at @entity99 ’s @entity98 predicting just a 15 per cent chance that he would survive the procedure without dying , being paralysed or requiring a ventilator for the rest of his life			1
mrs @entity25 said she was terified , not knowing what would happen to her son			0
she said : ‘ the operation took seven - and - a - half hours and when he came out he could n’t move - we did n’t know what would happen			0
’ months of physiotherapy and orthopaedic therapy followed , with support from friends and his family			0
now @entity6 is all set for the run this weekend			1
he is fundraising to say thank you to the @entity119 , which in both @entity9 and @entity99 provided a ‘ home away from home ’ for his mum and dad while he was undergoing treatment			2
he has already raised £ 500 smashing his fundraising target of £ 150			1
by the time he steps out of his chair on saturday , he hopes to have raised hundreds more			0
