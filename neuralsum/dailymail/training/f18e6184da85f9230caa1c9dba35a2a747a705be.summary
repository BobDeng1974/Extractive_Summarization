@entity0 has axed plans for a sprawling film studio on farmland north of @entity4 because he does n't want his company to be seen as ' an evil empire			0
' @entity7 , the force behind the @entity10 franchise , surprised officials in @entity12 by pulling the plug on the controversial @entity15 project citing bitter opposition from neighbours and delays in the approval process			1
the axed plans included a 269,000 - sq ft digital media studio , a 51 - ft tall mission - style compound with two 85 - ft towers , two indoor sound stages and an outdoor stage of nearly 7,000 sq ft. there would have been screening rooms , guest housing , a general store , employee cafeteria and wine cave for private tastings and storage at the venue about 15 miles north of the @entity35			0
axed : an artist 's impression shows the now axed plans for a sprawling studio in @entity12 , near @entity4 , @entity40 , which would have created hundreds of jobs moving on : @entity0 ' company @entity7 said in a statement that it had withdrawn the plans because it wished to be seen as a ' creative asset , not as an evil empire ' @entity7 and its backers argued the new production studio would generate hundreds of high - paying jobs and tax revenue and hoped to break new ground next year			1
but yesterday they decided to withdraw from the 25 - year battle			2
' we love working and living in @entity12 , but the residents of @entity56 have fought this project for 25 years , and enough is enough , ' the company said in a statement			1
' we have several opportunities to build the production stages in communities that see us as a creative asset , not as an evil empire			0
' the company said it would construct new facilities elsewhere and hoped to sell the historic farmland to a developer interested in building low - income housing in the region			0
local business leaders who championed the project said they were devastated by the announcement			1
' it sends a very disturbing message to any company thinking about growing or starting in @entity12 , ' said @entity76 , president of the @entity77			2
' it 's a model project			0
if this project ca n't get approved , i do n't know what project can get approved			0
' the @entity15 project would have marked a major expansion of @entity7 in @entity56 , which has been home to its @entity85 for three decades - the valley is named after a 19th century rancher with no relation to the @entity10 creator			1
but the project generated strong opposition from homeowners and environmentalists who said it would increase traffic , noise and environmental damage on the pristine countryside , despite company promises to preserve open space and reduce impacts on the community			1
the @entity12 planning commission unanimously approved the studio project in february , but opponents appealed that decision to the county board of supervisors last month , leading to further delays			1
picturesque : campaigners against the project said it would have an adverse effect on the stunning @entity56 landscape by creating more traffic , noise and environmental damage @entity119 countryside : the @entity15 project would have nestled in @entity56 , in @entity12 , @entity40 , about 15 miles north of @entity4 's @entity35 ' the level of bitterness and anger expressed by the homeowners in @entity56 has convinced us that , even if we were to spend more time and acquire the necessary approvals , we would not be able to maintain a constructive relationship with our neighbours , ' @entity7 said in the statement			1
@entity130 , president of the @entity131 , said she was surprised by the decision			0
' we are glad we do n't have to worry about the potential impacts we were worried about , ' she said			0
' we do n't want to describe it as good news or bad news , but i can understand why another location would be better for this type of facility			0
' @entity141 said any proposed housing development on the property would have to be ' suited to the zoning , the people who live here and the people who come here			0
' @entity7 spokeswoman @entity148 said two cities have contacted the company offering ' substantial incentives ' to build the new studio , but she could not discuss specific locations			1
' it makes me sad that we can not build the studio in @entity12 , ' @entity154 said			2
' other communities understand the economic and educational benefits of having a company such as @entity7 in their cities			2
