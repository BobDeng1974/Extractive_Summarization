the great @entity0 watches farce continued when football powerbrokers @entity2 and @entity4 joked about their contrasting responses after being ordered to return their £ 16,400 @entity6			1
the watches were given as gifts by @entity10 ’s football federation to delegates at the @entity12 in @entity13 , but @entity0 ethics chief @entity14 has ruled that they be sent back to @entity15			1
@entity16 president @entity2 , who had a laugh with @entity18 chairman @entity4 about the pantomime while on a train to @entity21 , has sent his watch back despite saying he would not do so because he does n’t believe in returning presents			1
@entity4 , though , still intends to auction his watch for the benefit of the @entity18 cancer charity and has informed @entity14 of that decision in writing for a second time			1
@entity2 poses with @entity4 at @entity21 and the pair joked about their posh watches @entity2 was relaxed and the @entity31 sauntered across the indoor pitches at the national football centre @entity14 had earlier warned @entity4 he could face disciplinary action if the watch was n’t posted back to @entity0			1
but @entity4 , rightly , is not prepared to be dictated to on such a petty issue			1
@entity14 ’s deadline for retrieving the watches was october 24 , but there is still no word from him on how many of the 65 were handed back , or on those threatened sanctions			2
meanwhile , it did n’t do much for @entity44 ’s standing as @entity16 ’s favourite location for their marquee matches when it took @entity2 three hours to travel from @entity48 to @entity50 ’s @entity49 for the @entity52 match against @entity53 on tuesday night			1
@entity54 , who control the referees , are doing themselves no favours with their lack of transparency when they are under the spotlight after banning @entity61 for not travelling with his assistants after a game			2
elite assistant referee @entity69 , at the centre of the sexism storm involving former @entity67 pair @entity66 and @entity68 , has n’t been selected for any match this season			2
@entity54 will say only that she is ‘ injured ’ but has not failed any fitness tests			2
@entity73 , @entity75 ’s new head of global commercial activities , is yet to meet @entity77 , despite , one would imagine , busy @entity78 making that a priority			1
a @entity75 spokesman said their paths had not crossed due to the nature of their jobs rather than @entity77 remembering anything @entity73 said about @entity75 when he was @entity86 ceo			1
@entity73 ( left ) pictured during his @entity86 pomp , alongside commercial director @entity88 @entity91 @entity90 owner @entity89 regards the number 17 as unlucky , to the extent that it has been taken off the shirt , squad list and an executive box at @entity97			1
so the chances of @entity99 attending saturday ’s match against @entity101 look slim			0
@entity90 have 17 points after scoring 17 goals and the next match is their 17th of the @entity107 season			0
@entity109 case haunts @entity18 the @entity18 only giving referees chief @entity109 diversity training after he made a ghastly racist comment to a colleague , continues to embarrass the governing body			0
@entity115 , the @entity18 vice-president rightly banned for telling young referee @entity116 that a ‘ woman ’s place is in the kitchen ’ , is appealing over the severity of his sentence compared with @entity122 ’s			0
@entity115 said : ‘ does it seem fair that i get a four - month ban and a £ 250 fine and @entity109 gets a slap on the wrist			2
i want a fair punishment for what i ’ve said and what ’s been said elsewhere			0
’ @entity109 , a former housemaster at @entity130 , came under fire for his controversial comments @entity133 , @entity134 ’s head of golf , seems the obvious choice from inside the sport to replace departing @entity139 chief executive @entity138			0
but it seems that @entity139 chairman @entity141 wants to make an appointment from outside golf			0
the appointment of @entity145 , head of retail at @entity147 , as the new chief executive of the @entity149 was kept under wraps because , it is understood , the struggling betting giants were concerned how the departure would affect their share price			0
@entity145 ’s former racing roles include being director of business for trainer @entity157 , with whom he has four horses			0
@entity157 ’s racing concern went into voluntary liquidation in 2010 , but the @entity149 say @entity145 was a director of the company from 2005 to 2007 .			0

@entity163 and @entity2 joked about the @entity6 pantomime
the pair were each handed a £ 16,400 watch by @entity0 , but were ordered to return them
@entity2 returned his , but @entity4 plans to send his to auction
@entity73 has not spoken to @entity77 since *joining* @entity75
