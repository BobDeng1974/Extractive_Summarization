by @entity0 drivers in the @entity2 are being short changed when it comes to motoring , with the country being named as the most expensive place on earth to run a car			2
soaring costs of fuel , insurance , road tax and repair bills mean that it now costs @entity2 drivers £ 3,453 every year to run their vehicles			1
the cost of running an average family car in the @entity2 costs £ 1,000 more than in the @entity19 and @entity20 , £ 1,825 than @entity21 and a staggering £ 2,000 more than in @entity22			1
cost of motoring : comparing the cost of fuel , insurance , road tax and @entity29 , on average it costs the @entity2 drivers £ 3,453 a year to run their vehicles , which is £ 1,000 more than in the @entity19 and @entity20 the survey , carried out by @entity32 , compared the cost of motoring , including the price of fuel , insurance , road tax and @entity29 in 21 countries on five continents			1
and the study and revealed that on many fronts the @entity2 motorist is paying more than anyone else , with only those in the @entity44 and @entity45 coming close			0
@entity44 drivers pay out £ 3,370.42 , the @entity45 £ 3,321.80 , although in @entity22 this figure is just £ 1,315.12 and in @entity48 just £ 237.22			1
while many drivers regularly complain about the cost of re-filling their cars at the fuel pumps , it would appear they have some justification , with the bulk of the cost of running a car stemming from petrol or diesel			2
based on an annual mileage of 12,500 , the average @entity2 driver will spend £ 2,256 a year on fuel			1
it means we shell out an average of 27p for every mile			0
however , just across the channel in @entity67 it would cost £ 2,078			0
comparison : how do drivers in the @entity2 fare when it comes to the cost of running a car ? and it is little wonder that the great @entity19 road trip conjures up such warm feelings when you consider the cost of fuel for a year in the @entity80 is a measly £ 990 , which works out at around 8p a mile			1
in oil - rich @entity48 , where fuel can cost as little as 7p per litre , a year of filling up the tank could cost as little as £ 129			0
@entity2 drivers are also being hit hard when it comes to road tax , with the survey calculating that the average cost in this country is £ 225 a year			2
this is seven times the amount paid by drivers in @entity45 , @entity92 and @entity93 , while those in @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 do not have to fork out for road tax at all			0
there is some good news for @entity2 drivers however ; recent falls in the cost of car insurance mean that the @entity2 average premium of £ 667 is on a par with countries such as the @entity19 and @entity94 plus @entity107 nations like @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity44			1
that also puts @entity2 drivers well ahead of @entity45 where the average premium is a massive £ 1,200 , although more than @entity67 , @entity92 and @entity20 where drivers pay less than £ 400 a year			1
in @entity20 the average cost of insurance £ 383 , in @entity92 , £ 350 , while in @entity67 the average is just £ 286			0
other expenses include maintenance and repairs , the cost of which has crept up as many modern cars are too complicated for @entity124 mechanics to fix on their own			0
road to ruin : these drivers on the @entity127 will pay an average of £ 2,256 per year for fuel , which works out at around 27p per mile expense : with petrol prices rising it is no surprise that the bulk of the cost of running a car comes from fuel @entity136 , head of technical services for @entity138 , said : ' most of us do n’t stop to think how much each journey in the car actually costs and as the price of fuel , insurance , road tax and mots have all crept up in recent years , the total is now a massive outlay for the average household			1
' the new figures have prompted calls for chancellor @entity149 to cut the cost of fuel duty in next month 's @entity152			0
the @entity154 campaign co-founder @entity153 said many drivers end up spending an incredible 15 per cent of their income on fuel , with the @entity158 taking 60per cent of what drivers put into their tax on duty and vat			0
' in a recent @entity154 poll of 25,000 supporters , more than 87 per cent said that their cost of living is worse when compared to 12 months ago because of the high cost of petrol and diesel , ' he told the @entity170			0
where your money goes : the cost of running a car for @entity2 motorists rising prices : @entity2 drivers spend £ 2,356 a year on fuel @entity2 @entity179 spend £ 2,256 a year on fuel - an average of 27p for every mile			1
here 's how it compares to the cost in other countries			0

@entity45 £ 1,200 @entity19 £ 900 @entity20 £ 383 @entity92 £ 350 @entity67 £ 286 .			2
