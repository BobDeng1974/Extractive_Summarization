the @entity18 microwave pressure cooker ( pictured above ) combines the convenience of microwave cooking with the speed and nutrient - retaining efficiency of pressure cooking without the need for pans or the stove any normal pan on the hob will cook at no more than boiling point of @entity31 , however pressure cookers lock in the steam which means the cooking temperature is even higher			1
the traditional pressure cooker is a heavy metal contraption with locking lid that sits on top of the cooker hob , locking in the steam or cooking sauces in order to generate high temperatures			1
if using a microwave or a pressure cooker is too basic for you , then a new kitchen ' robot ' could allow you to produce some more ambitious dishes			2

however , the new version is similar in design , other than it is made from sturdy plastic , which means that it can go in the microwave oven to turn up the speed another notch			1
for example , while it takes 30 minutes to cook a chilli con carne in the standard metal version it is possible to cut this to around 20 in the microwave safe version – just because the ingredients heat up more quickly			1
it could take as long as one and three - quarter hours to make a steamed sponge pudding in a normal pan on the hob			1
this can be cut to around 50 minutes in a conventional pressure cooker and little as five in the new gadget			1

a recipe book with the gadget suggests frozen peas can be cooked in 2 - 3 minutes ; cauliflower florets in 3 - 4 and new potatoes in 5 - 6			0
all these timings are based on using a relatively low power 700 watt microwave			0
@entity18 said the concept has been popular in @entity164 and the firm has now brought it to the @entity166 for the first time			2
