it looked like a rare act of kindness in the midst of mindless violence			0
dazed and bleeding , a young man sitting on the ground had been beaten senseless during a violent street attack in @entity9			2
surrounded by a small crowd of curious onlookers , a ‘ @entity14 ’ gently helps the vulnerable and frightened young man to his feet			1
but within seconds looters decided this was a target too good to ignore			2
@entity18 to see the disturbing video dazed and confused , blood dripping from his mouth , a young man is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in @entity26 from nowhere , an apparent @entity14 walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement a sickening @entity32 video then captures one of the most callous moments in three days of violent disorder			1
a passer - by – spotting the opportunity – circles round behind the confused man and breaks into his rucksack			1
he unzips it , searching for something to steal , and within seconds the heartless thief is joined by a handful of other thugs swarming around the man ’s rucksack			2
even the apparently kind - hearted individual who initially helps the man unsteadily to his feet appears to burrow into the bag			2
lowest of the low : the teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack lawless : one of the yobs shamelessly rifles through the teenager 's bag as he stands , dazed from his injury daylight robbery : the boy becomes aware of what is happening as the gang closes in around him it is only then , too late , that the young man realises what is going on behind his back			1
until then he had continued attending to the blood still dripping from his head and mouth			0
he weakly swats a hand at one of the robbers , but it has little effect			0
for the first thug , dressed in a baseball cap , windcheater and blue jeans , pulls something out of the rucksack , contemptuously discards the plastic wrapping and then struts off with his loot			0
helping themselves : the thieves examine their loot as the teenager tries to get away discarded : the robber , having taken the items from the teenager 's bag , then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away aftermath : the boy is caught on camera moments later , standing confused and alone at the side of the street an appalled narrator to the film , which was posted on @entity32 , says : ‘ are they actually helping him up ? @entity106			1
are they going through his bag ? ‘ he just took something from his bag			0
