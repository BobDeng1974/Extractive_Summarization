by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 19 september 2012 six years after entering the @entity2 as the third player taken in the draft , @entity1 finds himself without a team and with just a fraction of the money he received from a contract that guaranteed him $ 26million			1
the question is , where did it all go ? in an increasingly caustic war of words , attorneys have been arguing for months over whether @entity1 is an out - of - control spender who put himself deeply in the hole or simply a victim of inexperienced advisers , one of whom was his own uncle			1
fall from grace : after entering the @entity2 in 2006 as a top draft pick , @entity1 finds himself without a team and with only a fraction of the money he received from a $ 26million contract either way , the quarterback whose future seemed unlimited after he led @entity28 to a @entity30 victory in 2006 is now back home in @entity33 and in a tenuous financial condition			1
' i would just say that @entity1 needs a job , ' said @entity37 , @entity1 's attorney , when asked to give a general assessment of his client 's finances			2
@entity1 was cut by the @entity41 , his third @entity2 team , in august			1
he was trying to make the @entity41 as a backup , the same role he filled with the @entity45 in 2011			2
the fall has been a dizzying one for the player who twice made the @entity48 with the @entity49			0
standout : @entity1 was the third pick in the @entity51 , when he latched on with the @entity49 out of cash : @entity1 is broke , despite a contract that guaranteed him $ 26million @entity1 sent out a tweet thanking the @entity41 and their fans after he was released but has n't spoken to the media since			1
he declined a request to be interviewed for this story			0
even in pro sports , where tales of squandered wealth abound , @entity1 's plight is ' pretty dramatic , ' said @entity63 , a professor at the @entity65 's @entity64 who has written and lectured extensively on the business of sports			2
' you 'd think it would be hard to blow that much money , ' @entity63 said			0
@entity1 is suing his former agent , @entity73 , and a @entity75 financial planner , @entity74 , alleging that they misappropriated $ 5.5million			1
cut : @entity1 was trying out for a back - up quarterback job with the @entity41 , but he was released in august in some instances , the pair forged his signature or impersonated him on the phone or in emails , according to the lawsuit , filed in @entity33 in june			1
the suit was filed five days after a @entity86 lender notified @entity1 that a loan of nearly $ 1.9million obtained in his name during the @entity2 lockout in 2011 was in default			1
@entity1 is now seeking to stop the lender , @entity91 , from enforcing a judgment of nearly $ 1.7million , claiming he was n't involved in obtaining the loan and that the proceeds went to @entity73 and @entity95			1
' they conspired to take @entity1 's money , ' @entity37 said			2
' it 's that simple			0
' @entity1 was the first client of a company , ( hash ) 1 @entity101 , formed by @entity73 , a @entity33 criminal defense attorney , and the quarterback 's uncle , @entity102 , a former middle school teacher			2
@entity1 's problem was ' he was just very young ... and allowing these people to have too much control over his life and his name , ' @entity37 said			2
that notion is vigorously disputed by attorneys for @entity73 and @entity74 , who say @entity1 has nobody to blame but himself			2
' this is a person scrambling helplessly and pointing in all directions to blame others to get out of debt , ' said @entity116 , @entity73 ' attorney			0
@entity73 twice wrote checks to himself from @entity1 's accounts , but both times were out of necessity , including once when the agent was required to use personal funds to charter a plane for the quarterback after he missed a team flight , @entity116 said			1
@entity95 has filed a countersuit in which he castigates @entity102 for allowing his uncle to serve as his business manager despite having no expertise in that field			0
peoples claims in the countersuit that every decision he made was approved by @entity102			0
disappointment : it is not known whether @entity1 lost his funding with frivolous spending , or whether he fell victim to inexperienced advisers - one of whom was his own uncle and he calls @entity1 's unwillingness to accept responsibility ' a common occurrence ... as ( former @entity49 coach ) @entity151 , ( @entity28 coach ) @entity152 , numerous @entity2 executives , coaches , teammates , scouts , girlfriends and illegitimate children will attest			2
' peoples ' attorney , @entity153 , said he has documents to support the strongly - worded filing			0
' you 'll find there was a lot of money being spent in a bunch of different directions , ' @entity153 said			0
a working phone number for @entity102 could not be located			0
court records do not show that he has an attorney			0
according to public records , @entity1 was one of at least 10 @entity2 players who turned to @entity91 for cash during the lockout			0
second - in - command : @entity1 served as a back - up quarterback to @entity172 in the 2011 season with the @entity45 loan documents show he borrowed the $ 1.9million at 20 per cent interest , with $ 619,122 in interest paid up front , and agreed that a judgment could be entered if he missed a payment			1
@entity1 authorized $ 1million in payments to @entity91 directly from his @entity45 salary during the 2011 season , and his accountant was working this year to have a similar arrangement with the @entity41 , according to court records			1
however , when a payment due in may was never made , the loan went into default			0
in challenging the loan 's validity , @entity1 claims he did n't ' knowingly execute ' any of the loan documents			0
anything he signed was ' without the corresponding documents attached and without knowledge as to what the signatures pages referred , ' one of his court filings states			0
@entity91 says its case is supported by the fact that @entity1 's signatures were notarized and that emails show he was involved in making sure the lender received repayment directly from the @entity45			0
' call me if this is not 100 per cent clear , ' @entity1 's accountant wrote him in august 2011 in an email explaining the arrangement			1
' we want to make certain you know exactly what is going on at all times , especially when you 're signing your name to something			0
' @entity1 also contends that @entity91 's efforts to serve him and the @entity41 with legal papers during training camp , which included a threat to contact the local sheriff , ' played a role ' in the @entity41 ' decision to release him			1
' i was n't in the room when they [ the @entity41 ] made a decision , but what would you think ? it certainly would n't help me if i 'm the owner or the head coach knowing all this is going on with @entity1 and then he goes out and plays poorly , ' @entity37 said			1
@entity41 coach @entity231 declined comment when asked if @entity1 's off - the - field issues had anything to do with his release .			1
