as dream starts go they did n't come any more perfect than @entity1 's			1
it was february , the season was just beginning , and on the @entity6 island of @entity7 the 21 - year - old @entity4 sprinted in at the head of a star - studded field to win the @entity10			2
next day , @entity1 did it again			1
two outings in the colours of his new team , @entity16 , and two victories			1
and among those watching from the sidelines , and kicking himself , was @entity21			1
@entity22 celebrates victory in @entity7 as he crosses the finish line for @entity16 @entity21 watched @entity25 win his first two races in @entity7 for @entity16 but @entity1 has since failed to hit the heights of sir @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) @entity1 pictured in action in @entity31 for @entity32 in the men 's under 23 time trial in 2009 @entity21 wondered whether , by not signing @entity1 for @entity35 , he had made a mistake that would come back to haunt him			1
because on that february day in @entity38 it really did seem that @entity1 might be the latest world beater to come off the @entity41 production line , after @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity42			1
that was 2011 and since then @entity1 's career has faltered			1
which is why he is grateful to finally get his chance with @entity35 , becoming the first scot to sign with the @entity41 team in a bid to reboot his career and prove those wins in @entity7 were no fluke			1
it 's a move @entity1 has been trying to engineer for almost a year			1
as he explains : ' i said to myself at the start of last season that if i do n't break into the classics team at @entity16 then i want to go somewhere i can at least ride those races			1
' i was pushing to move to @entity35 from early on in the season , so it 's a nice feeling to be there now			1
i know some of the people from @entity63 , but not all of them			0
so it 's a new environment for me			2
' at 24 , @entity1 is still young , but he admits 2014 was frustrating			1
his year could be summed up by a damp and cold @entity68 road race , where he represented @entity69 – although he was born in @entity70 and brought up in the @entity71 , his mother and her family are all from @entity72			0
in conditions that forced flights to be diverted from @entity75 , @entity1 cut a bedraggled figure as he abandoned the race long before @entity42 appeared on the finishing straight , arms aloft in victory			1
' i had a really bad day , ' @entity1 says now			1
' @entity1 had a terrible time at the @entity68 road race in @entity72 , which @entity42 won @entity1 ( centre ) could not replicate the podium success enjoyed in @entity7 during the @entity68 it was certainly a long way from @entity7 in february , 2011			1
yet when @entity1 joined @entity16 , the @entity88 super-squad , it seemed the perfect union			1
he is a big , powerful rider , with the potential to be a star of one - day classics such as the @entity93 and @entity94 – races dominated by his then new team			2
but the all - round strength of the squad – with riders such as @entity100 , as well as @entity29 and the new world champion , @entity102 – made it hard for a young , @entity41 rider to break through – particularly one as quiet as the unassuming @entity1			1
' i always knew it was going to be difficult because they 've got such a strong group of classics riders , ' says @entity1 from his home in @entity111 , @entity112			2
' you have to really show something special , and if you make one mistake , you 're off the list			0
' i got my chance at [ the semi-classic ] @entity119 last year and i was n't great there			0
and that was pretty much it , chance over			0
' @entity1 's frustration has been compounded by watching the progress of others : riders such as @entity128 , who @entity1 beat into second when he won the junior edition of the fabled @entity131 in 2008			1
@entity128 is now one of the sport 's superstars , recently signing a € 4 million deal with @entity135			2
it 's fair to say that @entity1 has signed for considerably less at @entity35			1
but the @entity41 team is one at which he should finally get his opportunity to ride @entity94 – famous for its cobbles , and known as the @entity141 – which he is yet to even start as a senior			0
@entity1 struggled to assert himself in the omega team but has now signed a deal with @entity35 in fact , in some respects @entity1 and his new team are in the same boat : both have much to prove – and improve upon – in the classics			1
in five years , while @entity152 's team has won the @entity153 twice , they have consistently failed in the major one - day events			1
now they have lost their leader in these races , the @entity159 @entity158 , it opens the door for a talented crop of @entity41 riders – @entity42 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and perhaps @entity1 , too			2
@entity1 has just returned from @entity7 and his first @entity35 training camp			1
' it was really good , super well organised , ' he says			0
' communication is massive and there 's a really personal focus			0
each rider is supported individually			0
' we watched videos and talked			0
@entity21 [ @entity175 ] likes to make a speech – i 've realised that			2
they do like to analyse things in depth , which is an approach that suits me			0
' i also sat down with @entity21 and @entity183 [ @entity184 ] , who is now my coach			2
i was in the @entity185 as a junior but never had much to do with either of them			0
they said : ' it 's like we know you , but we do n't , really			0
' so they 're trying to understand me , and how i like to work			0
' @entity1 is feeling positive after partaking in his first training camp with @entity35 in @entity7 @entity184 is the coach who started the academy , and who is credited with launching the careers of @entity29 and @entity42 , as well as masterminding @entity29 's world road race title in 2011			1
he admits that he does n't really know why @entity1 's career stalled – but he 's confident he can jump - start it			1
' he made such a great start , and he was given some opportunities , but for whatever reason he did n't piece them together , ' says @entity184			0
' his dreams are in the classics but he was riding for the world 's best classics team			2
it 's like a young guy trying to get in our @entity93 team – it 's very difficult			2
you 've got to be better than pretty good			0
' but i 've known @entity1 since he was 13 , i 've seen him come through as a schoolboy , and as a junior on the track and road , with great results			2
the talent is there , it 's bubbling under : he just does n't know how to get it out			0
' i 've been quite firm with him			0
i said , ' potential is all well and good , but you 're 24 now – you 've got to show what you can do			0
' @entity184 visited @entity1 in october and told him , ' this is how i work , this is what i expect			2
' he asked him to write a list of his goals , plans and ideas			0
' i ' m not a big writer , ' said @entity1			2
' neither am i , ' said @entity184 , ' but this is your job			0
' @entity1 praised the impact and influence of coach @entity184 ( left ) , pictured speaking to @entity42 @entity184 believes that @entity1 has lost confidence but says he will get a chance to prove his ability with @entity35 ' within three or four days i got an email , ' says @entity184			1
' he 'd written quite a lot of stuff			0
' @entity184 , who feels @entity1 has lost confidence , was encouraged by that			1
' last night i got another update , ' @entity184 adds			0
of one thing , @entity184 is sure : ' he will get his chance in this team			0
' and that 's all @entity1 can ask for			1
' it does feel a bit like coming home , ' he says			0
' it 's definitely easier for me to fit in , though there are so many staff – more than any other team , so there are a lot of names to remember			2
' but it 's a clean slate			0
if you 've made mistakes , you can move on			0
it does feel a bit like starting my career again			0

@entity1 's two debut wins for @entity16 were in front of @entity21 in 2011
he appeared to be set to follow in the *footsteps* of @entity29
but @entity1 failed to kick - on from there and could not break into the team
after signing for @entity35 , he wants to *rediscover* form and confidence
