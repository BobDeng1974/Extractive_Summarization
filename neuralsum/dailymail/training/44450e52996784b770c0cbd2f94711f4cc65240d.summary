@entity0 , nine , has one wish this @entity2 - she just wants to get better with @entity5 fast approaching , children across the world are eagerly waiting to see if @entity6 received their wish lists			1
from their favourite @entity10 character , to a scooter or a bike , bright parcels adorn the bottom of @entity2 trees waiting to be ripped open on the big morning			1
but for one nine - year - old from north @entity17 , her @entity2 wish is simple			1
@entity0 has written asking @entity2 to make her better			1
she was diagnosed with the life - limiting condition cystic fibrosis when she was just five weeks old			1
now she and her family face the agonising reality that half of sufferers do n't live past their young years			2
her mother @entity25 , 36 , told @entity26 : ' within 24 hours of @entity0 being born we knew something was wrong			1
' she failed to pass meconium as all newborns should , so she was immediately referred for tests			2
' she was eventually diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at five weeks old			1
‘ as a family , we knew nothing about @entity35			2
after her diagnosis , we discovered that both @entity0 's dad and i are carriers of the gene			1
' thankfully , our younger children @entity41 , five , @entity42 , three , do n't have the condition			1
' now @entity0 has written a letter to @entity6 , outlining her wish for @entity2 this year - to be well , like her brother and sister ... @entity49 , ' my name is @entity0 and i ’m nine years old			1
i live in @entity17 with my mum and dad and my younger brother and sister			1
' i do lots of sports and i really love netball			2
i ’ve got a new netball post in my garden , and i enjoy playing with it			2
' lots of children ask you for toys			2
but , this @entity2 , i wanted to write to you about something else			1
' i ’m different from other children			2
that ’s because i have cystic fibrosis ( @entity35 )			1
' i ’m so lucky to have so many toys and lovely things , but being healthier , coughing less and not having to take so many medicines would mean so much more to me this @entity2			1
the nine - year - old , from north @entity17 , was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was five weeks old instead of asking for toys this @entity2 , @entity0 has written to @entity6 asking that he make her well cystic fibrosis is a life - limiting genetic condition			1
only half of those diagnosed with the illness live to celebrate their 40th birthday			1
it causes the internal organs , especially the lungs and digestive system , to become clogged with thick sticky mucus , resulting in chronic infections and inflammation of the lungs			2
cystic fibrosis directly affects around 10,000 people in the @entity93			1
the faulty gene is carried by over two million people in the @entity93 , most of whom have no idea			2
if two carriers have children , there ’s a one in four chance their child will have the condition , which slowly destroys the lungs and digestive system			1
people with cystic fibrosis often look perfectly healthy			1
but it poses a lifelong challenge involving daily intake of drugs , time - consuming physiotherapy and isolation from others with the condition			1
it places a huge burden on those around them and the condition can critically escalate at any moment			1
@entity0 and her family have been supported by the @entity124 , which is in its 50th year			1
the charity aims to fundraise for better treatments and investment into cutting edge research so that people with cystic fibrosis can also look forward to their fiftieth birthdays			1

‘ recently , i found out that i can die from having @entity35 ' it made me feel so scared			2
if i could have anything this @entity2 ? i ’d like to be well			1
' life for me is a bit like a rollercoaster – my health is up and down			2
' there are so many simple things that i ’d like to do that i ca n’t			2
‘ i ’m not allowed to go into public indoor swimming pools			0
' when i was five years old and my school friends started swimming lessons , i was n’t allowed to join in			0
' i ’ve never swum with my friends in a public swimming pool or played in the water at school because of the infections that i could catch , and that makes me sad			0
' i have to be careful around people who have coughs			0
if i get a cold it can damage my lungs			0
so if my friends or family are ill they ca n’t come to my house			0
it can be lonely sometimes			0
' at the end of last term , when i was eight , i was getting more and more worried about not being able to do things			0
' i was worried that i ’d never be able to go to sleepovers and parties at my friends ’ houses because i ’d have to do physiotherapy instead			0
' i was scared what people would think about me having to take lots of pills and not being able to join in all the activities			0
i felt like i was different			0
' my feelings were all mixed up			0
i felt angry and sad			0
' mum and dad even bought me a punch bag to take my frustrations out on			0
' i also started going to a talking doctor who helped me understand my feelings and my anger			0
then , before the summer holidays , i decided that i wanted to tell more people at school about @entity35 she said : ' recently , i found out that many @entity35 sufferers do n’t make it past their 40th birthdays			0
it made me feel so scared			0
if i could have anything this @entity2 ? i ’d like to be well ' cystic fibrosis affects every part of @entity0 's life , she tells @entity6 she ca n't go swimming with her friends and has to be careful to avoid anyone with a cough			1
she just wants to be like her little brother @entity42 , three , and sister @entity41 , five , pictured left @entity0 's mother , @entity25 said her daughter faces strict treatment regimes that often result in her being admitted to hospital ' i wanted to do this because it was stressing me out that they did n’t know anything about my condition			1
' my mum and dad had spoken to my teachers , but my class and other pupils did n’t really know about @entity35 ' so one day , my class were all sitting together and i told them what @entity35 is and how it makes me feel			0
' i told them that i got @entity35 because my dad has a @entity35 gene and my mum also has a @entity35 gene , but they did n’t both know this before i was born ; when their genes made me , it gave me @entity35 ' i told them that you ca n’t catch @entity35 ; it ’s something that i was born with			2
' afterwards one of my friends kept trying to help me walk , and i know she was just being nice , but i told her to stop			0
' i told people not to treat me like i ’m disabled otherwise i ’d get upset			0
i want to try to be like everyone else			0
' now that my friends know it ’s a big relief			0
' they treat me like i ’m one of them , and i do n’t need to use the punch bag as much			0
i still get upset sometimes but i ’m coping better			0
what i ’d really like this @entity2 is to be able to meet someone else who has @entity35 – someone older who could tell me that everything was going to be ok			1
' but i ’m not allowed to meet others face - to - face because we could infect each other			2
' recently , my parents arranged for me to speak to a family friend who has @entity35 on @entity246			0
we tried to talk , but i felt awkward and upset and scared			0
though @entity0 's parents both carry the @entity35 gene they only passed it to their eldest child ' all i wanted to do was meet her in person but i can never do that			1
it ’s horrible that we ca n’t meet			0
‘ i do physiotherapy twice a day , have lots of nebulisers and inhaled medicine and swallow at least 50 pills every day			0
' i have to go to the doctors a lot			0
when i get really poorly with a bad chest , i have tubes in my arms - intravenous antibiotics			2
' i get nightmares near my birthday because that ’s when i have my yearly check up – blood tests which scare me because i hate needles			0
' i ’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when i grow up i want to be a vet or an actress			0
since i ’ve told my friends about my cf i want more people to know more too so that they can understand too			0
' and , despite everything , i still manage to have fun			0
@entity5 @entity279 , @entity0 @entity280 as @entity0 's letter reveals , her condition affects every part of her life			1
' she has strict treatment regimens and medical routines that are lengthy and tiring , ' saidher mother			1
' when very poorly , she is put on intravenous medication for two weeks and potentially needs a bronchoscopy , which is an exploratory lung procedure			2
’ as @entity0 has grown older and has become aware of her condition , her parents have had to address some difficult issues			1
many sufferers require life - saving heart and lung transplants if their condition deteriorates			1
' we ’ve used diagrams to explain the genetics to @entity0 and she now understands the medical background to her condition , ' said mrs @entity0			1
' we talk to her about the progress that is being made with medical trials , and the hopes for medical and scientific advancements			0
' but she worries about the future and about the daily management of her condition , along with the embarrassment of explaining it to people			2
' @entity0 added : ' i ’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when i grow up i want to be a vet or an actress			1
since i ’ve told my friends about my cf i want more people to know more too so that they can understand too			0
and , despite everything , i still manage to have fun '			0

@entity0 was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis *shortly* after she was born
every moment of the nine - year - old 's life is affected by the condition
she has strict treatment regimes and faces heart and lung transplants
all @entity0 wants for @entity2 is to be well like her brother and sister
