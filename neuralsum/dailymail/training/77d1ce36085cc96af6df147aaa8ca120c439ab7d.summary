@entity0 tried her best on monday to walk back her controversial economic body - slam from a speech on friday , explaining away her claim that it 's not ' corporations and businesses that create jobs			1
' the talking point three days later : ' so - called trickle - down economics has failed			2
i short - handed this point the other day , so let me be absolutely clear about what i 've been saying for a couple of decades			0
” “ our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good - paying jobs here in @entity18 and workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out – not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas			1
' but the damage has been done			0
conservatives have a new rally cry – ' do n’t let anybody tell you that it ’s , you know , corporations and businesses that create jobs , ' she said – and campaign consultants will have a new advertisement drawn up if @entity38 runs for president in 2016			1
i short - handed this point the other day ' comics and conservatives lit up @entity56 after @entity0 's jobs gaffe -- and did n't let up when she tried to walk it back @entity61 @entity60 bureau chief @entity59 quickly pointed out friday , somewhat tongue - in - cheek , that clinton - haters looking for a source to refute her claims about job creation need look ho further than her own memoir , ' @entity69			1
' in the book , she writes of @entity18 companies ' slowly gaining access to @entity75 markets , creating jobs and opportunities for people in both countries			0
' later she recalls how a @entity18 @entity81 junket was organized ' because more trade between @entity18 and @entity83 promised to create jobs and opportunities in both countries			2
' but there she was in @entity87 , appearing alongside stalwart liberal women – gubernatorial hopeful @entity43 and senator @entity90 – and seemingly trying to maneuver herself into a position more populist than either one			0
@entity92 is a presidential hopeful long pined - for by progressive hardliners who think @entity38 is too close to the @entity95 establishment to be much of a change - maker			1
another possible explanation for @entity38 's friday gaffe is that she may have omitted words from her prepared speech , as her aides insisted to reporters at the @entity44 rally			1
an indictment of ' tax breaks for ' corporations and businesses , and a claim that they do n't aid job creation , would hardly have registered a blip on anyone 's campaign radar			2
but delivered as it was , ' do n’t let anybody tell you that it ’s corporations and businesses that create jobs ' brought critics out of the woodwork on @entity56			1
' huh ? ' comedian @entity122 tweeted			0
' that 's not trickle down , that 's who hires people			2
' ' every job i 've gotten is from a business & corporation , ' he added			0
' and when the corporation goes out of business , people lose their jobs ! common cents ! ' and monday 's walk - back notwithstanding , @entity136 immediately pointed to @entity38 's seeming dismissal of job - creators as a retread of one of president @entity143 's most loathed talking points			1
during a july 13 , 2012 speech in @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity143 offended free - marketeers and small businessmen and women by suggesting that the government had more to do with their successes than they did themselves			1
welcome to campaign 2016 : @entity38 's explanation for her ill - timed line on job creation did n't sit well with many -- especially partisans who were n't in her corner to begin with everybody 's a comedian : @entity38 will earn no end of scorn from what the @entity136 will regard as her ' you did n't build that ' moment ' if you were successful ... somebody helped to create this unbelievable @entity18 system that we have that allowed you to thrive , ' he said			1
' somebody invested in roads and bridges			0
' ' if you 've got a business – you did n't build that			2
somebody else made that happen			0
' he said later in the speech that successful entrepreneurs ' did n't get there on your own			0
i 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because i was just so smart			0
' the so - called ' trickle - down ' economic theory , itself a shorthand for a broader set of ideas , is generally understood to refer to policies that put capital in the hands of business instead of government , with the expectation that the money will create jobs and other economic activity			1
conservative politicians generally express their approval of the idea by green - lighting tax breaks and other benefits to corporations and high - income earners			0
@entity207 pols typically criticize the theory by insisting that tax breaks and other government benefits go directly to lower - income @entity18 , including many who do n't pay taxes .			0

@entity38 sent *pundits* into a tizzy on friday in @entity44 with a *ham* - *fisted* *attack* on ' trickle down economics '
the *presumptive* @entity95 presidential *favorite* said : ' do n't let anybody tell you that , you know , it ’s corporations and businesses that create jobs '
on monday she offered a tepid *backpedal* without acknowledging her gaffe
the *remark* has @entity60 *insiders* *fretting* that it 's @entity38 's ' you did n't build that ' moment , referring to a 2012 @entity143 speech line that went sour
