by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:24 est , 2 february 2013 @entity3 : 03:19 est , 4 february 2013 centre stage : @entity5 performed both the @entity6 and @entity8 national anthems before the @entity10 game at @entity11 yesterday with her nerve - racking appearance singing to 81,000 @entity10 fans out of the way , you might imagine soprano @entity5 would have had enough of rugby for one weekend			1
but today she will be back on the pitch – only this time the elegant thigh - slit dress and heels will be ditched for boots and a mud - spattered kit			1
and the crowd ? about 50 , weather permitting			0
for not only is the 22 - year - old the national anthem singer for the @entity28 side , she also plays full - back for @entity30 - the aptly named ‘ @entity31 ’ - in @entity32			1
and @entity5 admits that whether she ’s singing at @entity11 or running out at @entity34 , the butterflies still kick in			1
‘ i get nervous for both , believe it or not			0
’ it probably wo n’t be a capacity crowd for the @entity34 ladies match against @entity40 today – and a water - logged pitch was threatening to scrap the fixture , but @entity5 has got the rugger bug			1
‘ i ’m used to standing in a concert hall on my own , but playing rugby gives me the opportunity to be part of a team so we can celebrate together or support each other if we lose ! ’ she told the @entity53			0
@entity5 , who has twice sung at @entity54 and performed for the @entity55 said she does not let fear of being hurt on the field curb her love of the game			1
‘ i ’m not the kind of person to live life carefully , ’ she said			0
‘ it is full - on contact rugby i play			0
’ ‘ it ’s a different feeling stepping out onto a pitch in a glamorous dress and heels compared to boots and gumshield , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ from playing rugby , i definitely found even more respect for professional sportsmen and how focused dedicate you must be			0
’ @entity5 added : ‘ i ’m all about live performances , for me it is live or not at all			2
as a fan , i ’d feel cheated if someone mimed in a stadium			0
pitch perfect : but the soprano will today turn out for her local rugby side @entity30 in @entity32 , potentially watched by a mere 50 spectators ‘ at @entity11 , it is incredibly hard to hear yourself , there is a lot of background noise , but a real buzz to peform			1
‘ i see my role as an opportunity to build interest in the women ’s game			0
’ her appointment as the official anthem ‘ voice ’ last year came as something of a shock for her main rival @entity101 , who also happens to be the girlfriend of @entity28 xv captain @entity104			0
miss @entity101 , 24 , was born in @entity32 but has a @entity106 mother and a @entity108 father			2
she has sung at four @entity28 games at @entity11 as well as royal charity concerts			2
but when asked on @entity111 whether she would be singing yesterday , @entity101 said : ‘ i ’ll be in the stands cheering for my man ! ’ swapped : @entity101 , 24 , pictured right , who is the girlfriend of @entity28 captain @entity104 , found herself replaced by 22 - year - old singing rugby player @entity5 , left @entity5 trains twice a week for @entity34 , and manager @entity115 said that in her first season she had impressed her team - mates			1
‘ she ’s got speed and good technical awareness , ’ said miss @entity115			0
‘ we generally get between 50 and 60 people watching our matches , so it ’s not quite @entity11 , but the passion is there just the same			2
’ @entity5 will create history when she sings for @entity28 ladies on february 23rd when they play their international against @entity129 on the same pitch and same day as the men , a first for the championship .			2

@entity5 performed national anthems at @entity11 yesterday
she will turn out for local side @entity30 in @entity32 today
the 22 - year - old says she gets butterflies before both events
