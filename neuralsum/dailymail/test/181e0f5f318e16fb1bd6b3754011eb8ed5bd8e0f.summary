' thanks @entity53 for doing awesome work on me			0
looks just like my son , ' he wrote			0
but @entity8 soon found himself being berated by his friend @entity58 who asked if the picture was a joke			1
after @entity8 confirmed that it was n't , @entity58 expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo , noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future			1
' why on your f * * * * * * face ? ! how are you ever going to get a real f * * * * * job to support your son with a tattoo on your face ? ' she asked			1

' @entity8 went on to call it a ' beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face '			1
meanwhile , another friend , @entity104 , predicted that regret would eventually set in			0
' i give it [ three ] years before the regret starts [ rolling ] in , ' he said , before noting : i 'm not judging [ though ]			0
i think it 's great work			0
but society frowns upon face tattoos			0
' @entity8 responded by saying : ' well my son looked at it [ and ] smiled so that 's all i care about			1
