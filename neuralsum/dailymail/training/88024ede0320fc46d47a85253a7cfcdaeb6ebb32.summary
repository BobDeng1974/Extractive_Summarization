by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:24 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 01:36 est , 3 july 2012 bankers will have to give evidence on oath to a six - month parliamentary inquiry into their behaviour			1
@entity7 and @entity8 dismissed calls for a judge - led investigation , like that into the media by @entity14 , insisting a panel of senior mps and peers could act more quickly and forensically			2
the committee will aim to report by @entity19 so its recommendations can be included in a @entity21 due early next year			1
but the government 's move drew scorn from @entity38 , which is to try to force a @entity40 vote as early as today on whether a public inquiry should be held instead			1
labour sources said they were considering whether or not to co-operate with the @entity44 investigation			2
if @entity38 refused to allow its mps and peers to sit on the panel , its cross-party credibility would be fatally undermined			0
the chancellor told @entity47 : ' the failure to regulate the banks in the boom years cost this country billions of pounds			0
the behaviour of some in the financial services industry has damaged the reputation of an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people and is vital to the economic prosperity of the country			0
' we are changing the failed regulation , reforming the banks – now it 's time to deal with the culture that flourished in the age of irresponsibility and hold those who allowed it to flourish to account			0
' i do n't think a long costly public inquiry is the right answer			1
it would take months to set up and years to report			1
we know what went wrong			0
we ca n't wait until 2015 or 2016 to fix it			0
anger : @entity80 called for a full independent inquiry into banking standards ' let us have a serious inquiry , but let us have an inquiry that comes to a conclusion within a measurably short period of time , so we can actually amend the law that is going before the @entity89 next year			1
' the committee , which is expected to start work as early as next week , is to be led by @entity92 , the chairman of the @entity93			1
senior figures from the @entity89 , such as former chancellor @entity95 , are expected to be invited to sit on the panel , as well as a number of cross-bench peers			0
unusually , the committee is expected to question people under oath , including members of both houses , and powers to summon witnesses or relevant papers			1
witnesses are likely to include @entity108 governor sir @entity107 and his deputy @entity109 , former prime minister @entity110 and shadow chancellor @entity111 , who was a @entity113 minister when the scandal was taking place			1
a separate , independent review of the regulation of @entity26 , the inter-bank lending rate at the centre of the scandal , will also take place and will be headed by @entity122 , the chief of the @entity123			1
his review will also look at the adequacy of the @entity127 's current civil and criminal sanctioning powers with regards to financial conduct and market abuse			0
mr @entity80 said the inquiry did not go far enough and demanded a ' full and open inquiry , independent of bankers and independent of politicians '			1
' however able or distinguished , politicians investigating bankers will not command the consent of the @entity127 people , ' he told @entity47			0
' people are understandably angry about the way banks let them down and i do n't believe the proposed way forward is a way we can build the consensus that is required for real change			2
' mr @entity111 said the decision to reject @entity38 's call for a judge - led public inquiry ' will not do '			1
' just as in phone hacking or the @entity160 war , so in banking , only with an independent , forensic and open public inquiry , not politicians investigating bankers , can we re-build trust for the future , ' he said			1
banking , he added , was a profession which depended on trust , and that trust was ' currently in tatters '			2
in the @entity89 , former @entity167 minister @entity166 condemned the ' monstrous ' activities of those behind the manipulation of interest rates and questioned the role of trade minister @entity173 , who was chairman of the @entity174 when it took place			0
the @entity93 has launched its own investigation into the rate fixing scandal , with @entity180 boss @entity179 due to give evidence tomorrow			0
committee sources said mr @entity109 is likely to be summoned as well as two former chancellors , @entity184 and mr @entity110			2
in another move , mr @entity8 confirmed taxpayers would scoop a windfall worth billions of pounds from fines which are expected to be paid by @entity127 banks involved in the manipulation of interest rates			0
at present , all fines which are levied by the @entity167 regulator , the @entity192 , benefit banks , rather than cash - strapped taxpayers			0
the money is paid to the @entity192 , which uses the cash to lower the annual levy paid by all its regulated members from banks to small building societies			0
but yesterday the chancellor said all fines – backdated from april this year to include the @entity180 fine – will be paid into the public purse .			2

committee to report by the end of the year so it can influence new banking *legislation* proposed for 2013
will have power to summon witnesses under oath
@entity80 renews call for longer , independent inquiry
