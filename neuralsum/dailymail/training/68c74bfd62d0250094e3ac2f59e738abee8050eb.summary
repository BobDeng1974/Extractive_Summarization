the @entity0 was forced into an embarrassing apology last night after broadcasting footage of @entity3 leering over a young woman on @entity5 , and apparently brushing her top			1
the astonishing gaffe went out on @entity8 on saturday september 13 at 10.45pm when viewers tuned in to watch @entity10 , a compilation programme of vintage hits from the 1970s and 80s			1
in the footage originally filmed in 1971 , @entity13 – now known as @entity15 ’s most notorious paedophile – is seen among a crowd of music fans who are dancing during a performance by @entity20			2
the woman ’s identity is unknown , but the @entity0 received complaints from viewers and the images were later removed from a repeat of the show available on the @entity0 ’s @entity35 service , with a note saying the content had been edited			1
last night , one of @entity3 ’s victims reacted to the blunder with anger and dismay			1
@entity43 , 54 , who was sexually abused by @entity3 when she was just 14 , told @entity44 : ‘ when are they going to learn ? they ’ve got no regard for anybody except themselves			1
does n’t anyone vet these programmes before they come out ? ‘ it ’s just not good enough			0
i want to know who ’s in charge			0
somebody must know what content is in the programme before it hits the screen			1
it just takes my breath away			0
these people have a total disregard for people ’s feelings			1
’ she added : ‘ i ’m utterly shocked and disgusted			0
this is an insult not only to @entity3 ’s victims , but also the general public			1
i think they should destroy all footage they ’ve got of him			2
why anyone would want to keep it for posterity , i ’ve no idea			0
the @entity0 is throwing mud at us , disregarding everything we ’ve done and how far we ’ve come in our fight			1
’ edited : the online @entity35 message @entity77 , an abuse lawyer at @entity78 , which is representing 174 of @entity3 ’s victims , added : ‘ you ca n’t underestimate the amount of distress @entity3 ’s victims will have suffered if they have seen this			2
' it is a constant reminder of what they have been through			0
many of them still await the findings of the @entity0 inquiry and a resolution to questions that have been ongoing for nearly two years			2
seeing something like this reawakens their suffering			0
’ and mp @entity96 said : ‘ having failed to deal with a series of paedophile @entity0 stars , it ’s astonishing it could put @entity3 on air again apparently touching a young woman			1
this will be very hurtful to his many victims and is particularly inept of @entity104			0
’ when contacted by @entity44 , the @entity104 apologised ‘ for any distress caused ’			0
the @entity0 confirmed it had received seven complaints about the footage , but this is not the first time it has allowed offensive footage of @entity13 to slip through editing			1
last year , it was forced to apologise after airing an impersonation of @entity13 on children ’s tv channel , @entity114			2
the @entity0 received more than 200 complaints after showing a 2001 episode of the @entity117 featuring a character sporting a blond wig and a gold necklace , who did a convincing impression of the disgraced star ’s @entity124 accent			2
@entity3 is now known to have abused hundreds of young victims over six decades			2
but the former @entity10 presenter , who received a knighthood in 1990 , died aged 84 in october 2011 – a year before the allegations emerged in an @entity132 documentary after the @entity0 shelved a @entity134 investigation into the star			1
@entity137 ’s failure to run the @entity134 story led to the £ 2.4million @entity139			0
a judge - led inquiry looking into sexual abuse at the @entity0 is due to report at the end of the year and the scandal prompted the @entity145 to set up @entity146 , which has encouraged hundreds of victims to come forward and report abuse by @entity3 and other celebrities			1
last night a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we have reviewed references to @entity3 across archive footage , including a number which were brought to our attention			1
where the material is likely to cause offence to his victims it is removed			0
although all programmes are reviewed before broadcast , unfortunately this brief appearance was missed			0
it was removed from @entity35 as soon as we were made aware and replaced with a re-edited version			0
we apologise for any distress caused			0
