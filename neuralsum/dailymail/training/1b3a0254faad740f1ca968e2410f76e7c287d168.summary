sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most ' appropriate ' way for the @entity4 to help them , mps warn			1
the number of recipient states in dire need is falling and sending handouts to rapidly growing economies such as @entity11 is no longer a ' sufficient response ' , they say			0
in a report published today , mps call for reform to @entity4 's overseas aid programme , saying taxpayers ' money would be better spent on ' co-operation '			1
sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most ' appropriate ' way for the @entity4 to help , according to @entity12 ( pictured relief goods are unloaded in @entity21 ) efforts should be diverted to ' beyond aid ' projects – using @entity4 expertise to encourage trade and helping to overhaul tax collection and public services such as health , schools and the justice systems			1
the document , compiled by a cross-party group of mps on the @entity36 international development committee , follows official figures that show the number of ' priority countries ' has fallen from 28 to 22			2
although the report endorses the much - criticised target to allocate 0.7 per cent of @entity4 's gdp to poor countries , it calls for a ' new approach '			1
@entity45 and @entity46 ( pictured ) , should be moving to ' beyond aid ' programmes within five years , according to @entity49 , a @entity50 mp on the committee it says : ' the nature of international development is changing ... aid remains essential for poor countries , and for some purposes in middle income countries			1
' however overall , a new approach is needed which reflects the changing situation			0
as grants of aid become less appropriate in some countries , so new forms of development co-operation are necessary			2
' the committee said aid remained vital for ' fragile ' countries fighting infectious diseases such as ebola or those embroiled in conflict or humanitarian crises			2
but it called for more focus on ' beyond aid ' policies that address the underlying causes of poverty , a ' modest ' investment in which has an impact ' much larger than can be brought about through aid '			0
such a move would benefit @entity4 households , who pay about £ 430 a year towards overseas aid to countries including @entity11 – which last year received £ 169million despite having its own space programme			1
@entity49 , a @entity50 mp on the committee , said aid recipients such as @entity45 and @entity46 , should be moving to ' beyond aid ' programmes within five years			0
he added : ' @entity87 must make sure that countries which no longer require our cash are instead benefiting from @entity4 expertise and helped to run their own public services			1
' committee chairman sir @entity93 said aid has a role to play in ' building new partnerships ' with emergent countries like @entity11 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
' however the number of poor countries is falling , and those that remain often suffer from conflict , so need multiple interventions ... that is why development in the future will not just be about aid , ' he said			2
the @entity87 backed the committee 's findings and said the government needs to ' find new ways of working with emerging powers '			0
a spokesman said it has already diverted funds away from traditional aid ' with the aim of ending aid dependency once and for all '			0
many @entity50 mps oppose the 0.7 per cent target and its link to gdp – national wealth – which led to an extra £ 1billion in aid added last year because of better than expected economic growth .			0
