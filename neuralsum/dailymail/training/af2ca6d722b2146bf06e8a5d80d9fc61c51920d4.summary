most men enjoy a good pint of lager or real ale while they are watching football or relaxing with friends			0
very few would dedicate themselves for more than two decades to the world 's longest pub crawl			2
but six friends from the @entity10 have embarked on a special quest to drink in a different pub every saturday night - and have done so for 28 years			2
@entity19 , 56 , his father @entity13 , 81 , @entity15 , 48 , @entity16 , 34 , @entity17 , 30 , and @entity18 , 54 , make up the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) and have been to a total of 16,337 pubs , hotels and wine bars			1
cheers ! @entity19 ( left ) , @entity15 ( middle ) and @entity16 ( right ) from the @entity20 enjoying a pint at their local living the dream : bats have visited a new pub every saturday night for 28 years , they 've been to more than 16,000 originally a team of 20 when it started in 1984 , the @entity21 have now slimmed down to half a dozen men on a serious mission			1
they have vowed to visit very single pub in the @entity10 even going as far as fashioning a rather fetching uniform out of beer towels			1
while it may seem as simple as walking into a pub and ordering a pint , there ’s a strict science behind holding the longest bar crawl world record , as organiser of the group @entity49 , from @entity50 explains			1
stylish : they group were so dedicated that they decided to make their own uniform fashioned out of beer towels banter : the friends look happy together as they share a joke and a pint on an overcast afternoon in @entity50 he said : ' we have our own score cards which we fill in and give to the pub we go to			1
' we write the number of the pub on the card , and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every pub we go to			1
' we also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub , inside and out and make a note of anything special about the place			2
' the men believe they hold the title for the world ’s longest pub crawl , and have kept thousands of souvenirs to prove it			2
including 130 box files full of beer mats and menus and 35,000 photos			2
stamp of approval : the @entity21 legendary commitment has turned them into real ale connoisseurs lads : @entity49 , @entity15 and @entity16 are three of six that make up the mighty @entity20 - there used to 20 members when the club was founded in 1984 every pub they visit is rated , photos are taken and information is noted down and @entity21 approval is a recognised accolade in the local pub trade			1
their almost obsessive hobby demands a certain amount of patience from their partners who sometimes accompany them to the pub - but are strictly banned from the @entity21 regular four - day boozy weekends away			1
@entity113 , 24 , from @entity114 , @entity10 , spoke of her six year relationship with @entity16			0
she said : ' when i started going out with @entity16 , it was clear from the start that beer was part of the package			2
' they have done it for so long , you know what you ’re getting into - you ca n’t complain			0
the @entity21 are committed to finding new pubs in @entity128 and @entity129 - this picture was taken during a visit @entity131 , in @entity133 day out : the gang are photographed at the @entity135 , @entity136 , as they continue the world 's longest bar crawl ' he enjoys his hobby and he lets me do what i want to do , plus it ’s nice to get some time to myself ! ' i do sometimes go to the pub with him on a weekend if they ’re meeting nearby , as some of the other partners do but we ’re not allowed to go on the lads ’ weekends - that ’s definitely more of a man thing ! ' when we go away i ca n’t keep him away from new pubs and breweries - he ’s always trying to hunt out some real ale			1
' @entity16 wants me to learn to drive so that i can ferry him about on his pub trips - good try			2
' dedication : the @entity21 keep a detailed log of pubs they have visited - their approval has become something of an accolade in the local pub trade the @entity21 raise money for childrens ’ hospitals along their way by asking each pub landlord they buy beer from to donate £ 1 to a deserving cause , so far raising over £ 15,000			1
they have also made trips to pubs right across @entity129 but they say these pubs do n't count because they are not in the @entity128			0
the @entity180 public house in @entity181 , @entity50 , @entity10 is one of the team ’s favourite local pubs			0
that 's better : @entity49 raises his pint as the other bats take a sip of their first pint of the day outside their favourite pub local : the @entity21 allow their wives and girlfriends to come for a drink in the week but they are strictly banned from the boozy weekends away owner , @entity195 , 67 , said : ' these men are incredible - they are such a presence in the pub here			1
' they have changed this pub , we used to serve a lot of lager but since they started coming with the knowledge they have of real ales , we sell a lot of the stuff			0
' we get a different crowd in here now , and i love being educated about what they know about real ale			0
calling card : the group invested in personalised beer mats - which they leave in every pub they visit pub number 15,440 ! the @entity220 in @entity221 - the @entity21 have visited 16,337 and have vowed to drink in every pub in the @entity10 ' what they do n’t know about beer , no - one does ! ' i do n’t think their quest will ever end , they will always find new territories when it comes to beer			1
' the @entity21 latest quest is to have been to every pub in the @entity10 by the end of 2014			0
sunshine : the bats were lucky to have a good weather when they visited pub number 15,499 @entity241 , @entity242 rain : the boys endured summer showers to visit pub number 15,520 - the @entity247 , @entity248 historical : pub number 15,491 the @entity250 , @entity251 , looks staunchly traditional from the outside @entity49 added : ' it ’s great to have made it to many milestones , and exciting to think of what we have to come			0
' it ’s hard to think of a hobby which is so much fun			0
' when we ’ve finished our current quest , we will just move on to another county			0
i ’ll be doing this for as long as i can - i intend to visit every pub i can			0
' beer there and everywhere : @entity21 member @entity19 has even written a book about his many experiences			0

the @entity20 have been to 16,337 pubs , hotels and wine bars
they fill in an elaborate score card and leave a personalised beer mat in every bar
women are allowed to the pub but not on boozy weekends away
