by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:51 pm on 16th december 2011 the @entity2 could be called in to decide who will be @entity5 's prime minister - as the @entity7 nation descends into political chaos			1
the island , which will be visited by the @entity10 and the @entity11 next year as part of the @entity14 celebrations , is currently deadlocked			1
two men are claiming to be in charge and their respective police chiefs are maintaining peace and refusing to get involved			1
it comes after sir @entity20 , 76 , was ousted from office by @entity22 in august during the five months he was in @entity23 undergoing a series of heart operations			1
tough decision : @entity2 could be called upon to choose who should be @entity5 's next prime minister power struggle : @entity22 ( left ) took power when sir @entity20 ( right ) was out of the country the @entity32 and governor - general sir @entity33 has backed @entity20			1
the @entity35 court has ruled he was illegally removed from power			2
but lawmakers loyal to @entity22 have passed retroactive legislation recognising him as leader			2
therefore it could technically fall to @entity2 , whose representative in the country is the governor - general , to choose the @entity46 country 's new leader			1
but that would only take place when an absolute majority of the @entity50 votes to sack the governor - general , after which @entity50 must approach the @entity2 and ask her to dismiss him			1
at a news conference yesterday , @entity22 said he had ordered police to take control of government offices , including the prime minister 's office , where @entity20 and his followers were working			2
but @entity22 said he had no authority to issue arrest warrants for @entity20 or @entity61 's ministers			2
protest : @entity22 's supporters have taken to the streets to show their political strength greeting : @entity22 shakes the hands of his supporters after making a speech as heavily armed police guarded state institutions , the police commissioner appointed by @entity22 , @entity69 , said last night there were no plans to remove @entity20 or his ministers from the buildings			0
@entity69 declared the police force would remain neutral			0
he said : ' this is a political situation , this is not a police situation			0
' @entity5 is a @entity46 country and the governor - general is her representative			1
it is technically possible that the @entity2 could be called on to break the deadlock			1
but that would only take place when an absolute majority of the @entity50 votes to sack the governor - general , after which @entity50 must approach the @entity2 and ask her to dismiss him			1
police commissioner @entity88 , who was appointed by @entity20 soon after the @entity32 restored him to power , told the @entity91 newspaper he agreed with @entity69 that police should remain independent of the politicians			2
@entity20 's supporters had tried to flush @entity22 's camp out of @entity96 , which they have occupied since the @entity32 decision on monday , by ordering that electricity and water to the building be cut			0
but @entity102 chief executive @entity101 had refused to carry out the directive , the newspaper said			0
neither @entity101 nor @entity20 was immediately available for comment on friday			0
' we are sick and tired of the selfish behavior by our politicians , ' said @entity108 , head of the country 's @entity110 , which represents tens of thousands of private and public sector workers across @entity5 , a former @entity114 territory rich in mineral @entity115 do n't want a total public service breakdown , and it is coming to that stage			1
' royal guests : @entity120 , @entity11 and prince @entity121 will be visiting @entity5 next year as part of the @entity14 celebrations the stand - off began on monday , when the @entity32 ruled that @entity22 's election by parliament in august was unconstitutional and said @entity20 should be reinstated as leader			1
lawmakers backing @entity22 stormed the gates of @entity33 's official residence on tuesday , demanding he meet with @entity131			0
@entity33 , who represents @entity135 queen elizabeth ii - the country 's head of state - said he would decide by wednesday who should be prime minister			1
on wednesday , @entity33 swore in @entity20 's @entity137			0
@entity20 insisted he did not need to be sworn in , because the @entity32 had already reinstated him as prime minister			0
but a majority of the country 's 109 lawmakers voted later that day to suspend @entity33 and replace him temporarily with speaker @entity142			2
@entity142 then swore @entity22 in as prime minister			0
@entity20 dismissed @entity33 's suspension as corrupt			0
' the only two people who can make a difference are sir @entity20 and mr @entity22 , ' said @entity108 , head of the trade union			2
' they have to calm down and come together for the sake of our people			0
' @entity20 spent five months in @entity23 undergoing three heart operations before returning to parliament september 6			1
@entity114 shares an important trade relationship with @entity5 , which is rich in mineral resources including oil , gold and copper , and crops such as coffee and cocoa			0
