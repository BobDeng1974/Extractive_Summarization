by @entity0 since that discovery , however , questions have arisen not only on its validity , but also its implications for science as a whole			0
and now if might force us to reconsider how the universe formed , with some suggesting the cosmos did n’t start with a @entity10 but rather a ‘ @entity11 ’			1
researchers say that our universe may have begun as a @entity11 rather than just a @entity10			1
it suggests that our universe didn ¿ t necessarily begin from a singularity , but rather ' rebounded ' from the collapse of a previous universe , sort of like how a spring ( shown ) becomes harder to compress as it is squashed the theory was published in @entity20 by a team of @entity23 and @entity24 researchers , and follows up on previous work from other scientists , notably @entity27 of @entity28 in june 2007			1
the @entity11 theory states that our universe did n’t necessarily begin from a singularity , but rather ‘ rebounded ’ from the collapse of a previous universe			1
and evidence for this apparently exists in the data from the @entity36 experiment			2
one of the causes for contention from @entity36 was that it disagreed with previous experiments for how light should scatter in the universe , reports @entity43			1
this meant either one of the experiments was wrong , or our theories for the universe were not quite correct			2
the researchers in their paper ' @entity48 ' have suggested it may be the latter , if the @entity11 theory holds true			1
astronomers in march using the @entity36 telescope in @entity54 detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity10			1
this is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation			0
according to @entity71 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			0
the very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the @entity10 - as they pass through space			2
the theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble			0
' it 's just unbelievable quite honestly , ' professor @entity92 , who helped build the instrument that detected the waves , told @entity95			0
' this is confirming what is , to me , a wacky idea			0
the next step is quite clear ; to confirm the data with another technology			0
' the @entity36 telescope in @entity54 is seen here at twilight			0
the telescope has led to significant new results on the early universe , although its recent results have been called into question			0
the @entity111 telescope and the @entity112 can be seen in the background the theory relies upon something known as loop quantum gravity ( @entity117 ) , which is a way of unifying quantum mechanics and general relavity , itself a manifestation of gravity ’s effect on the universe			1
in basic terms it states the universe can be seen like a fabric of ‘ woven ’ loop that gives space itself an atomic structure , like matter			0
under @entity133 the gravity would become repulse as the universe became more dense , sort of like how a spring becomes harder to compress as it is squashed			2
so , if the universe did collapse , it would eventually expand again when it reached a particular size			0
this process of expanding is known as inflation , evidence for which was found by @entity36			0
in this model there would be no @entity10 as we know it , with the universe starting as an infitiely dense singularity , but there would have been a moment the universe expanded from a small size , itself a @entity10 of sorts			2
this would solve the question of what came before the @entity10 , as it would simply have been the universe contracting before reaching its smallest possible size , and then expanding again			2
it will take further observations from @entity36 and other telescopes , however , to explain if this is correct or not			1
the @entity11 theory relies upon something known as loop quantum gravity ( @entity117 ) , which is a way of unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity ( stock image shown )			1
it will take further observations from @entity36 and other telescopes , however , to explain if this is correct or not			1

researchers in @entity23 and @entity24 propose a new theory for the universe
they say it may have had repeated @entity10 after collapsing previously
the @entity11 theory says our universe was never a singularity
instead it ' rebounded ' after collapsing from its previous state like a spring
if true the theory would help explain *discrepancies* in the @entity36 results
however the researchers warn repeated observations will be needed before the theory can be considered as being correct
@entity11 theory relies on loop quantum gravity , which unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity and describes the cosmos as an ' atom '
