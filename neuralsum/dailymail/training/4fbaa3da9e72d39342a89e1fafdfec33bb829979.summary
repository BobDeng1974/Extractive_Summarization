a @entity1 oil baron and his business tycoon ex-wife have made legal history with a courtroom battle over their £ 6.4million former matrimonial home in @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity10 have followed in the footsteps of their son , @entity12 , to become the first foreign dynasty in which two consecutive generations have sought the aid of the @entity18 courts in dealing with the fallout from divorce			1
mrs @entity10 , a multi-millionaire businesswoman who is boss of the @entity1 equivalent of @entity22 , moved to @entity8 with her husband - a former top executive of giant @entity1 oil company , @entity25 - and their three children in 2003			1
acrimonious : @entity1 oil baron @entity9 and his business tycoon ex-wife @entity10 are fighting over assets in the @entity33 courts battle : at the centre of the row is this £ 6.4m @entity8 home , in @entity38 , which both say they own the family selected a prime piece of real estate as their palatial home on @entity44 in @entity38 , on the banks of the @entity46 , attended by a full compliment of servants , including drivers and cleaners , to see to their every need			1
however , when the pair separated in 2008 , and divorced in @entity1 last year , the house and adjoining land , now estimated to be worth £ 6.4m , became a battleground , with each of the former spouses claiming it belongs to them alone			2
now the former couple have lodged papers with the @entity61 in @entity8 and are each suing the other in a legal tug of war , with the multi-million pound property as the prize			0
the couple ’s decision to bring their row to @entity33 shores follows hot on the heels of a battle between their son @entity73 and his ex-wife @entity74 which made headlines in 2011			1
in that case , the @entity77 upheld a divorce judge ’s decision to award @entity74 £ 2.85m after a marriage lasting just 18 months			0
in a writ , mrs @entity10 says that the off - shore company through which the house was bought in a complex series of transactions in 2004 was beneficially owned entirely by her and that the property was transferred into her sole name the following year			0
although the house was put into her husband ’s name in 2008 , she says it was ' the common intention ' of both of them , right from the start , that she would continue to be ' the 100 % beneficial owner of the property '			0
similar : their couple 's son @entity73 ( left ) lost out to his ex-wife @entity102 ( right ) , who was awarded a £ 2.835m divorce payout after their 18 - month marriage broke down insisting that all expenses - including utility bills , taxes and staff costs - have been paid by her or companies controlled by her , mrs @entity10 says her ex-husband holds the property on trust for her and she intends to give it to their daughter when she gets back legal title to it			1
however , in his defence to the claim , @entity120 , mr @entity9 ’s barrister , insists that his ex-wife owns no part of the house			0
he says mr @entity9 came to love @entity18 as his home and ‘ settled ’ in the house with the then couple ’s two younger children , their niece and his mother - in - law , whilst mrs @entity134 ‘ spent most of her time outside the @entity33 ’			2
and the oligarch insists that the property was transferred into his sole ownership in 2008 as part of the agreed division of their assets , the marriage having broken down partly due to his wish to stay in @entity18 whilst his ex-wife wanted to live abroad			0
mr @entity120 claims the transfer ' had the effect of removing the property from the joint ownership of the couple and transferring it to the sole ownership of mr @entity9 ... as a matter of @entity18 law he is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the property			0
' mr @entity9 has been described as one of @entity1 ’s richest men and his ex-wife is chairman of @entity156 , @entity1 ’s largest domestic producer of grocery goods .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 divorced in @entity1 - now in @entity33 battle
both claim the huge mansion they lived in @entity8 on the @entity46 is theirs
their son @entity12 lost £ 2.3m in a legal battle with his ex-wife @entity74 in 2011
first foreign dynasty to have two generations involved in @entity33 divorce battles
