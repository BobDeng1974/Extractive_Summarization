by @entity0 @entity2 blue whales , the largest animals on @entity4 once driven to near extinction by whaling , have made a remarkable comeback to near historic , 19th - century levels , according to a @entity10 study released on friday			1
the recovery makes @entity2 blue whales - which study authors say now number about 2,200 , or 97 per cent of historical levels - the only population of blue whales known to have recovered from whaling			1
' the recovery of @entity2 blue whales from whaling demonstrates the ability of blue whale populations to rebuild under careful management and conservation measures , ' said @entity24 , a @entity10 doctoral student and lead author of the study			2
@entity2 blue whales , the largest animals on @entity4 once driven to near extinction by whaling , have made a comeback to near historic , 19th - century levels despite the comeback , the whales - which as adults can reach nearly 100 feet in length and weigh 190 tons , twice as much as the largest known dinosaur - are still being struck by ships off the @entity2 coast at numbers above allowable @entity36 limits , according to the study 's authors conservation groups say at least 11 blue whales are struck each year along the @entity36 @entity41 , nearly four times the ' potential biological removal ' level of 3.1 permitted under the @entity43			1
' even accepting our results that the current level of ship strikes is not going to cause overall population declines , there is still going to be ongoing concern that we do n't want these whales killed by ships , ' @entity10 assistant professor of aquatic and fishery sciences @entity44 said			0
though their numbers have replenished , whales are still being struck by ships off the @entity2 coast at numbers above allowable @entity36 limits according to the @entity10 paper and a separate paper published earlier this year , some 3,400 blue whales were caught between 1905 and 1971 , a number determined in part by examining once - secret @entity62 whaling archives			1
the study 's authors say that the population of @entity2 blue whales is now growing more slowly , partly due to ship strikes and also because numbers are reaching the habitat limit			2
@entity2 blue whales are now the only population of blue whales known to have recovered from whaling ' our findings are n't meant to deprive @entity2 blue whales of protections that they need going forward , ' @entity24 said			0
' @entity2 blue whales are recovering because we took actions to stop catches and start monitoring			0
if we had n't , the population might have been pushed to near extinction - an unfortunate fate suffered by other blue whale populations , ' he said			0
' it 's a conservation success story			0

whales still being struck by boats at double the level 's allowed by @entity36 limits
study authors at @entity10 say population is now slowing in growth as it reaches the limits of what habitat will support
an *estimated* 3,400 blue whales were caught between 1905 and 1971
adult blue whales can reach nearly 100 feet in length and weigh 190 tons
