a mother of three who was left bald after spending 30 years pulling out her hair due to stress has told of how it was her ' horrible secret '			1
@entity7 , 42 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her severe hair loss			1
but instead , she was actually suffering from trichotillomania , a rare condition whereby she felt compelled to pull out her locks			1
@entity7 , 42 , was left bald after spending 30 years pulling out her hair due to a rare condition caused by stress			1
above , mrs @entity7 is pictured today with shorter hair ( left ) and with a large bald patch in 2007 ( right ) mrs @entity7 , pictured with her two daughters , now wears her short hair tied up to prevent her from pulling it now , she has finally revealed the truth behind her baldness - and is speaking out in a bid to help others deal with the condition			1
mrs @entity7 , who still suffers from trichotillomania but is receiving professional help , said : ' i ’ve lived with trichotillomania for more than 30 years and it is n’t my dirty secret any more			1
' if people ask me about my bald patch now i tell them truth			2
i ’m not proud that trichotillomania is a part of my life , but it does n’t mean that i ’m not proud of who i am and i wo n’t let this condition change that			2
’ mrs @entity7 , a florist , first began pulling her hair out at school aged 13 to cope with stress			1
she said she felt a ' sense of relief ' after tugging hairs from the centre of her scalp - something she continued to do every time she felt anxious			0
by the time she was 15 , she had a bald patch on her scalp the size of a 50 pence piece			0
treatment : mrs @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , allowed her family and friends to believe that alopecia was the cause of her hair loss			1
above , she is seen having a hair weave attached to her scalp to cover the bald patch more confident : the florist suffers from trichotillomania , a condition whereby she feels compelled to pull out her locks			1
above , mrs @entity7 is pictured having the weave done ( left ) and after , with a full head of hair ( right ) mrs @entity7 's mother took her to the doctor , who diagnosed her hair loss as likely alopecia			1
but at the time , the teenager was too embarrassed to reveal the truth			0
when she met her future husband @entity82 in a pub , mrs @entity7 told him the same story to explain her bald patch			2
the couple married in august 1993 and had their first daughter @entity87 two years later			0
exhausted from tending to her newborn mrs @entity7 noticed she had stopped pulling out her hair , but when the baby started to settle and sleep though she began tugging at it again			1
the couple 's second daughter @entity96 was born in december 1997 , followed by their son @entity99 in september 2005			0
over the following years , mrs @entity7 went to great lengths to hide her condition , burying hair she had pulled out under rubbish in the bin			1
couple : when she met her future husband @entity82 in a pub , mrs @entity7 told him she had alopecia			1
above , the couple only when she read an article about trichotillomania did she realise she was suffering with the condition			1
' until then i did n’t even know it had a name , ' she said			0
' it was my horrible secret			0
’ mrs @entity7 said she contacted @entity117 direct , who urged her to see her gp , but she remained too ashamed to do so ' i was just relieved to know there were others out there even though i did n’t yet have the confidence to seek help , ' she said			2
but as time passed , she began pulling her hair our more frequently and by 2007 , the bald patch on the top of her head was so big she resembled , she said , a ' medieval monk '			1
only when she read an article about trichotillomania did mrs @entity7 realise she was suffering with the condition tattoo : with her 40th birthday approaching , she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words : ‘ you do n’t define me ' ( left )			1
she later shaved off her hair ( right ) attempts to style her hair with hairpieces failed so she began wearing a hat to hide the pink skin			0
it was only months later , while chatting to a friend , that mrs @entity7 suddenly admitted for the first time the truth behind her bald patch			2
she said : ‘ i just blurted it out			0
i waited for my friend to look shocked and horrified , but instead she just asked me why i did it and how it felt			0
‘ it felt wonderful to finally tell somebody the truth and i realised i had to tell my family			2
’ mrs @entity7 said her husband was disappointed she had not confided in him sooner but understood her reluctance to do so , while her close friends also rallied round in support			1
brave : mrs @entity7 , who is still suffering from the condition but is receiving help , said : ' the more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be ' with her secret out , she began looking for professional help and contacted a clinic that specialised in helping people with the condition by attaching a hair weave to the scalp to cover the bald patch			1
in october 2010 , mrs @entity7 went to the @entity181 clinic in @entity182 , @entity183 and left with a full head of hair			2
' it felt fantastic not to have to try and cover my bald spot			0
i could walk out in a breeze without worrying it was going to be exposed , ' she said			0
mrs @entity7 said that the weave also prevented her from accessing the hair underneath the weave , meaning she had no urge to pull it			2
she returned for treatment every six weeks and by august 2011 , 96 per cent of mrs @entity7 's hair had grown back			2
with her 40th birthday approaching , she decided to have a tattoo of the medical diagnostic code of her condition on her wrist along with the words : ‘ you do n’t define me '			0
she hoped it would help stop her from pulling her hair when she saw it			0
but the urges grew stronger and eventually she started again and by december last year her scalp was once again visible			0
finally , mrs @entity7 decided to shave all her hair off in a bid to fight the temptation to pull and turn the tables on her condition , which she described as ' not very well understood '			1
' it is a constant battle for me			0
but the more this is talked about the less stigma and taboo there will be attached to it making it easier for others , ' she said			0
‘ i have found a brilliant community of online support and we all agree that educating people about trichotillomania is the best way to help those living with this secret			0
‘ this disorder can have crippling effects on individuals and there needs to be better understanding and support			0
