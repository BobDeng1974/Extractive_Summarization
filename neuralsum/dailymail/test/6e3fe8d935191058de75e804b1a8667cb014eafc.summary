a two - mile @entity1 railway line which was shut down 50 years ago under a programme of sweeping closures could reopen as @entity5 's longest cycle tunnel			1
the disused @entity6 , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the @entity8 hills , was closed as part of the @entity11 cutbacks , a project which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in @entity5			1
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route			1
@entity50 , leader of @entity51 , said : ' there is a real buzz about this project which could transform these valleys if the tunnel is opened up			1
' the railway tunnel , the seventh biggest in @entity5 , runs beneath the mountains under the @entity60 in the @entity61			2
but engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route the railway tunnel , which runs beneath the mountains under the @entity60 in the @entity61 , was opened in 1890 in the coal boom			1
it was then closed in 1968 it was opened in 1890 during the coal boom , after a five - year building project , which was overseen by the tunnel 's chief engineer @entity74 , a pupil of @entity76			1
but both ends of the tunnel - at @entity79 in the @entity6 and @entity80 in the @entity81 - were filled in during the 1970s			1
it came following a report by dr @entity84 , a civil servant from the @entity85 , who wrote a report called @entity26 , which led to far - reaching changes in the transport network			0
the engineer had been employed to make the entire network more profitable , prompting him to recommend the closure of stations and railway lines which did not make money			0
the tunnel runs from @entity79 in the @entity43 to @entity80 in the @entity81 ( shown in map ) how the tunnel 's length will compare to those around the world , according to the @entity103 under the proposals , it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world , second only to the 4,000m @entity35 near @entity36 in the @entity37 although some 3,000 miles of railway lines were closed before the report , he became infamous for causing the closures of several rural stations			1
the report became commonly known as the @entity26			0
after falling victim to the report , the abandoned @entity6 lay dormant for nearly 50 years			1
but the @entity117 formed a few years ago in a bid to secure funding for the tunnel 's excavation			1
the @entity122 has now contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three - day inspection of the tunnel , alongside the @entity127			2
@entity117 chairman @entity128 said it would be a ' heart - stopping ' three days			0
the chief engineer of the tunnel ( left ) was @entity132 @entity74 , a pupil of @entity76 , who oversaw the five - year building project which it began in 1885			2
pictured right : workers at the @entity137 the @entity122 has contracted a construction and engineering company to undertake the three - day inspection of the tunnel , alongside the @entity127 the @entity117 formed with the sole purpose of reopening the @entity1 locomotive route he said : ' the engineers will be walking the length of the tunnel across three days looking at the safety of the structure to see what it 's like after 47 years and to see if it is possible to re-open the tunnel			1
' as well as the structural integrity they will be checking for such things as sulphuric acid which can occur in stagnant water and to check carbon dioxide levels to make sure it 's breathable down there			2
' he added : ' with the interest of the world looking in on the project , the inspections next week are going to be crucial with engineers being in the dark depths of the tunnel evaluating its integrity			1
' these are exciting times for us but also a heart - stopping three days			0
then we will have the wait for the report and the subsequent findings			0
' the tunnel was built by the demands of the coal industry to run from pit villages @entity79 in the @entity43 under the mountains to @entity80 in the @entity81 the plaque at the @entity79 entrance of the tunnel			2
it is being inspected next week for the first time since it closed engineer dr @entity84 , whose report led to the reduction of the @entity5 railway network in 1963 , dr @entity84 , a civil servant from the @entity189 , was recruited by the government to write a report about how to make the railway network more profitable			1
after being recruited from the job from @entity193 , he produced a report called @entity26 - a document which changed the face of @entity5 railways forever			0
at the time , railway lines were extensive across @entity5 and even very remote areas had stations			2
but , with the industry hemorrhaging money , dr @entity84 's solution was to close down the parts - including stations and lines - which did not make money			2
he recommended axing about one third of the network , which equated to around 5,000 miles of track			0
this included hundreds of branch lines , 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs lost on the grounds of cost or efficienvy			0
his recommendations left @entity5 with 13,721 miles of railway lines in 1966 , while a further 2,000 miles were lost by the end of the 1960s			0
dr @entity84 argued it was more important to invest in fast journeys between the cities and to replace some branch lines with improved bus services			0
but the report became infamous and dr @entity84 was criticised for ignoring the social benefits of having a rail line			0
his programme also never made the savings he promised			0
however , many critics failed to recognise that the government had already cut 3,000 miles of track before dr @entity84 's input , something which was continued by successive governments .			0

disused @entity6 closed 50 years ago as part of sweeping closures
engineers due to visit 3,148m tunnel next week for first time since it closed
cyclists could retrace steam locomotives ' route from @entity6 to @entity46
it would be world 's second longest cycle tunnel , after 4,000m @entity35 near @entity36 , @entity37
