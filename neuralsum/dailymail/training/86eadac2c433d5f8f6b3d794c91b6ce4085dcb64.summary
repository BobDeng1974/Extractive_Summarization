@entity0 was sentenced to four years in prison , after posting violent lyrics about murdering his ex-wife to @entity4 @entity0 claimed he was just kidding when he posted a series of graphically violent rap lyrics on @entity4 about killing his estranged wife , shooting up a kindergarten class and attacking an @entity10 agent			1
but his wife did n't see it that way			0
neither did a federal jury			1
@entity0 , who 's from @entity16 , @entity17 , was convicted of violating a federal law that makes it a crime to threaten another person			2
in a far - reaching case that probes the limits of free speech over the @entity25 , the @entity21 on monday was to consider whether @entity27 ' @entity4 posts , and others like it , deserve protection under the @entity30			1
@entity0 argues that his lyrics were simply a crude and spontaneous form of expression that should not be considered threatening if he did not really mean it			1
the government says it does not matter what @entity0 intended , and that the true test of a threat is whether his words make a reasonable person feel threatened			2
one post about his wife said , ' there 's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you			0
i 'm not going to rest until your body is a mess , soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts			0
' the case has drawn widespread attention from free - speech advocates who say comments on @entity4 , @entity56 and other social media can be hasty , impulsive and easily misinterpreted			1
they point out that a message on @entity4 intended for a small group could be taken out of context when viewed by a wider audience			2
' a statute that proscribes speech without regard to the speaker 's intended meaning runs the risk of punishing protected @entity30 expression simply because it is crudely or zealously expressed , ' said a brief from the @entity72 and other groups			1
but so far , most lower courts have rejected that view , ruling that a ' true threat ' depends on how an objective person perceives the message			0
the high court in @entity81 pictured above on november 18 , 2014 for more than four decades , the @entity21 has said that ' true threats ' to harm another person are not protected speech under the @entity30			1
but the court has been careful to distinguish threats from protected speech such as ' political hyperbole ' or ' unpleasantly sharp attacks			2
' @entity0 claims he was depressed and that his online posts under the pseudonym ' @entity93 ' were a way to vent his frustration after his wife left him and he lost his job working at an amusement park			1
his lawyers say the posts were heavily influenced by rap star @entity101 , who has also fantasized in songs about killing his ex-wife			0
but @entity0 ' wife testified that the comments made her fear for her life			0
after she obtained a protective order against him , @entity0 wrote a lengthy post mocking court proceedings : ' did you know that it 's illegal for me to say i want to kill my wife ? ' a female @entity10 agent later visited @entity116 at home to ask him about the postings			0
@entity0 took to @entity4 again : ' little agent lady stood so close , took all the strength i had not to turn the bitch ghost			2
pull my knife , flick my wrist and slit her throat			0
' @entity0 was convicted of making threats of violence and sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison			1
a federal appeals court rejected his claim that his comments were protected by the @entity30			2
@entity0 claims he was just kidding when he wrote the lyrics and that they should be protected by the @entity30 to free speech the @entity135 administration says requiring proof that a speaker intended to be threatening would undermine the law 's protective purpose			1
in its brief to the court , the @entity140 argued that no matter what someone believes about his comments , it does not lessen the fear and anxiety they might cause for other people			0
' @entity30 does not require that a person be permitted to inflict those harms based on an unreasonable subjective belief that his words do not mean what they say , ' government lawyers said			0
the @entity154 for @entity155 , which submitted a brief supporting the government , said judging threats based on the speaker 's intent would make stalking crimes even more difficult to prosecute			0
' victims of stalking are financially , emotionally and socially burdened by the crime regardless of the subjective intent of the speaker , ' the organization said			0
the case is @entity0 v. @entity79 , 13 - 983 .			1

@entity0 was sentenced to four years in prison after penning ' threatening ' rap lyrics against ex-wife and posting them to @entity4
@entity0 claims that he was just kidding and never *planned* to carry out the death threats
now fighting to *overturn* *decision* by federal jury , on the grounds his lyrics should be protected by @entity30 free speech
