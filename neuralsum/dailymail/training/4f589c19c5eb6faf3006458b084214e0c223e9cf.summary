by @entity1 medical correspondent hundreds of lung cancer patients in @entity3 and @entity4 are to be denied a life - prolonging drug that will remain available in @entity6			1
for the last five years @entity7 has been an option for around 1,000 lung cancer sufferers a year after chemotherapy has failed			1
but the @entity12 rationing watchdog has decided to change its guidance , which experts say will send cancer care ‘ backwards ’			1
@entity7 , a life - prolonging drug used to treat lung cancer patients , is no longer to be available to patients in @entity3 and @entity4 as @entity19 has changed its guidance on the medication the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) has re-reviewed its existing guidance after the chemotherapy drug against which @entity7 was compared went off - patent , leading to a lower price			1
it is the second time in a week that @entity19 has hit the headlines for proposals that would impose new curbs on cancer treatment			2
the prostate cancer drug enzalutamide will be limited to men who have not already tried a different medicine – potentially denying it to thousands of sufferers			0
lung cancer specialists are shocked by the latest draft guidance , saying @entity19 will leave patients with access to only the chemotherapy , docetaxel , which many patients are too sick to tolerate			1
this will effectively leave these less fit patients with no active treatment option to fight their cancer and goes against @entity47 ’s policy which states that no patient will be without access to cancer treatment			2
@entity7 , also known as erlotinib , costs around £ 1,600 for 30 - days of treatment and is taken as a pill at home			2
the drug has been used by about 1,000 patients a year			1
it is given to patients for whom chemotherapy has failed			0

he said it was a backward step that would mean hundreds of patients had to appeal to local areas for permission to use it – even though it remains available nationally in @entity6			0
he said : ‘ lung cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat and the decision to remove what has become a standard of care will make our job as clinicians more difficult , particularly impacting on some of our sickest patients			1
‘ experienced clinicians need more freedom to be able to choose the treatment that they think is right for each patient			0
‘ @entity7 is not a cure but a lot of these patients get good quality of life from using it , ’ he added			2
he said it was a ‘ perverse ’ proposal as independent assessment showed the total @entity12 treatment costs of docetaxel to be higher than those of erlotinib			0
this difference arises because docetaxel needs to be given intravenously in hospital , whereas erlotinib is an oral treatment taken at home			0
the cost of managing treatment side effects is also greater with docetaxel , especially for life - threatening complications which normally require hospitalisation for antibiotic therapy			0
trials show patients get an extra two months of life on average - it increases one - year survival rates by 43 per cent - and the drug costs about £ 1,700 a month per patient			2
doctors say the decision effectively means cancer care in @entity47 and @entity4 is going ' backwards ' @entity19 said draft guidance provisionally recommends both erlotinib and another drug called gefitinib for people with non-small - cell lung cancer in specific circumstances			1
however , this will rule out some patients who would previously have been eligible for erlotinib			0
sir @entity131 , chief executive at @entity19 said : ‘ when we update recommendations , it is driven by changes in the evidence , as we have to be confident that the benefits that drugs offer patients really do justify what the @entity12 will have to pay for them			0
‘ the ongoing review of these two treatments incorporates new evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of erlotinib and gefitinib – the revised recommendations aim to ensure that patients are offered the most appropriate treatments			0

lung cancer patients will be denied @entity7 because @entity154 has changed its guidance on the drug
it **'s** currently an option for 1,000 people a year after chemo has failed
experts say @entity19 **'s** decision will send cancer care ' backwards '
the decision was made because the drug is more *expensive* than an alternative that has just come off - patent
