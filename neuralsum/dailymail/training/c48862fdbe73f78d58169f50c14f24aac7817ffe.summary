by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 8 november 2013 if your @entity3 photos are n’t getting as much attention as you ’d like , it may be down to the filters you ’re using and even the colour of the object your photographing			1
analytics firm @entity9 studied millions of @entity3 photos to determine which shots proved the most popular on the photo - sharing app. the research found blue - tinted images received 24 per cent more likes than images where the predominant colour was red or orange			1
@entity20 - based analytics firm @entity9 analysed 8 million @entity3 photos to see which were most popular			1
it studied each image for 30 different features including different colours , saturation levels , texture , brightness and more			1
predominantly blue images were more popular than red or orange shots , by around 24 % based on the research from @entity32 , to get the most likes for an @entity3 photo make sure the predominant colour is blue , and avoid reds and oranges			1
make sure the blue colour takes up more than 20 per cent of screen			0
leave enough background space , and do n't crop in images too closely			0
use filters such as @entity41 and rise to lower the saturation levels and make sure a flash is used , or the image contains a large of amount of light			0
finally , if you want people to share the image on @entity49 , upload the @entity3 photo via the @entity49 app and do n't click @entity51 directly from @entity3			0
equally , posts with a high proportion of background space attracted 29 per cent more likes than images that were closely cropped			0
the @entity20 - based firm tested 8 million @entity3 posts for 30 different features			1
these included different colours , saturation , how much of an image was dominated by a particular hue , texture , brightness and more			2
as well as checking for the popularity of certain colours , @entity66 discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image gained 40 per cent more likes that multi-coloured images			2
this maybe because one - colour images are rare – @entity9 found 90 per cent of the images analysed failed to have dominant colours			1
lighter photos were more popular than darker photos , by 24 per cent , and highly textured photos got more attention than flatter snaps , by almost 80 per cent			0
in particular , images with lightness levels measured by @entity9 to be between 65 and 80 per cent got almost 25 per cent more likes than images with 0 to 45 per cent lightness			2
this photo would attract a high number of likes because the predominant colour is blue and the blue colour covers more than 20 per cent of the screen , according to @entity9			2
however , it is dark meaning it would n't get as many likes than if it was colourful and the blue is vibrant , while @entity3 users prefer duller colours as well as checking for the popularity of certain colours , @entity66 discovered photos in which one colour in particular dominated the image , such as the green grass in this picture , gained 40 per cent more likes than multi-coloured images - regardless of the colour the saturation levels in a photo also influenced its popularity , and this was predominantly down to the filter that was used			1
@entity3 offers 20 different filters and some , including @entity41 and @entity112 , drain the colour from photos deliberately			2
images with low saturation received 18 per cent more likes than more vibrant shots taken through filters such as @entity119 and @entity120			1
a recent study additionally found that photos can boost the number of retweets a post gets on @entity49			0
the research by @entity127 , @entity129 's social - media scientist , discovered tweets including photos , and in particular photos hosted by @entity49 's own picture service , are 94 per cent more likely to be shared			0
at the other end of the scale , tweets that include links to @entity3 pictures are 42 per cent less likely to be retweeted			0
@entity139 studied 400,000 randomly selected tweets and compared their retweet rates			0
the saturation levels in a photo also influenced its popularity , and this was predominantly down to the filter that was used			0
@entity3 offers 20 different filters and some , including @entity41 , pictured , and rise , drain the colour from photos deliberately			2
images with low saturation received 18 per cent more likes than more vibrant shots			1

analytics firm @entity9 analysed more than 8 million @entity3 images
it assessed features including colour , texture and saturation
blue photos received 24 % more likes , on average , than other colours
red and orange - tinted photos received the *fewest* likes
images with low saturation and block colours were also more popular
