by @entity0 published : 22:46 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 16 july 2013 driverless cars are to be allowed on public roads for the first time after the government today gives the green - light for trials to take place this year			1
most big car - makers are already developing self - drive technology and incorporating elements of it into cars already on the road			1
during the ground - breaking road tests of semi-autonomous vehicles later this year , an expert will have to remain in the driving seat			1
other vehicles being developed by @entity35 ’s @entity34 , @entity39 ’s @entity38 parent @entity36 , and @entity43 ’s @entity41 and @entity42 groups take their cues from their surroundings			0
the @entity27 self - drive @entity48 electric car is controlled by an @entity49 , and the @entity26 team behind it claim the technology could be installed in mainstream cars as a £ 60 option			1
cameras and lasers built into its chassis map a 3d model of its surroundings when it is driven manually , which is fed into a computer stored in the boot			0
no hands : cameras and lasers built into the chassis of the @entity48 map a 3d model of its surroundings when it is driven manually , which is fed into a computer stored in the boot added extra : the @entity27 self - drive @entity48 electric car ( pictured ) is controlled by an @entity49 , and the @entity26 team behind it claim the technology could be installed in mainstream cars as a £ 60 option the car can then ‘ remember ’ routes			2
it prompts the driver via an @entity49 on the dashboard to engage the autopilot and , at a touch of the screen , the car assumes control			0
a laser at the front scans 164ft ahead 13 times per second for obstacles , such as pedestrians , cyclists , or other cars in an 85 - degree field of view			2
if it senses an obstacle , it slows and comes to a controlled stop			0
the driver can tap the brake pedal to regain control of the vehicle from the computer			0
backers say robot cars could lead to cheaper insurance because the vehicle will know what is up ahead on the road better than the driver , who must chose to switch to autonomous driving .			2
