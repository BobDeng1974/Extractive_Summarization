their ' little miracle ' @entity14 was born in the country ’s capital @entity19 on june 16			1

' we just want to bring her home ' : @entity31 , 46 , from south @entity32 , pictured with daughter @entity14 , fears he and wife @entity10 will have to leave @entity14 in @entity19 , @entity4 , where she was born due to passport office delays now the couple - who said they had meticulously followed advice about obtaining a travel document for their daughter - have been told they face a wait of 16 weeks because of extra checks which need to be carried out in a surrogacy case			1
but they are also facing a race against time to apply for an order in the @entity27 that legally recognises them as her parents			1
mr @entity31 , 46 , who is her biological father , said : ' we just want to bring her home			0
i have done a dna test which proves i am her father so surely i should just pass on my nationality ? i do n’t understand why it takes 16 weeks			0
' we are just full of worry			0
it ’s ridiculous , really			0
it ’s going to be at least a month ( in @entity4 ) that we had n’t planned for			0
' mr @entity31 , a chartered surveyor , said he and his wife were given the impression they would be able to bring @entity14 home within three months at the longest			2
he has now returned home to @entity65 , south @entity32 , while his 57 - year - old wife , who runs a human resources consultancy , is still in @entity4 with the baby			1

he said : ' this was going to be our last chance - it was an amazing little miracle			0
it was amazing ( when @entity14 was born )			2

mr @entity31 said they had spoken to officials in the @entity103 in @entity19 several months before the birth			2
he said they were led to believe the application for the baby ’s passport would take around six to eight weeks , or maybe 12 ' at a push '			0
around the time @entity14 was born , measures were introduced to ease the backlog of passport applications			2
this included allowing parents or guardians of children overseas to apply for an @entity26 instead of a new or renewed passport			0
mr @entity31 said they went to apply for the @entity26 at the embassy on friday but were advised that authorities in the @entity27 had warned it would take 16 weeks to process			1
he said he had faced problems checking on the progress of the application since returning to @entity27			0
the couple , who followed advice , had to apply for an emergency travel document after the @entity23 was left in chaos			1
that application has a 16 - week wait due to extra tests required in surrogacy cases he said : ' i rang the passport office on monday and someone rang me back yesterday saying we have n’t got any application from you			1

no one tells you anything			0
' the couple have written to their local mp @entity144 to plead for help bringing @entity14 home			1
their letter said : ' the mistakes made are causing needless distress and worry to us both , at a time when we thought we would be experiencing the happiness of family life			0
' no one would wish for there to be a negative impact on @entity14 because of delays caused by inaccurate advice			2
