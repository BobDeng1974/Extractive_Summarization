by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 06:28 est , 20 may 2013 @entity1 had hip surgery in december 2010 and doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used			1
he is pictured with wife , @entity6 a social worker who cared for people with spinal injuries has sued the @entity10 after he underwent a hip operation that left him permanently paralysed			1
@entity1 , 52 , went under the knife for a routine procedure but doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used			1
the grandfather , who had spent years working with disabled people , asked staff not to use an epidural to numb the area because he was aware of the risk of spinal injury			1
however , staff said it was necessary and administered it while he was under general anaesthetic			2
they then failed to monitor him properly after surgery and his blood pressure fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood - leading to paralysis from the waist down			1
as a result , he is now bedridden			0
the irreparable damage was n’t spotted until nearly two days after surgery when an mri scan confirmed he would never be able to walk again			0
mr @entity1 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , is now wheelchair - bound and completely reliant on around - the - clock care from his wife @entity6 , 55			1
he underwent the procedure in 2010 at the @entity43 in @entity44 - which has now admitted responsibility			1
he said : ' i had spent more than 35 years caring for people with spinal injuries and so i was only too aware that epidurals carry a small risk of paralysis			2
' i had made up my mind not to have an epidural under any circumstances but was told that it was recommended			0
' as a result of the mistakes the hospital made through not monitoring my blood pressure , i will never walk again			1
' my lack of mobility has also meant i have now developed painful pressure sores and for the past year i have been virtually bedridden			2
' i am now completely reliant upon my wife who has to care for me round the clock			2
@entity6 has been fantastic and i do n’t know how i would have coped without her			0
' the @entity64 admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care			0
following the surgery staff at the @entity43 in @entity44 failed to monitor mr @entity1 's blood pressure and it fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood causing him to be permanently paralysed a future settlement , which medical law experts @entity78 are thrashing out with the @entity64 , will provide the lifetime of care and equipment mr @entity1 needs			1
the problems began in december 2010 when he underwent routine resurfacing surgery on his right hip and doctors inserted an epidural to help control post-operative pain			0
in the hours that followed the surgery routine blood pressure checks were missed and by the next day mr @entity1 ’s blood pressure had fallen dangerously low			1
but it was not until two days later that night - staff suspected there was a problem when he appeared to have no feeling or movement from the waist down			2
an mri scan later that day confirmed that he was permanently paralysed			0
mr @entity1 spent two months in hospital and a further six months in a rehabilitation unit			1
he is now virtually bedridden and his wife , @entity6 , has to care for him 24 hours a day as a result , mr @entity1 had to spend more than two months in hospital and a further six months in a specialist spinal injuries unit , before finally being allowed home in august 2011			1
@entity107 , active chief executive at the @entity43 , apologised to mr @entity1 for the blunder			2
he said : ' we are sorry for the complications mr @entity1 experienced			0
a number of allegations have been made regarding his treatment			0
' we have admitted liability regarding some aspects of the management of the complications mr @entity1 experienced and apologised to him			0
' we are committed to providing an excellent service and continually recognise the need to learn from our failings to improve the service we provide to all patients			0
' the @entity64 admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care lawyer @entity129 , from @entity78 solicitors , who is representing him , said : ' @entity1 and @entity6 have been devastated by what has happened			1
' apart from suffering hip pain , @entity1 was a fit and active individual and believed that within a few weeks he would be recovered and back at work			0
' to be told the news that you will spend the rest of your life reliant upon a wheelchair is unimaginable and to discover that this life long injury is as a result of a mistake which was entirely avoidable , has been incredibly hard for them both to come to terms with			0
' sadly this is not the first time that i have dealt with catastrophic injuries resulting from epidurals			0
' although no amount of money will ever turn back the clock for @entity1 , we will now work with the @entity64 to provide @entity1 with the financial support he requires			2
