should @entity0 win promotion to the @entity2 this season they will have to pay @entity3 £ 500,000 as part of the loan deal struck with the @entity7 club for five players			1
the details emerged this morning as @entity0 released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £ 2.89m for the six - month period to 31 december 2014			1
interim chairman @entity14 described the accounts as ' disappointing '			0
@entity16 celebrates after scoring in @entity0 ' 4 - 1 victory against @entity18 on saturday this arrangement with @entity3 was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - @entity24 , @entity16 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
only @entity16 has made any sort of impact for the @entity31 club so far			1
indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for @entity0 , who are currently second in the @entity35 and can only now be promoted through the play - offs			1
the prize money for finishing as runners - up in the second tier is £ 342,000			2
despite promotion to the @entity35 , revenue fell £ 100,000 to £ 13.1m , though the club earned £ 1.3m from hosting the @entity44 rugby sevens			1
sponsorship revenue also dropped , falling by £ 0.3m to £ 0.4m			0
loan signings @entity16 ( centre ) , @entity24 ( left ) and @entity26 are unveiled at @entity48 last month @entity14 , who along with @entity49 and @entity50 , ousted the previous board , said : ' the new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club , its people and its history			2
' the mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering			0
' as the @entity64 prove , the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts			0
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity49 are pictured back at @entity31 after the egm earlier this month ' we can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning , investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders			2
' too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular			0
but they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated , not only for its own good but for the greater good of @entity88 football			0

@entity0 will owe @entity3 £ 500,000 if they win promotion
it is part of the loan deal struck with the @entity7 club for five players
