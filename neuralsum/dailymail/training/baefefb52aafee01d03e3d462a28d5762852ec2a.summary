a university students union has hit out at a @entity2 promotions company for distributing charts encouraging new students to record their sexual conquests alongside when they drink so much alcohol that they vomit			1
@entity7 has been giving out freshers packs which contain charts which are divided into two sides - on one side is a ' shagchart ' - for recording sexual conquests - and on the other a ' chunderchart ' - for tallying how many times students have vomited as a result of binge drinking			1
the company , which bills itself as @entity2 's top events company and boasts on its website of bringing ' you the best value for money and the most exciting events ' , last year was linked to a promotion that featured a t - shirt with the words , ' i was raping a woman last night and she cried '			1
the @entity7 chart which was handed out to @entity2 freshers so they can record their sexual conquests and how many times they vomit after excessive drinking @entity36 has attempted to reach @entity7 for comment , but is yet to receive a response			1
@entity40 vice president @entity39 not only distanced the union from the promotion he called for @entity7 to be banned from the campus			1
he said : ' promoters will try and jump onto everything			0
' @entity7 have absolutely nothing to do with us			0
@entity7 has nothing to do with us , we try and and kick them off			0
they should n't be here , they should n't be on campus			2
' @entity40 does not support , endorse or encourage this sort of promotional material or lad culture , more generally			0
' he added : ' the students ' union has a strict advertising policy that does not allow such material on campus			1
' we believe that the item in the image was distributed by an external company promoting themselves outside of our building and are not in any way associated with the students ' union			1
' @entity66 , the chief executive of @entity67 , which challenges the objectification of women , said young men needed to understand the difference between ' flirting and harassment ' and that anyone who had the chart on their wall was signalling they were ' someone to avoid '			2
the @entity40 has called for the company behind the ' shagchart ' to be banned from their campus ms @entity66 said the company behind the chart was doing ' far more than encouraging young people to enjoy themselves ' , and she hoped the student community as a whole would consider whether they were the type of company they should support			1
the promotion follows research published earlier this month showing that a culture of heavy drinking has led to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women			2
in a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24 - year - olds behave on a night out , a survey has found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping , but few were surprised			0
@entity101 said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned @entity105 ’s pubs and clubs into a ‘ permissive social arena ’			0
the report comes nine years after @entity109 controversially relaxed @entity105 ’s licensing laws to allow 24 - hour drinking despite police , judges , health workers and a @entity116 campaign all warning the policy would prove to be a disaster			0
the findings were revealed in a report for the charity drinkaware , which is urging women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober			2
@entity125 researchers found that 31 per cent of young women said they were touched inappropriately on a drunken night out			2
but only 19 per cent said they were surprised by it			0
in addition , more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) have put up with inappropriate sexual comments or abuse on a drunken night out .			0
