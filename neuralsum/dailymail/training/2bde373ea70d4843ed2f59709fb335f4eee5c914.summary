dozens of @entity1 teenagers , including a young @entity5 girl , have fled the country to join @entity8 militants fighting in @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity1 intelligence has revealed			1
at least 100 girls and young women from @entity1 have left to join terrorists in @entity9 in recent weeks , up from just a handful 18 months ago when the trip was not even on @entity17 's security radar			1
the departures are less the whims of adolescents and more the conclusions of months of work by organised radical recruitment networks that specifically target young people in search of an identity			1
these mostly online networks recruit girls to serve as wives , babysitters and housekeepers for jihadists , with the aim of planting multi-generational roots for a long - lasting @entity36 caliphate			1

in a grainy image caught on security camera , the @entity1 teen tucks her hair into a headscarf			1
just two months earlier and a two - hour drive away , @entity75 , also a teen girl , had embarked on a similar journey in similar clothes			2
her brother later learned she 'd been leaving the house every day in jeans and a pullover , then changing into a full - body veil			2
neither had ever set foot on an airplane			2
yet both journeys were planned with the precision of a seasoned traveler and expert in deception , from @entity41 's ticket for the march 11 @entity95 - @entity94 flight , to @entity75 's secret @entity97 account and overnight crash pad in @entity99			0
the teenagers travelling to join @entity62 come from all walks of life , and although most are first and second generation immigrants from @entity106 countries , many come from white @entity1 backgrounds			1
despite @entity62 repeatedly expressing of deep hatred of @entity5 , there was even a @entity5 girl , according to a security official who spoke anonymously because rules forbid him to discuss open investigations			1

the official , @entity141 , says @entity62 aim to seize the crossing in order to close the noose around the town 's @entity134 defenders and prevent anyone from entering or leaving @entity148			1
the @entity150 - based @entity149 says the militants this morning shelled several areas in @entity140 , including the border crossing , which is the town 's only gateway to @entity138			2
the @entity8 pushed into @entity148 for the first time since launching its offensive in the area in mid-september			1
activists say the fighting over @entity148 has killed more than 500 people			2
young girls are also coming from elsewhere in @entity17 , including between 20 and 50 from @entity150			1
however , the recruitment networks are particularly developed in @entity1 , which has long had a troubled relationship with its @entity106 community , the largest in @entity17			1
distraught families plead that their girls are kidnap victims , but a proposed @entity1 law would treat them as terrorists who will be arrested if they return			1
@entity41 's family has spoken to her three times since she left , but her mother , @entity39 , thinks her communication is being scripted by the terrorists			1
' they are being held against their will , ' says @entity39 , a @entity1 woman of @entity17 descent			1

they 're forced to say things			0

and she seemed to be maturing - she asked her mother to help her get a passport , because she wanted her paperwork as an adult in order			0
on the morning of march 11 , @entity41 casually told her father she was taking extra clothing to school to teach her friends to wear the veil			0
@entity38 stifled his anxiety and drove her to the train station			0
he planned to meet her there just before dinner , as he did every night			0
at lunchtime on march 11 , she called her mother			0
i 'm eating with friends , she said			0
surveillance video showed at that moment , @entity41 was at the airport in @entity95 , preparing to board an @entity94 - bound flight			0

terrorist : the teenage girls travelling to join @entity62 are forced to pledge allegiance to @entity242 ( pictured ) , the leader of the @entity244 group that has raped and massacred its way through @entity9 and @entity10 militant : the teenage girls ' departures are less the whims of adolescents and more the conclusions of months of work by organised radical recruitment networks that specifically target young people to join @entity62 ( pictured ) ' everything was calculated			1
they did everything so that she could plan to the smallest detail , ' @entity39 says			0
' i never heard her talk about @entity9 , jihad			1
it was as though the sky fell on us			0
' @entity41 told her brother in a brief call from @entity9 that she had married to a 25 - year - old @entity266 she had just met , and her @entity268 - born father had no say because he was n't a real muslim			1
her family has spoken to her twice since then , always guardedly , and communicated a bit on @entity97			0
but her parents no longer know if she 's the one posting the messages			0
@entity41 told her brother she 's doing the same things in @entity9 that she did at home - housework , taking care of children			1
she says she does n't plan to return to @entity1 , and wants her mother to accept her religion , her choice , her new husband			1
@entity75 's family knows less about her quiet path out of @entity1 , but considerably more about the network that arranged her one - way trip to @entity9			1
@entity75 grew up the third of six children in the @entity289 family , the daughter of @entity292 immigrants in the tourist city of @entity198			0
her parents are practicing @entity36 , but the family does not consider itself strictly religous			0
not only @entity1 : a number of young @entity150 muslims , including @entity298 ( left ) and @entity299 ( centre ) from @entity301 , and @entity302 from @entity303 ( right ) have also travelled to @entity9 to join @entity62 barbaric : @entity62 rebranded as the @entity8 after declaring the foundation of a caliphate earlier this year she was recruited on @entity97			1
her family does not know exactly how , but propaganda videos making the rounds play to the ideals and fantasies of teenage girls , showing veiled women firing machine guns and @entity9 children killed in warfare			1
the @entity1 - language videos also refer repeatedly to @entity1 's decision to restrict use of veils and headscarves , a sore point among many @entity36			2
@entity75 was 15 when she departed for school on jan. 23 and never came back			0
the next day , @entity324 , her older brother , learned that she had been veiling herself on her way to school , that she had a second phone number , that she had a second @entity97 account targeted by recruiters			2
' as soon as i saw this second @entity97 account i said , ` she 's gone to @entity9 , '' @entity324 says			2
the family found out through the judicial investigation about the blur of travel that took her there			0
first she rode on a high - speed train to @entity99			0
then she flew to @entity94 and a @entity138 border town on a ticket booked by a @entity1 travel agency , no questions asked			2
a young mother paid for everything , gave her a place to stay overnight in @entity99 and promised to travel with her the next day , according to police documents			2
@entity75 's destination was ultimately a ' foreigners ' brigade ' for the @entity349 , an @entity350 branch in @entity9 , @entity324 says			2
the idea apparently was to marry her off			0
but she objected and one of the emirs intervened on her behalf			0
for now at least , she remains single , babysitting children of jihadis			0
she has said she wants to come home - and @entity324 traveled to @entity9 but was not allowed to leave with her			2

' girls are n't there for combat , just for marriage and children			2
' two people have been charged in @entity75 's case , including the young mother			2

she was being commanded by remote control , ' says family lawyer @entity383 ' and now she has made a trip to the pit of hell			0
