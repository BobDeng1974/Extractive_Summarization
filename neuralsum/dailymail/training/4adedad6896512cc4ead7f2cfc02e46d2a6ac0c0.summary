while i love being brown , i hate getting a fake tan			1
having to book a salon appointment the day before a big event , spending the rest of it looking as though i 've been dipped in mud , reeking of that peculiar biscuity smell - there 's nothing worse			1
so when @entity11 announced they 'd developed the 60 minute @entity12 , which can be washed off after just an hour when most demand you sit around for at least four , i was intrigued - especially given the recent storms that have stolen our summer sun. get out of bed ! you can avoid the tanning bed and long spray - tan sessions with @entity11 's 60 - minute tan ' with fake tan , the commonly used chemicals , such as dihydroxyacetone , are activated upon contact with the skin to turn it brown , ' says @entity28 , @entity29 manager for @entity30			1
' but the 60 minute @entity12 contains cutting - edge accelerators , meaning it develops within an hour and wo n't smell			1
you can take a shower after this and go out			2
it also contains a unique ingredient , which is activated when water hits the skin , so the shade continues to darken			0
' it almost sounds too good to be true			0
while you can buy the product to apply yourself ( £ 24.95 ) , i decided to leave it to the professionals			0
the company has more than 2,000 qualified therapists nationwide ( find your nearest at fakebake.co.uk ) who , for £ 25 , will come to your house , set up their equipment and tan you			1
golden success : @entity11 lives up to the hype it 's far cheaper than a salon and you do n't have to suffer the humiliation of staggering home afterwards looking like an @entity58			1
@entity59 , owns the @entity61 salon in @entity62 , and is 20 minutes from my @entity64 home			0
she arrives with a large black pop - up tent , which she erects in seconds in my kitchen			1
i stand wearing nothing but a pair of paper pants while she sprays me up and down with the brown liquid , starting with my arms , then moving on to my legs , bottom , back and finally face			0
the same nozzle is then used to blow warm air to dry my tan			1
in all , it takes just five minutes			0
when she 's finished , i look down enchanted at my smooth brown body			0
my eyes appear brighter , my face healthier and i look half a stone lighter - and i do n't smell			1
i potter around the kitchen for an hour in my dressing gown , waiting for 60 minutes to elapse			0
when i stand under the shower , the water runs such a dark brown that i am convinced that my fake tan has washed off			2
but to my amazement , i emerge looking as though i 've spent the summer on a tropical beach			0
when i take a quick nap , risking pristine white bed linen to see if their claim that the tan wo n't rub off on anything is true , the sheets stay spotless			1
and at bedtime i scrutinise my white t - shirt and pale jeans			2
there is n't a smudge on either			2
my one - hour tan has been a golden success			1
it 's not just advances in speed that are improving fake tans			0
' the tanning market really has produced a tan for every occasion , ' says @entity11 's @entity28			1
' products now come in a range of shades and have added anti-cellulite or anti-ageing ingredients			0
' @entity117 by @entity118 ( £ 37.50 , vitaliberata.co.uk ) contains caffeine , green tea , and a peptide to help break down toxins while @entity12 and @entity123 ( 24.99 , famousdave.co.uk ) has @entity124 to smooth skin			0
@entity126 @entity12 and @entity123 @entity127 @entity128 tanned @entity12 can multi-task as an anti-ageing product - try @entity130 ( £ 22.50 , johnlewis.com ) , or add a bit of glitz with @entity134 's @entity133 ( £ 24.99 , xen - tan.co.uk )			2
temporary , water - resistant versions mean you can scrub off any mistakes with soap and water - such as @entity139 ( £ 4.99 , boots.com ) or @entity140 ( £ 11.50 , boots.com )			2
it 's never been easier to achieve that bronzed glow for summer .			0

skip the tanning bed and *annoyingly* long spray tan sessions
@entity11 works fast - and it does n't smell or rub off !
