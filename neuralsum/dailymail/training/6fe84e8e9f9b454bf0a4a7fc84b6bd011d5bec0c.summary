by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 08:18 est , 14 january 2014 denied : @entity2 has been refused life - saving chemotherapy a grandmother has been ‘ left to die ’ by the @entity5 after being refused life - saving chemotherapy - because her cancer is not ‘ exceptional ’ enough			1
after waiting eight months for the treatment using ‘ anti-cancer ’ drug ofatumumab , @entity2 , 69 , was told she was not eligible for it and there was nothing more doctors could do for her			1
the grandmother of four says she was given no explanation from the @entity17 – which is overseen by @entity18 - except that her condition was not ‘ exceptional ’ enough			2
she was given the devastating news by her oncology consultant , dr @entity21 , at @entity23 ’s @entity22 , who was also baffled by the decision and vowed to appeal it			0
mrs @entity2 who was already ‘ distraught ’ with the news , was then handed a ‘ @entity28 ’ pamphlet by a hospital nurse advising her on what provisions to make when she becomes ‘ too ill ’ to carry out her wishes			1
now mrs @entity2 - who is a full - time carer for her daughter @entity32 , 48 , who has @entity33 and @entity34 - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for @entity18 to change their mind			1
but if their appeal does n't work , she said she will have no choice but to sell her house to pay for the £ 40,000 treatment			1
‘ it 's the only option i 'll have , ’ she said			0
' but then where would i go ? i 'd have nothing left			0
' ‘ after i retired seven years ago i looked after my daughter			1
' i saved the @entity5 thousands doing that and now they ca n't be bothered to fund my treatment			1
' she questioned how she can be refused a potentially life - saving treatment when some doctors are living ‘ champagne lifestyles ’ and being paid as much as £ 1,500 to work in @entity55 units at night – as revealed in the @entity56 on saturday			1
speaking from her home in @entity59 , @entity23 , yesterday she said : ‘ it feels as though i have been given a death sentence			0
‘ i have been left dangling and keep getting fobbed off			0
no one is giving me any answers			0
’ despair : mrs @entity2 - who is a full - time carer for her daughter @entity32 , who has @entity33 - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for @entity18 to change their mind mrs @entity2 , who worked since the age of 18 as a barmaid and shop assistant until she retired , said her doctor recently secured funding for another patient with very similar circumstances			1
ofatumumab , or @entity75 , is a treatment used for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when the cancer drugs fludarabine and alemtuzumab are no longer working			1
the drug is what 's known as a type of monoclonal antibody			2
monoclonal antibodies are made in the lab and used for targeted cancer treatment			2
they recognise and find specific proteins on the outside of cancer cells			0
ofatumumab targets part of a protein called @entity94 on the surface of the chronic lymphocytic leukaemic cells			2
the ofatumumab sticks to all the @entity94 proteins it finds			2
then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them			0
source : @entity103 ‘ it feels diabolical			0
i do n’t feel like i ’m ready to die			0
‘ how can they give one patient with the same condition treatment , but not me ? ’ having already endured a 14 - month wait for the drug , and with her health quickly declining , mrs @entity2 has endured two blood transfusions in the past three weeks in an attempt to keep her immune system strong			1
she has been previously treated with three rounds of chemotherapy , but could benefit from @entity75 - also known as @entity117 - as it can help patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia , when other drugs are not working			1
the mother of three said her main concern is for her daughter and mother who rely on her care and support			2
‘ i have had to stop looking after @entity32 because of this , and that will cost the @entity5 money as she has had to go into a residential home , ’ she said			2
‘ i have people who rely on me , my mother also has dementia , the situation makes me so scared for them if i 'm left to simply die			0
‘ you see all these people who do nothing , and the people who come into this country brand new and they get treatment on the @entity5			1
happier times : mrs @entity2 on her 50th birthday			1
she was diagnosed with @entity144 's lymphoma seven years ago - and says the latest decision feels like ' a death sentence ' ‘ then i come along , having funded it all my life and they say no and leave me to die			1
’ mrs @entity2 said dr @entity150 has approached the drug companies directly to see if they will give his patient the treatment on ' compassionate grounds '			1
‘ if my doctors did n't think i had a chance they would have told me , they would not be fighting so hard now , ’ she said			2
‘ dr @entity21 has been a great support and has done all he can to try to secure the funding , but there 's only so much he can do			2
’ a spokesman for @entity18 said : ' like any treatment , the decision on whether to approve the use of a treatment from the @entity17 is always based on clinical evidence of its effectiveness and clinical benefit for each patient			0
mrs @entity2 aged 33 , with her son @entity172			1
she now fears that without funding for her life - saving treatment , she will be forced to sell her house ' each case is considered on an individual basis and has to meet set criteria , which includes exceptional clinical circumstances			1
' when the decision is taken that a treatment is not of benefit for an individual we understand how distressing this can be			0
the decision is , however , based on whether the treatment will be effective and benefit the individual			0
' there is an opportunity for the patient and their clinician to appeal against the process			0
' a spokeswoman from the @entity196 said : ' we are reluctant to comment on individual cases			0
' however we can confirm that we have applied so far unsuccessfully for exceptional funding			0
we continue to discuss options with our patient , and apologise unreservedly if discussing her care created an impression that there was only one option			0

@entity2 , 69 , was diagnosed with @entity144 seven years ago
has now been told she is not eligible for the ' anti-cancer ' drug ofatumumab
this is despite patients in similar circumstances being given drugs funding
mrs @entity2 is a full - time carer for her daughter who has @entity33
said : ' i saved the @entity5 thousands doing that - but ca n't get funding now '
may be forced to sell her house to pay for £ 40,000 treatment
