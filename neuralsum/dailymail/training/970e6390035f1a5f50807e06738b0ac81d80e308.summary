@entity0 has been surprised by people suggesting the bubble has burst at @entity3			1
an unparalleled talent drain in the summer led to predictions of doom and gloom around @entity8 's , only for @entity10 's new - look side to enjoy the club 's best - ever top - flight start			1
talk of a title challenge and @entity16 qualification soon followed , only for the narrative to quickly change as @entity3 ' season began to go awry			2
the embarrassing midweek @entity19 exit at @entity21 made it five successive defeats in all competitions , so saturday 's 3 - 0 victory against @entity25 was a timely shot in the arm			1
@entity0 ( right ) of @entity3 tussles for possession with @entity30 ( left ) of @entity25 @entity3 's win over @entity25 ended a run of five straight defeats in all competitions the comprehensive win ended @entity3 ' worst losing streak of the 21st century in some style and @entity0 believes highlighted the ludicrous nature of suggestions the bubble had burst at @entity8 's			1
' i think lots of people do n't have a clue what they are talking about , saying stuff like that , ' the @entity46 forward said			2
' i think if you 'd come to watch us and seen the games , you would be happy with the performances			2
' you 'd be disappointed with the results , like we were , but we knew that if we kept doing the right things that things would turn our way and we 'd get that rub of the green and take our chances when they come			0
' that was the case against @entity25			2
i think after the first goal , we kind of played a bit more freely and caused them a lot of problems			0
' to come up with two more to see the game out and keep the clean sheet , it was a positive day all round			0
' @entity0 said the players decided to ' win at all costs ' against @entity25 after the humbling at @entity73 , which had repercussions far beyond dented pride			1
@entity76 and @entity77 were both booked against the @entity78 and , as a result , were suspended for the visit of @entity25 - absentees which saw @entity82 given his first @entity84 start			1
@entity0 praised the impact of debutant @entity82 ( right ) in the victory over @entity25 at @entity8 's @entity87 ( second left ) shoots past @entity88 to score for @entity3 in the win against @entity25 the 19 - year - old academy graduate has been patiently waiting in the wings for his chance and certainly grabbed it , putting in a wonderful display in defensive midfield			1
@entity0 was delighted for @entity82 , who he jokes is like the lead character of @entity98 tv show ' @entity99 ' - a professional ' fixer ' who makes people 's problems disappear			1
' i call him @entity99 because he just cleans up in midfield , ' he said with a smile			0
' i was delighted for him because he trains hard and i was really impressed since the first day i came in			0
' he was waiting for his chance			0
it is hard to get a game with the quality we have in midfield , but two suspensions and @entity113 injured as well , it has given him a chance to shine and he took it			0
' i thought he was immense and did really , really well stopping the ball getting to the attack and breaking up play			0
it was good to watch			2
' as for @entity25 , they approach @entity122 's arrival at @entity123 with their injury problems somewhat improved			1
@entity25 manager @entity125 looks on as his side are beaten by @entity3 in the @entity84 the return of @entity128 is one such boost , with the @entity131 international fit to start again after damaging ankle ligaments and going under the knife in october			1
' i think @entity136 is ready , ' manager @entity125 said of the defender , who has been an unused substitute in @entity25 's last two matches			1
' obviously we had some players back and that is always pleasing			0
' @entity142 is probably the next one and that should be in the next few days			0
' it 's important we get everyone back			2
@entity146 and @entity147 , we 'll assess them in the next few days			0
' and there is @entity150 , so it will be important to get some fresh blood into the side .			0

@entity3 ended a run of five straight losses by beating @entity25
the defeats left *critics* saying @entity3 can not keep up their good start
@entity0 *insisted* they can after the 3 - 0 win over @entity25 at @entity8 's
