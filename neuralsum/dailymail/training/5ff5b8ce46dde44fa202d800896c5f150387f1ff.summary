with @entity2 legend @entity1 announcing his departure from the @entity4 last weekend , rumours have been circulating of a return to north @entity6			1
@entity8 's future as @entity10 boss looks to be secure despite growing unrest amongst a section of the @entity2 faithful which has even led to @entity1 being linked with a management role at his beloved club			1
we asked @entity19 fansite 's @entity17 whether the club 's leading scorer should make a return to the @entity23			0
@entity1 , pictured celebrating scoring in january 2012 , admitted he would love to return to @entity2 @entity1 has announced his departure from @entity25 club @entity4 1994 - 1999 : @entity27 ( 105 lg apps , 20 gls ) 1999 - 1999 : @entity29 ( 16 , 3 ) 1999 - 2007 : @entity2 ( 254 , 174 ) 2007 - 2010 : @entity30 ( 80 , 35 ) 2010 - 2014 : @entity4 ( 122 , 51 ) 2012 - 2012 : @entity2 ( loan ) ( 4 , 1 ) 1997 - 2010 : @entity32 ( 123 , 51 ) @entity27 : @entity33 , trophee des champions @entity2 : @entity36 ( 2 ) , @entity35 ( 3 ) , @entity34 ( 2 ) @entity30 : @entity37 ( 2 ) , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 @entity4 : @entity43 ( 2 ) , @entity44 @entity32 : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 2003 it has not happened yet , but after @entity1 announced the end of his playing career with @entity4 this week , the flying @entity32 dropped a huge hint that he would like to come back to work with the @entity10 and his mentor @entity8 again			1
this is fantastic news for @entity2 fans			2
we still hold @entity1 in our hearts as one of the greatest @entity10 ever			0
unlike some players , there is no animosity at all about his decision to leave			0
at the time there was some doubt about the manager ’s future as @entity66 had left but it was clear when he came back on loan in 2012 that he was still loved unanimously by the @entity2 fans			2
his winning goal in an @entity35 game against @entity71 in his first game back was one of the best moments i can remember			0
and of course his 30 @entity36 goals that spearheaded the @entity10 ’ famous ' invincible ' season will always be one of the greatest achievements of any player and club anywhere			0
little wonder @entity1 is one of only three players , with @entity81 and @entity82 , to have a statue outside the ground			0
@entity8 believes @entity1 will make a return to @entity2 in the future it was not just his success on the pitch			1
the success he helped @entity2 achieve in his eight seasons with us makes him so loved by @entity93			0
the way @entity1 played , with style , panache , pace , verve and @entity99 , epitomises the football that we have become famous for under @entity8			1
@entity1 was a true entertainer and was worth the ticket price on his own			0
at the same time as he called time on his time with the @entity25 club , which almost certainly means the end of his playing days , the 37 - year old changed the picture on his @entity109 page to one of the @entity23			0
@entity1 won two @entity36 titles and three @entity112 during his time in north @entity6 @entity1 changed his cover photo on @entity109 to an image of the @entity23 following his announcement so while our all - time record goal scorer takes a few weeks to consider his options and think about what to do now , it seems clear that a return to north @entity6 is in the forefront of his mind			2
we already knew that @entity2 was the club in @entity1 ’s heart , as he has made no secret of it since moving to @entity30 back in 2007			1
and @entity8 has also stated that he expects @entity1 to come back to @entity2 one day , although he also said that our former star needs to have a real job at the club instead of being merely a figurehead			1
@entity1 spreads his arms wide and celebrates to the @entity2 fans after scoring against @entity133 that would definitely suit the fans , who would love to see @entity1 working with either the first team or the academy players			1
not only does he have an obvious passion for the @entity10 , his career shows that he loves the game and with his intelligence , that would surely make him a fantastic coach and role model			0
whether @entity1 has it in him to one day become a top class manager remains to be seen , but the idea of @entity8 ’s greatest success as a coach taking his place in charge of @entity2 one day is a dream situation for us @entity93			1
come home @entity1 , @entity2 awaits with open arms ! you can follow @entity19 by clicking here			2

@entity1 will always be welcome back at @entity2
