animal rights activists will renew their battle this week to prove a chimpanzee is a ' person ' in the eyes of the law			0
the main player in the landmark case is a little different from most - he is @entity8 , a 26 - year - old former circus chimp who allegedly lives in a cage on a trailer park in @entity12			1
this week judges will hear how the self - knowledge , memory and emotions that make @entity8 so much like humans should give him the same fundamental rights we enjoy			1
i wan na be like you : animal rights activists are renewing their battle to prove @entity8 ( pictured ) is a ' person ' the case is being led by activists for the @entity27 , whose leaders include the renowned @entity30 primate expert @entity29			1
they are suing the animal 's owner and have submitted a 65 - page document to @entity12 's @entity35 insisting @entity8 is granted ' personhood '			1
they say that would grant the animal a ' right over his own body ' and allow them to move him to a sanctuary			0
@entity45 , executive director of the @entity27 , told @entity46 : ' it has n't been tried before so our case is unique			1
' it 's the first time any organisation has tried to get actual legal rights for any non-humans - under @entity54 law animals count as things , not people			2
big name : the plans are backed by renowned @entity30 primate expert dr @entity29 ( pictured in 1974 ) ' there are animal protection laws but that 's not the same as giving rights to animals			2
at the moment they 're just the same as a table or a chair			1
' she insisted being a person under the law was ' not the same as human rights '			0
' the legal term " legal person " is not synonymous with human beings ' , she said			0
' corporations can be legal persons in the @entity54 ' what we 're trying to do is have the court grant legal person rights so our chimpanzee plaintiff can enjoy one simple human right			0
@entity29 is a director of the project			0
another said @entity8 was ' the same as a table or a chair ' ' the last time we saw him he was in a cage in a shed on a trailer park			1
he basically lives in solitary confinement			2
' the campaigners face an uphill struggle			0
@entity8 's owner has previously hit back at the case , saying the animal is perfectly well cared - for			1
and the case was previously knocked down by a lower court , which rejected four bids for ' body liberty ' - for @entity8 and three other chimps , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
ms @entity45 added : ' if we lose , we wo n't stop			0
we will appeal to @entity12 's highest court			1
' the group chose a chimpanzee because the animals are among our closest relatives in the natural kingdom , sharing more than 90 per cent of @entity113 with humans			0
but if they win the case on wednesday , their ambitions go beyond chimpanzees - and they want to create ' person rights ' for other animals species by species			2
the campaigners ' dossier contains references to reams of studies which establish how similar chimpanzees are to their human relatives			2
they add : ' @entity12 common liberty and equality principles compel this court to recognise @entity8 's personhood and fundamental right to bodily integrity			1
' the case has echoes of the so - called ' monkey selfie ' , which made headlines when photographer @entity138 insisted he owned a picture taken by an ape on his camera while he was on a shoot			0
@entity54 copyright authorities felt differently - and said the photograph was anyone 's to use for free			0
they did , however , stop short of granting the monkey the copyright			0
the @entity149 will hear the case on wednesday and is expected to give its judgement within the next two months .			2
