by @entity1 reporter published : 12:19 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 12:38 est , 30 january 2014 a college professor who paints @entity4 as a freedom fighter and the @entity6 as a ' neocolonial power ' in a textbook he co-authored has listed it as required reading for his students			1
@entity12 requires students at @entity14 in @entity14 to read the book entitled ' @entity16 '			1
' the @entity20 movement of @entity4 is one example of an attempt to free a country ( in this case , @entity24 ) from a corrupt and repressive regime propped up by a neocolonial power ( in this case , the @entity6 ) , ' the book says			1
while he requires students taking his @entity31 class to read the book , he does not make them pay for it and instead provides them with a free copy online			1
teachings : dr @entity12 , left , a political science professor at @entity14 requires his students to read his textbook , in which he describes @entity4 , right , as a freedom fighter but one of his students , @entity38 , who calls himself a proud conservative , was shocked by what he has called ' indoctrination '			1
' it totally blew my mind that a professor would essentially call @entity20 a bunch of freedom fighters in required reading for class , ' @entity38 , a junior who took the class in the fall semester , told @entity52			2
but when asked about the sentence about @entity4 , @entity12 said that he simply presents facts and does n't make a value judgment on them			1
' with respect to my writings , they are empirical , not normative , ' he told @entity52			2
@entity38 said the class leaned to the left for the entire semester , which he thought was irresponsible			0
' he was encouraging us to be activists , ' @entity38 said			0
' the whole last part of the course was about how to cause " positive change " ... but his examples of positive change were all stuff like @entity71 , the @entity72 , and raising the minimum wage			0
anger : student @entity38 , who took the class last semester , complained that the class was too left - leaning and focused on sustainability , which he claimed did a disservice to the students ' he would say things like , " i know you guys can go out there and make things more sustainable " , ' @entity38 said , citing this as a problem			1
book : he co-wrote the book , @entity16 , which he provides to students for free in an opinion piece for @entity92 , he added that @entity12 brought a covered @entity94 representative talk to the class about the @entity96 , convincing students to sign up			1
' his slant does a disservice to @entity14 students , ' he wrote			1
' and in my mind it rises to the level of academic malfeasance			0
' after he had secured his grade , he reached out to his professor about his concerns with the class			0
@entity12 responded that he had listed his intentions for the class in the course description			2
' course evaluations sometimes include comments similar to yours , which encourage us to make the goals and focus of the course as explicit as possible , ' @entity12 wrote			2
' i 'm sorry if i did n't accomplish that as well as i could have in your case , but am pleased you didnâ € ™ t un-enjoy the class ! ' @entity12 said his one bias is towards sustainability			2
he said he outlines this in the course description			0
' @entity31 has a built - in slant : on sustainability , ' @entity12 said			2
' we do not focus on " the other side " - how we might build more unsustainable food systems			0
' @entity38 said his political views did n't affect his grade , and called @entity12 ' a funny professor with a lot of interesting things to say ' , in an opinion piece for @entity92			2
classroom : @entity12 teaches in @entity14 and says he explains what the class covers in its description ' i found the course to be very thought - provoking , ' he said			1
' these issues should be discussed in a college class			0
but @entity12 only showed the liberal side of each issue			1
while i enjoyed the class , i would have liked to have heard counter arguments			0
' other reviews about dr @entity12 posted online by students are far more flattering and thanked the professor for challenging their views and opening their minds			1
' the most powerful , insightful , eye opening class ever taken at @entity14 , ' one student wrote			1
' if you are not open minded do not take this class			0
you do not deserve to be lectured on ways to change this world			0
people with strong moral and ethical character take this class			0
you will understand the way the world truly is and how you can deal with it or change it			0
' another added : ' @entity31 is a class that everyone should take ... it will change your life ! '			0

dr @entity12 requires his students at @entity14 to read his book , in which he calls the @entity6 a ' neocolonial power '
he said that he presents the facts without making a judgment on them
but a student has taken issue with the ' indoctrination '
