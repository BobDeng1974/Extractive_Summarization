caretaker manager @entity0 has defended his team selection after admitting that @entity2 went out of the @entity3 with a whimper against @entity5			1

some @entity14 fans criticised @entity0 , who plans to apply for the job of head coach , after seeing their only hopes of winning a trophy this season go up in smoke at the @entity20			1
@entity2 's stand - in boss @entity0 reacts during the defeat at @entity5 in the @entity3 on saturday @entity22 headed the only goal of the game just before half - time			1
it was a rare moment of brilliance in a game low on quality , despite the tie being the only one played on saturday between two @entity12 teams			2
a large proportion of the 4,319 travelling support turned on their team late on and even booed the @entity2 players , together with @entity0 , at the end of the game as they came over to applaud the fans			1

@entity2 fans shouted abuse at their team at the end of the @entity3 third round match defeat @entity2 players look dejected after the final whistle as @entity51 applauds the travelling fans ' @entity41 is coming into a new culture from @entity55 football and he 's one of our best players - one of our shining lights in a season when we did n't even expect him to be in the team			1
' we thought he 'd be one for the future , but he 's gone into the team and has been outstanding			2
' if you had seen him after the @entity11 game or the following morning at the training ground , he 'd ran out of fuel			2
for me to take a massive gamble 48 hours later with him would have been too big a gamble			0
' @entity0 also explained the other big - name absentees			1
he continued : ' @entity70 had a problem with his groin			0
@entity2 caretaker manager @entity0 saw his side lose to @entity5 in the @entity3 on saturday ' @entity75 - both of his hamstrings were tight and i did n't want to risk that			1
' [ @entity81 ] @entity80 had a problem with a nerve leading into his buttock			0
@entity86 we lost because of a snapped achilles			0
' even the morning of the game we had @entity89 travel with us despite having a tight hamstring			0
unfortunately he felt worse and did n't play			0
that 's why i did n't take the gamble and he was n't even on the bench			2
' sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture			0
this was just one game , the future of this football club is over the next few weeks			0
' @entity5 boss @entity103 was also left counting the cost of injuries			1
@entity22 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity5 beat @entity2 in the @entity3 @entity108 added to @entity103 's problems when he limped off with a tight thigh in the first half , leaving four of @entity5 's central midfielders - @entity108 , @entity113 ( thigh ) , @entity115 ( groin ) and @entity117 ( calf ) - nursing knocks			1
' @entity108 came off as a precaution , ' said @entity103 , who , like @entity0 , also made seven changes to his starting line up on saturday			1
' @entity115 had a scan the other day , and is not a long - term problem			0
' @entity113 is out , but should be back by next week			0
@entity117 is out , he 's got a tight calf so could n't play			0
so , we 've got a few players to nurse through this period			0
' @entity5 manager @entity103 , talking to @entity0 on the touchline , has a host of injuries in his squad @entity133 is set to go to the @entity134 , as is @entity135 , although his departure is now in doubt after he suffered a knee injury in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity140			1
@entity135 is part of @entity143 's provisional 31 - man squad for the competition that begins on january 17 and was due to fly out for a week 's training camp on monday before the final 23 - man squad was selected			2
@entity103 said : ' i am not saying he wo n't go , what i am saying is we will see how he is this week before he potentially joins the training camp			0
