the third , and final , supermoon of the summer lit up the sky last night , with stunning new photos showing the beauty of this rare occurrence			2
these moons are caused when a full or new moon coincides with the @entity8 's closest approach to the @entity9 , also known as its perigee , the spot closest on its oval orbit			0
this event occurred two other times this summer , on july 12 and august 10			0
as tonight 's moon is also the full moon that falls closest to the fall equinox , it is also a @entity36			1
this is actually the fourth supermoon of this year , with the first happening right off the bat , on january 1			2
sadly though , it will be a long time before another one of these nights comes along , with the next supermoon happening on sept. 28 , 2015			1
