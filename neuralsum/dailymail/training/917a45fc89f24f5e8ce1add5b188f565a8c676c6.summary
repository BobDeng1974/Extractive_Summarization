' a lot in common ' : @entity1 with fourth wife @entity2 and 30 - year - old daughter @entity3 by her own admission , she and her father do n’t always see eye - to - eye when it comes to her work			1
and when @entity1 ’s daughter @entity3 unveiled her latest stand - up show , it was n’t difficult to see why			0
the 30 - year - old comic devoted almost half of her set to making jokes at the expense of her 74 - year - old father – and his wives			2
as well as describing the @entity23 star ’s current wife @entity21 , 42 , as ‘ a child ’ and his ‘ soul mate du jour ’ , miss @entity20 referred to his third wife , @entity26 , as ‘ @entity27 ’ , or the devil			1
she also likened her family to tumbleweed ‘ rolling along picking up dirt and debris ’			1
miss @entity20 – whose mother is the late @entity33 artist @entity32 , her father ’s second wife – told a sold - out crowd at @entity36 : ‘ i ’m still single and it ’s weird because my parents set an amazing example			1
‘ they ’ve been married for almost 42 years – to seven different people			0
not at the same time , we ’re not mormon or anything like that , not even close			0
‘ if most people have a family tree , we have a family tumbleweed , it just keeps rolling along picking up dirt and debris , nobody knows how they are related to anyone else , we just know not to f * * * each other , because we ’re not @entity53			1
’ the 6ft 1in comedienne then turned her attention to @entity56 , who became @entity20 ’s fourth wife two years ago , saying : ‘ recently i got a surprise , we got a new child in the family , it ’s pretty cool , my new step - mum			1
' soul mate du jour ' : miss @entity20 described her father 's current wife @entity2 ( left ) , 42 , as ' a child ' ‘ my dad , about two years ago , married lucky number four , his soulmate du jour			1
she ’s great , we actually have a lot in common – we ’re both six foot , blonde and inappropriately aged to be married to my dad			0
but she ’s really nice and i ’m not , so that ’s different			0
’ miss @entity20 saved some particularly barbed jibes for @entity74 , 69 , who she dubbed ‘ @entity76 … fer ’ – leaving the audience in no doubt that she was making a reference to @entity27 , or @entity80			1
miss @entity26 ’s £ 12million settlement in her 2008 divorce from @entity20 forced the comedian to come out of retirement and launch his @entity85 , and miss @entity20 has previously accused her of driving a wedge between her and her father during their marriage			1

‘ she had two sons who were both horrible people and they were up in @entity116 , it ’s weird , we have nothing in common , we were related i guess but not any more			0
‘ one of them , @entity123 , he ’s colour blind , he ca n’t see colour at all , do n’t get me wrong , he ’s super racist			0
he ’s just red - green colour blind , i guess he just sees shades of grey , so to him , @entity130 is just one big f * * * you			0
‘ so , a few years ago for @entity130 i gave him a @entity133 , now he thinks he ’s like world champion , he tells everyone that			0
‘ i guess it just p * * * * * me off because my parents have always said he was the gifted one and it ’s messed up because if you think about it people say a child is a gift , right ? so , technically , all children are gifted , even me			2
