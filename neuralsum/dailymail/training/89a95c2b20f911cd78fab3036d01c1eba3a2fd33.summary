@entity0 denied @entity1 both their pizzas and a point on saturday as debutant @entity4 answered @entity6 's call to score some quick goals			1
@entity1 's request for the @entity10 dish to be left in their dressing room at full - time was turned down by @entity0 - surprising considering they are heavily under the @entity14 influence of owner @entity6 - but they had more to worry about than pizza as @entity4 's 88th - minute debut goal condemned them to a 1 - 0 loss			1
@entity4 signed from @entity19 on wednesday as @entity20 responded to @entity0 ' opening - day defeat at @entity22 and was immediately told by the former @entity24 owner to ' hurry up and score some goals '			1
winner ! @entity4 wheels away after scoring the winner on his @entity0 debut against @entity1 the 28 - year - old left it until two minutes from time to obey the command but was in the right place at the right time to finish after @entity36 failed to hold @entity38 's shot			1
the late drama will have left a sour taste in @entity1 's mouth for it was they who did most of the running throughout and , to almost everyone in the ground , scored a legitimate opener through @entity45 which was ruled out			2
it was @entity4 who would have the final say , though , getting due reward for a grafting performance which nearly brought about a goal after only two minutes			2
celebration : @entity0 owner @entity6 ca n't hide his delight after @entity4 's last - gasp winner did you see that ? @entity6 makes sure everyone around him knows that @entity0 have just taken the lead @entity0 : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 86 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 75 ) , @entity70 ( @entity38 54 ) , @entity4 , @entity71 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 @entity1 : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ( @entity82 60 ) , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 ( @entity86 85 ) , @entity87 - 75 ' ) subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 ref : @entity92 att : 44,484 he ran on to a @entity70 flick and got into the box , only for @entity36 to get out and smother at his feet			1
the ball then came free and fell to @entity68 who , from 10 yards out , should have scored and not hit the recovering @entity79 on the line			0
that was as good as it got for @entity0 in the early stages and they were soon being pinned back by a @entity1 side who passed the ball round at a pace quicker than @entity0 could deal with and really should have been ahead 26 minutes in			0
@entity65 failed to deal with a long throw into the box and turned to see @entity83 overhead kick his half - clearance beyond @entity60			0
it looked a clean goal but referee @entity113 had spotted an infringement and chalked it off			0
@entity66 was the next man to put his body on the line to keep @entity0 level , diving in front of a @entity85 effort as the hour approached , with @entity62 then displaying his defensive nous once more to nip in and block of @entity124 as he ran through			0
@entity0 ' best chance of getting something appeared to be under the suspect handling of @entity36 who never looked comfortable under a cross and , with 11 minutes left he failed to reach a @entity67 centre but @entity4 was unable to punish him from six yards			1
but the former @entity132 man was on the spot as time ran down , showing the required poise to slot in after @entity36 allowed @entity38 's drive to slip away from him			0
tight affair : @entity0 ' @entity62 tackles @entity1 's @entity45 in what was a closely fought match unfortunate : @entity1 were unlucky to have a goal chalked off before falling behind late on			2

@entity4 scored in the 88th minute to secure the win for @entity0
the *striker* only *joined* from @entity19 on wednesday
it was the @entity150 club 's first win in the *championship* this *season*
@entity0 owner @entity6 celebrated the win in the stands
