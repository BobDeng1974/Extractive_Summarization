as they splash around in their tanks , they look like any other healthy @entity4 salmon			2
their eyes are bright , their skin is gloriously silvery and their fully grown bodies exude power			0
it ’s only when you look closely at their hatching dates that the alarm bells start to ring			0
a normal @entity4 salmon takes 30 months to grow to maturity			1
this variety took just 16			0
the majestic specimens are ‘ frankenfish ’ — genetically modified salmon created in a secretive research base in the @entity23 rainforest			2
' frankenfish ' are genetically modified salmon created by company @entity26 which grow at twice the rate of wild @entity28 , and are constantly hungry ( file picture ) the salmon have been given genes from two other species of fish to make them grow twice as fast as normal			1
and while most people would baulk at the prospect , @entity35 fish could soon be coming to a dinner table near you			1
last week , @entity41 authorities gave approval for the commercial production of @entity35 salmon eggs for the first time , while @entity47 food regulators are in the final stages of approving the fish for sale in supermarkets and restaurants			1
and where @entity35 salmon lead , other animals will follow			1
plans are in place to genetically modify up to 50 other species , including trout and the tropical white fish tilapia , for human consumption			0
@entity35 chickens , cattle , sheep and pigs wo n’t be far behind			2
the prospect of the first commercially produced @entity35 livestock has , not surprisingly , raised concerns			2
even those who support @entity35 crop production believe the risks involved in @entity35 animals are simply too great			2
so what is so dangerous about these innocuous - looking fish ? and could they be served in the @entity76 soon ? @entity35 salmon are the creation of @entity26 , a biotechnology company based in @entity79 and listed on the @entity80			1
the firm has owned the rights to produce @entity35 salmon since 1996			1
it also produces feeds to speed up the growth and boost the immunity of farmed shrimp			0
the fish have been given two genes from other species — a growth hormone gene from the @entity93 salmon , the largest of the @entity95 salmon species , and a gene from the eel - like ocean pout which ‘ switches on ’ the growth hormone			1
the combination of these two genes allows the @entity35 salmon to keep producing a growth factor hormone — the substance that triggers their metabolism to eat more and put on weight — all the year round			1
the farmed fish have been given the growth hormone from the @entity93 salmon and a gene from the ocean pout which switches the growth gene on normal young salmon , in contrast , go through growth spurts only in the spring and summer			2
the rest of the year — when food is less scarce — their growth slows dramatically			0
with growth hormone coursing through their bodies , the @entity35 salmon can reach market size of around 13lb in 16 to 18 months , making them cheaper to produce			1
@entity26 is spreading the production and marketing of the @entity35 fish over three countries			1
around 100,000 salmon eggs will be created every year in its factory at @entity129 , @entity41 , before being shipped to @entity23			1
there they will be grown into adults in landlocked ‘ sealed tanks ’ for 18 months , killed and sold in the @entity47 pro-gm scientists insist there is no reason why @entity35 food should be any more dangerous to humans than ordinary food			1
after all , mankind has been tampering with the genetic make - up of animals and plants since the dawn of farming through selective natural breeding			0
genetic modification , they say , is simply a more precise addition or subtraction of genes			0
but there are two major differences with @entity154 in animals and plants that once took centuries can now take place within just one generation			0
and genes from one species can be added to another			0
tomatoes can be given anti-freeze genes from @entity165 fish to make them withstand frosts			0
@entity168 can be given genes from daffodils to make it a rich source of @entity173 critics say the combination of genes from different species could have unforeseen consequences			0
while the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) found no worrying differences between the meat of @entity35 and ordinary fish , no one has yet been able to show whether the fish are safe over many years of consumption			1
while the salmon are meant to be farmed if they do escape they could breed and wipe out wild fish and according to @entity47 charity @entity190 , there are significant differences between @entity35 and conventional farmed salmon			1
@entity35 salmon appears to have less omega 3 — the fatty acid that can protect against heart disease			1
it also appears to have higher levels of a growth hormone called @entity200			0
studies of a small number of salmon suggest that six nutrients are present at values that differ by more than 10 per cent			0
the @entity35 variety had less folic acid , less zinc , less magnesium and less phosphorus — but more niacin and vitamin @entity211			2
the findings suggest ‘ potential food quality differences ’ , according to the charity @entity190			0
there are also concerns that @entity35 salmon could have more allergy - triggering chemicals			1
the @entity179 concluded that was not the case — but its findings were based on a study of only six fish			0
this is not enough evidence to conclude that @entity35 salmon is harmful			1
but it raises questions which have not been fully answered			0
there are more concerns about the threat to the environment they pose			0
wild @entity4 salmon are already threatened by over-fishing and the accidental release of farmed salmon			2
introducing a population of bigger , tougher and faster - growing salmon could finish them off			2
dr @entity241 , who has grown his own variant of @entity35 salmon at the @entity243 in @entity244 , says they are more aggressive than conventional fish			1
‘ they ’re hungry all the time , ’ he told @entity246			0
a study at @entity248 in @entity249 this summer found that @entity35 salmon can breed with wild brown trout , creating a hybrid that grows even faster than the @entity35 salmon			1
in a simulation , the hybrid ate far more food than wild fish sharing the same waters , and led to wild fish being far smaller than they should have been			1
@entity47 food regulators are about to approve the fish for sale , while @entity41 has given the go - ahead for the production of @entity35 eggs for the first time ( file picture ) @entity26 insists that wo n’t happen because it processes the eggs in its factory to make the fish sterile and so unable to breed			1
however , data from the company suggests the process is not 100 per cent effective			0
and , according to regulators , it needs to make only 95 per cent of eggs sterile			0
@entity26 also says the risks of escape are minuscule because the fish will be stored in secure tanks miles from the sea			2
but the experience in @entity282 — where at least two million farmed salmon have escaped into the wild in the past decade — shows that keeping salmon secure is difficult			2
just last month , thousands escaped from a ‘ secure ’ @entity288 farm and could now mate with wild salmon			2
the @entity290 says no company has yet applied to the @entity292 to farm commercially or import @entity35 fish into @entity294			1
approval from the commission would need a rigorous environmental risk assessment from the @entity298			0
but @entity294 firms are watching closely			0
and the technology has supporters at the heart of @entity303			0
the previous chief scientist sir @entity304 warned three years ago that the world faced a ‘ perfect storm ’ of a growing human population , food shortages and climate change			0
he argued it was hard to justify not using @entity35 to feed the world			2
it is possible that canned imported @entity35 salmon could arrive in the @entity76 within the next few years ( file picture ) @entity35 fish farms are unlikely in the @entity76 for the foreseeable future			1
but , as pressure from scientists and biotech companies grows , it is possible imported canned @entity35 salmon could arrive within the next few years			1
fish experts are deeply concerned			0
sir @entity322 , author of @entity323 , believes @entity35 salmon almost certainly will get into the wild			1
‘ @entity323 are incredible survivors ’ , he says			0
‘ they survived the industrial revolution in @entity328 where water wheels went up every five miles of river			0
they survived in the @entity331 when it was an industrial sewer			0
‘ with the aid of its @entity35 boost , who knows what this fish will be capable of doing			1
’ and once in the wild these super-charged , aggressive salmon — with their year - round appetite — could be devastating for the endangered natural wild salmon beloved by anglers and conservationists			1
and that way could be into the @entity4 , into @entity76 waters and ultimately onto our dinner plates .			2

@entity35 salmon which grow twice as fast as wild fish have been developed
eggs given go - ahead in @entity41 while meat to be approved for sale in @entity47
if they escape from farms they could breed and wipe out wild fish
imported canned products could be in the @entity76 within years
