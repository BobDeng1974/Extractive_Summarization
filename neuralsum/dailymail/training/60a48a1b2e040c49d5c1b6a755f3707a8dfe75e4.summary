@entity0 looks set to stay as @entity2 manager despite the club 's woeful start to the season			1
the @entity6 looked to be on borrowed time following the abject 4 - 0 defeat at @entity9 and it was thought he would be sacked by @entity11 on thursday			1
however , the club confirmed @entity0 would be at the pre-match press conference on friday ahead of the home clash with @entity15			1
@entity0 ( centre ) is at a loss as @entity2 are hammered 4 - 0 by @entity9 at @entity18 the @entity20 table @entity2 chairman @entity21 has been loyal to @entity0 , who has had to cut costs and work within tighter budgetary constraints			1
results and recent performances had put pressure on @entity2 to make a change before they get cut adrift by the teams above them but it seems as if this has been resisted			2
there were financial considerations to any sacking and it has been suggested that @entity11 could not afford to get rid of @entity0 , whose contract runs out at the end of the season			2
@entity2 have won just once in the championship this season and are second from bottom with only @entity41 - who only had eight players the day before the season started - below them			1
the players do not seem to be playing for @entity0 and the manager , who talked in an interview last week about trying to find a settled side , chops and changes frequently - there were five against @entity9			1
this has led to some horrendous performances , home and away			0
the fans have lost patience with him , too , as the vocal minority have become the majority			2
there were pitch invasions against @entity62 on saturday and chants for the manager to go at @entity18			0
@entity0 and his no 2 @entity65 leave the pitch after a chastening night for the @entity2 manager @entity0 's apparent inability to acknowledge that his actions play a part in the current struggle has infuriated supporters but even after a display as rancid as the one at @entity9 , he still insisted he was the right man for the job and that there was a ' good spirit ' among the players			1
he told the @entity79 : ' i ’m here to work , i ’m here to do my very best and that ’s what i ’m doing right now			0
' i do n’t think that way at all ( about being sacked )			0
i ’m working very hard to turn this round			0
' i do n’t think the players have chucked the towel in , i think they have shown a very good spirit			0
they have shown a good spirit and kept on going			0
' it looks as if he will get another chance against @entity15 at the weekend .			0

@entity0 will be at pre-match press conference on friday
@entity2 are 23rd in @entity20 following 4 - 0 defeat by @entity9
