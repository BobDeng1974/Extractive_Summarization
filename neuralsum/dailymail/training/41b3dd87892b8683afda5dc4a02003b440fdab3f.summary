by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 09:34 est , 22 may 2012 ' getting poorer ' : hikes in bills and travel costs are making it increasingly difficult for families to keep up the cost of living in @entity8 remains cripplingly high , with inflation currently five times greater than the average pay rise given to workers			1
the @entity12 revealed the consumer prices index measure of inflation dropped from 3.5 per cent in march to three per cent in april			1
but the average pay rise is a paltry 0.6 per cent , far behind the high cost of living , which experts point out means ‘ people are still getting poorer every month ’			1
in a further blow , the long - awaited drop in inflation to its lowest rate for more than two years came because of largely superficial reasons			2
this year ’s eye - watering hikes in household bills and overseas travel were not included in april ’s inflation figures because @entity27 was much earlier this year than it was last year			1
for cash - strapped families , the pain remains , with almost all their bills continuing to rise far more quickly than the modest rise in their take - home pay			0
every @entity27 , the cost of air fares and sea fares rockets to take advantage of people who want to go abroad for the holiday , such as parents with school - age children			2
the @entity12 said around half of the drop in last month ’s inflation figure was caused by this year ’s early @entity27 holiday			1
economists said the drop in inflation was ‘ distorted ’ by the timing of the four - day holiday , with others saying it could just be ‘ a statistical quirk			2
’ the bills nobody can avoid , such as food and heating , keep on rising			2
over the past year , food prices have jumped by 4.2 per cent			1
gas bills are 15.4 per cent higher than last year , while electricity bills are up 8.1 per cent			1
in april , the @entity12 said petrol prices reached a record of £ 1.42 per litre , up 3.2p per litre , and diesel prices also hit a new all - time high of £ 1.48 per litre , up 2.1p			0
the average family must spend an extra £ 1,035 if they want to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed last year , according to the retirement income firm @entity69			1
for many families , this is impossible , and they are having to make drastic cutbacks or eat into their savings to stay financially afloat			0
@entity74 , general secretary of the @entity75 , said : ‘ with earnings growing by just 0.6 per cent , people are still getting poorer every month			0
’ to make matters worse , economists predict inflation will not continue on its downward path			0
@entity82 , senior economic adviser to the accountant @entity84 ’s @entity83 , said : ‘ these figures were heavily influenced by @entity27 being earlier this year , with the impact on air and sea fares reducing inflation by almost 0.3 percentage points			1
‘ but we would expect this to reverse next month			0
’ last week , the @entity93 ’s authoritative @entity92 warned inflation will remain above the target set by the government of two per cent for even longer			0
it said : ‘ @entity92 [ is ] likely to remain above the two per cent target for the next year or so			0
’ @entity98 , the old age experts , said inflation is hurting older people more than younger people			0
since september 2007 , the retail prices index measure of inflation has gone up by 16.6 per cent for the general population – but by 22.2 per cent for those aged 75 and above			2
this is because elderly people do not benefit from the drop in mortgage interest payments , unlike young people , but continue to spend their money on items which are going up , such as food .			0

drop in inflation down to early @entity27 , say experts
food prices have jumped by 4.2 per cent , gas bills by 15.4 per cent and electricity bills by 8.1 per cent
average family will need an extra £ 1,035 to maintain the standard of living they had last year
