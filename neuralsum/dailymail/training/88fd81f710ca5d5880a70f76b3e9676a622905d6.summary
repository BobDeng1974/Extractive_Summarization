the bad news for our supermarkets just keeps coming			0
they have been lining up in recent days to report sales figures ranging from disappointing to near disastrous			2
yesterday , it was @entity7 ' turn to feel the pain , when it announced that its sales in the six weeks to january 4 fell by 3.1 per cent			1
as an indication of just how serious this is for the chain , @entity7 announced 400 job losses and that it will shut ten loss - making stores this year			1
it represents a crippling psychological setback for @entity7 , and underlines how only drastic action can halt , or at least slow , the haemorrhage of shoppers from its stores			1
other big chains dare not gloat , for they are n't much better off			2
last week @entity32 's reported its worst @entity33 for more than a decade with like - for - like sales down 1.7 per cent			1
now , they 're cutting 500 jobs , too			2
this came hot on the heels of an unprecedented poor performance from beleaguered @entity40			1
already reeling from a succession of profit warnings and the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts , it recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent			2
this decline is so significant @entity40 has decided to close 43 loss - making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge @entity40 superstores			1
how are the mighty fallen ! and how rapidly			0
until september 2013 , when @entity40 backtracked on its plans to open a store in @entity54 , @entity55 , after residents ' effective ' no thanks @entity40 ' campaign , the brand was synonymous with aggressive expansion and never - ending , seemingly unstoppable store openings			1
the @entity62 supermarkets have all been struggling with @entity7 , @entity40 and @entity32 's posting dramatic falls in @entity33 sales @entity40 , already reeling from the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts , recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent which has led to a decision by the supermarket to close 43 loss - making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge @entity40 superstores we await results from @entity76 , but given that @entity77 is reporting its spindly 0.1 per cent food sales increase as ' strongly outperforming the market ' , it seems unlikely that @entity76 will have much to raise the prevailing gloom that hangs over the supermarket sector			1
so why do things look so bad ? quite simply , we do n't automatically want to shop in big supermarkets any longer			2
sick of being ripped off by their outrageous prices , we 're abandoning the knee - jerk , one - stop weekly shopping expedition supposed to get us through the week , but which often left us with half a fridge of uneaten food			2
we have become promiscuous customers , shopping around more frequently , buying less at a time , and cherry - picking from various outlets			2
in these straitened economic times we are intently focused , more suspicious than ever , about what we are being asked to pay for food			0
the nation 's supermarket shopping habit has been irretrievably broken by the arrival of the @entity100 - owned discount chains , @entity99 and @entity101			1
it took them more than 20 years ( @entity99 arrived in this country in 1990 and @entity101 in 1994 ) to get their cheaper price message through to us , but we 've definitely got it now			1
budget chains @entity99 ( pictured ) and @entity101 have been blamed for irretrievably changing the nation 's supermarket shopping habits we realise the ' @entity62 ' have been charging us way too much — behaving particularly rapaciously when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables — earning excessive margins and profiteering at our expense			1
last week , for example , i could have paid £ 2.99 per kilogram for cherry tomatoes in @entity32 's , but at @entity101 i 'd have paid only £ 1.78			1
the celery @entity7 wanted 79p for cost 39p at @entity99			1
and this is n't the discounters playing silly , short - term games with prices — unlike their higher - profile rivals			2
it 's these discount chains simply showing what can be done with a different business model and less greedy pricing			2
such spectacular price differences could n't be ignored for ever			0
@entity130 's shoppers have finally woken up and voted with their feet , and their wallets			1
given the hundreds of millions the big supermarket chains have spent on building our trust — through advertising , loyalty cards , phony price wars and deliberately bamboozling promotions — the discovery that , surprise , surprise , they 're not actually on our side has been shattering , and has changed consumers ' habits dramatically			0
these chains all kept telling us how cheap they were , and we believed them			0
what they forgot to tell us was what obscene profits they were making			0
' every little helps , ' said @entity40 , and we never paused to ask : ' helps whom ? ' well , no more			2
any trust we had in them has been lost and may never be restored			0
@entity32 's ( pictured ) reported its worst @entity33 for more than a decade with like - for - like sales down 1.7 per cent it 's not many years since the supermarket each of us so loyally used almost defined who we were — an aspirational @entity32 's family , perhaps , or maybe down - to - earth @entity7 customers			1
it still does , to some extent — in the case of @entity165			0
but by and large , the ties that bound us so tightly to one particular chain have been broken			0
there is more genuine choice and better value to be had elsewhere			0
these days , we shop where we want — at @entity99 one day , at a local butcher or grocer the next and , on those days when we 're simply too tired to care , at whichever chain - owned convenience store we pass on the way home , when we 'll decide what 's for dinner that night			1
mainstream chains still get some of what we spend on food — but not as much			0
many people will be overjoyed by supermarkets finally getting their comeuppance — their aggressive expansion policies , in the @entity186 and out of town , made them bitterly resented			0
on @entity190 , news that @entity40 would shut 43 of its smaller stores was celebrated by those delighted that the destroyer of so many local , independent shops was beginning to suffer itself			1
add the cancelled plans for 49 superstores — the white elephants of today 's food retail world , according to analysts — and what many saw as the ' @entity40 - isation ' of @entity130 finally seems to have gone into reverse			1
they have also announced they are cutting 500 jobs to tackle the poor sales as shoppers turn to cheaper alternatives such as budget chains @entity99 and @entity101 i 'm sure other chains will quietly follow suit , mothballing plans for future store openings			1
and , as with @entity40 and @entity7 , i would n't be surprised to see existing stores shut , too			1
@entity130 's supermarkets may have peaked in their hold over us , but they certainly wo n't vanish altogether , though it would be encouraging to see signs of them learning from past mistakes			0
instead , @entity32 's has done what big chains always do when faced with adversity — announced yet another ' price war ' to try to persuade customers they are getting brilliant deals ( when often they could still buy cheaper elsewhere ) , and place even more economic pressure on its suppliers			1
so what will the future of food shopping in @entity130 look like ? now , the supermarket enchantment spell has been broken , consumers are back in charge			0
if we want to shop at a discounter we will , a trend that may result in a modest expansion of the @entity99 or @entity101 chains : their circumspect @entity100 owners are too canny and conservative for grandiose plans			1
they 'll have seen what over-ambition has done to @entity40 , and learned a lesson			2
other winners will be the assortment of retailers that have emerged in the past few years to meet the demand from consumers for a better shopping experience			0
i 'm talking about traditional street markets , small independent shops , @entity260 and @entity259 grocers , farmers ' markets , vegetable box schemes , farm shops , food co-operatives and a range of online enterprises that have successfully carved out their own niches			0
it 's not nostalgia for times long past			0
but some traditional street markets offer better value than even the discount chains			0
no , i look at today 's food shopping experience and see what works and what does n't			0
and what certainly does n't work as well as it used to is shopping at supermarkets			0
our 40 - year love affair with them is over			0
now , they must pay the price .			0

@entity7 , @entity40 and @entity32 's all posted big falls in @entity33 sales
a total of *900* jobs will be be axed from @entity7 and @entity32 's
@entity40 will close 43 loss - making shops and shelve plans for 49 superstores
thanks to @entity99 and @entity101 shoppers are now turning to cheaper alternatives
