figures showing @entity1 has spectacularly failed to meet his promise to cut immigration will today be ‘ buried ’ under a slew of reports about the @entity7 scandal			1
ministers were last night accused of ‘ cynically ’ timing the release of the @entity11 investigations by two government departments to coincide with the migration statistics			2
both will be released at 9.30am – with reports into the @entity11 ’s paedophile abuse in at least 12 @entity18 hospitals and 21 children ’s homes and schools certain to get blanket coverage			1
immigration figures scheduled for release tomorrow are expected to show that net migration has risen again to more than 260,000 , despite the coalition pledging to cut it to ' tens of thousands ' the publication of the 16 reports from locations around the country will be accompanied by a live press conference			1
the migration statistics will be released without fanfare or a press conference by the independent @entity35			2
they are expected to show that net migration has risen again , to more than 260,000			1
the date has been fixed for months , with spin doctors acutely aware the figures could deliver a serious blow to the prime minister ’s credibility			2
the government is also expected to release 16 reports into @entity7			1
the papers have been ready for months and are already overdue the @entity11 reports could have been released at any time and are already overdue			1
@entity50 officials and mps are convinced the date has been chosen deliberately			0
one said : ‘ it is an open secret that ’s what is going on			0
’ unlike the immigration figures , no blame for the @entity57 affair can be laid at the @entity60 ’s door			2
last night @entity62 deputy leader @entity61 said : ‘ thursday , it is clear , is , for this government , a good day to bury bad news			0
‘ by burying the latest immigration figures under the @entity11 news , they know that the statistics will be masked			0
one just has to wonder what else will be released across @entity50 tomorrow ? ’ mr @entity1 made reducing net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ a key 2010 election promise			1
yet , despite some initial progress , it had reached 260,000 in the year to june 2014			0
experts believe today ’s figures could be even worse – and will leave the @entity78 fighting the election with net migration higher than the 244,000 figure inherited from @entity82			1
last week , the separate @entity83 showed migrant workers were continuing to pour into the @entity85 in huge numbers			0
over 12 months , the number of @entity88 rose by almost 200,000			0
on tuesday , @entity1 appeared to prepare the ground for a humiliating failure			0
he admitted he should cut benefits and tax credits for immigrants more quickly to stop @entity85 being such a ‘ massive draw ’ .			0

figures expected to show another rise in net migration to 260,000
coalition had *previously* pledged to cut number to ' tens of thousands '
data will be *unveiled* at same time as reports in abuse by @entity7
