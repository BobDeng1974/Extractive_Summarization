by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 08:56 est , 17 january 2014 flirting , punting and leapfrogging in the meadows , these carefree students enjoy their last days in the summer sun as the shadows of @entity7 loom larger			1
this poignant video - never before seen in public - shows a bygone age of blissful university life at @entity12 more than 70 years ago			1
shot by a student , the nostalgic scenes include men and women , in the prime of their lives , at play			1
punting in the @entity21 , students did their best to remain carefree and relaxed before many gave their lives for the war effort varsity students captured on video camera in 1941 , a year before they would have been called up for @entity7 @entity27 students enjoying summer in 1941 , before @entity7 call - up but the signs of war are all around with sandbags everywhere , evacuation drills and @entity34 planes in the skies above			1
months after the film was shot by @entity38 student @entity37 , many of the students enlisted - and never lived to see their beloved @entity12 again			1
the grainy images show sunny trips to @entity43 and @entity44 , sporting events such as the 1941 @entity46 , and tennis tournaments at @entity48			2
other snapshots show the @entity34 training to fight the @entity51 as well as the college lawns being dug up to plant vegetables as part of the ' @entity56 ' campaign			1
two of @entity37 's sequences , set to the poignant music @entity60 , show thrill - seeking students , including @entity37 himself , climbing iconic @entity12 buildings in broad daylight			2
@entity37 , who died in 2003 after a career in the chemicals industry , edited the snapshots into a 20 - minute film in 1989 , and added a voiceover			0
his closing remarks reveal his nostalgic fondness for his student years			0
in 1942 , all men between 18 and 51 and all women between 20 and 30 would be called up for service he says : ' what happy days those were , and relatively carefree despite the background of a country at war			1
' @entity79 , archivist at @entity38 , said : ' at one level , the film is an example of how , even though there was a lot of hardship because of the war , many people still tried to make the best of things and live as normal a life as they could			0
‘ what we see in @entity37 's film is the lighter side of college life			1
despite his time at @entity97 's coinciding with the outbreak of war , the sense of there still being time for leisure is evident			0
’ ' at the same time it is also quite poignant , because it was made in 1941 , a year before all male @entity104 subjects between 18 and 51 , and women between 20 and 30 , became eligible for call - up into the armed forces			0
flirting , laughing , and having fun on the home front , as the shadows of war loom large relaxing in the @entity12 daisies , but @entity114 would see many students never return to @entity12 to resume their studies ' although nobody knew it at the time , @entity37 was capturing what was the last months of leisure before many of these people themselves went to war			2
' with hindsight , that makes the film very moving because we can see the signs of war in the background			0
' the film was given to the college following mr @entity37 's death , where it will be preserved for future generations			0
it has now been made available online as part of a wider digitisation project in the archives following a grant from the @entity140			0
carefree days at @entity27 , students were in their last summer days before many of them would be called up for war service although the war started in 1939 , students were not called up until 1942 @entity146 days on the @entity21 , but thoughts of war could never be that far away educated at a grammar school in @entity150 , @entity37 went up to @entity97 ’s to read @entity151 as an undergraduate in 1939 , just as war was breaking out in @entity153			1
part of the film ’s timeless appeal lies in its ordinariness , showing students getting on with academic and social life and having fun despite the planes and signs of wartime			1
despite the archaic fashions and rigid formality of the 1940s , with students wearing suits for punting on the river and being addressed by initials and surnames , the film reveals how little life has changed for many @entity12 students today			1
@entity37 ’s sequences show students including @entity37 himself climbing iconic @entity12 buildings : not under cover of darkness as the infamous ‘ @entity179 of @entity12 ’ did a decade earlier , but in broad daylight			2
time to relax after a hard day 's studying , these pictures were captured on video camera in 1941 @entity186 dressed @entity12 students put thoughts of war behind them , but some would not return such activities were permitted during wartime as part of fire drills and evacuation training			1
in his book @entity198 at @entity199 , author @entity196 described the uncertainty of the early weeks of @entity7 at nearby college @entity199 , saying it was a period of confusion and ambiguity			0
' when war actually broke out , there was an element of relief mingled with horror and apprehension , ' he wrote			0
tea anyone ? dressed in a dapper suit and tie , a blissful image of life at @entity12 at first life continued as normal , with students encouraged to come up to @entity199 's			2
they pursued their studies until they were called up for duty , but behind the routine lurked the spectre of what was to come			0
by 1942 - 43 the university had developed a scheme which allowed men to come up to @entity12 as cadets and study for two terms whilst doing their military training			2
the traditional @entity230 season concerts were maintained , though the 1940 christmas eve broadcast service was accompanied by the drone of aeroplanes during the @entity234 .			0

never before seen video shows bygone age of @entity12 varsity life in 1941
