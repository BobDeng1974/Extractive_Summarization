@entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , filmed his children , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 every day for a year and then used just one second of footage from each day to create a six minute ' time - lapse ' film			1
mr @entity12 , a teacher at @entity38 , said : ' i decided to create this video to show that a single second can take you back to that minute , hour or day			1
' we do n't need to miss out on exciting experiences because we are so desperate to film it all on a mobile			0
' i watched it back after the first month and there was a lot of them in the bath or going to bed and it made me make the effort to come home earlier and spend more quality time with them			0

' mr @entity12 , who lives in @entity77 with wife @entity30 and the triplets ' older brother @entity29 , added : ' even though it 's only one second , you can really start to see how their language and personalities develop			1
