a contraption designed to generate the first breathable air on @entity2 has reached the finals of a global competition to land experiments on the red planet			1
the student - designed device , named @entity9 , could be flown on @entity11 's first unmanned lander mission , and arrive on the surface of @entity2 as early as 2018			1
the @entity9 payload aims to demonstrate a key - life support technology for humans , using electrolysis to produce oxygen from water extracted from @entity2 soil			1
the device will extract water from the @entity2 soil using electrolysis - which is method of using a direct electric current ( @entity29 ) to drive a chemical reaction designed by the @entity31 and @entity11 astronaut candidate , @entity32 , @entity9 is one of ten finalists in the @entity35			1
its main piece of equipment is an electrolysis chamber that works alongside a pressurising mechanism , oxygen sensor and pressure release valve			2
the device extracts water from the @entity2 soil using electrolysis - which is method of using a direct electric current ( @entity29 ) to drive a chemical reaction			1
@entity47 will see the production of hydrogen and oxygen in their elemental state			1
@entity47 will see the production of hydrogen and oxygen in their elemental state			1
the @entity9 , named after the @entity54 heroine who ' breathed life into stone ' , uses electrolysis to produce oxygen from water extracted from @entity2 soil @entity9 will also carry a ' time capsule ' in the form of a radiation - hardened dvd filled with messages and art by the public			1
the project , which is named after the @entity54 heroine who ' breathed life into stone ' , could be the first example of life - support technology on the surface of @entity2			2
it aims to refine technology that will allow humans to survive on the red planet , before the arrival of the @entity11 colonists in 2025			1
' our experiment will hopefully pave the way to ensure the survival of the elected astronauts on the red planet , as we attempt to produce oxygen from @entity2 resources , ' said @entity9 co-lead , @entity86			1
@entity11 is an ambitious plan by a @entity89 entrepreneur to send people to @entity2 next decade and start building a colony there			2
the proposal has received fierce criticism for its lack of realistic goals , and in october one study dealt the team a crushing blow - by saying the colonists will begin dying in 68 days			0
low air pressure , habitats at risk of explosion and a lack of spare parts are among the potentially fatal dangers that apparently await anyone who makes the inaugural trip			0
the damning study was carried out by students at the @entity111			0
in their research they found a number of ‘ failure conditions ’ that would ultimately lead to the demise of the crew			0
‘ the first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission , ' the students write			0
first , the astronauts simply wo n’t have enough food			0
based on @entity11 ’s mission plan , the students say the colonists would ultimately starve on @entity2			1
next , one of the goals of @entity11 is to grow crops in some of the habitats on the red planet			2
but according to the students , this would create huge amounts of oxygen , in turn creating highly flammable environments			0
@entity138 would need to be vented while nitrogen levels would need to be maintained to keep up the air pressure ; however , the technology to do this on another planet has not yet been invented			0
' in addition to the scientific contribution , we are hoping to put together the largest crowd - sourced art collection ever sent to another planet , allowing any @entity151 citizen the opportunity to join us on our trip to @entity2 , and leave their legacy in truly ' out of this world ' style			0
' other entries include ' @entity159 ' , a @entity161 project that is aiming to change a small amount of the 95 per cent carbon dioxide @entity2 atmosphere into oxygen using cyanobacteria			2
another entry from the @entity168 will see a small greenhouse built on the red planet to attempt to grow lettuce for astronauts in a pressurised environment			0
the researchers also point out that even getting all the necessary equipment to @entity2 ( shown ) will require 15 launches of @entity178 ’s upcoming super-rocket , the @entity179 , at a cost of £ 2.8 billion ( $ 4.5 billion )			0
‘ the first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission , ' the students write			0

the device has been designed by the @entity31
it is in a global contest be flown on @entity11 's first unmanned lander
the device will extract water from the @entity2 soil using electrolysis
it will see production of hydrogen and oxygen in their elemental state
@entity9 aims to prove process before arrival of @entity11 colonists in 2025
