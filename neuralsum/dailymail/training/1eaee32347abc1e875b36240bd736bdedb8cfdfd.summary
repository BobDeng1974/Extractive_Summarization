by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:22 est , 25 february 2014 two @entity4 police sources have said they would not miss @entity5 should he move to @entity6 @entity4 police sources have reportedly said @entity5 will not be missed should he move to @entity6			1
the actor revealed yesterday in @entity9 that he ‘ probably ’ needs to move out of the city and said he was considering @entity6 @entity5 said he misses the days when @entity4 would signal their appreciation of celebrities briefly and politely while taking care to maintain privacy			1
an @entity16 police officer responded however by telling the @entity17 : ‘ i say : do n’t let the door hit you on the way out of the city			1
’ the officer , who has not been named , reportedly knows @entity5 from the actor ’s neighbourhood , @entity25			1
‘ i do n’t like the guy			2
it ’s a pain in the ass to deal with him every time he blows his top at the press and we ’re called in to clean up the mess			2
’ the source said that mr @entity5 shows ‘ respect ’ to police officers , but said he was n’t sure if it was ‘ sincere ’ or not			1
another police source also told the paper : ‘ good riddance			2
’ they also said that his life would not get any better if he moves to @entity6 , pointing out that the press would ' hound ' him there as well			1
in the @entity4 interview , headlined ' @entity46 ' , he talks about beginning to ‘ crave ’ @entity6 after more than 30 years in the @entity47 because he thinks he would be able to give wife @entity48 and their six - month - old daughter @entity49 a more peaceful and private life			1
' i give up ' : melodramatic @entity5 laments his a-list life as he predicts he will ' probably ' have to leave @entity4 in candid new interview revealing : the interview is said to detail the former 30 @entity57 's feud with fellow actor @entity58 and the dispute with @entity60 that ended his short - lived up late talk show in the same interview , mr @entity5 also claims @entity58 verbally attacked him while making orphans , leading to their bust - up			1
the 55 - year - old star and mr @entity58 were engulfed in a feud after clashing while making the @entity67 play partly because he claims the @entity69 actor ' began to sulk ' because mr @entity5 did n't learn his lines ahead of rehearsals			1
he said : ' one day he attacked me in front of everyone			2
he said , “ you ’re slowing me down , and you do n’t know your lines			2
and if you do n’t say your lines , i ’m just going to keep saying my lines			2
” ' we all sat , frozen			0
i snorted a bit , and , turning to him in front of the whole cast , i asked , “ if i do n’t say my words fast enough , you ’re going to just say your next line ? ” i said			0
“ you realise the lines are written in a certain order ? ” he just glared at me			0
' mr @entity5 claims he asked for a break to cut short the incident and went to speak to the stage manager with director @entity91 and offered to quit the project and insisted they did n't fire mr @entity58			1
but the actor recalls mr @entity58 , who he had heard was ' potentially very difficult to work with ' , was ' shocked ' when he was given his marching orders from the show			1
love - hate relationship : the volatile star has long lamented the intrusion into his private life and several homophobic rants have notably affected his career , with his short - lived up late talk show cancelled in november following an anti-gay slur at a photographer elsewhere in the article , which features an accompanying close - up of mr @entity5 as he stares into the camera with a neutral , if a little sour , expression on his face , the oscar - nominee discusses his feelings about @entity60 , on which he had short - lived talk show up late			1
the programme was pulled off air for good in november after five episodes following what was initially a two - week suspension , reportedly due to mr @entity5 's use of yet another anti-gay slur during an altercation with a photographer outside his home			1
while the official word was that the two parted ways mutually , sources say the star 's ' diva - like behaviour towards co-workers ' , along with the homophobic comment , played a deciding factor in the decision			2
but in his @entity9 chat , he insists he ' never wanted ' to be on @entity60 in the first place and describes it as ' the same s * * t all day long ' as well as slamming several stars of the channel including talk show host @entity139			0
speaking about the channel , he said : ' @entity142 was boring			0
@entity143 is neither eloquent nor funny			0
and merely cranky does n’t always work well in the morning			0
@entity144 is the @entity145 of cable news			0
i liked @entity147 a lot			0
i like @entity149 , but he ’s too smart to be doing that show			0
@entity151 is @entity151 , the ultimate wonk / dweeb who got a show , polished it , made it her own			0
the problem with everybody on @entity60 is none of them are funny , although that does n’t prevent them from trying to be			0
' however , ms @entity151 - who he described as ' phony who does n't have the same passion for truth off - camera that she seems to have on air - seems to have dismissed his claims , highlighting that they have never even met			0
she tweeted : ' i have never met mr. @entity5 , either on - camera or off - camera			1
i wish him all the best			0
' around the same time the @entity175 talk show was pulled , @entity5 lamented the invasion of privacy he and his family faces on a daily basis , ranting in an open letter on the @entity181 that he was willing to give it all up to protect his loved ones			1
' if quitting the television business , the movie business , the theater , any component of entertainment , is necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family , then that is an easy choice , ' he wrote			0
' this country ’s obsession with the private lives of famous people is tragic			0
' ' it is an easy choice ' : in november , the former @entity201 actor said it was a no - brainer that he would give up his career for the sake of protecting his family - pictured here with wife @entity206 and six - month - old daughter @entity49 in @entity207 earlier this month			2

two @entity4 police sources say the actor will not be missed should he move to @entity6
mr @entity5 said in an interview , published yesterday , that he ' probably ' needs to move out of the city and that he was considering @entity6
