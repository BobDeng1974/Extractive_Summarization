ordeal : mp @entity1 was left in a cupboard then in a corridor at @entity4 when he arrived with a ruptured appendix at 5.30am an mp who suffered a ruptured appendix has told how he could have died after being left to wait for more than 12 hours on a trolley in a ‘ chaotic ’ a&e department			1
@entity1 had expected the emergency department at @entity4 in @entity10 , @entity11 , to be quiet when he was taken there in agony at 5.30am			1
instead , he found patients crammed into every corner – and beleaguered staff ‘ run ragged ’			1
in a disturbing account , mr @entity1 , conservative mp for nearby @entity18 , described how : critics claim @entity21 has struggled to cope since the department at @entity23 in neighbouring @entity18 was closed last winter			1
and last week an official report concluded there had been an ‘ underestimate of the resources ’ needed to maintain standards , while nurses ’ workloads had ‘ increased significantly ’			1
mr @entity1 , 45 , said : ‘ i now realise i could have died waiting so long to get my scan and operation			1
‘ the place was jam - packed			0
every cubicle was taken and trolleys lined the corridors			2
in between , people well enough to sit up were on chairs			0
if this is what it ’s like at the height of summer , how bad could it be in the depths of winter ? ’ mr @entity1 was taken to @entity44 by ambulance at 5.30am on june 2 , after collapsing in agony			1
at 7am , a doctor assured him he would get a ct scan within ‘ a couple of hours ’			1
he said : ‘ for six hours my wife , mother , and a friend were being told “ yes , yes , yes – he will be seen			1
” but they were being fobbed off			0
they found out i had not been booked in for a scan on the system			1
‘ in the meantime , i was on a trolley , in an @entity44 cubicle that doubled as a storeroom , curled up in pain			1
‘ they were very concerned and apologised for me being missed from the @entity71 booking system			0
’ but after finally being taken for a scan at 5.30pm , mr @entity1 had to wait another seven hours in an @entity44 corridor for a diagnosis – because all the doctors able to interpret the results were in theatre			1
he finally went into theatre at 2pm the next day – almost 33 hours after arriving by ambulance			1
the mp , a father of six , said : ‘ they discovered i had a perforated , gangrenous appendix			1
thankfully they got to it and the resulting infection in time , before it became life - threatening			2
it could have been very serious			0
people die of appendicitis and time is crucial			0
closed : nurses have been put under strain after the @entity44 at nearby @entity23 was closed in january ‘ i waited nine to ten hours longer than i should have done for the scan			1
if it was not for my family and friend acting as my advocates , i fear i would have been completely lost in the system			0
‘ i fear for other patients , who may well be disorientated and vulnerable , and , without their own advocate , become helpless and voiceless			0
‘ i know the hospital was almost certainly trying to do its best			0
but when you have an @entity44 bursting at the seams , you ca n’t give everyone the best care			0
the reality i saw was that on an ordinary day in june my local @entity44 could not cope			0
’ in 2007 , @entity109 joined mr @entity1 in opposing the closure of @entity44 and was pictured with him outside the hospital			2
but after coming to power , mr @entity109 ’s first health secretary , @entity113 , approved the closure			0
hospital inspectors from the @entity117 coincidentally arrived the day after mr @entity1 ’ @entity44 ordeal			2
in their report , published last week , they calculated that 189,000 patients would use the @entity44 this year – 39,000 more than before the @entity23 department was downgraded to an @entity122 in december			2
health bosses had forecast only 26,000 extra patients would end up at @entity125 annually			0
strain : mr @entity1 described beleaguered staff ' run ragged ' at @entity4 the report also found managers were ‘ firefighting ’ as the hospital was ‘ stretched ’			1
yet two more a&es in the area are to close next month			0
the rationale is that concentrating emergency services in fewer places will be better for patients , in part because it will be easier to staff them properly around the clock			0
a spokesman for @entity142 said mr @entity1 ’ stay had coincided with a period of exceptional demand , but denied patients were at risk			2
he said : ‘ our @entity44 department is one of the busiest in @entity11 , on some days seeing as many as 600 patients			2
' during the three days in early june when @entity1 was a patient with us , there were exceptional challenges which resulted in delays in @entity44 treatment			2
‘ we have apologised to @entity1 for the time it took to confirm his complex diagnosis and to get him to the operating theatre			1
it took longer than usual , but he was safe throughout , although we do recognise he experienced considerable discomfort			0
‘ we strongly reject his suggestion that patients who do n’t have someone to speak up for them are at risk			0
when a patient is alone , our doctors and nurses are particularly vigilant and also carry out hourly checks			0

@entity1 , @entity18 mp , suffered ruptured appendix
taken to @entity4 in nearby north @entity11 at 5.30am
took 12 hours to get ct scan as staff forgot to enter him on the system
was *n't* diagnosed for another 7 hours , first put in cupboard then corridor
comes as report concludes resources have been put under severe stain
it took 12 hours to get a ct scan – because *overworked* staff forgot to enter his details on the system ;
it took a further seven hours for him to be diagnosed – while all the time a deadly infection could have been *spreading* through his body ;
he was first put in a cubicle that doubled as a store cupboard – and then a *crowded* corridor .
