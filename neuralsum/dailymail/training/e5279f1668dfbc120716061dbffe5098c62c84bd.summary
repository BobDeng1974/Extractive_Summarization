by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 11 september 2013 @entity2 students have been banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security			2
teenagers at @entity8 have been told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are ' easily identifiable at all times '			1
but while some students welcomed the move , arguing it keeps them safer , others called it ' disgusting '			1
two @entity2 students at the @entity8 campus in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the college have banned @entity2 girls from wearing a veil			2
eyes , nose and mouth all have to be visible controversial policy : staff at @entity8 , pictured , have said the guidelines are in place for ' security reasons ' the ban of the niqab , a veil which leaves a thin slot for the eyes , has caused some female students enroll at different college			1
news of the policy , which also requires students to remove hats and hoodies , was broken to those who were starting at the college last week			1
student @entity46 , 17 , said her ' freedom had been breached ' by the rule			1
outrage : @entity46 , 17 , believes the ban on veils is a breach of her freedom - this veil is not allowed because it covers all , but @entity46 's eyes ' me and another friend who wears the veil were only told we would n’t be allowed inside the college after we had enrolled , ' she said			1
' they have n’t provided us with another alternative			2
we said we would happily show the men at security our faces so they could check them against our ids , but they wo n’t let us			2
' it ’s a breach of my freedom and i feel discriminated against			2
' this is my religion , it is what i believe in			2
' i do n’t really want to go to a place that does n’t accept me but i have no choice now			2
' another 17 - year - old girl , who did not want to be named , was so upset at the policy that has she decided to look for another college place in the city			1
she said : ' it ’s disgusting			1
' it is a personal choice and i find it absolutely shocking that this has been brought in at a college in @entity80 when the city is so multicultural and so many of the students are @entity2			2
' it upsets me that we are being discriminated against			0
' i do n’t think my niqab prevents me from studying or communicating with anyone			0
' i ’ve never had any problems in the city before			0
' @entity90 , 17 , is taking @entity92 science at the college and strongly disagreed with the guidelines			1
safety : @entity96 , mp for @entity97 , left , refuses to see constituents who do not lift their veil while @entity100 , 18 , a business student , right , said the veil ban was ' good for security ' he said : ' they ’re not going to bring a bomb to college			1
they have come here to learn			0
' the strict policy was announced days after the issue of wearing religious dress was brought up in parliament			0
@entity97 mp @entity96 , who refuses to see constituents who will not lift their veils , raised the issue in a @entity114 , saying it ' goes against the basic part of the @entity118 way of life '			0
principal and chief executive of the college			0
dame @entity123 , defended the policy , saying it had been in place for some time and had been developed to keep students safe			0
she said : ' we have a very robust equality , @entity130 at @entity8 but we are committed to ensuring that students are provided with a safe and welcoming learning environment whilst studying with us			1
' to ensure that safeguarding is a priority , we have developed our policy alongside student views to ensure we keep them safe			0
' this needs individuals to be easily identifiable at all times when they are on college premises and this includes the removal of hoodies , hats , caps and veils so that faces are visible			1
' all prospective and progressing students , as well as staff , have been advised of the policy , which will mean everyone allowed on the premises can understand and know each other in a safe environment			1
' president of the @entity158 , @entity159 , said the women at the college should accept the policy and abide by the rules ' some feel it is part of their religion but they need to be practical , ' he said			0
' if you go to a bank riding a motorbike , you are required to take your helmet off and identify yourself			0
' and when it comes to sitting exams there is also an issue surrounding identification , because the college needs to know who is sitting the paper			0
' some feel it goes against their freedom of expression , but they should abide by the rules that are part of society			0
' a @entity2 woman near the entrance of @entity8 , where face - covering veils have been banned - a veil covering all but eyes is deemed unacceptable other students at the college , which has several campuses across the @entity20 , said the ban makes them feel safer			1
@entity195 , 17 , who is studying business , said : ' you do n’t know who is underneath it			1
' you ca n’t see any of their face - only their eyes			1
' lieve it is good for security			0
you ca n’t see their face and it is hard to communicate with them			0
' @entity211 , 17 , also studies business			1
he said : ' the rule is alright if it is for security reasons			0
they are n’t being asked to show off their body parts			0
' two weeks ago , a judge told a @entity2 woman she had to remove her burkha in court before she could enter a plea			2
the 21 - year - old woman refused to reveal her face because there were men in the room and it was against her religious beliefs			1
judge @entity230 said the principle of open justice overrode her beliefs , and warned there was a risk a different person could go into the dock pretending to be her			0
case by case : schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases			2
in a key 2007 case , a high court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class			0
although the 12 - year - old ’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in @entity260 , teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her			1
they said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention , engaged with her work or distressed			0
after the case , the government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full - face veils on grounds of security , safety or learning			1
it said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils			0
schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders , it added			0
but rather than a @entity289 - style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces , the @entity287 said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation			2
updated government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face - coverings			1
it says it is ‘ still lawful ’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘ health , safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others ’			2
and religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘ at any time , in any place , or in any particular manner , ’ the guidance adds .			0

@entity8 forces teenagers to remove items
staff say it is for safety and ensures *people* are ' identifiable at all times '
guidelines have divided opinion , with one 17 - year - old calling it ' disgusting '
