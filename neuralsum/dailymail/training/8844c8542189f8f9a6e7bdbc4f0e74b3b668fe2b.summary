a strange volcano - like building spews water instead of lava ; its welcoming windows adorned with moss and vines , complementing the surrounding trees			1
it looks like the kind of place the blue folk from @entity12 might hook up with hobbits and @entity14 to go on holiday			1
but this is neither @entity17 , @entity18 nor the @entity20 forest moon of @entity21			2
deep in southern @entity23 lies the @entity24 - an extraordinary hotel hidden away in the centre of a 300,000 - acre private nature reserve			1
the ' @entity50 ' retreat , in @entity41 , is accessible only by foot and intrepid guests must brave a swinging rope bridge to enter it			2
among the activities on offer are a wild - course mini-golf , where the holes form part of the natural terrain , hiking and access to the longest zip wire in @entity63 , which run through the grounds at a height of 1,500ft			0
and , if you 're lucky , you might catch a glimpse of a pudu - the world 's smallest deer which is just 13in tall			0
at the end of the day , guests can relax in hot tubs carved from gigantic tree trunks - as the calming sound from the waterfall cascades down the side of the building			0
prices at the rainforest hotel - which lies in the grounds of the @entity40 @entity80 biosphere reserve - range from £ 150 to £ 260 per night			1
the ' @entity50 ' retreat is accessible only by foot and intrepid guests must brave a swinging rope bridge to enter it they would feel right at home ( l to r ) : @entity86 , an @entity14 from @entity20 and a character from @entity12 would all probably love to spend some time at the hotel			0

@entity24 lodge lies deep in southern @entity23 on @entity80 nature reserve
