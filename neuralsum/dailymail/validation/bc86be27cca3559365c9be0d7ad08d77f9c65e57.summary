girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour – not for their ability – according to a major study girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour – not for their ability – according to a major study			1
and this is making life more difficult for them when they enter the jobs market , where rewards are primarily based on what they know , says the @entity18			1
it said girls are much more likely than boys to be model pupils			2
their diligence and obedience in the classroom is often ‘ rewarded ’ with higher marks , while many boys are ‘ punished ’ with poor marks for being disruptive			0
it may mean marks reflect good or bad attitudes to studying , but not necessarily aptitude			2
the @entity18 warned that girls who may do better in the short run at school could be ‘ penalised ’ in the labour market later on			1
it called on teachers to review their own ‘ gender biases ’ and consider whether marking girls up was really helping them			0
@entity41 , the @entity18 ’s director for education and skills , said that even when girls and boys do similarly well in reading and maths tests , girls get better marks			1
teenagers with a strong belief in their abilities are more likely to be successful in @entity54 than in any other country , the study also showed			0
those youngsters who were self confident scored higher in maths and science tests , according to analysis by the @entity18			1
and although the pattern is replicated across the world , the effect is more marked in the @entity54 compared to any other country			0
meanwhile the research also showed that even though girls outperform boys overall in schools , they are still lagging behing when it comes to maths and science			0
the report warned : ' what emerges from these anayses is particularly worrying			0
' even many high - achieving girls have low levels of confidnece in their ability to solve science and mathematics problems and express high levels of anxiety towards mathematics			0
' ‘ maybe in the short run , you get a better school certificate , ’ he said			0
‘ in the long run , the world is going to penalise you because the labour market does n’t pay you for your school marks , it pays you for what you can do			1
’ teachers consistently give better results to girls than boys , even when they perform similarly in the international @entity98 tests , which are run by the @entity18			1
the study , based on data from tests taken by 15 - year - olds in maths , reading and science , looked at gender differences in education			2
it said : ‘ girls ’ better marks may reflect that they tend to be “ better students ” than boys : they tend to do what is expected of them , thanks to better self - regulation skills , and they are more driven to excel in school			2
’ children who play computer games regularly do better than their peers at school , the @entity18 research also suggests			1
it found that those who played one - player games in moderation performed better in core subjects than those who never played			0
it said many games ‘ incorporate good learning principles ’ and ‘ hone problem - solving skills ’			0
girls who may do better in the short run at school could be ‘ penalised ’ in the labour market later on , a study has found ( file picture )			1

girls are being over-praised at school for their good behaviour , study finds
but this is making life harder for them when they enter the jobs market
