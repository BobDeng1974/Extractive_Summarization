by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 09:37 est , 22 april 2013 the discovery of the 4,400 - year - old burial site of a woman adorned with gold jewellery has prompted speculation that @entity7 's royal connection goes back further than suspected			1
archaeologists working in a quarry near the royal family 's @entity11 residence have unearthed a rare @entity14 grave of a middle - aged woman buried with some of @entity17 's oldest gold ornaments			1
the find is doubly significant since grave sites from the era containing such fine jewellery , which also included lignite and amber , are usually associated with men			0
the first queen of @entity7 ? this computer - generated image imagines how the @entity14 woman found buried near the royals ' @entity29 residence may have looked wearing her gold , amber and lignite finery in life ' it is interesting to think who this woman was within her community , ' said site director @entity39 of @entity40 , who has worked on the site for the past seven years			1
' she was probably an important person in her society , perhaps holding some standing which gave her access to prestigious , rare and exotic items			0
' she could have been a leader , a person with power and authority , or possibly part of an elite family - perhaps a princess or queen			2
' the @entity53 that stands to this day was begun by @entity54 in the decade following the 1066 @entity56 , which overthrew the @entity59 kings who had previously ruled @entity60			0
he established the site as part of a ring of forts around @entity65 intended to cement his new position of power and guard against potential usurpers			0
@entity71 burial : she as found with a large pottery drinking vessel , dating her to communities which lived across @entity74 at around 2,500 bc but experts believe the recently unearthed woman was interred much , much earlier			0
they estimate that she was buried between 2,200 and @entity77 - just a century or two after the construction of @entity79			1
that stone - circle , which many believe had mystical significance to early @entity17 , is located just 60 miles to the south - west			2
she was found with a large pottery drinking vessel , which archaeologists term a ' beaker ' , dating her to communities which lived across @entity74 at around 2,500 bc. in more westerly regions like @entity17 these beaker - using communities were the first to use copper and gold			1
at the time of the woman 's burial , she wore a necklace containing small tubular sheet gold beads and black disc beads of lignite - a material similar to jet			2
a number of larger perforated amber buttons were also found in a row along her body , indicating that she may have been wearing clothing , perhaps of woven wool , at the time of her burial			0
further lignite beads from near her hands suggest that she also wore a bracelet			0
the @entity116 flies from @entity53 : the castle that stands to this day was begun by @entity54 in the decade following the 1066 @entity56 as part of a ring of forts surrounding @entity65 @entity79 , @entity121 : scientists estimate the woman was buried just a century or two after @entity79 was completed			1
the mystical site is located ust 60 miles to the south - west of the quarry where she was found dr @entity127 , an expert in @entity14 metalwork , who studying the gold beads said : ' beaker graves of this date are almost unknown in @entity132 and only a small number of them , and indeed continental @entity74 , contain gold ornaments			1
' the tubular beads that were found at @entity137 are certainly rare in @entity17 , and this gives the grave tremendous research importance			2
' lead isotype analysis has been used to determine that the gold used in the jewellery most probably came from deposits located in south - east @entity144 and southern @entity17			1
the lignite beads used in the necklace are believed to have come from the east of @entity60 , while the amber may have come from as far away as the @entity149			0
scientists hope further analyses will shed light on the patterns of gold procurement and the extent of trading networks in prehistoric @entity17			1
rare find : lead isotype analysis has been used to determine that the gold used in the jewellery most probably came from deposits located in south - east @entity144 and southern @entity17 osteologist @entity160 examined the skeletal remains			1
she said they appear to be those of an adult aged 35 or over , possibly female			0
she admitted however that the high acidity of the soil around the grave had led to the degradation of the the bones and collagen precludes the possibility of radiocarbon dating and dna analysis			0
beaker burials of this type are rare in this region of @entity60 and , it was an unexpected find , the researchers said			0
the @entity137 site : experts say there is an ' extensive prehistoric landscape ' buried beneath the quarry and surrounding areas on the edge of @entity65 and @entity29 this map shows the relative locations of the archaeological site at @entity137 , @entity53 and @entity79 , which was completed just a century or two before the woman was buried with her jewellery however , as dr @entity193 of @entity40 noted , ' we know from recent research that an extensive prehistoric landscape is buried beneath the edge of @entity65 and @entity29			1
' the @entity137 project is currently adding much new and significant information to this unfolding story and challenging our perception and understanding of prehistory			0
' the beads will go on display at the end of april at a special two day event organised by @entity40 and @entity206 @entity17 , the cement firm which owns the @entity137 site where they were unearthed .			2

@entity211 ' princess or queen ' dug up near to the royals ' @entity11 residence
