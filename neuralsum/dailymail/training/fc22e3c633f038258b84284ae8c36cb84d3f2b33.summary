by @entity0 published : 20:46 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 16 january 2013 a beauty cream ad promising to give women the same body as @entity4 has been banned for being misleading			2
@entity5 failed to convince experts at the @entity7 that its anti-cellulite product could really deliver the promised effect			1
the email advertisement for a body sculpture cream was headlined ‘ get a body to die for with 50 % off body sculpture for 24 hours ’			0
@entity4 as she appears in a photoshoot for @entity16 - the image has been used in an advert that the @entity7 says is misleading it featured an image of the 29 - year - old actress , who starred in the 2010 film @entity21 , in her underwear and linked this to an @entity16 feature where she was described as ‘ the sexiest woman alive ’			1
the ad went on : ‘ get @entity4 ’ @entity16 look with this intensive formula that helps reduce the appearance of cellulite fast ’			1
potential customers were urged to ‘ streamline your bum , thighs & tummy with this a-list must have ! ’			0
@entity37 ’s website says its products are the skincare choice for @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
defending its claims for the body sculpture cream , which costs £ 75 for 200ml , @entity5 said it includes bio-marine actives , wheat protein and caffeine ‘ to help break down stubborn fat and promote drainage and reduce fluid retention in the body ’			1
it also said the gel is ‘ infused with pomegranate tannins to firm and tone your skin and boost collagen production ’ , which is associated with young skin			0
misleading : the advert featuring @entity4 sent by @entity5 as an email to potential customers the @entity7 said : ‘ most consumers would understand that the claim ‘ ‘ streamline your bum , thighs & tummy with this a-list must have ! ’ ’ implied that consumers who used the product would be able to reduce the appearance of cellulite and tighten and smooth their bottom , thighs and tummy			1
‘ evidence presented consisted of information about two active ingredients within the body sculpture product which made reference to in vivo trials on those ingredients			0
however , the trials themselves were not supplied			0
because robust evidence was not presented to demonstrate the implied efficacy claims for the product or that @entity4 had achieved the look featured in the photo as a result of using the product , we concluded that the ad was misleading			2
’ the @entity7 said it should not be repeated .			2

@entity93 promised @entity4 ' look with its ' intensive formula '
200ml costs £ 75 - but failed to convince @entity7 of its anti-cellulite *properties*
