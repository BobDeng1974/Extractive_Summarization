struggle : @entity45 said her husband , @entity12 , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead reliving the fraught decision in her book , she wrote : ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... if i ca n’t have one , i must have the other '			1
under the terms of her new deal , @entity5 took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests			1
