the biggest ever foreign takeover of a @entity2 company is on the cards after @entity5 drugs giant @entity4 revealed it was preparing a £ 60billion bid for @entity7			1
@entity8 - based @entity7 , which produces drugs combating diabetes , high cholesterol and cancer for millions of patients , has already rejected two offers from the maker of @entity16 this year , saying they ‘ very significantly undervalued @entity7 and its prospects ’			1
and yesterday , @entity4 ’s chief executive @entity19 admitted that if its takeover bid was successful there are no guarantees that thousands of manufacturing jobs at @entity7 will remain in the @entity2			1
overtures : @entity4 has admitted making two multi- 0billion pound approaches for @entity2 rival @entity26 the firm is one of the largest in @entity2 and one of the world ’s biggest pharmaceutical companies			1
it has eight factories in the @entity2 and has expanded across the globe to sell billions of pounds worth of its products in more than 100 countries			2
if the deal goes ahead it will be the latest in a long line of @entity2 firms to have fallen prey to foreign takeovers , including @entity43 and @entity44 the chemist			1
a merger would create the world ’s biggest pharmaceuticals firm , worth £ 150billion			2
@entity4 , whose best - known drug is erectile dysfunction treatment @entity16 , decided to go public about its takeover intentions after @entity7 ‘ declined to engage ’ in full - blown merger talks			1
however , the @entity54 trade union claimed a deal would see the @entity5 giant shift @entity2 - based jobs to the @entity58			1
a spokesman said : ‘ this is not good news			0
’ in 2011 , @entity4 closed its main research plant in @entity63 , @entity64 , with the loss of 2,400 jobs			2
@entity4 now has 28 days to either table a firm offer or walk away			1
once it has made an official bid , @entity7 would need to seek approval from its shareholders			1
business secretary @entity72 said : ‘ my priority is ensuring there are high - skilled jobs and long - term investment in research and development in the @entity2			2
the chief executive of @entity4 has informed me of his intentions , and i have emphasised the importance of these points			2
’ by @entity83 if ever there was a moment to be fearful for @entity2 ’s future as an advanced science - based manufacturing economy it is now			1
the @entity5 bid for @entity7 is not only the biggest attempted foreign takeover in @entity2 history , but is a direct assault on high - quality and skilled @entity2 jobs			1
the predator , @entity5 drugs giant @entity4 , makes no secret of the reasons why it has cynically targeted the rival @entity2 firm			1
it is because it fears it is running out of ideas for new drug compounds in its own laboratories and also wants the tax advantages of moving its hq to the @entity2			2
@entity107 deal : the deal for @entity7 would be the biggest - ever foreign takeover of a @entity2 business but if the takeover deal goes ahead , it would have a devastating effect on @entity2 ’s status as home to some of the world ’s most respected brands			1
since @entity4 shares are quoted in @entity120 , with its main markets in the @entity5 and most investors based there , the promise to move to @entity2 is no more than a ploy to cut taxes and to browbeat @entity7 investors into submission and to gull our weak politicians into approving the deal			1
the challenge is a huge test for chancellor @entity133			0
for only last month he boasted he wanted to create ‘ new centres for doctoral training and for cell therapy ’ in @entity2			0
indeed , these are areas where @entity7 is a world leader			0
but mr @entity133 ’s patriotism has been questioned			0
rather than jumping to the defence of one of the nation ’s most successful industries , he seems to have sold the pass , saying that any deal would be ‘ a commercial matter between the two companies ’			0
compare this spineless stance with that of the @entity151 government , which in recent days has expressed ‘ patriotic concern ’ amid talk that the @entity5 conglomerate @entity153 has bid for its @entity151 rival @entity154 ’s energy business			0
sadly , such a failure to support one of the @entity2 ’s key industries fits a depressing pattern that has been the shameful mark of both @entity161 - led and @entity163 governments , which have allowed a long list of @entity2 companies to fall under overseas ownership			2
most recently , ministers watched as @entity43 ran up the white flag in the face of the greater financial muscle of @entity5 food giant @entity171			0
before that , we sold the @entity2 airports operator @entity174 to @entity176 group @entity175 , and control of our ports passed from @entity179 into foreign hands			2
and most of our power utilities have been sold to continental giants such as @entity184 of @entity151			0
to compound matters , we have even entrusted state - controlled @entity184 to build our next generation of nuclear power stations with questionable @entity189 government money			0
overtures : @entity4 has admitted making two multi- 0billion pound approaches for @entity2 rival @entity26 as for @entity7 and the rest of the @entity2 pharmaceutical industry , their importance to our current and future economy can not be over-estimated			1
this one firm contributes 3 per cent to national output and together with other drug companies ( including its bigger rival @entity200 ) contributes 10 per cent to national output			0
when a @entity203 academic looked at the sectors of the @entity2 economy which hold key competitive advantages over other @entity208 nations , pharmaceuticals and aerospace ( along with the currently disgraced financial services sector ) came out on top			0
what ’s more , @entity4 has a less than honourable record in @entity2			1
in 2011 , its bosses closed its only research and development facility in the @entity2 with the loss of 2,400 research and laboratory jobs			0
contrast this with our own drugs industry ’s universally admired record of developing new products			0
@entity7 is planning to spend £ 350million on a centre at a science park based at @entity227 and is developing new treatments for cancer and respiratory disorders			1
@entity133 may be reluctant to speak up now in support of @entity7 but has , in the past , shown that he recognises how crucial it is to invest in such areas – having offered tax incentives that have had a hugely positive impact on the attractiveness of the @entity2 as a centre for pioneering research			1
this persuaded @entity200 to bring back to @entity2 £ 1billion of investment from labs around the world			2
moreover , we should not forget that @entity7 , despite its concocted name , is a company with deep @entity2 roots – once part of world - famous @entity248 that , with the genius of @entity252 - born sir @entity251 , was created in the 1920s			1
if only our politicians had learnt the lessons of history and been alert to the warning signs of allowing @entity2 treasure to be flogged to foreigners			0
for , i fear , we are witnessing a repeat of the @entity43 scandal			0
@entity4 has promised investors in @entity7 that the @entity2 would be the centre of its research activity , but as @entity43 ’s buyer @entity171 showed , the record of @entity5 companies making promises to @entity2 shareholders and politicians is pretty disreputable			1
@entity171 pledged to keep open the @entity43 plant near @entity272 , but then closed it just weeks after the takeover , moving manufacturing to @entity274			0
it also promised not to cut jobs at @entity277 , @entity43 ’s spiritual home , but then proceeded to do so			0
@entity4 , like @entity171 , is a company known for buying rivals , cutting costs and absorbing the best parts of the business and then selling off the rest			2
that is why @entity7 should be protected			0
for too long , our governments have sat idly by as foreign companies have scooped up great swathes of our industrial infrastructure and raided hi - tech companies for their patents			0
no other nation would countenance the idea of one of its greatest companies falling into overseas hands in a deal that would be bad for jobs , bad for science , bad for @entity2 taxpayers – who , over the years , have invested in the training of these firms ’ great brains – and , above all , bad for @entity2 .			0

@entity8 - based @entity7 has rejected two offers from @entity4 already
@entity308 company significantly undervalued @entity7 and its prospects
another £ 60billion bid is believed to be on the cards
will be latest @entity2 firm to be taken over by a foreign company
