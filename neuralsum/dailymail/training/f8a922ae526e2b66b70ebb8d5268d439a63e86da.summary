revelations : in a bombshell email to the @entity3 sir @entity2 threatened to reveal new details behind the ' dodgy dossier ' scandal a former head of @entity8 has threatened to reveal explosive new details behind the ‘ dodgy dossier ’ scandal if he objects to the long - awaited findings of the @entity12 into @entity14 ’s role in the @entity15			1
sir @entity2 , 68 , who provided intelligence about @entity18 ’s @entity17 ( @entity17 ) that was apparently ‘ sexed up ’ by @entity21 ’s @entity20 , has spent the last year writing a detailed account of events leading up to the war			1
he had intended to keep his work under lock and key and made available only to historians after his death			2
but now sir @entity2 has revealed to @entity31 that he could go public after the @entity12 publishes its findings			1
sir @entity2 is expected to face censure from the inquiry ’s chairman , sir @entity34 , over the accuracy of intelligence provided by @entity8 agents inside @entity39 – which was used in the so - called ‘ dodgy dossier ’			1
in a bombshell email to the @entity31 , sir @entity2 , who is master at @entity44 , @entity45 , disclosed : ‘ what i have written ( am writing ) is a record of events surrounding the invasion of @entity39 from my then professional perspective			1
‘ my intention is that this should be a resource available to scholars , but after my decease ( may be sooner depending on what @entity57 publishes )			0
i have no intention , however , of violating my vows of official secrecy by publishing any memoir			0
’ sources close to sir @entity2 say that while he accepts that some of @entity8 ’s information on the @entity17 was inaccurate , he insists that @entity57 should recognise the role played by @entity21 and the prime minister ’s chief spokesman @entity64 in informing media reports which suggested @entity18 could use chemical weapons to target @entity14 troops based in @entity69 – a claim which put @entity14 on a path to war in @entity39			1
mr @entity21 and mr @entity64 have repeatedly denied making misleading statements about @entity17			2
but sir @entity2 is said to remain extremely aggrieved that this piece of intelligence , which his agents stressed only referred to battlefield munitions which had a much shorter range , led to media reports that @entity14 bases were under threat			1
last week it was revealed that sir @entity34 had written to prime minister @entity84 informing him of his intention to write personally to those individuals he intends to criticise , with reports suggesting that @entity21 is among those on sir @entity34 ’s list			0
sir @entity2 has taken a sabbatical from his duties at @entity45 to research and write his record of events			1
with his account nearing completion , he is expected to resume his master ’s role at the start of the new academic year			0
a security source told @entity31 : ‘ this is sir @entity2 ’s time - bomb			1
he wants to set the record straight and defend the integrity of @entity8			0
' and sir @entity2 has taken a lot of personal criticism over @entity8 ’s performance and his supposedly too - cosy relationship with mr @entity21			1
in flames : @entity14 soldiers under attack in the @entity39 town of @entity112 in 2004 ‘ no chief of @entity8 has done anything like this before , but the events in question were unprecedented			0
‘ if @entity57 does n’t put the record straight , sir @entity2 will strike back			1
’ after graduating from @entity45 , sir @entity2 began his @entity8 career in 1966 and was posted to @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 before becoming head of station in @entity126 in 1991			2
he returned to the @entity14 two years later and became director of operations in 1994			0
he was appointed chief , or ‘ c ’ , in 1999			0
in his first year , the @entity130 fired a rocket at the agency ’s headquarters on the @entity134 of the @entity135			0
this was followed in september 2001 by @entity138 ’s attacks on the @entity139 and the @entity140 in the @entity141			0
the @entity142 subsequently accused @entity8 of failing to respond with sufficient urgency to warnings that @entity146 fundamentalists were planning such a major terrorist attack			0
but last night the committee ’s chairman , sir @entity148 , who was appointed in 2010 , offered sir @entity2 his support			2
sir @entity148 told @entity31 : ‘ i have never heard of a former @entity8 chief putting something out there in these terms but i would be interested in what sir @entity2 has to say in response to the @entity12 which is clearly going to have some meat in it			2
‘ i know sir @entity2 and worked with him in the @entity160 many years ago			2
he is a very able man of the highest character and a man of his own opinions			0
we shall have to wait to see what he says			0
’ sir @entity2 , who was elected @entity165 at @entity44 just weeks after leaving @entity8 , lives in an idyllic £ 1.2 million property in the college ’s grounds			2
last night , @entity64 and the office for @entity21 declined to comment on sir @entity2 ’s account .			1

sir @entity2 , 68 provided intelligence about @entity18 *'s* @entity17
had *previously* said he would keep his account of events leading up to @entity15 secret until after his death
