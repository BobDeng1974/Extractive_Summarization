pride : @entity2 poses with the @entity10 trophy during celebrations at @entity13 bubbly : @entity2 's friends spray him with champagne as he parades the trophy on the balcony of the golf club where his love of the sport began hailing the sacrifices made by his parents @entity34 and @entity35 when he was a young golfer trying to make a name for himself , he promised to do all he could to ensure they would enjoy more major victories in the future			1
' it 's fantastic to be back here to see all my friends , my family , ' he said			2
' i ca n't thank my parents enough for what they 've done for me and winning the @entity10 is only a tiny little bit of my appreciation for what they 've done , so hopefully there 's more trophies for them in the future and more things for us to share and celebrate			2
' the homecoming event in @entity57 came a year after similar euphoric scenes in @entity59 , 60 miles up the road , when @entity2 's compatriot and close friend @entity62 won the same tournament			1
' @entity62 inspired me and gave me a lot of belief that i could do the same thing , ' @entity2 added			0

@entity77 , only a few miles from @entity2 's home in @entity57 , @entity14 , has been consumed by rioting over the last two nights as simmering tensions between loyalists and republicans spilled over			1
the golfing sensation said his fellow countrymen and women deserve better			1
crossing divides : returning to a torn @entity77 he said people of the city deserve a peaceful future ' it 's sad to see what 's happened the last couple of nights			1
i know that 99.9 % of the population do n't want to see that			0
and if i can just be a little bit of positivity in the news then that 's great			0
' i think everyone just wants to live in peaceful times , and i think @entity17 deserves it			0
' in a region of numerous divisions , many played out in a sport context , @entity2 is one personality with legions of fans across communities			0
he said he has a responsibility as a role model			0
' i am very aware of the fact that i am going to be portrayed as a role model for a lot of young people in @entity17 , and probably across the world			1
' and i have to be very careful in what i say and what i do , and as long as i portray the right image for other people to look up to , that 's all i can really do			1
' after spending two hours inside the clubhouse , where the walls are covered with pictures of his triumphs , @entity2 emerged onto the balcony to a rapturous welcome from fans waiting below			0
he thanked them all for their support over the 15 years he had been a member , even , he joked , when he was a seven - year - old annoying the club professional			1
the crowd then broke into a spontaneous verse of @entity142 for the @entity143 - a take on the popular chant of @entity145 , @entity2 's favourite team			1

@entity158 : his home town has united to celebrate his victory with all kinds of merchandising popping up like these cakes at a bakery in @entity57 childhood dreams : mcilory with one of his heroes , @entity167 and an early trophy @entity2 said he owed the fans one after failing in the last round of the @entity172 at @entity173 in april , despite going into the final round with a four stroke lead			2
' the support 's been fantastic , ' he said			0
' even before this tournament , at @entity173 i knew how much everyone wanted me to win that			0
fanclub : hundreds of people turned out to see the return of their hero with his silverware ' it felt like this win was not just for myself , it was for everyone who supported me and all i can say is thank you to everyone who believed in me after what happened at @entity173			1
' @entity2 , who was accompanied to the club by childhood sweetheart @entity196 , conceded soaring expectations of what he can achieve in the game would be tough to handle			2
' it 's going to be difficult , ' he said			0
' the first couple of weeks will be a bit of a challenge , but it 's a nice position to be in , to have that pressure , to have that expectation			0
' as long i can stay focused on what i need to do , that is play good golf , and let everything else take care of itself , then i 'll be okay			2
' he also said it was too early in his career to think about long - term goals , such as surpassing the 18 @entity151 haul set by @entity216 or even @entity218 's 14 titles			2
' i 've got my first one out of the way and now i 'm looking for my second and that 's all i can really do , ' he said			0
' i ca n't really put a number on it			0
i 've won one very early on in my career but at the same time i know how hard these things are to win and hopefully i will be able to win more in the future			0
' but 18 majors is an incredible achievement and it would take some very special golf to be able to beat that			2
' the young pretender to @entity218 's throne - some dub him the @entity235 - said he looked forward to the @entity238 star 's return from injury			1
' the game of golf is much better with him there , ' he said			2
