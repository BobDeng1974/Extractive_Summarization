after missing his third cut in as many tournaments in @entity3 last week , @entity0 conceded that his preparation for the 143rd @entity5 was less than ideal			1
in @entity6 on wednesday he remained every bit as candid , giving an interview that opened a portal into what at times sounded like a rather troubled mind ; at the very least the mind of a 41 - year - old golfer wrestling with one or two issues at what appears to be a bit of a crossroads in his career			1
he spoke with refreshing honesty , not least when it came to responding to recent comments made by @entity24			1
indeed , @entity0 said he would not want to be considered if he failed to start playing better , for fear of ‘ letting down his team - mates ’			1
in @entity47 last week , @entity0 pointed to a three - week break as a reason for failing to make the cut			1
after a busy start to the year , he said he had been feeling jaded going into tournaments and required a complete break from the day job			1
‘ i needed to put the clubs away and not even think about golf , ’ he told @entity27 on wednesday			1
‘ so i just spent time with my family			2
i watched a lot of the @entity36 and we had some friends over from @entity61 for my wife ’s 40th birthday			2
’ ( @entity0 lives in @entity64 )			1
because he did not hit a single ball during that period he was , by his own admission , ‘ rusty ’ in @entity3			2
by wednesday he was pleased to report that he was happier with his swing			2
but it remains an introspective @entity0 who tees off at 2.38pm on thursday			1
happier : @entity0 admits he is more pleased with his swing as he pepares to tee off at 2.38pm on thursday concentration : @entity0 had a three - week break from all things golf to recover every player goes into a major hoping to win but in @entity33 year there is an extra incentive			1
@entity0 , however , is applying a touch of realism to his situation and sounds like he would be happy enough just to be striking the ball sweetly again			1
‘ listen , i want to show some form , ’ he said when reminded of @entity24 ’s remarks			1
‘ i ’ve got some big events coming up and i ’d still like to qualify for the ( @entity33 ) team			1
i feel like i can do that if i can get my game in shape			2
but if i did need a pick i ’d want to be playing well			2
’ what he would n’t want is to be selected on reputation alone ; on his fine record as a veteran of eight @entity92			2
‘ no , i would n’t want that , ’ he said			2
‘ you do n’t want to let down your team - mates by playing poorly			1
and obviously if you get picked there ’s a lot of added pressure to perform			2
you ’ve got to justify your pick			2
’ right now @entity0 would not appear to know if he is playing well , even if those close to him would suggest he has been feeling more satisfied about his game than he is perhaps letting on			1
with his son , @entity105 , for company in practice this week he has actually been attacking the course with the precision and creativity it demands			1
‘ you just have to be realistic about your game sometimes , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve been struggling with my swing a little bit recently			0
in good company : @entity0 and his son , @entity105 , during a practice round prior to the @entity5 start what do you think , son ? @entity0 has been attacking the course with precision and creativity ‘ i ’ve been trying to make a few changes but obviously it ’s hard to compete when it ’s like that			1
i played a lot at the start of the year and i did n’t really give myself enough time off			1
i was feeling a bit mentally jaded			0
i ’m still practising just as hard			0
' i want to play			0
but you ’ve got to feel fresh going into the tournaments			0
and i just was n’t getting the balance right between working hard and taking time off			0
‘ that ’s why i took three weeks off			0
i was supposed to play in the middle week in @entity133 but i decided not to in the end			1
i needed to work on my game but i also needed a break			1
it was just a case of which one i needed more			1
’ it all sounds perfectly reasonable			0
a sensible decision by a sensible man			0
but then he says something that suggests he is still wrestling with some fairly major issues			0
‘ in golf you ’ve got to retain that keenness , ’ he said			2
‘ physically i feel the same as ever			0
but when you get to a certain age it becomes a balancing act			0
do you still want to work hard at your game ? ‘ you ’ve got 21 - year - old kids who are dedicating their whole life to their game			1
when you ’ve got a family , a wife and kids , you have to compartmentalise it a lot better			0
focus : @entity0 says he finds it difficult to dedicate himself to the game with a family to look after ' i ’ve been doing a bit of work with my coach over the last three or four days and i feel like i ’ve found something i can take on to the golf course			1
i saw @entity169 ( his sports psychologist ) on wednesday			0
@entity169 has given me a few pointers to take out there			0
’ @entity0 says he can take encouragement from his performance in last year ’s @entity5 , even if it did end in crushing disappointment after going into the final round at @entity177 with a two - stroke lead			1
‘ i did n’t feel i played that well at @entity177 , ’ he said			0
‘ i putted really well			0
but i do n’t feel like i ’ve struck the ball as well as i ’d like to for a couple of years now			0
certainly not well enough to win tournaments on a consistent basis			0
‘ and the fact that i ’ve still managed to keep winning the odd tournament and play consistently means the mental attitude going into tournaments is right			0
i just need to start hitting the ball better			0
’ even so , he does appear flatter than a potential winner of this championship perhaps should			0
‘ i ’m not flat , ’ he insisted with a flash of defiance			0
‘ i ’m always keen to do well and i go into every major trying to win			0
i look forward to this time of year			2
' and in three out of the last five years i ’ve been in the top three			0
so if i start playing well i expect to be in contention			0
’ and not just for @entity5			1
raring to go : @entity0 says ' if i start playing well i expect to be in contention '			1
