@entity0 admits @entity1 need a ' crack ' player to take them to the next level			1
the term is used in @entity6 to describe a world star , a galactico , who can transform the team			0
the reigning @entity11 champions saw their hopes of retaining the title diminish after a shock 1 - 0 defeat by @entity16 on saturday			0
here @entity17 identifies five names @entity1 have considered as they approach a pivotal summer in their development			2
@entity0 insists @entity21 needs another ' crack ' player to support him at the @entity24 despite his expensively assembled squad , @entity0 still thinks @entity1 need more star quality @entity21 failed to score as the champion 's hopes of retaining the title suffered a blow against @entity16 @entity31 @entity32 £ 55m @entity1 have trailed @entity31 since he was on their doorstep at @entity34			1
the 22 - year - old can be the dominant force in @entity1 's midfield for years to come and add the extra energy they have lacked this year			2
@entity32 general director @entity40 said : ' there are many suitors for @entity31 , but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us			2
' that said if clubs offer £ 55m it will be difficult for the @entity48 to reject			0
chances : 4/5 former @entity34 midfielder @entity31 has become one of the world 's best midfielders at @entity32 the @entity48 insist @entity31 is not for sale but an offer in excess of £ 55m could prove too tempting @entity56 @entity57 £ 35m has grown into one of the best midfielders in @entity59 on current form			1
he is playing as a no 10 , dominating games , creating chances and scoring goals			0
the @entity66 could prove to be one of @entity69 's biggest mistakes			0
yes , @entity70 made a profit when they sold him but he now looks a player who can have greater influence on a game than @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity1 have watched him closely this season and @entity57 expect a bid			0
chances : 4/5 the @entity82 international has been starring in the @entity83 since his move from @entity70 to @entity57 the @entity82 international 's recent form has raised questions over why @entity69 let him leave @entity70 @entity88 @entity89 £ 44m the jewel in the crown of @entity89			1
managers have gone to watch him and questioned whether he was big and strong enough for the @entity11 but he is 5ft 10ins and , like the smaller @entity95 at @entity96 , @entity88 has the athleticism and strength which allows him to handle the rough treatment			0
has proven at @entity102 and domestic level he is a player of repute			0
much will depend where @entity105 ends up			0
chances : 2/5 @entity89 's pass master @entity88 is seen as the heir in waiting to @entity111 's @entity110 in @entity6 @entity88 celebrates his goal against @entity113 with former @entity70 striker @entity114 ( right ) @entity115 @entity116 £ 75m @entity115 is determined to ride out the storm in @entity89 but wo n't be short of admirers should he opt to leave			1
despite the fuss over @entity34 's overtures to him , @entity115 was aware of @entity1 's interest prior to his departure from @entity123 and would listen if his time at @entity89 was up			1
a homegrown player to boot , he has matured since leaving @entity127 and would give @entity1 the pace and direct dynamic they have lacked this season			2
chances : 3/5 @entity115 's struggles to win over @entity116 's fickle fans could lead to a return to the @entity11 @entity115 scored twice in the weekend win over @entity135 , which will have pleased some fans if not @entity138 @entity139 double silences critics @entity138 @entity116 £ 80m surely not ? the chat among some @entity1 players last week was that @entity138 was destined for @entity143 and not the @entity145 side			1
it 's almost unthinkable considering his affection for all things @entity34			0
his agent @entity149 says he will retire at @entity89 but tensions are undoubtedly high as the unforgiving @entity152 crowd see fit to criticise a phenomenal player who has scored 280 goals for them			2
chances : 1/5 they say never say never , but surely @entity138 signing for @entity34 's rivals is unimaginable ? the @entity160 holder was supposed to finish his career at the @entity152 but has cut a frustrated figure			1

@entity0 has said @entity1 need another ' crack ' player in squad
@entity116 stars @entity138 and @entity115 have been mooted
a return to @entity143 for former @entity34 ace @entity31 is on the cards
former @entity70 midfielder @entity56 and @entity89 pass master @entity88 are other *alternatives*
