by @entity0 @entity1 has captured one of the most active aurora ever seen on @entity4			1
researchers say the incredible video created by @entity7 and @entity8 give the ' best look yet ' at the phenomenon			1
they say the video will give a major step forward in understanding the atmospheres of giant planets			1
@entity1 trained several pairs of eyes on @entity4 as the planet put on a dancing light show at its poles			2
while the @entity7 , orbiting around @entity21 , was able to observe the northern auroras in ultraviolet wavelengths , @entity1 's @entity8 spacecraft , orbiting around @entity4 , got complementary close - up views in infrared , visible - light and ultraviolet wavelengths			1
@entity8 could also see northern and southern parts of @entity4 that do n't face @entity21			2
the resulting video is ' a kind of step - by - step choreography detailing how the auroras move , showing the complexity of these auroras and how scientists can connect an outburst from the sun and its effect on the magnetic environment at @entity4 , ' says @entity1			1
' @entity4 's auroras can be fickle -- you may see fireworks , you may see nothing , ' said @entity50 of the @entity51 in @entity52 , who led the work on the @entity7 images			1
' in 2013 , we were treated to a veritable smorgasbord of dancing auroras , from steadily shining rings to super-fast bursts of light shooting across the pole			0
' the @entity7 and @entity8 images were focused on april and may of 2013			1
images from @entity8 's ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( @entity64 ) , obtained from an unusually close range of about six @entity4 radii , provided a look at the changing patterns of faint emissions on scales of a few hundred miles ( kilometers ) and tied the changes in the auroras to the fluctuating wind of charged particles blowing off the sun and flowing past @entity4			1
' this is our best look yet at the rapidly changing patterns of auroral emission , ' said @entity79 , a @entity8 co-investigator at @entity80			2
' some bright spots come and go from image to image			0
' other bright features persist and rotate around the pole , but at a rate slower than @entity4 's rotation			0
' the dark region seen on the face of the sun at the end of march 2013 is a coronal hole ( just above and to the right of the middle of the picture ) , which is a source of fast solar wind leaving the sun , and caused the aurora on @entity4 the image also suggest that one way the bright auroral storms may be produced is by the formation of new connections between magnetic field lines			0
that process causes storms in the magnetic bubble around @entity21			0
the movie also shows one persistent bright patch of the aurora rotating in lockstep with the orbital position of @entity4 's @entity113			2
while previous @entity64 images had shown an intermittent auroral bright spot magnetically linked to the @entity117 , the new movie suggests another @entity4 moon can influence the light show as well			0
the new data also give scientists clues to a long - standing mystery about the atmospheres of giant outer planets			0
' scientists have wondered why the high atmospheres of @entity4 and other gas giants are heated far beyond what might normally be expected by their distance from the sun , ' said @entity132 , a @entity8 visual and infrared mapping spectrometer team associate at @entity135 , @entity52			2
' by looking at these long sequences of images taken by different instruments , we can discover where the aurora heats the atmosphere as the particles dive into it and how long the cooking occurs			0
' the visible - light data have helped scientists work out the colors of @entity4 's auroras			0
while the curtain - like auroras we see at @entity21 are green at the bottom and red at the top , @entity8 's imaging cameras have shown us similar curtain - like auroras at @entity4 that are red at the bottom and purple at the top , said @entity162 , an imaging team associate at the @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 the color difference occurs because @entity21 's auroras are dominated by excited nitrogen and oxygen molecules , and @entity4 's auroras are dominated by excited hydrogen molecules			1
' we were thrilled to learn about this colorful display that no one had seen before , ' @entity162 said			0
' the auroras at @entity4 are some of the planet 's most glamorous features â€“ and there was no escaping @entity1 's paparazzi - like attention ' , said @entity178 , a @entity8 fields and particles scientist at @entity1 's @entity181 , @entity164 , @entity165 , who is helping to coordinate these observations .			1

@entity1 video shows the northern auroras in *unprecedented* detail
@entity7 and @entity8 images captured one of the most varied displays ever seen
gives *astronomers* new *insight* into giant planet 's atmospheres
