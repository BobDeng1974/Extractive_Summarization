published : 04:17 est , 28 july 2012 updated : 13:00 est , 28 july 2012 with its pastoral scenes , tributes to the @entity1 and @entity2 , dark , satanic mills , references to @entity6 , yellow submarines and @entity8 , last night 's spectacular @entity9 was certainly very @entity10			1
with an eclectic soundtrack featuring orchestral through to punk , stopping at @entity14 on the way , it was at times quite literally @entity17			2
it was almost as if @entity19 was putting on a show for the @entity21 , rather than the rest of the world , so what did the rest of the world make of it ? well , more than a billion apparently tuned in and the response was pretty mixed			2
the @entity30 's cameo appearance was a particular highlight for the @entity33 audience as she took part in a comical segment filmed in @entity36 with @entity37 , before seemingly parachuting into the @entity38 with the @entity6 star			2
but some of the more obscure references left many scratching their heads			2
larger than life : a grotesque giant puppet of @entity45 's @entity30 pokes through a huge hospital bed during the extravagant @entity1 tribute segment ' quirky ' : the @entity48 called it a ' noisy , busy , witty , dizzying production ' ' kaleidoscopic ' : @entity51 celebrated a show it said highlighted @entity54 's ' grandeur and eccentricities ' low point : the @entity57 , whose sports reporter said she was ' baffled ' by the @entity1 segment the world is watching : @entity63 's @entity62 , calling @entity64 ' the centre of the world ' @entity57 sports reporter @entity67 tweeted : ' @entity6 and @entity69 ' parachute ' into the stadium , then kids in pyjamas sing the national anthem ... works for me			2
' another @entity57 reporter , who tweeted shortly after @entity77 author @entity76 read from @entity78 , said : ' @entity69 acting , @entity76 reading in public , can you top this ? ' the appearance of mr @entity84 also got viewers from the other side of the @entity88 chuckling , with @entity90 's comical character seeming to go down well with the @entity92 press			2
mr @entity67 tweeted : ' mr @entity84 hams it up during playing of @entity94 ... hilarious			2
. this is becoming ca n't - miss ceremony			1
' a fellow @entity57 reporter wrote : ' @entity90 segment , very clever			2
' @entity100 entrance : the ' @entity30 ' parachuting into the stadium was a highlight for amused viewers send in the clown : @entity90 's appearance went down a storm thanks to the international appeal of his mr @entity84 character the @entity110 's own @entity109 called it ' the barmiest @entity9 in @entity112 history , an explosion of nonsense and tremendous good fun ' - despite it being ' a bit tinky winky and laa - la at times '			1
@entity19 's masterpiece received a five - star rave from the @entity120 , which hailed it as ' the biggest , maddest , weirdest , most heartfelt and lovable dream sequence in @entity10 cinema history '			2
the @entity124 saw it as ' breathtakingly politically charged ' in comparison to previous opening ceremonies , saying that it was ' about punk rather than pomp '			0
and although ' utterly compelling ' , the paper 's critic wrote , ' the show periodically lost focus combined sometimes with an almost baffling level of visual detail '			0
for the @entity137 , it was ' a celebration of our genius , tolerance , humour , and all we have given to the world ' , adding that ' it was hard to think of any @entity10 icon it did nâ€™t reference '			0
another wrote : ' @entity84 one of the night 's scripted surprises			0
' the ceremony 's showcasing of @entity54 's rich musical history was another highlight with the use of songs from @entity10 's finest singers and performers seeming to be a massive hit			1
@entity157 from the @entity158 tweeted : ' the jam has been played			0
i can go home now			0
oh , wait , @entity162 and sir @entity163 still to come			0
' @entity158 and @entity57 journalist @entity165 tweeted : ' did @entity166 produce this ? ' he also heaped praise on the upbeat nature of the athletes ' parade			1
' this parade of athletes has much more of a party atmosphere than in past ... feels like closing ceremony mood , ' he said			1
the cinematic element of the ceremony was singled out , with the @entity48 describing the show as ' visually stunning '			1
but some segments of the showpiece seemed to be lost on particular viewers			0
@entity57 sports writer @entity182 said : ' for the life of me , though , am still baffled by @entity1 tribute at opening ceremonies			0
like tribute to @entity188 or something in @entity92			0
' the fact the @entity112 torch was lit by a number of young athletes seemed unpopular with some			1
' musical heaven ' : sir @entity195 tops off a tuneful few hours , which led one @entity92 journalist to ask ' did @entity166 produce this ? ' lost on some : dancers dressed as nurses in the @entity1 and @entity202 tribute scene , which meant little to much of the international audience star of the show : @entity208 's @entity207 , whose headline reads ' for one night , the @entity30 becomes a @entity211 ' spectacular : @entity214 's @entity213 emblazoned its front page with the rings dripping with sparks mr @entity67 tweeted : ' very symbolic ending , but sort of anticlimatic ... i like my cauldron lit by one person ... and a person people have heard of			1
' @entity224 from the @entity57 wrote : ' hated the flame lighting			1
just make a decision and pick someone			0
' the decision to ask former @entity229 @entity195 to sing out the ceremony was well received			1
@entity231 from the @entity158 said : ' @entity195 can still bring it ... na , na , na , na , na , na , na , na ... show ending appropriately on a high after confusing cauldron lighting			1
' @entity236 journalist @entity235 said that @entity19 had ' hit the nail on the head ' with the opening ceremony			1
the @entity242 - based @entity241 presenter told @entity243 : ' it was a fantastic start to the @entity245			0
i 'm so glad there was no temptation to be better and bigger than @entity249 - it was wonderful in its own way and it all came across so well			0
' she added : ' visually it looked spectacular , there was humour and the overall picture - i think he ( @entity19 ) hit the nail on the head			0
' mrs @entity235 said the length of the show was a negative point and also expressed disappointment over the lighting of the cauldron			1
who ? the decision to have seven unknown young athletes light the flame was seen by some as a cop - out and an anti-climax ' @entity10 fancifulness ' : an army of actresses dressed as @entity8 float across the arena ' i really loved the inspiration of a new generation , but it kind of felt a bit of an anti-climax at that point			1
' meanwhile , the @entity48 described the ' hilariously quirky ' celebration as a ' noisy , busy , witty , dizzying production '			0
it added : ' @entity54 presented itself to the world friday night as something it has often struggled to express even to itself : a nation secure in its own post-empire identity , whatever that actually is			0
' the @entity57 also heaped further praise on the occasion			0
it said in a review of the ceremony : ' an atmosphere of whimsy and party won out over pomp and circumstance during an @entity112 opening ceremony that allowed an economically beleaguered @entity54 to pat itself on the back			1
' the ceremony could not have been more of a contrast from @entity249 's four years ago , replacing @entity307 militaristic precision with @entity10 fancifulness			1
' the @entity309 called the ceremony ' dazzling ' , adding that @entity64 had ' presented a vibrant picture of @entity54 's rich heritage and culture '			1
for the @entity318 , another of @entity317 's biggest papers , it was a ' cultural tour de force ' , while the input of composer @entity321 , who scored @entity19 's @entity322 , was said to celebrate ' the @entity317 influences on the @entity10 '			0
meanwhile the @entity51 said the pageant was ' kaleidoscopic '			0
' @entity54 's @entity69 declared the @entity325 open after playing a cameo role in a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation that invented modern sport , ' it said			1
