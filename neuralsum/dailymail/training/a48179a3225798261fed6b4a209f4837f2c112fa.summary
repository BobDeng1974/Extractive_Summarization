@entity0 publicly criticised @entity1 @entity0 left an audience in shocked silence at a @entity5 fundraiser attended by @entity6 by publicly criticising the @entity1 investigation into historic sex abuse			1
the @entity5 - supporting actor , who was hosting the event , complained that fewer than 50 per cent of those people held under @entity12 have been found guilty and that those who make false accusations should be prosecuted			1
but last night mr @entity6 ’s office issued a rebuke to @entity0 by insisting that the party fully supported @entity12 and making clear that mr @entity6 ’s ‘ thoughts were with the victims ’			1
@entity0 singled out for criticism sir @entity19 , the former director of public prosecutions ( @entity19 ) , who was present at the gala dinner last wednesday			1
sir @entity19 was the architect of the successful prosecutions under @entity12 – the @entity25 operation spawned by the sir @entity27 abuse scandal – of entertainer @entity28 , publicist @entity29 and tv presenter @entity30			2
but @entity12 has also led to failed prosecutions against entertainers including @entity34 star @entity33			0
and cases were dropped against comedians @entity36 , @entity38 and @entity39 after months of destructive publicity			0
@entity0 ’s friend , the @entity42 dj @entity41 , was arrested in october as part of @entity1 on suspicion of historical sexual offences , but was released on bail and has never been charged with any offence			1
@entity0 , 56 , is understood to be infuriated that the failure to charge @entity41 has received significantly less publicity than his arrest , leaving an unfair stain on his character			1
the @entity53 and @entity54 star , who hosted the event at @entity57 ’s @entity56 – with tables of nine costing up to £ 15,000 – stunned the crowd by referring to the growing political storm at @entity61 over allegations of an establishment cover - up over a supposed child sex abuse ring			2
@entity0 , who has a reputation for standing up for human rights , urged the crowd to remember some of ‘ the essential values which the @entity5 stands for ’ , including that ‘ people are innocent until proven guilty ’			1
after citing @entity70 , the 799 - year - old foundation of @entity73 constitutional rights , @entity0 said that ‘ fewer than half ’ of the people held under @entity12 had been found guilty – before identifying sir @entity19 in the audience			1
@entity0 singled out for criticism sir @entity19 , the former @entity19 , who was present at the gala dinner the actor then launched into what one guest described as a ‘ rant ’ about how the law should be toughened up to deter people from inventing claims about sex abuse			1
‘ it was all a bit awkward , ’ the guest told @entity88			0
‘ there was a smattering of applause , but mostly there was this deadly silence			0
and @entity6 looked as if he had swallowed a wasp			0
’ however , @entity25 has faced criticism from a variety of quarters over its handling of high profile investigations such as its £ 30million inquiries into phone hacking , and allegations that journalists bribed public officials , broke into computers and were guilty of other privacy breaches			0
least 30 journalists remain on bail , some of whom have been in that position – unable to resume their careers – for more than two years			0
last night , a source close to sir @entity19 , who left his office last november and is believed to be considering a career as a @entity5 politician , said : ‘ the silence was pretty profound when @entity0 went off on one			1
it was a strange moment			0
i think he was falsely equating the failure to mount a successful prosecution with malicious accusations			0
‘ if accusations are faked then there is the crime of perverting the cause of justice , in which case the accusers do lose their right to anonymity			0
what @entity12 and the prosecutions has achieved was help and publicity for a previously unprotected group of victims , who felt that their abusers had been unfairly ring - fenced			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity6 said : ‘ @entity6 fully supports the work of @entity1 and has made clear all along that our thoughts should be with the victims			2
the @entity5 gala dinner was a hugely successful event and we are very grateful to @entity0 for hosting it			2
’ last night @entity0 did not comment .			2
