@entity0 vowed to fight ' incredibly hard ' to secure a good deal at today 's @entity3 summit @entity5 leaders today claimed @entity6 will ' have to be convinced ' to accept a rise in @entity9 spending as @entity0 scrambled to build support for a real terms freeze			1
the prime minister today warned any increase in the @entity3 's budget would be ' quite wrong '			1
he vowed to protect the @entity6 's prized rebate from @entity9 negotiated by @entity16 in 1984			1
but @entity17 , @entity18 's pm calling for a @entity20 increase , said @entity6 will have to fall into line			1
' i ca n't imagine how we can convince them , but they will have to be convinced , ' he told reporters as talks began in @entity9			2
mr @entity0 flew out of @entity6 early this morning to be the first leader to hold face - to - face talks with @entity30 , president of the @entity31 and @entity33 president @entity32			1
the pair are meeting the other 26 @entity3 leaders today ahead of formal talks over dinner tonight			1
but tensions are already rising , with @entity6 demanding a cut or freeze in spending while other countries who benefit from vast @entity3 handouts demanding big rises			1
@entity45 and the @entity46 have joined @entity6 in demanding big cuts			1
@entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 want to freeze the maximum @entity9 can draw from member states every year			2
but 15 countries , led by @entity54 , want to see budget increases			0
amid growing speculation that the summit could continue until sunday , @entity46 pm @entity56 warned a deal will have to be done quickly or risk souring relations for months			0
' if it does n't happen at once we have to avoid worsening the atmosphere by so much that we need months to restore personal relations			0
' asked if he was ready to veto an unfavourable deal , mr @entity56 added : ' my idea is that you have to keep your loaded gun in your pocket and once you put it on the table you are putting so much pressure on the negotiations that they do n't lead anywhere			0
i always have a loaded gun in my pocket during negotiations , only figuratively speaking , of course			0
' mr @entity0 , who had a half hour meeting with mr @entity30 and mr @entity32 , said : ' these are very important negotiations and clearly , at a time when we 're making difficult decisions at home over public spending , it would be quite wrong - it is quite wrong - for there to be proposals for this increased extra spending in the @entity3			0
' so we 're going to be negotiating very hard for a good deal for @entity6 's taxpayers and for @entity5 's taxpayers , and to keep the @entity6 rebate			1
' the summit will look to set the maximum ceiling for @entity3 spending for 2014 to 2020 rather than the @entity6 's contribution			2
mr @entity30 has drawn up plans for a ceiling of 973 billion euros ( £ 783 billion ) at 2011 values			0
this would represent a real - terms cut compared to the 993 billion euros limit for 2007 - 13			0
it is also well below the @entity33 's request for 1,033 billion euros			0
@entity109 said today : ' what we want from the @entity3 is just common sense			1
there is not enough money to go around at the moment			0
everyone is tightening their belts , let 's make sure it is reflected in the @entity3 budget			0
' the prime minister has vowed to fight ' incredibly hard ' to protect @entity6 's rebate a @entity6 official said today : ' the prime minister wants an agreement , he is looking for an agreement , " said one @entity6 official			1
but he wants the @entity3 budget to reflect what is happening in member states - and he wants the best deal for @entity6 taxpayers			2
' mr @entity30 is holding one - on - one talks with all 27 leaders , including mr @entity0 , today before the summit formally opens			2
later he will produce a new ' negotiation box ' which will try to take account of all the competing priorities of different countries			0
there will then be a new round of wrangling			0
a third of countries is threatening to use a veto			0
the summit is due to end on friday , but could last until saturday or even sunday			0
one official said : ' mr @entity30 will keep the leaders talking as long as it looks likely that there can be agreement			2
' but he will not want to keep them at the negotiating table all weekend if the result is going to be a failure			0
there is the credibility of the @entity3 to consider - better to end early and return another day than end in complete disarray			2
' leaders arriving at the summit today included @entity33 president @entity32 , who has criticised those calling for a spending cut , and @entity162 president @entity161 ahead of today 's crunch summit that is turning into a key diplomatic test of mr @entity0 ’s premiership , @entity49 made it clear it is aiming to prise more cash out of the @entity6 in the @entity3 ’s budget settlement for 2014 to 2020			1
@entity49 ’s socialist president @entity169 launched a thinly veiled attack on @entity6 ’s ‘ lack of solidarity ’ with @entity5 for demanding it maintains its budget rebate			1
mr @entity169 , whose country lost its @entity177 credit rating this week after putting the brakes on austerity measures , said countries he ‘ would not name ’ would come to the @entity3 budget summit in @entity9 today looking for ‘ their discounts ’			0
‘ at the exact moment we are calling for solidarity and mobilisation for growth , there are these countries that will be coming to get their cheques , their rebates and their discounts , ’ he declared			0
‘ the idea that they have of @entity5 is to obtain exactly what they put in , as if solidarity does n’t represent the most fortunate providing for the most hard up			2
’ @entity16 found that @entity6 's payments were relatively higher than other countries and last night @entity33 president @entity32 attacked those – such as mr @entity0 – proposing cuts to @entity3 spending			1
‘ the @entity5 budget is not , as is sometimes claimed , a budget for @entity9 or @entity206 , ’ he said			2
‘ it is a budget for investing in the economy of all member states			0
‘ i have listened to the preparatory discussions , which all focus on how to make cuts			0
there is no real debate on the quality of investment – it is just cuts , cuts , cuts			0
’ @entity31 president @entity30 appears open to @entity6 demands that the @entity3 budget should be cut , but is understood to be proposing an £ 800million - a - year reduction in the rebate			1
but in a sign of the scale of disagreement across the @entity228 , @entity6 is just one of ten countries threatening to block the proposed deal if changes are not made			1
in the @entity235 , @entity234 mp @entity233 challenged mr @entity0 to promise to veto any deal that reduces the rebate			2
the prime minister answered : ‘ i can give my honourable friend that assurance			1
the rebate , negotiated by @entity16 , is an incredibly important part of making sure @entity6 gets a fair deal in @entity5			1
’ @entity0 seen with president of the @entity31 , @entity30 , will discuss the @entity3 's budget cut mr @entity0 launched a strong attack on @entity247 for giving up a chunk of the rebate in 2005 in return for reforms of agricultural subsidies that never materialised			0
‘ it is absolutely extraordinary that the last government gave away almost half of that rebate and we ’ve never heard one word of apology , one word of regret , for the fact that however hard we fight in @entity5 – and i will be fighting incredibly hard this week for a good deal – they cut away our feet by giving away half the rebate , ’ he said			1
the rebate secured by @entity16 in @entity267 in 1984 is designed to compensate the @entity6 for the fact that it receives relatively little support under the @entity270 compared with similarly sized economies such as @entity49			1
it is worth about £ 2.9billion , and meant that @entity6 ’s net contribution to the @entity3 budget in 2010 was £ 5.9billion rather than £ 8.8billion			2
@entity247 agreed that the rebate should no longer apply to investment in relatively poor new member states , meaning @entity6 ’s contributions will inevitably rise as the @entity3 enlarges .			1

prime minister takes early *flight* to start crunch talks with @entity5 leaders
he has vowed to protect the rebate secured by @entity16 in 1984
@entity109 urges ' common sense ' when all governments are cutting back
but @entity49 made it clear it is aiming to prise more cash out of the @entity6
