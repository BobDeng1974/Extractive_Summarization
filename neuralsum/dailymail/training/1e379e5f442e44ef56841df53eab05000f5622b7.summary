by @entity0 as dr @entity2 begins surgery to create a functioning penis for a @entity6 monk who was born female , he is well aware of the unease his work creates in this deeply conservative country			1
the devout @entity11 known as the ' father of @entity14 transgender people ' once wrestled with similar feelings			1
' i 've decided to defy @entity19 's will , ' dr @entity2 , 61 , said in an interview before the monk 's recent successful surgery to become a man			1
' at first , i agonized over whether i should do these operations because i wondered if i was defying @entity19			0
i was overcome with a sense of shame			0
but my patients desperately wanted these surgeries			0
without them , they 'd kill themselves			0
' dr @entity2 is a pioneer in slowly changing views on sexuality and gender in @entity14 , where many have long considered even discussions of sexuality a taboo			1

he believes he 's correcting what he calls @entity19 's mistakes			2
' some people are born without genitals or with cleft lips or with no ears or with their fingers stuck together			0
why does @entity19 create people like this ? are n't these @entity19 's mistakes ? ' dr @entity2 said			1
' and is n't a mismatched sexual identity a mistake , too ? ' a strong bias against sexual minorities persists in @entity14 , the result of lingering @entity80 beliefs that children should never damage the bodies they received from their parents ; a large , vocal conservative @entity47 community ; and past military - backed dictatorships that ignored minority voices			1
sex change operations ' are a blasphemy against @entity19 and make the world a more miserable place , ' said the rev. @entity91 , president of the @entity93 - based @entity92			0

' his work : @entity96 , @entity14 's most famous transsexual entertainer , underwent a sex - change operation from dr. @entity2 and compares her transformation to @entity99 dr @entity2 , a plastic surgeon at @entity42 in the southeastern port city of @entity43 , specializes in fixing facial deformities			1
he began doing sex change operations in 1986 after several men wearing women 's clothing visited him separately and asked him to construct vaginas for them			2
the first visitor had already had his penis removed , @entity2 said			1
dr @entity2 initially turned them away because he knew nothing about sex change surgery			1
but he kept thinking about their pleas , studied foreign publications and began performing the surgeries a year later			0

' but days later , when she left the hospital , she felt reborn , comparing her transformation to the @entity131 film @entity99 , where a mermaid gives up her fish tail in exchange for human legs and eventual happiness			0
many of dr @entity2 's earliest patients were in their 40s and 50s			1
sometimes parents showed up just before surgeries , furious and threatening to disown their children			2

at the same time , activists say transsexuals remain likely to face harassment , abuse or insults , and many suffer from depression and have attempted suicide			0
the conservative government of president @entity187 , which took office in early 2013 , said it would create a broad anti-discrimination law , but there 's been no major progress			2
in 2012 , vehement protests by conservative activists and @entity47 groups forced a tv channel to scrap a talk show program featuring transgender people after airing its first segment			0
transgender people who want to legally change their gender also face obstacles in @entity14			1
the @entity202 suggests that judges allow such changes only for those who have undergone sex change operations , have lost reproductive capability , are not married and have no underage children			2
the lack of any binding rules has led transsexuals to flock to judges rumored to be less strict about approving gender change requests , according to @entity213 , leader of the @entity214 in @entity93			2
last year a @entity93 court approved gender change requests for five people even though they had n't yet completed their female - to - male procedures , something previously deemed necessary			0

before her surgery , @entity96 , the transsexual entertainer , signed a document acknowledging that she knew she could die during surgery , though @entity2 said none of his sex - change operations have gone so horribly wrong			1
' if i had lived as a man without undergoing a sex change operation , i might be dead already , ' @entity96 said			2
' i was already a woman except for my genitals			0
i did n't want to live an awkward life with those genitals ... i 'm a woman , so i wanted to live as a woman			0
