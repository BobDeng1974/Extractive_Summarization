@entity7 's timing on the pitch , his ability to see the space , switch gear and bustle in at just the right moment , is exemplary			2
but the @entity10 midfielder must wish more of his peers and observers had the capability to match it			1
the @entity15 's superb individual goal against @entity16 on wednesday night was apparently scored by only the third best player in the @entity18			2
it must be some competition , the @entity22 top flight , if a midfielder can score 20 league goals in a potentially title - winning campaign , display such power , strength , vision and skill and yet only be third in the queue			1
@entity7 has claimed he missed out on becoming the first @entity31 to be crowned the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) @entity33 because of his nationality , but it 's more complex than that			1
it 's a question of timing and momentum and the value of stunningly memorable goal - scoring performances over relentless consistency			0
it is blindingly obvious that @entity45 is a prodigiously talented footballer : nippy , deft , clinical and exciting to watch			0
but the @entity7 machine takes a little longer to wind up			0
he trundles around the pitch at times , his heavy frame looking more likely to succumb to injury than make a match - winning difference			0
but it is that burst of pace that makes him such a wonderful player			0
he simply has a higher gear than most of those around him			0
watch the way he circled the edge of the area in the build - up to @entity59 's third goal for @entity10 against @entity16 : waiting , waiting , waiting and then , bang , he was in to bustle past defenders and provide the assist			2
you do n't know you have been @entity95 until he has shrugged you aside			0
individual awards are also about winning teams			0
or they should be , anyway			0
maybe not so much for the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) @entity100 , which is given to the player considered the best ' by precept and example ' and was won by @entity104 in the season he was relegated with @entity106 , but certainly the @entity32 award			1
it should be given to the player who has performed the best when it matters most and , in 2014 , this means when the @entity18 title is at stake			2
top two : @entity115 's @entity45 ( right ) and @entity117 's @entity116 ( left ) finished above @entity7 in the @entity119 vote key man : @entity7 has bagged 20 @entity18 goals from midfield to leave @entity10 on the brink of the title @entity125 said : ' when you are voting for the best player , it should n't just be about the number of goals you have scored or the number of assists you have made			1
it should also be about whether you have done great things against the biggest teams in the biggest games			0
' look at what @entity7 has done in his years at @entity138 – he is the biggest big - game player in the @entity18			1
' in the @entity143 final this season , we were losing against @entity144 and things were very difficult , but then @entity7 scored an unbelievable goal and we go on to win the trophy			2
' that was the mark of a player – but @entity7 does that in every big game			0
' @entity7 , 31 next week , already has a @entity143 winners ' medal this season , having scored @entity10 's equaliser in the final against @entity144 , and is one more win away from getting his hands on one the @entity18 trophy , too			1
comeback kings : @entity7 helped @entity10 beat @entity144 in the @entity143 final with this stunning goal driving force : @entity7 , pictured here scoring against rivals @entity162 , has been the model of consistency in the heart of @entity10 's midfield but when the shortlist for the @entity119 was announced on april 18 , @entity115 were two points clear at the top of the @entity18 table			1
@entity10 were six points behind in third place , with a game in hand over @entity176 ' side			2
@entity7 made the six - man shortlist , but there was only ever going to be one winner , @entity45 , who duly lifted the award on april 27			1
that day , the @entity182 had failed to break down @entity117 's defence as his side suffered a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity186			0
some 230 miles away at @entity187 , @entity7 had scored @entity10 's second goal against @entity189 ; a brilliant , powerful effort that killed off any @entity189 threat and put @entity138 in the driving seat to win their second @entity18 title in three years			1
it was also a masterclass in performing when it matters most , and a timely , if unconscious , rebuke to those who had overlooked @entity7 's ability			0
on fire : @entity115 striker @entity45 is the league 's top scorer with 31 goals this season game over : @entity7 sealed a vital 2 - 0 win against @entity189 with this goal past @entity204 yet it was @entity45 who was crowned the @entity207 eight days later , too			1
journalists could vote up until noon on may 5 and awarded the @entity115 striker a prestigious double for his then - haul of 30 @entity18 goals			1
it 's 31 now , a joint record with @entity214 and @entity215 in a 38 - game season , and deserved recognition for a wonderful season			0
but had the deadline been just 24 hours later , after @entity115 's 3 - 3 capitulation at @entity189 , it might just have been @entity7 being honoured on may 15 instead			2
with the @entity10 midfielder it 's all about the timing , after all .			1

@entity7 missed out as @entity32 and @entity207 to @entity45
the @entity10 midfielder has been in superb form this season , scoring 20 @entity18 goals
@entity7 has helped @entity56 's side close in on their second title in three years
@entity115 were top of the league when voting for the @entity99 award finished
