@entity0 hailed @entity1 as a quick learner as the @entity4 winger showed he had reaped the benefits of shooting practice			1
the @entity4 winger showed great composure to score the only goal of the game at @entity10 , rounding @entity12 keeper @entity11 before sliding his effort into an empty net			1
in a similar situation at @entity16 two weeks ago , @entity1 missed a number of chances but , since then , the 20 - year - old has scored three times in three appearances and @entity23 ’s manager explained he has been doing intense training at @entity25			1
he is in a position now , he will receive a lot of opportunities in that kind of situation because of his pace			2
his pace will take him away from anyone and since that game he has gone away with the coaches and worked on that type of finish , both left side and right side			1
‘ he showed great composure and a great ability to learn , to beat the keeper and finished it really well			2
his development and ability to want to be better has got us the three points			1
’ @entity1 slots the ball into empty net to give @entity23 the lead @entity1 was the match winner for @entity23 as they won at @entity12 @entity12 were much the better side in the first half but when asked if @entity23 were fortunate , @entity0 said : ‘ not at all			1
i thought that in terms of our character and resilience in the game we showed outstanding qualities when needed			1
there were n’t many chances but the one clear one that came to us , we put it away			2
we deserved three points for the character we showed			1
’ @entity12 boss @entity71 argued : ' we had our pocket pinched today with how they got away with a win			1
@entity0 was pleased to see @entity23 win away at @entity12 ' i do n’t remember @entity11 making too many saves and i remember our back four being on the front foot			1
they have a group of very talented players			2
you look at the group , the signings they have made , you know it is a challenge			0
' meanwhile , @entity88 will return to @entity23 ’s goal on monday night after @entity90 was injured during the game			1
reserve keeper @entity92 will be @entity88 ’s deputy			0
@entity90 - 5.5 replaced after a quarter - of - an - hour by @entity88			0
little to do before picking up his injury , although he did stand helpless as a @entity97 strike hit the post from distance			0
@entity100 - 5.5 substituted after 45 minutes			0
struggled with the movement of @entity97 and @entity102			0
@entity103 - 6 @entity23 ’s most confident and dominant defender			1
had to organise well with @entity88 so nervy behind him			0
@entity105 - 6 powerful in the air but awkward in possession			0
defended well , though , and that ’s his job			0
@entity111 - 6 typically industrious but he is not a wing - back			0
looks like a square peg in a round hole at the moment			0
@entity116 - 6.5 sluggish early on but grew in authority as the game went on			2
a useful foil for @entity120 in the middle			0
@entity120 - 6.5 one super ball to release @entity123 in the first - half but found it difficult against an effervescent @entity12 midfield			0
@entity123 - 6 should have done better when through on goal in the first - half and struggling to recapture the brilliance of his performances for @entity132 from last season			2
@entity134 - 5.5 a few flashes but he needs to start doing more to justify the fee that brought him from @entity138 to @entity139			0
@entity140 - 7.5 magnificent piece of skill to set up @entity1 goal			1
drifts in and out of games but capable of decisive moments			2
@entity1 - 7.5 tireless up front and produced a calm finish when @entity23 needed it			1
still ca n’t help but feel his talents are wasted as a lone frontman			0
@entity88 ( for @entity90 , 16 ) - 4.5 skewed clearances , one hit against @entity12 forward @entity97 , and a lot of flapping from set - pieces			0
@entity0 simply must buy a goalkeeper in january			1
@entity160 ( for @entity100 , 45 ) - 6 @entity23 improved after @entity160 arrived in the second half			1
good shift at centre half and used the ball well			0
@entity165 ( for @entity140 , 73 ) - 6 goal ruled out for offside .			2

@entity1 scored the only goal of the game for @entity23
@entity0 praises @entity1 for his finishing in win at @entity10
@entity23 have now picked up four points from their last two games
