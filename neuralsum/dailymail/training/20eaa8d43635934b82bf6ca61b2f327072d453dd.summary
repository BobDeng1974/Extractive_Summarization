by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:41 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 22:41 est , 17 july 2012 as fury grows over a report that @entity4 helped to cover up child sex abuse claims against @entity6 , one company is going above and beyond to make sure a statue of the late @entity10 football coach is no more			1
a plane was spotted over @entity12 on wednesday towing a banner that read ' take the @entity14			2
' the banner referred to a monument to @entity4 , who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year at the height of the sex abuse scandal			1
demands : the banner referred to a monument to @entity4 , who coached the team for nearly 50 years before he was fired in disgrace last year taking flight : the banner appeared over the @entity12 on wednesday , as furor grows over @entity4 's role in covering up the @entity6 scandal the bronze sculpture bearing @entity4 's likeness has been sitting in front of @entity30 since 2001			1
the @entity31 reported that the company that operates the plane , @entity34 , is no stranger to controversial messages			2
the @entity37 grounded a plane from the @entity40 , @entity41 - based company after it towed banners taunting @entity43 during the @entity45 golf tournament			1
those banners read : ' @entity43 : did you mean @entity47 ? ( in reference to the golfer 's claim that he was turning to @entity51 to help him get through his cheating scandal ) ' and ' sex addict ? yeah			1
me too ' statue : the bronze sculpture bearing @entity4 's likeness has been sitting in front of @entity30 since 2001 @entity59 , who said he was the one flying the plane , would not name the person or group who funded the ad , telling the paper : ' i advertise			1
i believe in freedom of speech			0
' @entity10 spokeswoman @entity66 told the @entity31 that the university was aware of the high - flying banner , but were powerless to stop it			1
ms @entity66 told the paper : ' any restrictions would , of course , have to come from the [ @entity37 ]			0
there 's not much action we can take related to this expression of opinion , but we are monitoring it			0
' an independent investigation led by former fbi director @entity80 released a report last week that concluded @entity4 and other top @entity10 officials hid @entity6 's abuse to shield the university from bad publicity			1
@entity4 died of lung cancer on january 22 , less than three months before he was dismissed from the @entity10 sidelines for good			1
the new revelations about @entity4 have led to intense public backlash against the former coach , whose firing was once widely thought to be unfair			2
also on tuesday , the group that runs the parking area dubbed ' @entity93 ' where students camp out for tickets before games has stripped that title and changed the name to ' @entity100			0
' the @entity10 student group that manages the newly - renamed fan area said that their decision would help â€˜ return the focus to the overall team and the thousands of students who support it			2
' on its website , they chose to remain diplomatic in their reasoning , saying that ' since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as coach @entity4 had , changing the name for each new coach would be impractical			2
' the most significant change , however , may be yet to come as the president of the @entity119 says he is n't ruling out the possibility of shutting down the entire @entity10 football programme in light of the @entity6 case			1
getting rid of all traces : since a scathing report which detailed how much former football coach @entity4 ( pictured ) knew about the child sex scandal , his name is being pulled from much of the school in a @entity132 interview on monday night , @entity119 president @entity130 said he does n't want to ' take anything off the table ' if the @entity119 determines penalties against @entity10 are warranted			1
mr @entity130 said he 's ' never seen anything as egregious as this in terms of just overall conduct and behaviour inside a university			0
' he added , ' what the appropriate penalties are , if there are determinations of violations , we 'll have to decide			0
' the last time the @entity119 shut down a football program with the so - called ' death penalty ' was in the 1980s , when @entity149 was forced to drop the sport because of extra benefits violations			2
legacy : @entity4 was heralded around the campus for years , but now the @entity119 is debating shutting down the football program entirely in the wake of the report after the @entity119 suspended the @entity149 program for a year , the school decided not to play in 1988 , either , as it tried to regroup			1
' this is completely different than an impermissible benefits scandal like [ what ] happened at @entity149 , or anything else we 've dealt with			0
this is as systemic a cultural problem as it is a football problem , ' mr @entity130 said			0
' there have been people that said this was n't a football scandal			0
well , it was more than a football scandal , much more than a football scandal			0
it was that but much more			0
' we 'll have to figure out exactly what the right penalties are			0
i do n't know that past precedent makes particularly good sense in this case , because it 's really an unprecedented problem			0
