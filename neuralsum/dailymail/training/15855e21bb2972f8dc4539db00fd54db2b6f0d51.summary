by @entity0 @entity1 wants the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen			1
the former comedian has been engaged in private discussions with @entity8 , the culture minister , and senior broadcasting figures , @entity11 , the @entity13 director general and @entity14 , the chief executive of @entity15 , to discuss what he sees as a problem			1
@entity1 has been campaigning on the issue for six years and is hopeful change is imminent			1
he said : ‘ there will be a call to arms			0
nothing happens without conflict and this is our time to stop moaning to ourselves and to take the argument public			2
’ campaigner : @entity1 wants to see more diversity on television a meeting called by mr @entity8 for 50 tv industry figures , including @entity1 , has been brought forward			1
@entity1 wants the public to force politicians to make the change			1
he said : ‘ all of those people in the audience who watch those shows and complain that there are n’t enough black and @entity41 [ people ] , and gay and women and people with disabilities and transgender … they need to start lobbying , to start writing letters , they need to start emailing			1
‘ at some point soon there ’s going to be a campaign and we want everybody to get behind it , write letters to parliament , write letters to government , write letters to your mp and say we think it ’s time there was a change			2
’ @entity1 , 55 , is now probably best known to television audiences for advertising a chain of budget hotels			1
he first came to the public 's attention in 1975 when he was a teenage impressionist on the @entity15 talent show @entity67 , hosted by @entity68			0
he delighted audiences with his impersonations of , among others , @entity72 's @entity72 and @entity56 mp , author and tv dog food salesman @entity74			2
@entity1 then worked on the @entity76 sitcom @entity77 and joined @entity78 on @entity79			1
in the 1980s , @entity1 was given his own show by the @entity13			1
he later starred in the @entity13 sitcom chef but his television career has waned in recent years and his most regular appearance is on hotel adverts			0
the authoritative website imdb.com has no television credits for him this year and only two for 2013 , both on chat shows			0
once a tv regular , @entity89 first came to public prominence on the @entity68 - hosted talent show @entity67 ( right , seen impersonating @entity72 ) in 1975			2
he is now best known to television viewers for advertising a chain of budget hotels he claims that black and ethnic minority people should have money ring - fenced to make specialist programmes			1
@entity100 , the founder of the tv collective , an organisation developed to ‘ support visible diverse talent in the @entity104 creative media industry ’ , said that if @entity1 ’s plan is not acted upon then minority groups should consider boycotting the @entity13 ’s licence fee , if plans to decriminalise it come to fruition			1
she said : ‘ you can not continue to invest in something you do n’t get anything back from			0
if there ’s not something on the table after those talks and @entity1 ’s paper has not been acted on , the stance we would be taking is to launch a campaign to start boycotting the licence fee			2
the question is “ are we getting value for money ? ” – maybe it ’s time we stopped paying the licence fee			2
’ ‘ the issue of ethnic diversity is a really hot one in broadcasting at the moment , ’ said @entity128 , the editor of @entity130 magazine			2
‘ if the licence fee is decriminalised then the @entity13 is going to have to work harder to ensure that it does represent every single kind of person , faith and group in the @entity104 to make sure they and their lifestyles are reflected			2
’ @entity1 , who made a speech on diversity in television at @entity144 last month , said that while he is not advocating non-payment of the licence fee , added : ‘ it ’s a move is n’t it ? ’ he said : ‘ there ’s a degree of black and @entity41 eyeballs that are moving away from terrestrial television			1
broadcasters should be worried about that			0
’ @entity155 mps @entity153 and @entity8 , the culture secretary : he told @entity157 : ' more must be done to improve the numbers of people from black , @entity41 and minority ethnic backgrounds working in film , tv and the arts ' he also said he had been encouraged by his talks with mr @entity8 and broadcasting bosses			1
‘ when i met @entity11 at the @entity13 he said “ let ’s talk at the end of april ” , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity11 wants to be seen as leading from the front and the @entity13 needs to lead from the front because they ’re the main game in town			0
if the @entity13 decides they are going to do something everybody ’s going to follow			0
’ last night , mr @entity8 told @entity157 : ‘ more must be done to improve the numbers of people from black , @entity41 and minority ethnic backgrounds working in film , tv and the arts			1
industry leaders need to be more accountable for driving up the numbers employed in their sectors			0
' i met leading figures from the industry in january to facilitate a discussion on what can be done to break down the barriers that still exist			2
i look forward to hosting a follow - up roundtable before the summer to see what progress has been made			1
’ when approached by @entity189 , the @entity13 said that since the matter concerns the whole industry and not just the corporation , it would not be commenting on @entity1 's remarks			1

the sixth and seventh floors – home to top executives such as £ 244,000 - a - year @entity203 controller @entity204 and £ 247,000 - a - year head of drama @entity206 – were refurbished with scenes and sets from the corporation ’s top shows such as @entity212			0
the @entity213 submitted a @entity215 request and learned that the decorating , which took place in december last year cost £ 60,000 per floor			0
@entity13 director general @entity11 at @entity196 in @entity219 : six months after the building was opened by the @entity198 , the corporation spent £ 120,000 decorating two floors that house the offices of highly paid executives @entity13 staff said that the old look did not inspire them to create great programmes			0
a corporation spokesman insisted that costs were kept to ‘ an absolute minimum by recycling and reusing fixtures , fittings and furniture whenever possible			0
’ he added that the move was part of an overhaul that ‘ will deliver savings of £ 67m a year by 2017			0
’ the revelation comes on the heels of criticism by @entity13 star presenter @entity242 in @entity243 that the corporation is ‘ smug ’ and he detests much of its output @entity242 said : ‘ it is smug			0
i love the @entity13 in many ways , but at the same time it has made me loathe aspects of it , and that ’s a very odd state of affairs			0
‘ when i see people being given £ 1million merely for walking out of the door , when i see £ 100million being blown on that [ digital media initiative ] thing , a stupid technical initiative like that , i start wondering : how much longer are we going to test the public ’s patience ? ’ @entity242 's comments make him the third high - profile @entity13 employee to take the corporation to task , hot on the heels of @entity264 and @entity265 .			1
