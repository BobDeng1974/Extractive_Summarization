they look like exquisite vases made of finely - blown glass , placed carefully on a pedestal to receive the admiration of gallery visitors			1
but in fact these colourful images are not precious artefacts preserved for the ages , but show a split - second in which specially - manipulated liquids are captured in fantastic formation			2
they are the work of @entity16 photographer @entity15 , 55 , from @entity17 , who developed a special formula for the liquids himself			1
split - second : the images could be mistaken for intricate glasswork , but are actually split - second snapshots of liquid in motion art : @entity16 photographer @entity15 , 55 , took the images , created on pedestals , after viewers said that his pictures look like they could be valuable works of art alien : these images , part of the @entity35 , look almost alive the accomplished images require a camera with an extremely fast shutter speed to capture properly , and also requires artificial dyes to go in the water , and custom - built machinery to spray the liquids into the correct shapes			1
one of his projects , entitled ' gallery ' was prompted by viewers telling him that his images looked like solid glass sculptures - and that if they were real they would buy them			2
he decided to set up a series of the fleeting formations on top of pedestals , so that the shapes and colours would look as much like solid artefacts as possible to onlookers			2
mr @entity15 said : ' someone told me that if my work were actual sculptures , they would buy them			1
disembodied : these delicate formations only last a second before being lost bursting into colour : mr @entity15 uses special dyes to create the dramatic contrasts seen in images such as those above @entity72 : these two formations look almost like jellyfish ' i decided to set the image up to make it look like it was in a gallery - used pillars and pedestals and played on the idea that the liquid was a sculpture			1
' mr @entity15 has been working on his technique for three years			1
he originally began taking commercial photographs of coffees , cocktails and milkshakes , but now focuses on artistic images			0
he said : ' i accidentally discovered the unique formation of liquids and i thought i 'd push it a bit more			0
' i realized it was completely unique within the world of splash art photography , and i wanted to take it to a new level			0
' mr long @entity15 creates these beautiful images in his garage , and outdoors , and it sometimes spends months experimenting with new techniques , which have led to several other projects			1
development : mr @entity15 took commercial photographs of beverages - like coffee , milkshakes and cocktails - before machinery : for this set , called @entity113 and taken near his home , mr @entity15 created a special machine to squirt the liquid , which could work while submerged in the water his ' @entity113 ' series was created in a river near his house , and features dramatic formations emerging from the water			1
he said : ' i had the idea for @entity113 in the back of my head			0
i thought it would be neat to have them coming out of the water			0
' i had to build an apparatus below the water surface that was water tight so that i could shoot the water into the air and capture it			2
it was quite a challenge			0
' for another series , ' @entity132 built a fountain that would continuously flow in an arch over the exploding liquid forms			0
' i really enjoy creating these images because i 'm working in uncharted territory			0
it makes it that much more wonderful			0
' i do n't know what it will look like when i 'm beginning - it 's always rewarding when i see good results			0
