many are thought to have been wooed by the @entity53 's message that a vote for independence would mean @entity5 would no longer be ruled by @entity69 @entity43 ministers sitting in @entity38			2
now , in a speech at @entity71 in @entity72 , mr @entity36 will make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the no vote			0
