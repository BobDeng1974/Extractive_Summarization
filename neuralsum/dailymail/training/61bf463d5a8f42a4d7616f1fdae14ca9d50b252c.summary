evidence emerged on monday that president @entity2 's transition team was notified five years ago that @entity5 medical centers ' official wait - list times bore little resemblance to reality and were sometimes denying military heroes critical health care			1
the @entity10 discovered through a @entity11 that waiting times at veterans ' medical facilities were known to be wildly inaccurate at the end of the @entity17 administration			2
by the time @entity2 's transition team got a post-election briefing from the @entity21 at the end of 2008 , scheduling failures were already reaching a critical point			1
' ' this report and prior reports indicate that the problems and causes associated with scheduling , waiting times and wait lists are systemic throughout the @entity32 , ' the briefing said			2
' that was also the @entity36 's excuse today for not acting to improve veterans ' care sooner the @entity57 and other veterans advocacy groups are hopping mad about an under - the - table waiting list scandal that appears to have cost dozens of lives in just one @entity64 medical center suicides : psychiatrist @entity67 told @entity68 on monday that she believes a @entity69 @entity32 ? s appointment system was so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives @entity2 's transition team was told that nine of the va inspector general 's recommendations from 2005 to 2007 had not been implemented			1
' although @entity32 has recognized the need to improve scheduling practices and the accuracy of wait times data , no meaningful action has been taken to achieve this goal today , ' officials said			0
the briefing stopped short of saying managers and @entity21 hospitals were lying about wait times , while admitting that they were manipulating the data they sent to officials in @entity92			2
@entity36 press secretary @entity35 wound up with egg on his face monday as he told reporters that president @entity2 first learned from a tv news report that his @entity5 was denying medical care to vets with secret off - the - books - waiting lists			1
a @entity104 reporter asked @entity35 on monday when the president was ' first made aware ... of these fraudulent lists that were being kept to hide the wait times ' at @entity21 medical centers			1
' you mean the specific allegations , ' @entity35 asked , ' that i think were reported first by your news network out of @entity113 , i believe ? ' ' we learned about them through the reports			1
i will double check if that is not the case			0
but that is when we learned about them and that is when i understand @entity122 learned about them , and he immediately took the action that he has taken			0
' @entity2 has come under fire before for saying he was made aware of scandal - worthy shortcomings in his own administration by watching television , including the @entity43 tea party - targeting scandal that rocked @entity92 12 months ago and the @entity133 saga that has tainted his @entity134 for years			1
after the @entity133 scandal broke , @entity2 responded to national outrage in an interview broadcast by @entity104 's @entity139 on october 12 , 2011 , similarly saying he was out of the loop until he turned on his television			1
' there have been problems , you know , ' the president said then			0
' i heard on the news about this story that – @entity133 , where allegedly guns were being run into @entity149 , and @entity150 knew about it , but did n't apprehend those who had sent [ the guns ]			2
' a few months into his presidency , @entity2 's @entity36 approved an unannounced @entity156 flyover by @entity157 , with a fighter jet following closely , in order to capture a photograph of the iconic plane over the @entity162			1
some buildings were evacuated and emergency phone lines were jammed as panicked @entity156 feared a terror attack was imminent			0
' it was a mistake , ' the president said on april 28 , 2009 , the day after the flight			0
' it was something we found out about along with all of you			0
and it will not happen again			0
' last year on may 14 , @entity35 told reporters that @entity2 had learned about his @entity134 seizing two months ' worth of @entity178 journalists ' phone records ' from news reports yesterday , on the road			1
' ' we do n't have any independent knowledge of that , ' @entity35 insisted			2
that punt came just one day after @entity2 himself told the @entity92 press corps during a joint press conference with @entity189 prime minister @entity188 that he was in the dark – until it hit news reports – that the @entity43 had targeted conservative nonprofit groups for special inquisitions when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
' i first learned about it from the same news reports that i think most people learned about this , ' he said in the @entity200 of the @entity36 on may 13 , 2013			1
' i think it was on friday			0
and this is pretty straightforward			0
' ' i 've got no patience with it , ' @entity2 said moments later			2
' i will not tolerate it			0
and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this			0
' human face : this month @entity212 veteran @entity211 was buried in @entity213 , @entity214			0
his widow @entity215 , third from left , believes the @entity5 health system should have done more to help him as he struggled with @entity217			0
he was shot to death by one of their children in april after he threatened to kill the entire family in 2011 @entity2 told @entity104 that he first ' heard on the news about & @entity133 , where allegedly guns were being run into @entity149 , and @entity150 knew about it ' the president told reporters in 2009 that he found out along with reporters that his administration has approved an unannounced @entity157 flyover in @entity156 that spooked commuters and lit up 911 phone lines with terror - attack fears @entity36 adviser @entity233 told sunday morning talk show audiences the following weekend that @entity2 was first informed ' when it came out in the news			1
' a year later , accused @entity43 targeting instigator @entity237 has been held in contempt of @entity240 and her fate rests with attorney general @entity242			2
a criminal investigation in the @entity134 , which has issued no findings , is being managed by an attorney who donated thousands of dollars to @entity2 's political campaigns			1
@entity2 's reputation for using the news media as his own coal - mine canary reached comic proportions that week when ' @entity252 ' host @entity251 carped that ' i would n’t be surprised if president @entity2 learned @entity255 had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television			1
' some @entity258 are fearing déjà vu as the @entity21 medical scandal gathers steam			1
' this is becoming a pattern , ' a senior @entity258 @entity263 aide told @entity266 on monday			0
' the president supposedly learns about it while channel - surfing , tells us how outraged he is , and then what ? buries it ? ' @entity5 secretary @entity273 is under fire as his agency 's health system seems to be coming apart at the seams and the @entity36 claims it did n't know ' that might wash with the tea party , but not with veterans			1
no one around here is inclined to let that happen			0
' the @entity5 briefing given to @entity2 's transition team after his first presidential election victory warned specifically that its own medical appointment scheduling practices were putting lives in danger			1
' this is not only a data integrity issue in which [ @entity32 ] reports unreliable performance data , ' the transition report read ; ' it affects quality of care by delaying – and potentially denying — deserving veterans timely care			2
' it also recommended a series of tests that would compare doctor appointments in veterans ' official medical records with appointment times recorded in the @entity21 's computer system			1
as the @entity21 scandal gathers momentum , doctors are beginning to put a human face on the tragedy			2
dr. @entity67 , a whistle - blowing psychiatrist , told the @entity68 on monday that she believes a @entity69 @entity32 where she once worked had an appointment system so dysfunctional that at least two veterans took their own lives			2
bureaucrats , she said , ' do n't really experience what the doctors and nurses are experiencing , which is the suffering and the pain and the death			0
' @entity67 explained that her patients often had to wait months for follow - up appointments after she prescribed antidepressant medications that require check - ups after 10 days			0
some could n't wait out their psychological pain and committed suicide			0
@entity327 @entity326 resigned on friday a day after telling a congressional committee that he was aware of a 2010 memo warning about the problems , which materialized in a @entity64 , @entity21 medical center when as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting critical care			1
computer records indicated that the vets were not on a waiting list at all			0
@entity35 hinted monday that @entity2 is likely to address the new scandal			2
' i 'm sure you 'll hear from him at some point on this issue soon , ' he said .			0

@entity21 medical centers stand accused of *keeping* secret off - the - books waiting lists in order to boost performance stats
as many as 40 veterans died in @entity113 when they were denied critical care because their names did n't appear on official waiting lists
a report emerged on monday showing the @entity21 warned president @entity2 's transition team about the secret waiting lists after the 2008 election
yet , @entity36 press secretary @entity35 says president @entity2 did n't know about the *explosive* @entity5 scandal until he saw recent news reports
@entity2 and his *surrogates* have claimed he learned of several other scandals from broadcast or print news stories
they include @entity133 , the @entity43 's targeting of tea parties and a @entity134 seizure of two months of @entity178 phone records
