a new face stole the pre-match attention and sold the shirts , but by the end not many here had words about @entity6			1
the thoughts , no matter how fleeting they might be , were all about the reserve striker who suddenly , unexpectedly struck gold and hit @entity10 for four			1
@entity12 , if you prefer			0
at the @entity17 , in the competition of the same name , he had his moment			0
this is a 21 - year - old who last season , his first in @entity23 football , played 14 games across the competitions and scored none			1
he was often off the pace			0
cut to this fixture and he opened with two poor misses			0
by the end he had upstaged @entity6 , who appeared after 75 minutes , and had typified a strange result with a delightfully unexpected performance			1
subs : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			0
goals : @entity35 26 , 44 , 45 +1 , 49 , @entity37 40			1
@entity10 : @entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity73 85 ) , @entity74 ( @entity75 85 ) , @entity76 ( @entity77 85 ) , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 60 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 57 ) , @entity83 ( @entity84 19 ) , @entity85 , @entity86 ( @entity87 60 ) , @entity88			2
subs : @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93			0
for @entity42 , only so much can be drawn from a pre-season match , particularly when the opposition , not matter how gilded , roll over like @entity10 did			1
but quite aside from the sight of their new £ 30million striker making his non-competitive debut , they had a number of positive performances to consider			2
of the established guard , @entity58 was superb while the game was still up for grabs ; next to him @entity60 also looked sharp and @entity37 , a first - half scorer and provider , likewise			1
perhaps most promising was the early contribution of @entity51 , the 19 - year - old they signed from @entity110 in 2011			2
he bombed on from right - back , created chances and always looked confident			0
not much can be said about his defending because @entity10 did not present enough of a challenge in that regard , so for the same reason @entity115 will have to wait for greater tests			2
of the tests @entity10 did offer , @entity42 coped extremely well			1
and this against a side that ordinarily is not too shabby , a club that took a domestic treble last season and came within a penalty shootout of winning the @entity124			0
they can play and in @entity74 they have a forward who has drawn significant interest from @entity129			0
gunner come on : @entity6 made his debut after replacing @entity37 in the second half more to come : @entity6 leads an @entity42 attack on his debut getting shirty : @entity6 was greeted to huge cheers from the @entity42 crowd after coming on it was @entity74 who rattled @entity42 within the first 10 minutes yesterday			1
@entity78 had overlapped from right - back and pulled back a cross from the byline to @entity74 , who connected cleanly but saw his half - volley hit the bar			2
that was about as good as it got for the @entity143 in an abysmal first half			0
@entity42 had already been harshly denied a penalty for a shove on @entity37 by the time @entity35 missed a couple of good chances			1
first , @entity58 scooped the most exquisite of passes into his path after 15 minutes , only for the 21 - year - old , goalless in 14 games last season , to slide and make a hash of the finish			2
moments later he stabbed wide a cross from @entity51			0
his breakthrough was nice , though , coming from a backheel flick after @entity58 tricked and then outpaced two down the right before firing a low cross			0
four - midable : @entity35 celebrates after scoring his fourth goal on target : @entity37 built on his impressive @entity164 after scoring for @entity42 new partnership ? @entity35 and @entity37 celebrate an @entity42 goal in front of fans defensive debut : @entity115 made his @entity42 debut in central defence after joining for £ 12million from @entity172 @entity37 was given a huge welcome ahead of kick - off , returning after a loan spell at @entity176 and a fine @entity164 with @entity177			1
he is believed to have been mentioned in discussions among @entity180 ’s scouting department , but his performance here will not have done much to convince @entity34 that he should be offloaded			0
he initially struggled on the right to draw possession , but after switching to the left he showed his knack for finding space			0
it was from the left that he scored @entity42 ’s second , arriving late to volley another excellent delivery from @entity51			1
@entity37 missed a chance for a quick second when he shot wide after a delightful passing move , sweeping the pitch from right to left , but he played a key role in @entity42 ’s third			1
one for the future : @entity51 impressed at right - back for the @entity200 @entity62 ’s shot was saved and @entity35 scuffed the rebound , before @entity58 chipped to @entity37 on the left			1
the forward had space and a sight of goal but instead played a lovely , controlled volley across the six - yard box to @entity35			2
it was a tap - in at the end of a nice move			0
@entity35 ’s hat - trick goal , which like his second was scored in first - half stoppage time , was scrapped in after yet another @entity10 defensive error			1
@entity35 got his fourth shortly after the restart , pouncing when @entity221 , poor old @entity221 , spilled @entity58 ’s shot into his path			0
@entity10 did pull one back when @entity74 bundled in after @entity42 failed to deal with a long throw			1
by that point @entity82 , the former @entity227 flop , was on the pitch and drawing sarcastic applause ; when @entity6 came on he drew a huge roar			2
he did n’t score , but he did n’t need to .			0

@entity11 scored four goals as @entity42 romped to *victory*
@entity37 grabbed @entity42 's other goal in easy @entity41 win
@entity6 came on as a second - half sub to make his @entity200 debut
@entity242 scored @entity10 's *consolation*
