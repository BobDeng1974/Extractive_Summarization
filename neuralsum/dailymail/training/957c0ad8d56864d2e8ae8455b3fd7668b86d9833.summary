by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 14:53 est , 7 january 2014 a woman recovered the diamond from her £ 18,000 engagement ring two days after her @entity5 swallowed it			2
@entity6 , a trainee police dog , chewed up the family heirloom on december 23 after @entity8 put it on a side table while she manicured her nails			1
before she knew what had happened , @entity6 spat out the mangled gold band and swallowed the jewel			1
found : @entity8 waited with @entity6 for two days until her diamond emerged mrs @entity8 , 51 , from @entity15 in @entity16 , said : ' it must have winked at him			1
i went to the kitchen , came back and it was gone			0
' the civil servant , who looks after police puppies while they are being trained , scrambled around the floor with husband @entity26 but the other half was nowhere to be found			1
' my husband and i emptied the entire room bit by bit which took hours , ' she said			2
' i could only conclude that @entity6 had eaten it			2
' the vet said because a dog ’s stomach is so intricate it was unlikely i would get it back			0
' but she was not prepared to give up			0
' as a dog walker you always keep your pet ’s poop in a bag so i took it home and sprayed it with the hose pipe and sieved it every single day - four times a day at least , ' she said			1
she spent @entity46 waiting and finally , in the third lot of mess , it emerged			0
' i had almost given up , so it was the last shot			0
disaster : the band was found mangled on the floor and the jewel nowhere to be seen on december 23 ' i thought it was futile			1
' but the sun was shining , and there it was			0
' @entity6 was unharmed by his ordeal and is now just four weeks from being assigned a police handler			1
the ring was one of five @entity8 left out , including her gold wedding band , but none are worth anywhere near as much			1
the grandmother - of - one , who has been looking after police dogs for the past 18 years , said : ' it 's got tremendous sentimental value so i 'm delighted to have it back			2
' it 's absolutely mangled at the moment but i 'm going to get it reset and insured as soon as possible			0
' i 've had dozens of police dogs but i 've never had one who likes to snack on jewellery			0

police dog @entity6 spat out gold band but diamond vanished on december 23
vets told @entity8 , 51 , and husband @entity26 it would not emerge
