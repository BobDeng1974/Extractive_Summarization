until recently , the dazzling visual effect caused by helicopter blades hitting sand and dust - and creating mesmerizing halos described as ' one of the most beautiful things you 'll ever see in a war zone ' - had no specific name ; observers would simply marvel at the breathtaking sight without an understanding of what was causing it - or what to call it			1
now , however - to honor the memories of two soldiers killed in the war in @entity19 - the physics that create these types of breathtaking halos has a name : the @entity24			1
the effect is named after @entity27 ranger @entity26 and @entity29 soldier @entity28 , and was given its title by photojournalist @entity31 - who was covering the war and captured the effect in dozens of photos - as a way to honor the fallen soldiers			1
pretty : until recently , there has been no name for the halo effect that occurs when a helicopter lands in the desert dust : rotors slicing through dust clouds help create the halo effect that occurs when helicopters land in the desert @entity47 : to honor slain soldiers who frequently viewed the halos , a war photographer named the effect after them heroes : corporal @entity26 , left , and corporal @entity28 , right , were both killed during combat in @entity19 in 2009 @entity26 and @entity28 were killed in combat in @entity55 , @entity19 , in july of 2009			1
at the time of their deaths , the two men were just 22 and 21 years old , respectively			1
@entity26 was born in @entity59 and enlisted in the @entity27 straight out of high school , working his way up to the rank of corporal in just three short years			0
he completed two tours of duty in @entity66 prior to his fateful tour in @entity19			1
@entity28 hailed from @entity68 and joined the @entity29 army in 2003			1
he , too , rose to the rank of corporal , and had previous deployments before the tour in @entity19 that ultimately took his life			2
the stories of the two soldiers are n't dissimilar from many members of the armed services , and like most soldiers deployed in @entity19 , the two men likely would have been witness to the stunning halos in the night sky that came with helicopters heading to - and - from various missions			1
beautiful : the @entity24 has been described as ' one of the most beautiful things you ¿ ll ever see in a war zone ' tragedy : the effect seen here was named after two men killed in battle in @entity19 in 2009 @entity94 : metallic dust spins of the blades of helicopter to create the cyclonic appearance to honor the two men - and other brave men who , like them , spent countless nights escaping the horrors of war in the beauty of helicopter halos - @entity106 dedicated the effect to them			1
until recently , what caused the @entity24 was n't entirely understood			2
one pilot told the photographer that the halos were ' a result of static electricity created by friction as materials of dissimilar material strike against each other			0
' other theories were that the extreme speed of the blades moved dust particles so fast that they burned up like meteors in the atmosphere			0
science blogger @entity125 at @entity126 , however , explains the effect as the result of ' when a helicopter descends into a sandy environment , the enormous downward thrust from the blades inevitably kicks up a cloud of sand			0
' cutting through the sand and dust , the blades smash into millions of these tiny particles , each sandblasting metal from the blade			0
most of the time the only visible consequence to the helicopter is pitting on the blades , with enough damage warranting replacement			0
every so often , however , the metal blasted from the blades produces a miniature meteor shower			0
' frequent sight : most soldiers in combat zones witness the @entity147 frequently @entity148 : metal from the wing 's abrasion strips turns into a fine dust when it collides with sand and rocks from the ground combat : the beauty of the @entity147 is a welcome escape from the horrors of war he goes on to explain that , to prevent deterioration of the blades , they are often coated with an abrasion strip , typically made of metals like titanium and nickel			2
' this abrasion strip can handle a lot of wear and tear , but the desert is a harsh environment , ' @entity125 explains			0
' @entity176 is harder than the titanium or nickel that makes up the abrasion strip , so when a helicopter ’s blades begin cutting through a cloud of sand , the particles hit the blades and send bits of metal flying into the air			0
' those bits of metal come in a cloud of pyrophoric ( flamable ) particles , which ultimately burst into flames , thus causing the wondrous @entity24			2
though beautiful , this effect is dangerous as it can blind the pilots ' night vision gear			0
on truly dark nights a helicopter can land nearby and not be seen , but if the @entity24 kicks in , then it suddenly becomes a more obvious target for enemy fire .			2

the @entity24 was named in honor of two soldiers - one @entity29 and one @entity202 - who were killed in @entity19 in 2009
the dazzling photos were taken by a photojournalist who covered the war , and who *decided* to start calling the halos the @entity24
when the two soldiers died , they were just 21 and 22 years old
