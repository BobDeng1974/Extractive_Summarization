@entity13 , 22 , attends the @entity14 and apart from her name does n’t share a lot in common with the 18 - year - old high school student who has hit the headlines this week			1
the two girls do n’t especially look alike and have different colored hair , but that did n’t stop the @entity22 having her @entity24 account bombarded with hate - filled messages intended for the @entity11 teenager			1
he set another hearing date for next month on her way to a sorority chapter meeting on monday evening , @entity22 was surprised to find that she had 200 pending ‘ follow ’ requests for an account that she had previously only used last year when she was running for homecoming queen			0
very quickly her @entity24 was filled with abusive messages from people she did n’t know and who were mistaking her for someone else			2
‘ at first , i thought , “ what the heck ? ” ’ @entity53 told the @entity54			0
‘ i was more disturbed at the online bullying going on			0
regardless , this girl 's only 18			0
i could n't believe there were full - grown adults that spent their day not only stalking this girl but sending bullying messages ... i 've never been on the receiving end of anything like that			2
’ the message that @entity66 posted to explain that she was n't the infamous @entity13 of @entity11 was seen by more than 10,000 users @entity69 @entity13 , right , has posted a link to her charity walk on @entity24 after she received a load of internet trolls who thought she was the @entity11 high school student who is suing her parents , left some commenter used profanity , while others told her how terrible she was and that they wished she would get hit by a bus			1
@entity53 , who was named @entity14 homecoming queen in october , said her campaign @entity24 page had previously got about three views a day			1
by comparison , a message she posted to explain that she was n’t the infamous @entity13 of @entity11 was seen by more than 10,000 users			1
but rather than take all that negativity to heart , @entity53 has decided to put the spike in traffic to her @entity24 page to a good cause			1
in april @entity33 is set to participate in a fundraising walk for the advocacy group @entity92 and so she has posted a link to her fundraising page			1
her 19 - year - old brother , @entity95 , has asperger 's syndrome			1
' for @entity101 to turn negative attention into something so positive shows what a great person and big sister she is , ' said @entity104 , @entity54 manager for @entity92			1
boring ? @entity13 appears to yawn while listening to how her family were torn apart by her claims and behavior @entity108 claims : @entity13 attends @entity109 today in her school uniform			2
she is suing her parents @entity111 and @entity113 for ' abandoning ' her after she ran away after her 18th birthday the @entity11 @entity13 came to the world 's attention earlier this week when it was revealed that she was suing her parents to support her after she moved out of their home			1
her initial request was denied on tuesday by a judge who cautioned that the case could lead to a ' potentially slippery slope ' of claims by teenagers against their parents			2
@entity53 had sought immediate relief in the form of $ 650 in weekly child support and the payment of the remainder of her tuition at @entity133 , as well as attorney 's fees			0
state superior court judge @entity135 denied those motions but ordered the parties to return to court on april 22 , when they will present evidence and testimony on the over-arching question of whether the @entity143 are obligated to financially support their daughter			2
a high school senior , @entity53 has already been accepted by at least one college and is seeking to have her parents pay some or all of her tuition , attorney @entity145 told @entity135 on tuesday			0
dressed in her school uniform and with several friends in the gallery , @entity13 did n't speak to reporters after the hearing			0
@entity135 sounded skeptical of some of the claims in the lawsuit , saying it could lead to teens ' thumbing their noses ' at their parents , leaving home and then asking for financial support			2
blasted : the judge hearing the case took a very dim view of a voicemail rachel left for her mother			2
she told her ' i hate you ' and ' i wan na s * * * all over your face ' heartbreak : @entity113 and @entity53 broke down in tears as details of how their family was torn apart were read out publicly in @entity174 , @entity11 ' are we going to open the gates for 12 - year - olds to sue for an xbox ? for 13 - year - olds to sue for an @entity181 ? ' he asked			1
' we should be mindful of a potentially slippery slope			0
' court documents show frequent causes of parent - teenage tension - boyfriends and alcohol - taken to an extreme			0
in the filings , there are accusations and denials , but one thing is clear : the girl left home oct. 30 , two days before she turned 18 after a tumultuous stretch during which her parents separated and reconciled and the teen began getting into uncharacteristic trouble at school			1
in court filings , @entity53 's parents , retired @entity203 police chief @entity53 and his wife , @entity113 , said their daughter voluntarily left home because she did n't want to abide by reasonable household rules , such as being respectful , keeping a curfew , doing a few chores and ending a relationship with a boyfriend her parents say is a bad influence			1
they say that shortly before she turned 18 , she told her parents that she would be an adult and could do whatever she wanted			1
she said her parents are abusive , contributed to an eating disorder she developed and pushed her to get a basketball scholarship			0
phone message left for @entity222 from @entity22 at july 2 , 2013 1:18pm , submitted to @entity109 , which got the judge apparently so angry : ' hi mom just to let you know you 're a real f * * king winner are n't you you think you 're so cool and you think you caught me throwing up in the bathroom after eating an egg frittatta , yeah sorry that you have problems now and you need to harp on mine because i did n't and i actually took a s * * * which i really just wan na s * * * all over your face right now because it looks like that anyway , anyway i f * * * ing hate you and um i 've written you off so do n't talk to me , do n't do anything i 'm blocking you from just about everything , have a nice life , bye mom ' dim view : the judge denied her request for any immediate financial costs to be paid and warned @entity101 that her request would probably be turned down on the evidence she has provided so far pained : @entity101 's parents owe more than $ 5,000 on her school fees , but are refusing to pay , saying that she had ' emancipated ' herself from their care they say they were supportive , helped her through the eating disorder and paid for her to go to a private school where she would not get as much playing time in basketball as she would have at a public school			1
@entity145 told @entity135 in court on tuesday that @entity13 learned her behavior from her parents , particularly her mother , with whom she has a difficult relationship			1
