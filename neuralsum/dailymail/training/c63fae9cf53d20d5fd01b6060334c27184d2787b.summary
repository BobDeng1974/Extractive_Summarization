the fluffy tabby cat , called @entity4 , was attacked by the venomous spider in the bathroom of his home in @entity9 , @entity10			1

bitten : hades the cat was attacked by the venomous spider after chasing it around the bathroom of his home in @entity9 , @entity10			1
owner @entity11 ( pictured with twin daughters @entity24 and @entity25 ) said he is now making a good recovery the 42 - year - old said @entity4 , named after the @entity30 god of the underworld , usually lives up to his name and is ' a bit of a devil ' but she became concerned when he started acting strangely			1
she saw the feline chasing the spider in the bathroom then he leapt at it but quickly retreated and skulked back to his basket			1
she said : ' he ’s usually very active and is always out in the garden , but he was n’t interested in interacting with anybody after the bite			2
' he had a very high temperature and a very tender stomach			0
' @entity4 , who had been bitten on the face , was taken to @entity48			1
puzzled vets could n't work out what had happened as they could n't see the bite through his fur but after x-rays and tests they concluded he had been poisoned by the false widow spider bite			1
the lucky tabby pulled through and is now recovering at home with mrs @entity11 and twin daughters @entity25 and @entity24 , 13			1
she has been left with a bill of nearly £ 700 for his treatment , the @entity60 reports			1
hades : the cat spent two days on a drip after he was bitten by a false widow spider			1
he is now recovering at home but experts have warned to be vigilant and take pets to the vet immediately if you suspect they have been bitten @entity75 says although cases are rare , pet owners should be aware of the signs their animal may have been bitten , a spokesman said			1
' @entity80 for signs such as changes in behaviour , unwillingness to exercise , lethargy , lameness , swelling , loss of appetite and if your pet is showing any of these symptoms - seek veterinary attention as quickly as possible			0
she said : ' speed is of the essence and the sooner treatment can be given , the better			1
the important message is to seek veterinary attention quickly			0
' the false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in @entity102 and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise			1
earlier this month , a rabbit in south @entity108 was killed by a false widow spider bite			1
one - year - old @entity110 was found dead in her hutch which was infested with the poisonous creatures			0
humans have also suffered after being bitten by the arachnid			1
@entity115 , 66 , from @entity116 , @entity10 , is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down			0
bodybuilder @entity119 from @entity120 , @entity121 , required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since			2
@entity125 , 14 , was off school for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in @entity129 , @entity130			2
and last month @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity133 , had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there			0
poisonous : the false widow spider has been spotted across @entity102 and has caused lots of allergic reactions among humans killer : a false widow spider killed pet rabbit , @entity110 , after a nest of them infested its hutch the spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or , to some eyes , a skull			2
they have long , spindly legs and are easily confused with the black widow , a far more venomous cousin not found in @entity102			0
as with most species of spider , it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with			2
males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres , while females reach up to three centimetres			0
the first false widow is thought to have come to @entity102 from the @entity164 or @entity165 in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas			0
the first recorded sighting was in @entity170 , @entity171 , in 1879			0
according to experts at the @entity174 , the false widow is not an aggressive creature , but prod it or intrude accidentally on its territory and it will give a defensive bite			0
how dangerous that bite is , seems to depend on the victim			0
most will experience nothing worse than a short stinging pain , much like a wasp or bee sting			0
bodybuilder @entity119 from @entity120 , @entity121 , required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since but other symptoms can include numbness , severe swelling and discomfort or burning sensations			2
some victims have reported chest pains			0
others report swelling , tingling fingers and occasionally a general sense of feeling unwell and fever with symptoms lasting for a couple of days			0
advice from spider experts is to see a doctor immediately if you have an allergic reaction from a bite			2
@entity208 , secretary of the @entity209 said : ‘ try to take the spider with you so someone can identify it			2
' but do n’t , of course , touch the creature again			0
