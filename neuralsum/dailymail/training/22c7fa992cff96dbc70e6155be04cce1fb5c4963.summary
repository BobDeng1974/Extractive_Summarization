an exhibit celebrating the seventieth anniversary of @entity3 ’s @entity2 has opened at @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
‘ the @entity12 : a @entity13 ’ displays more than 40 of the @entity8 author ’s original illustrations from the famous children ’s story , which is the most - read @entity8 - language book in history			1
the @entity14 acquired the author 's works in 1968 from their original owner , @entity17 – who was a close friend of mr @entity3 during his time spent writing the book in @entity5			1
then and now : the @entity4 has displayed @entity3 's early sketches beside those that ultimately made it into @entity2 home sweet home : @entity2 's most famous image ( one which is often used as the book 's cover ) features the title character standing on his home planet , known as @entity2 @entity2 , or @entity2 as it is titled in @entity8 , has been translated in more than 250 languages since its 1943 release			1
it is a semi-autobiographical story written from the vantage point of an unnamed narrator , who crashes his plane into the @entity37 and meets a ‘ little prince ’ who hails from a small planet where he lives in solitude			0
the two embark on an endearing relationship where the prince recounts his visits through outer space over the course of eight trialing days			0
after nearly dying of dehydration , and then finding water with the help of the prince , the narrator reluctantly bids his friend adieu – unable to find him again , likely at the cause of his own hallucinations			0
the book has been praised as a classic for its sage passages that provide valuable advice to both children and adults alike			0
on top of the world : a drawing called ' the @entity63 ' was initially rendered in a more joyous form than what was published brought to life : mr @entity3 's drawing and words for ' @entity69 ' ( left ) appeared in @entity2 as it is displayed at right while the tale ’s @entity73 - born author and original language are undeniably @entity8 , it may come as a surprise to many to hear that @entity2 is actually an @entity78 - grown work			1
it reflects mr @entity3 ’s emotional two - year stay in the @entity78 during the @entity81 by drawing on an outsider ’s experiences – carefully employing the expressions of despair , loneliness , and triumph throughout its plotline			1
as the @entity4 ’s director @entity89 said in a release : ‘ the exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness @entity3 at work right here in @entity5			1
‘ one discovers the author - aviary struggling with the enormity of events impacting his native @entity101 and the world at large , while finding the focus to complete a tale as magical today as it was seventy years ago			0
’ in despair : mr @entity3 's drawing ' @entity108 ' ( left ) was rendered in black - and - white in its final version ( right ) hailing from an aristocratic family , mr @entity3 had enjoyed a successful career as a commercial and army pilot prior to his @entity78 visit			1
upon @entity116 ’s upheaval of the @entity8 government , though , he lost his position within the @entity8 @entity119			2
during his stay in @entity5 , mr @entity3 lived with his wife @entity121 on @entity122 , and later on @entity123			1
he would often write in assorted locations around the city , including the residence of his friend @entity127 , whose black poodle served as the visual inspiration for @entity2 ’s reoccurring sheep character			0
upon his invitation to join the allied forces as a pilot in 1943 , mr @entity3 decamped @entity5 just as @entity2 began to hit store shelves			1
feeling alone : in ' he laid down and cried ' mr @entity3 's consummate character is seen weeping among nature but before leaving , he unexpectedly appeared at ms @entity17 ’s door and gifted her the book ’s original manuscripts and drawings			2
the @entity4 purchased the full lot in 1968			0
it is the only handwritten draft of @entity2 known to exist today , as mr @entity3 died in 1944 ( at the age of 44 ) while on a observational military flight in the @entity101 - only weeks before the liberation of @entity146			0
the @entity4 , founded in 1906 to house @entity14 ’s private collection of books , has displayed mr @entity3 ’s original sketches beside the illustrations that ultimately made it into his consummate literary contribution			2
in doing so , the @entity14 has shown how one of the world ’s most famous stories came to fruition , on both textual and visual fronts			0
practice runs : mr @entity3 's sketches often display coffee stains and cigarette burns , which allude to the lifestyle he maintained while writing his famous book later versions : the author 's drawing titled ' the @entity166 ' begins to take shape ( left ) , culminating in its published form ( right ) but even more interesting is how the @entity4 ’s manuscripts show the intensive methods that mr @entity3 took to develop his golden - haired prince ’s precocious personality			1
original notes written by the author show a detailed analysis of the @entity2 ’s would - be vegetarian diet , outlining how his self - tended garden included radishes , tomatoes , beans and potatoes , but not fruit , as their corresponding trees would prove too large for the protagonist ’s small , house - sized planet			2
similarly discarded scratchpad stages of @entity2 ’s creation include one of the @entity4 ’s most valued sketches by mr @entity3 – an image showing the little prince wearing a yellow scarf and floating above earth , which had clearly been crumpled and thrown in the trash before being rescued , and later flattened out			0
in the thick of it : here , mr @entity3 is seen working on @entity2 at the @entity198 residence of his friend , @entity17 other treasures include the only copy of @entity2 that mr @entity3 is said to have gifted to a child			0
the author ’s military id bracelet , which was discovered by a @entity8 fisherman in 1998 , has also been put on display			2
@entity2 : a @entity13 will remain open to the public at the @entity4 through april 27 .			0
