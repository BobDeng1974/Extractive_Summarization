' approximately 2,000 people including school children were waiting for the torch to pass through , ' said @entity42 , prosecuting			0

' as well as adults there were school children and he was arrested straightaway			0
' the man 's time in the limelight was short - lived , however , as he was bundled away by officers district judge @entity60 was told that @entity9 admitted causing a public order offence due to his disruptive behaviour , but would be denying the charge of indecent exposure when the trial took place at the same court in october			1
