by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 , whose average rating for women ’s tennis is just 3,000 viewers , have rushed out a somewhat premature advertising campaign with @entity8			1
it has the @entity11 star promoting @entity1 ’s @entity13 coverage for the 2015 - 16 campaign , despite all @entity8 ’s football for club and country being screened by arch - rivals @entity19 next season			1
premature : @entity8 is advertising @entity1 's @entity13 coverage a year early on the ball : @entity8 expects to be one of the stars of the tournament with @entity11 focus : @entity8 films a @entity1 commercial advertising their @entity28 football portfolio @entity30 failure bookmakers @entity31 reached a new low with an alleged seven - figure offer to serial biter @entity33 to wear a branded gumshield in the @entity38 @entity37 match against @entity39			1
@entity31 claim they had agreed a deal with @entity33 ’s advisors before his @entity43 ban scuppered the project			1
the rabid publicists say their connection with @entity33 was made through an earlier proposed gumshield stunt on his return to football after biting @entity51 ’s @entity50 last year			2
joke : a @entity31 billboard aimed at @entity33 after his bite on @entity55 @entity56 , crowned @entity57 after finishing runner - up in the @entity59 , is under scrutiny in his role as coach at the @entity63			1
this follows the upset around @entity56 being assigned to look after @entity67 ’s highest - ranked teenager @entity66 last april — yet not being with him in the build - up to @entity70 , where his charge exited in straight sets in the first round			1
@entity56 was playing an exhibition tournament in @entity76 in the four days leading up to 19 - year - old @entity66 ’s big moment at the @entity78			1
keeping busy : @entity56 playing an exhibition match in @entity76 in the lead up to @entity70 and there is now concern whether busy @entity56 , who has media commitments and is a regular on the seniors circuit , has sufficient time to coach @entity66			1
@entity63 chief executive @entity85 said after @entity56 ’s appointment : ‘ it reflects very highly on @entity56 that he wanted to step up and take on this challenge			2
’ yet neither @entity91 nor @entity92 were too impressed with the choice of @entity56 to guide @entity66 , it is understood			1
gone : @entity66 suffered a straight sets first - round defeat by @entity97 's @entity96 an @entity63 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity56 agreed to take part in @entity76 well before he was appointed as @entity66 ’s coach			1
our performance team are working to achieve a level of continuity for @entity66 ’s coaching situation			2
@entity85 is believed to be paying @entity107 @entity106 around £ 250,000 a year — not far short of the ceo ’s own salary — to be director of player development when the @entity63 are involved in a nationwide cost - cutting process which has seen more than 30 jobs lost			0
however , @entity106 and @entity85 ’s combined wages are still less then the obscene £ 640,000 a year the @entity63 were paying former ceo @entity114			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. chairman @entity115 works only part - time for the @entity117 and was entitled to take up an invitation to @entity70 ’s @entity119 on monday			2
but somehow it seemed wrong for @entity115 to be enjoying lavish @entity122 hospitality quite so soon after @entity124 ’s footballers had let down the nation in @entity126 , with the @entity117 chief not prepared to discuss it			0
the @entity63 , who have a poor record with communications chief appointments , have once again , in their wisdom , given this crucial role to someone from outside tennis			0
there is a real need at the @entity63 for a top media operator to make the most of @entity91 ’s golden years			0
yet @entity141 , recruited from tourism agency @entity124 , is much more of a marketing specialist			0
@entity63 chief @entity85 believes marketing is key to revitalising his organisation ’s battered image			0
@entity146 , all - powerful chairman of the @entity122 , is the force behind the unnecessary policing to ensure all - white clothing regulations are enforced — even to the extent of 1987 singles champion @entity151 not being allowed to wear his signature check headband in the seniors event			2
there is also disquiet at the way @entity146 has turned the @entity119 into such a celebrity fest , particularly on the first saturday when random sporting guests receive invites despite doing nothing noteworthy of late			0
@entity146 enjoys having the stars around him , as shown by him sitting next to @entity162			0
watching on : @entity146 in the @entity119 with sir @entity163 and prince @entity164			0

@entity1 rush into premature advertising campaign with @entity8
@entity31 wanted @entity33 to wear a branded gum shield against @entity39 , but @entity38 *striker* was banned
@entity56 is @entity66 's coach , but was playing an exhibition in @entity76 in lead up to @entity70
@entity66 suffered straight - sets defeat by @entity96 in first round
