he has a number of alter egos - mr @entity3 , @entity5 - but there is no mistaking @entity8 when the biennial contest against the @entity10 rolls into town			1
the 38 - year - old seems to grow in stature in the trans - @entity15 battles , and no wonder as he has been @entity19 's leading points scorer in the last three meetings and was the team 's inspirational talisman who sparked the ' miracle at @entity24 ' two years ago			1
he has been identified by @entity10 captain @entity25 as the man they want to take down as a statement of intent and while @entity8 's form was not good enough to earn him a place outright , his selection as a wildcard was never really in doubt because he has a history of raising his game to a level rarely , if at all , seen in his individual performances			1
@entity8 ( with arm raised ) loves the @entity3 and ca n't wait for the tournament to begin on friday the @entity41 has been practicing hard at @entity42 this week prior to the competition starting on friday @entity10 captain @entity25 , pictured here with the @entity3 on tuesday , has identified @entity8 as a threat ' as someone that has loved the @entity3 i take @entity25 's comment as a huge compliment , ' said @entity8			1
' i 'm very proud of my record and proud that i 've put a lot of blue on the board			0
' i 'm passionate as a team player to be mentioned with the likes of @entity58 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 ( @entity61 ) and those players is an absolute honour			0
' i 'm not sure whether i transform ( in a @entity3 ) but i love it and i enjoy what it stands for and i embrace that			2
' my record in the @entity3 is exceptional and my stroke play record is n't , so quite clearly i 've struggled to take what i have in the @entity3 and put that out for 103 other weeks in between them			2
' it 's hard but ( you have ) to realise that what every putt means in the @entity3 is the equivalent of winning a tournament and the emotion that goes through your body is the same as the putt that you experience on a sunday in a big tournament			1
@entity8 wears his heart on his sleeve and could n't contain his excitement during 2012 's ' miracle at @entity24 ' the 38 - year - old comes into his own at the @entity3 , and roars with the delight at @entity19 's victory in 2012 ' potentially , you 're holing lots of winning tournament putts throughout a three - day spell and sometimes that all adds up to more wins than you would ever have in your professional lifetime			1
' @entity8 enters this @entity3 , his fifth , with expectation weighing heavier than ever before on his shoulders , purely on the basis of the role he played in 2012			2
it can not be underestimated how significant his run of five birdies in the last five holes to win the saturday afternoon fourballs with @entity106 was with the @entity10 leading 10 - 4 at that point			2
that was both the beginning of the most remarkable comeback in the history of the event and the start of @entity8 's step towards @entity3 greatness			1
the wildcard admitted that he struggles to recapture his @entity3 form in other tournaments as a man not short of self - confidence the @entity41 is happy to carry the burden which will undoubtedly be on him this weekend			1
' i put enough pressure on myself leading in and i work hard to be able to deliver in @entity124 , ' he added			0
' i put more pressure on myself than the millions or billions of people who are out there wanting me to hole putts			0
' i 'm very demanding of what it is i have to do out there and deliver upon and i feel that i can manage that level within myself , because that 's what i expect to do			0
@entity8 says he is thrilled to be put in the same @entity3 bracket as the late , great @entity58 ' from all the previous @entity124 that i 've witnessed , being there from 1993 , i do n't think negatively			2
' i think positively that we are going to go out there and deliver			0
i never feel that i 'm going to go out there and think ' what if something does n't happen ? ' it 's more to the point of ' @entity144 and do the job '			0
' you do n't need to control it			0
you 've been waiting for it for a long time so you just need to grab hold of it and let it go			0
