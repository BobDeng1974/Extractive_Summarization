@entity6 , 50 , only dropped off her @entity8 @entity7 at the canine beauty parlour for a wash and brush to remove some matted fur			1

shaved off : @entity6 with her depressed dog @entity7 after a traumatic visit to the grooming salon happier days : @entity7 and his flowing fur before it became so matted the groomer cut it all off @entity7 is now only walked at night because people laugh and sneer when they see him , her owner says			1
staff at the salon had shaved off all the hair from the dog ’s body leaving just his head covered in the inch thick fur			2
when she asked the staff what had happened , she was told they had no choice and had acted on advice from the @entity40			2
@entity41 , owner of the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , explained that @entity7 had been so matted she had no choice but to call them , and shave it all off			1
@entity6 , who is also from @entity43 , says she has now been forced to stop walking @entity17 during the day due to pointing and staring from members of the public			0
furious : @entity51 ( 19 ) outside her pet grooming salon in @entity43 , @entity44 , says she followed @entity40 advice and clipped mrs @entity6 's dog @entity6 ’s daughter , @entity55 , 28 , said : ' my mum had taken him in two weeks previously and asked for a wash and brush to sort his coat out			1
' he can get very matted as his fur is so thick and he loves going in the sea and mud which can make it like it			0
' then the next thing she knew was there was an @entity40 officer knocking on her door and the salon owner had reported her			1
' my mum arranged to bring him back there and get it sorted , but when she went to pick him up all his fur had completely gone			0
sad : mrs @entity6 says @entity7 has become shy and depressed following the incident shocked : @entity7 is now only walked at night because people who seem him laugh , her owner says ' the problem areas were just his belly and slightly on his legs , so i could n’t understand why they needed to shave him completely			1
' he is a very sensitive dog and my mum said you could tell he did n’t like it , people then started pointing and staring at him as they walked home and he is now very depressed			2
' now she is forced to walk him at night because of all the looks they are getting			0
' @entity92 , 19 , said that @entity7 was so matted she had no choice but to clip his fur to the short length , as less severe blades would only get stuck in the thick coat			1
' @entity7 had been in twice before i called the @entity40 , and i had said to the owner both times that he needed to be clipped as his fur was so matted			1
' she then agreed to come in for a clip			0
i tried to use a different blade but it would n’t go through his fur , so i used a shorter one			0
' the only reason it looks so short is because it ’s a white dog , on a black dog it would n’t look so bad			0
i had to remove as much fur as i did because it was that badly matted			0
' his skin was blood red because the knots were pulling it so badly , i do what is best for the dog and their welfare and happiness			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity40 confirmed that they had received a complaint and are investigating the issue .			0
