by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 could take as many as five seats from @entity5 at the next election , a new study reveals in a devastating blow for @entity8			1
some senior @entity5 figures had counted on @entity3 eating into @entity11 support , making it easier for mr @entity8 to take power in may next year			1
but frontbenchers including @entity15 and @entity16 are among those at risk of being ousted by @entity20 's party , according to @entity21 of the @entity22			2
polls put @entity5 narrowly ahead , putting mr @entity8 on course to lead the biggest parliament if not form an overall majority			0
dr @entity21 identified the @entity5 seats most at risk from the rise of @entity3 by looking at census data as well as results in elections dating from 2010 to this year 's @entity42 and local polls			1
he took into account the ' @entity3 plus vote ' of people who backed other @entity47 parties in the euro - elections			1
labour seats which are vulnerable include shadow women 's minister @entity15 's @entity50 , constituency in @entity52			1
ms @entity15 said : ' we are a former mining community and we remember what @entity54 did to our pits , so i will be campaigning against @entity3 because we do n't want a party led by a man who wants to ' keep the flame of @entity61 alive ' in @entity50			1
' @entity5 's shadow women 's minister @entity15 is the most high profile frontbencher who is said to be at risk in her @entity50 constituency in @entity52 @entity5 mp @entity66 in standing down in @entity67 , where @entity3 has selected former @entity11 candidate @entity68 to fight the seat @entity70 defence minister @entity16 , in @entity71 and former minister @entity72 in @entity73 are both at risk			1
@entity67 is a key target for @entity3 , which has selected controversial former @entity11 candidate @entity68 to contest the seat			2
and @entity78 , where @entity3 came second in a by - election in 2012 , could also be lost by @entity5 , dr @entity21 suggested			1
he told @entity80 : ' @entity5 is divided about how seriously it should take @entity3			2
those in @entity8 's team who cling to the misguided view that @entity20 's party is not a threat should look at the @entity5 seats that are most vulnerable to this insurgency			1
' the @entity5 seats that emerge as top prospects for @entity3 share several features ; they are typically over 95 per cent white @entity90 ; have large numbers of pensioners and voters with only gcse or no qualifications ; and in 2014 saw @entity3 win the popular vote			2
but it is the local political context that will be crucial at next year 's first - past - the - post election			0
' while many @entity5 seats have ' ideal conditions ' for a @entity3 challenge , they have healthy majorities which will be difficult to overturn , particularly where there are well - embedded incumbent mps with experience of fighting off the @entity107 , like @entity109 's @entity108 , said dr @entity21			1
he added : ' @entity3 need seats that not only have lots of receptive voters but also favourable political conditions where the vote is split across the main parties , making a third party insurgency possible			0
' at the weekend @entity5 's shadow chancellor @entity118 admitted the party can not win next year 's election unless it becomes tougher on immigration			2
in an interview with the @entity124 , the @entity122 said : ' polls in previous elections have always suggested that parties like @entity3 rise and then fall back on election day			0
' i think it would be very foolish of people to [ assume ] that 's going to happen this time round			0
' if we 're going to win the election , which i think we can , on jobs and the @entity137 and standing up for people on low and middle incomes against an out - of - touch government , then we can not look out of touch on an issue that people really care about			0
' @entity143 and @entity144 have both been forced to react to the rise of @entity3 , with the @entity147 leader ( right ) giving a speech on immigration this week the rise of @entity3 has also unnerved the @entity147 , who lost all but one of their meps in may 's @entity155 elections			1
@entity144 will tomorrow us a speech to speak out in favour of the free movement of @entity155 citizens but seek reforms to ensure that fewer @entity162 move here if more countries are admitted to the @entity165 in future			0
he will say : ' i want to be unequivocal : freedom of movement between @entity165 member states is a good thing			0
' it 's a cornerstone of @entity155 integration ; a right enjoyed by around one and a half million @entity90 citizens who live on the other side of the @entity177			0
' it is necessary in order to be part of the world 's biggest single market where goods and people can flow between nations			0
' those who wish to undo it should be careful what they wish for : the blow to @entity90 prosperity would be immense			0
' but he said freedom of movement needed reform to make it clear it was a freedom to work , not a freedom to claim benefits .			0

study finds @entity5 is also vulnerable to the surge in support for @entity3
@entity5 had assumed @entity205 were most vulnerable to the @entity47 party
@entity15 under threat in @entity50 in @entity52 , *academic* says
@entity67 , @entity78 , @entity71 and @entity73 at risk
@entity144 to give immigration speech after near - *wipeout* in @entity216 elections
