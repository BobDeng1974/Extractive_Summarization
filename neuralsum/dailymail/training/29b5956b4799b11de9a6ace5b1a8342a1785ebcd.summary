by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 7 september 2013 an insect enthusiast has been warned by police after releasing 1,000 crickets into his garden because he likes the noise they make			1
@entity8 bought the crickets for £ 40 from an online shop that sells live food for reptiles , then set them free in his garden to recreate the sounds of their @entity15 home			1
although his neighbours enjoyed the sound of the crickets , police still issued mr @entity8 with a warning because the foreign insects could harm the local wildlife			1
@entity24 poses in his garden last month with one of his crickets @entity24 released the insects because he liked the sound of the @entity30 field cricket ( pictured ) , but was later warned by police police decided that mr @entity8 , a church warden and private tutor in maths and science , had contravened the @entity36 , so handed out an @entity37			1
@entity39 @entity38 , a @entity32 wildlife officer , said : ' the man released the insects as he liked the sound they made			1
' while this sounds innocent , the introduction of animals not normally resident in the population can cause , at best , disruption to the local wildlife			1
' at worst , it can cause damage by spreading disease or creating artificial populations			2
' mr @entity8 declined to comment on his police warning , but police confirmed he had since used traps bought from a pest control company to get rid of the insects			1
@entity24 filled his garden with jet - black crickets ( file photo ) in an interview with the @entity62 last month , however , mr @entity8 said that he did n't ' did n't know what to expect ' when he released the creatures , and that he had taken to feeding them muesli			1
' the idea of keeping crickets for their songs is rooted in ancient @entity71 and @entity72 culture ' , he told the paper , ' but i did n’t want to cage them , but let them be free			2
' while his neighbours can still hear the crickets , they say it is not an issue for them			2
@entity83 , 65 , a neighbour and former city councillor , enjoyed the noise			2
he said : ' it was very loud and very cheerful and sounded like a night in the @entity15			2
' however , i would not be in favour of people bringing new species in			0
' the chirping was not set to last too much longer , as @entity91 , commonly known as @entity15 crickets , have a short life - span of just eight weeks			1
the insects ’ native habitat is tropical and sub-tropical regions of @entity97 , @entity30 , and @entity98 and they produce their distinctive chirp by rubbing their two outer wings together			0
@entity103 , curator at the @entity104 , said : ' the problem with releasing alien species is that you do not know what effect they may have			0
' they might carry diseases			0
' gryllus bimaculatus make loud chirps , but i ’m sure mr @entity8 can buy cds with cricket songs on instead			0
' purchasing large amounts of insects over the internet - like @entity24 did - is perfectly legal			1
many reptile owners use online suppliers to buy live food for their snakes and lizards			0
but releasing animals into the wild has the potential to be an offence if - as in this case - they pose a risk to the natural habitat			0
it is also legal to buy larger animals , such as a dog or cat , over the internet , though there has recently been a push for tighter regulation of pet - selling websites			0
on wednesday the @entity141 ( @entity142 ) announced a set of minimum standards of animal retailers			0
the new rules came after reports of illegal animals such as arctic foxes and marmosets being advertised , as well as a slew of deals offering to ' swap ' pets for items like mobile phones and watches			0
the new rules insist website must blacklist sellers who offer illegal breeds and species , end the practice of swapping pets for goods , and insist that sellers show they are properly licensed .			0

@entity24 , a private tutor and church warden from @entity167 , liked the sound of crickets chirping , so filled his garden with them
police gave him a warning , as the insect *influx* could damage local wildlife
some crickets are still loose in the garden - but neighbours say the noise is ' very cheerful '
