by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 23:36 est , 4 november 2012 @entity1 may once have had an empire on which the sun never set – but a study shows its true global reach was far more extensive than maps would suggest			1
throughout the ages , @entity1 has invaded almost 90 per cent of the world ’s countries			1
an analysis of the histories of almost 200 nations found that only 22 have never experienced a @entity1 assault			1
@entity1 rule : a map of the world shows in red the extent of the @entity18 in 1901 but a new study has found the @entity21 's global reach was underestimated and that almost 90 per cent of the world 's countries have been invaded by @entity1 these include @entity24 as well as @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 in the @entity28			1
the study – part of a new book , all the countries we ’ve ever invaded : and the @entity34 – comes against the background of maps which show that at its height the @entity21 ruled over almost a quarter of the world ’s population			1
author @entity40 worked his way around the countries on the globe alphabetically to see if @entity1 forces had ever strayed into each territory			2
however , only a very small proportion of his total list of invaded countries made up formal dominions of the @entity21			1
the remainder have been included if a military incursion was achieved through force , the threat of force , or by negotiation or payment			0
raids by @entity1 pirates , privateers and armed explorers have been included if they were acting on the behalf or approval of the government			2
therefore , many countries that once formed part of the @entity66 empire and seem to have little historical connection with the @entity1 , such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , made the list because of the repeated raids they suffered from state - sanctioned @entity1 sailors			1
the earliest invasion launched from the @entity76 was an incursion into @entity78 , northern @entity79 , at the end of the second century			0
@entity81 led an army , thought to include many @entity1 , across the @entity83 in an attempt to seize the imperial throne			2
the force was defeated in @entity87 at @entity88			0
other invasions highlighted in the book include that of @entity92 in 1940 after the neutral nation refused to enter the war on the @entity95 ’ side			0
military manoeuvre : @entity92 was invaded in 1940 by the @entity1 after the neutral nation refused to enter the war on the @entity95 side two - year project : author @entity40 started writing the book after his son asked him how many countries the @entity18 had invaded the invasion force , of 745 marines , met with strong protest from the @entity92 government , but no resistance			1
mr @entity40 , who has previously published books on @entity111 history , began the two - year research after being asked by his 11 - year - old son , @entity113 , how many countries the @entity1 had invaded			1
‘ i was absolutely staggered when i reached the total , ’ he said			0
‘ i like to think i have a relatively good general knowledge , but there are places where it had n’t occurred to me that these things had ever happened			0
‘ on one level , for the @entity1 , it is quite amazing and quite humbling , that this is all part of our history , but clearly there are parts of our history that we are less proud of			2
the book is not intended as any kind of moral judgment on our history or our empire			0
it is meant as a bit of fun			0
’ the only other nation which has achieved anything approaching the @entity1 total , mr @entity40 said , is @entity79 – which also holds the record for having endured the most @entity1 invasions			2
he is now asking for the public help in listing more @entity1 invasions			0
@entity144 is listed as never been invaded , but mr @entity40 believes it could have been .			0

a new study suggests the @entity21 's global reach has been underestimated
of almost 200 countries , only 22 have never experienced a @entity1 invasion
only a small proportion of invaded countries made up formal dominions
