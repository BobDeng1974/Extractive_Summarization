for the first time , swirls of warm water have been spotted reaching shallow regions of the seas around the @entity5			1
by diving beneath the ice caps , a series of 6ft 6in - long ( 2 metre ) yellow ' gliders ' with built - in sensors have been able to track the temperature and salinity of the depths of the @entity14			1
these measurements have revealed how vast eddies - or swirls of water - drive the heat into shallower waters , causing coastal ice to thaw			1
the yellow ' gliders ' ( pictured ) measure 6ft 6in ( 2 metres ) long , cost $ 240,000 ( £ 151,300 ) each and feature built - in sensors that track temperature and salinity in the sea off the coast of @entity5			1
these measurements have revealed how vast eddies - large swirls of water - are driving heat into shallower waters in the region these eddies transport the warm salty water towards the @entity5 continental shelf			1
it is hoped that the findings , published today in the journal @entity41 , will help refine ocean and climate models , so scientists can more accurately predict the rate at which ice sheets will retreat and how quickly global sea level will rise as a result			2
this warmer water is normally found hundreds of metres deep within the @entity50 , but how it reaches the shallow water around @entity5 had not been seen until now			2
the gliders were remotely controlled from @entity53 , more than 10,000 miles ( 16,100km ) away , and they sent data back via satellite mobile phone technology every few hours for two months			1
the findings confirm theories about how heat moves south , and set benchmarks to track climate change			2
each of the battery - powered gliders cost $ 240,000 ( £ 151,300 ) , and can be left for months at a time , diving and surfacing with tiny adjustments to buoyancy			1

co-author professor @entity79 , from @entity80 's @entity81 , said : ' our robots help us to build up a picture of underwater conditions by collecting data on water salinity , temperature , and oxygen levels			1
' the results have identified ocean features that could not feasibly have been studied by any other means			0
' a revolution is underway in @entity5 data			0

this warmer water is normally found hundreds of metres down throughout the @entity50 , but how it reaches the shallow water around @entity5 had not been observed until now it is hoped that the findings , published today in @entity41 , will help refine ocean and climate models , so scientists can more accurately predict the rate at which ice sheets will retreat and how quickly global sea level will rise as a result			2
a ship on the ice in the @entity14 is pictured ' this research was particularly challenging because the seawater quickly freezes to form sea ice and can trap the sea gliders , just like @entity117 's ship @entity118 was trapped in the same area 100 years ago , ' she added			1
one of the three gliders got lost during the study , but professor @entity122 said it still worked out cheaper than a similar trip in 2007 which required a ship costing $ 30,000 ( £ 18,900 ) a day , with many stops , to collect less data			2
elsewhere , 3,600 free drifting ' @entity128 floats ' have been deployed worldwide since 2000 to help monitor temperatures and salinity in the seas			2
while rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of climate change , the @entity134 satellite has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest			0
the results show that the thinning ice sheet from november 2009 to june 2012 caused local variations ( pictured ) an @entity145 satellite recently spotted an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in @entity5			0
while rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of alleged manmade climate change , the @entity134 satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest			2
the results show that the thinning ice sheet from november 2009 to june 2012 caused local variations in gravity , measured by the satellite			0
the @entity134 satellite burned up in @entity159 's atmosphere as planned in november 2013 after four years in orbit			0
during its mission it measured @entity159 's gravity in unprecedented detail , detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface			0
in the air , drones have also been used by organisations such as @entity171 to monitor ice			0
@entity173 , of manufacturer @entity175 's subsea division , estimated the firm had a quarter of a world market of 800 gliders			0
demand ' is growing in the marine research world along with small but noticeable uptake by defence and commercial operators , ' she said			0
in the @entity185 , gliders are tracking higher temperatures that are driving fish stocks north			0
' we 've moved from prototypes to the more regular use of gliders in the last year , ' said @entity192 , professor at the @entity193 in @entity194 .			0

the ' gliders ' measure 6ft 6in ( 2 metres ) and cost $ 240,000 ( £ 151,300 ) each
built - in sensors track temperature and salinity in depths of the @entity14
measurements reveal how vast eddies drive heat into shallower waters
these swirls of water are being *blamed* for causing coastal ice to thaw
gliders can be left for months , and were remotely controlled from @entity53
