he records mix ignoring him on his attempt to ingratiate himself			0
mr @entity45 notes the irony of @entity104 : ' the man who would become " the most iconic cinematic cowboy in history " was racking himself over how to make an impression on " the most iconic cinematic cowboy in history "			0

he had headed for @entity4 in the @entity113 and found menial jobs in props and stunt - work , learning techniques for horse - riding , roping , guns and fighting the biographer says of @entity3 's ' brief detour ' in front of the camera : ' it was a detour that lasted until his death			1
' @entity3 would ultimately direct just four films , including @entity129 and @entity130 , " passion projects " for him			2
but directing was not what he became known for			0
' @entity3 does not elaborate in the manuscript on why he never made directing a priority in subsequent years			1
' it was @entity19 who saw @entity3 ’s star potential			1

the feeling i would come to have for scenes and just about anything else would come from standing behind him and watching him work			0
' but another legendary director , @entity156 , was not among his heroes and , in his memoir , he takes aim at him over his direction of @entity161 : ' i had , for a number of years , blamed @entity163 - an otherwise excellent actor - for his bad performance as @entity165 in @entity161 … ' i had desperately wanted that part and was annoyed with @entity163 ’s portrayal … ' ' it was a detour that lasted until his death ' : the left picture shows @entity3 alongside @entity171 in @entity172 , 1955			1
the right picture is taken from the 1961 movie @entity174 referring to his own unfortunate collaboration with @entity156 – @entity176 – he continues : ' sitting on my horse waiting for the cameras to roll … [ i ] realized what kind of picture and performance this was going to be			0
' probably worse than @entity163 ’s as @entity165 … i finally realized @entity163 did n’t have a chance			0
