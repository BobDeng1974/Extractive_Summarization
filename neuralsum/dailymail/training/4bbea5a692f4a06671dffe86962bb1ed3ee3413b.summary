by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 10:09 est , 11 april 2012 early symptoms of @entity4 's granulomatosis are similar to the common cold a young man who thought he had a common cold had in fact contracted a rare and incurable disease and now has just a 20 per cent chance of living beyond the age of thirty			1
@entity12 , 20 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , contracted @entity4 ’s granulomatosis in december			1
it is an autoimmune disease where the body 's own immune system turns on itself after being triggered by a bacterial or viral infection			1
it affects just one in 70,000 causes inflammation of the blood vessels			2
the nose , throat , lungs and ears usually become swollen and inflamed			2
the kidneys can be involved , too , while for some people it affects the eyes and skin			2
@entity12 who dreams of a career in the film industry nearly died after being admitted to @entity32 on @entity33			1
what he thought was a common cold soon developed into a life threatening condition			2
he saw a number of different doctors and was misdiagnosed with the flu , pneumonia , meningitis and tuberculosis , before his symptoms were recognised as @entity4 ’s			1
by this point , he was practically blind and deaf , coughing up blood and running a 40 - degree fever			2
his arms were in such agony he was virtually paralysed			0
@entity12 said : ' the pain in my arms was unbearable , it felt like someone had shattered all my bones right from my shoulders down to my fingers ; i could n’t even move them			1
' i was completely delirious - i was convinced i was being chased by @entity58			0
' mr @entity12 is taking a break from university while he recovers he was put on a strong course of steroids and chemotherapy , the only treatment known to force the disease into remission			1
but he reacted badly to the medication and advice was sought from @entity70 - bused dr @entity69 the @entity72 ’s leading expert on @entity4 ’s as @entity12 underwent a life - saving plasma exchange			1
he is now out of hospital but receiving treatment at the home he shares with his parents and sister @entity78			0
but the disease has transformed the fun - loving young man who is now practically housebound and unable to see much of a future			0
he said : ' the disease never leaves you ; it could re-emerge at any time			0
' if i so much as catch a cold it could be life threatening , ' he said			0
with treatment people can recover , with the disease going into remission or at least kept in check			0
however , there is a 50 per cent chance of a relapse even with the use of immunosuppressant drugs and corticosteroids to control inflammation			0
frequent hospital checks are required as the disease can also lead to kidney failure			0
@entity12 , who has suffered complications in his lungs , has had to put his return to film studies at @entity101 on hold as a result			1
but he and his family are determined to help raise awareness of the disease and give something back to the charity which offered them support			0
@entity12 ’s mother , @entity108 , said @entity4 ’s charity @entity72 had been extremely supportive			1
she said : ' @entity72 got us through a really tough time ; when i was sat by my son ’s bedside not knowing if he was going to live or die they were there for me			0
' we want more people to know about this disease and raise awareness because if @entity12 had waited any longer for diagnosis and treatment it would have been too late			1
