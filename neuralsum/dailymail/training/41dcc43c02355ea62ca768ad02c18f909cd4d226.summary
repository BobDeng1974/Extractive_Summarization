by @entity0 the @entity1 has scrapped rules that bind countries to renewable energy targets , lifting demands that @entity6 build more wind and solar farms			1
the change paves the way for the government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source			1
@entity6 will still have to provide 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020 , but after that there will be no target			1
instead , the @entity1 as a whole will have to produce 27 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030			2
all change : @entity6 will no longer have to build more wind and solar farms after the @entity1 scrapped rules that bind countries to renewable energy targets			1
fracking can now be developed as a major energy source the policy is a defeat for major @entity35 nations including @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 which had demanded a target to drive the development of wind and solar power			2
they were opposed by @entity6 , which argued for a broad target in reducing greenhouse gas emissions , leaving individual countries to decide themselves how they would meet it			1
the @entity49 set an @entity1 - wide target of a 40 per cent cut by 2030 , but that is less ambitious than @entity6 ’s aim of 50 per cent by 2025			1
energy secretary @entity53 said the new rules provide flexibility in tackling emissions in a cost - effective way ‘ so that @entity6 consumers are n’t paying over the odds to go green ’			1
‘ this is a really good package , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s what we ’ve been arguing for			0
’ energy secretary @entity53 said the new rules ensure @entity6 is n't paying over the odds to go green he said it allowed @entity6 to use a mix of energy sources , including nuclear , wind , solar and , potentially , shale gas			1
‘ if you want to do this in the most cost - effective way , then you allow technologies to compete , ’ he said			0
‘ having a technology - neutral approach means having the market get the most cost - effective way of going green , and that is the whole premise of our policies			0
if you set rigid , inflexible targets that is likely to result in greater cost [ for the consumer ]			0
’ mr @entity53 has announced plans to build the first new nuclear power station in a generation at @entity87 , @entity88			1
the £ 16billion plant will be developed by two @entity91 companies and run by @entity37 energy firm @entity92			0
on the development of fracking , mr @entity53 said : ‘ it ’s good for @entity6 ’s energy security and it is good for our carbon footprint , because shale gas will replace liquid gas that is coming from the other side of the world			1
’ the @entity6 is currently on a building drive to meet the existing target of 15 per cent of energy output by renewable sources by 2020			2
it stands at less than 5 per cent			0
there are currently 120 solar farms of more than ten acres and the number will more than double this year			0
green taxes on energy bills will more than double by the end of the decade , according to @entity116 , one of @entity6 ’s biggest suppliers			2
@entity118 , director of the @entity119 , a think tank that is sceptical of climate change , welcomed the move			0
‘ today is a big day in @entity122 as the @entity1 has begun the gradual process of rolling back its bankrupting climate and green energy policies , ’ he said			2
the change in regulations paves the way for the government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source manufacturing leaders said the @entity1 ’s 40 per cent target in cutting emissions should serve notice that @entity6 is over-reaching itself for seeking higher cuts			1
‘ it has been clear for a while that others in @entity35 have little appetite to match the @entity6 ’s binding 50 per cent target and this announcement merely serves as confirmation , ’ said @entity139 , of the @entity140 , which represents manufacturers in the @entity6			0
he added that the target was deterring investors			0
@entity152 bodies opposed the move			0
@entity154 , head of climate and energy policy at wildlife charity @entity157 , said : ‘ today ’s announcement is at the low end of what one can consider to be a credible @entity1 response to the risks caused by climate change			2

@entity1 countries will no longer have to hit individual renewable energy targets
the targets now force the @entity1 as a whole to *increase* its renewable power
rule change allows @entity6 to expand nuclear power and develop fracking
energy secretary @entity53 says move is good for @entity6 energy security
