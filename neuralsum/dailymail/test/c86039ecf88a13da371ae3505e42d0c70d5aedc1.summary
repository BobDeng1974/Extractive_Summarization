the saviour of @entity2 football turns out to be a long - haired @entity3 who tripped @entity4 to give away the penalty that @entity6 converted in the 2002 @entity8 finals			1
@entity9 , 43 , who has long since lost the flowing locks in favour of something a little more in keeping with his managerial status , has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in @entity16 just over two years ago			1
it is not just his coaching which is admired			0
he is also becoming the manager for whom young englishmen wish to play , as exclusive research by @entity22 proves			2
@entity9 could be the saviour of @entity2 football thanks to his faith in homegrown talent the @entity3 has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in @entity16 just over two years ago @entity27 ( second left ) celebrates his goal for @entity16 alongside his young @entity30 team - mates in the week in which four of his young @entity30 players — @entity35 , @entity27 , @entity34 and @entity36 — all played for @entity16 , @entity34 has paid tribute to the impact the @entity3 has had on the @entity2 game			1
a year ago an @entity16 debut was the last thing on @entity34 ’s mind			1
after spending the previous season on loan at @entity45 and unused by @entity30 , he feared he would have to leave the club			2
‘ i was in the last two years of my contract and getting to that age when if it did n’t happen this season , i probably would look to leave , ’ said @entity34			2
but , when @entity50 was replaced by @entity9 , 23 - year - old @entity34 had reasons to be cheerful			1
‘ at the start of the season i was looking forward to it because of what the gaffer did at @entity57 and his record of bringing young players through , ’ he said			0
( left - right ) @entity34 , @entity36 , @entity27 and @entity35 celebrate in the game against @entity61 @entity34 made his debut for @entity16 against @entity61 in midweek after breaking into the @entity30 team this season which managers have the most faith in young , @entity2 talent ? the @entity22 looked at @entity68 clubs in the past three years ( since the start of the 2012 - 13 season ) to see where homegrown talent was getting the most opportunities to play			1
after counting the amount of @entity68 starts handed out by each manager to @entity2 players aged under 23 , the percentage of each manager ’s total starting selections shows that @entity9 ( below ) , of active bosses , backs young talent most			1
this table shows the top 10 and bottom six managers ( out of 42 ) , showing their total player selections and games , and the percentage of all starters who fit our ‘ young and @entity2 ’ criteria			1
and three @entity91 managers make up the bottom three			0
@entity9 ’s record of sticking by @entity2 players such as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , and backing youngsters such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 in the @entity57 first team , struck a chord with @entity34 and his peers			1
the @entity3 is a godsend for @entity107 chairman @entity106 , whose commission is attempting to find ways to nudge more managers into playing their young @entity2 players rather than rely on often mediocre , imported talent			1
‘ he is honest and picks the team on how you ’re training , ’ said @entity34 of his manager			1
‘ and if you are in the team and doing well then you ’re staying there			0
it ’s brilliant for young players as he gives you that opportunity			0
’ @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 were quick to congratulate their team - mate @entity27 on scoring @entity16 ’s spectacular equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity61			1
only @entity36 is not from the @entity30 academy , having joined from @entity128 at 19			2
@entity34 ’s girlfriend , @entity129 , has had a copy of the @entity132 celebration photo framed for his living room			2
another man who enjoyed @entity9 ’s support may soon be joining those four in the @entity16 squad			1
@entity137 , 20 , who scored the winner for @entity140 against @entity141 on monday and who should be a key player at the @entity143 this summer , is likely to be promoted to the senior squad when that tournament in the @entity146 is over			0
@entity101 ( right ) of @entity57 could be another to soon join them in the @entity16 squad @entity16 boss @entity148 admitted 20 - year - old @entity137 is another player currently in their thoughts @entity34 ’s parents missed his @entity16 debut as high winds caused their flight to @entity61 to be cancelled			1
they made a failed last - minute dash to get to the match via @entity141 but did n’t make it to @entity132 in time			0
@entity30 ’ @entity34 , who plays at @entity158 today , said : ‘ they were devastated			1
’ ‘ we like him , ’ said @entity16 manager @entity148			1
‘ we ’ve kept our hands off him simply because of the @entity140 but we know he ’s a big prospect and the moment he comes back from the @entity146 he ’ll be very much in our thoughts			0
’ @entity34 believes more youngsters would come through if managers were willing to take a chance on the likes of him			1
‘ the @entity168 and @entity169 are not better than us technically , ’ he said			0
‘ but they get given the opportunity younger in their league , so they get the chance to come and play in the @entity68			0
i understand there is a lot of pressure on managers to get instant results			0
but @entity2 players know the league			2
and there is plenty of talent out there			0
if @entity2 players can start coming through it will benefit our national team			2
’ it should also benefit the clubs , especially the elite			0
with the majority of the world ’s best players emerging from @entity198 , @entity169 and @entity141 , those players are likely to aspire to play for @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
@entity68 clubs can not expect to match those @entity204 giants unless the @entity2 game produces a foundation of top talent			1
but @entity22 research demonstrates just which clubs and , more importantly , which managers are prepared to take a risk on young @entity2 talent			1
the acid test is whether a manager will start a player in a @entity68 game			0
using that criterion and then listing which managers have started with @entity2 players under the age of 23 in the past three seasons , @entity9 emerges as the champion of the @entity2 among current @entity68 bosses			1
@entity225 @entity224 did his bit during his admittedly unsuccessful time at @entity228			0
but two @entity230 managers , @entity231 and @entity232 , also feature high in our league table , as does northern irishman @entity235 and , perhaps surprisingly , @entity238 @entity237			0
@entity224 did his bit for homegrown development during his unsuccessful time at @entity228 former @entity241 boss @entity231 also did before his dismissal at the @entity243 when the figures are broken down club by club , @entity57 , @entity247 and @entity248 are top of the league , with @entity91 bottom			0
in fact , @entity91 have not started an under 23 player qualified to play for @entity16 since @entity254 and @entity255 played on the last day of the 2011 - 12 season against @entity257 , a few months before they turned 23			2
because of the lack of @entity2 youngsters available to them , @entity91 managers @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 are bottom of the managerial table			2
perhaps the emergence of @entity267 , on loan at @entity269 , or highly rated @entity270 will change that next term			0
@entity267 is currently on loan from @entity91 at @entity143 side @entity269 @entity270 is another player impressing at @entity16 youth level in @entity91 's setup the irony is that @entity91 have the best youth set - up in the country , having won the @entity279 three times in the past five years — and they are in the final again this year			2
@entity282 is also near the bottom of the managerial table			0
@entity285 , now at @entity286 , is the only @entity2 under 23 @entity282 has ever fielded during his time at @entity288			0
but the issue is clearly more complex than simply pointing the finger at foreign - owned , big - spending clubs			0
@entity292 , owned by one of @entity16 ’s most passionate supporters in @entity295 , are near the bottom of the table , as is @entity299 manager @entity298			2
so quite where @entity34 and his like would be without @entity3 support is open to question			1
@entity9 , it appears , is already doing more to change the culture of @entity2 football than any commission or directive .			1

@entity9 has gathered a considerable reputation in @entity16
@entity30 boss brought through the likes of @entity35 and @entity34
the @entity3 manager is a godsend to @entity107 chairman @entity106
