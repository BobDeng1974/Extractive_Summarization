@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 delivered a highly cautious assessment on saturday ahead of the next round of nuclear talks with @entity5 , citing ' important gaps ' in the way of a deal before an end of march deadline			1
at a news conference in @entity12 , where he attended an economic discussion , @entity0 also said a @entity1 decision would come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the @entity12 government			1
three days before @entity19 's election , @entity1 's top diplomat expressed hope that any government voted into power ' meets the hopes for peace ' in the @entity25			2
he said he 's returning to nuclear negotiations with @entity5 with ' important gaps ' standing in the way of a deal but on the @entity35 administration 's most important foreign policy priority - talks with @entity5 to curb its nuclear program - @entity0 was circumspect			1
he said only a negotiated agreement could provide long - term assurance that @entity39 would not develop nuclear weapons			1
but with a deadline just two weeks away , he could not say whether the @entity1 and other world powers would be able to reach a framework accord with the @entity5 or even were close			1
' we have made some progress but there are still gaps , important gaps , and important choices that need to be made by @entity5 in order to move forward , ' @entity0 told reporters in the @entity53 resort of @entity28			2
' the purpose of these negotiations is not just to get any deal , ' he said			0
' it is to get the right deal			0
' speaking after a week of @entity1 political fighting over the diplomatic outreach to @entity5 , @entity0 lambasted @entity62 republicans who signed an open letter to @entity5 's leaders suggesting any deal they reach with the administration could expire the day president @entity35 leaves office			1
such tactics , which @entity0 called unprecedented , will inevitably raise questions among @entity5 and @entity1 's allies in the talks , he said			1
he said that in order to provide long - term assurance that @entity39 would not develop nuclear weapons , more negotiations need to occur the conflict between the administration and mainly @entity61 in @entity78 has emerged as among the tensest subplots to the diplomatic effort			1
because @entity1 lawmakers can block the lifting of some penalties against @entity5 and potentially pass additional trade or financial restrictions , they hold the power to undermine an accord			2
they are pressing for at least a say in whether any deal the @entity1 and its partners reach is acceptable			2
negotiators are talking about freezing @entity5 's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the @entity5			0
many in @entity78 say the @entity1 should hold out for greater dismantlement of @entity5 's nuclear infrastructure			1
but opponents of a deal have been vague about what types of continued nuclear activity - if any - they would deem acceptable			0
' what 's the alternative ? ' @entity0 asked			0
' in previous years when @entity1 policy was not to talk to @entity5 and insist at the same time that they can have no nuclear program , whatsoever , the number of centrifuges skyrocketed			1
every time negotiations have broken down in the past , @entity5 's nuclear program has advanced			0
' negotiators are talking about freezing @entity5 's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the @entity5 @entity0 , who was schedule to travel sunday to @entity121 , @entity122 , for several days of discussions with @entity5 foreign minister @entity124 , noted the @entity126 's longstanding claims that it has no interest in assembling a nuclear arsenal			1
its leaders have issued a fatwa , or formal religious ruling , against such weapons			0
the @entity1 , he said , has ' great respect for the religious importance of a fatwa '			0
but negotiators need an agreement that translates that commitment into an agreement that can ' guarantee that @entity5 's program will be peaceful now and peaceful forever '			0
' we still do n't know whether or not we will get there , ' @entity0 said			0
' it may be that @entity5 simply ca n't say yes to the type of deal that the international community is looking for , but owe it to the future of everybody in the world to try to find out			0
' on @entity12 , @entity0 said a decision would come ' very soon ' on @entity154 fighter jets , tanks and other materiel the @entity12 say the need to combat an extremist threat operating in the @entity159 and spilling over from lawless @entity160			1
@entity0 said at the conference that negotiations with @entity5 can not stop , because ' every time negotiations have broken down in the past , @entity5 's nuclear program has advanced ' the aid was suspended after the military 's 2013 takeover of the government			1
the @entity1 administration considers its resumption critical for @entity25 stability , but must first certify @entity12 progress on human rights , democracy and the rule of law , or issue a declaration that such aid is in the interests of @entity1 national security			2
ahead of @entity19 's national election tuesday , @entity0 emphasized how @entity181 and @entity61 alike have sought peace between @entity19 and @entity183 for decades			0
the @entity1 is hopeful that ' whatever the choice the people of @entity19 make , ' peace efforts can resume			0
@entity0 said he did not want anyone to misconstrue his comments as interference with the vote			0
@entity35 's relationship with prime minister @entity192 reached a new low earlier this month when the @entity19 leader sharply criticized @entity1 policy on @entity5 in an address before the @entity78			2
@entity0 said he could only repeat @entity1 ' hopes that the choice that the people of @entity19 make will not only meet their needs domestically and their hopes in their country , but obviously meet the hopes for peace which i think everybody shares			2

@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 said only a negotiated agreement could provide long - term assurance that @entity39 would n't develop nuclear weapons
he said he could n't say if @entity1 or other nations could reach a framework with @entity5 before the end of the month
but he said a decision will come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the @entity12 government
