‘ hi - ho , hi - ho , it ’s off to work we go … @entity4 ! ’ that ’s definitely not in the script of @entity9 classic @entity7 but it ’s something that visitors to @entity12 in @entity13 are going to be hearing a lot of			1
for , after a lengthy hiatus , @entity15 finally has a new roller coaster , the @entity18 , and @entity19 was one of the first to try it out			1
a runaway train ride , the steep drops and sharp bends are as terrifying as the wicked queen but considerably more fun , while inside , the walls are studded with more than a million ‘ diamonds ’ as well as a tableaux featuring @entity7 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity7 , @entity31 , happy and @entity7			0
totally terrifying : @entity9 's @entity33 was so much fun , @entity32 had four goes while the @entity18 is the big new attraction , @entity9 has been busy behind the scenes at its @entity38 resort and as a result , there ’s plenty to be found in @entity38 that you wo n’t unearth in @entity43 or @entity44 , including an extended @entity46 theme park			1
home to the @entity51 and the @entity52 ’ @entity49 , it might , on the face of it , be for children but that does n’t mean the grown - ups ca n’t get involved			2
100ft drops ( the @entity51 ) , being shot forward at 90mph to the sound of @entity60 ( @entity59 ) or shooting chipmunks in a mobile shooting gallery ( @entity63 ) , there ’s plenty to enjoy			0
indeed , i loved the @entity65 so much , i went on twice			0
but the resort is n’t all terrifying twists and hairpin bends			0
for those in search of something gentler , @entity15 ’s stable of child - friendly rides - the @entity18 notwithstanding - makes it perfect for tiny tots			1
hairpin bends : a ride on the @entity18 includes plenty of sharp bends and a seriously steep drop @entity80 : inside , the ' mine ' has been kitted out with ' diamonds ' and enthralling animated dwarves still around : the parade might have changed a little but classic characters such as @entity86 and @entity87 remain enchanting : @entity88 , which includes the @entity89 , boasts several new rides along with the pretty @entity91 and the iconic @entity89 , the newly revamped @entity88 is a small girl ’s dream come true			1
once you ’ve finished getting your kicks on the @entity18 ( i managed a record four goes on this one ) , there ’s a series of gentle new rides to enjoy , among them @entity102 : the @entity103 , which conveys you through @entity105 ’s watery kingdom in pink plastic clamshells with a glimpse of @entity108 the only scary part			1
then there ’s the @entity112 ride which , if nothing else , should get younger readers clamouring for a copy of the @entity117 classic , and a traditional carousel complete with beautifully decorated prancing horses			0
away from @entity88 , the @entity121 experience has also had a revamp ( more @entity123 , much more ! ) , while back on @entity91 , @entity9 has launched a new parade to coincide with the unveiling of the new look @entity88			2
called the @entity127 , it includes all of the old favourites – @entity86 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity87 among them – as well as some eye - openingly clever new additions			2
i loved the 53ft long fire - breathing steampunk dragon that glared balefully at the children in the crowd as it sailed past , as well as @entity139 of @entity142 fame ’s vast set of mobile bagpipes			1
but while the new parade , @entity88 and the @entity33 have been gobbling up most of the headlines , i found myself enjoying some of the quieter spots such as the beautiful @entity148 area and @entity149 far more			2
the latter is the largest and least well - known of the four theme parks that make up @entity12 , which , incidentally , covers an area larger than @entity153			1
here you ’ll find the @entity155 , an experience that ’s billed as seeing the animals as they really live but in reality is just as disneyfied as everything else , and a petting area where you can get your hands on everything from ponies to chickens			0
top attraction : @entity149 's @entity168 rollercoaster is one of the best in the entire resort disneyfied : the @entity173 ' safari ' experience is fun but ca n't hold a candle to the real deal much more exciting are the @entity177 , a souped - up log flume that sends you spinning beneath waterfalls and zig - zagging through a series of rapids , and my favourite , @entity168			2
with several seriously steep drops and a gorgeous view of the park from the top , as well as a stomach - churning section where you shoot backwards , @entity168 is as good as anything offered by @entity15			1
indeed , so brilliant is @entity168 , i managed a record five goes			0
fun though @entity168 is , it ’s the @entity18 that ’s likely to end up with the longest queues – much to the irritation of those who ca n’t bear waiting in line			1
lucky then , that @entity9 has also launched a convenient new gadget called @entity199 , a new wristband system that lets you book fast passes in advance and go shopping without having to carry a credit card around			2
usefully for those of a more forgetful bent , it also contains your park tickets			0
i used mine for multiple goes on just about everything and spent approximately five minutes queuing at the @entity212 – the attraction that , for some reason , had the biggest lines on the day i went			0
with no lines to worry about , it left me with much more time for whizzing about on the @entity18 and @entity218 - an old favourite that i could n’t resist revisiting for a second ( and third ) goes			1
seven nights at @entity12 with @entity221 starts from £ 4,636 for a family of four ( £ 1,559 per adult and £ 759 per child )			2
the price includes scheduled flights with @entity226 from @entity227 direct to @entity13 , accommodation at the @entity9 ’s @entity229 on a room only basis , car hire and @entity9 ’s 7 - day ultimate ticket			1
@entity234 is per person based on two adults and two children travelling and sharing a woodview room , including all applicable taxes and fuel surcharges which are subject to change			0
@entity234 is based on a departure on 3rd december 2014			0
start your holiday before you ’ve even taken off in the v - room at @entity227 - adults £ 22 , kids £ 12			0
