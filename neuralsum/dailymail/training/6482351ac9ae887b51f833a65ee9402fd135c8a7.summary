@entity1 film producer @entity0 has apologized for comments he made in some of the many emails he wrote that have been leaked over the past few days as a result of the @entity8 hack			1
' private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity , even when the content of them is meant to be in jest , can result in offense where none was intended , ' said @entity0			2
' i made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny , but in the cold light of day , they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all			1
to anybody i ’ve offended , i ’m profoundly and deeply sorry , and i regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused			0
@entity56 also issued an apology on thursday , saying ; ' the content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who i am			1
' she then added , ' although this was a private communication that was stolen , i accept full responsibility for what i wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended			0
' on the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the president at the home of @entity48 ceo @entity47 , @entity56 and @entity0 went over things she could discuss with @entity33 while at the event in october 2013			1
' should i ask him if he liked @entity78 ? ' @entity56 asks @entity0 , a reference to the 2012 @entity81 film @entity82 that dealt with the subject of slavery in the @entity85			1
' 12 years , ' responds @entity0 , referencing another slavery film , this time @entity89 's 2013 @entity88 - winning work @entity90 , a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in @entity95			1
the pair then keep going , listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name , including @entity99 and two @entity101 movies , @entity102			1
' i bet he likes @entity101 , ' says @entity0 at one point			2
racist response : @entity0 suggests that @entity56 maybe talk with the president about 12 years a slave ( above ) not good : the email exchange also finds @entity0 commenting that president @entity33 ' likes @entity101 ' this all come just one day after @entity0 called @entity34 ' a minimally talented spoiled brat ' in emails discussing who would direct her upcoming remake of the classic film flop @entity116			1
@entity34 had wanted the director @entity117 to helm the project , while @entity0 wanted to use him on a @entity120 biopic he was developing			2
in the end , @entity117 passed on both			0
@entity0 previously gave a statement to the @entity123 about the hack earlier this week			2
' this is not about salacious emails being batted around by @entity128 and @entity129 , ' the disgraced producer said on wednesday			0
' it ’s about a criminal act , and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals			0
' burn : @entity0 called @entity34 ( above with @entity56 ) a ' minimally talented spoiled brat ' in one email in demand : @entity34 and @entity0 both wanted to use @entity117 ( above ) on their film projects in other leaked emails , these having to do with the @entity120 biopic , screenwriter @entity141 has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film , @entity147			1
' i do n't know who @entity147 is and the rest of the world is n't going to care , ' @entity141 tells @entity56 when informed of the studio 's desire to cast the actor , who also starred in 12 years a slave			1
one man who is clearly a fan of @entity147 however is producer @entity158 , who says of the @entity160 actor in one email , ' he just makes you feel bad to have normal - sized genitalia			0
' the emails formed part of the november 24 cyber attack on @entity53			2
as for the fundraising event , which took place last november , president @entity33 did indeed talk about the film industry , saying : ' believe it or not , entertainment is part of our @entity95 diplomacy			2
' if they ’re watching an old movie — @entity177 , the @entity178 , or @entity179 and @entity180 — they ’ve had a front - row seat to our march towards progress			0
even if their own nations have n’t made that progress yet			0
' according to public records , @entity56 donated $ 5,000 to president @entity33 's re-election campaign and gave a further $ 30,800 to the @entity189			1
@entity33 made no mention of the films @entity82 , 12 years a slave , @entity99 , @entity193 in his speech at the event			1
response : @entity101 posted his response to the emails on @entity199 also on thursday , @entity101 took to his @entity199 to respond to an email conversation between @entity56 and @entity201 in which he was called a ' greedy whore ' for demanding more money to promote on of his films on social media			1
' knowing your self worth is extremely important people , ' wrote @entity101			0
' i worked very hard to get where i am today			0
i look at myself as a brand and because of that i will never allow myself to be taking advantage of			0
i own my brand … i make smart decisions for my brand …			0
i protect my brand …			0
which is why i ’m able to brush ignorance off of my shoulder and continue to move forward			0
