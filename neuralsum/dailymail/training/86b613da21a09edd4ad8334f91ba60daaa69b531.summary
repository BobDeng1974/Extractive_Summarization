after spending more than 200 years entombed in a cramped cellar - @entity1 's oldest yacht has been given a new home			2
the @entity4 , built in 1791 , lay in her original boat cellar on the @entity6 for a century following the death of her first owner @entity8 - before being rediscovered in the 1930s			1
in a painstaking operation , the historic 26ft vessel was moved to a purpose - built climate - controlled conservation facility this week , in the hope that it will continue to survive the test of time			1
she is also the only surviving shallop - a light boat used for rowing or sailing in shallow water , typical of the 17th and 18th century			2
@entity38 , the organisation responsible for protecting and promoting the @entity6 's heritage and culture , have now transferred her from the cellar within the @entity43 in @entity44 , to a storage unit in @entity46 on the @entity6			0
following a 24 - hour delay due to high winds , the 18th century relic was lifted by cradle and then crane , and transported to the recently - purchased climate - controlled conservation facility			1
18th century relic : the vessel lay in her original boat cellar on the @entity6 for more than a century following the death of her first owner @entity8 moving home : the @entity4 has been has been moved to a purpose - built climate - controlled facility , also in the @entity6 influential : the yacht 's first owner , captain @entity8 ( sketched above ) , was a co-founder of the earliest bank in the @entity6 and an enthusiastic inventor and traveller the @entity4 will now be stabilised , examined and @entity70 first owner , @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity38 , said : ' it 's been six years in the planning			1
the @entity4 , @entity1 's oldest yacht , was commissioned in 1791 by captain @entity8 , a prominent politician and banker from @entity44 in the @entity6			1
@entity8 ( 1751 - 1835 ) was a member of the @entity76 , the directly elected lower branch of @entity77 , the parliament of the @entity6 , for 51 years			1
during the wars with @entity80 from 1793 , he was an officer in successive @entity38 forces raised for @entity83 defence			0
he was also co-founder of the earliest bank in the @entity6 and an enthusiastic inventor and traveller			0
@entity86 built the vessel her own cellar - where she lay for more than a century after his death			2
she was rediscovered in 1930 , underwent repair work and has since been carefully conserved in her cellar on the @entity6			1
' we 've done a lot of work in preparing the boat , supporting it with a steel cradle and readying the @entity8 's dock so that it could accept the boat when we took it out of the cellar that it had been sitting in for 200 years before finally preparing the whole thing for lifting and transportation			2
' the main reason that we 're moving her is that her fixings have been consumed by rust and we need to arrest that			0
' the @entity4 is a highly significant vessel and the progenitor for any yacht you ' ll see in any harbour in the world			0
' it is one of the most important objects that we are responsible for on the @entity83			0
' after her rediscovery , structural repair work was carried out during the late 1940s when the vessel was repaired by local craftsmen			2
this involved the replacement of the keel , stem post and two planks , all of which were damaged when she lay on her starboard side			0
the @entity43 will now undergo partial redevelopment and refurbishment to improve the entrance and shop area with a new ' @entity134 ' , telling more of the personal story of @entity8 and his family as well as the @entity4			0
painstaking operation : the boat is hauled up in the shadow of @entity140 in the south of the @entity6 conserved : after her rediscovery , structural work was carried out during the late 1940s when the vessel was repaired by local craftsmen recent archaeological investigation and archival research has established that the site was home to possibly the earliest slipway in the @entity150 , and that @entity8 subsequently replaced this with a unique private dock , which acted as a sea lock			1
exhibits will include a number of recent finds from the 2014 excavations including a leather pistol holster , a flintlock pistol mechanism , some coconut shell drinking cups , and what is believed to be an eighteenth century microscope			0
the @entity43 will reopen to the public in may 2015 following completion of the improvement works and the gallery refresh			0
