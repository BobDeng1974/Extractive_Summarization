@entity0 has refused to relocate its lonely polar bear to a wildlife park that specializes in the species , despite a petition by more than half a million people			1
animal rights activists had been calling on the 28 - year - old animal to be moved to a zoo in @entity9 , @entity10 , over claims that it was showing signs of stress			1
but @entity14 , director of @entity15 , said tuesday that the bear , named @entity17 , is too elderly to make the nearly 6,000 - mile journey			1
' @entity17 is close to his caretakers			0
we just want everyone to stop bothering the bear , ' he said			2
he added that the behaviors which others had highlighted as signs that the animal was in distress were merely down to his age			1
a team of vets in @entity0 ruled in february that the polar bear should remain in the zoo			1
@entity17 's plight came to the attention of animal rights advocates , who dubbed him ' the world 's saddest animal ' when they launched a petition to call for him to be moved			1
the polar bear has been alone in his enclosure since his partner , @entity55 , died of cancer in 2012			1
visitors to the zoo , and animal experts , had reported seeing him pacing nervously in his concrete enclosure , and appearing to struggle with the high temperatures			1
concerns : @entity15 officials say the bear is too elderly to make the journey from @entity0 to @entity10 alone : @entity17 is the only polar bear in @entity0 and has shown signs of depression hope : campaigners wanted @entity17 moved to @entity70 , above , which has a large plunge pool and spacious enclosure for its bears friends : @entity17 is the only polar bear in @entity0 , but if the zoo had allowed him to relocate he could have interacted with others at the @entity10 zoo , above he has been seen tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth , and rocking from side to side - all behaviors widely believed to be symptoms of stress			1
@entity84 and other environmental groups argue that it is riskier to keep the bear in @entity88 , where temperatures can reach up to @entity91 in the summer			2
the last polar bear to die in @entity0 did so during a heatwave in 2012			1
currently , @entity17 has only a shallow pool , said to be only 20in deep , to provide cooling water			0
but @entity70 in @entity9 , where campaigners wanted the bear moved , has a ten - acre facility that provides as natural an environment as possible for polar bears			1
its $ 84 million journey to @entity104 exhibit focuses on education and conservation , and the polar bears living there have more space to roam and a more natural setting			2
and , when temperatures in @entity9 get too hot for the arctic creatures , the zoo 's bears have access to a deep , rocky pool			2
the @entity118 is 21 metres long , 3 metres wide and 2.5 metres deep and , while the bears dive and splash around , visitors can watch them through a tunnel that goes underneath the exhibit			0
flat out : @entity17 sits in a concrete enclosure at @entity15 in @entity0 in temperatures of up to 104f and is said to have been depressed since his long - term friend @entity55 died two years ago observations : experts claim the 28 - year - old 's lonely life is causing him to display ' abnormal behavior ' , including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side thick coat : animal rights activists now want @entity17 - whose only access to cooling water in his enclosure is said to be a pool just 20in ( 50cm ) deep - moved to another zoo that offers cooler conditions for @entity17 , it would have been a chance to experience something closer to the wild , and to have interaction with his own species for the first time in two years			1
' his current living situation is very sad , and he deserves to be saved , ' a statement on the @entity147 petition site said			0
the petition called on @entity0 's president , @entity150 , to give her approval for the bear to be moved			1
the campaign has quickly gathered in momentum , with more than half a million supporters signing the petition by tuesday			0
it has also been given support by @entity159 politicians , including former house speaker @entity160 , who highlighted the case on his @entity163 page			0
under a video clip showing the depressed - looking polar bear , @entity164 wrote : ' if you love animals the way i do , please sign the petition to help the @entity0 polar bear , @entity17			1
' still in @entity0 : @entity172 blocked an effort five months ago to move @entity174 in @entity10 heavy : at @entity15 , @entity17 is served 33lb of meat per day , and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat			1
and if his caretakers are late , @entity17 growls to draw their attention the singer @entity182 , also backed the bear on @entity184 , posting : ‘ do n’t cry for him , @entity0 ? no tears of mrs @entity150 for tortured polar bear @entity17			1
your hands are stained with his blood when he dies			0
’ @entity190 of environmental group @entity191 , said her organization was trying to challenge the findings of the vet panel that recommended the bear should stay			2
' i saw the bear last thursday			2
he came out and he swam just a bit			0
he ’s walking very slowly , ' she said			0
' they ’ve expanded his pool but they still have yet to give him the room he needs to walk			0
' zoo director @entity14 has said that considering @entity17 's age , he was in ‘ good condition ’ , and that the life expectancy of one of the animals is just over 20 years - but in captivity , they often live to 30			1
‘ we must avoid a big mistake , like his death during the trip or upon arrival			0
one must evaluate the risks carefully			0
he is old , and this would require many hours of anesthesia , ' he said			0
sad case : @entity219 for @entity220 - has been at the zoo for two decades , and has had no contact with his own kind since @entity55 died			1
now , campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues campaign : @entity182 tweeted her support for the campaign to help @entity17 @entity84 had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer @entity17 urgently to @entity10 , which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat			1
@entity0 professor @entity234 , who teaches at @entity235 in @entity9 , has written to her government and the @entity237 in @entity238 over the issue			2
she told the @entity240 last year : ‘ you can see he is going crazy			2
he moves the way polar bears do when they are suffering a lot of stress			2
‘ he has been filmed rocking back and forth in a way that signals distress			0
it breaks my heart to see it			0
i know how hot summer is			0
there is no way for him to escape the heat			0
not going : @entity84 had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer @entity17 urgently to @entity10 , which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat ‘ he looks so sad			1
you can imagine a polar bear in the desert with a swimming pool 50cm deep			2
it ’s difficult to watch this poor animal suffering and in pain			0
’ @entity17 , a 900lb ( 400kg ) bear born in the @entity159 in 1985 , arrived in 1993 in @entity88 , a city of 120,000 at the foot of the @entity268 , known for its wine production			0
at @entity15 , @entity17 is served 33lb of meat per day , and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat			0
and if his caretakers are late , @entity17 growls to draw their attention			0
as the zoo ’s mascot , he has an air - conditioned 375 sq ft enclosure , a 5,400 sq ft beach and a swimming pool in which his guards throw blocks of ice to keep it cool			1
a spokesman for @entity172 did not immediately respond to a @entity288 request for comment .			0
