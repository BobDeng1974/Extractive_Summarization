by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 04:56 est , 3 april 2013 @entity1 will host the @entity2 every day this week , there are food shows on the telly			1
from @entity8 to @entity9 , @entity7 to @entity10 , it seems we ’ve got a gluttonous appetite for cookery on the box			1
it ’s all about recipes and ingredients , the subtleties of preparation and presentation			1
or is it ? while @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 are revealing their culinary secrets , millions of viewers are chewing over more basic thoughts : ‘ i fancy a plate of that			1
i wonder if there are any crisps left ? ’ food appeals to our deepest animal instincts			2
clothes , however , do n’t			2
the way to a man ’s heart , as the proverb says , is through his stomach ... not up his elegantly tailored shirt - sleeve			1
that ’s what dooms @entity2 to failure			1
home - made clothes do n’t answer a primal need			1
it was mildly interesting , for ten minutes , to learn about the history of pattern books and how the @entity53 skirt got its name			2
mildly interesting ; not gripping			2
eight contestants were striving to impress the judges with their sewing skills , knocking up garments from scratch against a deadline			2
the researchers had obviously struggled to find any male seamstresses , so they ’d come up with @entity63 , a fitness instructor who had never stitched a skirt before , and @entity67 , a lorry driver whose hobby was making ‘ steampunk ’ ( a futuristic take on @entity70 ) costumes for sci - fi conventions			1
easily the most impressive of the eight was @entity75 , a 75 - year - old yoga enthusiast			1
we first met her hanging upside down in the lotus position			2
she ’d been sewing ever since she started making clothes for her dolls as a child			2
historian @entity83 made the same mistake on crossing @entity85 in a punt ¿ his journey down the @entity88 had the feel of an educational programme for schools today her work is of a professional standard , but i still did n’t want to spend an hour watching her put pleats and darts in			0
judge and @entity100 tailor @entity99 emerged as a wryly mannered wit			0
holding up one blouse , he sniffed : ‘ it ’s good from afar , but it ’s far from good			0
’ and after declaring that most dress - making was the art of simple measurements , he took one look at the bustline of a well - endowed model and said : ‘ it ’s complex geometry in there			1
’ for long stretches , though , the programme was as engaging as an instructional video			0
naturalist @entity118 ¿ s infectious enthusiasm , on the other hand , lit up @entity120			0
historian @entity83 made the same mistake on crossing @entity85 in a punt — his journey down the @entity88 had the feel of an educational programme for schools			0
there were beautifully composed shots of poppies and cowslips in riverbank meadows , mallards and mute swans floating on the currents , but the commentary ignored the evocative and went straight for @entity135 facts			0
the @entity88 is 170 miles long , @entity136 recited ; it rises on @entity137 , almost 1,000ft above sea level ; @entity139 began the @entity140 in 1766 ; it requires ten pints of water to make one pint of beer ; in @entity144 during the @entity145 there were 200 ceramics factories and now there are only 30			0
what could have been a personal paean to vanishing @entity85 became a @entity151 geography lesson			0
naturalist @entity118 ’s infectious enthusiasm , on the other hand , lit up @entity120			0
when a harpooned whale dragged a wooden boat at high speed across the waves , 19th - century whalers called it the ‘ @entity160 sleigh ride ’			1
@entity118 ’s four - part documentary up the @entity163 west coast , following the grey whale migration , had that same breakneck feel			1
last night he ventured out between the ice floes into the @entity167 in the @entity168 to watch whales feeding on shrimp - like creatures called amphipoda			1
in the silver - blue water under a midnight sun , these mammals looked like sea monsters — filmed from the air , their immense bulks shone ghost - like under the water			1
@entity118 was full of facts , too — the musk ox has the longest hair in the animal kingdom , for instance — but his delivery was never stuffy : the information just seemed to burst out of him			0
in the end , this travel documentary was sheer romance , where its @entity190 rival was as dry as a school textbook			0
beyond the boundaries of one @entity195 town , @entity196 , the inhabitants had to dump heaps of whalebone and blubber , to attract the local polar bears and discourage them from wandering down the main street			0
you do n’t get that in @entity204 .			0

the way to man *'s* heart is through his stomach , not his tailored shirt - sleeve - that is what dooms @entity2
