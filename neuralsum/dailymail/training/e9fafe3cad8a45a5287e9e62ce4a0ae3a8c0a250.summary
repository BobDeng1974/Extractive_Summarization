as @entity2 hobbled into her @entity4 office one monday morning in june , her colleagues could clearly see she was struggling with back pain			1
the 44 - year - old company director shuffled over to her desk and waited for questions to be fired in her direction			1
had she picked up a large piece of furniture ? overdone it at the gym ? the real answer was slightly more embarrassing			2
' i 'd just discovered @entity16 and had been playing it for more than ten hours over the weekend , ' says the mother - of - one from @entity18 , @entity19			1
scroll down for gameplay addicted : ' i 'm thinking about it all the time , ' says mother - of - one @entity22 ' my back became strained because i 'd been hunched for so long over my @entity25			1
i could n't help it , it was so addictive			2
the extraordinary thing was that almost everyone else in the room admitted they too were addicted			1
now we 're all competing			2
' look around any busy train or bus and it seems every other person with a smartphone or tablet is hooked on @entity16 , the latest online game to have taken the world by storm			2
with its twinkly lights , hypnotic music and comic sound effects , it has millions of people in its grip - and , like 2010 's @entity46 , which even numbered @entity47 among its fans , it has become an online sensation			1
' i call it " crack candy " because i imagine giving up is like trying to break a crack habit ' an astonishing 700 million games of @entity16 are played every day on mobile devices alone , according to @entity55 , a leading authority on social media trends			1
but , unlike so many video games , it appears that instead of teenage boys and men , it 's mostly women who are in thrall to @entity16			1
according to the game 's creators , @entity65 , women aged between 25 and 55 are the demographic most loyal to the game			1
' @entity16 is one of those gender - neutral games that has a " moreish " quality that can fit in flexibly around a woman ’s life , ' says professor @entity74 , director of the @entity75 at @entity76			1
it takes up all your cognitive ability because you have to concentrate on it 100 per cent			2
' that means you can forget about everything else for a few minutes , ' he continues , ' which is appealing to many women - whether you 're a stay - at - home mother who has ten minutes to play it in between childcare , or a business executive on her commute			1
appeals to women : candy crush is one of those gender - neutral games that has a ' moreish quality ' that can fit in flexibly around a woman 's life according to one expert ' unlike so many online games , it does n't involve killing , fighting or strong male characters or highly - sexualised female characters			1
what 's more , it 's deceptively simple and fun			1
' the rules of @entity16 are indeed simple			2
players move a variety of brightly coloured sweets - or candies - around a grid and line up at least three of the same sweet in a row			2
every time a row is completed , the line explodes , making way for more sweets to drop in			2
with more than 400 different stages , each more difficult than the last , and more being added all the time , players never need run out of challenges			2
as a so - called ' freemium ' product , basic access to the game is free , but users must pay for ' premium ' services			2
players are n't charged to advance through the first 35 levels but after that , it costs 69p for another 20 levels , although it is possible to avoid paying by asking your @entity130 friends to send you extra lives			0
however , the cost can rise as players are encouraged to buy ' boosters ' such as virtual ' candy hammers ' for around £ 1			1
' i 'll have a sneaky game or two at lunchtime			0
when i get home , i 'll leave the ironing or the housework and have half an hour - or more - on the @entity25 ' according to @entity143 , @entity16 makes an estimated £ 400,000 a day for @entity65			1
that 's £ 146m a year , figures which have prompted the @entity146 to voice concern that guidelines are needed to stop firms exploiting young users			1
@entity65 claims that 90 per cent of its players are over 21 , but maturity does n't seem to prevent women like @entity2 from falling under @entity16 's spell			1
' i call it " crack candy " because i imagine giving up is like trying to break a crack habit , ' says @entity2			1
' i had n’t heard of it until i saw that many friends - all intelligent , creative women - were playing it on @entity130			1
' she admits : ' i 've never played any other game on my phone			0
but i do n't like going a day without my " fix "			1
i play it whenever i have a free moment			0
in the morning i play on my commute and when i look around the train , nearly every other person seems to be doing the same			0
' i 'll have a sneaky game or two at lunchtime			0
when i get home , i ’ll leave the ironing or the housework and have half an hour - or more - on the @entity25			0
' but it 's at the weekend that @entity2 says her gaming becomes more of a problem			1
' once i ’ve got up and read the papers , i 'll start playing and that ’s me sorted for the next three to four hours			1
in fact , i only usually stop when my @entity25 runs out of battery			0
my boyfriend thinks i 'm mad			0
' my son @entity184 , who is at boarding school , ca n't understand my obsession			0
i 've been known to meet him off a train and rather than give him a hug i 've said : " just a minute @entity184 , i ’m just getting on to the next level ! " sour side : the psychological effect of playing is very similar to gambling ' over the past four months i 've probably spent around £ 150 playing it			0
but it 's worth it			2
' @entity196 , 37 , a bank worker from @entity197 , @entity19 is another @entity16 addict			1
she started playing only five weeks ago , but says she ’s already losing sleep over it			0
' i 'm thinking about it all the time , ' says mother - of - one @entity201 , who lives with partner @entity202			0
' i wake up and the first thing i do is pick up my phone to have a game , then i 'll be playing if i get a spare second before work			0
' i play it on my walk from the car to the office			0
when i come home , i play it while i 'm cooking the evening meal or watching tv			0
@entity202 thinks i 'm bonkers			0
when the lights go out and we 're in bed he 'll say : " i know you ’re playing it because i can see the light from your phone " so i have to play it under the covers			0
' my son asks : " why are you playing that game again mum ? " it 's as if our roles have been reversed			2
it 's taking over my life			1
i do n't know if i ’ll ever be able to stop			0
' ' @entity231 has gone to pot. i 've even been late picking my ten - year - old up from school because i 've been stuck on a level ' so is @entity16 as benign as it looks ? psychologists say that ' freemium ' games can be an insidious route to more serious gambling problems			0
' on first look , games like @entity16 may not seem to have much connection to gambling , but the psychology is very similar , ' says prof @entity74			0
' even when games do not involve money , they introduce players to the principles and excitement of gambling			0
small unpredictable rewards lead to highly engaged , repetitive behaviour			0
in a minority , this may lead to addiction			0
' @entity256 , a 40 - year - old mum of four from @entity257 , is worried that she 's addicted			1
' i 'm playing it for eight hours a day now and it 's become a real problem , ’ she says			1
' my daughter told me about it			0
i was hooked straight away			0
the longest i 've played for is 12 hours with just a few short breaks in between			2
it 's worse than smoking			2
' @entity256 says her addiction is beginning to affect family life			1
' @entity231 has gone to pot. i 've even been late picking my ten - year - old up from school because i 've been stuck on a level			0
' i 've burnt countless dinners and let vegetables boil dry because i 've been engrossed			0
i 'm trying to limit myself , but i can still spend eight hours a day playing it			1
' it seems that if they 're not careful , some players may soon find the sweet taste of @entity16 turning rather sour .			0

@entity279 has millions of people in its grip
women aged between 25 and 55 are the demographic most loyal to it
@entity2 , 44 , calls it ' crack candy ' because she 's so addicted
@entity256 , 40 , plays for eight hours a day
@entity196 , 37 , said : ' it 's taking over my life '
