by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 7 april 2012 updated : 05:16 est , 8 april 2012 a protester sparked fury yesterday by deliberately swimming into the paths of the crews in the @entity5 and @entity6			1
environmental campaigner @entity7 was hauled from the water and arrested on public order offences after his actions halted the prestigious event for half an hour			1
last night , the president of the @entity14 angrily told @entity7 via @entity15 : ‘ my team went through seven months of hell			1
this was the culmination of our careers and you took it from us			2
’ the university crews were almost neck - and - neck when they were forced to stop after the blades of the @entity5 team ’s oars narrowly missed @entity7			1
a police officer said later : ‘ they nearly took his head off			2
’ shock : @entity5 crew members gape in disbelief after @entity7 dives beneath their oars and re-emerges from the @entity35 feet from the boat incredibly , it was not the only drama to affect the 158th boat race			1
after the event restarted – the first time a restart has been required for 11 years – an @entity5 oar snapped when blades from the two teams tangled , allowing @entity46 to cruise to victory			1
then , at the finish line , a member of the @entity5 crew collapsed in the boat and had to be taken to hospital			1
the crews had set off normally enough at @entity55 , @entity56 , a little after the scheduled start time of 2.15pm			2
more than nine minutes into the race – halfway along the four - and - a - quarter - mile course , near @entity61 – former @entity63 rower and race official sir @entity58 spotted @entity7 in the water			1
wearing a wetsuit , the bearded @entity66 had plunged into the @entity35 at the @entity69 stage of the race , apparently in a protest to highlight his unorthodox political views			2
critical seconds : as the @entity5 rowers approach @entity7 only cox @entity73 sees the danger closing in : rowers react to their cox 's shouted warning			1
a police officer said the team ' nearly took his head off ' close shave : @entity7 ducks under the surface to avoid the oars before re-emerging on the other side witness @entity85 , an art dealer of @entity86 , @entity56 , said : ‘ i think he must have got there early and stayed lurking in the water , because we never saw him swim out from the riverbank			1
’ as the boats approached , @entity7 ducked under the water to avoid the oars			1
@entity5 crew member @entity95 used @entity15 to send the protester a series of emotional messages after the race			1
mr @entity95 , a doctorate student at @entity100 , tweeted : ‘ when i missed your head with my blade i knew only that you were a swimmer , and if you say you are a protester then no matter what you say your cause may be , your action speaks too loudly for me to hear you			2
‘ i know exactly what you were protesting			2
you were protesting the right of 17 young men and onewoman to compete fairly and honorably , to demonstrate their hard work and desire in a proud tradition			2
‘ you were protesting their right to devote years of their lives , their friendships , and their souls to the fair pursuits of the joys and the hardships of sport			0
you , who would make a mockery of their dedication and their courage , are a mockery of a man			0
’ exhaustion : @entity5 's @entity132 is splashed with water by team - mate @entity134 after collapsing at the finish line another blow : medics and the @entity5 rowing team aid their bowman @entity139 after he collapsed at the end of the race			1
he did not lose consciousness and is said to be in a stable condition frustratingly for @entity5 , they were enjoying a marginal advantage when race umpire @entity147 the event to a standstill			1
as @entity7 resurfaced , smiling broadly , he was picked up by a police boat			1
once on dry land , he was led away off @entity152 pier , wrapped in a red blanket			0
onlookers booed and shouted ‘ take him to the @entity155 ! ’ and ‘ is that @entity156 ? ’ – a reference to the comedian who swam the @entity35 last year for charity			0
bitter defeat : @entity5 's @entity161 is comforted after losing the 158th annual @entity5 and @entity162 on the @entity35 at @entity163 , west @entity56 police later said @entity7 was being detained at a @entity56 police station on suspicion of a section 5 public order offence , namely behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress			1
describing the drama , @entity46 rower @entity170 said : ‘ i saw a head			1
i looked over and thought they had lost a guy [ out of @entity5 ’s boat ]			1
our cox immediately said , “ stop ! ” ’ @entity5 cox @entity73 was also forced to take drastic action – quickly alerting her crew to thedanger ahead			1
remorseless : @entity7 beams as he is picked up by a police boat and led away off @entity152 pier explaining the decision to interrupt the race , sir @entity58 said the swimmer had risked serious injury			1
‘ it ’s not ideal but what could we do ? we could not have carried on , ’ he said			0
in the other incidents , the blade of @entity5 ’s @entity196 rower dr @entity197 broke after thecrews ’ oars clashed			1
the @entity5 crew member who collapsed was dr @entity132			1
the 27 - year - old @entity203 medical student was lifted from his seat by medics			0
apparently suffering from exhaustion , he was conscious , but was taken to hospital			2
he was said to bein a stable condition			0
at the end of the race , a clearly upset ms @entity209 appealed for the race to be rerun because there was too much wash on the course after the postponement			2
her appeal was turned down by the umpire			0
the 2012 race is the first to be disrupted by a swimmer			2
the last time it had to be restarted was in2001 when there was a clash of blades and an oar was lost			2
in further reaction , television presenter @entity227 tweeted : ‘ @entity229 , the monumental ego and selfishness of the swimmer who screwed the @entity6			0
imagine sharing living space with someone like that			0
’ the quick - witted @entity5 cox at the centre of yesterday ’s drama appeared in the @entity240 - winning film @entity239			1
@entity241 alerted her crew to the presence of protester @entity7 when he was just yards from their oars			1
footage appeared to show @entity247 calling out to the rowers , who were unable to see the man in the @entity35			0
she played the role of a cox in the 2010 film , which portrayed the early life of @entity255 founder @entity254 and his @entity257 peers , including the @entity259 twins , @entity260 and @entity261			0
quick thinker : @entity241 looks dejected after the race			2
her shouted warning ensured the @entity5 rowers did not hit @entity7 the twins , who won a multi-million - pound court settlement after claiming @entity254 stole their idea for his social networking site , were part of the defeated @entity5 crew in 2010			1
@entity247 , who is studying for an msc in criminal justice at @entity5 , was the only woman in yesterday ’s chaotic race			1
film role : the @entity5 team member played a cox in 2010 's @entity239 talking last week about her role , the 24 - year - old , who lives with her fiance in @entity283 , said : ‘ i was rowing with [ @entity283 ’s ] @entity284 at the time and we got word that they needed extras for a rowing sequence			2
' we filmed on the final day of the @entity291 and then spent six or seven days at @entity292 in @entity293 doing close - ups			0
‘ the director @entity296 was trying different things			0
he was attaching boats together with metal girders and putting cameras here , there and everywhere			0
it was really interesting and we got paid a little bit as well , which was nice			0
’ between takes , @entity247 sat chatting with @entity303 and @entity304 , who played the @entity259 twins			0
‘ they did a really good job and were good fun			0
they would tell us stories about their experiences and we would tell them about our lives			0
’ the filming , which took place in july 2009 , evoked fond memories for @entity247			0
her grandfather is @entity240 - winning sound mixer @entity317 , and she spent much of her childhood visiting film sets			0
‘ i was used to all the waiting around and sudden panic when something is about to happen			0
i have n’t ruled out going into the film industry			0
’ @entity247 was educated at fee - paying @entity325 ’ school in @entity56 , where she first took up rowing			0
