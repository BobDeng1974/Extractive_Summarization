@entity2 's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time , he prevented the ball from becoming live			1
@entity8 could have had a first half hat - trick against the @entity11 champions on saturday evening , as he saw two goals disallowed before finally scoring a legitimate goal			2
@entity8 powered home a header from a @entity17 cross , only to see the flag go up to deny him a fourth @entity11 goal in three games			0
it looked offside at first glance , and replays confirmed that the striker was several yards beyond the last defender			0
@entity26 was at the centre of a major controversy , but the referee got his decision spot on @entity8 heads past @entity2 , but the flag was rightly up with @entity32 several yards offside @entity8 was celebrating again just moments later , but the officials again ruled the goal out free kick inside the penalty area : direct or indirect free kick to the defending team : the ball is in play when it is kicked directly out of the penalty area if , when a free kick is taken by the defending team from inside its own penalty area , the ball is not kicked directly out of the penalty area : the kick is retaken seconds later , from the resulting free kick , @entity46 appeared to kick the ball straight to @entity32 , who smashed it emphatically past the @entity52 no 1 and began to celebrate			1
again , his joy was cut short , this time by referee @entity26 , as confusion spread around @entity55			0
again , the officials had got it right			0
@entity2 had inadvertently played the ball twice , touching it with his standing foot before scuffing it to @entity32			0

@entity2 had inadvertantly touched the ball with his standing foot before connecting with it @entity2 then scuffed his kick , but the ball had not come into play before being played twice by the keeper the ball broke to @entity32 on the edge of the penalty area , but @entity26 had already blown his whistle @entity8 powered home his second disallowed goal in a minute , but the free kick had to be retaken @entity26 correctly spotted this , and made him take the free kick again , to @entity94 's obvious frustration - but correct under the laws of the game			1
@entity8 did eventually get on the score - sheet though , finishing nicely in the 21st minute to put @entity94 1 - 0 up .			2

@entity94 striker @entity8 thought he had put his side ahead twice
