by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 6 january 2013 tribute : @entity2 unveiling one of the blue plaques for writer @entity5 in 2004 @entity6 plans to stop erecting the blue plaques that commemorate the lives of the great and the good because it can no longer afford to pay for them			1
the taxpayer - funded quango says the tributes , which have been around for more than 140 years , have ‘ an uncertain future ’ because of @entity16 cuts			1
it says it will honour existing commitments but not accept any new nominations			1
the decision is outlined in a letter to a blue plaque campaigner from dr @entity23 , head of @entity6 ’s blue plaques team			2
she said the advisory panel of experts – which includes @entity2 , former poet laureate sir @entity28 and broadcaster @entity29 – ‘ will be stood down ’			0
dr @entity30 wrote : ‘ these are extremely difficult times for @entity6 and for the scheme , which has a very uncertain future			1
’ @entity6 , whose annual budget has been cut from £ 130 million to £ 92 million , may also seek private sponsorship to try to maintain the scheme			1
the moves follows the news that the number of names considered for plaques had been scaled back , with plans to honour @entity45 star @entity44 and cellist @entity46 scrapped			2
@entity48 mp and historian @entity49 said : ‘ the blue plaque scheme has been a genuinely innovative heritage project			2
it will be an unnecessary loss and they should do everything possible to keep it going			0
' literary biographer @entity54 added : ‘ people love the plaques even if they do get steamed up about some of the choices			0
they are part of @entity61 ’s glory			0
’ scrapped : the news could spell the end for blue plaques such as this tribute to @entity66 on @entity67 , @entity68 @entity69 was the first person to be honoured when a plaque was placed on his former @entity68 home in 1867			0
that property has since been demolished			0
@entity6 , which took responsibility for the scheme in 1986 , has erected more than 350 plaques to figures including @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
the public can nominate anyone for the honour but candidates must have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth			0
they must also be regarded as eminent			0
@entity6 last night said it was committed to the blue plaques but could not consider any new proposals for the foreseeable future .			1
