fresh testimonies from a small island community in the @entity2 has reignited reports that missing @entity4 could have crashed over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by @entity7 authorities			1
locals from the island of @entity10 , located in the southern area of the @entity12 in the @entity2 , reported witnessing ' a low - flying jumbo jet ' on the morning of march 8 last year , when the flight disappeared while travelling from @entity15 to @entity16 with 239 people on board			1
the reports come as acoustic scientists from @entity20 refuse to rule out the possibility that ' distinctive ' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the @entity28			1
locals from the island of @entity10 in the @entity2 reported witnessing ' a low - flying jumbo jet ' on the morning of march 8 last year when @entity4 disappeared @entity10 is located in the southern area of the @entity12 , in the @entity2 , in the @entity28 despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of @entity34 , locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings , similar to those of the missing plane , on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the @entity4 's disappearance , reported @entity41			1
villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane , and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed			1
' i 'm very sure of what i saw on a very clear and bright day , and what i saw was not normal - the plane was very big , and low			1
i did not know until later that other people saw it too			0
i do n't know if it 's the @entity57 plane ' , said @entity58 , 34 , an it manager			0
@entity59 said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water , and did not know at the time that it could be the missing @entity63 flight			2
' i did n't know that a plane was missing			0
i went straight home and told my wife about it			0
i told my family , " i saw this strange plane "			0
this is the biggest plane i have ever seen from this island ... i have seen pictures of the missing plane - i believe i saw the plane ... i strongly felt those people who were searching should come here , ' mr @entity59 said			2
the @entity76 released a statement in march last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance , which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities			2
a local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast , and that the plane was travelling so low it 's doors could be seen			1
' i 've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before			1
we 've seen seaplanes , but i 'm sure that this was not one of those			0
i could even make out the doors on the plane clearly , ' an eyewitness told the website			2
@entity4 disappeared while travelling from @entity15 to @entity16 with 239 people on board the search for the missing plane has been headed up by the @entity107 the search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of @entity111 ' it 's not just me either , several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing			1
some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too			0
' the plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from @entity15			0
it was then tracked by @entity57 ’s military radar heading towards the @entity28			0
over the past year , the search for the missing plane by the @entity107 , headed by @entity111 , has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of @entity111			2
the location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded ' pings ' or ' electronic handshakes ' sent between @entity4 and a satellite for the final hours of it 's journey			1
the flight made a number of unexplained deviations , and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with @entity141 while flying between @entity57 and @entity142			0
as of early march 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised , but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far			0
' based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely			0
it is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare @entity4 an accident , ' said @entity57 's civil aviation chief , @entity161			2
@entity57 's civil aviation chief , @entity161 declared the crash an accident dr @entity164 ( left ) from @entity20 's @entity165 began investigating a low - frequency underwater sound signal the signal was recorded west of @entity168 using acoustic recorders ( above ) at 1:30 am on march 8 the reports from @entity10 follow information released from @entity20 that a ' clear acoustic signal ' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane 's disappearance			1
dr @entity164 and his associates from the university 's @entity178 began investigating a low - frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of @entity168 just after 1:30 am utc on march 8			1
@entity184 , along with @entity183 ’ @entity180 ( @entity181 ) and @entity182 were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search , and originally determined that the noise 's source was close to the @entity2 and @entity10			1
' data from one of the @entity194 ( @entity193 ) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of @entity4 , ' dr @entity164 said in a statement released by @entity20			1
an @entity28 sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight relatives of the missing passengers of flight mh370 visit a temple in @entity210 to pray for their family members relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that @entity4 plunged into the sea on march 24 , 2014 ' the crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds			1
' dr @entity164 said that the noise may have been due to a geological event , including a small earth tremor , but the timing piqued the interest of his research team			0
' it would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin , but can not be ruled out as being connected with the loss of @entity4 , ' he told @entity41			2
in early march , @entity57 's transport minister , @entity233 , said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of may			0
it is one year since @entity4 went missing			0
here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months			0

locals from the @entity2 island of @entity10 claim they saw a low - flying jet on the morning @entity4 disappeared
the island is over 5000 kilometres away from the *current* search area
members of the community say it was so low they could see the plane 's doors and make out the distinctive *colouring* on the side of the jet
locals made statements to verify what they had seen to officials
@entity20 acoustic scientists say they recorded ' distinctive ' noise from the area at the presumed time of the crash
