@entity0 revealed who he believes is the best player in @entity4 football ... and surprisingly it was n't his @entity7 star striker @entity6			1
in fact , the @entity7 boss confessed it is actually @entity12 talisman @entity11 who is proving to be the best in the country , following his brace and assist in his side 's 3 - 0 win over @entity18 on sunday			2
speaking with as , the 61 - year - old @entity19 highlighted just why he thinks his compatriot is the hottest property , having provided 12 goals and seven assists for the @entity25 since his £ 32million transfer from @entity27 last summer			1
@entity11 celebrates after scoring his second goal in @entity12 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity18 on sunday @entity7 boss @entity0 claimed that @entity11 was the best player in @entity4 football ' every game i see him making a great effort , showing great commitment , ambition and the maturity needed to keep improving year after year			1
' i 'm happy for him because at this time he is the best player in @entity4 football			2
' @entity0 's comments may have surprised some sections of supporters at the @entity39 - considering his very own striker @entity6 netted 14 times for his club before being hit with a knee ligament injury in december - but he could not deny the talents of the former @entity27 number 9			1
' i always thought [ he was going to be world class ]			0
the only thing you could criticise him for before was that he did n't score enough goals			0
' he was n't a scorer			0
but he has improved this a lot in the last two campaigns			0
' despite a slow start to his career at the @entity56 giants , @entity11 ended his final season at the @entity58 with 19 @entity60 goals to his name before making the switch to north @entity63			2
@entity6 ( right ) returned to action at @entity65 on saturday after a month out with a knee ligament injury ' @entity11 has progressed in recent years			2
his spell at @entity27 has been very useful for him as well as sharing a team with great players			0
' @entity70 - 18 goals , 4 assists @entity73 - 19 goals , 2 assists @entity11 - 12 goals , 7 assists @entity78 - 10 goals , 9 assists @entity6 - 14 goals , 4 assists the @entity19 international 's immediate impact in the @entity85 is certainly making him stand out from the crowd			1
the 26 - year - old 's exploits after his first 20 games in @entity4 's top flight are third only to those of @entity70 ( @entity91 ) and @entity73 ( @entity92 ) , who were directly involved in 22 and 21 goals respectively compared to @entity11 's 19			1
interestingly @entity6 sits fifth in the same standings , behind former @entity95 and @entity96 forward @entity78			0
@entity0 's comments will surely spur the @entity99 on to regain the form he showed prior to his injury after his goalless return to action on saturday when he came off the bench in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity65 .			0
