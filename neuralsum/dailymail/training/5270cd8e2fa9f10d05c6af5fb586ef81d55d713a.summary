their famous partners could not be more different - one is in training to be a future king , while the other is the first @entity5 male to win @entity6 since the 1930s			2
but the lives of @entity9 , 26 , and the @entity10 , 32 , have taken a remarkably similar path since the early noughties			1
yesterday , after nine years together , @entity9 and @entity13 , 27 , announced their engagement			1
the 26 - year - old and the @entity10 ( right ) have followed similar path in their adult lives , including long courtships before getting engaged to famous men			1
like @entity10 , @entity9 has had a style transformation into a fashion icon the couple have had one of the longest courtships in recent @entity5 showbiz history - much like the @entity30 and @entity10 , there has been constant speculation about when they would finally get hitched			1
but that is n't the only similarity between the two women			2
@entity9 has also chosen to shun the limelight , provided a rare constant in her boyfriend 's ever - changing environment and quietly established herself as a modern style icon for young women			1
like @entity41 and @entity10 , @entity13 and @entity9 have been together for most of their adult lives			1
@entity10 and @entity41 met while they were both studying at the @entity44 and began their romance in late 2003			2
@entity13 and @entity9 at the @entity47 in @entity48 in 2006 @entity9 and @entity13 met in 2005 at the @entity49 when they were both just 17 years old - @entity9 was travelling with her father @entity50 , who was head of the @entity51 at the time			1
the couple were introduced at a party and hit it off , but according to reports , @entity13 chased the shy school student for several months before she agreed to go out with him			1
@entity9 kept such a low profile that the press were completely unaware of their relationship until @entity13 kissed her on camera during the @entity47 in @entity48 in 2006			1
after winning two matches against @entity64 and @entity65 at the tournament , @entity13 celebrated by jumping into the stands and embracing @entity9 - an exercise that he has completed several times since			1
@entity13 was @entity9 's first serious boyfriend			1
in fact , the @entity71 - born brunette had kept a low profile at @entity74 , with her nose mainly stuck in books			0
a fellow pupil said after they left : ' at school she was seen as a bit of a goody - goody who got on with her work and was very reserved			0
' she was very clever but she was quite shy and seemed very innocent			0
' tennis player @entity13 and his long time girlfriend @entity9 arrive at @entity85 in october 2013 , where @entity13 became an @entity87 like @entity10 , @entity9 was a keen sportswoman at school and did very well in her a-levels , getting straight a 's in drama , music and art before going on to study @entity93 at the @entity94 in @entity95			1
@entity10 graduated from @entity96 with almost identical grades , she obtained two a 's in maths and art , and a b in @entity100			1
in the early days of their relationship , @entity9 worked in a shop in @entity95 to support herself during her studies			2
her busy schedule meant that she and @entity13 lived largely independent lives , something that he has since credited with one of the reasons for their romance lasting			1
in an interview with the @entity112 , he said : ' she does n’t come to loads of tournaments as i also find being away from each other is good as well			0
' if you spend three months in a row together , by the end of it we ’re like , you know , arguing and stuff			0
' in a separate interview , he also claimed that she had better things to do that follow him around the globe			0
he said : ' she does n't want to follow me around on tour			0
' she wants to have her own career , not just pose in @entity135			2
' the @entity30 uttered similar sentiments about his now wife in an interview in 2010 about their brief break - up			2
he said : ' it was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up , and so it was just sort of a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better			0
' @entity9 has transformed her style since her boho chic fashion between 2006 ( right ) and 2008 ( left ) @entity9 is now known for her polished sense of style it is n't just both @entity13 and @entity9 's strong streaks of independence that has helped with the pressures of @entity13 's global career , her calm personality has also been credited for keeping the tennis star grounded ahead of important matches			1
his mother @entity161 claimed that she is one of the best things that had ever happened to her son and @entity13 has previously admitted that @entity9 is one of the few people that he even talks to during high - pressure tournaments			1
he said : ' i work better in a relationship			0
' at the end of a day , especially if i ’ve lost a match , i do n’t like talking about tennis , so it ’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff			0
' you 're in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it would be easy to get your head turned			0
' but @entity9 has always been there for me			2
' she really cares about me and helps with so many things			0
that 's why we have such a great relationship			0
' @entity9 is very close to @entity13 's family - his mother @entity161 ( left ) once claimed that she is one of the best things that had ever happened to her son @entity9 with @entity13 , his father @entity188 and one of the border terriers @entity191 although they are often apart for large periods of time , their home life is incredibly stable			1
after just a few years together , the couple moved into a £ 5 million house in @entity199 , @entity200 where they still live with their two border terriers , @entity203 and @entity191			0
@entity9 is so obsessed with dogs that she has built up a successful art business online , painting portraits of people 's pets			1
she regularly showcases her work on her website @entity211			0
@entity10 is also a huge fan of dogs - she likes them so much that her brother @entity213 gifted the couple with their cocker spaniel @entity217 for their wedding present			2
apart from art and dogs , her interests include long walks in the @entity100 countryside , @entity223 , country music and @entity226 novels			0
in fact , she is such a fan of the romantic books that her collection started to fall apart from over-reading			0
she once said : ' to label ( @entity230 ) as ‘ summer reading ’ does her a complete disservice			0
' i would have honestly written my dissertation on her if i was permitted			0
' i own two copies of ( her book ) @entity237 because on the third time of reading i had to hold the book together with a clothes peg as all the pages were dropping out			0
' like the @entity10 , a bouncy blow dry has become a hallmark of @entity9 's style @entity9 and @entity10 both have an enviable wardrobe for official events while the couple have had a largely stable relationship , like @entity41 and @entity10 , @entity13 and @entity9 split briefly a few years after their romance started			1
in november 2009 , the couple announced that they had broken up and @entity9 had moved out of their mansion and back into her family home			2
reports at the time blamed several issues , including @entity13 's addiction to video games			1
but the break did n't last long - seven months later they were back together			0
prince @entity41 and @entity10 split in march 2007 but got back together just a few months later at a party in june			2
since @entity9 and @entity13 's reconciliation , the pressure for the couple to get engaged has been relentless			1
much like with @entity10 , regular press reports questioned how long @entity9 would wait to get a ring on her finger , despite repeated affirmations from the couple that @entity9 was focusing on choosing her career path			1
so frustrated with the questioning , @entity13 sent a jokey tweet earlier this year in a q&a with fans on @entity278 , saying : ' we 're getting married just after @entity6 , should be a great day , ' but he was forced to retract the statement by his pr agency and admit it was said in jest			2
@entity13 and @entity9 arrive at the @entity284 collection in 2012 in 2013 , he cut down @entity285 during a television interview after the presenter asked when he would be asking for his girlfriend 's hand in marriage			1
she had said : ' i 'm trying to think what you 're next challenge will be			0
' you 've had the @entity49 , the @entity295 , now @entity6 , could it be popping the question ? ' he replied : ' i only met you like ten minutes ago so i would n't be telling you first			0
' now that the pair have finally announced official plans to tie the knot , the focus will surely turn to @entity9 's choice of wedding dress			2
since she first arrived on the scene as @entity13 's girlfriend , her hair and clothes have taken on an increasingly polished appearance , much like the @entity10			1
@entity9 and @entity13 sit front row at @entity310 2011 @entity313 / @entity312 collection in 2010 alongside @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 @entity9 's fashion choices are now a hot topic at every @entity6 and in 2013 , @entity320 even claimed that ' @entity9 reinvents the @entity321 at @entity6			1
' the pair are now regulars on the front row at @entity325			0
as well as planning for a wedding , @entity13 fans could also be looking forward to the arrival of a new tennis prodigy in the next few years , as @entity13 recently talked about his desire to start a family			2
he said last year : ' i can see myself having a family one day			0
' it is something that i 'm starting to think about			0

@entity9 and the @entity10 have followed similar paths
both women had long courtships before getting engaged to famous men
@entity343 claims independent @entity9 is ' best thing to happen to @entity13 '
straight a 's student shuns the limelight and has forged career as an artist
like @entity10 , @entity9 has had a style transformation into a fashion icon
