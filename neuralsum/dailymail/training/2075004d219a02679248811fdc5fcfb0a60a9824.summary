by @entity0 the new archbishop of @entity2 has indicated his support for a professional standards body to help clean up the banking industry			1
the @entity7 @entity6 made the remarks as he described the ' culture of entitlement ' affecting parts of the @entity12 and disconnecting it from ' what people saw as reasonable in the rest of the world '			1
the archbishop , a member of the cross-party @entity19 , also hinted that the government may need to recapitalise at least one major bank , and called for the creation of regional banks to help parts of the country outside of @entity27 flourish			1
scroll down for audio ' culture of entitlement ' : the archbishop of @entity2 hinted at his support for a professional banking body to enforce standards in the financial industry the spiritual leader of the world 's @entity37 said on @entity39 's @entity40 in @entity41 that ' serious consideration ' should be given to the creation of a professional banking body similar to the @entity45 to enforce standards			1
describing banks as ' incredibly complicated things ' , the archbishop told the @entity51 ' political editor @entity50 : ' the idea that people can hold hugely responsible positions in them without any kind of formal training seems to a number of us to be quite surprising			1
' asked whether he saw it as part of his mission to try to inject more morality into @entity65 financial life , the archbishop said : ' my key mission is to lead the church in worshipping @entity69 and encouraging people to believe in him and follow him			1
' ... issues of how the @entity12 , which is so important and so full of very gifted people , how that behaves in relation to the common good is very key , ' he added			2
bankers : the archbishop said it seemed ' surprising ' that people could hold hugely responsible positions in banks without any formal training the archbishop returned to the theme of the country 's financial woes in the radio interview following his warning on monday that @entity65 is in an economic depression and could take a generation to recover			1
he said then that it would take something ' very major ' to restore confidence and drag the country out of the mire			2
asked whether he minded ruffling a few feathers , he said : ' i do n't know if it annoyed people in @entity100			0
they have n't said anything here			0
i mean they probably would have preferred it not said			0
' historically depressions have been recognised as lengthy periods in which the economy did not get back to its previous level of activity before a recession set in			0
so 1929 to 1932 is the great example			0
' we are still significantly below where we were in 2007 in terms of economic activity , of gdp , and that 's quite a long time of being below			0
' now , i 'm not pointing any fingers at anyone in particular and saying it 's so and so 's fault or so and so 's fault , it 's simply a measurable fact coming from the national statistics			0
' the archbishop denied a suggestion that he meant that the bank to be recapitalised was the @entity128 , saying he would not name a bank			1
he added : ' i think the principle is that we need more regional banking			2
the appeal of regional banking is first that you have slightly smaller banks			1
i 'm not talking about mini banks			2
' again , the evidence we 've heard is that once you go over about a hundred billion pounds of balance sheet there are no economies of scale			0
if any there are diseconomies of being too big and the costs of that			0
and secondly , as a regional bank , inevitably you get a commitment to your local region to making it flourish			1
if you 're a long way away from somewhere you have less emotional commitment to that area			0
' the idea that has been suggested recently that that will result in sort of crony banking where , you know , regions just look after their own in a modern regulated environment , is completely absurd , ' the archbishop said .			2

archbishop said bankers should have to pass exams to raise standards
hinted the government may need to recapitalise at least one major bank
