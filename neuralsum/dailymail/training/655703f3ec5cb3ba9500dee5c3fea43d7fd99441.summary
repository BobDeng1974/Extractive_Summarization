by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 11:48 est , 29 january 2013 a businessman who spent £ 1million building a classic @entity2 with parts found around the world has spoken of his joy at seeing it take to the skies after 13 years			1
the iconic @entity9 fighter plane was meticulously pieced together after its fuselage was rescued by 51 - year - old @entity11 a decade ago			1
mr @entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , had been challenged to build his own spitfire by friends who gave him a single rivet from the aircraft			2
mr @entity11 gathered more genuine @entity20 parts from around the world - including four of the @entity36 engines which gave the @entity37 their unmistakable sound			1
he also found a £ 70,000 four - bladed propeller , wing skeletons , engine parts , wing cannons , flying instruments , original seats and components			1
one of its wings came from a @entity20 that crashed near @entity48 and lay for decades in a hedge near a pub until it was salvaged			2
last month , 13 years after the challenge the gleaming @entity20 took off from the soon - to - close @entity52 outside @entity22 for the first time since the 1940s			1
flying through @entity56 skies for the first time since the 1940s : the restored spitfire over @entity22 taking off : the gleaming aircraft attracted large crowds to @entity52 near @entity22 @entity11 in his workshop pictured with a @entity20 tail plane , for his next project determined : @entity11 was challenged to build his own spitfire by friends who gave him just one rivet of the aircraft for which he had to find the rest @entity70 has been synonymous with aviation development since before @entity72 when the @entity56 and @entity73 set up a flying ground there in 1911			1
the firm developed the iconic @entity77 and the airfield was used by the @entity79 during the war			2
between the wars , the firm became @entity83 and built aero engines , while @entity86 fighters were based at @entity70			1
during @entity9 , @entity83 expanded massively , producing the @entity88 and @entity89 , two medium - range twin - engine bombers			1
spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of @entity22			1
after the war , @entity22 continued to develop planes , by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners			1
@entity70 's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of @entity101 , in the 1960s and 1970s , by now under control of the @entity104			2
pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003			2
in 1977 @entity107 acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the @entity109 small airliner			2
mr @entity11 , who owns the @entity20 , said the expensive and painstaking restoration project with his 50 - strong team had been worth it			0
he said : ' many times i thought the project would n't ever be completed			0
but we never gave up the ghost			0
' @entity116 is something that makes @entity56 a great nation			0
i am humbled that 18 - year - old kids went up in them and died in them			0
' the occasion was a poignant one as @entity70 aerodrome was decommissioned by @entity107 after more than a century of aviation there			0
it closed on december 31			1
@entity107 , which said the site was no longer economically viable , is selling the airfield for housing and business development			0
crowds of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the @entity135 road which borders the airfield to watch the @entity20 take off , while @entity107 staff watched from beside the runway			0
they were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the @entity141 superjumbo , which was developed at @entity70 and is the world 's largest commercial aircraft			2
mr @entity11 said : ' to see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary , for it to happen at the same time as an @entity141 's final visit to @entity70 , has made this a sad but historic day			0
' i think it 's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close			0
' former @entity153 engineer @entity152 , who has worked as chief engineer on the @entity20 restoration for the last two - and - a - half years , said seeing the @entity20 and the @entity141 together on the runway that is also still overlooked by @entity101 was ' quite a sight ' for aviation enthusiasts			0
he said : ' it 's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at @entity70 has turned out to be a @entity37			0
' @entity52 , which has one of the longest and widest runways in the country , witnessed the first test flights of @entity101 and was where @entity167 soldiers injured in d - day were taken to before being treated at @entity22 's @entity170			1
the @entity172 's aviation industry grew up around the airfield , which developed an international reputation			0
devoted owner : @entity13 businessman @entity176 spent £ 1m restoring the @entity20 after it was found 10 years ago in a junkyard preparing for take - off : aeroplane enthusiasts lined the runway to watch the @entity9 fighter plane take to the skies painstaking work : the @entity20 has a fully rebuilt @entity36 engine race to finish : engineers worked long hours to finish the @entity20 's restoration in time for it to fly from @entity70 during the @entity191 , @entity190 bombers were stationed there , and the last @entity101 to fly , @entity101 216 , is parked there			1
there are plans for an aviation museum on the site , hosting both @entity101 and the @entity196 of @entity56 - designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century			0
the final flights from @entity70 will took off in december , before the aerodrome was decommissioned			0
end of an era : the @entity20 was originally built in around 1943 and is the last plane to be completed at the airfield attention to detail : here , @entity205 of @entity206 repaints the spitfire in its original colours stripped back : the @entity20 was the last plane to be built at @entity70 , the home of @entity56 - built @entity101 quite a paint job : @entity205 and @entity210 of @entity206 raced to finish repainting the classic plane spitfires fly over @entity213 , @entity214 , in 1939			1
