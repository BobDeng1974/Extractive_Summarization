blow : @entity1 , the @entity2 leader , whose claims @entity3 would not have to apply to join groups such as the @entity6 are sounding increasingly unlikely if @entity3 voted for independence it could have to re-apply to a whole host of international organisations including the @entity6 and the @entity13 , laywers said			1
it would also have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties , according to legal advice commissioned by @entity17			0
the report is a huge blow to @entity1 , the @entity2 leader , whose claims @entity3 would not have to apply to join groups such as the @entity6 are sounding increasingly unlikely			1
the legal advice concludes that @entity3 would become a ‘ new state ’ while the remaining @entity20 would be considered a ‘ continuing state ’			1
so if @entity3 seceded , only the rest of the @entity20 would continue to have the same rights , obligations and powers under international law			1
the @entity20 is a party to 14,000 treaties and is a member of groups such as the @entity32 , the @entity6 , @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35			1
the 57 - page report , written by professors @entity37 and @entity39 , raises the prospect that @entity3 will have to apply to re-join many of these if it votes for independence in a referendum next year			2
@entity43 said : ‘ those glorious @entity44 last summer reminded us just what we were capable of when we pull together : @entity3 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , all in the same boat – sometimes literally			2
if you told many people watching those @entity44 around the world that we were going to erect barriers between our people , they ’d probably be baffled			0
put simply : @entity20 works			0
why break it ? ’ addressing matters of the ' heart and head ' , mr @entity43 said @entity20 has built up ' world - renowned ' institutions such as the @entity60 and @entity61 , and ' fought for freedom in two world wars , leaving ' unbreakable bonds '			0
he said : ' i have no time for those who say there is no way @entity3 could go it alone			0
' i know first - hand the contribution @entity3 and @entity3 make to @entity20 's success - so for me there 's no question about whether @entity3 could be an independent nation			1
' the real question is whether it should - whether @entity3 is stronger , safer , richer and fairer within our @entity20 or outside it			1
' @entity3 ’s deputy first minister , @entity76 , said mr @entity43 had simply reminded people that ‘ he heads a government that @entity3 did n’t vote for and that independence is the only way to ensure that @entity3 always gets the government it votes for ’			0
a report from the first minister 's council of economic advisers suggested @entity3 should retain sterling as currency in the event of independence			2
holding on to the pound would also benefit the rest of the @entity20 as a key trading partner , the report concludes			2
professor @entity37 , of @entity95 , is an @entity97 state counsel , similar to a qc			0
professor @entity39 is an expert on international disputes			0
their opinion was requested last year by the @entity103 and @entity104 offices in @entity105 and the @entity106 in @entity107			0
agreement : if @entity3 gained independence , following a referendum agreed by @entity1 and @entity43 last year , @entity3 would have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties			1

@entity3 would have to re-apply to organisations including @entity6
remainder of @entity20 would continue to have same international powers
report is ' huge blow ' to @entity1
