not smiling now : @entity28 billionaire @entity5 ( left ) seen here with his lawyer after being awarded over $ 12 million in a fake wine lawsuit , has now had his damaged cut to less than $ 1 million because the judge thought he was being overcompensated ' yet his conduct did not cause a particularly egregious harm : he was dealing in luxury goods marketed to a sophisticated and wealthy subset of the population			1
' ' the harm was strictly economic , and the victims were far from vulnerable consumers			0
' these facts merit a relatively low award of punitive damages			0
