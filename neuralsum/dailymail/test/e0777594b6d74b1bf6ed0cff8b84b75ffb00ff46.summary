one penalty , a quiz answer - in - waiting and an extraordinary precedent that might just linger			2
that was the surreal upshot of one of the shortest international matches in history on thursday night , when 22 women from @entity8 and @entity10 ’s @entity9 19 sides got together for a couple of minutes of football			2
@entity14 stood up , a player for @entity16 but virtually anonymous in wider conversations about football			0
@entity14 ( centre ) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18 - second rematch against @entity10 @entity14 went the same way as her successful spot - kick last saturday and found the net once again @entity26 goalkeeper @entity25 was unable to stop @entity14 's brilliant effort the @entity8 captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2 - 2 draw the @entity8 players join the @entity16 star in celebration in front of a small crowd at the @entity37 @entity8 held on in the final moments to secure the draw and , with it , a place in this summer 's finals in @entity42 @entity14 blows a kiss to the crowd as @entity45 's side look ahead to this summer 's tournament number of seconds played : 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle number of @entity8 players on the pitch : @entity10 were already down to 10 outfield players , but @entity8 brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs @entity56 days between spot - kicks : five days between saturday 's clash and the controversial rematch number of goals scored : 1 - the infamous penalty she found out on wednesday that @entity8 would have to visit the @entity37 in @entity64 for a single penalty ; she spent thursday waiting as the frenzy grew and dragged her profile with it			1
but , at last , a footballer of @entity71 blood who can take a penalty			0
she rode the storm and tucked it away for 2 - 2 and a place in the @entity75 this summer			1
@entity14 said : ‘ they were the longest 24 hours of my life , i had n't slept			0
i went through so many emotions and just felt excitement			0
‘ we had a conversation just before i came out which was quite emotional			0
we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened			0
’ the broader context here was the decision that led to this tiny portion of a match being repeated five days after it was first played			0
@entity8 are awarded a penalty during their @entity94 qualifier on saturday referee @entity95 points to the spot as @entity8 are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute @entity14 steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against @entity10 in @entity64 the details are famous by now , as is the protagonist			1
@entity14 scored a 96th - minute penalty to make it 2 - 2 against @entity10 last saturday , but her @entity8 team - mate @entity105 had encroached the box			1
instead of ordering a retake , a rising @entity109 referee , @entity95 made a startling error and gave @entity10 a free - kick			1
the possibilities that will arise from @entity113 deciding to restage the game from the point of that mistake are fascinating			2
@entity117 , a sports lawyer at @entity118 , told @entity119 : ‘ many would see this as a dangerous precedent because @entity113 are intervening in an on - field refereeing mistake			1
‘ @entity113 need to make clear in any judgment what powers they have in extraordinary circumstances like this			0
there ’s effectively a @entity130 opening to clubs questioning even blatant refereeing mistakes in matches that may , for example , determine promotion or relegation			0
’ a @entity113 spokesman said : ‘ it has n’t happened so far and we have no reason to suspect leading referees would be capable of such basic errors			0
it is mostly a matter of experience			0
some of the referees at @entity148 level will be just starting out themselves			0
’ @entity14 probably experienced more than most			0
according to the laws of the game , a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team - mates of the player taking the kick			2
@entity14 runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate @entity105 ( circled ) has entered the box @entity14 turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner ahead of the 18 - second rematch , a @entity113 statement read : ' the @entity164 has ordered the match to be replayed			1
' the replay of the match should be carried out as follows : ' the match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the @entity170 at the @entity172 's under - 19 championship 2015 match between @entity8 vs @entity10 played on april 4 , 2015 , and extended according to the discretion of the referee			1
@entity109 referee @entity95 officiating a women 's @entity177 match in @entity179 last month @entity8 players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against @entity10 but referee @entity95 awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short @entity14 has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake but @entity14 then realises the referee 's decision and two @entity26 players are seen celebrating @entity109 referee @entity191 is understood to have been sent home following her error on saturday ' the penalty kick shall be retaken by the @entity170			1
' according to the @entity196 ( @entity197 14 ) , a team - mate of the player taking the kick infringes the @entity196 : - the referee allows the kick to be taken - if the ball enters the goal , the kick is retaken - if the ball does not enter the goal , the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred ' as the ball entered the goal , the kick should have been re-taken			1
thus the @entity217 ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 ( e ) and 7 ( 2 ) of the disciplinary regulations			2
@entity14 scored from the penalty spot during @entity8 's 3 - 1 victory against @entity56 on thursday @entity225 ( right ) scores with a header as @entity8 inched closer to @entity229 qualification ' @entity230 must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment			1
any of these players can take the penalty kick			0
' an @entity170 spokesperson said : ' after @entity8 women @entity238 ' match against @entity10 on saturday , april 4 , the @entity170 lodged an appeal to @entity113 following a disallowed penalty			1
' due to an incorrect application of the game 's laws by the match referee , @entity113 have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty			1
' the remainder of the match will be played on thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – @entity37 , @entity64			0
' @entity14 is congratulated by her @entity8 team - mates after scoring past @entity254 goalkeeper @entity253 former @entity255 and @entity8 captain @entity45 is head coach of the national women 's @entity257 team although it only lasted around 50 seconds , officials , stewards and paramedics were all required to attend and admission was free for fans			1
@entity8 , coached by former national captain @entity45 , were 2 - 0 down to @entity10 on saturday before substitute @entity105 pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point			1
however , @entity268 's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat			2
@entity8 brushed off the disappointment on monday , though , with a 9 - 1 win against @entity273			1
both @entity8 and @entity10 had to start the match with the same players who finished saturday 's match and both teams had completed what should have been the final round of @entity281 matches just hours earlier on thursday			1
@entity45 's side defeated @entity56 3 - 1 as @entity225 scored twice at the @entity37 either side of another @entity14 spot - kick as she scored past @entity254 goalkeeper @entity253 from 12 - yards			1
the controversial decision further complicated the already complex qualification process for july 's finals after @entity113 had announced that @entity10 had sealed their place regardless of the result in @entity64			1
after an initial qualifying round last year , the @entity292 is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across @entity297			0
the six group winners and best - placed runner - up ( @entity10 ) - decided by the best record against the first and third - placed teams in the groups - went through to join hosts @entity42 at the showpiece event in july			2
@entity8 women 's senior head coach @entity305 tweeted : ' difficult circumstances for our @ england @entity257			2
i have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride			0
' regardless of final outcome you should be very proud			0
we are very proud of you			0
' september 2005 - @entity317 qualifier - @entity315 vs @entity318 @entity315 had won the opening leg of the @entity321 zone fourth - round play - off 1 - 0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching			2
rather than retaking the penalty , an indirect free - kick was wrongly awarded by @entity329 referee @entity328 to @entity318 and the game ended with a one - goal margin			1
@entity315 called for an investigation but were left furious after @entity333 ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid			0
it proved to have a major impact as it was @entity318 who eventually went through with a 1 - 1 away goals victory , though they were later beaten in the @entity344 - @entity343 play - off			2
@entity318 staff and players celebrate after beating @entity315 in an @entity321 @entity317 qualifier in 2005			0
