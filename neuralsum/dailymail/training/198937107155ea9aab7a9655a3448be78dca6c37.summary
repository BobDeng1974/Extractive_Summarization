@entity0 might want to spend a little time with their noses buried in @entity4 's book of on - field wrestling holds			2
they had @entity6 by the throat on tuesday night thanks to goals from @entity9 and @entity10 , but somehow relaxed their grip and turned what seemed like a procession into a nail - biter			1
@entity4 would never make an elementary mistake like that as @entity17 can testify			0
@entity6 replied through @entity18 , with his first goal since signing last month , and produced the aggression and spirit which will make their manager proud , and offer some hope for the relegation scrap ahead			1
@entity10 celebrates his first and @entity0 's second goal at the @entity26 against @entity6 on tuesday night @entity6 's @entity27 ( left ) and @entity0 's @entity28 get into a tangle in what turned into a spirited encounter @entity6 's @entity32 struck back as @entity6 continued to fight for their manager until the final whistle @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity34 6.5 ; @entity35 6.5 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity9 7 , @entity37 6.5 ; @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 ; @entity10 7 ( @entity40 73 ) , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 7.5 ; @entity43 6.5 ( @entity28 68 )			1

booked : @entity27 scorer : @entity18 manager : @entity4 - 7 referee : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) - 6.5 @entity74 - @entity42 see our @entity75 for the calamitous lead - up to @entity6 's goal and more great stats they pushed for the equaliser , @entity18 missed a wonderful late chance and they probably deserved to take a point , but they left with none and remain rock bottom of the @entity88			1
@entity0 moved almost apologetically into the top four , for at a day at least , responding to defeat in the @entity89 as @entity90 dropped points at @entity92 , but this made for uneasy viewing at times for @entity52			0
it was a seventh win in eight games since @entity98 but not the first time this season his team has panicked at the first sign of trouble			0
they surrendered the lead at @entity90 , not to mention @entity105 and @entity92			0
in fact , it has happened a little too often for a side with pretentions of challenging for major honours ; a character flaw which remains despite the impressive win at @entity113 last month			0
there were added concerns with injuries to @entity43 , who returned after a hamstring injury but hurt his knee and was under - par until replaced , and @entity40 lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign			1
@entity6 owner @entity121 shakes hands with embattled manager @entity4 ahead of the match at the @entity26 @entity4 ( centre left ) watches the first half from the stands after escaping an @entity128 charge over a clash with @entity130 's @entity17 @entity0 's @entity38 times a sliding challenge on @entity6 's @entity17 during the lively opening minutes @entity56 tackles dangerous @entity133 forward @entity43 at the @entity26 in north @entity135 on tuesday night @entity43 can only toe the ball away as he 's held by @entity138 ' defender @entity137 ' i can not say it is not a worry , ' said @entity52 ; a double negative within the overall positive of clinging onto the lead			1
' it is not good news			0
' @entity43 later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a ' knock ' as the manager claimed			2
on a night when @entity152 and @entity153 won , there was some encouragement for @entity4 and his chairman @entity121 , who is thought to have sacked the manager on sunday before a change of heart			0
the manager said he had lunch with the owners but did n't offer to pay and sat just behind the @entity162 owner in the first - half before moving down to the touchline for the second - half revival			2
@entity4 said he had spoken to @entity17 on the eve of the game and apologised after a text message from the @entity130 midfielder and received a warm post-match handshake and words of support from @entity52			0
@entity60 threatens the @entity0 goal in a promising start for @entity6 but ca n't give the relegation threatened side a lead @entity43 gets in front of @entity6 defender @entity58 ( right ) despite the distinct height difference and heads towards goal @entity0 's @entity10 shoots but ca n't beat @entity6 's recently signed veteran keeper @entity53 this time @entity9 ( third from right ) strikes first time from a corner to open the scoring for the @entity133 @entity9 's strike makes its way toward the bottom corner of @entity6 's goal @entity6 's @entity192 keeper @entity53 fails to get his left boot to the ball as @entity0 take the lead @entity9 falls on his front - and @entity53 on his back - after finding the back of the net to make the score 1 - 0 after 27 minutes @entity9 find his feet to begin his celebrations after the opener for @entity52 's side as @entity10 raises his arms in triumph ' i am surprised they are bottom of league and they want to get rid of their manager , ' said the @entity0 boss			1
' if they keep quiet , do n't panic and stick together , they will get out of that			0
they are one of better teams we 've played			0
' @entity6 's performance will have offered great satisfaction - certainly more appealing than the @entity223 folk band he endured on sunday as speculation raged about his future at the club			1
playing well and losing is not a good habit to be in but the players are working hard for him , none more than @entity60 , who was outstanding on the right wing and gave the @entity0 problems all game with his energy and direct style			0
@entity60 opened with a dangerous low cross , almost deflected into his own net by @entity9 , and an effort which clipped @entity240 on the knee and flashed wide			2
@entity55 's flying tackle collects @entity43 as the @entity244 marksman gets airborne @entity43 soars spectacularly into the air after the challenge from @entity55 the ball escapes both players as @entity43 is upended while attacking the @entity6 goal the cryptic tweet from @entity43 after the match that suggests his injury before substitution may be more than a ' knock ' @entity10 takes in his acclaim from the @entity26 faithful as he gives the @entity133 a 2 - 0 lead @entity42 's long - range strike was too hot for @entity53 to handle leading to @entity10 's goal the former @entity262 and most recently @entity261 custodian @entity53 parries the shot from the @entity265 attacker @entity10 beats the @entity138 defence to the loose ball to drill it into the back of the net beyond the keeper @entity53 dives in vain as @entity10 picks his spot to perfection @entity10 shows his appreciation to the @entity133 crowd that he has seen less than he 'd hope this season due to injury @entity42 ( right ) gets appropriate credit for the lead - up to the second goal from scorer @entity10 ( left ) and @entity35 @entity4 had tweaked his usual system to deploy wing - backs and three central defenders , including debuts for @entity54 , signed on transfer deadline day , and @entity55 , signed last summer but absent until now with ankle problems			1
unfortunately for @entity55 , he did not last the game and came soon after the break , although the manager claimed it was ' precautionary '			0
@entity52 's team , however , were soon in control			2
@entity53 stood up to block with his chest from @entity10 and @entity42 danced through a crowded penalty box before forcing another save			1
@entity53 tipped @entity42 's effort wide and from the corner , taken by the @entity265 , @entity0 went ahead			1
@entity9 caught @entity56 napping and met the low , in - swinging set - piece on the half - volley , sweeping it inside the post from six yards			2
before the break , @entity53 was unable to hold a fierce drive by @entity42 and parried the ball towards @entity10 on the right , who adjusted superbly well to the rebound , arriving at pace to thump a first - time drive into the far corner			1
@entity18 hits the loose ball beyond @entity240 as @entity6 's fight back continued @entity34 is beaten at his near post as @entity0 fail to put the game to bed and are forced into a nail - biter @entity38 was @entity52 's everywhere man in the midfield - click here for more heat maps in @entity320 's @entity75 @entity42 's influence since his return from injury has been impressive			1
although not always in the thick of the action , he has made telling contributions in front of goal and his creative juices were flowing again			0
@entity0 looked capable of matching the five they put past @entity330 in their previous home game but were forced back and wobbled under this pressure			2
@entity18 pulled one back as the home side claimed @entity59 had handled as the ball was trapped under his body in a scramble following a corner they failed to clear , but no free - kick was given and the goal was fired through a crowd by the £ 9million @entity342 , signed in january			1
anxiety washed around the stadium and @entity52 sent on substitutes and @entity4 sent on the strikers he had left on the bench			2
@entity60 went close again and @entity18 was clean through and attempted to chip @entity240			2
it was an ambitious move – a bad decision - and he did not clear the goalkeeper			0
@entity4 and his staff threw up their arms in collective dismay			0
it would be their last chance of the night			0
@entity4 shows some trademark emotion after making his way to the sideline for the second half @entity55 , who signed last summer but has had ankle problems , limps off the pitch soon after the interval @entity43 's departure after 68 minutes wo n't bring @entity133 fans a whole lot of joy given the @entity244 's prolific form this season			1

@entity9 volleyed home from a @entity42 's corner for the opener in the 27th minute
@entity10 was on the spot to drive open @entity53 's parry after a blistering @entity42 shot
@entity18 pegged one back for bottom - placed @entity6 just after the hour mark
@entity43 hurt his knee and @entity40 lasted nine minutes after coming off the bench
