greatness has been found : the victory @entity2 shirts proudly worn by the @entity4 women 's soccer team after their gold medal win against @entity6 last night has caused a worldwide backlash @entity27 , a soccer writer for @entity29 's @entity28 , wrote : ' @entity31 players have donned t - shirts reading " greatness has been found			1
" that , in a nutshell , is why no one outside the @entity4 likes them			0
' but for a beloved team , widely viewed as @entity4 's own wonder women , the criticisms may be seen as a case of sour grapes towards a country currently charging ahead in medal counts			0
@entity29 's loss to the @entity4 women 's soccer team on monday caused its own fair share of controversy , after the referee made several calls toward the end of the second half that left the @entity29 not just heartbroken , but angry , according to the @entity52			2
forward @entity53 said : ' i could n’t believe what happened			0
and it was just taken away			0
' @entity62 , who scored all three of @entity29 's goals , added : ' we feel like we did n’t lose , we feel like it was taken from us			0
' @entity66 commenters have weighed in on the debate , with @entity68 from @entity69 , @entity70 , writing : ' for gods sake , @entity29 just seem like sore losers to me			0
' why can @entity74 act like the most arrogant , cocky , full of himself and rude man on earth , but a bunch of talented football players ca n't wear some t - shirts ? foolishness , probably because they 're women			1
besides , i 'm @entity83 , and i like them			0
' loud and proud : after winning 2 - 1 , the @entity4 team returned to the field wielding the @entity4 flag , big smiles and t - shirts with slogans that read ' greatness has been found , ' critics , viewers and fans to cringe celebration : the @entity97 display of victory shirts with such a definitive slogan has been labelled by commentators as tacky with a blatant disregard for sportsmanship however @entity4 's own @entity103 , a sports writer for the @entity104 , also appeared offended by the teams ' @entity2 victory shirts			1
he tweeted : ' " greatness has been found , " but not humility			1
' members of the team were handed the shirts immediately after their win , a common ritual for big victories in @entity4 team sports			2
was the @entity4 women 's soccer team justified in wearing victory t - shirts ? after the @entity122 and @entity123 basketball title games , for example , the winning teams will sport victory gear usually branded with the generic ' champions '			1
however the @entity97 display of victory shirts with such a definitive slogan has been labelled by commentators as tacky with a blatant disregard for sportsmanship			1
@entity131 's @entity130 tweeted : ' put those t - shirts away , @entity31			2
' while no - one has blamed the women on the team for wearing shirts they were handed , many are angry at the ' go - betweens ' for @entity2 and the @entity4 team			1
the @entity141 wrote : ' they should have realized the way those shirts could have been perceived			2
raised eyebrows : @entity27 , a soccer writer for @entity29 's @entity28 shared his thoughts on @entity22 critics criticize : @entity104 writer @entity103 was one of many to pan the ' humility - lacking ' @entity2 shirts on @entity22 ' wearing a personalized shirt at an @entity97 that seems to rub the loss in face of defeated opponents plays into the stereotype of ugly @entity154			1
for the fans : @entity2 is selling the victory t - shirts on its website for $ 30 ' if people who were rooting for the women ’s soccer team found them off - putting , imagine the reaction of the rest of world			1
' the gold - winning team 's victory shirts is n't the only celebratory symbol that has raised eyebrows during this year 's @entity97 , however			2
during a game against @entity170 , the @entity4 women 's soccer team capped its victories with cartwheels , front flips and a team rendition of the " worm " - sometimes even during the middle of the game			2
@entity170 coach @entity181 , after her team 's 2 - 0 loss , said : ' i would n't like it if our team did that			2
we try to work on scoring goals			0
we have n't got time to work on celebrations			0
' tennis star @entity190 celebrated her @entity97 gold with a ' @entity192 ' - a dance that originated with the @entity195 street gang and later spread around the world			0
while her sister @entity200 , sitting in the stands , looked delighted , @entity197 , the very proper home of the @entity70 @entity199 , had never seen anything like it , and a few commentators were not amused			0
' it was just me , ' the @entity4 medalist said later			0
' i love to dance			0
