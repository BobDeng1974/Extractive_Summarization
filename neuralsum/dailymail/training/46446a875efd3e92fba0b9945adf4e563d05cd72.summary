@entity0 has spelled out to @entity1 the expectation on @entity3 to make it to @entity5 ahead of their crucial first qualifier in @entity8 on monday			1
@entity3 lag 11 places behind their @entity11 opponents in @entity13 ’s world rankings but @entity0 insists @entity1 ’s team are favourites because of the depth of quality at his disposal compared to @entity8			1
the @entity19 defender , who has played every minute for the @entity21 ’s joint - meanest defence so far this season , believes @entity24 players sometimes wear the @entity3 shirt heavily , including at the @entity26 in @entity27 where he says : ‘ everyone expected more			1
’ @entity30 warning : @entity0 believes the pressure is on @entity3 to qualify for @entity5 disappointment : @entity3 crashed out of the @entity32 during the group stages but ahead of their clash at @entity37 ’s @entity36 , @entity0 believes the onus to deliver remains on the visitors			1
‘ i do n’t think you can ever enter as favourites against a big team like @entity3 , ’ he explains			1
‘ we are still a small country , we are developing very well and qualifying for big tournaments			2
but @entity3 are a massive country in football and they have a lot of players to pick from			1
‘ it ’s different in @entity8 , because @entity3 are expected to win and go to every tournament			1
with the players and quality they have they should do that			2
‘ for @entity8 it ’s a massive achievement to qualify for any competition			1
now we ’ve raised the bar really high , qualifying for the last three @entity58 , every time we do n’t qualify it will be a big disappointment			2
‘ we want our level of football to compete with the big nations			2
’ under @entity63 , @entity8 thrived to such an extent that they entered the summer ’s @entity26 as a seeded nation following an unbeaten qualifying campaign			1
in @entity27 they won a thriller against @entity70 , experienced a chastening defeat to @entity72 but then rallied to beat @entity73			2
in the last 16 they only went out to @entity75 by virtue of @entity78 ’s late goal in extra time			2
under pressure : @entity3 boss @entity1 must guide the @entity3 to @entity5 @entity3 were eliminated before 12 teams had even played their second game after defeats to @entity84 and @entity85 , before limping to a 0 - 0 draw with @entity87			1
@entity0 declines to say what he thinks went wrong but concedes most seasoned observers had higher hopes			1
‘ it ’s a big competition and it ’s always difficult to go through , ’ he adds			2
‘ i know we have a very tough game against them and that ’s all i want to concentrate on			0
‘ we are going to try to battle hard and start this new campaign on a good foot			0
a win means you can do something special			0
’ @entity102 coach @entity101 , 51 , has taken over from @entity63 , who retired aged 65 , and despite losing the man who masterminded @entity8 ’s recent success , @entity0 describes the atmosphere in the camp as ‘ very excited ’			1
new reign : @entity102 coach @entity101 has replaced the recently retired @entity63 ‘ he ’s going to create something new , the whole country is up for it			0
’ it is nearly a decade since the 29 - year - old made his international debut and he hopes to win his 55th cap against @entity3			1
he is well placed to identify how a country of eight million has managed to compete at the last five major tournaments			0
he attributes their standing to an emphasis on youth development and the embracing of migrant families			0
@entity0 , son of a @entity123 father and @entity125 mother , won the @entity126 in 2002			1
‘ the national team and every single club in @entity8 has done major work on youth			1
the next generation to mine ( in 2009 ) were world champions in @entity133 , a massive achievement			0
those players now have come through to the first team			0
‘ also in @entity8 we have a lot of immigrants , born and raised here but with heritage from different countries , and have used that to our advantage			1
if you see our line - up we do n’t have many @entity147 names in the team			0
it ’s very important for a small country to do that			0
’ @entity19 might have two representatives on the pitch in @entity37 , if @entity154 earns selection from @entity1			0
‘ he will bring his energy , his power , his will to move forward all the time , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ he is a very positive player to have around			0
’ there are kind words too for maligned @entity161 , and an explanation of why he is a nightmare for centre - backs			0
‘ it ’s very difficult to mark him because he ’s always moving around and finding these pockets between the midfield and the striker ‘ for us as defenders he brings you out of the spot where you are normally comfortable			0
he will thrive as @entity3 captain			2
’ happy : former @entity174 defender @entity0 is delighted to be back in the @entity21 @entity0 is thriving alongside @entity175 for @entity19 , and the pair have only conceded once in three @entity21 games as @entity179 ’s side sit among the @entity181 places			1
it is a brighter start than how his three - year spell at @entity184 ended , before a six - month stint in @entity186 with @entity187			0
‘ i ’m very pleased to be back in the @entity21 , ’ he says			1
‘ we have started well but it ’s very early and we have to continue working			0
‘ i ’m sad about what happened at @entity184 and wish them all the best			0
i went to a big club like @entity187 , so i was very pleased with my move			2
‘ it was a good experience			0
we played in the semi-finals of the @entity196 and were so close to going to the final			0
’ for @entity3 going close will not do			2
@entity1 must qualify.irmly in the thoughts of @entity199 .			0
