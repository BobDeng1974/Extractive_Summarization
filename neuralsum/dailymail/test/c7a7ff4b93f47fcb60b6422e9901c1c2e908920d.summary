the adoptive grandparents of a @entity2 toddler who died after a brutal beating last month are speaking out against the boy 's mother , who they say did n't do enough to protect her son from her boyfriend			1
@entity8 , 22 , was arrested wednesday on capital murder charges in connection to the march 19 death of 2 - year - old @entity12 , the son of his girlfriend @entity13			1
@entity15 and @entity16 considered themselves @entity12 's grandparents , even though they were n't blood related to the little boy			1
@entity16 's son - @entity15 's stepson - started dating @entity13 when she was six - months pregnant with @entity12 and they continued to babysit the toddler when the two eventually broke up			1
in a heartbreaking interview with the @entity26 , the couple said they started noticing bruises on @entity12 last fall , when @entity13 started dating @entity8 , and say the mother ignored them when they voiced concern			1
eventually , they reported @entity12 's injuries to @entity35 , but the agency closed the investigation in february , ruling out abuse from @entity12 's parents or @entity8			1
a little over a month later , @entity12 was dead			2
while they are happy to see @entity8 's arrest , both want @entity35 and @entity13 held accountable for the role they played in @entity12 's death			1
' they left the child vulnerable			0
they made that decision and they made the wrong decision , ' @entity15 told the @entity26			0
@entity15 and @entity16 first met @entity13 in late 2012 , when she started dating @entity16 's son			1
at the time , she was carrying @entity12 , her son with former boyfriend @entity61			2
when @entity13 gave birth three months later , @entity15 and @entity16 considered @entity12 their grandson and started babysitting when his mother went back to work			1
at one point , @entity13 broke up with @entity16 's son and briefly got back together with @entity12 's father			1
all the while , the couple continued their relationship with @entity13 in order to be a part of @entity12 's life			1
but last fall , both became seriously concerned when they noticed bruises and other injuries on the little boy 's body after @entity13 started dating @entity8			1
@entity12 ( right ) died in the hospital on march 19 , the day after his second birthday , from head trauma			1
@entity8 ( left ) has been accused of causing those injuries ' i start noticing a change in @entity12 's behavior , ' @entity15 said			1
' he 's starting to hit me in the face			0
sometimes when she brings him over , he 's like in shock			0
… he clings to me			0
i 'm telling her [ @entity13 ] , " i do n't know what the deal is but there 's something going on here			2
" ' when they told @entity13 about the marks , she dismissed them saying he got them roughhousing with some other children at @entity8 's mother house			1
after highlighting the injuries with @entity61 , the boy 's biological father , and a lawyer , the two decided to go against @entity13 ' wishes and make a report to @entity35 on december 23			1
three days later , they became even more concerned when @entity8 came over to their house to pick up @entity12 , and the boy appeared scared to leave			2
' he immediately ran to me , grabbed me … and was holding on , ' @entity15 said			0
' he would look over and look away from him , and he started crying			0
he dug into my arm with his little fingernails so much it broke the skin			0
' and then @entity8 became angry when @entity15 told him he would drop the boy off himself when @entity13 got home			2
@entity15 says @entity8 went straight to @entity13 ' work , and she started sending @entity15 a slew of text messages , chastising him for not handing @entity12 over to her boyfriend			1
@entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) , who consider themselves adoptive grandparents of @entity12 , say they started noticing bruises on the boy in november , when @entity13 started dating @entity8 ' @entity15 you ca n't make decisions like that			1
i am his mother , ' @entity13 texted @entity15 , in messages he shared with the @entity26			2
' and if you keep this up i 'm gon na have to make other arrangement for @entity12			0
' @entity15 went on to say that he loved @entity12 and was just trying to do what 's best for the boy			2
' @entity15 i do n't appreciate you insinuating that @entity136 is harmful to me and my child , @entity136 loves @entity12 and is really good with him , ' @entity13 continued ' @entity12 is frightened of him , that is a fact … i am concerned you do not realize it , ' @entity15 replied			2
' that 's your opinion			0
please mind your own business , ' @entity13 said			0
shortly after that , @entity13 banned @entity15 from spending time with @entity12			2
@entity15 says @entity35 never called to interview him after he reported the potential abuse at the end of december , and says he had to follow up in order to speak to an officer about his concerns			0
in a meeting on february 9 , a @entity35 worker assured @entity15 that the family was under investigation			0
but shortly after , the case was closed and @entity12 's parents and @entity8 were cleared of any wrongdoing			1

in separate interviews with police , both @entity12 's mother and @entity8 said that the boy started acting strange the day before , after @entity8 put the boy in a time out for not eating his lunch			1

that night , @entity13 says her son vomited and had a hard time standing on his own			0
and when she tried to feed him a slice of banana the next morning , he could n't keep food down			0

@entity8 's version of events differs slightly from @entity12 ' , in that he claimed the boy could stand up and was acting normally after finding him on the ground next tot he playpen			1
he does admit that the boy later vomited and appeared ' sleepy ' but says the next morning @entity12 was awake , talking and ' having fun '			0
while @entity15 and @entity16 are happy with @entity8 's arrest , the two say they want to see @entity35 and @entity12 held accountable for the role they plated in @entity12 's death internet searches reveal that @entity8 was more concerned that night than what he descirbed to police			1
