‘ when things are tough , it feels like the whole world is against you and you ca n’t see a way out			0
but when you ’re standing on top of the podium you are n’t thinking about the struggles , you ’re just thinking how amazing that moment is			0
the hard times do n’t last forever			2
’ fulfilling her potential : @entity31 sprinter @entity1 feels she is finally starting to display her promise frustrating : @entity1 had difficult 2012 and 2013 seasons as she struggled to step - up to senior level @entity1 had the tattoo done a year ago after an underwhelming 2013 season			1
it had been scarcely better than 2012 when her dream of competing at a home olympics ended at the trials in @entity41			1
she finished in a crumpled heap halfway down the track , sobbing with the pain of a pulled hamstring			2
@entity1 said : ‘ physically your body heals quite quickly and it was n’t such a serious injury that i had to take a lot of time out but i had a few small injuries one after another and it almost feels like everyone ’s against you and you ’re never going to come back			1
i was fit during 2013 but i was still struggling massively with my confidence			2
‘ i ’ve always been quite against sport psychologists because i ’m not very good at discussing things			0
it was just about getting races under my belt so it took me a long time but each time i was chipping away at it and slowly exorcising those demons			2
’ reminder : @entity1 has ' pain is temporary ' and ' victory is forever ' tattooed on her wrists @entity1 burst onto the international sprinting scene at 15 when she won the 100m and 200m titles at the @entity72			1

it is easy to forget she is still only 20			2
‘ it would be great if people could bear that in mind , ’ she says			0

success : @entity1 ran the fourth - fastest time by a @entity31 female in the 200m in @entity102 last week ‘ it ’s only after having those years out that i ’ve looked back and thought “ wow , there was a big thing about me around at that time , a big buzz , and that was an awful lot of pressure to be dealing with at a young age ”			1
‘ some people wrote me off very quickly but it takes a little while to translate to the seniors			0
i ’ve still hopefully got a good five years until i reach my peak			0
’ @entity1 ’s victory in the national trials in @entity41 this month prompted her to say : ‘ i finally feel i ’m mentally back to the athlete i was			1
i wanted to be @entity118 champion			2
