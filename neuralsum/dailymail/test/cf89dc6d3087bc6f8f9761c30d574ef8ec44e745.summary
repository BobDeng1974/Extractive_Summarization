' we are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients			1

other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients			1

and menstruating women may benefit from adding oils ( @entity56 ) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate @entity60 symptoms ( ms @entity61 recommends magnesium citrate )			1
always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day ' fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients , which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer , @entity75 's and heart disease , ' ms @entity61 said			1

' the nutritionist is also a keen advocate of incorporating as much healthy fat as possibly into your diet			1
' we have all been encouraged to follow a low fat diet , but we need to start embracing fats , ' she said			0
' oily fish , nuts and seeds contain vital nutrients so ignore the calorie counts and give your body the healthy food it craves and needs			1
' healthy fat does n’t make you fat ; a diet rich in processed carbohydrates and sugar makes you fat			1
' a high carbohydrate , sugar rich diet keeps you hungry but also stops you absorbing vital nutrients , causes depression , fatigue and energy dips			1
instead of taking supplements , eat 100g of dark chocolate ( left ) or six oysters ( right ) for zinc ' eat real food and your body with thank you for it			1
