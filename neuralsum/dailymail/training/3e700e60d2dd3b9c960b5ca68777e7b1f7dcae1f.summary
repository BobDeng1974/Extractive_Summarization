within moments of @entity4 's latest photos appearing online , the tills at @entity1 were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16 - month - old 's £ 32 tank top			1
but as demand skyrocketed , the sailboat - emblazoned top soon sold out - leaving a crowd of frustrated mothers in its wake and gleeful fashion brand executives rushing through a fresh batch			1
now , the knitted tank tops have begun to appear on @entity17 but will cost would - be purchasers far more than they did in the shops			1
another has attracted bids amounting to £ 55 , while another , a larger version aimed at boys aged three to four , is currently listed at £ 35			1
this is not the first time the @entity4 effect has struck at a brand 's bottom line			2
although just 16 - months - old , nearly everything the toddler wears sells out			2
indeed , within 48 hours of being carried from the @entity42 in a receiving blanket by @entity44 + @entity45 , the £ 44.95 wrap had sold out , while traffic to the brand 's website shot up by 1,960 per cent			2
and so it has continued , with @entity53 brand @entity51 benefiting when @entity4 wore its £ 27.50 striped sailcloth dungarees for his first birthday photo , and children 's designer @entity57 enjoying a cash boost from his appearances during the @entity61			1
@entity62 , who was almost unheard of until @entity4 wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a ' crawl - about ' in @entity66 , credits the @entity4 effect with transforming her business			1
gorgeous : the new photos of @entity4 were released ahead of the @entity71 holiday lucrative : the £ 32 @entity1 top has now sold out but is to be reissued by the label ' he is such a high profile baby and he ’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand , ' the @entity75 - based designer said in an interview with @entity82			1
' it ’s been phenomenal for the business to have @entity4 wearing pieces from the collection			2
personally , as a @entity91 citizen , if there ’s one child i ’d want to dress it ’s the heir to the throne			0
' others to benefit include little known @entity96 label , @entity97 whose white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as @entity4 arrived in @entity100 , and @entity103 's @entity102 whose website crashed after the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day out at the polo			1
' @entity4 wore the sailboat romper by @entity108 on two occasions , at the @entity111 arrival in @entity66 ( with a white cardigan ) and in @entity100 , ' remembers @entity97 founder , @entity113			2
cute : @entity4 sparked a sales boom at @entity57 after being photographed in this sailboat romper suit first hit : the @entity116 came into being 48 hours after he was born when his white blanket sold out ' it was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by @entity4			1
we had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper			0
' and it is n't just @entity97 sales figures that have felt the @entity4 effect			2
as ms @entity113 explains , the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself. , ' we had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop , ' she explains			0
' with all the publicity we received , we had to speed up setting the shop up			0
' it also motivates us for our future projects			0
now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing			0
' a fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn / winter collection ; this has been very encouraging for us			0
' most of all though , ms @entity113 says she is thrilled by the simple fact that the @entity148 liked her work enough to buy it for her baby son			0
popular : so popular did this pair of @entity153 dungarees prove , they sold out in blue and red good look : @entity4 's wardrobe for @entity100 and @entity66 proved more popular than his mother 's ' we are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration for the royals , ' she beams			1
' the fact that they liked our sailboat romper means a lot to us , regardless of whether the current sailboat romper frenzy continue or not			0
' we will always remember the moment we saw the little prince wearing our romper , and the excitement we felt			0
we feel great about the fact that @entity108 can dress little boys all over the world like little princes			0
' and dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog , what @entity4 wore , dedicated to all things baby style			1
the blog even has a sister site in the shape of @entity184 wore - a website devoted to the @entity148 's wardrobe - although prince @entity187 is yet to find similar favour with the fashion set			0
but while the @entity148 might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears , even she can not compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power			0
from £ 44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops , the @entity4 effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and @entity17 entrepreneurs contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come .			1
