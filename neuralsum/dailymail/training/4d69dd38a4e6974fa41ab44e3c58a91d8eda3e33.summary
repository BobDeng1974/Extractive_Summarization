a baby whose heart stopped fro 26 minutes has survived and is now home from hospital after just a month			1
midwives at @entity5 had almost given up on little @entity6 when she was born on september 21 and they realised her heart was not beating			1
her mother @entity8 , 20 , had experienced a normal pregnancy and @entity6 was born after 39 weeks - but it was only during labour that problems began when she was not moving or crying			1
@entity8 , 20 , kisses her daughter @entity6 for the first time after her heart stopped beating for 26 minutes she was immediately given cpr and her heart finally started again after 26 minutes			1
ms @entity8 , from @entity16 in @entity17 , said : ' they pulled the emergency cord and suddenly about 20 or 30 people were in the ward			2
' i was watching them give her cpr and it was terrifying			0
it went on for 20 minutes , at which point they usually stop , but they kept going and luckily her heartbeat came back			2
' she continued : ' i saw her a few hours after the birth and it was heart - breaking because she was sedated and still really struggling to breathe			0
@entity6 , pictured in the incubator at @entity5 , was born at 39 weeks but was n't moving or crying ' she looked blue and her organs were starting to die from the lack of oxygen			1
' the doctors thought she was n't going to survive and that whole week was the hardest of my life			0
every day we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst			0
' following the birth , @entity6 spent a week on a ventilator in the neo-natal intensive care unit			2
doctors were still unsure whether she would make it , but she kept breathing once the ventilator was removed			0
ms @entity8 added : ' i had decided that if she could n't breathe without the machine i would let her go - it was causing her so much pain to have it down her throat			2
' @entity6 has suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen to the brain , but the extent of it is not yet known			1
it is also likely she will have cerebral palsy			1
after just a month in @entity62 has been allowed home with her mother but she has suffered brain damage @entity8 , pictured with almost five - week old baby @entity6 , says she feels like the ' luckiest mum in the world ' the single mother says she feels like the luckiest in the world and added : ' i think she can still have a very good life			1
' we 'll try and do as much as we can for her by taking her to all sorts of different classes and not just sit her in front of the telly			0
' when she 's awake she 's very alert and reacts when i talk to her			0
' she 's here and that 's the main thing			0
' doctors have not been able to explain why @entity6 's heart was not beating when she was born			1
@entity81 , midwife matron at @entity5 , said : ' all the staff used their expertise and professionalism in ensuring @entity62 had safe , personal and effective care			0
' the staff supported @entity8 through a difficult time and we are overwhelmed that she has taken the opportunity to publicise this			0
' everyone in the unit will miss @entity8 and @entity6 , but it 's obviously brilliant that they are able to go home as a family and we wish them all the best for the future			2
' her heart began beating again after 26 minutes of emergency cpr and stayed on a ventilator for a week			1
