racing will shake up its tv tender process this summer by asking broadcasters which races they want to bid for rather than restricting them to specific packages			2
the sport is not in a position to dictate terms , in contrast to football ’s @entity10			2
the new going rate of £ 11million per live @entity10 match dwarves the £ 4.8m per year @entity15 pay for their monopoly terrestrial coverage			1
and even such an outstanding day of racing as the opening tuesday of the @entity19 saw a worrying drop in @entity15 viewing figures , with the peak of 910,000 a significant 71,000 down on the previous year ’s figure			1
@entity24 falls at the last fence on an action - packed first day at @entity19 on tuesday - but tv figures on @entity15 were still down 71,000 on last year 's event @entity30 , the tv arm of @entity32 racing , remain remarkably pleased with @entity15 ’s coverage , which runs until the end of 2016 , despite the decline in armchair watchers			1
but allowing tv networks to customise their bids means racing could separately sell its crown jewels — @entity19 , @entity40 , the @entity41 and @entity42 — to terrestrial channels			1
other marquee meetings may follow			0
this makes commercial sense , especially as racing is already well served by two subscription channels for the run - of - the - mill meetings			1
the secret of @entity53 trainer @entity52 ’s remarkable success at @entity19 may be there for all to see , emblazoned on his horse boxes parked at the @entity19			1
the promotional message is ‘ what a difference the hay makes ’			0
@entity52 gets the specially selected hay for his @entity61 stables from @entity62 in @entity63 , through supplier @entity64 , based in @entity66 , @entity67			0
they say : ‘ mr @entity52 is one of our best customers , so naturally we look after him			0
’ co-authored with @entity72 , the book will detail @entity74 's tactics and management techniques publishers @entity76 look to have already maximised their investment in sir @entity74 with two seven - figure advances and two best - selling autobiographies			1
yet @entity74 , as if £ 2m for 20 days ’ work as a @entity82 ambassador is n’t enough to augment his pension , will no doubt be trousering another £ 1m plus advance for a leadership book based on his @entity87 business school work , written with tycoon sir @entity72			1
however , one subject sure to receive little attention in the book is @entity74 ’s fall - out with @entity92 over the breeding rights to champion racehorse @entity94			1
their paths will cross only accidentally at @entity19 on thursday			2

top football agent @entity98 claims the @entity99 have not properly consulted with the middle men ahead of bringing in new regulations			0
next month ’s changes may be the subject of an injunction			0
and @entity98 — who says his stellar agency , run with @entity106 , is now the biggest in the world in terms of representing players — declared : ‘ it ’s ridiculous the @entity99 have not bothered to come and see and learn how a big football agency operates			0
they have n’t got a clue at @entity113			0
‘ they are bringing in unworkable rules without finding out about the business , especially when an agency of our size is on their doorstep			0
’ the @entity99 say they are following guidelines from @entity122 , who have passed the buck on to national associations to manage agents			0
@entity127 ’s evening out @entity128 is understood to have lost his @entity130 position presenting @entity132 tennis highlights , with the omnipresent @entity133 expected to anchor the revamped evening show at this year ’s championships			1
@entity128 inadvertently said ' rose - c * * * * * glasses ' live on air during @entity140 's @entity19 coverage @entity127 ’s move to a possible tv commentary role at @entity132 was made before his latest high - profile gaffe — inadvertently blurting out the c - word while presenting the first day of @entity140 ’s @entity19 coverage			1
@entity146 will closely examine his crystal - clear ‘ rose - c * * * * * glasses ’ blunder , described as a ‘ slip of the tongue ’ , before announcing their @entity153 team , which @entity127 was expected to lead			0
@entity154 may be playing @entity155 in a pivotal @entity157 rugby game on saturday but coach @entity158 , his assistants @entity159 and @entity161 , and several of the players were enjoying the lavish hospitality of the @entity164 , including lobster for lunch , at @entity19 yesterday			2
@entity169 stars @entity167 and @entity170 ( right ) were at @entity171 at @entity19 on wednesday			2

racing could separately sell crown jewels — @entity19 , @entity40 , the @entity41 and @entity42 — to terrestrial channels if changes are made
@entity128 understood to have lost position presenting @entity132
sir @entity74 expected to earn £ 1million for his latest book
