' the heart can not pump blood around the body in the normal way , ' he said			1
' organs suffer as a result , including the brain especially , ' said the pathologist			2
the inquest was told that @entity0 had come out of a two - year relationship with @entity74 just three days before the fatal incident			2
a doctor treating her said he had ' given in to the family 's request to discharge her early			0
' giving evidence , dr @entity80 said the patient was ' hyperactive ' when she arrived at hospital for the first time			1
but @entity0 seemed to come down from the high after about an hour			0
' she had calmed down , her temperature was down , her family was willing to look after her , she had not taken paracetamol ( along with pills )			1
i gave in and agreed to it ( discharged her ) , ' he said			1
' i was going to keep her in and observe her			0
they ( the family ) said if you 're going to observe her why ca n't we take her home ? ' i decided to go with them			1
they did not force me or persuade me			0
' i could not find the drug on @entity100 and was going towards safety than toxic			0
' he said he had not come across caffeine overdoses as part of his clinical practice to this harmful effect			0
marathon runner @entity107 , pictured , collapsed and died less than a mile before the finish line of the @entity8 last year after taking @entity4 but he said he could have rung @entity109 , a phone service where a consultant is available to offer advice about drugs			1
the doctor was unable to find information about the drug under the hospital 's online drug database			1
the inquest heard that @entity0 arrived at hospital just before 5.30am			1
she was discharged about 75 minutes later at 6.45am but returned by 10.17am and was pronounced dead at 11.56am			1

it was hard to understand			0
it was difficult to do my observation			0

she was moving the opposite way			0

dr @entity138 , who treated ms @entity0 during her second visit to hospital , said that supportive treatment may not have resulted in saving her life			2

@entity21 is described as a ' popular stimulant - based fat burner ' and the ' most potent fat burner available on the market '			0
it is meant to give the user energy and suppress the appetite , making it a key ingredient in strong diet pills and exercise supplements			2
the @entity165 's medicines watchdog @entity164 ( @entity164 ) ruled last august that it is unlicensed and that all other @entity4 containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety			1
although @entity4 is not illegal to take or possess in the @entity165 it is no longer licensed so can not be sold			1
the decision followed similar warnings around the world , including in the @entity174 and @entity175 where a man died after buying @entity4 online			1
@entity4 , most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement , can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate , said the @entity164			1
this has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide , ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks			2
@entity39 coroner @entity188 said he would be writing to the @entity189 to highlight the importance of having set protocol when certain drugs are not listed on a hospital 's database			2

' there was no evidence @entity0 had taken any illegal substances and she had no underling health problems			0
' it is quite alarming considering how death is so rare from caffeine toxicity			0

' i do n't believe she knew what effect the pills would have had when she took them			2
