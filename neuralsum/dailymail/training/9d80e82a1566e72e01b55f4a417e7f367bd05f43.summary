by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 08:54 est , 26 october 2012 a border terrier dog trapped four feet underground has been rescued using equipment usually reserved for finding earthquake survivors			1
border terrier @entity4 was found using state - of - the - art seismic detection equipment after she was trapped underground for four days when he chased a rabbit down a badger ’s sett			1
when fire crews rescued the 23 - month - old dog from the hole in @entity14 , @entity15 on wednesday , she still had the dead rabbit in his mouth			1
trapped underground : fire crews used seismic detection equipment , usually reserved for finding earthquake survivors , to find and rescue @entity4 the border terrier who was trapped 4ft underground for four days crew commander @entity26 said the team identified a series of entrances to the sett before using seismic and acoustic detection equipment to pinpoint the location of @entity33 underground			1
he said : ‘ using an acoustic listening probe , we could hear the sound of heavy breathing which we were pretty sure was an animal in distress , rather than simply a badger inside its sett			0
‘ we then used a “ snake eye ” camera and we were able to locate the dog in a 10ft long tunnel around four feet below the ground			0
‘ it would seem that the dog had become trapped in the sett with the rabbit wedged in its mouth			1
‘ this had made it impossible for the dog to breathe through its mouth and so had been struggling to breathe through its nose , hence the laboured breathing we could hear with our detection equipment			1
’ @entity4 , who was hungry and dehydrated , was taken to the vets and given fluids and antibiotics for an eye infection			2
rabbit hunting : @entity4 was trapped after she chased a rabbit down a 10ft - long badger sett			1
when she was rescued she still had the dead rabbit in his mouth she has since been reunited with his relieved owner , dairy farmer @entity69 , 50 , in @entity14 , @entity15			1
he said today : ‘ @entity4 is an adventurous dog and just chases everything she can			1
‘ she was out walking on our land and she just disappeared , we were worried sick but she ’s a tough little thing			0
‘ we ’re very relieved to have her home and she ’s enjoying all the attention she ’s getting			0
’ wife @entity78 48 , feared @entity4 was dead when the 23 - month - old dog did n't come back after going for a walk with her farmer husband @entity81 , 50 , on sunday morning			1
mother - of - three dr @entity69 , a gp , who lives on a 100 - acre farm , said : ' @entity4 and our other border terrier @entity85 , who is actually @entity4 's mother , were out in the fields with @entity81 on sunday morning when she just disappeared			1
' she does n't normally do that so we thought that she must have gone down a hole			0
' we searched all that day and the next day and just could n't find her			2
' the next day i had to go to work but my sister called the fire and rescue people and the @entity96 because we needed a licence to move badger 's setts			2
' they searched three setts and when they came to the fourth one they heard groaning from inside			0
' eyes in the dark : fire crews used a ' snake eye ' camera like this one to locate the dog down a 10ft - long badger 's sett ' they brought her out and she was a bit wobbly and collapsed			1
but we took her to the vets and she had fluids and antibiotics and is gradually recovering			0
' their 10 - year - old son @entity118 was so worried about @entity4 that he stayed with her the night she was rescued in case she stopped breathing			2
she added : ' the kids were so distressed and there was so much interest in finding her thanks to @entity126 and their @entity128 messaging			0
' @entity118 got his sleeping bag out and slept with @entity4 on the hard floor all of wednesday night to make sure she was okay			2
' she feels a bit sorry for herself at the moment but she has n't learnt her lesson			0
' we 've got a pet rabbit we keep in the garden and she is still incredibly interested in running after it			0
' it 's like she gets red mist when she sees a rabbit and ignores everything else			0
' before @entity4 could be rescued , officers from @entity143 had to get permission from @entity145 to dig up the sett because badgers are protected			2
the equipment can pick up noises from trapped victims by converting vibrations created by the victim into audible and visual signals that are then detected by the equipment			0
it is used mostly to find victims trapped under collapsed structures and earth caused by earthquakes , explosions , landslides and mine disasters .			0
