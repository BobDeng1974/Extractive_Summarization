@entity1 captain @entity0 believes the @entity3 title race is destined to ' get messy ' with @entity4 joining the champions and @entity6 in a three - way battle			1
ten - man @entity1 fought back from a goal down to draw 1 - 1 with @entity10 's table - toppers on sunday , leaving the @entity11 three points clear at the summit			1
@entity14 and @entity15 occupy second and third in the table but are unlikely challengers in the long run , meaning the @entity19 and @entity1 look likeliest to lead the chase			2
@entity1 captain won his highly - anticipated duel with @entity23 at the @entity24 on sunday @entity1 's captain sees sunday 's opponents @entity6 as obvious title contenders alongside @entity11 @entity4 @entity4 are true title contenders according to @entity0 , as the @entity19 celebrate scoring at @entity29 the weekend showdown at the @entity24 was billed as the battle of the big hitters but @entity0 believes @entity4 , who are one point better off than @entity1 and four off top spot , are ready to make it a scrap at the summit			1
' it is not fair to call it at the moment , ' said @entity0			2
' first of all we are not even close to @entity6 yet ( in the table )			2
secondly , i have seen good things from @entity6 but i have seen maybe better things from @entity4 so i guess it will all be about consistency and , with the @entity48 , it will get messy around december			1
' it is too early to call			0
five points is nothing but ( @entity6 ) have five points more than us , it is as simple as that			2
the @entity57 captain and @entity23 were involved in a titanic battle ... which @entity0 got the better of ' but it will get messy in december and january as it always does - or at least the last six years i have been here it has			1
' @entity0 was in commanding form on sunday , shutting down @entity23 in a manner no other defender has yet managed this season			1
it seemed improbable that @entity10 's side would have scored had @entity67 not been sent off in the 66th minute , with @entity0 well partnered by debutant @entity68			1
the Â£ 32million @entity69 has had a lengthy wait for his first taste of @entity73 football but was muscular and dependable in a tough opening assignment			0
@entity4 's @entity75 and @entity76 celebrate in the comprehensive 3 - 0 win at @entity15 on saturday @entity68 , on debut for @entity1 , was magnificent alongside @entity0 in defence ' he was tremendous			1
i do n't think he 's played for five months , ' said @entity0			2
' i think it is up to him how good he could be but it looks like he is eager to progress , which is important at his age ( 23 ) as he is still young			0
' obviously you can see he has all the basics to be more than a good defender			0
he will need some time , like everyone else , and with time he will improve			0
going by this performance you will be looking forward to what he can achieve			0
' as for his own display , where he at times dominated seven - goal @entity23 , the @entity1 skipper added : ' i loved it			1
i live for those moments			0
@entity95 arrives late in the box to score @entity1 's equaliser and deny @entity6 three points at the @entity24 ' people who know me know i want nothing else than to play against the big strikers week in , week out and i enjoyed every minute of it			1
' while @entity67 's red card eventually led to @entity6 's opener through @entity106 , there was a dramatic finish in store as @entity95 stepped off the bench to level against his employers of 13 years			2
having been cheered onto the pitch by the away fans , @entity95 predictably declined to celebrate			0
he is only in @entity113 until the new year , when he starts life at @entity115 , but @entity0 is pleased to have a player of his stature around until then			0
' i have said it before , he was looking really good in training and it is one more player with a lot of experiences , he has won a lot of trophies in his career and in moments like this he keeps his head cool and just finishes it , ' he said			0
' he could even have had a second but i guess that could have been a bit too much			0
