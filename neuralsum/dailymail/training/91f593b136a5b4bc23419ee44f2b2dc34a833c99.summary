@entity0 has claimed his flagship @entity2 scheme has been vindicated after evidence showed it is was helping people find work quicker and earn more			1
the @entity7 said research suggested that those receiving @entity2 are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months than those on @entity12			1
they spent an average of four days more in work during that period , earning around £ 50 more , according to the analysis			1
@entity0 said research showed those receiving @entity2 are 5 per cent more likely to find employment within four months but @entity21 said @entity2 - which starts being rolled out across the country tomorrow - was massively behind schedule and saving far less than expected			1
the system replaces a bundle of benefits - including job seekers ' allowance , tax credits and housing benefit - and is designed to prevent situations where people can be worse off taking jobs than staying on welfare			2
from tomorrow , the government begins a staggered roll - out of the benefit , for claims by single people , at a further 150 job centres			0
once this is complete , it will be available in one in three jobcentres in @entity45 , ministers say			0
about 50,000 people in selected areas have claimed the benefit since it was introduced in april 2013 - far fewer than the government originally said would be getting it by now			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity50 said : ' the only person who believes @entity0 's promises on @entity2 is @entity0 ' computer problems have also caused delays and forced ministers to write off tens of millions of pounds			1
mr @entity0 insisted it had been better to delay the scheme rather than risk problems			0
' i would rather have this work , i would rather have it that everyone 's experience as we have seen already is positive , people are going into work quicker , they are staying in work longer , and they are earning more , ' he said			0
he also said the programme was under its budget , dismissing a multi-million pound write - off of failed it			0
@entity2 credit will be used by 150 extra job centres from tomorrow ' all it systems in development , the private sector and the public sector , of course you invest in them , some bits and pieces do n't work , there 's always a certain amount of a write down and some write off , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' compared to the expenditure of something in the order of £ 2.4 billion that was originally expected we are now spending £ 1.8billion , and included in all of that we are actually spending £ 600 million on this development less than was originally expected			0
' but shadow work and pensions secretary @entity50 said : ' the only person who believes @entity0 's promises on @entity2 is @entity0			1
' @entity0 promised @entity2 would save taxpayers £ 1.7 billion in reduced error and fraud			2
but now he 's admitted the government has cut the amount of planned savings by two thirds			0
' @entity0 promised one million people would be claiming @entity2 by april 2014			1
but the latest figures show only 26,940 people on the new benefit			2
at this rate it will take 1,571 years to roll out @entity2			0
' @entity21 wants @entity2 to work and we 'll call in the @entity108 to do an immediate review of this failing programme to get a grip of the spiralling waste and delays			2
