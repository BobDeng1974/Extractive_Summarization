when police initially arrested him he pretended to be @entity47 actor @entity46 , who appeared in the @entity50 film @entity48 and the x-men films , and claimed a @entity53 spectator had thrown the bottle			1
details of his bizarre behaviour emerged on the opening day of his trial at @entity60 magistrates ’ court , which is close to the @entity62 in east @entity63			0
he later explained that he gave the name of the @entity47 actor as many people say that he looks like him , the court heard			1

@entity32 was not distracted and went on to win the race in 9.63 seconds , the second - fastest 100m ever			0
@entity38 , who was in the midst of the @entity53 @entity3 team , was confronted by judo bronze medallist @entity79 and restrained by volunteers before being arrested , the court was told			1
in a statement read to the court , miss @entity79 described how @entity38 , who had ‘ slurred speech ’ and ‘ glassy ’ eyes , pushed past her to get to the front			1
she said : ‘ he was shouting specifically at @entity32			0
things like : “ @entity32 i want you to lose			0
you are an a * * * * * * * ”			0
’ hushed anticipation : a bottle lands on the track yards from @entity32 , far left , after being thrown by @entity11 , circled top she said a volunteer asked @entity38 to return to his seat which made him angry			1
miss @entity79 then saw ‘ the man in front of me move his arm back behind his head and then forwards in a throwing motion			2
i then saw a bottle hit the track			0
’ as he started to move away , she confronted him			0
miss @entity79 said she was ' flabbergasted ' at what she had witnessed , saying : ' such behaviour is so inappropriate ' , and added : ' i was sad to miss the 100m			0
' miss @entity79 added : ‘ i was angry with what he had done which was so disrespectful			0
’ after the event , she wrote on @entity110 : ‘ a drunken spectator threw a bottle on to the track ! i have beaten him			0
’ @entity38 was originally due to stand trial in september , but this was abandoned after he was sectioned under the @entity118			2
he admits being abusive and throwing the bottle , but claims his mental illness prevented him from understanding the effect his actions would have on others			2

he said : ' in the stadium , along with the many thousands who should have been there legitimately and were watching the race in hushed anticipation , was also mr @entity38 who , it is now accepted , was unwell at the time			2
claim : @entity38 allegedly told police he was the actor @entity46 ' his conduct at the time , however , the @entity150 say , was one that was causing harassment , alarm and distress to those around him , and his conduct was one that he intended to cause harassment , alarm and distress			1
' he had somehow , without a ticket ever being found on him , made his way into very exclusive seats indeed			2
he was mingling with members of the @entity53 @entity3 team			2
indeed he would be within striking distance of a bronze medallist ms @entity79			0
' whilst there he hurled abuse towards the athletes in the final , particularly towards the eventual winner @entity32			0
' ' he threw a green @entity35 bottle in a lobbing motion that was captured on @entity176			0
this bottle landed extremely close to the athletes and it 's probably luck rather than mr @entity38 's judgment that it did not do anything far more serious			1
' mr @entity134 said : ' his conduct , that is to say the shouting and jostling , had already alarmed and disrupted those around him but throwing the bottle was a step even further and led to confrontation with ms @entity79			2
' fellow witnesses described seeing @entity38 shouting at the finalists , hurling insults at @entity32 , fellow @entity33 sprinter @entity192 , and @entity194 sprinter @entity193			2
student @entity195 said she heard him yell : ' believe in @entity192 , no @entity32			0

' at no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what i had seen , but just demanded to know who had won the race ' ' he was trying to get to the front to be closer to the athetes			0
' security guard @entity210 saw @entity38 jostling his way through the @entity53 fans and then saw him throw a bottle towards the starting blocks			1

' at no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what i had seen , but just demanded to know who had won the race , ' mr @entity210 said			0
@entity38 's dna was found on the bottle , and @entity176 footage was due to be shown to the court of him jostling @entity53 fans and athletes shortly before throwing it			1
