furthermore , with @entity20 over , it was time for our four - legged friends to show us what they have hanging in their own @entity25 wardrobes			2

no longer purely a dog show , @entity10 celebrates every aspect of the role that dogs play in our @entity131 has changed in ways that could n’t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in @entity136 times by the late @entity137			2
although it was a very different event in 1891 @entity137 was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today , which is an essential date in any dog lover ’s calendar			0

it has evolved since the 19th century , but still has this celebration of dogs at its heart			0
as organisers say : ' judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes , which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs			0
but the event is now about so much more besides			0
' @entity10 is ultimately a celebration of all dogs			2
it celebrates working dogs , which are fit and healthy enough to perform the jobs for which they were originally bred , such as those in the @entity205 classes or which line up for the @entity206 and @entity208 award , and it hails hero dogs through the @entity211 competition			0
' rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of @entity218 and @entity219 to @entity220			0
