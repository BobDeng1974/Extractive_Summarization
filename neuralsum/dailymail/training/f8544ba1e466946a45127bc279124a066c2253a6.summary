by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 05:53 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 08:28 est , 1 june 2013 a new cash - for - questions scandal threatened to engulf @entity5 last night after @entity7 mp @entity6 was snared in a sting operation			1
mr @entity6 resigned his party ’s whip after he was exposed as having accepted £ 4,000 to ask parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of @entity12			1
his resignation came as pictures emerged allegedly showing him signing a contract with a fake lobbying company set up by journalists			1
@entity6 mp has resigned as images of him meeting an undercover @entity21 reporter posing as a lobbyist were released the mp allegedly signs a contract with the fake lobbying company set up by @entity21 as the mp signs the contract he is recorded saying : ' let 's sign this , with pleasure			1
' stills from film footage released by @entity21 reportedly show the @entity32 mp signing a document during a meeting with an undercover journalist posing as a lobbyist			1
he was also recorded saying ' let 's sign this , with pleasure '			0
the mp for @entity32 announced that he will refer himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and will quit the @entity41 at the next election			1
but fellow conservatives and campaigners called for him to resign now			0
last night several other mps and peers were said to be embroiled in the scandal			0
mr @entity6 is accused of breaking commons rules by failing to declare the £ 4,000 payment to the parliamentary authorities in the register of interests			1
he was exposed in a sting operation run by the @entity21 ’s @entity21 programme and a national newspaper			0
they approached him seven weeks ago pretending to be from firm called @entity58 lobbying on behalf of @entity12			1
the fake company website that was used by @entity21 to contact @entity6 they requested his help to win readmission to the @entity63 for the @entity65 island , which was suspended in 2006 after its government was ousted by a military coup			1
friends of former army officer mr @entity6 say he was approached as he has often spoken up on behalf of @entity12 in the @entity69 , and because he ‘ looked like an easy mark ’			1
@entity71 faced pressure last night following the @entity74 scandal to bring in a right of recall so voters can sack their mps between elections			1
@entity7 mps and campaigners said the powers – promised in the @entity83 – are needed to oust those guilty of wrongdoing			0
they also urged ministers to set up a long - promised register of lobbyists			2
@entity89 , of the @entity90 ’ @entity88 , said : ‘ mr @entity6 ’s constituents should have the right to hold him to account for his actions if they feel he has let them down			0
' without a proper right of recall , mps remain able to sit out a full five - year term , regardless of their conduct			0
’ @entity7 mp @entity100 , an advocate of recall votes , said that mr @entity71 ’s @entity103 ‘ needs to come up with proposals fast ’			1
in february 2010 , mr @entity71 called lobbying ‘ the next big scandal waiting to happen ’			1
but @entity83 pledges to set up a register of lobbyists have so far come to naught			2
the mp signed a contract worth £ 2,000 a month and put down five parliamentary questions on @entity12 , all of which were answered			1
he should have declared an interest , but did not			2
on march 26 he also proposed a @entity114 motion saying ‘ there is no justification for @entity12 ’s continued suspension from the @entity63 ’ and urged the government ‘ to arrange a ministerial visit in order to help prepare for and assist its readmission ’			1
he was in the process of setting up an @entity123 on @entity12			1
the scandal is reminiscent of the cash - for - questions affair in the 1990s when two @entity7 mps accepted money in brown paper bags to ask parliamentary questions			1
the affair left the @entity7 tainted with ‘ sleaze ’ for a decade			0
@entity132 mp , @entity133 's shadow cabinet office minister , said : ' @entity71 must now address his failure to act by working with @entity133 to establish a @entity135			1
' we have seen no action from this @entity7 - led @entity118 , despite @entity71 himself warning that lobbying was the next great scandal waiting to happen			1
' the coalition agreement promised action , and cross-party support was offered			0
however , scandals around " cash for access " continue to be present at the heart of this government			0
' at a time when faith in politics and politicians is at an all time low , we must all be working hard to reinstate confidence in elected representatives and the governmental system			0
' examples such as the allegations heard in the last 24 hours are not good for @entity158 politics			0
' in a bid to stop the rot , mr @entity6 referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards , said he would be resigning the @entity7 whip for the good of his party and announced he would not stand for re-election in 2015			1
but last night it appeared that the scandal was spreading			0
the @entity21 announced that they had put allegations of wrongdoing to other mps and peers			0
@entity32 mp @entity6 today quit the @entity7 party , after 12 years on the conservative benches in the commons prime minister @entity71 has been made ' aware ' of he allegations while on holiday in @entity178 with wife @entity179 at least 20 are required to create an all - party group and @entity133 whips in the @entity181 warned their peers a week ago that a lobbying sting was in operation			1
the resignation was a mixed blessing for @entity71			1
mr @entity6 , the former commanding officer of the @entity188 regiment , has been one of the prime minister ’s fiercest internal critics since he was sacked as homeland security spokesman in 2007 after he said being called a ‘ black b * * * * * d ’ was a normal part of @entity69 life			0
@entity6 spent 25 years as an army officer with the @entity196 and @entity188 , serving in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
as the youngest colonel since the @entity201 he left the army in 1999 and soon after joined @entity205 's today programme as their defence reporter			0
he was elected as @entity7 mp for @entity32 in 2001 , and served on the frontbench under @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity71			1
but he was sacked by mr @entity71 in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a ' black b * * * * * d ' was a normal part of army life			2
he also claimed to have met a lot of ' idle and useless ' soldiers from ethnic minorities			0
since then , mr @entity6 has been an outspoken critic of the @entity7 leader			0
in 2011 he was reported to have called mr @entity71 ' an a * * * ' and ' a despicable creature without any real redeeming features '			2
a recording obtained by @entity222 suggested he also said of the pm : ' i ’ve never , ever come across anyone less suited to the job in my life			0
i would take a beggar off the streets and put him in that position rather than have @entity71			2
' however , mr @entity6 denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge			0
since then , mr @entity6 has been accused of describing mr @entity71 as a ‘ despicable creature without any real redeeming features ’			2
asked once what the prime minister ’s biggest fault was , mr @entity6 responded : ‘ being born			0
’ but if mr @entity6 is forced to resign as an mp , mr @entity71 would be presented with a potentially disastrous by - election in an area where the @entity158 @entity242 would fancy its chances of picking up its first @entity245 seat			1
the prime minister will also face questions about why the @entity83 has failed to fulfil pledges to create a state register of lobbyists and to give voters the right to ‘ recall ’ mps who have done wrong			2
critics called for mr @entity6 to retire			0
@entity7 mp @entity255 tweeted : ‘ if it ’s bad enough for you to resign from your party , how can it be ok to continue representing constituents at all ? ’ @entity90 ’ @entity88 chief executive @entity89 said : ‘ @entity32 residents will be intrigued as to why their mp has resigned from his party but not from @entity5			1
’ friends of mr @entity6 said that he had not put down the exact parliamentary questions he had been asked to , but had chosen the wording himself			1
they also claimed he had refused a request to ‘ cook the results ’ of the @entity123 report on @entity12 in order to fix the conclusions			2
‘ they tried to force his hand and he said no , ’ one friend added			0
allies said accusations that mr @entity6 had also made derogatory comments about @entity12 soldiers were ‘ rubbish ’			2
mr @entity6 was approached by @entity279 , a freelance documentary maker working for @entity21 , on tuesday			0
he discussed the affair with @entity7 chief whip sir @entity281 on thursday and suggested to party chiefs that he resign			0
mr @entity6 , who is married with a son , said : ‘ @entity21 are planning to broadcast a programme alleging that i have broken parliamentary rules			2
' i am taking legal advice about these allegations – and i have referred myself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards			2
‘ in the meantime , to save my party embarrassment , i have resigned the conservative whip			1
i have also decided not to stand at the next general election			0
’ @entity71 was informed of the situation while on holiday in @entity178			2
his spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 has done the right thing in referring himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and resigning the whip			0

allegedly caught breaking rules by reporters posing as lobbyists who asked him to carry out work on behalf of @entity12
he has asked two parliamentary questions and tabled a @entity41 motion on the island in the @entity65 but allegedly did not declare interest
@entity32 mp quit today saying he wants to ' save my party embarrassment '
@entity71 ' aware ' of allegations and backed resignation
