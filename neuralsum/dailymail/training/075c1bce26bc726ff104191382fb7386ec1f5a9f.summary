hundreds of people took to the ocean for a @entity11 swim , enthusiastically participating in an annual tradition which has become a beloved ritual in many seaside towns			2

at @entity53 , racegoers faced a struggle to keep hold of their umbrellas with strong gusts blowing through the venue			0
and coastal resorts such as @entity60 in @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 were hit with huge waves which left their beaches and promenades largely empty for most of the day			0
the @entity11 parade through @entity68 was somewhat dampened by the wet weather , while participants in the annual @entity71 in @entity72 wrapped up against the treacherous conditions			2

a fixture in @entity18 's calendar for more than 25 years , the @entity112 is part of this year 's @entity40 's @entity39 celebrations			1

' we even had a marriage proposal			0
one man popped the question to his partner after he 'd been in for the dip ... and she said yes			0
' in @entity162 , @entity16 , revellers ran along the promenade before leaping into the @entity206 at @entity177			1
and residents of @entity180 in @entity181 were not deterred by their distance from the coast , leaping into the @entity182 to celebrate the coming of the new year			1
a-hunting we shall go : members of the @entity71 were not put off by the soggy conditions in @entity214 , @entity72 heading out : members of the hunt endure the rain today as they gather for their @entity45 's meeting staying warm : a rider sips from a drink as she waits for the hunt to begin in earnest mist : the @entity72 countryside was barely visible today through a blanket of drizzle tens of thousands of people apparently poured into the streets of @entity68 for a ' swinging sixties ' @entity11 parade			1
