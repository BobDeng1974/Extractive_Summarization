in an northeastern @entity2 town , residents are dying of breathing disorders and skin diseases at alarming rates as underground fires that have raged for nearly a century continue to blanket the city in toxic smoke			1
the town of @entity12 , in @entity2 's northeastern @entity10 province , plays host to more than 70 fires which have burned continuously beneath the earth 's surface since 1916			1
here the infernos have been left to burn unhindered following a coal mine collapse in the resource - rich region - which produced a blaze so intense authorities have balked for decades at the effort required to extinguish it			2
villagers in @entity12 , @entity10 , warm themselves beside a fire made of coal scavenged from the vast mine miners work to repair a digger at the bottom of the open - cast mine , where fires have raged since 1916 the underground fires are spewing toxic fumes across the town , causing respiratory and skin diseases women scavenge coal from the area as a permanent shroud of toxic emissions blanket the sky a boy looks out over the mine which is eerily illuminated by the inferno raging beneath the earth 's crust a group of women carry baskets of coal back to their village to sell			1
many families are forced to earn a living in the dangerous area the region is resource rich with an estimated 1.5billion tonnes of untouched coal sitting beneath the surface seven - year - old @entity63 ( centre ) and her mother @entity62 ( right ) carry baskets of coal on their heads with a friend a man bathes in water which is in itself badly contaminated after spending several days scavenging coal fuelled by billions of dollars worth of coal lying under the surface , the fires cause sinkholes which twenty years ago swallowed 250 homes within four hours			1
toxic fumes - which include poisons such as sulfur , sulfur , carbon and nitrogen oxides - are a part of everyday life where coal emissions are causing devastatingly high rates of breathing disorders and skin diseases among locals			1
residents and children spend their days clamoring over the hot ground to eke out a living by chiseling out pieces of coal to sell at local markets			2
the first coal mine fire was detected in the area in 1916 and is believed to be due to a open cast mine not being correctly decommissioned			2
in the decades since , it has spread to become truly unmanageable			0
and despite repeated warnings that the town and surrounding area is on the brink of an ecological and humanitarian disaster , little has been done to help residents despite promises to move the entirety of the town			0

the government has promised to relocate locals away from the area , but this has yet to be done a young girl covered in soot collects pieces of coal to sell at the local market it is believed that if the remaining coal still sitting below the surface ( 1.5billion tonnes ) was to burn at a similar rate , the fires could last for another 3,800 years , @entity148 reported			0
photographer @entity154 visited the area last year for his award - winning photo project @entity158 is on @entity159 and described feeling as though his skin was on fire			0
in spite of horrendous living conditions , he also witnessed children making their way through the area in bare feet in order to eke out a living from what coal they could salvage			0
he said : ' at the end of every day i had a layer of coal on my clothes and my skin and sometimes and i often felt like my face was burning , ' @entity172 reported			0
' i had pretty heavy boots , but sometimes just walking around the soles almost melted off			0
' i saw young kids - six or seven years old - carrying coal with no shoes on , breathing that air			0
' a mining company employee sits down during his break at one of the area 's many coal depots flames from the underground fires burst through the surface as a local man watches from afar coal mine fires spew out from the ground			1
having burned for nearly a century , the fires have been known to cause sinkholes that swallow villagers ' homes it 's thought it would be possible to extinguish the fires , but there is a lack of political will locals load coal onto a bicycle at the coal mine , which supplies coking coal used in the production of steel a villager shows his feet , which are blackened and covered in sores , caused by walking through the area			2

the @entity2 town of @entity12 sits above *deadly* underground coal mine fires
more than 70 fires beneath the town have raged *uncontrollably* since 1916
they are causing breathing and skin diseases as well as huge sinkholes
residents are forced to live on top of the fires in order to eke out a living
