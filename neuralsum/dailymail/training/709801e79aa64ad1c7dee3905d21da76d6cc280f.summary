@entity1 has already begun manufacturing the @entity2 , which will be revealed in april and go on sale in august , it was claimed today			1
the new model is believed to look identical to the current @entity5 but include a faster processor and updated camera , according to online reports from website @entity9			1
it also claims that new @entity13 models are set to be announced in april , including a new version of the firm 's hugely successful @entity15 with an upgraded screen			2
already obsolete ? two models display the @entity5 during the product 's release at a store in @entity22 on december 14			2
an analyst has claimed production of the next @entity2 has begun and @entity1 will announce it an event in september ' @entity9 has learned that @entity1 is planning the release of the @entity2 for this summer , currently for august , ' the site said			1
' next generation @entity13 , presumably the @entity13 5 and potentially the ipad mini 2 , may also debut as soon as this april , ' it added			1
' if these plans stick , we should be in for a fun spring and summer			0
' it comes as @entity37 @entity1 blog @entity35 reported that @entity38 is starting to ramp up production of @entity1 's @entity5 successor , according to @entity41			1
it claims that because the design of the ' @entity2 ' is substantially the same as the company 's existing handset , little to no tooling is needed to manufacture the two models on the same production lines			1
leaked photo ? this image purports to show the case of the new @entity2			1
published by @entity57 website @entity55 , the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update to the latest @entity1 phone the claims echo those made by @entity62 of investment bank @entity63 earlier this year , who said @entity1 will begin making a new @entity5 model in march for an expected launch in june or july			1
mr @entity62 predicted that @entity5 sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model , but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to march			2
' as word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread , we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand @entity76 in anticipation of the new product launch and @entity1 will likely start curtailing channel inventory , ' he was quoted as saying by @entity81			2
' therefore we tweak down our @entity83 shipment estimate from @entity84 to @entity85 , which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid- @entity88			0
' the analyst 's prediction of a summer launch date for the @entity2 is a reiteration of claims he made last month , when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life			1
get the camping gear ready : eager customers queuing for an @entity5 five outside the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , when it was launched in the @entity104 last year on rumours of an entry - level @entity5 , mr @entity62 claimed @entity1 could release a low - cost device made of polycarbonate with no @entity109 ( @entity111 ) capability			1
@entity1 will launch five new products in the next 12 months , including its highly anticipated tv set , two leading analysts claimed today			0
analysts @entity116 and @entity117 of @entity118 say the firm will launch a plethora of new products in a bid to keep its position as the world 's biggest company			0
however , the analysts say the new gadgets could be just the beginning of a major change in @entity1 's products in 2014			0
the pair told @entity132 ' will set the stage for bigger changes in the product lineup in 2014 and beyond			0
' @entity1 is believed to develop products several years in advance , with its design team , led by @entity104 - born sir @entity139 , producing hundreds of prototype products each year			1
the speculation seemed to contradict comments made by @entity143 , @entity1 's marketing chief , who recently told @entity145 newspaper the @entity146 that ' despite the popularity of cheap smartphones , this well never be the future of @entity1 's products			0
' mr @entity62 's predictions came as a string of analysts suggested that @entity1 's decision to slash orders for @entity5 components might not be a result of weak demand for the device			2
earlier this year , @entity160 reported how the iconic gadget company had told suppliers it only wanted half the number of screens it had originally asked for and reduced orders for other parts too			0
@entity1 is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month			0
it will apply to orders from now until the end of march and comes after @entity1 has come under intense pressure from @entity173 and other phones which use @entity177 â€™s @entity176 operating system			0
but @entity178 , an analyst with brokers @entity179 , was quoted by the @entity181 as telling investors that ' as far as we can tell , @entity5 demand remains robust			0
' he added that the change in orders could be down to ' much improved yields meaning lower component builds and supplier shifts			0
