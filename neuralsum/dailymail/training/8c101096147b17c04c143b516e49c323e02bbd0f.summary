they 're seen as the easy targets during election campaigns by graffiti gangs and have often been the subject of battles between political candidates - but the defacing of election billboards or corflutes , as they are also known , is going to become a costly past - time now in @entity11			1
with less than a month before the @entity11 election ( september 20 ) some of the @entity13 political parties are getting all high - tech on vandals , installing hidden cameras to monitor their advertising boards			1
police will be provided with the images of anyone caught on camera defacing the corflutes corflutes do n't come cheap , just one can cost $ 10			1
the @entity25 says that the @entity26 has confirmed that some electioneering teams are already using motion sensor cameras and any act of vandalism or theft is passed onto police			2
if successfully prosecuted , vandals can be fined or , in the worst cases , face imprisonment			0

another @entity26 politician claims more than 100 of his were destroyed in the first weeks of the campaign			1
it 's not a problem restricted to @entity11 , of course			0
some graffiti can be fairly basic but others go to great lengths , including going as far as transforming a conservative candidate to resemble an outrageous rock idol all @entity11 parties have been targeted			2

during the 2012 @entity62 elections , then @entity60 @entity59 was targeted by vandals spraying @entity65 symbols on his boards			0
@entity69 's @entity68 mp , @entity68 , was one of those to have his signage damaged during last year 's election campaign , as did his @entity73 counterpart , @entity72			0
