@entity1 , @entity2 : it 's a long way from @entity4 — and a long way from the @entity7 homes of @entity8 and @entity9			1
the pair mischievously claimed that @entity12 's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at @entity19 , but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current olympiad			2
@entity8 may have already been well known in @entity22 prior to their achievements in @entity25 , but taking up his part in a charming double act with @entity9 only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights			1
@entity9 ( leff ) lands a right jab on @entity34 during his bantamweight bout in @entity36 in 2014 the reality of making that happen is far more complex , of course , and the efforts of @entity8 and @entity9 to make it to @entity42 are unprecedented			1
on saturday night , the @entity7 boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer 's @entity45 , with @entity8 needing to ensure victory while @entity9 must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere			1
their mission takes them to @entity49 , northern @entity2 , where they will take on native opposition , the latest stop on the road - trip that is the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) — a part of the convoluted new structure that once was ' amateur ' boxing			1
@entity54 boxers are part of a franchise team , fighting individually over five three - minute rounds in a pro-style format			2
@entity8 and @entity64 box for the @entity66 team , but the sights and sounds of @entity69 and @entity70 were not what drew them to the competition			1
in fact , they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in @entity79 and while most @entity54 fighters receive payment , the @entity22 pair signed up with @entity45 qualification as their sole motivation			2
upon their return to @entity7 after saturday night 's fight , they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips			1
that is the equivalent of three trips from @entity93 to @entity94			2
they will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and , as of today , @entity8 has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to @entity9 's 28			1
they are burnt out , peeved off and ready for rest — but only once their mission is complete saturday night			1
@entity8 is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in @entity102 ' i just feel tired , i 'm sick of it , ' laments a worn - out @entity8 , who is an undefeated 6 - 0			1
' to fight every fortnight , travelling around the world , it 's doing my head clean in			2
i 'll be glad to get out of it			2
hopefully i qualify and some good will have come from it			2
' i was flying to @entity112 and i felt like crying on the plane , i felt like pulling out			0
i was very , very close			0
i think i was in @entity114 and i was going to get a plane back to @entity7			0
' if i did n't qualify for the @entity45 through this @entity54 , i 'd have nothing to do with it			2
i 've been training from november right through and then i 'd need to go to the @entity117 [ games ] in june — i could n't do that , like			2
i physically could n't do that , it 'd be impossible			0
' in addition to hand injuries , which have severely limited his training , @entity8 has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first @entity22 boxer ever to reach a third @entity45			1
' i hate flying , i just hate it , it depresses me even thinking about it			0
i ca n't even sleep , i 'm that scared			0
i ca n't sleep , ca n't watch films , ca n't read books , i 'm just too panicky , too nervous			0
' i 'll not even be able to drink water , never mind a beer to relax , because i 'll be making weight			0
' if he sounds like a touch grouchy , it is understandable			0
while their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity146 's @entity145 , @entity147 in @entity112 , @entity70 , @entity69 and now @entity49 , the two - time @entity45 medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities			1
' far from it , ' says @entity8			1
' you go away and you have to go to the worst areas , there 's nothing extravagant about it			0
it 's not five star — it 's one - and - a - half star			0
' you ca n't really see too much because we 're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we 're training to make the weight … we 're home the next day [ after the fight ] in the early hours			0
so we 're more or less in and out			0
' @entity9 ( left ) and @entity8 sport their bronze medals following their success at @entity19 adding to @entity8 ' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light - flyweight limit			1
the 28 - year - old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh - in demeanour are common , with @entity9 witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room - mate			1
' it does make it easier because we 're mates outside boxing , ' says @entity8 of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal			1
' we 're travelling together and fighting together so it is good , i 'd rather that then going away on my own because i think i 'd pack it in			0
it 's too much of a strain			0
' but when we 're away , i barely talk to him because he knows i 'm making weight ! ' @entity9 , the laidback member of the double act , takes a far more carefree approach to travel			1
' getting on a plane does n't bother me , if you 're going to die on a plane , you 're going to die , ' laughs @entity9			1
' a lot of the flights i try and sleep through so i 'll be waking up in their [ local ] time			0
' the 23 - year - old recently became a father , with his young daughter just four weeks old , while @entity8 is also a father to a daughter of 11 months			1
the pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since @entity9 emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend 's presence on @entity54 duty			1
' it 's good for both of us because i know when i 'm training with him , we 're both training hard and pushing each other , ' says @entity9			1
' everything we 've done up until this @entity54 since 2012 has been the exact same — @entity45 bronze , @entity117 silver , @entity225 gold			0
the fact that this @entity54 has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we 're still going well , ' adds @entity9 , who is in qualification limbo after two disputed ' away ' points decisions , increasing the temptation to turn pro			2
' winning [ tonight ] is n't going to be a problem , i 'm just waiting on other results			0
it 's a bit of a sickener , but it has to be done at the end of the day			0
i have to get in there and do what i have to do and win , do my part of the job			0
' ' i 'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me , but i have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things , ' says @entity9			2
' hopefully it all works out			0
if it 's meant to be , it 's meant to be			0
' for @entity8 , he maintains : ' the @entity45 is what it 's all about , it 's every amateur boxer 's dream and if i qualify , i 'll be honoured to say i qualified for my third @entity45			1
