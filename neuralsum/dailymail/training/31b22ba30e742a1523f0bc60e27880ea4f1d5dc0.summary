she gleefully tortured suspects , falsely claimed the tactics worked , and lost key information that could have prevented the 9/11 attacks			1
and then she got a raise			0
this is the @entity7 's queen of torture			2
the unnamed detective - who remains a prominent figure of the administration - was mentioned at least 36 times in the @entity7 's damning report on the use torture as a means of interrogation , according to @entity18 's investigative reporter @entity17			1
but despite identifying other officials , report authors opted to shroud the woman from the public sphere , only revealing that she is 49 years old and formerly the deputy chief of the @entity25 unit			2
however , one passage recounts how the @entity29 expert told a @entity39 committee : ' there 's no question , in my mind , that having that detainee information has saved hundreds , conservatively speaking , of @entity47 lives			1
' her statement came after she had personally waterboarded @entity50 , one of @entity29 's leading operatives who was detained in @entity52			2
and when another detainee stated that @entity50 tried to recruited two @entity55 converts in @entity56 , she falsely told @entity7 officials he was targeting any @entity47 national muslims			1
she closed the email with the words : ' i love the @entity55 at @entity62 in @entity63 ( sic )			0
... @entity64 ( @entity50 ) is going to be hatin ' life on this one '			0
when she was interviewed about the interrogations in 2003 , and claimed they drew life - saving intelligence that led to an arrest , the @entity39 report stated : ' these representations were almost entirely inaccurate			0
' by this point , the expert was deputy chief of @entity74 , also known as the @entity25 unit			0
she has now surpassed the civilian rank of general			0
track record : one passage reveals how she waterboarded alleged 9/11 plotter @entity50 the expert reached this level despite facing a storm of criticism in 2001			2
a member of her team refused to tell the @entity88 the names of @entity90 and @entity91 - two of the 9/11 suicide terrorists			1
the expert was fiercely condemned for the blunder			0
despite @entity7 's fierce bid to protect the expert 's identity , she has been named before , @entity18 reveals			1
according to the station , she was one of a number of women who inspired @entity103 's character in @entity104 - the @entity105 retelling of @entity25 's killing			2
however , the administration implored @entity18 to refrain from identifying the woman for fear of retaliation			0
a former senior @entity7 officer , @entity111 , told @entity18 : ' she 's an extraordinarily capable analyst			1
' she has a caustic personality , but she is frighteningly intelligent and knows more about @entity29 than virtually anyone else at the @entity7			1
' she 's hard to manage but brings a lot to the table ... she was n't afraid to make mistakes			0

@entity7 report *slamming* torture tactics identifies senior *female* expert
her name was redacted from the report 36 times despite naming others
she waterboarded a key @entity29 operative - but told @entity7 officials he was targeting any @entity47 @entity132 rather than two converts in @entity56
this came after a member of her team *neglected* to share information with the @entity88 that could have stopped 9/11 attacks
she has been named before and was one of @entity104 's inspirations
*insiders* say she is ' frighteningly intelligent ' and knows more about @entity29 than any other @entity7 officer
