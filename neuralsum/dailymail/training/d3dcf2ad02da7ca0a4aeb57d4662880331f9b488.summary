by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 16 january 2013 the parents of a boy shot dead in the @entity4 school massacre have called for gun control laws to be passed immediately			1
@entity6 was one of 20 children and six teachers killed at @entity6 in @entity10 , @entity11 , last month by gunman @entity12			1
the @entity13 - born six - year - old had moved to the @entity4 with his family , including older brother @entity16 , from @entity17 in @entity18 two years ago			1
all the shootings that have come before have indeed been terrible tragedies , but now it 's sunk so low that very small children have now been the target of this			2
' how could it possibly get worse ? if they can not address this now , it 's as if they think they can never address it and they will give up and this will go on			0
' during the interview , @entity51 's mother @entity26 told how she looked for her son at the school after the shootings			0
leaning on each other : @entity57 ( left ) , who lost her daughter @entity58 , reaches out to @entity59 whose son @entity51 also died in the @entity6 massacre grief : @entity25 holds a photo of his six - year - old son @entity51 on the one - month anniversary of his death as he attends a press conference with his wife @entity26 ( right ) ' after a while , as the kids were all leaving with their parents , you just start wandering around thinking , " where 's mine ? " , ' she said			1
' the police confirmed that 20 children had been shot and the room erupted			1
and i remember i started shaking - and i just could n't stop for the life of me , ' said mrs @entity59			2
protector : @entity51 's parents said that they were comforted to know that their son had died in the arms of his beloved teacher @entity85 @entity51 's body was found in the embrace of his classroom assistant , @entity85			2
' @entity51 was wrapped in mrs @entity85 's arms , " said mrs @entity59			0
" she was protecting several children , but @entity51 was the one that was actually in her arms			2
and that helps a little bit			0
' president @entity96 is expected to put pressure on @entity98 to come up with ' concrete proposals ' on tighter gun control , a spokesman said			1
but the move is certain to spark opposition from @entity103 in @entity98 and from pro-gun lobby organisation the @entity105 @entity4 still seem to support gun control one month after the massacre with a @entity109 / @entity108 poll published yesterday showing that 52 per cent say they support gun controls in the wake of @entity10			1
as the @entity113 try to come to terms with the devastating loss of their son , they have decided to move house as driving past the home of gunman @entity12 is more than they can cope with each day			0
mrs @entity59 said : ' you ca n't drive up your driveway every day and see the house of a person who took your son 's life and who brought so much pain to so many people			0
' @entity51 's older brother @entity16 is also struggling to come to terms with the loss of his sibling and the many questions he has as to why this happened			0
never forget : photos of @entity6 victims sit at a small memorial near the school a month after the atrocity unbearable : the @entity25 family have decided to move to another part of @entity10 , @entity11 as they can currently see the @entity144 property from their home			0

@entity13 - born six - year - old was one of 20 children and six teachers killed
devastated parents fear moves for tighter gun controls will be *abandoned*
