@entity0 was accused of disrespecting his former club @entity2 as @entity3 produced yet another familiar evening of agonising failure in the last 16 of the @entity5			1
despite winning 2 - 0 in @entity2 and producing an exhilarating finale as they pushed for the elusive third goal they needed , @entity0 's team ultimately ended up out of the competition at this stage of the @entity5 for the fifth successive year			1
and to add to their woes @entity2 manager @entity13 accused @entity0 and @entity3 of disrespecting him and his club after not congratulating @entity2 following their 3 - 1 victory in the first - leg at the @entity20			1
@entity2 celebrate their win in the dressing room as @entity3 failed to qualify for the quarter - finals former @entity2 manager @entity0 ( right ) gestures during the match as @entity3 looked for an upset it was a frustrating night for @entity0 at his former club as @entity3 failed to overturn their 3 - 1 deficit @entity0 holds his head in his hand on a frustrating night in @entity2 for the @entity3 manager @entity3 manager @entity0 complains to the officials as his side crashed out of the @entity5 the @entity36 manager left without shaking @entity0 's hand after his side 's progressed to the quarter - finals and said : ' it 's true in first leg when i wanted to shake a hand , @entity0 did n't thank me and shake my hand			1
so this time even though @entity2 did everything for @entity3 , i decided not to thank him			1
asked whether @entity0 was disrespectful , @entity13 said : ' i think so and right now we 're celebrating and we think that @entity3 maybe did n't show all the respect that they should have in the first leg			1
' @entity3 were very happy to play @entity2 as we were supposed to be one of the weakest teams			2
all the teams in the last 16 wanted to play against @entity2			2
maybe @entity3 thought they had qualified already			2
' the row completed a bitterly disappointing night for @entity3 which ended in the usual glorious defeat over the two legs with @entity0 admitting that his team had paid the price for a calamitous first - leg performance			1

the @entity3 manager said : ' football is not a fairytale			2
it 's just a matter of being realistic and clinical and @entity2 were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well			2
the performance was enough today but of course we had difficult task i believe as well it could have been over at half time with the chances we had			0
' overall we paid for fact that we did n't produce game we wanted in the first leg			0
they surprised as first leg too sure of ourselves			0
but @entity2 played at home tonight and had zero shots on target			0
we knew before game we had a 98 per chance to go out			0
we did fight but i felt some players were jaded offensively as given a lot of saturday and lacked bit of freshness			0
' the anguish of their repeated failures at this stage of competition was expressed by defender @entity113 , who said : ' we say same thing every year			0
our first game is catastrophic			0
we have to put it right and play well in two games			0
' @entity2 coach @entity13 reacts on the pitch at the end of their @entity5 win on aggregate it proved a good night for @entity2 president @entity123 ( right ) and his daughter @entity124 ( left ) @entity0 's team have now gone out in the last 16 for five years running with their exit often accompanied by lamentable first legs and spectacular yet fruitless comebacks			1
ultimately @entity2 will be filed alongside the 3 - 0 home win against @entity130 in 2012 and the 2 - 0 win at @entity132 in 2013 as yet another brave failure			1

we 're very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we 're on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently			0
@entity74 said : ' we came here and have nearly done it but that seems to be the case every year			0
