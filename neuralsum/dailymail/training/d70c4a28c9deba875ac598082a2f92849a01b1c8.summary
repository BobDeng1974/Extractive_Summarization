by @entity0 per @entity1 was irritated after the victory over @entity3			1
his post-match rant at a tv reporter has since gone viral			2
at one point , the @entity7 defender told his victim : ' i do n’t know what you want from me '			2
the comment summed up @entity15 ’s @entity14			1
before this tournament , all the talk was of results , and results alone			0
it was all very well playing lovely , revolutionary football , people said , but where were the trophies ? where was the @entity27 efficiency of yesteryear ? now , @entity31 ’s team have rediscovered that efficiency , people are asking where the beautiful football has gone			1
gone are the breathtaking counter attacks and the endless goals ; replaced by a more possession based game which @entity31 has honed over the last few years			0
with the exception of @entity46 , @entity15 are no longer destroying teams like they did four years ago			1
over the last few weeks , there has been many a wistful newspaper column , longing for the ' @entity61 ' of 2010			0
@entity31 ’s tactics , saying he is too obsessed with innovation , too rigid in his quest for modern football			2
there are other reasons though			0
in 2010 , teams still believed they could outplay @entity15			1
they were punished for that belief			0
@entity15 are forced to scrap , to be ruthless and efficient			1
@entity72 suffered the same issue in 2010 , winning many games 1 - 0 , but ultimately claiming the title			0
having a ball : @entity77 ( centre ) shares a joke with his team - mates in training on monday nonetheless , the trend is to blame @entity31			0
most say he has no @entity83 , while also complaining that he is constantly coming up with new ideas			0
whether he plays @entity85 at right back or in midfield , he is criticised for it			2
if his team plays nice football , people want efficiency			2
if they play efficiently , people want nice football			1
but if he wins the @entity14 , all will be forgiven			1
the trophy itself is all that matters this summer			0
@entity95 , head of the @entity27 fa , told the @entity97 on tuesday that @entity15 ’s place in the @entity100 rankings was proof enough of their success in recent years			1
he is the only one who believes that now			0
low has now had three shots at winning a major tournament , all of them unsuccessful			2
this is probably his last chance			0
at every round of this tournament , fans and media alike have been speculating that he might leave - an inconvenience he always used to be spared			0
captain fantastic : @entity85 is equally adept deployed in midfield or at full back @entity119 : @entity85 highlights the @entity27 fa may declare their full faith in @entity31 , but if @entity15 do fail this time , having played as they have , it will be fatal for his reputation			1
this time , he will have failed to win , and failed to entertain			2
as for the next hurdle on the way to glory , @entity15 know that @entity51 is the biggest challenge yet			1
they are not letting @entity129 ’s injury allow them to be complacent			0
' we know we will come up against a strong @entity133 team			0
they are hard , they play differently these days , ' warned @entity136 this week			2
they also know that they have more quality than @entity51 , but it is not the players @entity15 fears			1
just as the country has no faith in their own coach , they are fearful of his @entity133 counterpart			0
in the only other @entity14 game between these two countries , the final of 2002 , it was @entity154 who led the @entity133 to victory			1
@entity136 described him as " our biggest opponent " before tuesday ’s game			2
revenge mission : @entity15 lost the 2002 @entity14 final 2 - 0 to @entity51 back home , the game is approached with more caution than expectation			1
since 2006 , both the @entity27 team and the @entity27 fans have seen the @entity14 as a party			1
they have relaxed , done their own thing , and enjoyed the show			0
this year , the joy has been dampened slightly			0
where before , @entity15 games were greeted with excitement and euphoria , now they are greeted tentatively			1
for both the fans and the team , the freedom and the excitement is gone			0
it has been replaced only by grim determination to finally win the @entity14 again			1
going for glory : @entity15 know they are just two wins away from lifting the @entity14 @entity184 : @entity15 highlights			1

@entity15 play @entity51 on tuesday night in the @entity14 *semi-final*
@entity189 's side criticised in @entity15 for lack of style in their football
per @entity1 hit out at journalist who criticised @entity15
low has been manager since 2006 and always *encouraged* attacking football
low unlikely to keep his *job* if @entity15 do *n't* win @entity14
