during the 19th century @entity0 in @entity1 would have entertained polite company in their settlements while wearing a thong made of seal fur			1
traditionally known as a ' naatsit ' , the underwear is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman using strips of seal pelt			2
it is currently on display at the @entity13 in @entity14 as part of its animal - skin clothing collection			1
traditionally known as a ' naatsit ' , the underwear ( pictured ) is adorned with beads and would have been sewn together by a woman , for a woman , using strips of seal pelt			2
it is currently on display at the @entity13 in @entity14 as part of its animal - skin clothing collection @entity24 , the @entity13 of @entity27 's @entity26 fur clothing expert , told @entity28 at @entity29 the underwear would have been worn inside the homes of the @entity0 - even in front of guests or when visiting family members			1
it was obtained during an expedition to the @entity38 settlement in @entity1 in 1892 by captain @entity39			1
when leaving the settlement , the female wearer would have worn it under trousers			2
the naatsit was the only undergarment the @entity0 would have worn next to their bare skin and it was often decorated with beads of glass , with the seal fur turned outside			1
example have also been decorated with small pieces of fur in different colours			2
it was obtained during an expedition to the @entity38 settlement in @entity1 in 1892 by captain @entity39			1
when leaving a settlement , the female wearer would have worn this naastit ( pictured ) under trousers seals are found along the coast of @entity1 and are hunted by @entity0 ( stock image ) for their meat and skin			1
seal fur provides less insulation than caribou fur to prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp , and later freeze in the cold @entity71 from the @entity72 said : ' when weather conditions permitted , the naatsit was often the only garment worn , both in the home and outside in the settlement			1
' these homes would have been built to keep in the heat , with a low corridor entrance positioned in such a way to cause warm air to rise from beneath the structure into the home , and stay there			0
in addition to the naatsit , the @entity13 of @entity27 's collection also features a diaper made from reindeer fur ( pictured ) many of these primitive buildings would have housed more than one family			1
' there does seem to have been a taboo against walking around outside the home only in shorts , ' continued ms @entity71			0
' as soon as the @entity0 men left their own settlement , they put on a pair of long trousers made of seal or polar - bear fur			1
' seals are found along the coast of @entity1 and are hunted for their meat and skin			1
inuits across the region , and into @entity110 and @entity111 , would have also made garments from the skin and fur of reindeer and caribou			1
the severe conditions of the region means that clothes have to protect against the cold , wind and damp and seal fur , in particular , provides less insulation than caribou fur			2
this prevents the wearer from sweating and causing the material to become damp , and later freeze in the cold , continued mr @entity24			0
women would clean the skin and remove all traces of flesh to prevent them from rotting , a pricess called ' flensing '			0
the fat would be scraped away on a board called a qapiarpik and the clothing would have been sewn together using a sakkeq or ulu - a traditional woman ’s knife - and a needle			0
the display also contains a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur ( pictured )			1
a similar collection is on display at the @entity72 , which came via the museum in @entity14 in 17th century @entity151 , sorcerers wore ' trousers ' made of a dead friend 's skin that were said to bring them wealth ( example pictured ) in 17th century @entity151 , sorcerers wore ' trousers ' made of a dead friend 's skin that were said to bring them wealth			1
according to legend , a morbid deal was struck between two friends to arrange who became the trousers or ' necropants , ' which were used for purposes of traditional magic at the time			0
the @entity171 in @entity172 , @entity151 , houses the only known intact pair of necropants , that were meant to be worn day and night by their owner			0
in order to make the necropants ( called nábrók in the naive tongue ) an individual had to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death			0
the surviving member of the pact had to dig up his dead friend 's body and peel off the skin of the corpse from the waist down in one piece without any holes or scratches , to make the magical trousers			0
as soon as they stepped into the pants , the skin of the corpse stuck to theirs own , according to the museum , which documents 17th century occult practices			2
to make the grim garment , the wearer of the pants had to steal a coin from a poor widow at @entity209 , @entity210 or @entity211 and place it in the scrotum of the trousers , along with the magical sign called nábrókarstafur , which is drawn on a piece of paper			0
the coin is a ' tool to gather wealth by supernatural means , ' according to the spokesman			0
it drew money into the scrotum from living people so ' it will never be empty ' as long as the original coin is not removed , according to folklore			0
many of these techniques and tools are used today			0
when @entity230 arrived in @entity1 from the end of the 19th century they introduced new materials , and modern - day garments are often a mixture of old techniques and newer fabrics			1
in addition to the naatsit , the @entity13 of @entity27 's collection also features a diaper and a pair of pantyhose made from reindeer skin and fur			1
a similar collection is on display at the @entity72 , which came via the museum in @entity14			0
during the 1930s , @entity249 biologist and @entity251 winner , @entity250 , lived in @entity1 and collected objects of ethnographic interest			2
he donated an @entity1 kayak and two kayak anoraks to the museum of ethnology			2
many other items were provided by @entity260 from the 1970s who conducted research in @entity110 and the arctic region			0
this includes hunting equipment , and clothing .			0
