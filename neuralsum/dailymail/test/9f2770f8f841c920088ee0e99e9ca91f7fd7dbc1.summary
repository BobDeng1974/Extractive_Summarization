@entity1 under 18s boss @entity0 , whose side take on @entity3 in the first leg of the @entity5 on monday , is aiming to emulate @entity7 's famous class of ' 92			1
@entity0 , himself let go by his current employers as a teenager , could field a starting xi of players all born in @entity13 for the clash against the favoured opponents from west @entity16			1
and , while it may be unlikely anyone will emulate a golden generation across town that yielded the likes of the @entity22 brothers , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , the @entity28 winger believes that is the target			2
@entity1 under 18s manager @entity0 wants to deliver local players to the first team @entity0 talks with @entity1 elite development squad coach @entity32 ' it could happen again but they were freak years , ' @entity0 said			1
' you look at @entity7 as a one - off , @entity38 the same			2
' our job is to recruit local lads			2
if we can get a group of @entity13 - born lads into the first team then that 's the ideal scenario			1
to do that is going to be really difficult but that 's the challenge			0
' the first leg will take place under lights at the impressive , newly - opened 7,200 - capacity stadium within the grounds of the £ 200m @entity52 , a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within			1
@entity0 believes those facilities , coupled with elite coaching , stand @entity1 in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent			1
@entity0 hopes to emulate @entity7 's ' class of 92 ' but says it will be very difficult ' we do n't want local lads playing for @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity3 , ' he said			1
' it 's up to us to make sure that , via the scouting , we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme			0
i 'm convinced once they see us it 's very difficult to walk away from			0
' will the final , between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players , be a chance to stick two fingers up to @entity84 chairman @entity83 , who a year ago described the lack of @entity88 talent at @entity1 as ' pretty depressing ' ? @entity0 does not want to get into that			1
' there ’s a lot of media attention from @entity83 with regards to increasing the home - grown quota , ' he said			0
@entity0 believes @entity1 's new @entity96 campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters a look inside one of the gyms at @entity1 's training complex ' we ca n’t get embroiled in that because , for us , it ’s a day - to - day question of how do we improve players ? ' proposals have already been put forward with regards to home - grown quotas			1
if he ( @entity83 ) wants to increase it , then that is up to him			0
but whether you increase or lower the numbers , it does n’t change the fact that you have to be good enough to get through			0
' @entity0 knows all about being good enough to get through at a club where money is no object			2
the @entity123 youngster , who joined @entity124 at 14 , was the only youth product to regularly appear in their @entity128 - fuelled @entity127 triumph in 1995			1
' when i was a young player at @entity124 @entity128 came in and brought @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , ' he said			2
@entity1 's @entity132 ( left ) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against @entity134 ' you go two ways			2
do i go elsewhere and take my chances or have i got stomach for fight and see what happens ? luckily for me i was the only homegrown player which was a great privilege			0
now i 'm passing my experience to younger ones			0
' @entity0 's arrival at @entity145 came after rejection at none other than @entity1			1
' i ’d joined @entity1 at 13 and got released at 14 , ' he recalled			2
' it ’s quite fitting really because when i ’m speaking to younger players i can always recall that chat if you like			0
i think at that time it was a case of i just got told that they were not going to retain me on a year ’s contract			0
' it was devastating at the time			0
everything was going really well			0
but to be told that it is tough for a young kid			0
but i just recall my own experience whenever i have to tell the lads and have the younger age groups			0
you have to go through some period in your life like that where not everything is going to go fantastically well			0
' @entity0 was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for @entity124 during title - winning season city manager @entity171 will be at the @entity52 , as will @entity173 chief @entity172			1
things have not gone according to plan for the @entity176 's first team this season , but does @entity0 believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club 's only silverware this season ? ' not really , ' he said			1
' at the start of the year , irrespective of what was happening at first - team level , the @entity5 was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and i think it ’s great that they are being put under a bit of pressure			1
' aided by @entity0 's wise head , they appear to be thriving under it .			2
