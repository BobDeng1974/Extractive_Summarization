a windowless room awaits @entity1 on sunday			1
whatever the result at @entity5 , @entity3 's manager will take a right in the tunnel and enter @entity9 ’s self - proclaimed ‘ @entity8 ’			1
it ’s the ominous - sounding office of @entity11 and where the manager has been plotting the downfall of @entity16 football ’s biggest name for the last six days			1
@entity17 will slip inside to share a bottle of red post-match , but has been warned he may have to bring his own			1
video see @entity1 on whether he will rotate his @entity3 starting eleven @entity9 manager @entity11 and team captain @entity21 after their @entity23 second round victory @entity3 and @entity1 are @entity9 's next opposition in the tournament ‘ there are no windows , ’ @entity11 told @entity26 before a game he puts up there with the biggest in their history			1
‘ if it ’s fresh air he wants then we ’ll have to go outside			2
’ ‘ unfortunately if @entity36 wants an expensive bottle of wine in my office afterwards he ’s going to have to bring it with him - he ’s probably got a stash somewhere in his kit bag			1
we ’ll go for a mediocre red , but if he wants a real top one then i ’ll be happy to share			2
’ how much they are willing to spend on a decent @entity47 is n’t the only thing that ’s a little different about these two clubs			2
@entity9 ’s weekly wage budget stands at £ 37,500 - the amount @entity52 earns in a single day			1
@entity53 takes home more in a month than the minnows shell out in a year			0
not that it really bothers @entity11 , who is the epitome of pragmatism but holds that sparkle which fills this small town with hope of an unlikely upset to match their greatest ever against @entity64 in 1947			1
incidentally , the prize for that scalp was an 8 - 0 drubbing against sunday ’s opposition			0
@entity52 earns the same amount in a day as the whole @entity9 squad does in a week @entity3 captain @entity53 earns more money in a month than @entity9 's whole squad does in a year @entity73 annual wage budget : £ 2m home capacity : 9,565 position : 24th in @entity77 @entity3 annual wage budget : £ 215m home capacity : 75,635 position : 3rd in @entity81 ‘ we ’d like to keep our reputation as a good @entity23 side , ’ he added			1
‘ we ’ve told all the new lads that @entity9 were the best non-league team for cup upsets for years , and that we do well when we ’re the underdogs			2
we ’re certainly the underdogs here by a million miles			0
’ they are even more up against it than when the draw was made , with @entity11 fully admitting that @entity9 have taken their eye off the ball since beating @entity94 in the second round replay			1
none more so than on monday , when they were battered 3 - 0 at home against @entity99 in a defeat which leaves them rock bottom of @entity77			0
‘ some of the players subconsciously saved themselves in that game and lost their place for @entity3			0
they will learn from that pretty quick			0
@entity11 and @entity17 will share a bottle of red wine after sunday 's game but @entity11 revealed @entity17 may have to bring his own wine if he has expensive taste ‘ if @entity36 watched us against @entity99 he ’d probably feel they could put out their under 14s against us			1
‘ we ’ve had to get those games out of the way first if you like			0
this is a different kettle of fish			0
hopefully the boys will go in with a different feeling , without the pressure of the points			0
now it ’s finally here we just ca n’t wait			0
’ @entity11 - who says his experience managing @entity126 stands him in good stead for games such as this - can not be far off legend status in this pocket of the @entity133			2
he was the man who won promotion to the @entity135 in 2003 and then did the unthinkable by taking @entity9 to the @entity136 two years ago			2
‘ if we win they might even put a statute up of me , ’ he laughed			0
‘ i reckon i ’ve earned one already , but the chairman says i ’ve got to do a little bit more yet			0
i ’m only 5 ’ 7 ” so it would n’t take a lot of metal , would it ? ’ @entity11 ’s side are going to have to show more than a bit of mettle if they want to inflict anything worse than a cheap bottle of wine on @entity17 .			1

@entity153 travel to @entity9 for their @entity23 clash
@entity1 and @entity11 will share a drink after the match
but @entity11 said @entity17 may have to bring his own bottle of wine
