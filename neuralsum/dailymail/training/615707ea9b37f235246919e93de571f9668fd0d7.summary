by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 4 december 2013 if you want to make sure your @entity3 cards arrive on time , spending an extra 10p on a first class stamp seems like the obvious thing to do			1
but you ’ll be wasting your money , a consumer champion warned yesterday – because of a little known get - out clause in @entity12 ’s delivery targets			0
the rules , laid down by the regulator @entity14 , state that @entity12 must aim to deliver 93 per cent of first class post on the next working day			1
but between december 2 and december 31 , these rules are scrapped			1
first class : last year , only one in two @entity3 cards posted first class arrived the next working day , although @entity12 beat its target between april and september ( file picture ) last year , only one in two @entity3 cards posted first class arrived the next working day , although @entity12 beat its target between april and september			1
in fact , over the festive period , second class post is typically more reliable			1
under the regulator ’s rules , @entity12 must aim to deliver 98.5 per cent of second class letters within three working days			1
last @entity3 , it achieved a rate of 93.1 per cent – yet second class stamps are 10p cheaper than first class , which currently cost a record high of 60p			2
@entity37 , director of postal policy at @entity38 , the watchdog which published the research , said ‘ cheaper second class ’ post is a ‘ super savers tip ’			2
his advice came as @entity12 promised that postal workers will not strike over ‘ the whole of the @entity3 trading period ’			1
yesterday ’s announcement triggered a sharp jump in the firm ’s share price , which closed yesterday at an all - time high of £ 5.90			0
strikes : @entity12 promised that postal workers will not strike over the whole of the @entity3 trading period that ’s 80 per cent higher than when it was privatised last month , further fuelling fears that the company was sold too cheaply			1
the low price has been widely criticised by @entity60 , amid fears the sale has robbed the taxpayer of billions of pounds			0
bankers involved in the flotation told mps on the business select committee the strike threat was the main reason the shares were priced as low as £ 3.30			0
@entity71 , managing director of @entity72 , said : ‘ it [ the strike threat ] was the most significant factor in terms of the pricing of the deal			0
’ @entity84 , managing director of @entity85 , said : ‘ i would say at that point , as we have just discussed , the threat of industrial action and the fact that the strike ballot was due just after the closing of the original timetable was a factor			0
’ but @entity12 and the @entity89 ’ @entity88 have finally reached a deal following marathon talks , which began last year , about workers ’ pay , pensions and terms and conditions			2
no details of the agreement were published yesterday because they must first be considered by the @entity100 ’s bosses and be agreed by its members in a ballot			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity100 has confirmed that there will be no disruption through industrial action during the ratification process of the proposed agreement , including the whole of the @entity3 trading period			2
’ this year the last posting date for second class mail is december 18			0
for first class it is december 20 , and for the more expensive ‘ special delivery guaranteed ’ service it is december 23 .			0

@entity12 must deliver 93 per cent of first class post next working day
between december 2 and december 31 , these rules are scrapped
@entity12 promised that postal workers will not strike over @entity3
