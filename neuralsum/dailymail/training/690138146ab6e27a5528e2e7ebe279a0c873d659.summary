dr @entity32 , chief science officer of the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) said : ' the benefits are largely perceptual			0
' people think the degree of sweat is the quality of the workout , but that 's not reality			0
' it does n't correlate to more calories			0
' @entity33 sponsored a small study at the @entity45 , in which researchers who monitored two dozen healthy adults during regular and hot yoga classes found no difference in the increase in core temperature or heart rate between the two 60 - minute sessions			1

she said : ' to burn calories , your body requires oxygen			0
the harder the exercise , the more oxygen you require and the harder you breathe			0
' your heart may need to work a little harder to keep your muscles oxygenated ( and to cool the body down ) in a @entity6 class , but this would be no different than in many other yoga classes particularly a dynamic power yoga session , which can be quite cardio - driven and very hot and sweaty			1
' evidence on the scales after a @entity6 yoga class can be mistaken for fat burn rather than fluid loss , but the sweating alone does not burn fat			1
