by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 will not sign a new contract at @entity3 and is set to instead join @entity4 in a deal worth around £ 3.5million as he looks to fulfil his ambition for @entity8 football			1
forest owner @entity9 has challenged @entity10 , 23 , to put pen to paper on a deal first offered in february but it is understood that the terms are significantly less than other team - mates and he has informed manager @entity16 of his intention to leave			1
@entity4 boss @entity18 is keen on the midfielder , who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the @entity22 from @entity23 for £ 1m in 2012 , and would offer regular game time			1
off you go : @entity1 has snubbed a new offer from @entity3 and is set to join @entity4 getting ready : @entity1 trains with @entity3 ahead of the new season it is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without @entity16 ’s full knowledge , after the sales of @entity32 and @entity33 , with negotiations advancing between officials from @entity3 and @entity4 until @entity1 told his manager about his desire to go last week			1
@entity16 has since reluctantly agreed to sanction the move if the right bid is made , rather than have an unhappy player in his squad , and there is still work to be done over a price			1
@entity3 are believed to be holding out for a fee nearer £ 5m			1
@entity16 and @entity9 have been locked in a war of words after @entity47 and @entity33 were sold to @entity48 for a combined £ 7m before being loaned back for the season			1
one - time @entity50 : @entity1 began his career at @entity23 before joining @entity3 in 2012 international star : @entity10 is also a former @entity53 under 21 star , winning 16 caps for the @entity53 @entity16 said the transfers were conducted without his knowledge , adding : ‘ i am not prepared to fluff things when it comes to what was said and done behind the scenes			1
two players were sold against my will			0
’ @entity65 hit back and claimed the manager had been consulted , saying : ‘ the manager and i openly discussed the proposed sale of @entity33 and @entity32 and he was aware of the negotiations throughout			1
‘ sadly for me , there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long - term sustainability of @entity3			1
’ @entity65 then discussed @entity10 , explaining : ‘ clearly he is a talented player who we do n’t want to lose			0
he rejected my offer of a new contract earlier this year but that deal remains on the table			2
‘ he has two more years to run on his current contract and we hope he will play a huge part for us this season			0
it is now time for @entity1 to make his decision			2
’ stars : but @entity32 and @entity33 were sold on the cheap to @entity8 side @entity48 dispute : @entity9 has hit back at @entity16 's claims he was left in the dark at @entity3 @entity16 has said publicly he does not want to lose @entity10 , a graduate of the @entity23 academy , and called him one of the @entity97 ’s best players			1
but the former @entity99 boss is aware of the pressures to meet financial fair play			0
@entity16 said : ‘ i certainly hope we will not be losing any other players			2
the only ones i would want to move out is the ones i give the proviso to move out , who are not helpful to me			0
‘ if i get asked the question , i will give an honest answer over who should and should n't go			0
hopefully , more often than not , the owners will take my guidance on that			0
‘ i would n't want @entity1 to go			2
i know there 's been interest , but i would not want him to go			0
that is where i stand on him			0
i 've had a long connection with him at international level and i want that to continue at club level			0
‘ he is one of the better players in the @entity97 , if not one of the best in the top echelons of the division overall			0
can he play in the @entity8 ? yes he can in my opinion			2
‘ there 's been interest in @entity1 , but nothing anywhere near our valuation			2
we all turned it down – we are in unity on that one			0
