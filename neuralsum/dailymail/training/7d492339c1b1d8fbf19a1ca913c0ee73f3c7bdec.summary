dozens of @entity1 could be forced from their home by a scorching hot lava flow which has been oozing towards them for months			0
officials are preparing to evacuate residents of @entity6 , on the @entity7 of @entity7 , after the stream of molten rock came within a kilometer of the settlement			1
the flow , which is 230 yards wide , is now advancing at ten yards per hour , kicking up toxic fumes as it burns over an asphalt road			1
@entity23 erupts constantly , but the lava usually flows away from settlements			1
the current flow has been slowly approaching @entity6 since june			1
it 's not clear exactly when it might reach the village road as the flow has been advancing erratically , said @entity29 , a geologist with the @entity30			1
danger : the flows could destroy homes and buildings , as well as kicking off toxic fumes as it burns down its trajectory			0
the molten rock can also cause dangerous methane explosions along its track usually lava from @entity23 , which started erupting in 1983 , flows south , enveloping the @entity43 and @entity44 residential subdivisions as it poured out to sea			1
for the past two years , however , the lava has been flowing to the northeast , bringing it to @entity6 's doorsteps			1
officials were going door - to door to about 50 homes to keep residents informed of the lava 's movement , said @entity55 , the director of civil defense for @entity7			2
' this is all something we 've been preparing for and hoping would n't have to happen , ' @entity55 said			0
the county will issue a mandatory evacuation order if the flow begins advancing at such a rate that it would be difficult for people to move out of the way with little notice , @entity55 said			2
burning asphalt was generating some smoke , but @entity55 said the wind dispersed the fumes over unpopulated areas and it did n't pose a health risk at the moment			0
@entity55 said the current situation differs from the flows of past decades because the lava is now approaching the center of a community			0
@entity6 is not only more densely populated , he said , but it also has commercial and industrial sites as well as residential homes			2
@entity81 : the lava has oozed towards @entity6 since june , when flows from the @entity23 volcano changed path cooler : in the photograph above , geologists walk along a cooled lava flow higher up the stream the current flow that has been threatening @entity6 began in june			1
it 's been moving fitfully toward the town for weeks , speeding up and then slowing down			0
sporadic suspensions in the lava 's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway			0
crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from the lava 's heat			0
the lava 's pace picked up in recent days when it reached a gully , allowing it to move more efficiently like rain in a gutter			0
@entity7 gov. @entity117 on friday asked for a presidential disaster declaration to enable federal help for local emergency crews .			2
