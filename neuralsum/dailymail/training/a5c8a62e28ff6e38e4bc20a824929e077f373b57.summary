the pictures , taken by the @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity12 programme , show that bees ' colours range from blue to green , that some have no stripes and that their shapes range from large bumblebees to those as small as a grain of rice			1
there are more than 4,000 bee species in @entity24 alone , with 20,000 worldwide , and the programme has spent nearly 10 years capturing the insects and documenting them in stunning detail			2
the pictures , taken by the @entity29 @entity28 and monitoring program , show that bees colours range from blue to green , that some have no stripes and that their shapes range from large bumblebees to those as small as a grain of rice @entity36 , 55 , the head of the programme , said that each macro photo is a composite of between 20 and 300 individual photos , taken at slightly different distances			1
this gives a great depth of field and allows the bees to be studied more closely			2
‘ only after accidentally meeting up with researchers in the @entity47 did we develop the current hi - res system , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity49 developed the basics so that they could receive high quality pictures of pests from foreign bases that they could then identify to species			0

‘ we modified their approach in late 2010 and have now taken shots of over 500 species of bees and other species			0
‘ bees come in so many different shapes and sizes because there are so many sizes and shapes to flowers - the two co-evolved together and created specialised systems where certain species of bees only pollinate certain species of plants , using their special bee tools and bee abilities			1
‘ these colours seem unconventional only because people do n't pay too much attention			0
‘ they are common , native species , which we usually ignore because they are small and do n't sting us - each has evolved different colours and shapes to best fit their lifestyle			1

' they are common , native species , which we usually ignore because they are small and do n't sting us , ' said @entity36 , who led the photography team ‘ bees are found everywhere - in the middle of fields , urban areas , gardens and even in marshes where they forage on blooming wetland plants			2
‘ most people are completely oblivious to the existence of the many species of small solitary bees nesting in their lawns because they do not sting and do n't match our mind picture of what a bee should look like			2
‘ i love creating keys for identification , the challenge of hunting for bees in the field , and the simple enjoyment of looking at beautiful animals under the microscope for hours at a time			0
