the @entity1 volunteer told @entity12 : ' when @entity4 was attacking the @entity22 and they had fled to the mountain , an @entity55 helicopter with a western journalist went to drop water			1
' women and children rushed in and started piling into the chopper			2
' the cameraman filmed this one mother holding her 10 or 11 - year - old son			2
he was dressed for school it seemed			2
' she was crying , holding him			0
he was looking at the camera and that look of sheer terror in his eyes overwhelmed me with emotions i have never felt before			0
' i actually became physically ill and was crying uncontrollably			0
this has never happened to me before , and that was it			0
' i knew i had to come , and never in the month before coming here did i have any doubt			0
for @entity13 it was a life - changing moment and in an instant he made the decision to leave behind his family , friends and even his beloved @entity84 shepherd dog , @entity85 , to go and fight			1
after travelling via @entity86 he arrived in the @entity87 of @entity55 on october 28 , but he did not inform those close to him until five days later , when he posted a statement on his @entity91 page on november 2			0
@entity13 told @entity12 he waited before telling his family because he wanted to make sure he had made the right decision to join the battle			2
in the post he revealed he had moved to @entity30 , a small @entity5 town near the @entity98 border , and had started training with @entity33 fighters			1
@entity13 wrote : ' the @entity34 is training me , until i am ready , then join the fight against @entity102 ( @entity4 )			1
' the only way to try to explain this , is that i heard @entity17 's call			1
‘ the @entity2 are the most amazing people , i ’m so very blessed			2
‘ i ’m not much for words except i love you all my friends , i ’m in very good hands			0
’ since then , @entity13 has been completing his military training and doing his best to learn the @entity33 language			1
he told @entity12 : ' i have been embedded with other foreigners and many @entity2 speak some @entity113			0
' most speak at least two languages , some know more			0
' many years travelling the world and learning martial arts had given him a ' mental toughness , ' he added			0
@entity13 ( pictured ) is a committed surfer who has vowed to surf the @entity121 when @entity4 is defeated @entity122 more used to beaches than the tough terrain of northern @entity5 where he is now in training to fight @entity13 waited five days before announcing his decision to join the fight against @entity4 on @entity91			1
many of his friends and family have supported his decision to join the battle against the @entity133 militants he also insisted the @entity34 had been careful not to throw him straight into the fiercest fighting , but had been training him on the quiet parts of the frontline			1
he said : ' i am in good hands here			0
the experienced military guys go to where the real fighting is			0
' maybe i 'll stay and live here afterwards			0
the @entity2 are the most gracious , respectful people i have ever met			2
‘ we are family now			0
i am so honoured to be here			0
' but for all the excitement of his new life as a warrior , @entity13 did admit to missing his favourite pastime , surfing			2
he said : ' i will always surf ’ , adding he has sworn to take to the waves in the @entity121 when @entity4 is defeated			1
despite his apparently baffling decision , many friends and family members have expressed support for @entity13 ’s choice on social media			2
' i ca n't tell you how good it is to see you looking so strong and healthy , ' one wrote			0
' your determination to make a difference just shows your heart and qualities			0
your family and friends are so very proud of you			0
' ' you are our hero , ' wrote another			0
' @entity13 claims he is ' so very blessed ' to be fighting @entity4 has developed a fearsome reputation both on and off the battlefield , particularly when dealing with foreigners			1
they have posted a series of videos showing the murders of @entity1 journalists @entity175 and @entity177 , @entity1 aid worker @entity178 and @entity181 aid workers @entity179 and @entity182			0
but @entity13 says he will stay and fight until the group is pushed out of @entity33 land , something he estimated would take up to two years			1

' the @entity2 are the most gracious , respectful people i have ever met			2

' they call themselves the @entity29 and boast : ' it is better to live one day as a @entity228 than a thousand days as a sheep			1
' they are the foreign fighters who have travelled to @entity5 not for jihad , but to join the @entity2 who are defending their communities against the advance of @entity4			1
just as hundreds of young @entity234 have gone to fight for the radical islamists of @entity25 , so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies , the @entity2			1
@entity239 @entity238 is a high profile member of the @entity29 of @entity30			1
her death was wrongly reported by @entity4 militants recently @entity243 , a former @entity1 soldier now with the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , operates @entity244 openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight			1
just as many of the @entity25 's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of @entity251 youth worldwide , many of the initial @entity34 volunteers have come from the @entity33 diaspora			1
in august a hairdresser from south @entity256 was reported to be the first @entity257 to travel to fight alongside @entity33 forces			1
ethnic @entity2 @entity259 from @entity260 , 26 , travelled to @entity55 to join the @entity33 peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt @entity25 's lightning advance			1
among the many @entity264 fighters joining the @entity29 of @entity30 in their campaign to defeat @entity4 are @entity266 from @entity267 , @entity268 ( left ) and @entity269 ( right ) from @entity270 in @entity271 but since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against @entity25 , including fellow @entity181 soldier duo @entity269 , a 26 - year - old from @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity266 , 24 , from @entity276			1
last month it was reported that a currently serving @entity181 marine had been questioned by police who suspected he was travelling to fight with @entity33 militias during his leave			1
the 22 - year - old @entity283 was quizzed after he prepared to fly from @entity285 on a one - way ticket to @entity98			0
he was suspected of being in contact with @entity33 militant groups			2
two women , @entity290 , 31 , and @entity291 , 20 , have also reportedly travelled to fight with the @entity2 , inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against @entity25 terrorists			1
fighters march under the black banner of @entity25 , which is locked in battle with the @entity34 it is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict			1
there are also claims that a number of @entity234 biker gangs have travelled to @entity5 and are helping to assist the resistance			0
leaders of the @entity311 - based @entity310 , which has strong @entity33 links , have posted images of their @entity84 riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons			2
the news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the @entity320 were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to @entity322 to join the fight against @entity4 .			2
