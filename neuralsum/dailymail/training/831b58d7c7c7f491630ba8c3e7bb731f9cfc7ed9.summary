by @entity0 a mother who was acquitted of killing her ex-husband 20 years ago has been sentenced to up to 41 years for shooting and paralyzing her adult son with the same gun			1
@entity6 , 66 , was found guilty in april of attempted murder , battery with a deadly weapon and intimidating a witness for the june 2011 attack on her son , @entity12 , in their @entity14 home			1
on wednesday , she cried as she was sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison and told the judge that she had been wrongfully convicted , the @entity16 reported			1
it comes more than two decades after she was cleared in the death of her former husband @entity21 on february 7 , 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle			2
she claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife			0
he had initially told police that his father 's hands were empty when he saw him killed on the floor , but in the 1993 trial in @entity43 , @entity44 he said that his father may have been holding something			0
in 2011 , she shot @entity12 in the neck in @entity14 with the same @entity49 after an argument about his girlfriend , whom @entity6 had been accused of stalking			1
again , @entity6 , a former legal secretary , claimed she shot out of self defense after her 6ft 9 inch son , a bouncer at a local club , had attacked her during the argument			1
and again - he defended his mother			0
paralyzed : @entity34 , who was shot in the neck , testified in court ( pictured ) that he was to blame in court : @entity62 , another son of @entity6 , listens as his mother is sentenced to prison on wednesday testifying from a motorized chair , he said that she had shot him after he attacked her			1
he said that he blamed himself for the incident			0
denial : @entity6 said that she had killed her ex-husband @entity67 , pictured , in 1992 in self defense but his testimony was at odds with other statements made in the court ; an ex-girlfriend testified that he told her his mother shot him as he sat on the couch			1
the argument that led to the 2011 shooting came after years of tension over @entity34 's girlfriend , @entity78 , whom he met in 2009 but did not tell his mother			2
@entity78 told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting @entity6 because she was ' crazy and it would cause nothing but problems '			0
and when @entity6 did finally meet @entity78 , she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a series of texts calling her a ' stripper , ' ' w * * * * , ' ' prostitute ' and ' skank '			0
she also contacted a non-profit cancer organization where @entity78 volunteered and said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs , prosecutors said			0
prosecutors added that @entity78 was genuinely fearful of @entity6 , and this led to the argument on june 28 , 2011			0
police received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from @entity6 and one from @entity12 's younger brother , @entity101 , a @entity14 police officer			2
freed : her son testified in the 90s that he might have seen his father with a knife and @entity6 was freed home : they argued over @entity12 's girlfriend , whom @entity6 had allegedly called a ' skank ' and ' w * * * * ' but the calls came after a 15 - minute call between @entity6 and @entity101			1
by this point , @entity12 had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not feel his legs			0
when @entity101 called police , he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him , and @entity6 called police to say her son had been shot in the neck			1
@entity6 refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son , although at one point said : ' the gun , it 's my fault , it 's my fault			2
' when police arrived , @entity12 was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him , he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident			2
questions were also raised when @entity6 contacted her son via a cell phone while he was in hospital .			0

@entity6 was acquitted after claiming she shot her ex-husband , @entity21 , in 1992 in self defense as he came at her with a knife
in 2011 , she shot her son @entity12 in the neck with the same gun , also claiming that he was attacking her as they argued about his girlfriend
@entity12 , who was left *partially* paralyzed by the *injury* , defended his mother throughout the case - although other witnesses *pinned* blame on her
in april she was found guilty of attempted murder and on wednesday , she was sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison
