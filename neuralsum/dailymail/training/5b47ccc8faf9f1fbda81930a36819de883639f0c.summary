@entity1 's @entity0 reached her second successive grand slam semi-final on tuesday , defeating third seed @entity3 in straight sets in the @entity5			1
@entity0 , who lost to eventual winner @entity6 in the last four of the @entity7 last year , needed just 69 minutes to overpower @entity3 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 in the day 's first quarter - final on @entity9			1
neither player had lost a set in the previous four rounds but it was @entity0 who always looked the most likely winner , racing into a 3 - 0 lead with two breaks of serve as @entity3 committed a string of unforced errors			1
@entity0 celebrates beating @entity3 and booking her spot in the semi-finals @entity3 was blown away in the second set and was beaten 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 the 23 - year - old @entity22 did recover one of the breaks to register her first game and held to trail 2 - 4 , but could not find another breakthrough as @entity0 made the most of her swinging left - handed serve			1
the no 11 seed @entity0 , 26 , then cruised through the second set to set up a semi-final with either second seed @entity30 or seventh seed @entity31			1
@entity0 was in dominant form as she blasted her way into the semi-finals in 69 minutes @entity3 had no answers as she was comprehensively beaten by @entity0 ' it 's a great feeling , i 'm so happy that i came through , ' @entity0 said in an on - court interview			1
' she is a tough opponent and i lost to her ( in their only previous meeting ) two years ago			2
she never gives up , she is always fighting and every point is long			0
' it was really tough and i am happy that i stayed solid and in my game			0
' i was used to being in quarter - finals ( in grand slams ) so now i have to get used to being in semi-finals			2
' @entity0 and @entity3 shake hands at the end of their quarter final match @entity0 looks happy as she signs autographs for fans at the end of her quarter final @entity3 admitted she lost belief in the second set , adding : ' i practised very well in the morning , but maybe i was a little bit too stressed before i started the match			1
i had a bad day but she played well and everything was in for her so she deserves to win			0
' i 'm really sad a little bit now that i could not play my tennis , my game , but that 's tennis and i have to look forward to the next tournament			2
' i can not say ( it was ) pressure			0
just i was a little bit stressed			0
i do n't know why			0
i had experience from last year of playing quarter - finals , so it does n't mean that i felt pressure			2
' but sometimes you can not manage the situation , just mentally because during the points maybe i did n't fight very well today			0
i just lost my concentration to win the points , to win the match			0
so i did n't believe any more in the second set , and that 's maybe why i lost 6 - 0			1

@entity0 beat @entity3 6 - 4 , 6 - 0
@entity0 needed just an hour and nine minutes to *progress*
@entity0 has yet to drop a set in this year 's @entity5
