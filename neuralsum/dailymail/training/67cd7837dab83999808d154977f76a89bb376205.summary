by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 20:32 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:32 est , 29 december 2013 conservationists are fighting to save a native plant that is growing wild in only one site in @entity8			1
there are only 13 @entity10 in the @entity11 on the @entity12 and they are failing to regenerate			1
a team from the @entity14 and @entity15 are now growing specimens at a nursery and hope to plant them in the wild in the coming year			1
rare : the @entity21 , a rare variant of the more ordinary juniper bush , pictured , is in danger of dying out the @entity10 juniper was historically recorded at several sites on the @entity27 , grazing by animals , reduction in fertility by ageing plants and male and female fragmentation are believed to be behind the decline			2
in the last 30 years regeneration rates are believed to have been very low - in 2010 , detailed surveys found no natural regeneration at all			2
@entity39 , from @entity15 , said the people of @entity8 should be ' very proud of the @entity10 ’s botanical importance '			1
it has a number of rare species			2
cuttings from all known wild juniper plants on the @entity10 were taken in 2010 to the @entity14 in @entity8			1
fruit was collected from five wild female plants two years later with the aim to grow plants from the seeds			0
both methods are now being used to help grow junipers			1
' the 13 individuals live close together [ in the wild ] and we want to see if former sites where they used to be found might be suitable for the reintroduction , ' mr @entity39 said			1
' it will help protect them if something bad happens to those in the @entity11			0
' growth : campaigners from the @entity14 , pictured , are trying to grow new specimens in a nursery dr @entity67 , from the @entity14 , said seedlings had been germinated from the collected seeds , but they had to be ' robust enough ' before being reintroduced			1
' it ’s part of our native flora and we need to do more to understand why there has been such a strong decline , ' he said			0
' the species was once abundant and we should endeavour to keep it			0
' the plant is a subspecies of the juniper , an evergreen conifer			0
mr @entity39 said the lizard was the only place in the @entity83 where it was found			2
but he admitted there was some divide in the scientific community as to whether a type of juniper found in southern @entity89 was the same subspecies			0
he said : ' they live in different habitats , there would be no gene flow between the two populations , and they do differ , but at this stage it ’s unclear whether it is the same subspecies or not			0
' dr @entity99 , who is one of the founders of the project , said : ' it ’s a very important project , not just for conserving one population of plants , but also understanding the scientific methods of how best to protect our habitats and plants			0
' he added the research methods used for the @entity21 , as a case study , could help towards safeguarding other species .			0

there are only 13 lizard junipers left on the the @entity12
the @entity14 and @entity15 are growing specimens at a nursery
