humans can work out a dog 's mood just by the sound of its bark , according to new research humans can work out a dog 's mood just by the sound of its bark , according to new research			1
people use the same rules to work out how their dog is feeling , as they do to determine the emotional state of friends			1
the study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion			2
researchers from @entity23 , @entity24 , said that shorter barks sounded more positive and higher pitched noises more intense			1
dr @entity27 , part of @entity30 - @entity29 based at the university , said : ‘ humans are extremely good at recognising other 's emotions based on their behaviour or even voice			2
‘ we were curious when they hear a human laugh , cry or the calls of our close companion the dog , whether they use the same acoustical rules to assess the caller 's inner state			1
‘ we found the most important features of both dog and human sounds were the length of the sound and its pitch			1
’ the findings confirm what many dog owners have long claimed , that they can tell if their pet is happy , sad , angry or afraid , based purely on its different barks			1
scientists used to believe that barking is a random noise without any specific information or content			0
but evidence at dr @entity27 's @entity61 - one of the world 's first facilities dedicated to the human - dog relationships – has revealed that there is more to it			2
a study found that owners listen to the length and pitch of the barks their dogs make to understand their canine companion			2
shorter barks were found to sound more positive and higher pitched noises more intense in the study , 39 volunteers listened to 200 recordings of dogs and humans ( where the humans made noises but did not speak ) and were then asked to score them on a scale measuring emotions			1
dr @entity27 said that in both dog and human samples the shorter the calls the more positively they were rated			1
higher pitched samples were also marked as ‘ more intense in both species ' vocalisations			1
’ the research , published in the @entity94 journal @entity95 , is the first to directly compare how people perceive human and dog sounds			1
previous studies found that humans can assess the emotions of dogs based on their barks , but the new research involved a much wider range of noises			1
‘ we used several different dog calls like growls , whines , moans and similarly the human sounds we played back were pretty diverse , ’ dr @entity27 told @entity106			2
the research enabled him to directly compare what parameters can affect the assessment of emotions in dogs and humans			0
dr @entity27 said : ‘ we show humans use similar acoustical parameters to attribute emotional valence and intensity to both human and dog vocalisations			1
’ together with earlier studies , the research suggests the general rules discovered could be applied to other mammal noises and bird sounds , although this has yet to be proven			2
he believes the findings may even be used in the future for improving interactions between people and artificial intelligence			0
‘ using these rules we can develop artificial emotion expressions that can be easily recognised and can be used in social robots or other devices , ’ he added			0
this week scientists revealed that the ' puppy dog eyes ' expression that dogs make taps into our subconscious			0
research by the @entity149 found dogs that raise their inner brows , to make their eyes appear larger , are chosen by prospective owners more quickly than other dogs			0
the study suggests that dogs have evolved in response to the human preference towards childlike faces			0
in conjunction with the @entity162 , researchers used a newly developed tool called @entity164 to analyse dogs ’ facial expressions			0
they studied every muscle movement made by 27 dogs in re-homing shelters when a person came and stood in front of their pen			0
the tool counted the number of times the dogs raised their inner brows and widened their eyes as a prospective owner approached			0
dogs that produced more of these movements attracted an owner quicker with their ‘ child - like ’ expression than those that did not			0
lead author , dr @entity185 , an expert in the evolution of social communication at the university , believes the results of the study suggest that wolves which produced childlike expressions may have been more tolerated by humans , and so modern dogs have inherited these features .			0

researchers from @entity23 , @entity24 , said shorter barks sound more positive and high pitched noises seem more intense to humans
people use the same rules to work out how their dog is feeling , as they do to determine the emotional state of friends
