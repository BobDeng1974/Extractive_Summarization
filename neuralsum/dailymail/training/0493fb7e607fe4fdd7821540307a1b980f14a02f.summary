the @entity2 special prosecutors ' office that investigates @entity4 war crimes is recommending charges against dozens of alleged former @entity7 guards , opening the possibility of a new wave of trials almost 70 years after the end of @entity12 federal prosecutor @entity13 , the head of the office in @entity15 , said an investigation of 49 suspects turned up enough evidence to recommend that state prosecutors pursue charges of accessory to murder against 30 people in @entity2 who were stationed at the death camp in @entity4 - occupied @entity25			1
another seven suspects who live outside the country are still being investigated , two could not be found , and one further case has already gone to prosecutors , he said			2
those living abroad are in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 , @entity25 and even one in @entity36 , @entity13 said without giving further details			1
@entity2 @entity13 ( left ) , head of @entity38 of the @entity39 of the @entity40 for @entity41 and @entity42 ( right ) , minister of justice in @entity2 state @entity44 , @entity15 , @entity2 , today the notorious @entity46 sign at the gate to the @entity7 @entity4 concentration camp in @entity49 , @entity25 the names and hometowns of the suspects were not released			1
@entity13 said the oldest suspect was born in 1916 and the youngest in 1926 , meaning they could range in age from 86 to 97			1
the cases are being sent to the responsible state prosecutors ' offices in 11 of @entity2 's 16 states			2
it will be up to them to determine whether the elderly suspects - primarily men but also some women - are fit to stand trial and whether to bring official charges			2
" the biggest enemy is time , " @entity13 told reporters			0
accessory to murder charges can be filed under the same legal theory that @entity72 prosecutors used to try former @entity74 autoworker @entity73 , who died in a @entity76 nursing home last year while appealing his 2011 conviction on charges he served as a @entity80 death camp guard , @entity13 said			1
up to his neck : director of the @entity38 of the @entity83 for the @entity41 , @entity13 , stands between filing shelves in @entity15 , @entity2 @entity85 - born @entity73 was the first person convicted in @entity2 solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard , with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing			1
under the new legal argument , anyone who was involved in the operation of a death camp was an accessory to murder			1
@entity73 steadfastly maintained that he had been mistaken for someone else and never served as a camp guard			0
@entity98 , the top @entity4 hunter at the @entity99 in @entity100 , said the decision could mean even more cases will be opened against guards at the other five main death camps established by the @entity105			2
@entity85 - born @entity73 , above , was the first person convicted in @entity2 solely on the basis of serving as a camp guard , with no evidence of involvement in a specific killing " we commend the ( prosecutors ) for seeking to apply the precedent as widely as possible and hope that they will be able to find as many perpetrators as possible , " he said in a telephone interview			1
" it 's only a shame that this kind of legal reasoning was not applied previously , because it would have led to many , many more cases of people who definitely deserved to be brought to justice			0
" @entity13 said that even guards who worked in a death camp 's kitchens played a role in the facility 's function as a site that existed for the purpose of mass murder			1
@entity13 cautioned that the health of the suspects - and of possible witnesses - would make bringing them to trial difficult			0
" i do n't want to raise excessive expectations , " he said			0
the @entity105 built six main death camps , all in occupied @entity25 : @entity7 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity80 and @entity141			1
the @entity7 and @entity140 complexes also had labor camps associated with them , but @entity13 said the suspects in the current investigation all worked in the main death camp , known as @entity7			1
as part of the investigation prosecutors surveyed anew the @entity7 and concluded no one could have been there for more than a day or two without learning that people were being gassed to death and their bodies incinerated at the site , he said			2
about 1.5 million people , primarily @entity154 , were killed at the @entity7 camp complex alone between 1940 and 1945			0
overall , about 6 million @entity154 died in the @entity156			0
@entity13 's office is now focusing on the other death camps , starting with investigating all former personnel at @entity140			0
he said expects to announce results of the @entity140 probe within six months			0
@entity42 ( r ) , minister of justice in @entity2 state @entity44 speaks during a press conference in @entity15 , southwestern @entity2 , today			0
@entity42 ( left ) , minister of justice in @entity2 state @entity44 speaks next to @entity2 @entity13 ( right ) investigators are also looking into former members of the so - called " einsatzgruppen " - death squads that were responsible for mass killings , particularly early in the war before the death camps were established , @entity13 said			2
he said he did not see extending the @entity73 precedent , however , to the @entity105 ' network of hundreds of concentration camps - places like @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 - where many tens of thousands died but whose purpose was not solely extermination			0
in cases of guards from those camps , prosecutors still need evidence of a specific crime in order to bring charges , he said .			0
