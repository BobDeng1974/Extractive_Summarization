champions : @entity2 will play world champions @entity4 as part of their build - up to @entity16 repeat : @entity28 's men will also face @entity7 , who beat the @entity2 2 - 1 during the @entity30 in @entity31 speaking after a @entity33 meeting in @entity34 , @entity9 said : ' we have got a set of friendlies to go with the qualifiers right through to march 2016 all arranged			1
' we will be playing the bigger @entity40 countries - it makes more sense to prepare for a @entity40 tournament by playing @entity40 opposition so we have put less of an emphasis on non-europeans over the next two years			2
' home and away we will be playing @entity8 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity4			0
' @entity2 will play @entity22 with only the lower tier of @entity21 occupied by fans due to low ticket sales			1
@entity9 added : ' we are expecting 35 - 40,000			0
it will be the lowest crowd we have had at @entity21 , the average @entity2 gate is 79,000 so it is disappointing			0
chance to lead : @entity2 's new captain @entity54 will have the opportunity to play against top opposition tought tests : @entity28 's men will prepare for the next major tournaments by facing @entity33 's best sides ' we have got some work to do , we have to rebuild a squad which is @entity28 's department , and we have got to rebuild some trust with the supporters			1
' we have got incredible loyal supporters , we had 5,000 who went to @entity31 and were disappointed , and we are working hard on what we can give them , what content , what what price we can give them to make them feel part of the @entity2 experience			0
loyal support : the fans who followed @entity2 to @entity31 were magnificent but were not matched by the players ' we have relaunched our @entity2 supporters club , we are aiming to get half a million members and ultimately attract a brand new audience to fill 70,000 general admission seats five times a year			2
' @entity9 said the low ticket sales should not cause any financial problems for the @entity10			1
' we did n't budget for a big crowd for this game			0
it 's traditionally a difficult sell , ' he said			0
' we will be a little bit down on budget but not a lot and i 'm pretty confident it wo n't cause us any difficulties			0
