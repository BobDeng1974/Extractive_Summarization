by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:23 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 06:26 est , 31 december 2012 train travellers have reacted angrily as they face fare rises of up to 10 per cent from this week - but rather than having sympathy for them , the transport minister has claimed the increase is ‘ only right ’			1
@entity8 countered the damning evidence from pressure groups of overcrowding and poor punctuality by insisting the government is carrying out its biggest rail investment in two centuries			2
the 55 - year - old @entity16 added that ministers are ‘ determined to reduce the cost of running the railways ’ in the longer term so ‘ we can end the era of above - inflation fare rises ’			0
@entity23 increase : train travellers face fare rises of up to 10 per cent from this week mr @entity8 said : ‘ family budgets are being squeezed , so that is why this coalition government has taken proactive steps to cut the planned fare rises from 3 to 1 per cent above inflation until 2014			2
‘ this decision puts an average of £ 45 per year back into the pockets of over a quarter of a million annual season ticket - holders			1
‘ many more holders of weekly and monthly season tickets could also see lower fares and some commuters could be over £ 100 better off			1
’ research by @entity41 found season tickets on some rail services have gone up by 40 per cent since the start of the recession			1
and car park charges are rising by 25 per cent year - on - year			0
the @entity47 campaign group says season tickets will increase by an average of 4.2 per cent on wednesday , the tenth above - inflation increase in a row			2
defence : transport minister @entity8 said the government is carrying out its most rail investment since the 19th century and that it is ' only right ' that the public should help fund this the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) says the overall average rise , including non-season tickets , will be 3.9 per cent , but with some non-season - ticket fares allowed to be increased by an unlimited amount , @entity61 said tickets could go up by 10 per cent			1
analysis by campaigners suggested that average train fares have soared by more than 26 per cent since the start of the recession – a lower figure than reported by the @entity41 , although it is still suggesting a rate almost three times faster than wages			1
some commuters are paying £ 5,000 a year just to get to work - and many will now be paying £ 1,000 extra than in 2008			1
the @entity76 says the @entity77 has the highest train fares in @entity79 , with some @entity77 tickets almost ten times the price of equivalent fares on the continent			1
rail bosses have been accused of ‘ spinning ’ the full extent of the rises and ‘ burying bad news ’ by insisting the average increase would be 3.9 per cent			2
expensive : average train fares have soared by more than 26 per cent since the start of the recession - almost three times faster than wages so - called ‘ unregulated fares ’ , which include some off - peak trips , can be raised to any figure train companies choose			1
many of these will far exceed the 3.9 per cent ‘ average ’ rise – with some soaring nearly 10 per cent			0
@entity47 spokesman @entity98 said : ‘ yet again , rail fares go up with no perceptible improvement in service			2
‘ over the last ten years , fares have increased by more than 50 per cent – much more than people ’s incomes			1
‘ meanwhile , petrol tax is frozen and overall the cost of driving remains static			0
how does this help persuade people out of their cars and ease congestion ? where is the green policy ? ’ train passengers have endured widespread disruption , cancellations and delays over @entity118 and @entity119 – as well as pleas by rail bosses not to travel unless absolutely necessary – caused by a combination of flooding , weather and engineering works			0
and damning government figures published this month named and shamed the most crammed ‘ cattle - class ’ services			0
bad service : train passengers have had to put up with widespread disruption , cancellations and delays ( file picture ) new ‘ real time ’ punctuality figures have also shown that the worst - performing train companies are running fewer than half their services on time			0
this year regulated fares , which include season tickets , can be increased by the retail price index ( @entity142 ) inflation rate in july plus one percentage point			0
this gives the average figure of 4.2 per cent			0
mr @entity98 said : ‘ annual increases should be limited to no more than the rate of inflation , and that should be the consumer price index ( @entity152 ) not @entity142 , because that ’s the lower figure and pensions benefits and salaries are all linked to @entity152			0
’ from wednesday , fares are also going up by an average of 4.2 per cent on the @entity158 and buses			0
mayor @entity160 said : ‘ investment on the transport network will help us to provide faster , more frequent and reliable journeys for @entity165 and is crucial to economic development and growth			2

fares up by a *whopping* 40 *%* over past five years since recession started
some pay £ 5,000 to go to work and @entity77 has highest ticket prices in @entity79
transport minister : the increase is only right to fund the huge investment
