@entity9 , 48 , is demanding @entity6 bosses fund more surgery to remove the excess skin from her stomach , arms and legs after she shrunk from 35 stone to 13st 11lb following a sleeve gastrectomy			1
she said : ' in the summer , it ’s a nightmare			0
the skin rubs and leaves rashes all over my stomach			0
@entity9 , pictured before her dramatic weight loss , was told she was dangerously over weight and her organs were at risk of failing on her wedding day ( l ) @entity9 weighed almost 30 stone , today ( r ) she weighs an incredible 13 stone 11lb ' i still get comments in the street about my appearance , which is something i was hoping would stop after i lost weight			1
' @entity9 , who had her operation in july 2011 , is being supported by husband @entity35 , 48 , who also had an @entity6 operation in june 2012 to lose 11 stone			1
@entity9 said : ' the @entity6 keep moving the goalposts			1
they say my body mass index number needs to be below 25 to approve the funding , but my @entity42 is steady at 29			1
' considering that my @entity42 used to be nearly 80 , you would think there would be room for flexibility			2
' @entity9 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , hopes to be classed as an exceptional case and plans to persuade decision - makers at the @entity51 to sit down with her for a face - to - face meeting			1
@entity9 , pictured this year , now has a @entity42 of 29 , but the @entity6 say it must be below 25 for her to be considered for skin removal surgery ' i need several operations , including an apronectomy to remove the skin on my stomach			1
my gp has told me that to pay for everything myself would cost between £ 25,000 and £ 35,000			0
' there ’s no way we can afford that			0
' if only they could see me , to see the state i ’m in , they would feel differently about the situation			0
' @entity9 ’s weight steadily rose since childhood when she began comfort - eating to combat loneliness and anxiety			1
in her teenage years she became a heavy drinker			0
by the time she was in her mid- 30s , her weight had ballooned dangerously to 35 stone			0
she attempted to shed the weight through dieting and exercise , but when she married @entity35 in june 2007 , she still weighed 28 stone			2
by 2010 , @entity9 was effectively housebound and a visiting gp told her she needed to lose weight urgently			2
@entity9 and @entity35 on their wedding day , ( left ) when @entity35 weighed 25 stone and @entity9 weighed nearly 30 stone			1
between them the couple have now shed over 30 stone ( right ) @entity9 said : ' the doctor told me that unless something changed , my organs would start to fail			2
' he referred me to the @entity6 , but after the application i was told i needed to go to @entity96 hospital and make the case personally			1
' @entity35 said : ' me and @entity9 had to sit in front of a panel of six managers and basically beg them to approve the surgery			1
' @entity9 was in a wheelchair , and terrified because she was n’t used to being out of the house			2
it was a difficult experience for her - she felt quite humiliated			0
' @entity35 now a healthy 13st 7lb , is @entity9 's full time carer as years of obesity have left her with a series of health problems in july 2011 , surgeons carried out @entity9 ’s sleeve gastrectomy surgery			1
over the next year , through a baby food diet and an incremental exercise regime , she lost a staggering 15 stone			0
@entity9 said : ' all i could manage at first was pacing in the hallway , but eventually i could start walking outside and riding my bike			2
' the weight came off really quickly at first before stabilising at my current weight			0
i feel like a completely new person			0
then , in june 2012 , @entity35 was approved for a gastric bypass after a doctor judged his obesity to be causing chronic back and leg pain			1
he went from 25 stone to 13st 7lb			2
between them , the couple have lost more than 30 stone			0
years of obesity have left @entity9 with a series of health problems and unable to work			2
@entity35 , who is diabetic , acts as her full - time carer			1
@entity35 said : ' we ’re able to do things together now like day trips which we could n’t do before			2
we ’ve been brought much closer together			0
' we just have one more hurdle to get over , and that ’s persuading the @entity6 to remove @entity9 ’s saggy skin			1
' it ’s difficult for me to see how much she ’s struggling with it			0
' @entity9 is currently waiting to see whether she will be classed as an exceptional case by the @entity51			1
@entity9 , pictured on her wedding day in 2007 , weighing nearly 30 stone , is arguing that the huge amount of weight she has lost means she should be considered as a special case for the surgery a spokesman for @entity151 said : ' to protect a patient ’s privacy , we wo n’t comment on the circumstances in this case			1
however , we do always have to make sure that taxpayers ’ money we spend is only used for health needs			0
' we have to have a way of assessing that , so we have a policy which looks at the @entity42 of the patient and whether they are severely limited in what they can do because of the condition			0
' if a patient is assessed as not having medical needs in this way , then their doctor can still argue on their behalf that they have other “ exceptional ” care needs			0
' this appeal is tested by the @entity51 , which funds any treatment , according to whether the patient is significantly different from others with a similar issue , and whether that patient would benefit significantly more than others			0

@entity9 lost over 21st , dropping from 35st to 13st 11lb after surgery
her husband @entity35 lost over 11st after also *undergoing* a gastric bypass
now campaigning for @entity9 to have her excess skin removed on the @entity6
her @entity42 is currently 29 - above the @entity42 of 25 required for @entity6 surgery
@entity9 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , hopes to be classed as an exceptional case
