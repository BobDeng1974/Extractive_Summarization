by @entity0 the brain differences between the young and the old , people with autism , and even female mice have been revealed in a series of beautiful rainbow images			1
the collection of pictures use a kaleidoscope of colours to highlight neurons , electrical connections between cells , and other brain activity , and will go on show for the first time in @entity17 , @entity18 later this month			1
the pictures were created using mri scans , microscopic images and electrical monitoring and are part of an exhibition called @entity25			1
colourful images show the activity in the human brain in a kaleidoscope of colours and will go on show for the first time in @entity17 , @entity18			1
this wiring the brain image shows shows detailed maps of brain wiring in a sleeping newborn baby ( left ) and an adult in their seventies ( right ) visualised using an mri scanner researchers from the @entity43 created the exhibition to show the beauty they encounter while studying neurological disorders , such as autism			1
the exhibition also highlights the advanced technologies used by scientists to image the brain and its cells in action			1
some of the pictures , including one titled @entity56 , look like impressionist artwork , but instead show neurons in the brain of a female mouse			2
during the course of their research , the scientists who created the images found that autism and intellectual disability - linked to the x chromosome - are more prevalent in men than women			1
the pictures are created from mri scans , microscopic images and electrical monitoring , and are part of an exhibition called @entity25			1
this image , called the breakdown in communication , shows differences between a typical brain ( left ) and autism ( right ) researchers from the @entity43 have created the exhibition to show the beauty that they come across while studying neurological disorders such as autism			1
the @entity85 is pictured , which shows the complex electrical connections between brain cells males have one x and one y chromosome , while females have two x chromosomes - one inherited from each parent			1
to compensate for this second x , each cell in a female body randomly ‘ turns off ’ one x chromosome			0
the picture shows that neurons in the mouse ’s brain have turned off the x chromosome inherited from the mother ( in green ) and those that have silenced the @entity94 inherited from the father ( in red )			0
in another picture called @entity109 , the image created looks almost like a picture of deep space taken from the @entity112			2
an @entity114 's @entity113 shows that neurons talk to one another across a gap called the synaptic cleft , rather than being directly connected to one another			0
a trained eye can identify the wires this image , titled @entity122 , shows the difference in brain signals from a typical brain ( left ) and from a brain affected by a condition similar to @entity128 , which is the most common inherited form of autism the brain has two main cell types - neurons and glia			2
glia - named from the @entity136 word for glue - were originally thought of as the support cells for neurons			0
but it is now known that they are essential for many brain functions			0
the image in the collection shows two main types of glia from a human brain - astrocytes ( in green ) and a white oligodendrocyte			2
researchers from the university ’s @entity150 collaborated with the @entity153 charity @entity152 , to create the exhibition			2
‘ the human brain has more cells than there are stars in the @entity161 and these cells communicate through a thousand times as many connections , ’ said @entity155 , a fellow at the centre			0
this image , titled @entity56 , shows neurons in the brain of a female mouse			0
it reveals the neurons that have switched off the x chromosome inherited from the mother ( in green ) , and those that have silenced the x chromosome inherited from the father ( in red ) ‘ our goal is to understand how even small changes in these connections can have such detrimental effects on learning and memory			0
’ @entity185 , founder of @entity152 , added : ‘ these images are simply too beautiful to be hidden away in a lab. ‘ they were created to further our understanding of the brain but they can also be viewed as stunning examples of abstract art. ' our hope is that people admiring the pictures on show will also come away with a greater awareness of what it means to be affected by learning difficulties and other brain conditions			1
’ this image might look like one taken by the @entity112 of deep space , but @entity205 shows the two main types of glia from a human brain - astrocytes ( in green ) and a white oligodendrocyte			0
they also look a little bit like a spider 's web , only this web measures just 1/20 of a millimetre			0
glia - named from the @entity136 word for glue - were originally thought of as the support cells for neurons			0
but it is now known they are essential for many brain functions			0

colourful images of brain activity will go on show for the first time in @entity17 in @entity18 this month
the pictures *consist* of mri scans , microscopic images and electrical monitoring results
researchers from @entity18 created the exhibition to show the beauty of neurological disorders such as autism
exhibition also highlights the advanced technologies used by scientists to image the brain and its cells in action
