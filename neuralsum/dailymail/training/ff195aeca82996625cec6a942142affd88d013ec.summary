by @entity0 published : 20:36 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 15 march 2013 media pressure group hacked off made extraordinary threats against @entity4 in a bid to ‘ sabotage ’ cross-party talks on press reform , it emerged last night			1
the group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking would condemn @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‘ dirty deal ’			1
the statement even suggested that @entity19 ’s plans would make the @entity20 complicit in a ‘ stitch - up ’			1
the hacked off campaign attempted to blackmail labour leader @entity13 while he was in talks about press regulation the revelations came as the @entity27 parties published rival plans for @entity30 reform , which @entity31 will now vote on in a showdown in the @entity33 on monday night			1
all three main parties will order their mps to fall into line on monday			2
but @entity4 sources said they were in talks with a group of about 20 @entity41 rebels who may be persuaded to defy mr @entity19			2
a small group of @entity31 could also rebel , but most @entity45 observers believe the @entity47 arithmetic is narrowly against the prime minister at this stage			2
a draft press release was shown to senior @entity4 figures on tuesday – just 24 hours after the three party leaders had been on the verge of a deal on bringing in a tough new system of press regulation by @entity57			2
@entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) are both involved in the hacked off campaign sources close to the talks said mr @entity13 then tabled 20 new demands the following day , making a deal ‘ unworkable ’			1
a @entity41 source said : ‘ it sabotaged the talks – it became impossible , because @entity4 were taking dictation from @entity68			0
@entity13 came back with 20 further demands which were not there and which scuppered the whole thing			1
they have no principled position on this			0
’ @entity68 ’s draft press release included a statement signed by the parents of @entity79 , the parents of @entity81 , @entity58 and a number of other phone hacking victims , in which they accused the @entity4 and @entity86 leadership of doing a ‘ dirty deal ’			1
hacked off initially denied threatening @entity4 with a draft press release when it was put to them by the @entity90 on thursday night			2
@entity91 and @entity92 , the parents of missing school girl @entity94 who had her mobile phone hacked murdered schoolgirl @entity79 , 13 , with her mother @entity97			0
when she went missing journalists hacked into @entity94 's phone but yesterday a spokesman acknowledged the existence of the statement and did not deny using it to pile pressure on @entity4			2
a spokesman said : ‘ this draft press release was written as a worst case scenario and was never formally sent to the media			0
we had to be prepared for every eventuality			0
’ @entity4 insisted it had not changed its position as a result of the intense lobbying by @entity68			0
a source said the fresh demands tabled by mr @entity13 had already been raised ‘ many times ’ with officials			1
monday ’s vote will be a critical moment in the history of press freedom – with critics warning @entity125 ’s tradition of free speech is at risk			0
dragons ’ den star @entity128 told @entity130 : ‘ the last thing we want is for politicians to be able to control the @entity30			0
we need to have a free press			0
’ the @entity135 released proposals for a press regulator governed by @entity57 which would impose what the prime minister described as ‘ the toughest regulation of the @entity30 that this country has ever seen ’			0
@entity142 and @entity143 , giving evidence to @entity146 's media ethics inquiry , at the @entity147 in @entity148 an hour later , mr @entity13 and mr @entity15 published their own plans , which would also use a @entity57 to establish a regulator but would be underpinned by legislation – seen by critics as the thin end of the wedge in allowing politicians to interfere with the press			1
they would also remove control from editors of the newspaper code of practice			0
industry sources last night said the issue was a ‘ red line ’ which would see newspapers refuse to sign up to the deal			0
in other respects the proposals represent a climbdown by mr @entity13 , who initially backed @entity146 ’s call for media regulator @entity172 to oversee a new press regulator whose role would be ‘ set out in statute ’			1
the retreat will fuel suspicions that the @entity4 leader has been playing to the gallery by calling for the full implementation of @entity146 ’s plans in public , while privately conceding they were unworkable			0
a @entity41 source last night said the prime minister ’s decision to pull the plug on cross party talks had ‘ flushed out ’ mr @entity13			1
mr @entity15 said he was still hopeful a last - minute deal could be reached .			1

the group threatened to release a statement condemning @entity13
they also mention @entity15 and @entity14 in the *letter*
