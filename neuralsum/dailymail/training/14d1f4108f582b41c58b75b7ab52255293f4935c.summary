by @entity1 reporter published : 19:53 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 17 may 2013 under strain : @entity4 's obesity epidemic is forcing dentist 's to buy new chairs capable of supporting to people up to 71 stone @entity4 's obesity crisis is forcing dentists to buy supersized chairs capable of supporting patients weighing up to 71 stone			1
the £ 25,000 recliners are four times the price of standard seats			2
they are designed for overweight and clinically obese patients , but are likely to become standard issue as more people come into those categories			1
a study published in the @entity22 said the cost implications of replacing equipment to cope with overweight patients would have a ‘ very serious ’ impact on @entity27 resources			1
@entity27 surgeries can not turn patients away for being too heavy to be operated on safely			1
@entity30 , of the @entity31 , said the development ‘ does n’t surprise me ’			0
he added : ‘ it comes after wider seats in planes and bigger operating tables , hospital beds , ambulances , wheelchairs , you name it			0
‘ with almost all new seats that are being made now for public places people are having to think about new widths because , with three - quarters of the adult population overweight , girths are bigger			1
‘ the obesity problem is going to go on for at least another generation so these chairs are going to be necessary			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity51 said : ‘ we are aware that the rise in the prevalence of obesity within the @entity4 population is an issue that will affect general dental practice in the near future			2
’ the study warned : ‘ sadly , the speed of the obesity epidemic has been greater than the recognition of the impending crisis by healthcare services			2
many hospitals in developed countries are now recognising the need for bariatric equipment such as beds , hoists , wheelchairs and commodes to take patients weighing in excess of 350kg ( 55st )			2
warning : a study has suggested that the cost implications of overweight patients could have a ' very serious ' impact on @entity27 reseources ‘ the cost implications for such re-equipping alone will have a very serious impact on resources , as will the increased width of bariatric beds , reducing the bed capacity of some hospital wards by half			1
’ at one dental surgery in the @entity92 a sign has been put up warning patients that the chairs carry a maximum weight of 35st			0
other @entity27 dentists have bought the @entity98 bariatric recliner , which can accommodate patients up to 71 stone			1
it would have only just coped with @entity102 , of @entity103 , who weighed 70st and was the world ’s fattest man before a gastric bypass helped him slim dramatically			0
in the past two years around 60 @entity98 recliners have been sold and demand is increasing			0
@entity109 , of @entity4 supplier @entity110 , said the tide of obesity meant the seats were likely to become commonplace			0
he added : ‘ the @entity114 has a safe working load of 71 stone			0
dental chairs at the moment have a safe working load of around 22 stone to 25 stone but they do n’t really work at those weights once a patient is sat back			0
‘ it ’s something the @entity27 is very aware of and obesity is now classed under the @entity125 , which means everyone has the right to access services			1
’ obesity rates have more than doubled over the past 25 years in the @entity4			0
the costs to the @entity27 as a whole are projected to double to £ 10billion per year by 2050 .			1
