lieutenant @entity0 , who was captured earlier this month			1
in the aftermath heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern @entity4 town of @entity5 the @entity7 military has been criticised over using the so - called ' @entity9 ' tactic to stop the capture of soldiers , which has killed over 100 @entity13			1
the army has used the procedure , which allows overwhelming fire after soldiers when it is feared militants have captured an officer			1
it was allegedly used recently when heavy shelling was unleashed on the southern @entity4 town of @entity5 after the capture of lieutenant @entity0 earlier this month			1
now , a group is calling on the military to abandon the practice , saying it puts captured soldiers at unreasonable risk and can lead to civilian deaths			2
the @entity28 , a prominent rights group , has asked the government to strike down the doctrine and investigate its use			1
in a letter to @entity7 's attorney general they wrote : ' a protocol that puts the life of the captured soldier in jeopardy to thwart a kidnapping is fundamentally unacceptable			2
' implementing this protocol in populated areas , wherein the soldier and his captors are surrounded by a civilian population that is not taking part in hostilities , is strictly prohibited			0
' @entity7 's @entity48 declined to comment , merely saying it received the letter			0
new recruits to the @entity7 army learn that if they see a soldier being captured and rushed away in a car , they should shoot at the vehicle to stop its progress , even if it risks the soldier 's life			2
the ' @entity58 ' was designed in the mid- 1980s by @entity59 , then head of @entity7 's @entity61 , after @entity63 guerrillas captured two soldiers in southern @entity65			1
however , its use in the recent conflict has angered critics who say it may have led to the deaths of scores of @entity13 earlier this month , when @entity7 soldiers feared militants had captured lieutenant @entity0			1
@entity76 fire killed @entity0 and two other @entity7 soldiers near @entity5 , along @entity4 's southern border with @entity79 , shortly after an internationally brokered cease - fire took effect			1
according to @entity7 media reports , three bodies were found at the scene shortly after the ambush , but upon closer inspection troops realized that one of them was a @entity76 militant disguised in an @entity7 uniform â€” raising fears that @entity76 had captured @entity0			2
defying protocol , a fellow officer rushed into one of the tunnels and found some personal effects belonging to @entity0 that helped the military later rule him dead			2
the @entity7 military would not officially confirm whether the tactic was enacted after @entity0 's disappearance , but multiple officials say the rare order was given			2
the heavy shelling levelled the area in @entity5 , killing some 100 palestinians , @entity13 health officials say			1
a 72 - hour ceasefire between @entity7 and @entity76 is set to end at midnight tonight local time a @entity13 boy holds bomb remnants and a bullet belt during the temporary ceasefire in @entity4 @entity124 , a philosophy professor who authored the military 's official code of conduct in the 1990s , said the ' @entity58 ' has been grossly misunderstood and strikes a delicate balance between protecting the lives of soldiers and carrying out military responsibilities			1
much of the directive remains classified , but @entity124 stressed the conventional wisdom of a ' dead soldier being better than a captive soldier ' was a fallacy			0
' that is just an awful saying and totally untrue			0
it goes against every value of the @entity7 military ' , he said			0
however , @entity143 , an @entity28 lawyer , said the practice violates the potential captive 's human rights			0
when employed in a crowded area like @entity4 , it raised even more questions			0
since the latest truce went into effect on sunday , @entity7 has halted military operations in the coastal territory and @entity4 militants have stopped firing rockets she said : ' a command that subjugates the life of a soldier to an unknown political gain ... is both cynical and revolting			0
' activating this protocol in the heart of an urban and civilian environment is particularly grave ; it shakes the foundations of law and morality and must be absolutely condemned			0
' it comes as 72 - hour truce between @entity7 and @entity76 is set to expire at midnight local time with negotiators in @entity172 trying to thrash out a more permanent ceasefire arrangement			0
since the latest truce went into effect on monday , @entity7 has halted military operations in the coastal territory and @entity4 militants have stopped firing rockets .			0
