@entity0 has bought a four - storey , £ 3.6million @entity2 townhouse in central @entity3 to share with his new wife			1
the property , in @entity6 , has a master bedroom with en - suite bathroom , two further bathrooms and two reception rooms			2
the 29 - year - old , who is though to be preparing a bid to become an mp , completed the purchase just days before he married @entity16 graduate @entity15 last month			1
love nest : the new mr and mrs @entity19 ( left ) will be moving into their new £ 3.6million @entity2 townhouse ( right ) soon having put the old house on the market for £ 1million more than tony and @entity24 paid two years ago situated in @entity3 the impressive property has easy access to @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity0 dated @entity30 for eight years before the pair finally got married in the @entity32 , the £ 5.75 million grade i - listed mansion in the @entity34 countryside owned by @entity35 and @entity24			1
@entity0 is also thought to be making a move into politics by running as the @entity39 candidate for safe seat of @entity41 at the next election , after @entity43 said he was stepping down			1
the couple are yet to move into their new home and are living in a slightly less lavish house about a mile away			2
the four - storey house bought for £ 1.29million has been put on the market for £ 2.35million – leaving the @entity50 with a potential £ 1million profit in just three years			1
on the market : the @entity53 property has an asking price of £ 2.35million there ’s one snag , however			1
the house is being marketed as containing a ‘ separate apartment ’ , even though planning permission has never been obtained for one			2
the @entity53 home was bought in the name of @entity0 , 29 , and his mother @entity24 in 2010			1
it immediately attracted controversy because of an attempt to get planning permission to separate the basement into a self - contained flat			2
@entity68 received an application to build steps down to the basement from the street , and to divide it into a separate flat			0
the internal stairs to the basement were to be removed			0
three neighbours complained , fearing greater pressure on parking , rubbish collection and other services , and after advice from the council the application was amended			0
this application retained the new external entrance – and its own kitchen – and was duly approved			0
however , a council officer noted in june 2010 : ‘ this permission does not authorise the use of the basement as a separate self - contained flat			2
’ by may 2011 , the council received a complaint that @entity0 had replaced a door to the upper floors with a wall , in an apparent attempt to create a separate basement flat			1
following ‘ enforcement action ’ the council was told the wall was being replaced by a door			0
but last year , the battle to create a separate flat resumed and , at one stage , a new number was placed on the basement door , along with a letter box			0
the council again took ‘ enforcement action ’ saying that it received a report of ‘ general nuisance ( loss of amenity ) ’ , involving the ‘ use of the basement as a self - contained flat ’			0
visits from the council led to a denial from @entity0 that he was using his basement as a separate flat , and the action ceased			1
but the property is now being marketed by @entity120 estate agents as having ‘ a separate apartment on the lower ground floor ’ ideal for a ‘ separate office or rental investment ’			0
there is no warning it still needs planning permission			0
last night sources at the estate agents claimed that the one - bedroom flat had been rented out for £ 1,200 a month			1
the source said a locked door on the stairs to the upper floors ensured the basement could be used as a separate home			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity50 refused to explain why both the house advert and estate agent suggested the basement was a self - contained home – but insisted @entity0 and @entity24 had done nothing wrong			1
‘ @entity68 has already accepted that there are two units , which is why it charges two separate council taxes , ’ the spokesman added			0
a spokesman for @entity68 said : ‘ no planning application has been received to divide this house into two dwellings – and following information received we have now started an investigation			0
’ another council spokesman said council tax valuations had no bearing on whether planning permission had been issued for the basement flat to be a separate dwelling			0
last month @entity0 married girlfriend @entity15 , 25 .			2
