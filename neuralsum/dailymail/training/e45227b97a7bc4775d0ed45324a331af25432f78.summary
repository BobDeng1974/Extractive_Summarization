half of @entity2 have experienced feelings of depression , a new study shows half of us say we have felt the despair of depression – twice as many as official statistics suggest			1
a survey by a leading charity found that almost one in two @entity2 report having experienced feelings of depression			1
the usual estimate given is one in four			0
the poll , by the @entity15 , asked thousands of adults whether they had ever experienced depression , and 45 per cent said yes			1
almost nine out of ten of these also said they had suffered loneliness as a result of depression , with many struggling to find others to talk to about the condition			0
the survey comes amid a major push by the government to put mental wellbeing on the @entity30 map			1
officials have warned that some sufferers of mental illness have the same life expectancy as people living in the 1950s			1
many patients with mental health problems die early because of other physical conditions that are not managed well enough , including heart disease and cancer			1
patients with schizophrenia will , on average , die 14.6 years earlier than the general population , while those with bipolar disorder generally die 10.1 years earlier			0
yet some of the 40,000 deaths among people with serious mental illness each year could be cut if they received the same healthcare checks as the general population , according to @entity51			1

but 86 per cent of those who had been depressed said they were often lonely and unable to share their experiences with others			0
@entity110 , the charity ’s chief executive , said : ‘ this survey clearly demonstrates that to maintain recovery from depression people need to have access to other people with the condition			0
the loneliness and isolation that come with depression can have a devastating impact on people from all walks of life			0
‘ this can be a particular problem for men who often do not have the same social support networks that women have			0
