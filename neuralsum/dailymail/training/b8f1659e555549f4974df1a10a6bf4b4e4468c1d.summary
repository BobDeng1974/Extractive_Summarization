by @entity0 the boss of energy giant @entity2 will keep his £ 500,000 annual bonus despite the firm receiving a record fine for mis - selling to hundreds of thousands of customers			1
the @entity8 - owned company faces a bill of up to £ 21million after industry regulator @entity10 discovered ‘ large scale mis - selling ’ over three years			1
some 465,000 customers lost out after they switched to the supplier based on false promises by aggressive salesmen about how much they could save			1
penalty : @entity2 has been made to pay a record £ 12million to elderly and disabled customers after it mis - sold energy deals for more than three years			1
the fine was a nominal £ 1 so that funds did not go to the @entity22 yesterday , the firm was fined a record £ 12million and told to pay compensation			1
but in what one mp has called an ‘ extraordinary ’ twist , @entity27 chief executive dr @entity26 refused to resign – and will only see his annual bonus cut by a quarter			0
despite the scandal , the company said last night he will still receive a bonus of £ 510,232 , giving him a total pay package worth almost £ 950,000 for last year			1
he has been chief executive since 2011			0
critics branded the decision ‘ unjustifiable and indefensible ’			0
those who could be in line for a payout will be contacted in two groups			0
the first group , 333,000 people receiving the @entity43 , will automatically be given £ 35 each			2
these are mostly pensioners and the disabled			2
the second group is 465,000 people to whom deals may have been mis - sold , and will also include some people on the @entity43			1
they will be sent a letter by @entity2 in the near future outlining how to work out whether they are affected and how to claim			2
anyone with concerns , even if they were not in these two groups , should ring the dedicated hotline on 0800 0568497			0
the revelation that dr @entity26 will keep his bonus is particularly surprising because @entity10 singled out management for criticism			2
in its report , it said bosses ‘ did not do enough to identify issues or act when problems were discovered ’			0
despite this , none of @entity2 ’s @entity27 board directors have lost their jobs , the company confirmed			2
it has also emerged that @entity2 ’s mis - selling took place during a period when it was telling customers it had overhauled its sales practices			1
in january 2012 , the company embarked on a six month ‘ reset ’ programme to improve its relationship with customers			0
but the process failed to stop widespread mis - selling across the group			1
now @entity2 will have to pay up to £ 8million to 333,000 elderly and vulnerable customers			1
this is the equivalent of around £ 35 each			0
the overall bill includes the cost of administering the compensation scheme			0
the energy giant will also write to all of the customers who could have been mis - sold to , which totals 465,000			1
the first letters are expected to arrive on monday and these eligible customers are set to receive around £ 67 per household			2
anyone who signed up to @entity2 between june 2010 and december 2013 could be entitled to compensation			1
@entity2 said bonuses for directors involved in overseeing the sales were cut by up to 50 per cent			1
@entity99 - sold : it is thought tens of thousands of customers were affected by the practices ( file photo ) @entity2 chief executive @entity26 : ' it is unacceptable that we may have been unclear with customers ' it added that dr @entity26 ’s bonus has been reduced by 26 per cent , from £ 687,200 in 2012			1
it is understood some of the staff involved in mis - selling have left the firm since but none are at board level			1
yesterday , dr @entity26 said that the mis - selling was ‘ completely unacceptable ’ and insisted there was ‘ no organised attempt to mislead ’			1
but he refused to resign			0
he added : ‘ we are really sorry and want to make it absolutely clear that we are putting this right			0
’ five of @entity27 ’s largest power suppliers – @entity2 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 – have been fined for mis - selling			1
only @entity127 has not been caught up in the scandal			0
@entity2 ’s fine is the largest of any of the suppliers			2
@entity132 , a @entity133 mp who sits on the energy select committee , said : ‘ it is extraordinary that they are still going to give him an enormous bonus			0
this is a reward for failure , but it is also more than that			0
it is symptomatic of a culture where people do not accept any responsibility for their actions			0
the people at the top of our energy companies are scratching each other ’s backs and the consumers pay the price for that			0
’ his @entity133 colleague on the committee , @entity160 , said : ‘ it just beggars belief that a company that has ripped people off and been found out doing it would give anyone a bonus			0
’ @entity168 energy minister @entity167 said : ‘ @entity2 ’s chief executive claims to have taken responsibility … but he will still be receiving 75 per cent of his bonus			2
‘ that will strike many as unjustifiable and indefensible			0
