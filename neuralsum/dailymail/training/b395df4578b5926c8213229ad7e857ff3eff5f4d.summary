by @entity1 reporter published : 11:52 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 13:11 est , 27 august 2013 @entity3 flop : @entity5 ' @entity4 was launched in @entity6 last august but it is being withdrawn after shoppers over the @entity8 failed to take to it @entity11 baker @entity5 has pulled out of the @entity6 bread market after its ' @entity4 ' loaf failed to compete with the baguette			1
last summer it started selling long life white , brown and seeded loaves - marketed as ' the everyday @entity19 bread ' - in more than 200 supermarkets across the @entity8			1
but @entity6 consumers would not be moved and stuck to their traditional habit of buying fresh every day			1
@entity5 admitted today it had quit the @entity6 market because @entity4 , which had a ten - day shelf life , proved uneconomical			1
a @entity5 spokeswoman told @entity28 magazine : ' it was not cost effective to continue to produce and distribute the extended shelf life range solely for @entity6			2
' in @entity6 where most people buy freshly baked baguettes every day , sliced bread has more preservatives and lasts longer before going stale because it is typically bought irregularly for use in emergencies			1
the decision follows @entity5 ’ exit from @entity40 at the end of last year			2
its bread products were listed in @entity45 stores in the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 for a year , but the baker pulled out because of high transport costs and a lack of suitable manufacturing partners in the region			0
as part of its export push , @entity5 also developed a frozen range that is selling successfully to expats in @entity59 and elsewhere			0
faced with a drop in bread sales in the @entity11 , the family owned baker has diversified its range of products			0
could n't kick the habit : the @entity6 love for the baguette and other fresh breads meant the long life @entity71 failed to make an impact this year it has grown its ‘ free - from ’ range under the @entity76 sub-brand , relaunched its snacks range under the @entity79 name and acquired speciality bread maker @entity80			1
@entity5 was founded by @entity81 in 1876 and is based in @entity82 , @entity83			0
for much of its history @entity5 only had bakeries in @entity86 and it remains a family - owned company			0
the company embarked on a large expansion program in the late 1990s which continued in the 2000s and it has grown across the @entity11 after being relatively unheard of outside the @entity82 and @entity83 area			0
the firm has a 24 per cent share of the @entity11 bread market and the @entity5 brand is the most popular bread in the @entity11 , ahead of rivals @entity99 and @entity100 , a position it has held since 2008			2
overall , @entity5 products are the second - best selling food and drink brand in the @entity11 after @entity105 and ahead of other big @entity11 brands such as @entity107 and @entity108 .			0

' @entity4 ' launched across @entity8 last august but has now been axed
the @entity6 stuck to habit and continued to buy fresh bread every day
@entity5 also *abandoned* *attempts* to sell its loaves in @entity40
