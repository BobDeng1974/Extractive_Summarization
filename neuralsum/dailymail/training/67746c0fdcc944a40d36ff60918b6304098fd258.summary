@entity2 , now 52 , enjoyed doing ' outrageous ' things to provoke his adoptive parents , @entity9 and june , both 61 , before he went on to shoot them dead at their @entity12 farmhouse alongside his adopted sister @entity13 and her six - year - old twins			1
farm secretary @entity15 , who worked at the @entity17 ' farm before and after the august 1985 murders , told a new investigation : ' he 'd wear lipstick , eye shadow , and paint his eyelashes and put on make - up			1
' @entity9 and @entity24 , both 61 , were shot dead by their adopted son @entity25 , right - @entity9 foresaw his death farm secretary @entity15 says @entity2 would wear full make - up to provoke his father , @entity9 @entity30 , @entity2 's adoptive sister , and her twin sons @entity33 and @entity34 , six , were killed ' he used to do outrageous things that used to upset mr @entity2			1
he was a @entity36 character			0
' mrs @entity15 said the the atmosphere at the @entity17 ' @entity38 in @entity39 changed dramatically a few months before the killings			1
it was alleged that @entity2 had stumbled across his parents ' wills and was outraged to discover he was to share their wealth equally with his adopted sister , @entity13			1
despite being set to receive around £ 400,000 , worth around £ 1million today , it was said that he decided to kill @entity13 and anyone else who might have a claim to the money to ensure he got it all			0
on the night of 7 august 1985 , 25 rounds were shot at the farmhouse , leaving @entity53 and june , @entity13 , and her sons @entity33 and @entity55 , dead			1
the small boys had been shot in the head			0
the @entity17 ' farm secretary said there was ' a lot of bickering ' in the run - up to the murders , and said the elder mr @entity2 , who looked tired and worried , told her he feared something appalling was going to happen			1
mrs @entity15 said : ' for some weeks he looked really drawn and ill. he seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders			1
killing scene : @entity38 , at @entity39 , where the mass murder took place in august 1986 ' i thought he might have cancer ... he said he had n't got anything like that but he had got great problems			0
' i asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die			0
i said " what makes you think that ? " and he said there might be a serious shooting accident			0
' ' knowing what had been going on , [ @entity84 ] thought that he knew that @entity25 was going to perhaps shoot him			0
' @entity2 was said to envy his sister , nicknamed @entity86 , and the attention she and her two sons got from @entity2 , a former @entity90 pilot , and his wife			2
police initially accepted @entity2 's version that his sister had had a psychotic episode and shot her whole family dead before shooting herself , and was seen sobbing at his family 's funerals			2
he said he was alerted to the tragedy when his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that @entity13 had gone mad , before the phone went dead			2
but detectives became suspicious of his behaviour , and when @entity2 's then girlfriend @entity105 told police he 'd confessed to her , they pieced together the truth			0
@entity2 , now 52 , has always maintained his model sister @entity13 , right , killed her family in a psychotic episode prosecutors said @entity2 's theory was impossible because a silencer was found hidden in a cupboard with @entity13 's blood on it , and he was was found guilty on a 10 - 2 majority verdict			1
the prosecution said he shot his family dead , leaving the gun and an open @entity121 beside his sister to make it look as if she killed herself last , before climbing out of a window and cycling three miles home to the cottage his father had given him			2
@entity2 was sentenced to life in prison at the @entity128 in 1986			2
in a tv interview for tomorrow 's documentary , countdown to murder , mrs @entity15 said that @entity2 tried to provoke his mother , june , by riding his bike round and round her in circles , trying to knock her with the bicycle			1
on another occasion , he left a bag of live rats in his mother 's car			0
mrs @entity15 added : ' @entity25 would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty ... @entity2 , seen here with his then girlfriend @entity145 at one of the funerals after the slaughter she said that when @entity2 took over his father 's farm after the murders , she never once saw him grieving for his family			1
' i wanted to shout out to him " i know what you 've done " but i did n't have the guts to do it ...			0
' i think i might have ended up the same way as @entity2 and mrs @entity24			2
' in court it was argued that without a silencer , the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger			0
and if the silencer had been attached to the gun , it would have been too long for @entity13 to have shot herself with it			2
the prosecution argued that @entity2 had no interest in inheriting his father 's business , but wanted the £ 436,000 family fortune			0
when @entity2 offered his son a job on the farm in 1986 , it was the catalyst for the younger man , who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away , to plan a way to get the money for himself			1
@entity2 , one of only 38 prisoners in @entity183 and @entity184 serving a whole - life sentence , has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in september 1986			1
however despite several appeals and reviews , and despite former @entity191 mp @entity190 saying last month that he believed @entity2 was innocent , the mass murderer remains in jail			0
