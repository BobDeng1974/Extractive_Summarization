police declared both deaths solved and that pharmaceutical millionaire @entity20 was not involved in either			2
tragedy : @entity8 's death was the first in a bizarre series of events that led to his father 's girlfriend being found hanged , bound and naked , from a balcony at the palatial home in @entity17 two days later @entity8 was in the care of his father 's girlfriend @entity30 at the time of his death			1
@entity8 's death was ruled an accident and miss @entity30 's death deemed a suicide			1
@entity8 's mother @entity37 - who divorced from @entity8 's father in 2010 - refused to believe these findings and instead hired her own team of investigators			1
the new report claimed that @entity8 was the victim of a homicide			1
@entity20 and @entity37 were said to have had a tumultuous and sometimes violent relationship and they repeatedly accused each other of verbal and physical abuse in the short time they were married			2
police had to be called to the 27 - room mansion on three different occasions			2
ms @entity37 called on the @entity53 police to reopen the case after the findings from dr @entity56 , a @entity58 - based forensic pathologist , and dr @entity59 , an injury biomechanics expert			2
search for answers : @entity37 hired a new team of investigators who cast doubt on the original autopsy report that her son @entity8 's death was an accident she told @entity70 : ' i ca n't imagine anyone in the world wanting to harm @entity74			1
he was the most sweet , loving and gentle boy			2
' in the new report , both medical experts said that @entity8 had injuries consistent with being beaten			1
dr @entity56 reported that the child had injuries on his body which could not just have come from a fall , adding that it was impossible for @entity8 to have bumped into the balcony and fallen over			1
the claims appeared to point the finger at @entity20 's girlfriend @entity88 which the late woman 's sister strongly denied today			2
mystery : @entity8 's multimillionaire father , @entity20 , was not home at the time , but mr @entity8 's girlfriend , miss @entity30 , 32 , was along with her 13 - year - old sister @entity97 told @entity98 : ' the thought that @entity88 would cause @entity8 harm is preposterous			1
' @entity97 added that the relationship between her sister and @entity8 was a close and loving one , with her treating him like her own child			1
the @entity53 police department said it would review the report and decide whether to reopen the investigation			2
@entity8 died at the hospital shortly after he tumbled down the grand staircase at the historic @entity111 manor			1

@entity20 founded pharmaceutical giant @entity119 and has been chairman and chief executive since 1988			0
the company makes dermatological and aesthetic pharmaceutical products and took $ 700million in revenue last year			0
@entity8 has two other children from a previous marriage to @entity128 , a pharmaceuticals sales representative for rival firm @entity130			1
the couple married in april 1993 in @entity132 , @entity114 , before filing for divorce in 1999			0
she later told a psychologist that on their honeymoon he asked her if she thought the marriage was a mistake			0
@entity139 records show the couple reached a joint - custody agreement in 2001 for two children : a 14 - year - old girl and a 13 - year - old boy			0
@entity8 later married @entity145 , @entity8 's mother , and the couple divorced in 2008			1
miss @entity30 , from @entity147 , had been dating the multimillionaire for two years and friends said he had been planning on proposing to her			0
miss @entity150 began working as an ophthalmic technician in april 2008 , but left in december 2010 to devote more time to mr @entity8 and his three children			1
two days after @entity8 's death on july 16 , mr @entity8 discovered miss @entity30 hanging dead from an outside balcony			1
she was naked , gagged and her hands and feet bound			0
miss @entity30 's parents also believe that their daughter was murdered			0
they hired a private pathologist to conduct a second autopsy			0
that expert said his findings cast doubt on the suicide ruling			0
however , @entity165 @entity164 said the second look revealed no new information and the case remains closed			0
her sister said she spoke with her sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life			2
she said she planned to bring mr @entity8 breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the hospital where his son was being treated			1
dr @entity180 , a private consultant in high - profile investigations ranging from the @entity183 assassination to the death of @entity185 , made a nationally televised appearance today on the @entity188 show to render his opinion about the bizarre death of @entity30			0
dr @entity180 performed a second , independent autopsy on miss @entity30 's body last month at the request of relatives who have challenged the official determination of the @entity165 and coroner that she took her own life			2
he agreed with the official autopsy finding that the cause of miss @entity30 's death was asphyxiation by hanging , but said he strongly doubted she killed herself			0
' while i am not prepared to unequivocally , with absolute scientific certainty , say that it was a homicide and that it was not a suicide , i lean very strongly toward it being a homicide , something involving foul play			0
and i lean very strongly against it being a suicide , ' he said			0
dr @entity180 said he was particularly troubled by findings in both autopsies that miss @entity30 had suffered blows to the top of her head , indicated by four separate hemorrhages beneath the scalp			0
he said such an injury pointed to the possibility that she was knocked unconscious with a blunt object and could explain why police said there was no sign of a struggle at the scene			0
dr @entity180 said he was also puzzled as to why miss @entity30 's neck was not broken by the force of her fall from the balcony			0
he said the way in which miss @entity30 would have had to tie herself up was possible , but implausible .			0

@entity8 found on first floor of the palatial home in @entity17
independent medical report said child had injuries ' from being beaten '
