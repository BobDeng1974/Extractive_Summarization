my kitchen confidantes : @entity24 and @entity23			1
’ as a result , the impending cases , according to a source , have created a deep rift between the celebrity chef and her husband			2
‘ the @entity23 girls had been very close to @entity1 for a long time , ’ the source says			1
‘ she brought them into the marriage and she has naturally been very defensive about all this			2
i do n’t think she particularly wanted them to be sued			0

‘ the pair are devout @entity168 with previous good conduct with not a blemish on their record			2
‘ it was @entity24 who first started working for @entity1 as a personal assistant			2
the story , as i understand it , is that she actually worked for @entity1 when her first husband @entity55 was alive – so for longer than ten years			0
