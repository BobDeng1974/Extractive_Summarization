on saturday evening , when @entity1 walks out of his favourite club , he should settle for a quiet night in to watch @entity3			1
after @entity5 at home he should put his feet up to watch two of the best left wingers in world football play in the biggest fixture going			0
@entity10 versus @entity11 will be an education			1
after @entity1 ’s nocturnal visit to @entity15 ’s trendy @entity14 in @entity15 , just 24 hours after @entity17 ’s victory over @entity18 , the most important club in his career is @entity20			1
@entity10 is an established star at @entity21 , while @entity1 is @entity20 's emerging force @entity10 and @entity1 , the key men for their teams , shake hands before kick off at @entity26 @entity10 finishes off @entity28 's ball through brilliantly to give @entity21 the lead at @entity26 @entity1 bemoans what he percieved to be an early foul close to the edge of @entity21 's box the attitude of a superstar , a genuine world beater , is to put all that stuff off until he is finished with football in his mid-thirties			1
that ’s what @entity10 did when he committed his mind , body and soul to the sport when he arrived at @entity46 at the age of 17			1
look how it has paid off			0
on wednesday night , in the seductive colours of the ten time @entity51 champions @entity21 , @entity10 taught @entity1 how to play that role down the left			1
in short he was magnificent and was clapped off by the @entity20 fans when he was substituted			2
when @entity55 scored @entity21 ’s third , @entity1 stood hands on hips and wondered out loud how @entity20 could ever get a grip on this game			1
this is the world ’s best football team and it was a privilege to watch them take @entity20 apart in this @entity66 group game			1
when one cog in the wheel of the world ’s best football team is n’t functioning , they simply turn to another expensive piece of machinery to do the job			0
@entity1 tries to break his way past @entity75 but it was a frustrating first half for him @entity1 tries to give @entity77 a difficult time as he brings the ball forward in a @entity20 counter-attack @entity10 , @entity81 , @entity28 , @entity82 and @entity83 turned the screw at will			1
@entity20 ? they just feed @entity1			1
it is impossible to rely on him alone , to think that a kid of 19 can handle the responsibility and pressure of trying to win a game against one of the best club teams we have ever seen			0
to his credit , @entity92 is doing his best to shield him from the spotlight after a series of events that would affect even the most stable teenager			0
‘ it comes with his rise that people might want to knock him , but he is focused , ’ claimed @entity20 ’s manager			2
‘ for @entity1 , at 19 years of age and six days before a game , people are saying he ca n’t go out ? that ’s not right			2
’ at least @entity1 was willing , running his guts out down the left and trying to make up for losing possession by haring back down the touchline			2
there was admiration from @entity112 , the man who made the @entity66 happen last season on that dramatic night against @entity114 in @entity115			0
click here for our brilliant match zone , including all the players ' heat maps @entity1 's heat map shows he did most of his work down the left - hand side of the pitch and had an influence goals : 0 total shots : 1 shots on target : 1 passes made : 31 pass completion : 87.1 % chances created : 2 goals : 1 total shots : 6 shots on target : 4 passes made : 56 pass completion : 83.3 % chances created : 0 @entity10 's heatmap shows him all over the park at @entity26 , including his goalmouth clearance @entity10 guides his shot past @entity144 to give @entity21 the lead in the first half and then the @entity148 star celebrates in front of the @entity26 crowd after his first goal at the ground @entity153 next on @entity10 's hit - list ‘ the position of @entity1 and sometimes @entity157 was important , they tried to attack us and they were dangerous , ’ admitted @entity112			1
‘ after we scored the three goals they were a little bit down mentally and it was easier for us			0
’ the fact that @entity1 was probably @entity20 ’s most influential player on this wretched night for @entity92 and his teams says so much about his standing in this team			1
there will come a time when @entity1 controls the @entity20 tempo again , learning to juggle his responsibilities to club and country as he makes his way through the game			1
‘ @entity1 was playing in a position that was a little bit alien to him , ’ added @entity92			2
‘ he coped well and he did well			0
’ @entity1 must learn from the likes of @entity10 and co with the pressure on him now amplified there were shouts , legitimate ones , that he should have earned a free - kick when he drew a foul from @entity75 on the edge of the area after six minutes			1
the @entity187 were off their seats in expectation again midway through the first half when he somehow held on to the ball and made his way towards the byline			0
he made enough room to swing his left peg at it and get a decent enough cross over , but @entity20 were afraid to commit			2
you sensed that @entity21 would be rampant here and they were			2
young players , no matter how outrageous their talent , can not carry their teams in times of trouble			0
it is too much to ask of them			0
@entity1 is young and inexperienced , and it is a man ’s job to guide a team through a crisis			2
@entity10 gave @entity211 twisted blood down the left flank and had all the room in the world to cut in he made enough room for himself to swing his left peg at it and get a decent enough cross over , but @entity20 were afraid to commit			1
you sensed that @entity21 would be rampant here and they were			2
young players , no matter how outrageous their talent , can not carry their teams in times of trouble			0
it is too much to ask of them			0
he did ok , nothing special here			0
@entity21 were far too good to let @entity1 , or any other @entity20 player for that matter , make an impact on this game			1
the one time he got away in the first half he drew a foul from @entity81 , a clumsy challenge that earned the @entity231 midfielder a booking			0
@entity10 celebrates making the difference for @entity21 in the first half - while @entity1 watched on @entity10 unleashes one of six shots he had during his time on the pitch before being subbed off still , what a place to learn			1
he discovered how cute defenders are at the very highest level when @entity77 pinched the ball off his toes at the start of the second half			0
in the @entity245 he would have held on to the ball and been able to spin off his marker			0
there was no chance of @entity77 letting him get away with that here			0
even after the break , when @entity92 switched his tactics and played without a recognised central striker , @entity21 were impenetrable			0
@entity75 , who kept @entity1 subdued , will be marking @entity11 at the weekend when @entity153 arrive at the @entity253 for the @entity254 of the season			0
no - one , not even @entity1 , can tire of watching @entity21			1
@entity10 rises at the near post to head away a @entity20 corner and help ease defensive worries for @entity21 the world player of the year was applauded off by the home fans after a brilliant performance			1

@entity10 had never scored at @entity26 - but did on wednesday
@entity1 had an advanced role for @entity20 but *struggled*
@entity1 must learn from the world 's greatest to succeed him
