by @entity0 for @entity1 early mammals alive when dinosaurs roamed the @entity5 were picky eaters , new research suggests			1
analysis of tiny fossil mammals from @entity9 is shedding new light on the function and diets of our earliest ancestors			2
for many people , mere mention of the word @entity17 conjures up images of huge dinosaurs chomping their way through lush vegetation - and each other			2
analyses of fossilised mammals discovered in @entity9 are shedding light on the creatures ’ diets			2
the teeth of @entity29 and @entity30 ( pictured left and right ) hunted their prey on the island they shared , which is now @entity35 , @entity9 , and are different insects however , mammals and their immediate ancestors were also around in the @entity17 period , from 201 to 145 million years ago , albeit as rather less spectacular creatures			1
the shrew - sized , early @entity17 mammals were thought to have been confined to the ecological margins , eating whatever insects they could find			1
however , this was also the time when new mammal characteristics - such as better hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing - were developing			2
palaeontologists from the universities of @entity53 and @entity54 studied shrew - sized early @entity17 mammals , which were originally thought to have eaten any insects that they could find			1
by studying their teeth , they found that two of the earliest mammals , @entity29 and @entity30 , were not generalised insectivores but had already evolved specialised diets , feeding on distinct types of insects			1
the experts were interested in whether competition was driving the evolution of features such as better hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing			0
so , they studied the fossils of @entity29 and @entity30 found in @entity35 , @entity9 which 200 million years ago consisted of a series of small islands in a shallow continental sea			1
mammals scurried alongside the dinosaurs between 201 and 145 million years ago			1
a footprint made by a theropod in what is now the south coast of @entity78 is pictured			0
unlike with some dinosaur fossils , none of the mammal fossils have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters in @entity78			1
the tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world and their precise location has largely remained a secret			0
but blundering fossil hunters have damaged the footprints by filling one with plaster of @entity98 and hammering it in a bid to remove their plaster cast			0
they also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since @entity17 times			2
an investigation has been launched to assess the damage and track down the culprits			0
mr @entity110 discovered the damage while taking a party of 10 students to the site at @entity115 , between @entity116 and @entity117 , on the @entity9 coast			0
the footprints are believed to have been left by three - toed meat - eating theropod dinosaurs , that walked on their hind legs			0
some wider four - toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours			0
the footprints were made by some of the earliest dinosaurs in the world and it is possible that ancestral crocodile - like replies walked among them			2
at the time , the site lay in the arid north belt of the equator and @entity9 was a hot desert			0
lead author , dr @entity136 of the @entity137 explained : ‘ none of the fossils of the earliest mammals have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet			1
' instead we used a range of new techniques which we applied to our fossil finds of broken jaws and isolated teeth			0
‘ our results confirm that the diversification of mammalian species at the time was linked with differences in diet and ecology			0
’ the team studied x-rays and ct scans to reveal the internal anatomy of the creatures ’ tiny jaws , which are only 2cm in length			0
as the jaws are in many pieces , the scans were ' stitched together ' to make a complete digital reconstruction			0
finite element modelling – a technique used to design hip joints and bridges - was used to analyse the strength of the animals ’ jaws , according to the study published in the journal @entity178			0
the technique showed that @entity30 and @entity29 had very different abilities for catching and chewing prey			2
the teeth of @entity29 and @entity30 had different patterns of microscopic pits and scratches , known as ' microwear '			1
this indicated they were eating different things with @entity29 favouring harder , crunchier food items such as beetles while @entity30 selected softer foods such as scorpion flies which were common at the time			1
professor @entity194 of the @entity54 said : ‘ this is the first time that tooth wear patterns have been used to analyse the diet of mammals this old			1
‘ that their tooth wear compares so closely to bats that specialise on different kinds of insects gives us really strong evidence that these early mammals were not generalists when it came to diet , but were quite definite in their food choices			1
’ team leader , professor @entity210 from the @entity137 added : ‘ this study is important as it shows for the first time that the features that make us unique as mammals , such as having only one set of replacement teeth and a specialised jaw joint and hearing apparatus , were associated with the very earliest mammals beginning to specialise their teeth and jaws to eat different things			1

mammals scurried alongside the dinosaurs 145 to 201 million years ago
@entity226 palaeontologists studied shrew - sized early @entity17 mammals
by examining their teeth , they found that two of the earliest mammals , @entity29 and @entity30 , were not generalised insectivores
creatures had evolved specialised diets , feeding on distinct types of insects
@entity29 liked crunchier food items such as beetles while @entity30 selected softer foods such as scorpion flies
is the first time that tooth wear patterns have been used to analyse the diet of mammals this old
