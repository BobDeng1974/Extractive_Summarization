@entity13 submariner @entity11 is stationed on a submarine in the @entity15 me and my dad : @entity20 lawyers argue he should be protected by the @entity50 , which states courts in custody cases may grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days to defendants serving their country step - mom : @entity24 has been living with @entity20 wife @entity59 her step - mother in @entity2 while @entity20 is deployed aboard a nuclear submarine in the @entity15 serving his country : military lawyers are now joining the effort to get a delay in the case			1

@entity20 ’ lawyers argue he should be protected by the @entity50 , which states courts in custody cases may ' grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days ' to defendants serving their country			0

where will she go ? @entity20 was given permanent custody of @entity24 in 2010 , after she was reportedly removed from his ex-wife 's @entity22 's home by child protective services @entity120 had secured money to pay for a flight to @entity17 to hand @entity24 over to her mother but does not have the money needed for a rental car deployed dad : the sailor is not allowed to appear by @entity127 or phone , and in custody cases , being absent in court could have a huge effect on the outcome plan : @entity59 ( right ) says they have no choice			1
she 's going to fly back to @entity17 with @entity24 to be in court monday with the possibility the ex-wife will get temporary custody and the sailor wo n't be there to say goodbye she has a point : he 's protecting the rights of others , but who 's protecting his rights ? @entity59 said @entity20 is not even allowed to appear by @entity127 or phone			1
