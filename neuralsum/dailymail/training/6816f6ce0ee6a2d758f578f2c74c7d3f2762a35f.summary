‘ the drama is nonstop , ’ warns @entity6 , who has revealed that he and wife @entity11 long for their older , simpler lives back			2
back in august , he and 15 co-workers from the @entity16 shared one of three winning tickets for a $ 450 million @entity20 jackpot prize			1
sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures , a t - shirt promoting the popular @entity34 reality show @entity33 , camouflage pants , sun glasses and a long beard , @entity6 gleefully proclaimed that he and his co-workers were ‘ very happy , happy , happy			1
’ ‘ this is my best outfit , ’ he jokingly said of his casual getup			0
@entity6 ’s natural charm caught the eye of the tv networks and the next morning he and @entity11 appeared on the today show , where he pledged he was going to spend his days fishing , hunting and generally do whatever he pleased			1
he now admits that all that tv exposure was a big mistake as his high profile meant he was quickly inundated with visits not only from long - lost relatives and beggars , but also from what felt like every reality tv producer in the country			1
leave me alone ! ' @entity8 ' @entity6 says he has been hounded by long - lost relatives , beggars and reality tv producers since winning the lottery last month @entity6 said he had to buy a .357 magnum shotgun ‘ for protection ’ and pointed it at the last people who came knocking on his door			1
the visits have since stopped , but @entity6 says his phone has n’t stopped ringing with offers from the likes of @entity72 , @entity34 and @entity73 - all keen to follow his every move with their cameras			2
‘ would you want a camera following you around all day when you finally have the time to go hunting and fishing and do all the things you wanted to do ? ’ he told @entity76			2
‘ they put me in the @entity83 , next to @entity84 and @entity85			0
i mean i ai n’t into all that			0
’ ‘ there are days i wish we were back to just getting paid every two weeks , ’ he said			0
‘ you have to change your whole way of life , but we did n’t want to change the way we lived			0
we liked the way we lived			0
’ @entity11 has gone as far as to call their lottery win - fall as ‘ the curse , ’ but the couple would n’t be giving the money back and have already spent much of it			2
after taxes , @entity6 ’s share amounted to just under $ 4 million , which , he said ‘ ai n’t s * * * in today ’s economy			1
’ that did n't stop both him and his wife from leaving their jobs and buying new cars			0
they ’ve also paid off their mortgage and put a new roof on their home which had been battered by @entity113 last year			0
@entity6 has also been sure to help other family members			2
he funded a second round of chemotherapy for his father who is now recovering , he helped one son buy a house and another to start a master ’s degree			0
back at the press conference in august @entity6 also said that he was going to buy ‘ a log cabin on multiple acres of land			1
’ ' just disappear ' : @entity6 plans to move to a remote log cabin next month , full - time , so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and also avoid people hounding him he plans to move to his remote cabin next month , full - time , so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and conveniently avoiding people			1

‘ just disappear , ’ is @entity6 's advice			2
