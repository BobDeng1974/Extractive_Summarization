by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 07:32 est , 11 september 2013 this is the moment an innocent puffin trying to feed its young was robbed by a greedy gull			1
having scoured the @entity7 coast for food , the helpless victim had not noticed a predator watching from a nearby rock			1
it was not until he hit the jackpot and set off for home clutching a batch of five sand eels that the gull made its move			1
success : with a batch of sand eels in its iconic beak the doting parent gets ready to head home @entity24 seems clear : he sets off , clutching the meal			1
not far from his roost , it should n't be a long flight noticing a second too late , the puffin tried to change course			2
but the bigger bird was ready			2
in an alarming display of survival - of - the - fittest , the pair tumbled to the ground of the @entity37 in a bid to win the meal			1
the incredible scene , captured by amateur photographer @entity41 , escalated on dry land			1
the determined puffin made a run for it on foot			1
and despite being apprehended by the savvy gull , all was not lost for the breadwinner who proudly walked away with one of the two remaining fish			2
puffin enthusiast mr @entity41 , 50 , said : ' i saw the gull spot the puffin whilst on a rocky outcrop , as it took to the air , the puffin saw it and tried to change direction			1
shock : out of nowhere a giant predator swoops			0
the black - headed gull tries to turn to grab the eels attacked : the puffin had caught some sand eels off the coast of the @entity37 in @entity7 ' the gull attempted to hood its wings around the puffin and pecked at its fish - laden bill			1
' the gull managed to dislodge a small sand eel , as this dropped from the air another bird spotted it and got to it before the gull			1
' the gull managed to get a fish from the puffin , once this happened the gull seemed to leave the puffin alone			2
' it got back to its burrow with some fish intact			0
' puffins are phenomenal swimmers and hunters as they adopt a flying technique under water			0
in the air , they beat their wings rapidly , over 400 times - per - minute			0
plan b : the tussle moves to dry land where the determined puffin tries to leg it with his food still intact relieved but exhausted : usually known for its speed , this puffin only took home some of his earnings the black - headed gull is an arch - nemesis of the @entity114 breed , which resides in the @entity115			1
to avoid danger , the black and white auks tend to fly together in confusing formations			0
their fast pace and stark colours alarm predators			0
fascinated by these black and white creatures , known for their super-fast swimming technique , mr @entity41 from @entity123 , @entity124 , planned this photography expedition months ago			1
lucky : during the tussle a nearby tern made off with one of the prized snacks as the gull and puffin fought away he said : ' for many years i have had an interest in the outdoors and the countryside , working several dogs on large @entity124 estates			2
' i have always had a liking for @entity140 , this comical bird , but wanted to photograph them during the breeding season when they spend time on land			1
' @entity145 , the largest island in the @entity146 , near @entity147 , is named after the @entity149 word for ' puffin ' puffins are the symbol of @entity154 and @entity155 province in @entity156 , and the namesake of @entity145 ( from ' lund ' , the @entity149 word for puffin )			0
the iconic birds are still hunted and eaten in the @entity161 and @entity162			0
there are three types of puffin , which are members of the auk family			0
the @entity168 , an almost black creature , is native to the @entity169			0
the @entity170 , with a fleshy horn above its beak , resides in cold climates like @entity174 and @entity175			0
the @entity114 , or ' common puffin ' , is native to the @entity177 and the @entity115			0
puffins are known for their ability to swim			0
they soar through the water , flapping their wings as if flying through the air			0
in a technique unrivalled by other land - based creatures , the black and white creatures have become adept at hunting .			2

@entity140 did not know predator was watching when he caught five sand eels off @entity37 coast near @entity7
black - headed gull swooped and *wrapped* its wing around the helpless bird
the pair tumbled to the ground where puffin tried to run to *safety*
