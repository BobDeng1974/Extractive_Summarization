by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 are leading a growing revolt by landowners against the government ’s @entity6 rail line			2
a string of aristocratic families are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying @entity11 to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form			1
they have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will blight property prices , carve up @entity21 ’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls			2
@entity1 pictured with his wife @entity23 , right , complains the rail link will go through his ancestral estate in @entity26 , left , which the family abandoned during the @entity28 the new objectors , including prince @entity31 ’s close friends @entity32 and @entity33 and the @entity35 ’s descendant lord @entity34 , have made their views public in official petitions to @entity11 asking for amendments to the @entity39 paving the way for the proposed £ 50 billion link from @entity42 to @entity43			1
the scheme , which the government argues will boost @entity21 ’s economy , will cut the 1 hour 21 minute journey time from @entity42 to @entity43 by 32 minutes			2
the objectors complain that the link will ‘ sever ’ their estates , cause ‘ intolerable noise ’ and adversely affect wildlife and areas of outstanding natural beauty			1
the @entity55 left the @entity56 in @entity57 , pictured , when the moved to @entity58 in @entity59 in 1645 and they are calling for a long list of changes including tunnelling , fences to protect wildlife , higher compensation payments and anti-noise barriers			2
princess @entity67 ’s brother @entity1 has submitted his petition because the line is earmarked to go through the @entity70 in @entity57			2
the @entity1 family lived in the manor until 1645 , but abandoned it for the @entity58 estate in @entity59 during the @entity28			0
in the petition the @entity1 and the other trustees of the estate complain their land will be ‘ severed ’ by the proposed @entity6 rail line			1
the document says @entity45 plans to acquire parts of the land through compulsory purchase , needed to dump excavated earth , are of particular concern and brands the compensation scheme ‘ inadequate ’			0
the @entity6 link is being opposed by a section of aristocrats who complain the rail link will cause them nuisance and disruption another issue raised is that the @entity6 construction will exacerbate ‘ the problems associated with rabbits and deer ’ , with @entity1 calling for fencing to be installed to protect the estate , which encompasses the 16th century @entity102			1
a second petition by @entity2 raises concerns that part of the @entity106 in @entity107 , given by his family to the @entity110 , will be hacked off when the @entity6 route is driven through it			0
he speaks of the ‘ intolerable ’ noise and dust expected from the works , as well as warning of the possible reduction in visitors to the estate			1
@entity121 , a childhood friend of prince @entity31 , and his wife @entity123 are equally upset about the havoc the @entity6 line looks set to wreak in their bucolic corner of @entity128			1
the pair live in @entity130 , @entity107 – a few hundred feet from the route			0
army @entity132 warned in his petition : ‘ public right of ways will be stripped of their rural nature and tranquillity by @entity6			0
your petitioner and family will also suffer years of disruption and difficulty from the construction			0
’ @entity146 backed suggestions it would be better for the high - speed trains to go through a ‘ bored tunnel ’			1
meanwhile lord @entity34 , who owns a farm on the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity59 , which will be bisected by the @entity6 route , also made his discontent clear			0
the upper - class rebellion brewing in the @entity158 heartlands is likely to come as fresh embarrassment to the government , which has experienced opposition to @entity6 from the ranks of @entity158 mps			1
the @entity164 has also entered a petition			0
it demands the government backtrack on powers allowing them during the construction work to disturb war memorials and first world war graves , without informing the @entity164			0
@entity172 , from the @entity173 , said last night : ‘ the proposals before @entity11 for @entity6 will , unless radically changed , destroy the setting of some of the country ’s most historic houses			0

objectors complain high - speed link will cause ' intolerable noise '
opponents include prince @entity31 *'s* close friend @entity185
