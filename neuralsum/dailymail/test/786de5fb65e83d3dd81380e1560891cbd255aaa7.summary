@entity0 has called on the advice and support of former @entity4 managers @entity5 and @entity6 as tensions grow between the club and its fanbase			1
supporters are planning to boycott today ’s game at home to @entity13 in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner @entity19			1
@entity0 was in the dugout alongside @entity6 at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3 - 0 victory over @entity26			1
@entity6 was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside @entity29			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors @entity6 was in charge of @entity4 from 2010 to january this year , when he left for @entity35 former @entity4 striker @entity5 , the club 's record goal - scorer , also had a brief stint as manager @entity4 fans are planning to protest against owner @entity19 for a perceived lack of ambition sunday 's protests will take place outside of the stadium , but @entity0 – who , in fairness , has been left with a depleted and disinterested squad - could nonetheless find himself the target should his side fall to a sixth straight defeat			1
carver , though , accepts that he must take criticism and has spoken to the likes of @entity6 and close friend @entity5 , who was relegated as boss in 2009 , for words of encouragement			1
‘ some of the advice i ’ve had has been excellent			2
it ’s definitely changed me as a person in how i ’ve dealt with things because , in the past , i would have reacted to what people have said and some of the things that have been written , ’ he said			0
‘ both alans have excellent experience at it and that ’s why i ’m listening to what they are saying			0
without a shadow of a doubt they have helped me through this			0
‘ we are not through it yet but they have been excellent for me , along with many other people in the game			0
’ he added : ‘ but the club realise the situation i ’m in and they realise that it ’s a difficult one , and that ’s why i ’m convinced they are going to have to invest			2
‘ whether it ’s me or whether it 's sir @entity81 doing this job , they would need investment			2
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , does not expect a repeat of the poison of 12 months ago when they take on @entity13			1
‘ the @entity26 game was one of the strangest atmospheres i ’ve ever experienced , ’ he said			0
‘ we got through it in the end			0
i hope it wo n’t be as difficult an atmosphere this time			0
@entity96 fans are planning to boycott the next home game with @entity13 and have designed @entity99 leaflets @entity4 players are put through their paces in training ahead of the home game with @entity13 on sunday @entity4 winger @entity102 strikes a shot at goal during a training session ahead of the @entity13 match ‘ i do n’t think it will be , i think it will be a different type of protest			1
the fact that people are staying away , the people who come into the stadium will be behind the team because they understand where we are and everyone will be in it together			0
’ and @entity0 believes that the home double - header with @entity13 and @entity120 will determine how the rest of their season plays out			2
‘ i think these next two could define the season , because if we do n’t pick up results it just adds a bit more pressure , ’ he added			2
‘ sometimes pressure can take over and we do n’t want to leave ourselves in that situation			0
