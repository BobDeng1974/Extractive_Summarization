the @entity1 official in charge of assessing the damage caused by the leaking of classified document by former @entity8 contractor @entity6 said earlier this week that making a deal to grant @entity6 amnesty in exchange for the documents he still has is something worth considering			1
@entity15 , who was put in charge of the @entity6 leak task - force by general @entity18 , was interviewed for an upcoming episode of 60 minutes , and says that because of the damage @entity6 could potentially do with the information he still has in his possession , cutting him a deal might be in the best interest of the country			1
' so , my personal view is , yes , [ granting @entity6 amnesty ] is worth having a conversation about , ' @entity15 tells 60 minutes corespondent @entity28			1
' i would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured , and my bar for those assurances would be very high			1
it would be more than just an assertion on his part			0
' @entity15 , who heads a task force assessing @entity6 's leaks , says the @entity1 should consider granting him amnesty in all , @entity15 says @entity6 is likely to still be in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents as he waits in asylum in @entity44			1
@entity15 's boss , @entity18 , does n't share his belief that @entity6 should be allowed to evade punishment for stealing the documents			1
' this is analogous to a hostage - taker taking 50 people hostage , shooting 10 and then say , " if you give me full amnesty , i 'll let the other 40 go			0
" what do you do , ' @entity18 says			2
meanwhile , the @entity8 has made dozens of changes in its operations and computer networks to prevent the emergence of another @entity6 , including potential disciplinary action , a top @entity8 official said on friday , as a @entity64 review panel recommended restraints on @entity8 spying			2
in the more than hour - long interview with @entity68 , @entity15 acknowledged the agency had done a poor job in its initial public response to revelations of vast @entity8 monitoring of phone and @entity76 data ; pledged more transparency ; and said he was deeply worried about highly classified documents not yet public that are among the 1.7 million @entity6 is believed to have accessed			1
he also stoutly defended the @entity8 's mission of tracking terrorist plots and other threats , and said its recruiting of young codebreakers , linguists and computer geeks has not been affected by the @entity6 affair - even as internal morale has been			1
' any time you trust people , there is always a chance that someone will betray you , ' he said			0
bargaining @entity95 : authorities say @entity6 still has 1.5 million classified documents in his possession the @entity8 is taking 41 specific technical measures to control data by tagging and tracking it , to supervise agency networks with controls on activity , and to increase oversight of individuals			1
measures include requiring two - person control of every place where someone could access data and enhancing the security process that people go through and requiring more frequent screenings of systems administrative access , @entity15 said			2
after months of sometimes blistering criticism in the news media and by @entity120 and foreign governments , the publicity - averse @entity8 is now mounting an effort to tell its side of the @entity6 story			2
@entity15 , a 36 - year intelligence veteran who reportedly is in line to be the agency 's deputy director , joked that doing media interviews was ' a complete out - of - body experience for me			1
' he spoke to @entity68 on the same day that the @entity64 said it had decided to maintain the practice of having a single individual head both the @entity8 and @entity132 , which conducts cyberwarfare - an outcome the @entity8 leadership favored			0
separately , news reports late thursday said an outside review panel appointed by the @entity64 has recommended changes in a program disclosed by @entity6 that collects basic data on @entity1 ' phone calls - known as metadata			2
the panel reportedly said the data should be held by an organization other than the @entity8 and stricter rules should be enforced for searching the databanks			0
asylum : @entity6 remains in asylum in @entity44 , where he is in possession of more than 1.5 million classified documents @entity15 declined to discuss the panel 's specific recommendations			1
but he seemed to acknowledge that tighter guidelines for @entity8 eavesdropping were in the offing , saying that what is technologically possible " has gotten ahead of policy			0
" @entity6 , who is living under asylum in @entity44 , disclosed a vast @entity1 eavesdropping apparatus that includes the phone metadata program ; @entity8 querying of internet communications via major companies such as @entity164 and @entity165 ; and widespread tapping of international communication networks			1
@entity15 made no apologies for what many see as overly aggressive @entity8 monitoring			2
he noted that the @entity1 government 's intelligence taskings to the agency run to 36,000 pages , and said its activities take place within a ' box ' of @entity1 laws and policies			0
' we 'll color in every square millimeter of that box , ' he said , implying the @entity8 will use its legal authorities to the fullest extent possible			0
the @entity8 's internal review has determined about 98 percent of the scope of the material that @entity6 had accessed , and officials have found no evidence that he had help either within the @entity8 or from adversary spy agencies			1
@entity15 said that when @entity6 was downloading the documents , @entity8 was ahead of other intelligence agencies in installing " insider threat " software that president @entity195 ordered in the wake of an earlier leak scandal involving the group @entity198			1
but installation of the software , which might have stopped @entity6 , was not complete			2
' @entity6 hit at a really opportune time			2
for him - not for us , ' he said			0
not unanimous : general @entity18 does n't agree that @entity6 should be granted amnesty in exchange for documents @entity15 said that most of the @entity6 material released publicly so far has been about @entity8 programs and partnerships with foreign countries and companies , rather than intelligence reports and ' requirements			1
' the latter refers to @entity1 government taskings to the @entity8 to answer questions about specific targets			0
that last category is what keeps him up at night			0
' those make me nervous because they reveal what we know and what we do n't know and they are almost a roadmap for adversaries			0
' no one at the @entity8 has yet lost their job over the @entity6 crisis , including at the @entity232 site where he worked			2
@entity15 said three people are under review for potential disciplinary action , but declined further comment			0
he challenged those who call @entity6 a whistleblower , saying the former contractor did not use multiple channels available to vent his concerns			0
' i actually think characterizing him as a whistleblower is a disservice to people who are whistleblowers			0
' @entity15 said he knew of no @entity1 government move toward reaching any kind of a legal deal with @entity6 , a decision that would be up to the @entity250			1
but , he said in his opinion , such a conversation would have to include concrete assurances that @entity6 would secure any of the material he has that has not yet been made public			1
in the aftermath of @entity6 , the @entity8 is trying to be more open about what it does so the public can have more confidence in the agency 's mission			1
' we as an agency are a little naive , for a long time we were '' @entity8 '' or '' no comment '' and were not adept at presenting our face to the public , ' he said			0
' i think quite frankly had we done more of that over the last five or 10 years we might not be in the same place that we are vis - a - vis the public perception of who we are and what we do , ' he said			0
' so too late to learn that lesson , so what you are seeing now is our new face			0

@entity15 says he would need assurances that the documents still in @entity6 's possession could be secured
