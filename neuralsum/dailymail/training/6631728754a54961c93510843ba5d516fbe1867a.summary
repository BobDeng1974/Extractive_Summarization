by @entity0 @entity0 : ' @entity1 is the silver bullet who will give the @entity4 a majority ' i wrote in this newspaper back in february that @entity8 should deploy the @entity10 secret weapon and invite @entity1 back into the @entity12 fold			1
with @entity1 batting for the team , we have a much stronger chance of winning the next general election			1
@entity1 is our perfect @entity19 weapon			1
following his strongly @entity21 speech last week , @entity1 will undoubtedly coax back the voters who have temporarily left the conservatives and dallied with @entity24			1
if anyone could be the silver bullet needed to take us clear across the majority line , the mayor of @entity26 is it			2
a victory for @entity8 and @entity33 removes any leadership vacancy			2
however , @entity1 may have a further opportunity			1
in 2017 , @entity8 has pledged a referendum on @entity37 following renegotiation talks			2
it is well known that he will campaign for a @entity41 vote to stay in			2
following his speech last week , it is very possible @entity1 will campaign for a no vote			1
if he does and the no vote wins , the pressure will be on @entity8 to resign			0
the question then will be which candidates mps put forward to the party membership to elect as leader			0
for the past 20 years , @entity33 has carefully plotted his rise through the ranks			0
during reshuffles , he placed his acolytes in key positions			0
he has located his unofficial cheerleader for his campaign as future leader , @entity60 , in the seat of chief whip			0
this means he has the controller of backbench opinion in his pocket			0
six months ago , @entity60 attended a private dinner with @entity68			0
during the evening , he verbally disparaged both @entity1 and @entity69 and condemned them both as potential leaders			1
@entity33 is anxious that none of @entity68 ’s newspaper titles support @entity1			1
@entity60 is nothing if not a loyal servant to the present leadership , therefore it can only be assumed the comments were made not only with prior approval , but were planned			0
but it is inconceivable that @entity1 would not be one of the final two choices for next leader			1
however , he has a great deal of work to do first			0
whereas @entity1 may have deployed a light touch on immigration as @entity26 mayor , his message will need to alter dramatically to convince @entity89			1
they will want to hear him say a @entity91 ‘ no , no , no , ’ to open borders			0
@entity1 needs to remind those mps of his track record of success			1
he took an ailing @entity26 and has transformed it into a leading metropolis on the global stage			0
if he can climb that mountain and reassure all mps , @entity1 is indeed on course to be our next leader			1
supporters of @entity1 ( left ) are said to be privately vowing to force prime minister @entity8 ( right ) to quit if he tries to form a second @entity105 with the @entity106 , it has emerged but what of @entity33 ? he will already be aware that a continuity candidate , in the form of himself or may , will not be acceptable to mps or the party membership			1
the choice will be between @entity1 and a member of the 2010 intake			2
my guess is that @entity33 will already be negotiating with such an mp and helping to position them as a potential leadership candidate			0
the deal being that @entity33 will persuade his people , the mps he has rewarded and groomed over years , to support that candidate			0
there is no mp in any party with the combination of talent and achievement that can rival the @entity1 stardust			2
unfortunately for @entity33 , he is already yesterday ’s man .			0

' with @entity1 batting for the team , we have much stronger chance at election '
@entity138 claims @entity1 is ' perfect @entity19 weapon '
