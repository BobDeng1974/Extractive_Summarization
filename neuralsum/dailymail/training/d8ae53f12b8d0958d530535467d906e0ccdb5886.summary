three furry critters with a voracious sexual appetite have been discovered in @entity2			0
the shaggy - haired marsupials have marathon mating sessions that are so vigorous they often prove fatal to the male			1
@entity8 scientists discovered the new species , which are about the same size as a mouse and enjoys - or endures - a mating season that lasts for several weeks			2
the black - tailed antichinus ' sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time , with both the males and females romping from mate to mate ' it ’s a very exciting time to be a mammalogist , ' said @entity20 , head of the @entity22 team who made the discoveries			1
' typically there ’s only a couple of new species of mammals found worldwide each year			2
so to find three new species of this marsupial , all in @entity32 is really exciting , ' he told @entity33			2
one of the creatures , named the black - tailed antechinus , has been found in the high - altitude , wet areas of far southeast @entity32 and northeast @entity37			1
scientists from the @entity39 explained about the die - off of @entity41 when the species was discovered last year			2
it is presumed that the new black - tailed species behaves in a similar way			1
researchers had imaged that the males were altruistic and died so that there was more food for their offspring , but biologist @entity51 showed the animals were over-doing it to promote their own genes over their competitors ’			0
they try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down			0
researchers found the huge rush of stress hormones , which have enabled the animals to keep at it over a mating period of a few weeks , also causes their body tissues to ‘ disintegrate ’			0
their fur falls out , they stagger around , bleed internally and sometimes get painful gangrene infections as their immune system stops working - before dying			0
@entity68 reef squid , @entity70 salmon and plenty of arachnids also engage in semelparous , or ' big - bang reproduction '			0
but it is rare for mammals to employ such desperate mating tactics			0
it is identifiable by a very shaggy , hairy coat with long guard hairs and an orangey - brown coloured rump , which ends with a black tail			1
but its incredible sexual appetite and strenuous mating sessions are arguably its most noteworthy feature			0
sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time , with both the males and females romping from mate to mate			1
‘ it 's frenetic , there 's no courtship , the males will just grab the females and both will mate promiscuously , ’ dr @entity20 told @entity90			1
the mating season lasts for several weeks and the males will typically die from their exertions			0
excessive stress hormones in the males that build up during the mating season degrade their body tissue , leading to death , whereas females have the ability to block the production of the hormone , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity110			2
scientists discovered the carnivorous antechinus last year , which is closely related to the newly discovered black - tailed antechinus and also dies from its stressful and marathon mating sessions			1
dr @entity20 told @entity116 that the black - tailed antechinus ’ sex sessions ‘ probably follow the typical pattern of antechinus , which is all males are dead before they turn one year old ’			1
the creatures typically have their frenzied mating period when they are around 11 months old and ‘ all males will die before the young are born , ’ he said			0
the male @entity41 , which was discovered last year , die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time			1
they try so hard to reproduce that their bodies shut down the black - tailed antechinus was found at the highest peak of the @entity135 listed @entity134 , in @entity136 in @entity32 , about 560 miles ( 900 km ) north east of @entity137 , but the researchers are unsure how many of the species exist			1
dr @entity20 said : ' it ’s been trapped there , at the very highest point of the rainforest at 1,000 metres , where you get fog dripping onto the plants			0
with its big shaggy coat , it probably likes the coldest and wettest environment possible			2
the rainforest habitat in which the strange animals live is dwindling and ' the animals who ca n’t fly or move very far become trapped and they become very different because they can no longer interbreed , ' he added			0
dr @entity20 ad his team have applied for the black - tailed antechinus to be listed as an endangered species .			1

the black - tailed antechinus has been found in the high - altitude , wet areas of far southeast @entity32 and northeast @entity37
it is identifiable by a very shaggy , hairy coat with long guard hairs and an orangey - brown coloured rump , which ends with a black tail
sex sessions can last for to 14 hours at a time , with both the males and females romping from mate to mate
