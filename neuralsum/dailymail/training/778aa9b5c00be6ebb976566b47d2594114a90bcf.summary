family doctors have been given detailed guidance on spotting cancer amid fears they are dismissing early warning signs as harmless			1
for the first time , gps have been told to refer patients with seemingly banal symptoms , such as a cough or tiredness , for urgent tests within 48 hours			1
@entity12 , the @entity14 watchdog which has issued the guidelines , warns that delays in spotting signs of cancer is ‘ costing the lives of thousands of people ’ every year			1
the @entity14 watchdog @entity12 says thousands of lives are being lost every year by @entity5 not refering cancer patients for blood tests and x-rays soon enough , and has issued new guidelines the @entity27 has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in @entity30 and , for some types of the disease , it is even behind @entity34 and @entity35			1
this is partly thought to be because gps are not referring patients for tests when they show up with potentially confusing symptoms such as a cough , abdominal pain or tiredness			1
but experts also worry that patients are too stoical and do not want to trouble the doctor with what they assume is a minor ache or pain			2
the guidance urges @entity5 to refer patients for blood tests , scans or x-rays within 48 hours if they have certain ‘ unobvious ’ symptoms that may have a variety of explanations			1
these are persistent tiredness , bruising , bleeding , or fever in youngsters			2
they could be the first signs of leukaemia , lung cancer or brain cancer			2
in some circumstances , @entity5 must refer patients for hospital tests within hours			1
these include children who have woken repeatedly vomiting or with headaches			0
professor @entity71 , of @entity12 , said : ‘ the problem is a lot of cancer symptoms can be very general and similar to those of other conditions			1
unless it is a cancer - related sign or symptom we are very familiar with – a lump in the breast for instance – many people wo n’t think about the possibility of cancer			0
‘ it is not always easy for @entity5 to spot cancer either			0
there are more than 200 different types so it is unrealistic to expect them to know every single sign of each one , especially when they only see a handful of new cases a year			0
but early referral and diagnosis can help save lives			0
’ figures have shown that a quarter of cancer patients saw their gp at least three times before they were referred for a test at hospital			2
many have rarer cancers which their gp may only see a few times in their career			0
health secretary @entity111 pledged in june to name and shame @entity5 with poor records on sending patients for cancer tests			1
@entity116 , of @entity117 , said : ‘ these guidelines should give them more options to get patients referred quickly			0
but to be truly effective doctors need better access to diagnostic tests and speedy results			2
’ doctors are being told to send patients with ' unbvious ' symptoms which could have a number of explanations - such as a cough or fatigue - for cancer screening tests the guidance came as it emerged that thousands of cancer patients are waiting too long to start vital treatment			1
official quarterly figures revealed that for the third time this year the @entity14 has missed its target of ensuring at least 85 per cent of patients undergo surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or receive other drugs , within 62 days after being referred by a specialist			2
over the last three months only 83.5 per cent of 33,404 were treated in 62 days			0
a third of hospitals breached the target , including some where just half of patients were treated in 62 days			0
@entity149 , of @entity117 , said : ‘ these targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis and access to treatment , which is vital if we ’re serious about having the best survival rates			0
‘ these breaches have become a trend and they are worsening			0
