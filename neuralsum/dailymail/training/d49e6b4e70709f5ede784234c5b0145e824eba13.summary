by @entity0 published : 05:53 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 17:28 est , 26 july 2012 @entity1 has ruled out @entity2 giving up his political strategy role to focus on being chancellor			1
despite fierce criticism of mr @entity2 for grim economic figures , the prime minister told colleagues that @entity10 and the @entity11 working hand in hand was a ‘ strength , not a weakness ’			1
but @entity14 , a former @entity15 chief whip , has claimed both men are ‘ obsessed with management of 24 - hour news ’ and called for there to be a ‘ full - time ’ chancellor			1
rivals : @entity22 says he would ' probably ' make a good replacement for @entity2 , right conservative backbencher @entity25 said he would ‘ rather @entity2 concentrated on running the economy ’ and @entity27 , a persistent backbench critic of the party leadership , called for foreign secretary @entity29 to be made chancellor			1
senior government sources said the idea that mr @entity2 would be moved from the @entity11 in a september reshuffle was ‘ completely absurd ’			1
mr @entity1 is also determined that the chancellor should not step back from helping decide political tactics			1
‘ it is a strength , at a time of economic crisis , to have a chancellor who regularly attends meetings at @entity10 , ’ said one ally of the prime minister			2
@entity2 does n’t have some second job doing strategy so there is nothing for him to give up			1
he and @entity1 have always been very close , and they work in lockstep , which is a strength of this government			2
‘ look back to @entity50 and @entity51 if you want an example of what happens when a prime minister and a chancellor work against instead of with each other			2
’ mr @entity1 is however expected to appoint a powerful new party chairman in the autumn , with housing minister @entity61 favourite to take the job			1
the current chairman , @entity63 , is tipped to be made international development secretary or @entity65 in the reshuffle			0
@entity22 , who prompted uproar on wednesday night by agreeing he ‘ probably would ’ make a good replacement for mr @entity2 , yesterday denied pushing for the job			1
knives out : @entity27 , right , has said that @entity2 should be sacked for the good of the country and the conservative party rivals ? : @entity1 and @entity74 walk with @entity22 and chancellor @entity2 tipped : @entity75 of the @entity15 party @entity29 has been touted to take the chancellor 's job should @entity2 go @entity22 , who prompted uproar on wednesday night by agreeing he ‘ probably would ’ make a good replacement for mr @entity2 , yesterday denied pushing for the job			1
‘ we are part of a team , we have a collectively agreed policy , and i ’m delivering on my bit of it , which centres particularly on the area of industrial strategy , and i ’m not proposing a radically different approach , ’ said the @entity82 business secretary			0
‘ i would be building on what @entity2 has already achieved			2
’ defence secretary @entity93 , meanwhile , also rejected the suggestion he could be in line to take over as chancellor			1
@entity14 , who was @entity98 ’s chief whip in the 1990s , insisted : ‘ he [ @entity2 ] ca n’t be de facto chairman of the @entity15 and chancellor at the same time			1
’ he claimed mr @entity2 and mr @entity1 were ‘ obsessed with management of 24 - hour news , they are news editors , news managers , they are no strategists ’			1
the partnership formed between @entity1 and his chancellor @entity2 is a strong one			1
not only are they from privileged backgrounds and former members of @entity113 's infamous @entity112 , they have stuck together ever since both reached the ranks of the @entity15 party			2
they are so close they made one another godfathers to each other 's children			0
mr @entity2 was campaign manager for @entity1 's leadership campaign in 2005			1
they have worked @entity123 ever since			0
but in 2009 the prime minister was asked if he would sack his friend if things were going badly , despite their firm friendship			0
' with @entity2 , the answer is yes , ' he said , ' he stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend , not because we are godfathers to each other 's children but because he is the right person to do the job			2
i know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there			0
' in 2010 , when asked again he said : ' yes			0
he is a good friend , but we ’ve has that conversation a number of times over the past four years			2
to be fair to @entity2 he said " if ever you want to move me to another job , it is your decision and it is your right "			2
' and following intense pressure from his own party , it appears that mr @entity1 may soon face the toughest decision of all - whether to fire his friend to protect his own career			1
‘ it is important the chancellor steps away from the immediate picture and tries to build a bigger one , ’ he added			2
‘ @entity11 deserves the chancellor to be there on a full - time basis and to ensure it develops a proper economic strategy			0
’ following official figures showing the economy has slumped by another 0.7 per cent , mr @entity2 won a welcome boost when the head of the international economic watchdog , the @entity162 , gave his strategy unequivocal backing			1
@entity167 , in @entity168 for the biggest investment conference ever held in the @entity170 , urged @entity170 to persevere with austerity measures that have helped deliver record low borrowing costs			2
‘ you are now sowing the seeds of what will be the elements for recovery , ’ said the @entity162 boss			2
‘ you have to have credible public finances before you start moving on growth			0
’ mr @entity2 , speaking at the event in @entity168 ’s @entity183 , insisted he had a relentless focus on the economy : ‘ we ’re dealing with our debts , we ’re creating the most pro-business tax regime in the developed world , and we ’re making the long - term structural reforms to secure a more productive future			1
’ at the same conference , mr @entity1 vowed to ‘ finish the job ’ of deficit reduction , despite calls to change course in the face of the worst double - dip recession in half a century			1
he said there was no question of abandoning the ‘ tough decisions ’ it had made			0
‘ be in no doubt , ’ he said			0
‘ we will finish the job			0
’ the prime minister said ministers were making the reforms needed to make @entity170 competitive , including shaking up the planning system and investing in infrastructure			0
but he faced tough questions from international business leaders , who voiced concerns that the @entity214 ’s immigration cap could be a barrier to recruiting the best staff			0
pledge : speaking at the @entity218 conference in @entity168 this morning , mr @entity1 said the government was trying top drum up business , a day after figures showed the country 's economy is in a deeper recession than previously thought damning : since the @entity214 took over in @entity225 of 2010 , gdp , despite encouraging initial figures , has shrunk by 0.3 % overall after a dire day yesterday @entity2 and pressure to resign he has received a welcome boost			1
the head of a major international economic organisation , who urged the chancellor to ' persevere ' and ' stay the course '			2
the support came from @entity167 , right , secretary general of the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) , who said austerity being imposed in @entity170 now was ' sowing the seeds of what will be the elements for recovery '			1
the @entity162 chief told @entity243 ’s today programme : ' i would say to the chancellor " stay the course " , i would say to the chancellor that the cost of wavering or looking like you are wavering or looking like you are weakening your resolve today because of what is happening in the markets - because of @entity253 and @entity254 and @entity255 and everything else - is very high indeed			1
' i think we have to give very strong signals here , and the chancellor , the prime minister and the deputy prime minister are all really quite intent in staying on course and staying on message			0
' this is very important , this is why the @entity170 adjustment programme cleared the markets , this is why you have very low borrowing costs , this is why i think you should persevere			2
' you are now sowing the seeds of what will be the elements for recovery			0
you have to have credible public finances before you start moving on growth			0
' mr @entity167 , will today meet mr @entity2 at a global investment conference at @entity168 ’s @entity183			1
he rejected suggestions that the chancellor ’s growth schemes had failed , saying : ' the programmes need time to produce results ... i think we should give it time			0
' and he dismissed speculation that the double - dip recession was putting the @entity170 ’s coveted @entity290 credit rating at risk : ' i do n’t think that ’s the case			0
references to that were not made by rating agencies			0
' i think what the rating agencies are looking for is consistency and coherence and that today is at a very big premium			0
' they are the first ones who will turn on you if they see you are not performing			0
” mr @entity167 agreed with mr @entity2 ’s analysis that @entity170 growth had been held back by the crisis in the eurozone			1
' if the neighbourhood is in such bad shape then predictably , because this is a large open economy which is dedicated to exporting , it will have an impact , ' he said			0
' you ca n’t be isolated , you ca n’t vaccinate yourself against the weakness of your major trading partners			0
' but @entity316 say he is wrong			0
@entity319 spokeswoman @entity318 said : ' it would be very unwise of @entity2 to take false comfort in the assurances of the head of the @entity162			1
his loyal support for the government today is the exact opposite of what his deputy has been saying for over a year and what the @entity329 said last week			0

@entity27 is the first @entity15 to speak out
@entity333 and @entity93 in the frame if @entity2 goes
*gay* *marriage* is *distracting* ministers from economy , another @entity15 claims
@entity1 admits gdp figures are ' very *disappointing* '
@entity22 fans row by admitted he *'d* be a good chancellor
@entity162 says mr @entity2 should ' persevere ' with austerity programme
