by @entity0 it was meant to reveal the ocean ’s deepest secrets , but a one - of - a - kind submersible vehicle now lies in a watery grave			2
the @entity7 ’ journey deep into the @entity8 to the north east of @entity10 ended when the robotic vehicle crumpled under the pressure of the water , just over 6 miles ( 10km ) below the waves			1
scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch			1
crushed dreams : the @entity7 ' journey deep into the @entity8 to the north east of @entity10 ended when the robotic vehicle ( pictured ) crumpled under the pressure of the water , just over 6 miles ( 10km ) below the waves its mission was to undertake high - risk , high - reward research in the deepest parts of the ocean , according to the @entity31 in @entity32 , which built and operated the multi million pound research vehicle			1
the institute 's chief scientist @entity34 , said : ' @entity7 helped us explore places we 've never seen before and ask questions we never thought to ask			0
’ ‘ it was a one - of - a - kind vehicle that even during its brief life , brought us amazing insights into the unexplored deep ocean , addressing some of the most fundamental scientific problems of our time about life on @entity46			1
’ researchers aboard an expedition ship called the @entity49 explained that they lost contact with their robot seven hours into a nine hour mission on saturday may 10			1
that sinking feeling : scientists believe that part of the vehicle imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it - as great as 16,000lbs per square inch			1
it was lost in the @entity8 ( pictured ) - one of the earth 's deepest oceanic trenches - to the north east of @entity10 ( pictured ) before the catastrophe , the robot had taken samples from the sea floor and samples of sea life			1
@entity73 , of the institute , said : ' we 'd just completed collecting a sea cucumber for the respirometer and were getting @entity7 ready to head to the underwater elevator			0
‘ then the camera feeds abruptly went dark , and we lost communication with the vehicle			0
’ the submersible , which was designed to operate autonomously as well as be controlled remotely by humans , was connected to the surface by a fibre - optic cable			0
it also had a system whereby it would gently float to the surface if the cable failed			0
however , the back - up could not be used and a member of the ship ’s crew saw white objects in the water			2
‘ the rescue boat went in and three crew members began scouring the surface with nets as more and more white dots appeared			0
@entity7 was gone , ’ mr @entity73 said			0
the submersible was lost 30 days into a 40 - day mission aboard the research ship , which was carrying out the first systematic study of a deep - ocean trench as part of the @entity110 ’s @entity109 ( hades ) project			1
the @entity8 ( illustrated ) runs northeast from the @entity113 of @entity10 to the @entity114			2
it is the second deepest oceanic trench in the world and formed by subduction - a geological process in which the tectonic plate is pushed beneath the @entity120 @entity7 had completed a number of deep and dangerous missions , including travelling to the @entity123 in the @entity124 , which is thought to be the deepest point in the ocean at over six miles ( 11km ) below the waves			1
since its launch in 2008 , it had also shed light on the world ’s deepest known thermal vents at @entity133 in the @entity134			0
@entity135 , the institute ’s director of research , said : ' extreme exploration of this kind is never without risk			0
' the unfortunate loss of @entity7 only underscores the difficulty of working at such immense depths and pressures			0
’ @entity7 brought back specimens of animals previously unknown to science on its first hades trip			2
it also collected seafloor sediment to help experts reveal the physical , chemical and biological processes that shape the deep - ocean ecosystems in ocean trenches , which are unlike almost any others on the planet			2
all aboard : @entity7 is hoisted back on board the research ship to see what treasures it had recovered on its hades cruise			1
it brought back specimens of animals previously unknown to science and seafloor sediment samples			0

the @entity7 imploded under the vast pressure of the water above it in the @entity8 to the north east of @entity10 , experts said
scientists aboard the @entity49 research ship explained they lost contact with their robot seven hours into a nine hour drive on saturday
it was designed by the @entity31 , @entity32 to undertake high - risk research in the deep ocean
the vehicle has previously *returned* species that have never been seen before and samples of the seafloor
