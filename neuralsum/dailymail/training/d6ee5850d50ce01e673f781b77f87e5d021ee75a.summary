with trust in @entity2 's politicians at its lowest ebb in decades , perhaps those in the corridors of power could take a leaf out of the man dubbed ' the poorest president in the world '			1
there is no chance of @entity13 leader @entity12 being caught fiddling his expenses or paying a clever account to avoid taxes - he barely claims a salary			1
the charismatic 77 - year - old has refused to adapt his lifestyle to embrace the trappings of power that come with being the country 's figurehead			1
@entity24 @entity13 president @entity12 has refused to adapt his lifestyle to match the trappings of wealth that come with being the country 's most powerful figure and he still lives on his farm turning down the invitation to live at a luxurious grace and favour residence owned by the state , he instead continues to reside at his ramshackle farm situated a few miles away from the country 's capital city of @entity37			1
the only sign the country 's leader is at home are the pair of police officers who stand guard at the end of his heavily tractor - rutted dirt track			1
mr @entity12 gives 90 per cent of his monthly salary , the equivalent of £ 7,500 , away to charity leaving him with just £ 485 a month to live off			1
the part - time farmer 's proudest and most valuable possessions are his tired - looking @entity52 and his three - legged dog @entity54			1
water comes from a well which is surrounded by overgrown weeds and the laundry goes not in a tumble dryer but on the washing line outside			0
mr @entity12 on his farm with his three - legged dog @entity54 the president 's austere lifestyle is a world away from that of many politicians in the @entity2 who have been caught out trying to unethically and in some cases illegally boost their incomes by fiddling their expenses			1
it may be three years since the expenses scandal broke , but the fallout continues			2
just this week former @entity75 mp @entity74 was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £ 53,000 to which she was not entitled			1
she evaded a jail sentence because and has not received a criminal record because she was deemed unfit to stand trial because of depression and so the jury could not find her guilty of any crime			0
her false claims are so far the largest discovered in the expenses scandal , ahead of the £ 30,000 which former labour minister @entity86 was found guilty of claiming and sent to jail for last year			2
but mr @entity88 , a former left - wing revolutionary , says he has no interest in amassing a fortune			2
he says he has all he needs and that material wealth does not buy happiness			0
speaking to the @entity93 he said : ' i 'm called ' the poorest president ' , but i do n't feel poor			2
poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle , and always want more and more , ' he says			0
' this is a matter of freedom			0
if you do n't have many possessions then you do n't need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them , and therefore you have more time for yourself , ' he says			0
' i may appear to be an eccentric old man ... but this is a free choice			0
' in contrast to many western politicians who aim to amass property empires , mr @entity12 last year declared his total assets at just £ 135,000			2
elected in 2009 , he spent the 1960s and 1970s as part of the @entity13 guerrilla @entity114 , a leftist armed group inspired by the @entity118 revolution			1
different outlook : ' i 'm called ' the poorest president ' , he says , ' but i do n't feel poor			0
poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle , and always want more and more ' mr @entity12 gives 90 per cent of his monthly salary , the equivalent of £ 7,500 away to charity , leaving him with just £ 485 a month to live off just this week former @entity75 mp @entity74 ( left ) was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £ 53,000 to which she was not entitled he was shot six times and spent 14 years in jail , most of which was spent in tough conditions and isolation			1
he was only freed in 1985 when @entity13 returned to democracy			2
the altruistic leader used the @entity137 conference in june this year to promote his anti-capitalist message to the world			0
he said : ' we 've been talking all afternoon about sustainable development			0
to get the masses out of poverty			0
' but what are we thinking ? do we want the model of development and consumption of the rich countries ? i ask you now : what would happen to this planet if @entity153 would have the same proportion of cars per household than @entity157 ? how much oxygen would we have left ? ' does this planet have enough resources so seven or eight billion can have the same level of consumption and waste that today is seen in rich societies ? it is this level of hyper - consumption that is harming our planet			0
' although he came to power with a landslide victory , his popularity has waned slightly of late after two controversial moves			0
in the limelight : mr @entity12 in his role as leader of the ruling @entity174 , gestures to supporters during his closing campaign act in 2009 firstly , unlike the previous president he refused to veto a parliamentary bill which legalised abortions for pregnancies up to 12 weeks			1
secondly he has agreed to a debate about legalising cannabis which has riled some sections of society			0
yet the president will not be too worried as @entity13 law means he is unable to stand for re-election in 2014 , leaving him able to comfortably slip back into his simple life on the farm .			1
