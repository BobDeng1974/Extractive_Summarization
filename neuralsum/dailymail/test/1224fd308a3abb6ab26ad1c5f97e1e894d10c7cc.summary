@entity0 have already met @entity1 to assess him for the manager ’s job – but it was back in 2013 when they were seeking a replacement for @entity6			1
@entity7 , @entity0 ’s director of football met the @entity9 manager and concluded that he was not the right fit for @entity0 – and the club went on to appoint @entity12			1
@entity7 ’s meeting and rejection of @entity1 back in 2013 adds weight to the growing evidence that @entity1 will not get the @entity0 job even though the @entity9 manager quit this week , fuelling a wave of speculation about which @entity21 clubs might want to appoint him this summer			1
@entity0 have already met @entity1 to assess him for the manager ’s job – but it was back in 2013 the @entity9 boss will leave the club at the end of this season , with suggestions he could take over at @entity0 @entity12 ’s position is clearly vulnerable given @entity0 ’s failures this year on all fronts – in the @entity33 , which was the principal target , the @entity21 and the domestic cups			1
however , there is an insistence at the club that it should be not be automatically assumed that @entity12 will be dismissed as , unlike when @entity6 went , the club is running smoothly off the pitch without the internal tensions and disagreements which characterised @entity6 ’s last days			2
there will be the usual end - of - season review of the manager ’s performance but this would take place every season , whatever success or not had been achieved			2
@entity12 will clearly have to answer difficult questions about the team ’s under performance , especially as they have sunk to fourth place and run the risk of being overhauled by @entity57 for the @entity33			0
however , @entity7 would also expect to answer questions about the recruitment of players last summer such as @entity61 for £ 35million and @entity62 for £ 13m , neither of whom has made an impact			0
on the plus side for @entity12 , his style of play is seen as compatible with the type of club @entity70 and his colleague , chief executive @entity71 , are attempting to create			0
@entity0 opted for @entity12 after holding talks with both the @entity74 and @entity1 two years ago @entity6 left the @entity75 in 2013 after failing to defend his @entity21 crown director of football @entity7 will have questions to answer after signing @entity61 ( left ) both are former executives at @entity80 , where possession football and a strong academy were integral to the @entity84 club and are now central to their vision @entity0			1
@entity1 ’s counter attacking football does not fit their philosophy and there was also a sense that his exuberant personality would not be the type of manager for which @entity0 were looking in 2013			2
however , despite the club ’s reassurances about @entity12 , it is clear that his position will be under threat if not this summer then certainly next year , when @entity101 ’s three - year deal with @entity102 runs out			0
if @entity0 do decide to make the change this summer , @entity103 will be avaible when he leaves @entity105 , where is challenging for a @entity33 place , the @entity107 and the @entity108 , and would be a strong candidate			0
but @entity101 clearly remains the favourite to take over when he has finished at @entity102			0
begiristain was central in @entity101 ’s appointment to @entity80 in 2008 , a move which was considered a huge risk at the time but which paid extraordinary dividends as @entity80 won two @entity33 trophies , three @entity119 titles and the @entity120 twice under @entity101			0
@entity7 ’s faith in @entity101 when his only previous experience was with the @entity124 team is why @entity125 , @entity0 ’s academy manager , has become a contender to take over should @entity12 leave .			1

@entity12 *'s* job at @entity0 is *precarious*
the @entity21 champions have struggled this season
@entity0 met with @entity1 two years ago but opted for @entity12
the @entity9 manager will leave the club at the end of this campaign
