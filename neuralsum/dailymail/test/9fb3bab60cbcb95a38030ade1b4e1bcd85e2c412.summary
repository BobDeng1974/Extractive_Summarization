@entity0 is under pressure to axe 200 stores — on top of 100 already closed or cancelled — after the supermarket giant announced a record annual loss of £ 6.38billion			1
the loss is the largest ever declared by a @entity8 retailer and reflects a seismic shift in shopping habits away from big supermarkets towards smaller budget stores			1
over the past 20 years , @entity0 went on a spending spree to build up a vast land bank that was designed to expand its empire of some 3,000 stores			1
as a result , @entity0 has been forced to slash the value of its property empire and sell off land cheaply , with the loss of thousands of jobs			1
@entity8 ’s biggest retailer made a profit of £ 1.4billion on sales through the tills across the world in the year to the end of february , down by 60 per cent on the year before			1
this profit was more than wiped out by £ 7billion worth of one - off costs , led by a write - down of £ 4.3billion on the value of its land and stores			1
there was also a write - down of some £ 570 million on the food and other products sitting in its warehouses and stores , while the company has agreed to pump an extra £ 270million a year into its staff pension scheme , which has a deficit of £ 3.9billion			1
the closure of more than 45 stores and its current head office in @entity53 will cost more than £ 400million			1
the firm is also cutting back on future expansion , with the cancellation of more than 50 ‘ big box ’ stores			2
the loss of £ 6.38 billion — the biggest in the supermarket ’s 96 - year history — was even worse than the most pessimistic @entity63 analysts had expected			1
shares in @entity0 closed down 5.2 per cent on the day , wiping around £ 1billion off its stock market value and taking it down to just over £ 18billion			1
here , retail industry veterans , plus @entity69 writers , identify what on earth went wrong			1
the experts @entity73 , retail consultant the problem with @entity0 is that no one really likes the company			1
consumers either want pure value , or want to be looked after and put first as customers			0
@entity0 did n’t do either			1
today , people want brands they trust , and the truth is @entity0 acted in a bullish way – they built where they wanted , when they wanted , they did n’t care about the effect on communities			1
and now people are turning their backs on them			0
image problem : @entity73 says the problem with @entity0 ' is that no one really likes the company ' sir @entity93 , former chief executive of @entity94 when i ran @entity94 we looked at having a private jet for the board			1
i deemed it too expensive , even when we were making a billion pounds a year			0
@entity0 having four private jets tells you something about the culture of the place			1
it has also tried to do far too much			0
it tried conquering the @entity105 , then @entity106			0
but to try to go into @entity107 at the same time was a very , very bad idea			0
you can not conquer the world overnight			0
@entity111 , author of @entity112 : the shocking power of @entity8 supermarkets i ’m no fan of supermarkets in general , but @entity0 is at the absolute bottom of my list			1
@entity123 , when we believed @entity0 was good value and trusted the brand , we tolerated — up to a point — how five or six stores bullied their way into our communities			1
but the arrival of @entity129 and @entity130 made us realise that the ‘ @entity132 ’ supermarkets have been charging us way too much — earning extreme margins and profiteering at our expense			0
' too much ' : former @entity94 chief executive sir @entity93 blames @entity0 's grand expansion plans lord @entity136 , former chairman of @entity137 @entity0 ’s problem is that it tried to be all things to all men			1
it has vast stores that want to be an @entity94 and a @entity130 all in one			2
@entity142 concentrates on the cheap - and - cheerful market , while @entity144 still targets the top end of the market , and both are successful for keeping it more simple			2
@entity149 , former boss of @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 @entity0 must be clear on pricing — it needs to stop the offers and promotions			1
if @entity157 charges £ 1 for a cleaner , so should @entity0			1
people want great value but consistency , too			0
@entity0 also needs to rationalise the options of products — its stores have way too many product lines and categories			1
@entity167 , ran the now defunct @entity168 which supplied @entity0 @entity0 ’s problem was that it kept screwing over its suppliers			1
it demanded a wave of charges for things like new label systems or the introduction of new technology			0
these charges to suppliers became more and more unreasonable , and in the end the company ruined its base			0
mail writers @entity183 i ’ve always defended @entity0 to my middle - class friends			1
remember , i ’d say , not everyone can afford to buy their groceries at @entity144			0
but even i , a stubborn @entity0 shopper , have fallen out of love with the store over the past couple of years			1
besides its self - pay tills seemingly never working and its @entity195 range not being as fine as it used to be , its online delivery service is rubbish			2
over the years , i ’ve flirted with all the supermarket delivery services , but , in the end , i settled for @entity0 because it always had the best offers on quality dishwasher tablets — and lots of convenient evening delivery slots			1
however , last year i switched to @entity204 ’s			0
there were four reasons i abandoned @entity0 : rude delivery drivers who were often late ; a slew of items substituted for ones i ’d ordered ; too many annoying flash sales ( although @entity211 is guilty of this , too ) ; and one rotten tomato too many			1
abandoned : @entity183 ( left ) said one rotten tomato too many made her turn her back on @entity0 after years as a loyal customer , while @entity216 ( right ) said a trip to @entity0 became a ' sweaty , irritating chore ' @entity216 for me , it was the sense of contempt			1
we had a local @entity0 we used , in the absence of any good , big supermarkets in a rural area , and it was ok			1
nothing special , but handy for things the smaller shops might not stock and for bulk buys			0
but a few years ago it increased the ‘ homewares ’ section and the children ’s clothes , in roughly the same overall space			0
the aisles got narrower , the layout was confusing and the staff on the floor were fewer and surlier			0
it became a sweaty , irritating chore to shop there			0
meanwhile , the co-op improved and then came a @entity144 , all smiley and willing and smart and not more expensive for basics			0
end of ! @entity246 , city editor at the heart of the problems for @entity0 ’s new boss , @entity249 , has been some wildly over-optimistic accounting			2
under his predecessor , @entity252 , the books essentially were cooked to make profits look stronger and debts look less than was truthfully the case			0
over the past year or so , @entity8 ’s biggest grocer inflated its profits in the @entity8 and @entity260 by as much as £ 326 million , by recording incentive payments from big suppliers that had not actually arrived , while failing to record the costs of some sales			1
@entity267 , the arrival of a new boss often signals a ‘ kitchen sink job ’ under which all the bad announcements are made to the stock exchange in one go to signal the start of a better era			0
in this case , it has resulted in a £ 6.4 billion loss			2
disloyal : @entity278 says it is the lack of brand loyalty which really harmed @entity0 @entity281 @entity0 ’s problem is that it ’s forgotten who its customers are			2
its founder @entity286 ’s philosophy was simple : ‘ pile ’ em high , sell ’ em cheap			0
’ you did n’t go to @entity0 because you liked the service or aspired to throwing a classier dinner party			2
you went because it was the best value for money			0
today that ’s no longer the case			0
not only are @entity204 ’s meat and its @entity297 range better quality than the @entity0 equivalents , but they ’re cheaper , too			2
as an experiment yesterday , i did a basic shop of veg , fruit , bacon , chicken , detergent , cat food , bread , fizzy water and a bottle of @entity312 at both supermarkets			2
@entity204 ’s came out £ 2 cheaper — and you ’d save even more if you went to @entity314 , @entity142 , @entity129 or @entity130			2
@entity278 @entity0 thought that ubiquity was everything			2
there was never enough staff in their thousands of stores , yet they kept opening more , sometimes even in competition with each other			0
however , i believe @entity0 ’s fatal mistake was believing that consumers loved it for what it was			2
in fact , its core customers were interested only in the price			0
when the same or similar goods were cheaper elsewhere , they left in droves			0
there was no brand loyalty , especially when everyone else started doing online delivery , too			0
@entity337 ultimately @entity0 has failed because it put quantity before quality			2
its mantra was ‘ be big ’ ; it wanted to dominate and did not care enough about where it sourced food or that customers ’ tastes would change , particularly in a recession			0
@entity0 came off worst in the horse meat scandal because its staff did not ask the right questions when they bought the cheapest meat — and shoppers were repelled by the outcome			2
there is also a sense the stores do not excel at anything in particular			0
just being ‘ big ’ is not a lasting philosophy .			0

@entity0 announced a record annual loss of £ 6.38billion yesterday
