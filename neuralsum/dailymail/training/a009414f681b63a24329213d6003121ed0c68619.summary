by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:55 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 4 january 2013 army chiefs have made an extraordinary appeal to dozens of former paratroopers at the centre of the @entity8 controversy to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation by police in @entity13			0
the move has sparked a bitter backlash from some @entity17 veterans who fear that the identities will become known of those involved on the streets of @entity20 in 1972 when 14 people died			1
the identities of the soldiers – some now in their 60s and 70s – have been protected by successive inquiries over four decades			1
forty - year controversy : soldiers arrest a man on @entity8			1
army chiefs have appealed to paratroopers involved to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation police say the new and complex inquiry is expected to last four years and could lead to criminal prosecutions of veteran paratroopers			1
last night one former paratrooper , who was on duty on @entity8 , said : ‘ this has caused considerable anger and the implications are huge			0
‘ even 40 years on some of us are authorised to carry personal protection weapons because of the obvious threat to our lives and those of our families			2
‘ we see this as a clear warning that the identities of those soldiers doing their duty that day in appalling circumstances and under attack on the streets of @entity58 are in real danger of leaking out with obvious consequences			1
‘ the @entity61 is clearly not in a position to guarantee our anonymity so many will be reluctant to co-operate , making the police inquiry something of a farce			2
’ the identities of the soldiers working on @entity8 have been protected by successive inquiries over four decades a letter from @entity72 , of the directorate of judicial engagement policy at the @entity61 , is being sent to regimental associations asking for those involved during @entity8 to contact the ministry			1
it has been sanctioned by the @entity17 ’s colonel commandant , lieutenant general @entity79			0
the letter contains the warning : ‘ we feel it is only fair to let witnesses know that we may be required to disclose those details to the police at some stage			0
’ and to the concern of veteran @entity17 , there is no reassurance that identities will be protected			1
the letter only says : ‘ we are aware that a number of witnesses to the @entity95 were granted anonymity and may be concerned whether the police investigation will affect that			0
fourteen people died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in january 1972 ‘ we understand those concerns and will be raising this with the @entity106 so they can take this into account when planning their inquiry			2
’ last month police commanders briefed relatives of the 14 who died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in january 1972 that a new investigation would be launched			0
it came after they and prosecutors reviewed the findings of the @entity121 public inquiry			2
following a 12 - year inquiry costing £ 195million , @entity122 found that the killings were unjustified and that none of the dead posed a threat when they were shot			1
that contradicted the long - standing official version of events , outlined in the 1972 @entity133 report , which had exonerated the soldiers			1
the @entity121 inquiry prompted @entity136 to apologise to the relatives			2
following a 12 year inquiry , @entity122 found that the killings were unjustified and that none of the dead posed a threat when they were shot crucially , statements given by witnesses , who were only identified by a letter , to the @entity121 inquiry can not be used as evidence in criminal proceedings			1
the letter stresses : ‘ the purpose of this letter is to reassure you of the @entity61 ’s policy to support its people , whether serving or veterans , in circumstances when their actions , conducted in good faith whilst on operations , come under judicial scrutiny			0
’ but another former paratrooper , who served in the regiment in 1972 , added : ‘ we now have known terrorists in our @entity161 and we do n’t know who to trust			0
the authorities will not be getting my address and that is for sure			0
’ last night the @entity61 said : ‘ we may be obliged to provide the @entity106 with details of former soldiers			0
we will take great care to identify the names that are subject to an anonymity order clearly so that they continue to be protected			0

move sparked a backlash from those who fear identities will be revealed
the identities of the soldiers have been protected by inquiries for years
following a 12 - year inquiry , @entity122 found killings were unjustified
