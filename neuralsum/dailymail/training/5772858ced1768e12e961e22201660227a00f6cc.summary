but today @entity31 , which also transmits to @entity35 , said it was removing the pictures from its archive after discovering they were faked			0

' the @entity31 informed @entity1 officials of its decision regarding the photos , but there was no public reaction or comment			1

unaltered : the image how it should look showing @entity61 's president @entity60 , left , with @entity1 leader @entity3 , right , and @entity3 's wife @entity63 during a private meeting in @entity21 @entity31 is deleting the images from its archive because doctored images are against its policy the news agency 's policy is to use handout photographs only when there is no other option , and to scrutinize them carefully for possible manipulation			1
it was during such screening that photo editors noted an anomaly in a picture that showed @entity3 meeting with @entity81 president @entity80 in @entity21 on january 29			2

the @entity31 did not transmit the @entity80 photograph or any official photos of @entity3 handed out subsequent to it to customers			1
but a review of other handout images , including a photograph of @entity3 meeting with @entity61 president @entity60 , showed similar signs of manipulation			0
the photo was transmitted by the @entity31 , as well as by other news organizations			0
