by @entity0 it is great news for those in their thirties and forties worried life is over			0
researchers say that in fact , our personalities develop until well into our fifities			0
they say our personality becomes most stable during middle age - but then begins to decline again			2
researchers say our personalities develop into our fifties - and that middle age in peak time for them			1
researchers in @entity18 recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice , with a gap of two years in between			0
the survey measured a person 's honesty - humility factor as well as five major personality traits : extraversion , agreeableness , conscientiousness , neuroticism and openness to experience			1
they compared how people 's scores varied between years , and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another , depending on age			0
experts found that the stability of personality increases through youth , peaks in mid-life and then gradually reduces again into old age , presumably in response to the variations in social and biological pressures we experience at the different stages of life			2

most people 's personalities were generally stable , they found , but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time , peaking at middle - age and then dropping again			1
for certain traits â€” conscientiousness , openness to experience , and honesty - humility , the oldest participants ' personality stability matched those of the youngest			1
@entity83 was the most stable trait , and agreeableness the least , according to the @entity86 's @entity85			2
people in their 30s , for example , showed high levels of neuroticism , but by the time they reached their 50s that had been replaced by conscientiousness , openness and honesty - humility			1
people in their 30s , for example , showed high levels of neuroticism , but by the time they reached their 50s that had been replaced by conscientiousness , openness and honesty - humility			1
the researchers said these " domain specific " variations in personality stability point to different environmental and social demands influencing different personality traits to varying degrees at slightly different times of life			0
" this report further highlights the need to test ... the effects of events that might cause the lower stability [ of personality ] in younger and older adulthood , " the researchers said			0
" in addition our finding of systematically different peaks in stability between different personality dimensions suggest the need to further investigate age - specific changes in environmental and social pressures that are associated with such domain - specific effects			2

@entity83 and neuroticism showed highest stability in the late 30s
openness , honesty - humility , and conscientiousness showed peak stability in the late *40s*
