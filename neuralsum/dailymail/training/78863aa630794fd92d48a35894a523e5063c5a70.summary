by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 were among the rich assortment of players to make fulsome contributions to a wonderful first day at the 114th @entity7 before @entity8 emerged from the evening shadows to add a slice of @entity12 history on thursday			1
a remarkably crowded leaderboard led by @entity2 among others had formed until the brilliant @entity15 put together an intoxicating back nine that earned him a clear three stroke lead			1
on the charge : @entity8 stormed into a three - shot lead after a brilliant back nine @entity8 completed a spectacular return from a year in the wilderness with his victory in the @entity24 last month			1
here the good times continued with a stunning inward half of 31 strokes for a 65 that was the lowest score ever seen in nine @entity29 rounds at this storied @entity31 venue			1
‘ obviously i took a lot of confidence from the @entity35 victory and especially the way i won down the stretch , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ i played very well today and holed some good putts late on that made my score			2
’ @entity41 once sat in the locker room at a @entity29 and , shaking his head , proclaimed : ‘ i just played with a kid who should have beaten me by six shots			1
’ early running : @entity2 ( left ) gets praise from @entity47 on the 18th green certain parallels with that lovely story about a tender @entity51 might well have crossed @entity53 ’s mind on thursday after being outplayed by @entity55 ’s outstanding young talent @entity1 in the opening round of the 114th edition			1
in the end , the decorated @entity63 shot 70 to the @entity66 teenager ’s 71 , but the third member of the group , defending champion @entity67 , who fought back valiantly for a 72 of his own , called it perfectly , saying : ‘ @entity1 was just so impressive , he played an outstanding round of golf			1
the only disappointing thing for him is that he must feel he left several shots out there			2
’ close up : @entity53 , right , and @entity1 on the eighth hole the most disappointing of those came at his penultimate hole , the 8th on the card , when he addressed a chip and his ball moved			2
@entity76 duly called in the referee to confirm he needed to add a one shot penalty			1
typical @entity1 , he did n’t bemoan his luck afterwards or rage at the gods			2
‘ i just thought : “ oops ” , ’ said the 19 year old			0
day one at the most eagerly anticipated @entity29 for some years and the hoopla was justified as @entity2 supplied the grit , @entity47 the glamour , and some of the outstanding young talents in the game showed their quality and composure			1
@entity29 specialist @entity2 was the early leader alongside @entity63 @entity89 after respective rounds of 68 but @entity91 , the remarkable 20 - year - old @entity92 , and @entity94 ’s 22 - year - old rising son @entity93 also broke par with 69s , as did world no 2 @entity98 and world no 5 @entity97			1
@entity47 played quite beautifully , hitting 14 greens in regulation and missing just one fairway , but still finished three shots behind playing partner , @entity106 - @entity105 is there another player in the sport who manages his game quite as expertly as @entity2 , who won this title in 2010 and finished runner - up in 2012 ? tough challenge : @entity115 hits out of the trees on the eighth hole by his own admission he did n’t strike the ball very well but the only time he was ever out of position was on the closing hole , and he still made a @entity123 birdied it to place his round in a deservedly kinder light			1
another contented camper was @entity128 , who matched the stringent par of 70			1
three more 70s , and he will almost certainly be collecting his first major come sunday night			0
just why @entity76 will turn pro after this tournament was evident in this exciting display			1
he will need to find a little length off the tee but other than that the only missing piece is experience			1
he gave himself any number of birdie opportunities while a couple of the saves he made from precarious spots were so good they were positively mickelson-esque			0
and so it was that a shade before 8am the most alluring threeball of the day made their way to the first tee			0
you had to admire @entity76 ’s composure as he walked down his first hole			1
fitting : @entity154 wearing plus fours in tribute to late @entity157 a decent number of his supporters were making themselves known and @entity55 ’s first @entity161 for more than a century acknowledged them all			0
at the masters there had been first tee nerves and a double bogey			0
here he calmly pitched close to the hole and rolled the putt in for a birdie			0
another followed at the 12th and he actually stood over a 6ft birdie putt at the 13th for the outright lead			2
it caught the hole , alas , and stayed out			0
when he missed short putts at the next two as well for bogeys , there was the horrible fear his dream start was turning into nightmarish reality			0
then came a welcome moment of good fortune as a long birdie putt at the 16th touched every millimetre of the hole ’s circumference before falling below ground			0
@entity76 looked skywards and expressed his relief by blowing out his cheeks and smiling broadly			1
by the side of the green , @entity53 caught his eye and acknowledged the quality of the putt			0
testing : @entity197 hits a shot from a bunker on the sixth hole ‘ he was like that all day as was @entity67 , ’ said @entity76			1
‘ whenever i played a good shot they made sure i heard what they thought about it			2
it was a great experience for me			0
i know my game is currently a long way from theirs , they ’re grown men who have won majors			0
but i hope to get there one day			0
’ outside the ropes , the masses were getting excited as @entity53 showed all his class and short game brilliance to move into the lead at one point , as he attempts to complete the fabled career grand slam			2
it was some effort by the @entity7 champion who will turn 44 next monday , given the mental burden of his past history in this event , where he has been runner - up on no fewer than six occasions			2
two dropped shots late on , however , tinged the round with feelings of disappointment			0
@entity53 had woken to a story in the @entity234 admitting they had ‘ overstated ’ the claim he was being investigated for potential insider trading			0
‘ as i ’ve said all along , i did nothing wrong but i ’ll continue to help the investigation in any way that i can , ’ he said			0
scenic : @entity242 hits his tee shot on the 15th hole during the first round as for @entity246 , just as he did last year when he went on to win , he fought back from a horrible start that saw him reach the turn in four over par. ‘ i was definitely thinking about @entity250 after nine holes , ’ he acknowledged			1
‘ my short game was really poor but if i can get that sharp i can really feel confident about the rest of the week because i ’m striking the ball better than i have for a while			0
’ a crowded leaderboard , therefore , and a gorgeous mix of established figures and men of promise who will undoubtedly leave their mark on the game in years to come			0
@entity12 is living up to the hype			0
composure : @entity53 recovered from shaky start to card a first - round 70			2

@entity66 *'s* @entity76 *briefly* held a share of the lead after starting with two birdies in his first three holes
@entity47 shot 71 despite hitting 14 greens in regulation and missing just one fairway
@entity29 specialist @entity2 was among early front - runners on 68
@entity8 claimed a three - shot lead after carding a five - under - par 65
