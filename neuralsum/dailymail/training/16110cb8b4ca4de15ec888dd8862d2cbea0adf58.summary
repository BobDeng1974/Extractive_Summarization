by @entity0 the @entity2 quango chief blamed by flood victims for wrecking homes and livelihoods has effectively been told to quit by @entity6			0
communities secretary @entity7 , now put in charge of handling the flooding crisis by @entity10 , said @entity12 chairman @entity11 should make a public apology for its mistakes			1
and asked whether @entity11 , a former cabinet minister , should resign , mr @entity7 said bluntly : ‘ he has to make his own decision			1
’ brutal : new floods chief @entity7 , left , castigated @entity12 chairman @entity11 , pictured right with his @entity17 terrier @entity16 he used brutal sarcasm to pile on the pressure , adding : ‘ i do n’t see myself becoming the advocate of the “ save @entity11 ” campaign or printing “ @entity24 ” t - shirts			1
’ he accused @entity11 of playing ‘ divide and rule ’ by ‘ trying to set town against country ’ , letting the @entity12 become ‘ riddled with politically correct ’ eco-fanatics opposed to dredging , presiding as the organisation ‘ lost its way ’ and spending 20 times more money on its bloated bureaucracy than on keeping rivers clear			1
mr @entity7 ’s comments came 24 hours after lord @entity11 visited the flood - hit @entity36 and refused to resign			1
the minister showed little sympathy over the mauling local residents gave lord @entity11 , who lives in a £ 1 million @entity42 apartment with beloved @entity17 terrier @entity16			1
‘ it ’s always good to get feedback from your customers , ’ mr @entity7 observed drily			2
‘ at least he ’ll never have to hire a focus group to know what people are thinking			0
’ ignoring @entity2 claims that the government is ‘ scapegoating ’ lord @entity11 , mr @entity7 urged him to give in to demands to say sorry for the @entity12 ’s alleged failings			1
‘ it ’s not a sign of weakness			0
a bit of reaching out and humanity and humility is good for everybody , whether a distinguished quangocrat or a member of the @entity63			0
’ condemned : mr @entity7 ' comments came 24 hours after lord @entity11 visited the flood - hit @entity36 and refused to resign mr @entity7 added : ‘ being flooded is like a burglary : afterwards , the effect continues			1
it ’s not just the drying out or loss of precious possessions and memories			0
every time it rains people wonder , “ is it going to happen again ? ” ’ mr @entity7 was asked by mr @entity10 to take charge of the crisis last week after environment secretary @entity77 had to have urgent treatment for a detached retina			1
mr @entity77 , who is married to an aristocrat ’s daughter , had been criticised for visiting the @entity36 in town shoes , not @entity84 boots			2
he was accused of seeming ‘ shrill and aloof ’ in interviews and in dealing with flood victims			1
by contrast , plain - talking @entity87 mr @entity7 was born into a @entity2 - supporting family and has the common touch you would expect of an @entity93 mp			0
mr @entity7 said the @entity12 had blundered by stopping dredging			1
‘ the @entity36 were man - made and dredging was a fundamental part of keeping it going , just as it is with any land below sea level right across the world			0
you need to continuously dredge			0
‘ it worries me that in a politically correct attempt to be more environmentally sound than the next person , something as basic as this has been forgotten			2
’ no one has ever accused @entity7 of being a slave to political – or any other – fashion			1
by contrast , culture vulture @entity11 was a new labour minister who cut his teeth in trendy , @entity2 - run @entity114 , the urban fount of political correctness			1
‘ @entity11 tried to play divide and rule by setting town against country [ when he said that the @entity12 had to protect one or the other ]			1
that is a false choice			0
‘ the people on the ground have done a fantastic job , but the agency has lost its way and become riddled with political correctness			1
@entity7 said the people on the ground had done a fantastic job but the agency had become ' riddled with political correctness ' it is not the first time he has clashed with the @entity12 ’s eco warriors			1
‘ do n’t even start me on my arguments with them about fortnightly rubbish collections , ’ he roared			2
the flood has submerged the homes and lives of thousands of people			0
and if mr @entity7 has his way , the @entity143 will join the casualty list			0
he plans to force town halls to spell out on council tax bills how much money each household is contributing to the @entity12 ’s eye - watering £ 1.2 billion annual budget			1
he said : ‘ the @entity12 hiked up the council tax by around 20 per cent in the @entity153 last year with little to show for it			1
‘ he added : ‘ it must not be invisible any more			0
they need a clear leadership and to understand that people matter			0
people are entitled to feel safe in their homes			0
‘ the @entity12 gets £ 1.2 billion a year but paid out £ 395 million on staff last year and just £ 20 million on improving maintenance of culverts and channels to ensure the free flow of water			1
’ it was the most expensive agency of its type in @entity168 , costing nearly as much as in the @entity169			2
mr @entity7 had no truck with green activists who say people on the @entity36 chose to live below sea level and should move			0
@entity12 chief lord @entity11 discusses the water level where the @entity176 and @entity177 meet near @entity178 , @entity36 ‘ that ’s bad news for most of the @entity181 is n’t it ? ’ he quipped , with trademark deadpan humour			1
‘ i am certainly not in retreat			0
i want people back in their homes and animals back in their farms			0
’ mr @entity7 said he was determined to restore train links to @entity190 after the track crumbled into the sea in @entity193 in @entity194			2
but he does not rule out re-routing the track inland in the future			2
and he plans a massive ‘ storm audit ’ of all coastal road and rail links to find out whether other changes are needed			2
‘ we will look at all our strategic infrastructure to ensure it is as clear as possible from disruption from storms			0
’ he is due to visit areas hit by the floods in a few days			2
when he does , unlike mr @entity77 , he will definitely be wearing @entity208			0
are they black or green ? ‘ @entity210 , of course , ’ laughed mr @entity7			2
@entity212 are for the posh kids , like @entity214 and @entity10 .			0
