by @entity0 and @entity1 a detailed picture of how ‘ mr and mrs average ’ live has been built up using data from @entity7			1
the study shows how men and women develop new interests as they mature – and how the genders are often out of sync			1
while women tend to take exercise seriously from the age of 34 , for example , the average man waits until his 45th birthday before working hard to get in shape			2
the average woman spends more time talking about sports , politics , career and money as she gets older women ’s interest in books peaks aged 22 , while men become most into literature as they reach their 50s			2
and men start to shift their focus away from the workplace after age 30 , while women do not do so until eight years later			2
both sexes , however , care most about fashion aged 16			1
the research used anonymous data donated by thousands of @entity7 users , recording the statuses , ‘ likes ’ and ‘ interests ’ they had posted on their profiles			1
it found the average woman talks about television most at 44 , while men peak much younger , aged 31			2
men are also most likely to see a film in a cinema at 31 – but women go out to see films most aged only 19			2
men are most interested in travel at 29 , women at 27 , while women talk most about food and drink at 35 , and men at 38			1
and if you are middle aged , a fail - safe topic for any audience is the weather – a key interest for many as they approach 60			2
@entity69 , the @entity70 scientist who carried out the research , also created the @entity73 search engine used by @entity74 and @entity75			2
he recently said : ‘ it ’s almost shocking how much this tells us about the evolution of people ’s typical interests			1
‘ people talk less about video games as they get older , and more about politics			2
the @entity7 study found women are most interested in fitness aged 34 while for men they are aged 45 ‘ men typically talk more about sports and technology than women – and , somewhat surprisingly to me , they also talk more about movies , television and music			1
’ experts say tracking such details could mean social change is spotted sooner			0
@entity100 , of think - tank demos , said such monitoring if done in ‘ real time ’ could also detect changes in the public mood			0
he added : ‘ you could produce a social media version of the “ worm ” that ran alongside speeches [ on tv screens ] in the leaders ’ debates during the last general election , but relying on millions of voices			0
’ but it may alarm others who feel we are already monitored too much online , for example with ‘ cookies ’ tracking browsing and tailoring online adverts to our tastes			0
tracking key words that users post on their @entity7 walls , a picture is being created of what interests people depending on age and gender			1
mr @entity69 said in his blog : ' some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical			0
' and most of it is n’t terribly surprising to anyone who ’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages			1
the age of men and women when their interest peaks on @entity7 books : men - 50 women - 22 fashion : men - 16 women - 16 fitness : men - 45 women - 34 health : men - 54 women - 43 tech : men - 34 women - 22 sports : men - 14 and 18 women - 48 ' but what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail [ and through data analysis create ] a kind of a signature of people ’s thinking as they go through life			1
' the study revealed that people talk more about politics as they get older and are generally more interested in family and friends when in their early teens			1
but not all subjects split the genders			0
men and women 's interest in politics and weather both peak at 60 - the age where the study ends			1
there is only a six year gap on the subject of pets and animals where women 's interest peaks on @entity7 aged 37 and men aged 43			1
@entity100 , from the think tank @entity192 , said the live tracking used in this study could be used on a wider scale - from politics to exercise			1
the different ages men and women are most interested in books is the biggest gender gap - 28 years mr @entity69 was also optimistic about what could be achieved using these methods of live tracking and data science			1
he said on his blog : ' over the decades i ’ve been steadily accumulating countless anecdotal “ case studies ” about the trajectories of people ’s lives — from which i ’ve certainly noticed lots of general patterns			0
' but what ’s amazed me about what we ’ve done over the past few weeks is how much systematic information it ’s been possible to get all at once			0
quite what it all means , and what kind of general theories we can construct from it , i do n’t yet know			0
' but it feels like we ’re starting to be able to train a serious “ computational telescope ” on the “ social universe ”			0
' and it ’s letting us discover all sorts of phenomena			0
that have the potential to help us understand much more about society and about ourselves			0
' and that , by the way , provide great examples of what can be achieved with data science , and with the technology i ’ve been working on developing for so long			0
' one in eight social media users make up things to tweet or put on @entity7 one in eight social media addicts make up things to put on their tweets and status updates , new figures reveal			1
and it is because they want to keep up with the star - studded lifestyle of the rich and famous from @entity251 to @entity252 it seems			0
most reckon their own lives are too humdrum so exaggerate , fib and cheat to make themselves sound more interesting , said the study by @entity258			1
the survey of 2,000 social media users found 12 per cent of social media users regularly ' big up ' what 's happening in their lives to sound more interesting			2
many are so determined to be on a social media site that they will be economical with the truth when nothing interesting is going on in their lives or they can not think of something funny to say			0
four in 10 ( 39 per cent ) of social network fibbers put their dishonesty down to pressure from friends and colleagues to have a good time or sound upbeat in their @entity7 or @entity279 updates			1
more than a quarter ( 29 per cent ) admit that their lives are simply too boring without a bit of embellishing on their @entity282 in 10 people have made their @entity7 updates more colourful , 40 per cent on @entity279 and five per cent on other social media web sites			1
examples of fibs include moaning about still being at work while on your way home , claiming to have spotted a celebrity , boosting culture credentials by pretending to visit a museum or art gallery , embellishing restaurant visits and claiming someone else 's @entity279 joke as your own			0
@entity258 brand ambassador @entity300 , of boy band @entity301 , said : ' this research shows that social networkers are almost embarrassed by not having a good time			2
' but people should not be disappointed by their lives			0
it 's not just about the money			0
the real social currency lies in going to amazing events and having great experiences you can then share with friends and followers online			0
' the research was commissioned by @entity258 to launch its new ' bespoke offers ' personalised shopping service .			0

the unique study follows the interests of *1million* @entity7 users
shows the sexes become interested in different topics at different ages
