even without a scrap of make - up , @entity0 looked unrecognizable when she was spotted over the weekend for the first time since last monday 's @entity4			2
the 45 - year - old @entity6 actress - who has dismissed surgery speculations as ' silly ' - appeared somewhat tired and anxious as she ran errands over the weekend in @entity9 , where she is about to start filming her latest movie , @entity10			2
when quizzed by the paparazzi over all the media attention surrounding her face , @entity14 , as she climbed into her car , replied : ' @entity17 , you 're going to ask me that question ! can you excuse me please ? i have better things to do and i 'm sure you do too			1
' is that really you ? even without a scrap of make - up , @entity0 looked unrecognizable when she was spotted over the weekend for the first time since last monday 's @entity4 the actress , whose shocking new look has sent commentators into a frenzy of speculation over what sort of cosmetic procedures she may have had done , politely declined to answer any further questions as she prepared to drive off			2
' i 'd just like to have my day to myself if you do n't mind , ' she said			2
her make - up free face put to bed any speculation that perhaps her unusual new look last week was a result of make - up trickery			2
@entity14 has since dismissed web - chatter over her so - called surgery as ' silly			1
' ' it seems the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth , which does n't exist wo n't get off my porch until i answer the door , ' she told people			2
' i 'm glad folks think i look different ! i 'm living a different , happy , more fulfilling life , and i 'm thrilled that perhaps it shows			2
' upper - eye lift ? the @entity53 winner shocked fans last monday with her startlingly different face at the @entity56			1
pictured ( left ) last week and ( right ) as @entity6 in 2001 new look : @entity14 wore her hair scraped back into a scruffy bundle atop her head and seemed to have broken out with a cold sore on her upper lip back off : when quizzed by the paparazzi over all the media attention surrounding her face , @entity14 replied , ' @entity65 you 're going to ask me that question ! can you excuse me please ? ' no jowls here : @entity14 's jawline is unusually pronounced and tight for a woman of 45 running errands : her make - up free face put to bed any speculation that perhaps her unusual new look last week was a result of make - up trickery what surgery ? last week , @entity14 dismissed web - chatter over her so - called surgery as ' silly ' greetings : she said , ' it seems the folks who come digging around for some nefarious truth , which does n't exist wo n't get off my porch until i answer the door ' @entity90 spoke to @entity92 - based plastic surgeon dr. @entity91 to get his theory on the matter			1
' in my opinion , @entity14 underwent a blepharoplasty which entails removing the perceived excess amount of eyelid skin and fat from the area between the eyebrow and the upper eyelash , ' he says			1
' the resulting scar will be hidden within the normal upper eyelid crease which is a natural curve			1
however , one could not see this natural curve in @entity106 prior to surgery since all we saw was a straight sheet of skin starting from her nose to the outside of her eye itself			1
' though the procedure was performed conservatively , it unveiled her eyes which were " hiding " behind this drape of skin			1
' there she is ! only when she smiles do we catch a glimpse of the spirited old @entity14 we once knew casual : the case 39 actress - who has been romancing @entity123 since 2012 - said she 's spent the past few years ' making a home , ' ' loving someone , ' and ' growing into myself ' flattered : @entity14 also said last week , ' i 'm glad folks think i look different ! i 'm living a different , happy , more fulfilling life , and i 'm thrilled that perhaps it shows ' what 's so funny ? according to celebrity make - up artist @entity130 , whose clients include @entity132 and @entity133 , the star ' clearly has had some work done ' dr @entity91 elaborated : ' @entity14 's defining trademark characteristic was her small , squinty eyes , which complemented her quirky personality perfectly			1
' now that it is gone , she is unrecognizable			0
additionally , she has lost some subcutaneous facial fat during her absence from the public spotlight which can be attributed to normal aging			1
to summarize , it 's not that she looks bad at all , it 's just that she looks different			0
' @entity148 - based plastic surgeon dr @entity146 went as far as to say @entity14 's presumed surgery is an improvement			1
' it seems pretty obvious she had a blepharoplasty			1
she also seems to have had @entity155 injections to smooth her forehead and possibly fillers to cheek and midface area , ' he tells @entity90			1
' i felt she always needed the upper eyelid lift , even years ago			1
i think she looks much better and the procedure was a success			0
' she does not look overdone , but she does look different because , she had such heavy upper eyelids for so long			2
' @entity165 , a professor of @entity166 at @entity167 in @entity168 points out that @entity14 's eyes were actually formally an important characteristic of her partly ' eastern ' heritage			1
' the reason @entity14 looked distinguished is because she is an unusual genetic mixture , with a @entity175 father and a mother who is part @entity177 and part @entity179			1
' this , in turns , means that , rather like @entity184 singer @entity183 - whose ancestry is @entity186 - she has an ' eastern ' face ... and has had plastic surgery which makes her look less @entity179 , less @entity177 , and more stereotypically ' @entity189			2
' he adds : ' how sad			0
she was so much more beautiful and interesting when she had the courage to be @entity179 and @entity177			0
' different woman : last week , apart from her ultra line - free forehead and suspiciously puffy face , she also had much lighter and patchier eyebrows than usual there 's no denying it : the star 's appearance has changed dramatically over the years the case 39 actress - who 's been romancing @entity123 since 2012 - said she 's spent the past few years ' making a home , ' ' loving someone , ' and ' growing into myself			0
' ' my friends say that i look peaceful			0
i am healthy , ' @entity0 insisted			0
' for a long time i was n't doing such a good job with that			0
i took on a schedule that is not realistically sustainable and did n't allow for taking care of myself			0
' rather than stopping to recalibrate , i kept running until i was depleted and made bad choices about how to conceal the exhaustion			0
i was aware of the chaos and finally chose different things			0
' the star was at @entity4 's 21st annual women in @entity217 at the @entity218 in @entity219 when she debuted her new look , prompting fans to voice their concern			0
apart from her ultra line - free forehead and suspiciously puffy face , she also had much lighter and patchier eyebrows than usual			0
according to celebrity make - up artist @entity130 , whose clients include @entity132 and @entity133 , the star ' clearly has had some work done '			0
she told @entity90 : ' the texture of her skin looks like she has gone a little too far with a chemical peel as its texture looks very smooth and plastic - like shiny , yet the color on top looks like the remnants of fake tan			1
' ms @entity130 added : ' she is known for cute but heavy lidded eyes and it appears as though she has had some sort of lift , maybe a bit of @entity155 by the brow as well to open up her eyes			0
i am all for a secret nip and tuck but in small doses , so you still look like a fresher , rested version of you … not an unrecognizable one			0
' the shapelessness of her brows merely serves to further ' distort ' the new frame of her face , says ms @entity130 .			0

plastic surgeon dr. @entity91 *suggests* @entity14 has *undergone* a blepharoplasty
this entails ' removing the perceived excess eyelid skin and fat from the area between the eyebrow and the upper eyelash '
