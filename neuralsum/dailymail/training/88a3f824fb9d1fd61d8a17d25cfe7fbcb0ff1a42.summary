by @entity0 last updated at 7:46 am on 3rd october 2011 the hugely - anticipated launch of the @entity2 is only two days away - and speculation is mounting over what the must - have gadget will look like			1
now designers have developed a mock - up , showing a slightly wider device to its predecessor and a four - inch screen covering the whole model			2
experts at @entity13 have compiled leaked hints , hardware components and computer designs to show how they think it will appear			1
the @entity13 mock - up shows a ‘ teardrop ’ design , aluminium back instead of glass and an oval rather than a circular ‘ home ’ button			1
the mute switch is expected to move to the other side of the phone but the camera placement is likely to remain unchanged from the @entity40			2
