@entity8 , 26 , is accused of slipping the 30mg @entity10 tablets into @entity12 's can while he left the room to go to the toilet			1
mr @entity12 , 30 , who was four foot tall , came back and remarked ' my beer tastes funny ' but @entity8 told him to ' just drink it ' and three hours later he was dead , the jury was told			1
' joke gone wrong ' : @entity12 , 30 , died after his beer was spiked with 27 anti-depressant tablets , a court was told he was found slumped in an armchair at the house in @entity23 , @entity24 , by friend @entity25 who tried in vain to revive him			1
@entity27 heard that @entity8 kept quiet about what he had done until a month later when he confessed that he had spiked the drink			2
' victim ' : mr @entity12 , 30 , was discovered dead in a chair at the property in @entity23 , @entity24 he told his father @entity32 he had put the tablets in mr @entity12 's beer and ‘ may have accidentally killed him ’			1
and the @entity36 claims he told his sister @entity37 he had spiked the drink because he ‘ thought it would be a laugh ’			2
the court also heard that mr @entity12 's sister @entity42 , 38 , befriended @entity8 on @entity43 and he told her : ' @entity42 , i am so sorry			1
i put 27 of my mirtazapine tablets into @entity12 ’s beer that night			2
' a post-mortem found that the victim , who weighed just six stone , had consumed an amount of mirtazapine that had proved fatal in others			2
@entity53 , prosecuting , said : ' he ( @entity8 ) accepted putting the pills into @entity12 ’s beer			1
he said it was done as a joke			0
' there is no suggestion he did anything intending to kill @entity12			2
it may well have been done as a joke but we have to look at the consequences of that			0
' @entity65 , defending , said : ' it was pretty obvious it was a stupid thing to do			0
they were friends , they were good mates			0
he did n’t intend to cause harm			0
some hours later the friend was found dead			0
' however , the defence barrister said the critical question for the jury was whether the tablets were the cause of mr @entity12 's death			1
mr @entity77 added : ' he ( the defendant ) ca n’t help you with that , so you wo n’t be hearing from him			0
you wo n’t be deprived of hearing what he has said about what he has done			0
' it is not a question of gagging him			0
it is simply how can he assist with this crucial question ? ' questions to be answered were how toxic the drug was and could a person be given 27 of the tablets and survive ? ' or is it the case if you are given them you are likely to die ? i think we will hear that is not the case			0
' mr @entity77 said it was possible to die from the amount of alcohol mr @entity12 had in his system			1
death : mr @entity12 was drinking with friends in this house in @entity23 , @entity24 , when he allegedly had the anti-depressant tablets slipped into his beer he said it was possible he could have died from a combination of sleep apnoea and too much alcohol			1
he added : ' if that is correct , the @entity36 may be in difficulty in proving that mirtazapine played a requisite part in his death			0
' mr @entity12 was confirmed dead at a house in @entity23 , @entity24 , where he had gone to drink with friends @entity8 , @entity120 and @entity25 who lived there			1
mr @entity25 said mr @entity12 , mr @entity8 and a friend called @entity123 had been drinking strong lager and cider on the night in question			1
he went back on october 22 and saw mr @entity12 was lying in an armchair with his head back and appeared to be asleep			1
there were a lot of empty beer cans			0
mr @entity25 said : ' i did n’t wake him as when he is awoken after drinking he gets annoyed			0
' i went downstairs and fed the dog and watched tv			0
i thought something was n’t right because @entity12 was n’t snoring and he does quite loudly			2
it was cold , like being in the freezer			0
' accused : @entity8 , 26 , who is standing trial at @entity27 , is accused of manslaughter and also faces an alternative charge of administering poison or noxious substance as to endanger life mr @entity25 said he called his ex-girlfriend and mr @entity12 ’s sister @entity146 and she told him to splash water over his face			1
nothing happened , so he threw all the water over him			0
he called for an ambulance and was told to try cpr on mr @entity12			1
he did so until paramedics arrived , but mr @entity12 was later pronounced dead			1
mr @entity25 said he received a message form @entity8 on @entity43 saying : ' i am sorry , i gave @entity12 27 tablets in his beer			1
' @entity8 asked him on the telephone what he should do and mr @entity25 said he told him he should hand himself in , the court heard			2
