by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:40 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 has picked the former @entity5 police commissioner who cleaned up the city in the 1990s to lead the department once again			1
@entity8 , 66 , rose to national fame under mayor @entity10 for his ' zero tolerance ' approach to policing and his ' broken windows ' strategy of targeting small infractions as a way to combat more serious crimes and lower murder rates			1
he also pioneered @entity20 , the data - driven system of tracking crimes that is now used by nearly every major police force in the nation			0
critics have already chimed in , saying that @entity8 is a bad choice if the mayor - elect wants to move away from tactics like stop - and - frisk and improve @entity31 relations with the city 's black and @entity33 communities			1
city councilman @entity35 called @entity8 's appointment ' unconscionable ' and said he was the man who invented stop - and - frisk and other strategies that disproportionately target minorities			1
one councilman says @entity8 is the man who invented stop - and - frisk @entity8 , right , rose to fame under @entity5 mayor @entity10 , left , in the 1990s for overseeing a massive drop in crime with his ' zero tolerance ' policies @entity50 made reducing stop - and - frisk one of the keys to his candidacy as mayor			1
his opponents claimed this meant he would be soft on crime and would return @entity5 to the ' bad old days ' of high murder rates			1
but @entity8 has supported such tactics in the past - even calling stop - and - frisk ' essential to every police department in @entity61			1
' as @entity62 he oversaw a 49percent increase in police stops			0
he was nearly the top cop in @entity65 , as well			0
prime minister @entity66 wanted him to lead the @entity67 , but his nomination was blocked by the @entity69 , which said the @entity67 commissioner must be both familiar with @entity72 laws and a @entity72 citizen			0
on thursday de @entity3 introduced @entity8 as a ' proven crime - fighter ' - signaling that he wanted a man with a history of tough tactics to lead the city 's 34,500 officers			1
' together , we are going to preserve and deepen the historic gains we 've made in public safety - gains @entity8 helped make possible , ' @entity3 said in a statement			2
@entity8 , who has also led the @entity85 and @entity86 police departments , will succeed @entity87 , the @entity31 's longest - serving commissioner			1
he is arguably the most important administration appointment for @entity3 , a @entity89 who takes office january 1			0
@entity8 beat out a black and a @entity33 candidate for the job of @entity5 's top cop - but @entity3 said his hiring will still pave the way for better relationship between the @entity31 and minority groups in			1
he said the city can keep its crime rates low by ' rejecting the false choice between keeping @entity5 safe and protecting their civil rights			1
this is an administration that will do both			0
' the bad old days : when @entity8 took over , murders topped 1,500 a year and middle class families fled for the suburbs in droves @entity8 , holding a library book called ' your police , ' which inspired him to go into law enforcement , pledged to forge a better relationship between the @entity31 and minority communities when @entity8 was hired as @entity5 police commissioner in 1994 , there were 1,561 murders in the city			1
when he left in 1996 , there were 983			0
he oversaw a 60percent drop in homicides in just two years - and he says he did it by focusing on vandals , petty thieves and squeegee men who harassed motorists			0
@entity8 adopted a ' zero tolerance ' policy toward crime and employed the ' broken windows ' theory that small - time lawlessness leads to big - time crime			2
police fanned out across the city and cracked down on small crimes			0
combined with civil efforts spear - headed by mayor @entity10 , broken windows were fixed and graffiti was washed away			1
crimes such as subway fare evasion , public drinking and public urination were no longer ignored			0
the tactic remains controversial - though some see it as the precursor to ' stop and frisk			2
' proponents say stop and frisk works by getting guns off the streets and by putting criminals on notice that they are likely of being caught if they carry drugs or weapons - even if they appear to be doing nothing wrong			2
subsequent studies , however , have disputed the efficacy of ' broken windows ' policies			0
he said @entity8 can ' heal some of the wounds , reopen the communication ' and that @entity8 would ' avoid focusing resources where they do n't belong , which is on innocent , hardworking @entity5 , particularly on our young men of color			1
' at the press conference announcing his appointment , @entity8 held up a children 's library book , ' your police , ' which he said made him decide to became a police officer			1
he pledged responsive , responsible policing			0
' this is not deja vu all over again , ' @entity8 said			2
' if we get it right , if we make the city safe , if we do it in a way that the public trusts us , then the benefits are extraordinary			0
if we get it right here , this is in many respects a beacon that can light the world			0
' i do n't want to do it all over again the same way			0
i want what ( @entity3 ) is promising - a new day			0
' he said some stop - and - frisk tactics are necessary - but suggested they will be scaled back from the current level under his leadership			1
' stop and frisk is essential to every police department in @entity61			2
but itâ € ™ s also essential that it be done constitutionally and respectfully			0
and that is my commitment to this mayor and to the city that it will be done that way , ' he said			0
that promise is n't enough for @entity5 councilman @entity35 , who said that @entity8 ' failed us ' when he was commissioner in the 1990s			1
' @entity8 is the architect of racial profiling stop and frisk , ' he told @entity215			1
@entity216 , which is spearheading the legal action over stop - and - frisk , sounded a note of caution			2
' we hope @entity8 's appointment is not a signal from @entity3 that the @entity31 will be ramping up so - called ' broken windows ' policing , surveillance , and numbers - driven policing			1
as mr. @entity8 himself has stated , constitutional policing is not inconsistent with effective policing , ' the group said in a statement			2
@entity8 made the cover of @entity235 in 1996 for his success at lowering the crime rate in @entity5 @entity8 , a @entity85 native , got his start in the national spotlight as the @entity85 police commissioner			1
he pioneered the ' @entity20 ' strategy of policing through the analysis of crime statistics @entity247 leader the @entity245 acknowledged he has been both an ally and adversary to @entity8 during his previous tenure , but hopes the leaders can work together ' to continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community			2
' @entity8 , known for his outsized personality and fondness for the limelight , was police commissioner under @entity10 , a @entity259 , from 1994 to 1996			1
he emphasized the broken - windows theory of police work : that criminals who commit small crimes , such as vandalism , also commit more serious crimes			0
@entity8 helped spearhead the use of @entity20 , a data - driven system of tracking crimes that allows police to better allocate their resources to high - crime areas			1
the real - time system is still used today			0
@entity273 immediately plummeted under @entity8 , who benefited from an influx of new police officers			2
the year before @entity8 took office , there were 1,946 murders citywide ; by contrast , in 1996 there were 983 , the first time it had dipped under 1,000 since 1968			2
but @entity8 frequently fought with @entity10 over who deserved the lion 's share of the credit			1
he resigned after two years			0
@entity8 is the only man to ever lead the police departments in both @entity5 and @entity86			1
and he would have been the police commissioner in @entity65 , as well , if @entity66 had had his way			2
the 66 - year - old @entity8 is recognized as one of the foremost experts on policing in the world and pioneered tactics that are used in nearly every major city in the country today			2
he began his career as a beat cop in his native @entity85 after serving in the @entity297			0
he quickly rose through the ranks and served as @entity85 police commissioner for six months from 1993 to 1994			1
in 1994 , @entity10 appointed @entity300 - continuing his ' broken windows ' strategy that he pursued when he was @entity5 transit police chief from 1990 until 1992			1
crime fell dramatically under @entity8 's tenure - but he quickly clashed with the mayor over who deserved credit for making the city safer			1
@entity10 also disagreed with some of @entity8 's policies			1
he resigned from the department in 1996 amid allegations of ethics violations - which @entity8 allies said were minor and politically - motivated			0
in 2002 , he was hired to lead the @entity314 as the department sought to repair its reputation in the wake of the @entity86 riots			0
he lowered crime and was widely credited with improving police relations with the community			0
he served in @entity86 until 2009 - when he left to work as a private consultant			2
in 2011 , prime minister @entity66 offered to make him commissioner of the @entity67 in @entity65 , as the city recovered from riots and spike in crime			0
home secretary @entity325 objected , however , and said he could not lead the force because he was neither a @entity72 citizen nor familiar with @entity72 laws			0
instead , he joined as a consultant			0
for his work , he was awarded the @entity330 .			0

@entity8 first served as @entity31 commissioner under mayor @entity10 in the 1990s when crime dropped dramatically
has also led @entity85 and @entity86 police departments
will be *tasked* with maintaining @entity5 's low crime rate while reducing ' stop and frisk ' tactics
