for little @entity1 the changing seasons heralds an exciting opportunity - the chance to play outside with her friends			1
the five - year - old spends the warm summer months watching from the window desperate to play in the sunshine			1
a rare skin condition , which leaves @entity9 covered in painful scales , has held her hostage in her @entity13 home			1
when she was born doctors diagnosed her with the extremely rare illness non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma ( @entity16 )			1
it is excruciating and sunshine and heat exacerbates the painful symptoms			1
@entity1 , from @entity13 , is forced to stay indoors during the summer months			2
she was born with an extremely rare skin condition , which causes scales to form all over her skin			2
sunshine and heat aggravates the illness , causing her excruciating pain but with winter around the corner , the five - year - old is excited at the prospect of getting outside to play with friends			1
doctors diagnosed the youngster with non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma at birth her mother @entity37 , pictured with husband @entity38 , said she knew something was wrong as soon as she had given birth after an emergency c - section @entity9 's mother , @entity37 , 33 , said as soon as she gave birth to her daughter , via emergency c - section , she knew something was wrong			1
' when @entity9 was born she had scales all over her skin - it looks like she has been burnt , ' she said			1
' doctors did n't think she 'd make it			2
' because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she can not play outside when it is hot			0
' she ca n't play any sports because she will get too hot too quickly			0
' a lot of children do n't understand why she ca n't join them outside			0
this just makes it harder for @entity9 because the kids will not play with her			2
' but now she is really looking forward to the winter			0
she can not wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends			0
' @entity9 , from @entity63 , @entity13 was diagnosed with @entity16 when she was born - a life - long condition which causes severe scaling of the skin			2
one of the complications of the illness , is that it prevents the normal process of sweating			0
it means sunlight and exercise can aggravate @entity9 's skin , making her condition more painful			1
mrs @entity1 , said : ' because of her skin we have to say no to her when she asks to do certain things which is heart - breaking			1
' she wants to go to @entity80 but we just ca n't let her			0
there have been so many birthday parties she has asked to go to that we have to just say no because of the heat			0
mrs @entity1 , said : ' because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she can not play outside when it is hot			1
now she is really looking forward to the winter			0
she can not wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends ' the life - long condition is inherited and caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding			2
severe scaling of the skin prevents normal sweating so hot weather or vigorous exercise causes painful repercussions for @entity9 ' but it is amazing when the winter comes each year because we can let her go outside			1
' i am really looking forward to it because i love that she will be able to go outside and play			0
' when mrs @entity1 went into labour and gave birth at just 32 weeks , she immediately knew something was wrong with her daughter			1

' but i was n't allowed to go with her because i had just had a c - section			0
' they bought her in to see me first and she was in a big bag covering her body with just her little head sticking out			0
' mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity38 , 38 , were warned their daughter may not survive , before their newborn was transferred to the @entity131			1
but after nine days in the hospital 's neonatal unit , @entity134 and mrs @entity1 were able to take their little girl home , on @entity138			1

after nine days in hospital , the couple were overjoyed to be able to bring @entity9 home , on @entity138 due to her condition @entity9 's parents were forced to withdraw her from school , after she came home each day crying in pain			2
mrs @entity1 added : ' the most important lesson i have learned is to take one day at a time , have faith and enjoy the life you have been given ' non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma is an extremely rare skin disorder , characterised by abnormal scaling of the skin with underlying redness			1
it is estimated to occur in one in 300,000 births			0
the skin appears bright red , and has accompanying fine white or flesh coloured scales			0
the scales are often seen all over a sufferer 's body , but the skin on the face may show milder changes			2
the condition is usually detected in the first few days of life , and is a life - long condition for most sufferers			2
it is caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding			0
one in four children will inherit two abnormal genes - one from each parent - and therefore develop the condition			0
complications of the condition include : there is currently no cure for @entity16			0
treatments include preventing overheating , specific creams , drugs , as well as psychological support and counselling			0

' having been warned @entity9 might not survive beyond two weeks , mrs @entity1 said her daughter has gone from strength to strength			1
' they said even if she did , she would n't be able to crawl or walk , ' she said			2
' but you just have to take a look at her now to see she is doing both of these things and she is doing amazingly well			0
' while @entity9 has proved doctors wrong , excelling in her development , the illness does hold her back from every day activities			1
despite loving school , @entity9 's parents had to make the difficult decision to withdraw her from classes , because it proved too much for her			2
' she would come home and cry every night because her legs hurt after trying to keep up with the other children , ' mrs @entity1 said			1
' it was such a shame because it was a massive milestone to reach , another one the doctors had said would n't happen , but she made it and she loved it			0
' despite this , mrs @entity1 is determined her daughter will excel in life			1
