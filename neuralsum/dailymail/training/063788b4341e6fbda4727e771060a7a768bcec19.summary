' @entity10 and his @entity51 loved going to see @entity57 play rugby together , which every november has a big ' @entity60 ' campaign , so there was that angle too			2

as a family they expanded the fake moustache concept to @entity10 dressing up as a different famous character each day in november , from @entity17 to @entity74 to @entity75 @entity10 's 12th birthday was on november 1 , so he and his mother posted photos of @entity10 in his different outfits , asking friends and family to make a donation towards his @entity1 campaign , rather than buy him a present			1
