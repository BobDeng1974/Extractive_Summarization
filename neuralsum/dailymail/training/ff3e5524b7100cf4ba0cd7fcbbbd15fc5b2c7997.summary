@entity0 have branded their @entity2 television snub ' absolutely ridiculous ' after missing out on a £ 250,000 payday			1
the @entity5 side pulled off one of the biggest upsets in the competition 's history when they came from two goals down to win 4 - 2 at @entity11 leaders @entity12 in the fourth round			1
they were rewarded with a home tie against the winners of @entity17 and @entity19 's replay but tv chiefs at the @entity21 and @entity22 have chosen not to screen their fifth - round game			1
@entity25 beats the @entity12 defence and slots home past @entity28 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity0 @entity25 celebrates scoring the winning goal as his @entity0 team - mates enjoy the moment @entity33 vs @entity34 @entity35 vs @entity36 or @entity37 @entity38 vs @entity39 @entity40 vs @entity41 @entity42 or @entity43 vs @entity44 or @entity45 the club ’s official @entity52 feed simply posted ‘ # nomagic ’ , while @entity0 joint - chairman @entity54 said : ‘ @entity21 and @entity22 have let themselves down with this			1
they ’ve really shot themselves in the foot			0
we ’ve scored the most goals of any club in the @entity2 this season , we ’ve just pulled off the biggest shock in history and they do n’t come and get us			1
‘ i ’ve had calls from everywhere since we beat @entity12			1
i was talking to @entity63 in @entity64 and to @entity65 — everyone wants to know about what we ’ve achieved			0
‘ the whole world is looking at us at the moment and the tv broadcasters do n’t put us on			0
you ’ve got to wonder if the people who decide these things actually know about football			0
’ instead , the @entity76 v @entity34 tie , @entity35 v @entity36 or @entity37 , @entity38 v @entity39 , @entity40 v @entity41 and @entity42 or @entity43 v @entity44 or @entity45 will be shown live from february 14 - 16			2
@entity54 added : ‘ who picks these games ? @entity33 v @entity34 , is that really what the @entity2 is all about ? they all promote the @entity2 ’s magic and romance , but where ’s the magic gone now ? how can they justify it ? it ’s a disgrace			2
’ @entity85 joint - chairman @entity54 has blasted the television snub , calling it absolutely ridiculous @entity0 manager @entity87 ( right ) and his players and staff celebrate their third goal @entity0 's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full - time whistle he said the club felt further aggrieved over losing the windfall they would have received through television revenue			1
‘ that goes to the @entity11 clubs , because they really need the money , do n’t they ? ’ he added , sarcastically			0
the @entity21 said they had considered the draw carefully before choosing the fixtures to show live and hope to present @entity106 from @entity107			2
a @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ tv match selections have to be decided before the outcome of replays and for that reason we have selected what we believe to be the best fixtures , given all the potential scenarios			0
’ a @entity22 spokesman said : ‘ we aim to cover the teams and stories that appeal to as wide a number of fans as possible , while staying true to the traditions of the competition			0
