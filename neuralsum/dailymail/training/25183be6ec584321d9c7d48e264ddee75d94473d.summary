@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s integrity should not be questioned as he promised @entity3 they will be going all out to torpedo @entity5 ’s title hopes			1
there has been an unusual atmosphere around @entity9 building up to tomorrow ’s showdown at @entity11 , as @entity3 supporters are praying for the home win that would re-hand them the initiative in the race for the @entity16			1
many @entity17 , however , have indicated they would be able to stomach a first home defeat to @entity5 in five years as it would prove detrimental to @entity3 ’s hopes of becoming domestic champions for the first time since 1990			1
focus : @entity0 insists his @entity2 side will be fully committed to beating @entity5 on saturday @entity0 , who is surrounded by a backroom staff full of devout @entity17 , has described the idea of fans wanting their own team to lose as “ banter ” but has given an assurance to their neighbours that his side will not lie down			1
@entity2 , after all , still have an outside chance of finishing in the top four and he believes two victories over @entity36 's side and @entity37 would put pressure on @entity39 , which is why @entity0 can say with certainty that he will be sending his players out to win			1
' there is not even a question mark about us , ' said @entity0			1
' for us it means everything to win this game in terms of the overall season			2
i can understand the banter between the fans but @entity3 can be assured that @entity11 will be the toughest place for @entity5 to travel this season , that is for sure			1
returning : both @entity56 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) could be in line for a return against @entity5 ' we need to get the six points , that 's vital for us			2
i do n't see it as a serious accusation			0
i think it is more football rivalry , a bit of banter , which i can understand			0
i would be hurt or insulted if we had nothing to play for and even then our professionalism was in doubt but that is not even in question now			0
' we have got so much to play for			0
i still think it would be a major ending to the season if we were to finish with 75 points			2
whatever people might say on the outside , i do n't take it seriously			0
we have got too much to fight for			0
' each place in the @entity16 is worth £ 1.25million in prize money , which is revenue @entity2 do not want to lose by falling down the table			1
there would also be the side effect of having to start next season in late july if they finished sixth , as they would go into the @entity91 qualifiers			2
' the money you get for each position is important but it 's not just that , ' said @entity0			1
' as a professional group and a team we represent @entity2			2
that means we represent every single player that has played for @entity2 in the past and our work for the last ten months			2
' you would n't come in now and not give your all to finish as good as you can			0
' loan stars : @entity105 ( above left ) , @entity107 ( above right ) , @entity109 ( bottom left ) and @entity111 ( bottom right ) have been vital in @entity2 's push for @entity115 football this season controversial : @entity0 has been criticised for his use of the loan system in shaping his team this might be new territory as a manager but , during his playing career , he experienced how unusual cross-city enmity can be			1
' my debut with @entity126 was against @entity127 in 1993 , ' he recalled			0
' it was the last game of the season			0
@entity130 were playing away at @entity131 and @entity130 had to win to win the league and in order for @entity127 to get into @entity134 automatically			0
' @entity130 were losing and the @entity127 crowd was going crazy , even though that meant they were out of @entity138 line they used after the game was “ we would rather lose one eye as long as the neighbours lose two " - i could n't understand it			0

win for @entity2 could see @entity3 go six points clear of @entity146
@entity0 determined to keep his side focused on their own business
@entity2 need at least four points from final two games to have chance of @entity115
