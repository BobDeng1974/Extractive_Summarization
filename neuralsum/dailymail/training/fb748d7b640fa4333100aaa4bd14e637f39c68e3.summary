the @entity1 commander who ordered the controversial fire - bombing of @entity3 which killed an estimated 25,000 civilians during @entity5 said he would do it again in a long lost interview filmed 30 years after the end of the conflict			1
former marshal of the @entity1 , sir @entity10 , gave the green light for the 1945 bombing which reduced the city in @entity14 , @entity15 , to rubble			1
the attack was widely criticised because of ' blanket bombing ' which hit civilian areas as well as military targets - killing thousands of innocents			1
but the newly - discovered interview with sir @entity10 , which was filmed in 1977 and will be aired for the first time on the @entity25 tonight , shows the @entity1 chief defending his decision			1
scroll down to watch video commander : air marshal @entity10 , who planned the majority of the @entity1 's night raids during @entity5 , is seen at work in his office casualties : around 25,000 people were killed by @entity37 bombers over the course of two night raids on the city of @entity3 in @entity14 , @entity15 , in february 1945 fresh evidence : footage of @entity43 being interviewed by air vice marshal @entity44 has emerged 36 years after it was filmed and the chief commander of the @entity46 tells his interviewer , air vice marshal @entity44 , that he would do it again if he had to			1
he said : ' if i had to have the same time again i would do the same again , but i hope i would n’t have to			0
' sir @entity10 then adds : ' i hope it ’s been of some use , for future generations in keeping them out of these riots			1
it never does anybody any good			0
' during the interview , @entity44 discusses how many felt the @entity3 attack was ' a city too far '			1
however @entity10 stood his ground saying : ' the bombers kept over a million fit @entity15 out of the @entity15 army … manning the anti-aircraft defences ; making the ammunition , and doing urgent repairs , especially tradesmen			2
' interview : sir @entity10 said he would still make the same decision to bomb @entity3 if given his time again reduced to rubble : the ' blanket bombing ' of @entity3 was widely criticised as civilian areas were hit as well as military targets destruction : the capital of @entity14 was left in ruins after the @entity37 air bombings with the @entity77 , pictured in the background , reduced to a shell of a building @entity10 also countered the myth that area bombing was his idea - claiming it was already @entity83 policy			1
he said : ' i lived in a shower of directives from the day i took over to the last day of war			0
' the directive when i took over was that i was n't to specifically aim at anything unless ordered to do so and to blast the @entity15 cities as a whole			0
' @entity92 @entity43 , head of the @entity93 , said it was @entity83 policy not to bomb specific targets @entity44 asked @entity10 why he was ordered to bomb whole cities rather than specific @entity98 targets			1
in response , @entity10 said : ' they came to the conclusion that they were n’t hitting very much and they did n’t have very much to hit things with … ' sir @entity10 , who died in 1984 aged 91 , refused a peerage because his men were denied a campaign medal			1
the @entity46 , which suffered the highest casualty rate of any @entity111 unit , losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men , eventually got a memorial last year			0
it was erected despite numerous objections from @entity15 politicians			0
@entity46 veteran @entity116 , 89 , who is now secretary of the @entity117 , backed his former commander			0
he told the @entity119 : ' our raids meant there were 10,000 88mm anti-aircraft guns pointing up to the sky instead of at our troops and the @entity126			0
' @entity3 was a major centre for the manufacture of opticals , such as gun sights and binoculars			0
' he added : ' after @entity3 we lost another 700 bombers , and @entity135 was being hit by @entity136 which nobody could fight against			0
' it was initially claimed that up to 250,000 civilians lost their lives in the @entity3 bombings but an official report released after the war showed the casualty figure was in fact closer to 25,000			1
over two days and nights in february 1945 @entity111 and @entity147 bombers turned the city into a sea of flames and rubble			0
air raids : @entity3 can be seen in flames following allied bombings in february 1945 restoration : residents can be seen working on the removal of debris from @entity3 's @entity160 street in 1952 the victims - mostly women and children - died in savage firestorms whipped up by the intense heat of 2,400 tons of high explosive and 1,500 tons of incendiary bombs			1
the newly - found footage will shed more light on @entity3 and the actions of the @entity1 during @entity5			1
professor @entity169 , @entity170 , said : ' it ’s interesting because it ’s not done immediately after the second world war , it ’s done at a time when there have already been several waves of interpretation about @entity46 , about @entity10 himself and so one not only gets his memories which are still clearly quite fresh , but also is commentary on those different interpretations			2
' it ’s a multi-layered interview and all the more interesting for it			2
' sir @entity43 was appointed commander - in - chief of @entity184 - the unit responsible for defending @entity111 from aerial attacks and bombing enemy targets - in 1942			1
in the early part of the war , the @entity46 ’s raids had little effect			0
the bombers only flew at night to reduce the danger of being shot down , but with primitive navigation equipment , this made it difficult to identify and hit a small target			0
in 1941 , it was decided that @entity184 would target entire industrial cities - known as area or blanket bombing			1
this policy was endorsed by @entity202 and formally adopted in early 1942 as sir @entity10 took the helm of @entity184			1
@entity10 said at the start of the bombing campaign that he was unleashing a whirlwind on @entity15			2
working class housing areas were targeted because they had a higher density and firestorms were more likely			0
this disrupted the @entity15 workforce and the @entity15 capability of producing more weapons			0
the plan was highly controversial even before it started , but the @entity216 thought bombing was the only option available to attack @entity15 directly as a major invasion of the continent was years away			2
the @entity221 were also demanding that the @entity222 do something to relieve the pressure on the @entity225			0
brave : the @entity46 , pictured , lost more soldiers than other unit during @entity5 @entity3 was one of the cities targeted with ' area bombings '			2
around 25,000 civilians were killed by allied bombs dropped over the course of two days in february 1945			1
the tactic has been strongly criticised leading to accusations of war crimes			0
the @entity46 suffered the highest casualty rate of any @entity111 unit - losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men			0
after opposition from @entity15 politicians , a memorial to @entity184 was finally unveiled in @entity244 , @entity135 , last year			2
tribute : the memorial to the bomber that was unveiled in @entity244 , @entity135 , last year video : excerpt from @entity251 interview that has surfaced from the @entity252			2
