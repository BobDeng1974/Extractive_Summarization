her models meld into the grey @entity2 as if they 're made of mirrors and glass			1
now body artist @entity5 has spoken about her head - turning technique , painstakingly painting women so they blend in with @entity9 's landmarks , after her incredible creations made headlines around the world			1
the 33 - year - old shuns studios and canvases , instead letting her nude models camouflage seamlessly into the world around them			1
the 33 - year - old began her inspiring project after moving to @entity9 from @entity29 because she wanted to provide a ' reflective view within the landscape ' fame : these images have been viewed around the world - now body artist @entity5 has given an insight into how she creates her work , despite run - ins with police on the left , a body painted model sits on a bridge with her back to the camera , gazing out across the city with houses , the bridge and the skyline painted across her			1
while on the right , the model faces the camera with the spectacular @entity52 as her backdrop - with only her brightly coloured shoes clearly distinguishable they have been photographed in front of the @entity52 and @entity58 , @entity59 , the @entity24 and the iconic towers of downtown @entity2			1
it 's not an easy process - the models must be painted live on the streets in a process that takes several hours and can attract some unwanted attention			1
but the law is firmly on her side , as the city of @entity9 allows people to strip off in public for the purposes of artistic expression - even if that does n't stop police approaching the artist altogether			1
ms @entity5 came up with the idea after moving to @entity9 from the @entity29 area earlier this year			1
' i wanted to engage the city and understand it and make some observations , ' she said			0
behind the scenes : the painstaking works by @entity5 ( left ) take hours to create and have to be done in public , leading passers - by to gawk in wonder @entity87 , who posed in front of the @entity23 , said : ' you feel the transformation process			1
the brush itself , it 's really soft			0
it feels more like a massage ' body of work : the artist must wait until there is no chance of rain			0
in one shoot , she had to repaint her model after a van that was in the background drove away nothing to see here : during this shoot last week , a police officer stopped and spoke to the artist after receiving a complaint about her unusual work			0
the law in @entity9 has been laid down after decades of legal wrangling and firmly allows people to be nude in public if it is for the purpose of a performance or artistic expression ' so instead of a person right in front of the empire state building or the @entity125 , they 're softly in the background , and you 've got more of a reflective view of the person within the landscape			1
' photographers followed the artist as she went through the process of creating her images in the middle of a busy @entity52 street last week			2
it is a carefully - planned ritual , which involves waiting until there is no chance of rain which could wash off the meticulously detailed designs			0
and at one point , ms @entity5 had to repaint some of her model after the owner of a van in the background got into it and drove away			2
that 's not to mention the stream of pedestrians and cab drivers who slowed down to gawk , snap pictures and ask questions - their faces a mix of shock , intrigue and anything - goes resignation			0
' it feels great to be painted , ' said model @entity87 , who wore only a bikini bottom and running shoes			2
carefully - planned : as with 3d floor paintings , when shot from any other angle the magical quality of the model 's blending into her surroundings completely vanishes finished product : ms merry with her model in front of the @entity23			0
in 1986 seven women from @entity178 , @entity9 , protested laws which allowed men to go topless but not women by holding a bare - breasted picnic in a park - which sparked a change in the law six years later , enshrining the right not to wear a top checking the results : the photographs by @entity5 have made headlines around the world with their otherworldly way of making the models blend in with the city ' you feel the transformation process			1
the brush itself , it 's really soft			0
it feels more like a massage			0
' @entity202 - by @entity203 said : ' that 's so very @entity9			2
you can not be surprised by anything			0
' @entity9 's laws allow public nudity when it is in the context of performances or artistic expression , and women are allowed to be topless , two traditions established through a string of hard - fought cases			2
in 1986 seven women from @entity178 , @entity9 , protested laws which allowed men to go topless but not women by holding a bare - breasted picnic in a park			2
the publicity around the stunt - and their hard - fought campaign afterwards - led eventually to a ruling in 1992 by the state 's highest court , the @entity221			0
one of the justices wrote : ' one of the most important purposes to be served by the equal protection clause is to ensure that " public sensibilities " grounded in prejudice and unexamined stereotypes do not become enshrined as part of the official policy of government			0
' this photo required an incredible amount of work to get the body paint dimensions perfect - the model appears almost translucent as she stands before @entity244 art imitates art : a model at the house of expressionist @entity249 , part of a famed group of @entity9 painters that included @entity253 and @entity254 freedom ! a model , her body painted to an incredible level of detail and taking on a ghost - like appearance , stands before the greys and the blues of downtown @entity2			1

@entity5 has been turning heads with her painstaking creations since moving from @entity29 earlier this year
models are painted in front of @entity24 , @entity52 and the towering grey @entity2
@entity273 , 33 , takes *advantage* of *relaxed* @entity9 laws on people baring their bodies for the purposes of art
