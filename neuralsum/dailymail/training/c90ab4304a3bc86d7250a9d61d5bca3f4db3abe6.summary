for a long time , i struggled to comprehend how @entity2 's influence had allowed him to escape the law for so long			1
then i got a call from a former officer with the @entity6			2
there was , he said , a simple explanation			2
his enormous working - class appeal left the @entity11 worried that @entity2 might be able to do something remarkable if he went to trial — win public sympathy for paedophilia			1
this sounds incredible now , but as the former police officer went on to explain : ‘ they knew how popular he was in @entity20 and thought it might backfire			2
they thought ladies in @entity20 would be offering their children up in a show of support			2
’ former @entity28 ministers @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) , plus current shadow minister @entity31 , were all recently identified by the @entity32 as senior figures in the @entity34 when it was linked to the @entity35 @entity31 attended key meetings my head was spinning at the thought			1
but if you followed this story down the rabbit hole into the @entity44 wonderland you quickly had to acknowledge there were more than a few advocates for paedophilia			1
the @entity48 and the @entity35 were two of the more high - profile liberation campaigns that sprung up at the time , seeking to reclassify paedophilia as ‘ intergenerational relationships ’			1
one of the leading members of the @entity35 was the @entity55 diplomat , sir @entity54 , who was later jailed			1
these were n’t simply loony fringe sects			2
as has been exposed by the @entity32 , they were affiliated to the @entity59 of @entity60 ( @entity34 ) , now known as @entity34 , and would pop up frequently in the media			1
part of their strategy , as their chairman @entity62 freely admitted , was to ‘ seek out as much publicity for the organisation as possible ’ and ‘ the only way to get more paedophiles joining @entity35 ’ was ‘ to make paedophilia a real public issue ’			1
they had as many as a thousand members , and were influential			2
in 1978 they sent every member of parliament a copy of their booklet , paedophilia : some @entity80			2
the national media reported on their views and the @entity34 seemed sympathetic			1
most alarmingly , a letter published in the @entity34 house magazine , rights , in 1982 , argued that more needed to be done to champion paedophile rights			1
‘ consensual sex between adults and children is simply people of different age groups being nice to each other , ’ the author claimed			2
worryingly , it seemed that a fair few on the @entity96 , including some who have subsequently become key figures in the @entity99 were fooled into giving this hideous group shelter			2
[ @entity28 ministers @entity29 and @entity30 , plus current shadow minister @entity31 , were all recently identified by the @entity32 as senior figures in the @entity34 when it was linked to @entity35 ]			1
all of which helped @entity2 ’s cause and kept him hidden from scrutiny			1
it seems unthinkable now , but groups like these tried to water down parliamentary bills which were intended to protect children from child abusers , and academics loudly championed their cause			2
@entity114 professor @entity113 was among those leading the charge of the child sex abuse lobby			0
it was ‘ unwise ’ , he argued , ‘ to over-dramatise institutional abuse ’			0
@entity2 's enormous working - class appeal left the @entity11 worried that the mp might be able to do something remarkable if he went to trial - win public sympathy for paedophilia with this sickening liberal wind behind them , it was hardly surprising that ugly networks quickly grew to protect and provide for paedophiles of a high social status			1
secret parties , underground grooming activities and vile associations all developed out of these thriving networks			0
the @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 , soon became the centre of a vip paedophile ring			0
but although it was raided by the @entity144 in 1982 , allegations of child abuse were never followed up			0
only after recent political pressure in @entity146 has a police investigation finally started to look into allegations of boys being trafficked from a nearby care home run by @entity151 , to be abused at this guest house by a paedophile ring			0
there has been much speculation as to who was part of this sordid club , but the @entity6 confirmed that @entity2 was a visitor			1
i found eyewitness proof of this when i was passed the details of someone who was forced to work at @entity136 in the early @entity163 as a masseur			0
‘ he knows all about @entity2 , ’ my source told me			1
‘ see if he ’ll speak to you			0
’ the @entity48 and the @entity35 were two of the more high - profile liberation campaigns that sprung up at the time , seeking to reclassify paedophilia as ' intergenerational relationships '			1
above , a demo outside a @entity35 meeting in 1977 the man , who was 16 at the time and understandably does n’t want to be named , answered straight away			1
‘ how did you get my number ? ’ he demanded			0
there was fear in his voice			0
he warned me of the dangers of digging too deep into what went on at @entity136			0
‘ the police told me not to say anything about it			0
you know what happened to @entity189 , do n’t you ? ’ @entity191 ran @entity136 from 1979 to 1982			0
paedophiles from all over the country would attend parties there and boys were sexually abused			0
it was raided by police in 1982 and shut down			0
years later , @entity191 threatened to expose all the people who ’d attended her parties			0
soon afterwards she was found dead of an insulin overdose			0
the fear in the former masseur ’s voice is genuine and not for the first time i wonder whether victims of abuse can ever feel safe no matter how much distance they put between themselves and their abusers			0
i learned that @entity2 had visited @entity136 several times for sessions with this 16 - year - old lad			1
he liked to receive oral sex			0
on one occasion ‘ @entity215 ’ , as he was nicknamed , got stuck in the sauna and had to be hoisted out			0
another victim has gone public to say that @entity2 had a friendship with notorious paedophile and founding member of the @entity35 , @entity217 , who co-authored a book , perspectives on @entity223 , which championed the right of adults to have sex with children			1
@entity2 was part of a bigger story and i ’m sure he was n’t the only high - profile figure , or even politician , involved in preying on and abusing young boys all over the country			1

his enormous working - class appeal left the @entity11 worried that @entity2 might win public sympathy for paedophilia
the @entity48 and the @entity35 had sprung up
the organisations were affiliated to @entity59 of @entity60 ( @entity34 ) , now known as @entity34
