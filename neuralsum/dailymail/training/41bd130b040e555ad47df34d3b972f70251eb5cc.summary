a single plucky porcupine fought off the unwelcome attention of 17 lions after they surrounded him at night in the open savannah			1
the prickly animal was caught in the open by the pride on the @entity8 in @entity9 , which is a private reserve bordering the vast @entity11			1
but it was clear he was not prepared to become a light snack ( with integral toothpicks ) for the hungry lions and used his quills to fight them off			1
footage of the remarkable battle was uploaded to @entity20 by workers at the @entity8 reserve last week and has already been viewed more than 100,000 times			1
keeper @entity24 described the sequence of events on the @entity8 reserve 's blog			1
the @entity30 pride had been resting all afternoon , he said , until night fell and it began to cool			2
' the pride soon became active and started to move with the four male lions in tow			2
suddenly we saw the group clump together and it looked like they were surrounding something of interest			0
' when he caught up with the pride he found they had encircled a tiny porcupine and were beginning to prod and paw at it , to see how they could take a bite			2
' all was not lost however and the porcupine began to shake its tail ( known as a rattle ) â€“ the sound of the quills makes a distracting noise , ' said mr @entity24			0
' the porcupine began to run backwards into any lion that would come too close for comfort , a common defense mechanism for a threatened porcupine			0
' @entity59 ' quills are fused hairs coated with thick plates of keratin , and they are embedded in the skin musculature			0
they are released by contact with a predator who gets too close , causing pain and potentially leading to an infection			0
@entity70 porcupines like the one in the video are found across @entity9 and as far north as @entity72			1
they weigh between 30lb and 60lb and their entire bodies are covered with bristles			0
they also have a mane of quills running along their heads , napes and backs that can be raised into a crest for protection			0
if bothered by predators , a crested porcupine stamps its feet , shake its quills and charge rear end first to try to stab its enemy with its crest			0
they are known to have killed lions , leopards , hyenas and even humans .			1
