by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 20:31 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:31 est , 29 december 2013 as her beloved daughter lay dying two years ago , @entity4 asked doctors to do something other parents might consider unthinkable : ' at least save her organs '			1
it 's a decision the cardiac nurse does not regret			2
she tragically lost her ' baby ' , but four organ recipients are now alive thanks to @entity17 's body parts			1
during the worst weekend of her life , @entity4 agreed to let the @entity19 follow her and watch the recovery of her daughter 's organs in a bid to raise awareness about donations			1
heartbreaking : @entity4 holds her daughter @entity27 's hand one last time before she is taken to an operating room to have her organs recovered @entity4 's 31 - year - old daughter @entity17 suffered a massive stroke in april 2011			1
@entity17 was rushed to hospital and placed on life support			2
but the swelling in the young mom 's brain spread quickly and soon blood seeped into the right side			2
@entity17 had a seven - year - old daughter , @entity37			1
almost two days after @entity17 's horrific stroke , a doctor pronounced her brain dead			1
it was about 12.45pm on a monday			0
that 's when @entity43 , 58 , made the toughest decision of her life - to donate @entity17 's organs			1
leaning over her daughter , pressing the young woman 's hand against her wet cheek , she whispered : ' you did good , honey			2
you 're going to help so many people			0
' @entity4 had worked on transplant cases at @entity55 , where her daughter was now on life support			1
she knew how many people were waiting for organs , hoping to get a second chance			2
anyone who dies could save eight lives : two kidneys , two lungs , liver , pancreas , small intestine and heart			0
more than 50 more people might benefit if skin and tissue are also donated			2
grieving : a picture of a horse , colored by her six - year - old daughter @entity37 , was placed in the casket with @entity17 , 31 , during her funeral service meanwhile , outside in the hospital hall , a transplant team was assembling and specialists began streaming into the room			1
each organ had its own support team , with more than 100 people working on each donor			2
@entity19 reported that doctors worked frantically to test @entity17 's organs			1
a pulmonologist threaded a scope down @entity17 's throat to search her lungs for signs of pneumonia before wrapping a white vest around her chest to stop the build - up of secretions			1
a kidney surgeon ordered blood tests to check for infection as a cardiologist took an ultrasound of @entity17 's heart			1
hearts have to be working at a level of at least 50 percent to be transplanted			0
@entity17 's was at 35			1
preparation : @entity17 's liver is cleaned , packaged and kept on ice for the team of doctors that will transplant it into an awaiting recipient at the nurses ' station , two @entity113 workers added @entity17 's age , height , weight and blood type to a database called @entity121 to identify suitable organ recipients			1
' it takes such difficult coordination to keep all these organs viable , then to get them all placed , ' dr. @entity123 , the pulmonologist , said			2
' and once the recipients are found , they have to be called in for pre- op. so we have to know where each organ is going before we recover it			2
' specialists began the search for suitable recipients about 4.15pm by logging onto local waiting lists , starting with the sickest and those who 'd waited the longest			0
kidneys can be transplanted up to 36 hours after recovery and flown all the way across the country , while eyes and tissue can be shipped overseas			2
on the third query about the liver , match specialists found a recipient close enough to drive to @entity55			0
on the fourth call for the kidney , they connected with a man nearby who had been waiting three years			0
the surgery was a success			0
heartbreaking : while in the hospital room , @entity4 taped a picture of @entity17 's six - year - old daughter , @entity37 , over her heart after they had called 70 hospitals in @entity161 about the lungs and pancreas , the specialists started widening their range , 500 miles at a time			1
by midnight , the two women had logged more than 300 calls , texts and emails			0
just before 9am tuesday , the transplant coordinator said surgeons declined @entity17 's heart			1
too much time had passed			0
for @entity4 , it was as if @entity17 had died all over again			1
once the heart stops , lungs have to be transplanted within four hours , livers within 12			0
kidneys can last two days			0
bones and skin can be stored for two years			0
@entity43 leaned over her daughter 's body , wiped each closed lid with her thumb and whispered , ' i love you '			1
' she will always be my baby ' : when cardiac nurse @entity4 's 31 - year - old daughter , @entity17 , passed away the decision to donate her organs was a priority - as a way to find a bright spot in a tragedy at 12.30pm , doctors removed @entity17 's three - pound liver			1
one specialist ran a cold preservation solution through the organ to flush the warm blood and slow metabolism			0
then they doused the liver in a bowl of clear saline slush before it was packaged in a bag with crushed ice			0
in three hours , the team preserved the liver , one lung and both kidneys			0
specialists could n't find a match for the pancreas or small intestine , so they left them intact			0
in the end , four organs were recovered which meant the lives of four strangers had been saved			0
' oh , that 's wonderful ! ' @entity4 sobbed			1
' i want to meet them			0
i want my granddaughter to meet them too , to see the people her mommy helped			0
' i want to tell them about @entity17			2
