@entity1 fans are all doing a jig by the @entity3 right now			1
they have just been given a gift for @entity5 and a @entity6 all in one			1
i do n't know one @entity1 fan who wanted @entity9 to stay , so they are delighted @entity11 have obliged and taken him off their hands			1
but there is a downside to this that must surely hurt even the most passionate member of the @entity9 brigade			0
@entity19 has left @entity1 for relegation - threatened @entity11 @entity9 's decision to leave @entity21 will make the majority of @entity1 fans happy @entity1 's stock is low			1
as a football club its standing is tumbling down to what could be an all - time low			0
i 'm not talking about league position – i 'm talking about how the club is viewed globally			0
it 's clear they are not one of the big boys			0
it 's clear that under @entity37 's guardianship @entity1 are also - rans at best , and certainly not a club that 's likely to attract a top manager			1
tyneside times are so hard right now , that a third - rate manager has chosen to extricate himself from the remaining six years of his contract , despite the fact that atrocious results and a truly appalling record in the @entity50 and @entity49 suggested there was no imminent indication he was likely to get the sack			2
to make it even worse , @entity9 has n't been tempted by @entity56 or @entity57			0
@entity1 under owner @entity37 ( pictured ) are also - rans at best the stadium is one of the worst in the @entity61 , the budget was so bad even @entity62 chose unemployment rather than stay there , and there 's far more likelihood @entity11 will be heading down to the championship rather than @entity1			1
and yet @entity9 would rather be in @entity68 than the north east			0
of course there may be other reasons for this switch			0
reasons which have yet to emerge			0
but from the information we have it is a move from @entity9 which shows that @entity1 is not an attractive proposition			2
around a year ago he enjoyed a run of seven wins in nine at @entity1			2
they were flying , and playing some great football			0
but then @entity82 was sold against the manager 's wishes , he was n't replaced and @entity1 's season fell apart			1
@entity82 was sold against @entity9 's wishes as @entity1 were enjoying a purple patch @entity82 was sold to @entity89 giants @entity88 in a deal worth £ 19million and the truth is this : unless you have something special as a manager ( in his 10 years of management @entity9 has n't shown us anything yet – he 's been decent and no more ) , there is little chance of success at @entity1			1
the ' buy cheap – sell big ' policy at @entity1 works from a business point of view , but leaves success - starved fans frustrated			1
and there are plenty of them : 52,000 crazed @entity1 packing the stadium out every home game , and a passionate away following			0
@entity9 applauds the fans after @entity1 beat @entity110 3 - 2 on december 28 , his last game in charge they must be overjoyed @entity9 has left			1
but at the same time it 's confirmation of what some of us have believed for a little while now – the only thing big about @entity1 is the support of the fans			2
fairplay to @entity11 for getting the man they wanted			0
but to see that manager choose @entity11 rather than stay at @entity124 shows just how far @entity1 have sunk as a club under the current regime .			2

@entity19 leaving is a @entity5 gift for @entity1 supporters
@entity1 's image globally means they wo n't attract a top manager
under @entity37 's guardianship @entity136 are seen as also - rans at best
