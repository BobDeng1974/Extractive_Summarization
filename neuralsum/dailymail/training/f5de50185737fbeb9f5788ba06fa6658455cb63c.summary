@entity1 ski operators could pull out of @entity3 resorts en masse as a new minimum wage law is set to be passed this week			1
the @entity3 government is expected to approve an amendment to the @entity7 on thursday , ensuring that non-resident workers be paid the same wages as @entity3 employees			0
the changes to the act would be enforced from january 1 , 2015 - midway through the imminent season			0
ski companies face substantial losses if a new @entity3 minimum wage law comes into effect on january 1 foreign travel companies will have to pay employees a minimum wage of approximately 1,000 euros - around £ 800 - per month , and will face fines of up to 10,000 euros ( around £ 8,000 ) per employee if they do not adhere to the amended legislation , rising to 20,000 euros ( around £ 16,000 ) for more than three employees or if it is a recurring violation			2
the operators currently are able to pay staff lower hourly wages because their salary packages often include accommodation and food , flights , insurance , ski hire and passes , as well as compensation for working over holidays and evening shifts			2
with the ski season kicking off in the next couple of weeks , companies including @entity40 , who manage nine chalets in @entity3 , will be forced to absorb the loss in profit if the changes come into effect on january 1 , with ski holidays already sold and staff employed for the 2014/15 season			2
@entity51 , co-founder of @entity52 , told @entity53 : ' these highly damaging proposals would lead to a large increase in employment costs , which could see the cost of a family ski holiday to @entity3 rise by up to £ 140 , jeopardising @entity3 's position as a value destination			1
ski resort staff are often paid lower wages , but given accommodation , food , flights and ski passes @entity1 operator @entity52 are fighting the changes , saying the cost of a family holiday could rise by £ 140 ' we are working with other ski operators to challenge these plans which , if passed , will affect the viability of providing good value chalet holidays in @entity3 and would hurt the @entity3 tourism industry immensely			1
' similiar legislation changes in @entity78 in 2013 resulted in a number of major @entity1 ski operators pulling out of the region , with mainly high - end chalets remaining , where the wage increase could be absorbed			1
the affected chalets were allowed to continue paying staff previously - agreed wages throughout the 2013/14 season			0
many of the chalet operators did not renew contracts for this season			0
of the @entity78 legislation , @entity98 , of holiday firm @entity92 and its sister companies @entity95 and @entity96 told @entity100 last month : ‘ there are no winners with this legislation			0

@entity7 could come into effect on january 1
cost of a family holiday could a rise by up to £ 140 as a result
staff paid lower wages along with accommodation , flights and ski passes
many @entity1 ski operators pulled out of @entity78 after law changes
