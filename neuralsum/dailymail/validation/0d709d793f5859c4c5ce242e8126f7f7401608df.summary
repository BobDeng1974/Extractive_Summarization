@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes captaincy is bringing the best out of team - mate @entity4			1
in the absence of @entity8 , who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury which has sidelined him for six matches , the @entity6 vice-captain has taken the armband and led from the front			1
his goal against @entity15 was his second in as many games - taking his tally for the season to five - and he also provided his 11th assist of the season for @entity21 to also score against the @entity15			2
@entity4 ( centre ) has seen @entity1 unbeaten in his six games as captain @entity4 scored a stunning goal in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity15 on wednesday the @entity27 international also scored a screamer against champions @entity30 in his previous game @entity1 have not lost any of the 13 matches in which @entity4 has worn the armband from the start and @entity0 , who knows something about leadership from his time at @entity39 , believes his @entity27 colleague has grown with the added responsibility			1
he has matured as a player over the last two seasons and he has kicked on another level even with the armband , ' said the Â£ 23million summer signing			1
' i was lucky enough to be captain at @entity39 and it does give you that little bit extra and it seems it is doing the same to him			0
' it is great to be playing with such good players and the results are on the up			0
' we have a great rhythm and a good bit of consistency and are keeping clean sheets as well ; we 've turned a corner since @entity61 and we are really looking good			0
@entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity4 has come into his own after being handed the @entity6 armband first choice captain @entity8 ( right ) has returned to training after recovering from a hamstring injury ' it was a difficult start ( to the season ) but all the signings have bedded in now and we have players back fit and we have found a system we are playing really well and are causing teams problems			1
' confidence is a big thing in any team and we have that in abundance and i think it is showing			2
' @entity0 's own improvement in form has also taken an upturn in line with the team 's and there is no doubt he is benefiting from the 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 system which allows him the freedom , alongside @entity86 , to exploit the space behind the central striker			1
' i 've had a few injuries and been in and out of the team for whatever reason but i am thoroughly enjoying it at the minute , ' he added			2
' i am staying fit and contributing in the system the manager has got us playing			0
' @entity21 scores against @entity97 to set up an @entity99 quarter - final against @entity100 on sunday with @entity1 now at full pelt in the race for the top four , just three points behind third - placed @entity105 , they must now divert their attention to the @entity99			1
@entity108 side @entity100 visit @entity109 on sunday with a place in the last four at stake			0
' it is a great competition in which we have a great chance of getting to @entity115 in the semi-final , ' said @entity0			2
' we wo n't underestimate @entity100 , we will dust ourselves down , recover well and go again sunday			0
' a lot of the big guns went out in the early rounds so it is good that we can maybe capitalise on that but @entity100 will not be an easy game			0
