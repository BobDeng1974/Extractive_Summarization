by @entity1 reporter published : 11:13 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 23:43 est , 9 may 2012 @entity3 's lawyers say the actor was in @entity5 on the date a male masseur is accusing him of sexual assault in @entity9			1
and they believe that new evidence of a restaurant receipt and a photograph of the actor proves it			0
a receipt from a meal the @entity16 actor ate at mr. @entity17 in @entity5 on january 16 , 2012 , has now emerged , the same day he is alleged to have sexually harassed an anonymous masseur in a @entity20 hotel			1
photographic evidence : lawyers for @entity3 claim that this photo taken of the actor on the 16th of january this year in @entity5 clears him of sexual assault allegations the receipt , obtained by @entity26 , allegedly shows that the actor dined at the famous eatery and was presented with a check late in the evening			1
he paid a bill of $ 382.69 for the meal , as well as a $ 100 tip. however , @entity31 , the lawyer representing both alleged victims - who are each seeking $ 2million in damages - states that the receipt does not prove much			1
he said : ' the credit card receipt that mr. @entity3 says proves he was in @entity5 has a time stamp of 11:38p.m			1
, our complaint clearly says the assault occurred in the morning of january 16			0
' this credit card receipt proves absolutely nothing , and it does n't account for the day of january 16			0
my client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m. @entity3 could make it to @entity5 on horseback in that time			1
' the @entity16 actor , who has described the sexual assault claims as ' baseless ' , was also photographed in @entity5 on january 16th			1
@entity5 dining : a receipt from a meal the @entity16 actor ate at mr. @entity17 in @entity5 on the same day has also emerged it is claimed by @entity26 that two photos show him first at 4:30p.m			1
and then again at 5:21p.m			0
, at a fitting for his upcoming movie @entity54			0
yesterday a second man filed a lawsuit claiming the actor tried to grab his penis during a massage session on january 28 in @entity61 , @entity62 but @entity3 's attorney @entity63 has denied both claims , and states he can prove not only that his client was in @entity5 on january 16 but that he was there the day before as well			1
@entity31 claims there are over 100 other men prepared to come forward with similar stories about the ' @entity71 ' star			1
he told @entity72 : ' by the time this case is over @entity63 will have to accuse more than 100 men of lying because i have been contacted by people , mostly men , that have first hand information about similar behaviour on @entity3 's part to that contained in the lawsuits i have already filed against him			1
' i have witnesses and the potential for more accusers in virtually every state of the union who have called me			0
' i 'm currently in the process of investigating their claims and verifying the information before possible further action is taken			0
' in response to mr. @entity63 who said he will take legal action - not only against the claimant , but also the claimant 's lawyer - for malicious prosecution , @entity31 said : ' if @entity63 thinks he can sue me on the validity of mr. @entity3 's denials , and if he wants to file the lawsuit now , i will give him a waiver allowing him to proceed with it at this stage of the case , even though under @entity108 law he has to wait until he wins the case , and that absolutely wo n't be happening			1
it will never happen , he wo n't win , so we might as well get it over with now			0
lawsuit : @entity3 , pictured with wife @entity116 , is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards two male massage therapists yesterday in a statement , a spokesman for the actor , who fully denies the initial sexual battery lawsuit , said : ' this lawsuit is a complete fiction and fabrication			1
none of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred			0
' the plaintiff , who refuses to give their name , knows that the suit is a baseless lie			0
it is for that reason that the plaintiff has n't been identified with a name , even though it is required to do so			0
' on the date when plaintiff claims @entity3 met him , @entity3 was not in @entity108 , and it can be proved that he was on the @entity141			1
@entity143 's attorney has filed this suit to try and get his 15 minutes of fame			0
@entity3 intends to get this case thrown out , and then he will sue the attorney and plaintiff for malicious prosecution			2
' happily married : travolta with wife @entity116 on april 25th as they left @entity155 's 70th birthday party and two days before the first alleged incident on january 16th , they appeared at the @entity158 event according to @entity72 , the second accuser claims to have ' substantial documentation and numerous witnesses regarding the substance of @entity3 's actions			1
' @entity3 's lawyer @entity63 has branded the accusation just ' as absurd and ridiculous as the first one '			1
@entity63 also revealed he will take legal action - not only against the claimant , but also the claimant 's lawyer - for malicious prosecution			2
denial : @entity3 , on the set of his latest film @entity172 in @entity9 last year , will fight the case , according to his lawyer he told the hollywood reporter : ' there is a heightened standard for a lawyer suing a celebrity and knowing the media will pick it up			1
the lawyer ca n't just rely on the client			0
he needs to do an investigation and has an obligation to do due diligence			0
' whispers about @entity3 ’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset			2
various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen in the musical @entity71 – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay			0
but there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image			0
they include rumours that his 1991 marriage to @entity116 was arranged by the shadowy cult - like religion of @entity206 , of which he is a leading disciple			0
seven years later , the father - of - two @entity3 was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the @entity210			1
the case never got a hearing , however			0
and in 2001 , @entity3 faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club			1
however , the rumour mill reached a crescendo in 2006 , when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own @entity221 jet in @entity222			0
@entity3 has always maintained he is not worried by rumours surrounding his sexuality , insisting ' i do n't think anyone can hurt me			2
' according to the the second accuser 's lawsuit , which was filed on tuesday morning in @entity230 in @entity9 , the victim alleges that while working at an unspecified resort in @entity61 , @entity62 on january 28 , 2012 , he did an in - room massage on @entity3			1
according to the documents , @entity3 was staying on the 15th floor of the high - end resort , and he was referred to as mr. @entity236			1
the documents claim that the plaintiff ' does n't normally do in - room massages and asked a co-worker to take the assignment , but he declined because @entity3 has been banned from a spa that the coworker used to work at in @entity9			2
' on the morning of the massage @entity3 is said to have had ' a strange demeanour , bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the already setup massage table '			2
the lawsuit continues : ' @entity3 removed the entire sheet from his body , and he claimed the sheets were sticky and could not tolerate the heat			2
@entity3 further indicated that he likes a lot of " @entity257 " work meaning a massage on his buttocks			2
' the plaintiff also alleges that @entity3 began masturbating after attempting to get him to touch his ' scrotum , upper thighs and buttocks '			2
in the first incident , @entity3 allegedly claimed that he got his first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while starring in the 1975 tv series @entity266			2
the plaintiff , or accuser - who refuses to be named because his lawyer claims he is frightened of the @entity270 powerhouse - alleges that mr @entity3 picked him up in his black @entity271 after a anonymous phone appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot in a nearby street			1
second accuser : court papers have been amended since another masseur has claimed sexual battery by the star @entity281 : the second masseur stated that @entity3 booked an appointment under the name ' mr @entity236 ' same month : the second accuser claims the incident took place during an in - room massage in @entity61 , @entity62 on january 28 during the journey , the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle , after pulling up outside the @entity295 , they are then said to have entered one of the business 's annexes opposite the main building , which are known as bungalows			1
they were then greeted by an ' overweight ' black man who was grilling hamburgers			0
this chef is then said to have disappeared when mr @entity3 allegedly tried to have sex with the male masseur			2
the masseur is seeking more than $ 2million in damages			0
' fiction ' a spokesperson for @entity3 has hit out at the claims , even claiming that @entity3 was not in @entity9 at the time - though he was pictured at a @entity158 event with his wife two days earlier witness : the plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage , which passed without incident serious allegations : @entity3 is absolutely refuting that he was even in @entity9 at the time of the alleged incident @entity322 , who is also representing the first masseur told @entity72 : ' my client is afraid of @entity3			1
he added : ' mr. @entity3 made very explicit threats against my client , which are contained in the lawsuit			0
' specifically , @entity3 told my client that @entity270 is controlled by homosexual @entity329 men who expect favours in return for sexual activity			2
' let 's face it , @entity3 is an extremely powerful man , and my client absolutely felt threatened by mr. @entity3			0
my client was sexually assaulted by mr. @entity3 and he needs to be held accountable for his actions			0
