' i ca n't remember seeing anything that could have tipped the digger over , ' he added			2
@entity57 officer @entity56 said no defects were found in the mini-excavator machine that could have contributed to mr @entity0 's death			1
he said marks had been found on the back wall which were ' consistent with the machine coming backwards and rolling onto its side '			0
the vehicle 's centre of gravity was quite far back , meaning it could tip over in this way , mr @entity56 said			2
it was not clear whether mr @entity0 had tried to jump clear of the digger or been thrown from it before being pinned down by the roll bar - a protective device			1
mr @entity56 said : ' there are two scenarios and it is impossible to say			0

you think you can jump clear			0

senior coroner @entity105 said : ' i can see from these photographs , it is quite an achievement for it [ the digger ] to end up like this			2
' by some means or other it 's toppled over and crushed him			2
' mr @entity105 said it was ' impossible to disentangle ' if mr @entity0 had undone his seatbelt to jump out or if he had simply not been wearing one and been thrown out of the digger			1
