by @entity0 @entity1 has witnessed first - hand how both men and women fuel sexism at @entity5 scandal - ridden ‘ drinking societies ’ at @entity9 and @entity5 universities have been around for centuries – but their reputations have never been lower			1
one study has suggested almost half of female students at @entity5 have reported being groped , pinched or touched , a drinking society from the same university has been filmed marching down a street chanting ‘ rape ’ , and a boycott row has engulfed the @entity19 whose president is accused of rape			1
i learned about these elite societies during my days as a naive , unworldly fresher at @entity5 when i dated one of their members			1
the evidence was all around me in drinking games that entertained men but demeaned women			1
yet so many women – particularly those new to university – agreed to take part			2
most recently there has been ‘ whaling ’ , where young men compete to find , bed and ‘ harpoon ’ the ugliest girl in a bar or club			1
then there is @entity45 , where boys grab a curvaceous young woman , threaten to rape her , and hang on as long as they can as she desperately tries to throw them off			1
thank goodness i ’ve never been a victim of either of these ‘ games ’ , though their existence proves that drinking societies remain puerile and disgusting , and often regard women as playthings who exist merely for sex and entertainment			1
sadly , my fellow females do n’t seem to be doing much better			0
while male societies call themselves @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , or the speakers , female societies include the harlots , the @entity67 , @entity68 , and a host of other innuendo - derived titles			1
the names tell you everything you need to know about the sexism , attitudes and expectations that define drinking societies as much as they define current student culture			1
the girls who meet these expectations are the girls , already blinded by alcohol , who stand up and confess to such things as taking part in a threesome or sleeping with a lecturer and are then given a ‘ drinking fine ’ – an alcoholic drink as punishment			1
why do the women admit to these things , or agree to spend an evening dressed in tiny pink hotpants and a sports bra ; or allow guys they ’ve known for three hours to drink tequila shots out of their belly button as they lie submissively on a curry - strewn table ? female students at @entity5 lick cream off the bodies of male students in a raucous drinking game high jinks : these games have affected the reputations of @entity9 and @entity5 more than ever before one explanation may be that , for that moment , when you stand half - naked on top of a table and down whatever lethal alcoholic concoction you ’ve been given , you ’re the centre of attention			1
you ’re accepted as one of the party people and something exclusive to the ‘ cool kids ’ at university , which is what you want to be			0
in fact , you are merely part of the show			0
the next morning you wake up , mortified that you exposed your slightly too flabby @entity119 holiday stomach to the diners at @entity121 with a horrible awareness that you ’ve successfully and simultaneously established yourself as both a ‘ good - time girl ’ and a complete idiot			1
would you want future employers seeing your behaviour ? or your mother ? would you even want a photo up on @entity129 ? then there are traditions such as the @entity133 ’s one of sending anonymous invitations to a dubiously selected handful of first - year girls			1
there was also uproar over the actions of @entity140 at @entity9 , who invited the college ’s prettiest freshers to a ‘ fox hunt ’ where they would dress as foxes and be hunted by drunken and predatory males			1
it was cancelled after provoking a furore			0
such activities feed the public a damaging image of our universities			1
the @entity133 , @entity156 and the notorious @entity157 at @entity9 present a picture of smug , self - regarding students revelling in port , cigars and striped bow ties			1
all of them are male			0
of course , there are double standards			0
it goes without saying that a banterous twentysomething , bow tie - sporting male student can take his top off and chant loudly while downing a bottle of wine without raising an eyebrow			2
when you strip down and drink lethal alcoholic concoctions , you 're accepted as one of the party people but for a female student to do the same thing is quite a different matter			2
some women might shrug off the resulting stigma or the ‘ reputation ’ they have sprouted overnight			0
but what about the rest of us ? such sexist antics – and the women who are lured into indulging them – make it hard for us to be taken seriously in the country ’s leading seats of learning			0
it is too easy to say , ‘ if you do n’t want to do it , then do n’t ’			0
there are occasions when @entity198 and many of my friends have done exactly that			0
we ’ve watched while our peers have stripped or downed dubious - looking alcoholic beverages believing ‘ it ’s just a bit of fun ’			2
but the consequences for all young women can be much more serious			0
i have one friend who now refuses to socialise with a college drinking society having once been encouraged by them to strip and show off her slightly larger - than - average breasts to the rest of the room			2
they think women exist purely for sex i have another friend who continually worries about her ‘ reputation ’ preceding her on the rare occasions when she goes on proper dates after she earned herself the nickname ‘ the college bench - press ’			2
these girls could have said no , but the peer - pressure surrounding them would almost definitely have subsequently labelled them as that worst of all epithets – boring			1
@entity230 drinking societies are marked by stories like these			2
scarily , they are regarded as normal			0
they are also ‘ normal ’ across the rest of the country			0
go to @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 or any other university in the country and you will find some sexist behaviour in the university ’s drinking culture			2
it ’s become a given in an age where websites such as @entity250 have more than 500,000 likes on @entity129 , and in which ‘ fancy - dress ’ is code for women wearing as little as possible			2
yet what makes this sexism worse for @entity230 women is our sense of injustice			0
it is not fair that , having been at these universities for almost as long as some of their most famous drinking societies ( the @entity133 was founded in 1830 , women started at @entity5 in 1869 ) , we are not given the same social opportunities			1
women have been attending @entity5 ( @entity268 pictured ) since 1869 and yet sexism prevails the member of the elite drinking club i dated went to £ 80 - a - head dinners			1
he met influential , interesting , talented and clever men from all over the world , purely because they were ‘ old boys ’			2
he built up a hefty network of contacts that guaranteed that he would be safe from unemployment			0
have i been given any of these opportunities ? of course not			0
am i going to be ? not unless i ’m a scantily clad guest of one of these drinking society dinners			0
where is the @entity286 at @entity5 ? or the @entity287 at @entity9 ? at @entity5 there is the @entity289 and @entity290			1
however , the former is a very small group named after the classicist @entity293 and the latter is better known for having members that are very good at finding boyfriends from among the upper echelons of the university rugby team			0
do n’t get me wrong			0
i do n’t want young women to emulate the scandalous behaviour of the boys			0
in fact most of us at university would simply prefer that their wild nights of drinking did n’t have to involve us .			0
