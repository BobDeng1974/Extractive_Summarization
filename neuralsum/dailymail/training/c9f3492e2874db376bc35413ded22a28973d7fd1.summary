by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 21:10 est , 12 november 2012 @entity1 said @entity2 would send ¿ a very dangerous message ¿ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation state regulation of newspapers would set ‘ an extraordinarily dangerous precedent ’ that would send a message ‘ around the world ’ that press freedom was n’t worth fighting for , a senior mp warned last night			1
@entity1 , chairman of the influential @entity14 , said @entity2 would send ‘ a very dangerous message ’ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation			1
in one of the most hard - hitting warnings regarding the @entity20 to date , mr @entity1 said a demand for new laws could encourage autocrats to erode hard - won freedoms around the world			1
he told a @entity27 conference in @entity28 that newspapers ’ efforts to draw up a more robust self - regulatory system , under the stewardship of @entity34 chairman @entity33 , should be given a chance to work			1
that would see papers sign binding contracts to adhere to a much tougher regime to settle complaints , with large fines for those who break the rules			0
crucially , it would avoid passing laws to underpin a new regulator that would ultimately give politicians a way of meddling with press freedom			2
the @entity50 mp warned that the introduction of state regulation in the @entity53 could start a domino effect in other nations			1
‘ i think there is a real danger of that , ’ he said			2
‘ it would set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent			0
it sends a very dangerous message elsewhere			0
‘ there is no question that this country is seen as a real beacon of freedom , something that we should be immensely proud of			0
‘ for the @entity53 to set a precedent in establishing a government body with some involvement and influence over the press i feel would give a green light to all those other countries which would say , “ well if the @entity53 can do it , the place where parliamentary democracy was formed , the place where the @entity80 was written , then clearly it is ok and we can do the same ”			1
’ he added : ‘ this is being watched around the world and may well be followed if we go down that road			2
’ barrister @entity86 , @entity87 , an expert in media law , told the conference that @entity91 ’s appointment of @entity2 to head the inquiry into press standards was a mistake			2
he said he was surprised the judge was given the job since he is a criminal lawyer , rather than an expert in libel , defamation and privacy law			0
media law expert @entity86 , @entity87 , questioned @entity2 's appointment as he is a criminal lawyer , rather than an expert in libel , defamation and privacy law ‘ he is a criminal lawyer – all his instincts will be to regulate , to look back at something that has gone wrong , ’ he said			0
@entity108 , executive director of the @entity109 who has drawn up the alternative to statutory regulation , told the conference @entity2 should give editors six months to prove the beefed - up watchdog would ‘ be the scourge of bad journalism ’			1
@entity117 , editor of the @entity118 and the new president of the @entity120 , said even the ‘ dab ’ of statute that campaigners are demanding would affect freedom of expression			1
‘ that dab would be only the start – in time the screws would be turned , ’ he said			2
‘ that would eventually remove a precious freedom that we should cherish			0
the liberty of the @entity73 is the birthright of a @entity134			1
not the birthright of newspaper owners , or editors , or journalists – it is the birthright of every citizen			0
if that is extinguished it may be that some small sections of society will celebrate but over time the vast majority of the public will be the losers			0
’ @entity2 is expected to report back later this month or early in december .			0

laws governing the press are a threat to democracy , says @entity1
self - regulation must be given a chance , he adds
@entity118 editor : ' @entity157 is the birthright of a @entity134 '
other *members* of the @entity14 warned it would be ‘ *bonkers* ’ to *impose* statutory regulation on the @entity73 while leaving the *internet* and @entity165 users *unrestrained* . @entity50 mp @entity167 said : ‘ if there is no way of bringing @entity165 and the like into line it makes it *absolutely* *ridiculous* to start talking about statutory regulation of the newspaper *industry* . ’
