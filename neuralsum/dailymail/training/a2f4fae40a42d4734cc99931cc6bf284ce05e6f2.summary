@entity2 has become the biggest magnet for migrants in @entity5 , @entity1 officials revealed yesterday			1
the highest total recorded – 590,950 – came to live here in 2010 , their figures showed			1
this intake was more than twice the 251,159 migrants who opted to go to @entity11			0
it means that this country has overtaken @entity14 and @entity15 , where levels fell sharply , as the top target for immigrants seeking jobs and a new home			1
the rise in numbers coming here marks a historic immigration landmark and comes as a new wave of incomers from @entity27 and @entity28 is expected in 2014			1
immigration : the highest total of migrants recorded - 590,950 - came to live in @entity2 in 2010 , figures have revealed @entity33 has declined to publish its estimates of how many will come then			1
for decades , @entity15 has had higher immigration levels than @entity2 while @entity14 ’s rates shot ahead ten years ago as its boom drew millions from @entity14 - speaking @entity39			1
@entity11 immigration dropped below @entity2 levels in the 1990s			2
but the latest analysis by @entity43 , the @entity1 statistics arm , indicated that economic collapse in @entity14 and tighter controls in @entity15 have made @entity2 the main destination for migrants from @entity5 and elsewhere			1
the comparisons cover 2010 but the @entity2 is likely to have retained top place in the immigration table			1
latest figures show there were 536,000 long - term immigrants to @entity2 in the year to april 2012			1
@entity33 has declined to publish its estimates of how many migrants will come from @entity27 and @entity28 in 2014 the level is far ahead of likely totals for @entity14 and @entity15 , despite the efforts of the @entity59 to cut the numbers of unskilled foreign workers			1
its limited success in this may be further highlighted next year when @entity1 legislation allows @entity27 and @entity28 the unfettered right to live and work in @entity2			1
@entity15 cities facing less pressure from immigration than their @entity2 counterparts have already complained of the impact of migrants from the two @entity75 countries			1
yesterday , the @entity76 reported that they have warned chancellor @entity77 about ‘ significant costs of poverty migration ’ and a risk to ‘ social peace ’			0
think - tank @entity82 warned that restricting the impact of immigration here is going to be a major headache for ministers			0
its chairman , sir @entity89 , said : ‘ these figures are yet another indicator showing that @entity92 lost control of immigration			0
our mass immigration far exceeds that of all the other major countries in @entity5			0
‘ the government is making huge efforts to get the numbers under control but it is not going to be easy given that @entity2 has become the destination of choice in @entity5			2
’ immigration into @entity2 was running at just over 300,000 a year until rising under @entity92 in 1997			0
@entity107 passed 400,000 in 2003 and 500,000 in 2004 when the borders were opened to workers from @entity110 and eight other @entity1 countries			0
@entity15 , @entity14 and almost all other @entity1 countries put curbs on @entity75 workers			1
@entity2 officials predicted that only 13,000 @entity110 would arrive but , in fact , more than a million did so and @entity117 is now this country ’s second most common language			0
@entity15 cities have already been warning chancellor @entity77 ( pictured ) of the impact of migrants from @entity28 and @entity27 @entity106 peaked in 2010 and dropped to 566,000 in 2011			1
full figures for 2012 have not yet been published			0
after coming to power in 2010 , the @entity59 promised to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year			0
but ministers have struggled to reduce this statistic , which measures how migration increases the population after immigration and emigration have been counted			0
‘ the government is making huge efforts to get the numbers under control but it is not going to be easy given that @entity2 has become the destination of choice in @entity5 ’ - sir @entity89 , chairman of think - tank @entity82 the figure fell from 252,000 in 2010 to 183,000 at the latest count			2
however , it is still well above net migration in @entity15 , whose population swelled by 151,600 in 2010			2
that year , @entity14 ’s net immigration was just 62,200 as 400,000 quit its collapsing economy			0
@entity43 said immigration restrictions had been a success across much of the @entity1			0
limits focused on attracting specific migrants to combat skills shortages , based on language proficiency , work experience , education and age			0
it added : ‘ significant resources have been mobilised to fight people smuggling and trafficking			0
’ the figures reveal how the dramatic fall in migration to @entity14 and @entity15 began in 2009 as the recession began to bite			1
in @entity15 , it fell from 682,000 in 2008 to 404,000 in 2010			2
in @entity14 , it fell from a peak of 958,000 in 2007 to 465,000 in 2010			2
the impact of immigration to @entity2 was underlined by the 2011 census , which showed the population was 63.2million , half a million more than expected			2
there were four million immigrants in a decade , whose arrival helped push the population of @entity175 and @entity176 up by 3.7 million .			0
