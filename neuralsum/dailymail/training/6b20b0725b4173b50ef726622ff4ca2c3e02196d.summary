the cultivation of an exotic spice worth more per ounce than gold has returned to @entity4 for the first time in 200 years after a farmer decided to revive the centuries - old tradition of producing saffron			1
farmer @entity9 was inspired to start producing the spice after discovering a crocus plant in his garden , and his produce is now being sold in prestigious @entity15 grocers @entity17 and @entity16			1
growing the spice was once a popular practice in @entity20 , but died out because the painstaking harvesting methods became too expensive to compete with cheap saffron imported from remote @entity23 and @entity24			1
with a gram , 0.035 of an ounce , of the sought - after spice selling for up to £ 75 , saffron is more expensive than gold because harvesting it is so laborious			1
each crocus flower yields just three stigmas which are picked by hand by an army of volunteers then dried to create the precious saffron strands			1
mr @entity9 , who is one of @entity20 ’s only saffron growers , launched his business after finding success growing the crocus sativus flowers in his back garden			1
growing enterprise : mr @entity9 , who is @entity20 ’s only saffron grower , launched his business after finding success growing the crocus sativus flowers in his back garden video courtesy of @entity58 ' i ’ve always wanted to grow something and one day i had a mad idea that i would grow saffron , ' said the 50 - year - old			1
' i live in @entity4 and my family has a connection to @entity66 , two places that were big on saffron production centuries ago			1
' i looked into who was growing saffron and to my surprise i found there was no - one doing it			2
' i was told the practice had died out a few hundred years ago which i thought was ridiculous so i decided to give it a go			0
' the first year i grew the crocuses in my back garden and just built my stock up from there			2
' for the first few years i had some successes and some disasters but there was no - one to turn to for advice - i was learning as i went along			0
production : each crocus flower yields just three stigmas which are picked by hand by an army of volunteers then dried to create the precious saffron strands however , it was n’t until he found a @entity31 manuscript on saffron growing in his local library that things really took off			1
' the turning point came when i found a medieval text for growing saffron in the archives of the library at @entity35 , ' he said			1
' it dated back to the 1600s and confirmed everything i had learned so i knew i was doing it right			0
' at first i had wanted to grow saffron just as a hobby , and so someone in @entity35 was growing it , but it went so well that i decided to turn my hobby into a commercial business			1
' each year we get bigger and bigger and by next season we are hoping to be able to employ people			0
to have that industry back in @entity4 after all these years is amazing			0
' expensive : with a gram , 0.035 of an ounce , of the sought - after spice selling for up to £ 75 , saffron is more expensive than gold because harvesting it is so laborious mr @entity9 runs a geophysics consultancy as well as tending to his crop of crocuses , which get planted in summer then harvested in late autumn			1
tens of thousands of flowers have to be hand picked just at the right moment then dissected to remove the three red stigmas from each one			2
the strands are dried on racks for 24 hours then put into storage containers ready for packing			0
a 0.2g packet of @entity9 ’s saffron sells in @entity17 for £ 15 and it regularly comes out top in taste tests			1
' this year has been a fantastic harvest because of the hot dry summer , ' he said			0
' we ’ve had tens of thousands of flowers to pick but you still only get about 90 grams of saffron from that			2
' it sounds ridiculously small but we sell it in 0.2g packets so it goes a long way			0
' everything has to be picked by hand - you ca n’t mechanise it			2
once you pick the flowers you then have to dissect them to get the stigmas			0
' you only get three stigmas in each flower and they have to be air - dried so the work involved is huge			1
' these days saffron is more associated with exotic locations like @entity23 , @entity166 and @entity167 but in the past @entity169 saffron has been by reputation the best in the world			0
' ours certainly comes out top in taste tests			0
it ’s sweeter and more honey - like than other varieties and i think that ’s down to the nutrients in the soil			0
' we ’re lucky that there ’s a food revolution at the moment and people are prepared to pay a little bit more for quality produce made locally			0
such is the success of his company , @entity190 , that @entity9 is looking to upscale his output by 20 times next season			2
he added : ' we moved into a new field this year which will become our centre for processing and we ’re looking to take on another field next season			0
' we ’re talking about increasing our size dramatically by about 20 times			0
' @entity35 was one of the world ’s major producers of saffron a few centuries ago and we ’re happy to be doing our bit to keep the tradition alive			2

@entity9 started producing the spice after finding a crocus in his garden
his farm is near @entity35 , the heartland of @entity31 saffron production
@entity20 growing as producers could not compete with cheap imported spice
his saffron is now being sold at @entity17 at £ 15 for 0.2 grams
a gram of the sought - after spice is worth up to £ 75
@entity190 is more expensive than gold because harvesting it is so laborious
each crocus flower yields three stigmas which are picked by hand and dried
