lord chief justice @entity0 , who allowed @entity1 to be freed after a panel of judges sitting at the @entity4 said it would be unlawful to keep him locked up a ‘ very dangerous ’ paedophile who attacked children as young as seven has been freed from jail on a technicality , it emerged yesterday			1
a judge had wanted @entity1 – convicted of two separate sex attacks on young girls – to stay locked up indefinitely for the public ’s protection			1
the courts say he is a grave threat to children , and even the sex attacker ’s own lawyers say he has made ‘ no progress whatsoever ’ behind bars			2
yet he was freed after his sentence was ruled ‘ unlawful ’ because it pre-dated the introduction of legal powers to lock up offenders indefinitely			1
incredibly , police have refused to release a photograph of the newly - freed predator in case it makes it harder for @entity1 to ‘ rebuild his life ’			1
last night the case sparked fury among mps and victim groups			0
@entity1 , 48 , was sentenced in 2012 for indecently assaulting a seven - year - old girl			1
the sickening attack took place in 2004 or earlier , with the young victim unable to remember the precise day			0
he had a previous conviction for raping a nine - year - old			1
the judge called @entity1 ‘ a very dangerous offender ’ and gave him an ipp ( imprisonment for public protection ) sentence – which means a person can be held indefinitely			1
ipps were introduced in 2005 and , by the time @entity1 was sentenced , they had been in force for seven years			2
but , because the actual date of his crime pre-dated the introduction of the new powers , the @entity51 ruled its imposition was ‘ unlawful ’			2
as a result , he was released from jail two weeks ago			0
mr @entity59 , sitting with @entity61 ’s most senior judge @entity0 , said yesterday that he had reached his decision ‘ unhappily ’			0
he added : ‘ despite the danger to the public which this applicant clearly represents , we are in no doubt that ... the @entity49 was unlawful			0
’ the appeal court heard that while in prison @entity1 refused to transfer to open conditions			1
the @entity72 described his conduct as unsatisfactory after he threatened staff and was punished for fighting			2
he also refused to discuss his sexual offending			0
an indeterminate prison sentence is where a minimum jail term is set before a defendant can be considered for parole			0
@entity1 had received an @entity49 , an imprisonment for public protection sentence after being convicted of raping a nine - year - old and sexually assaulting a girl aged seven			1
@entity49 sentences had allowed the authorities to keep the most dangerous criminals locked up indefinitely until they have proved they are safe			2
however the @entity51 ruled that @entity49 sentences can only be passed for offences , which happened after april 2005			1
in @entity1 's case , the two offences had occured in october 2001 and may 2004 , meaning it was before the @entity92 came into force			1
therefore judges ruled that there had been no power to impose an @entity49 on @entity1 , which led to his sentence being quashed			1
mr @entity59 said : ‘ this applicant remains a very dangerous man			0
because of his failure to engage with the relevant assistance available to him in prison , he has not begun to address his offending			0
’ the news sparked immediate demands for police to release a picture of the paedophile , which would be normal when a person is convicted of such a serious offence			1
but @entity112 , which covers the area , last night refused			0
a spokesman said @entity1 was now ‘ back in the community trying to rebuild his life ’ and releasing a picture could disrupt that			2
@entity120 , head of service at the charity @entity122 , said : ‘ it is extremely frightening that a child rapist described as “ very dangerous ” and unrepentant has been released back into the community due to what seems like a legal technicality surrounding the timing of the offence			2
‘ sexual offending can be compulsive			0
any offender with a history of child sex abuse should be considered a risk to children ’s safety for the rest of their lives			1
’ mr @entity120 called for the disclosure of details about the paedophile			0
he added : ‘ every measure needs to be taken to ensure our children are kept safe			0
’ @entity145 , @entity145 mp for @entity146 , said last night : ‘ this is really worrying			0
‘ given that both the original sentencing judge and the judge today described @entity1 as “ very dangerous ” , i am really concerned that he has been released			2
‘ i ’m sure parents in @entity146 will be worried given the nature of the crimes he has committed			0
i appreciate this a legally complex case but ... i hope safeguards have been put in place to keep children safe			0
’ the three judges sitting at the @entity51 , pictured , allowed @entity1 to be freed after his sentence was ruled unlawful			1

@entity164 had been jailed indefinitely for child sex offences
48 - year - old had been described as violent and a serious risk to children
paedophile had raped a nine - year - old and sexually assaulted a girl aged 7
@entity4 also told @entity1 's conduct in prison had been ' unsatisfactory '
but he has now been released after his sentences was ruled ' unlawful '
*gwent* police have also refused to release a photo of @entity1
