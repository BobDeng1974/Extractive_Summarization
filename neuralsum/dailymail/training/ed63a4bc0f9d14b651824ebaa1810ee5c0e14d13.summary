shock : @entity1 has told how she was refused service by a ' racist ' shop assistant in @entity4 she is one of the richest and most famous women on the planet			1
so when @entity1 popped in to an upmarket boutique for a new designer handbag she was taken aback when the shop assistant refused to show her a bag			1
she said the £ 24,460 crocodile skin item was ‘ too expensive ’			0
instead of making a scene , the billionaire tv magnate calmly left the @entity4 store			1
but she has now hit back at her treatment in a furious interview on @entity18 television , claiming she was a victim of ‘ racism ’			0
miss @entity1 , 59 , said : ‘ i was in @entity20 the other day , in a store whose name i will not mention			1
i did n’t have my eyelashes on , but i was in full @entity1 gear			1
' i had my little @entity28 skirt and my little sandals			0
but obviously the @entity30 is not shown in @entity20			1
‘ i go into a store and i say to the woman ‘ ‘ excuse me , could i see the bag right above your head ? ” and she says to me “ no. it ’s too expensive			1
” ’ miss @entity1 asked a second time to see the bag , which was locked in a cabinet to deter shoplifters			1
but oblivious to her fame and fortune , the shop assistant allegedly replied : ‘ no , no , you do n’t want to see that one , you want to see this one because that one will cost too much			1
you will not be able to afford that			2
’ it may have been beyond the salaries of ordinary mortals , but £ 24,460 is small change to a celebrity worth about £ 1.8billion			2
miss @entity1 added : ‘ i could have had the big blow - up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff			1
@entity68 designed the handbag for the actress , pictured with it left , and now makes it in a number of different finishes , right turned away : the assistant serving @entity1 in the boutique owned by @entity77 ( pictured ) told @entity1 : ' you will not be able to afford that ' when she asked to see a hanbag ‘ but why do that ? but it [ racism ] still exists , of course it does			1
’ ‘ i left the store but it proves that racism is still an issue , ’ she added			2
referring to a famous movie scene in which @entity86 tells a snobbish boutique salesman that he wants to spend an obscene amount of money she added : ‘ i wanted to create a @entity91 moment and come back and buy everything and say ‘ ‘ big mistake ! ’ ’			0
but then i thought she ’d get a commission , so let ’s not do that , ’ she added miss @entity1 was in @entity20 for the wedding of her friend @entity99 to @entity100 last month			1
she was staying in the five - star @entity101 at the time			0
the incident happened in a branch of the chic @entity106 chain of boutiques			1
ironically , its owner @entity77 was also a guest at miss @entity99 ’s nuptials			1
miss @entity77 apologised for the incident , blaming it on a ‘ misunderstanding ’			1
‘ everyone wants to sell a crocodile bag , ’ ms @entity77 said			0
‘ it ’s a misunderstanding			0
she insisted her saleswomen put customers first and try to be ‘ kind ’			0
however , @entity20 trade president @entity120 condemned the snub saying : ‘ it ’s totally unacceptable			2
i ’ve never heard of anything like it			0
’ @entity4 tourism spokesman @entity125 added : ‘ we are totally ashamed about what happened			0
this sales assistant was completely in the wrong			0
' we apologise on behalf of @entity4 tourism for what happened			0
‘ this was a one - off and will not have a long lasting effect on the popularity of @entity4 , but the saleswoman should apologise to @entity1			2
’ it ’s not the first time that miss @entity1 has had a run in with a high - end boutique			2
in 2005 @entity140 apologised to her after she was turned away from their @entity142 store because it was hosting a private function			2
miss @entity1 ’s allegations come as @entity4 authorities were criticised for introducing ‘ apartheid ’ style plans to ban asylum seekers from public places such as swimming pools , playing fields and libraries			2
@entity4 has 48,000 asylum seekers or one for every 332 inhabitants , which is double the @entity157 average			0
race row : the owner of @entity160 , in @entity20 , @entity4 , apologised after @entity1 said she had been the ' victim of racism ' while visiting the store offense : a ' racist ' shop assistant at @entity160 refused to show @entity1 a bag because it was ' too expensive ' and she should look at the cheaper merchandise , the star claimed during a tv interview girls ' weekend : @entity1 and best friend @entity171 ahead of @entity99 and @entity100 's wedding celebrations in @entity20 , @entity4 race row : @entity1 was a guest at the wedding of @entity99 and @entity100 , pictured , in @entity20 , @entity4 even if @entity1 had been allowed to look at the handbag , she may have thought twice before buying it			1
the £ 24,460 bag was reportedly a crocodile - skin version of one of @entity181 ’s favourite designs			0
the @entity68 @entity182 , named after the 44 - year - old former friends star , is often seen on the arm of fashion - conscious celebrities			0
but as miss @entity1 is a strident opponent of animal fur clothing and was named 2008 @entity187 by animal rights group @entity188 , she may have felt crocodile skin was a step too far			2
the tv host has occasionally worn leather belts and scarves , but crocodile skin is seen by some campaigners as being particularly cruel , given the poor treatment exotic species are often subjected to by farmers			0
a spokesman for @entity68 could not be contacted to confirm if the handbag was made of real or imitation crocodile skin .			0
