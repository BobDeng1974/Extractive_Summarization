by @entity0 published : 03:28 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 3 october 2012 following a fashion designer 's worst nightmare , there was a one - hour hole in the normally tight @entity6 calendar			1
representatives of @entity9 - based label @entity8 said its entire collection had been lost			2
@entity12 designer @entity11 was set to present his spring / summer 2013 collection to the media yesterday afternoon , on the penultimate day of the @entity16 schedule			1
but it has come to light that the courier company that was transporting the collection has lost all the clothes			2
a-list fan @entity22 wore @entity23 to attend a @entity25 cocktail party held by @entity26 yesterday , and @entity27 , @entity28 in @entity29 ; @entity28 wears @entity23 at the @entity30 in 2011 pr company @entity31 sent out emails yesterday to all those with invitations saying the preview was cancelled - after it became clear that the collection had disappeared			1
' the whole collection is lost , ' said @entity39 of @entity31			0
' it was when they were being transported			0
we do n't know how			0
' this is not the first time a courier company has been to blame for the loss or theft of a fashion collection			0
high profile fans : last season @entity50 sat front row at the @entity29 show - and this year 's turnout was set to be just as stellar last november , @entity55 was forced to cancel his much - anticipated @entity57 press day after his entire spring / summer 2012 collection was stolen from a train bound for @entity9 from @entity16			1
the 46 - look range was due to go on show in the capital to give @entity64 fashion editors the chance to sample next year 's trendsetters			1
but in an e-mail circulated to the media the company said it could no longer go ahead because of the theft			0
as the pieces were effectively worthless because they were not yet in production , this led to fears that counterfeiters may be involved			0
thankfully in this instance @entity23 is re-making the show pieces for an exclusive screening later in the week to be attended by selected members of the press and fashion elite .			2
