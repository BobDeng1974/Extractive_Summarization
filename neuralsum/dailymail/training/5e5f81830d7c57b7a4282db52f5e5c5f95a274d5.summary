round from hell : @entity0 lost the lead after a second round 78 at the @entity28 , @entity3 in form : @entity0 had arrived in @entity3 after winning the @entity30 in @entity14 spellbound : @entity20 updated her picture on @entity22 to that of her stirring a cauldron @entity35 's @entity34 stormed into a three - shot lead after a second successive six - under - par round of 66 , which included an eagle , six birdies and just the two dropped shots , left him on 12 under for the tournament and with clear daylight to the chasing pack heading into the weekend			1
' i was ecstatic with the way i played , ' @entity34 said on www.pgatour.com			0
' there was a couple of mistakes in there but that 's @entity53			2
it 's a tricky golf course and you do n't need to do a lot wrong to make a mistake			2
' in second spot , three shots back after a 69 is @entity60 , while @entity61 is a further shot adrift in third after a second - round 70			0
@entity34 , @entity60 and @entity61 were all joint second following the first day , which was dominated by @entity0			1

however , the 25 - year - old had a day to forget on friday as he carded a six - over - par 78 to tumble down the leaderboard			2
great @entity70 : @entity71 has taken the lead in @entity3 at six under par after the second round most of the damage was done on a disastrous opening nine where three consecutive double bogeys saw him go out in 43 at @entity53			1
starting on the back nine , @entity0 bogeyed his opening hole , the par - four 10th , before parring 11 and picking the shot back up on 12			1
it went rapidly downhill after that , though , as double bogeys followed on 13 , 14 and 15 before two pars and a further bogey saw him reach the turn four shots off the lead			0
that represented a 12 - shot collapse on the back nine from thursday where he had picked up two eagles , three birdies and a double bogey to record a 31			0
@entity0 did manage to turn things round a bit on the back nine though , picking up birdies on the second and seventh while only dropping the one shot in between as he ended the day on three under par overall			1
frontrunner : @entity35 's @entity34 stormed into a three - shot lead after a second successive 66 despite that partial recovery though , @entity0 found himself nine shots behind @entity34 at the end of the day as the 36 - year - old @entity35 enjoyed another good round in @entity3			1
@entity0 hurt his knee during thursday 's round , but he insisted it did not affect him too badly on friday			1
he said : ' the knee 's ok			0
it was a little bit sore this morning on the range but out on the course it was fine , the painkillers kicked in			0
i felt it a little bit but it did n't really bother me too much			0
' i missed fairways , that was a big thing , i did n't realise how thick the rough was until i got into it today			0
obviously that three - hole stretch , 13 , 14 , 15 , did n't help			0
take those three holes out of it and it would n't actually have been that bad a day			0
' it 's not disastrous even though i had such a bad day			2
' after @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity131 ( 67 ) and @entity132 ( 68 ) were joint fourth on seven under , followed by a group of four on six under - @entity71 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			2
