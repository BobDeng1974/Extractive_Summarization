by @entity0 published : 03:11 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 08:20 est , 10 september 2012 free man : judge @entity2 said that @entity3 should not be jailed because it would just cost the taxpayer even more money a @entity8 benefits cheat has been spared jail because the judge sentencing him said the cost of locking him up for a year would be the same as the amount he swindled			1

but despite this discrepancy judge @entity27 told @entity29 that he would not go to prison			2
' £ 39,000 is what it costs to keep one man in prison for a year			2
do i wish to burden the state further with another £ 38,000 to £ 40,000 , much as i think it is deserved ? ' she said			0

the court heard the benefits were claimed on the basis @entity3 was unfit to work , but he had actually had a job			1
he managed to evade detection because of inadequate employers ’ records and by giving different addresses , bank account and national insurance numbers , mr @entity46 said			0

' mr @entity73 said his client had only been able to do that because he was living off his fraudulent benefits , and sending his earnings out of the @entity78			1
mr @entity73 described @entity3 ’s early life in @entity8 as ' hell ' , and said he had seen his mother and father killed when he was aged 15 , and seen his brothers and sisters killed a year later			2
