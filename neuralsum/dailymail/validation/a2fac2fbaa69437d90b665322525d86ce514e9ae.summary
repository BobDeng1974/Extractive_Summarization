mrs @entity0 has yet to comment on the row over her private email server @entity0 arranged for a ‘ homebrew ’ email server to be set up whilst secretary of state amid an atmosphere of ‘ what @entity0 wants , @entity0 gets ’			1
a former senior it official in the @entity9 told @entity10 that mrs @entity0 was ‘ demanding ’ and that staff had to get things done without asking too many questions			1
the existence of the server at her private home in @entity17 , @entity18 , would have been known to just a close circle of friends as ‘ these are things that are not discussed ’ , he said			1
the former official also spoke of his frustration that mrs @entity0 ’s actions had deprived the public of vital historical records			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t agree with it			2
this is history that you are throwing away here ’			2
mrs @entity0 , who is expected to run for president in 2016 , has yet to comment on the row over her private email server , which she set up in 2009 when she came to office			2
federal law requires all letters and emails written by government officials to be retained for congressional committees , historians and so the media can access them			0
however mrs @entity0 did not even have a government email address whilst serving as @entity44 ’s top diplomat for four years until 2013			0
mrs @entity0 ’s actions mean it will be harder to obtain copies of the emails through freedom of information laws - and could have been a breach of federal law			0
the former official said he did not know at the time what mrs @entity0 was doing but said that he was ‘ not surprised ’ when it became public knowledge			1
he said that under her watch the mantra was : ‘ this is what the secretary wants , this is what the secretary gets			1
’ he said : ‘ if you ’ve ever met a secretary of state they are demanding ... that ’s the reason they head the @entity9			1
@entity0 was no different ’			2
the former official said that the rules from the @entity69 are ‘ antiquated ’ and say that it falls on the individual to save their emails for archiving purposes			1
there is little oversight meaning that mrs @entity0 would have effectively been able to decide herself how she would be presented in the history books , which the official said was wrong			2
he said : ‘ once you get into the senior levels of government , anything we talk about is going to be of historical merit , even if it might be minor now			1
‘ twenty years from now it could be a major thing ’			1
mrs @entity0 ’s actions mean it will be harder to obtain copies of the emails through freedom of information laws - and could have been a breach of federal law the row over the server is acutely embarrassing for mrs @entity0 and has stoked fears among @entity97 that she might make the kind of missteps in 2016 that she did when she lost to @entity100 in 2008			2
@entity101 have said that , aside from the potential breach of security , what she did was ethically wrong			0
mrs @entity0 has so far not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym , @entity110			2
according to the @entity112 , that name does not appear in public records databases , campaign contribution records or internet background searches			0
@entity110 was listed as the customer at @entity118 's $ 1.7 million home on @entity119 in @entity17 in records registering the internet address for her email server since august 2010			0
the @entity124 personality also is associated with a separate email server , presidentclinton.com , and a non-functioning website , @entity127 , all linked to the same residential internet account as mrs. @entity0 's email server			0
the former president 's full name is @entity118			0
@entity133 , a phd candidate in computer science & law lecturer at @entity136 , said that mrs @entity0 may have told her internet service provider that she was starting a small business to allow her to set up the server			0
he said that @entity141 companies like @entity142 are wary about allowing individuals to do so as they might be hackers looking to send spam			0
mr @entity133 added that after carrying out his own tests it appears that mrs @entity0 ’s server is still up and running , despite the ongoing row			0
he told @entity10 that it ‘ does appear that it ’s the same server , though i can not be sure ’			1
a @entity9 spokeswoman has insisted that mrs @entity0 did not send any classified emails from her personal email account			1
she has also said that mrs @entity0 has handed over 55,000 emails to the @entity69 , though not only after they were vetted by her team			0
