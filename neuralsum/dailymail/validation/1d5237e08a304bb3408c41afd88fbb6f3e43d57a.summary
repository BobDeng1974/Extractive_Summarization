when the first astronauts land on @entity2 , they will not use a conventional parachute or heat shield that has been used before			1
instead , upon impacting the upper @entity2 atmosphere , a large inflatable saucer - shaped structure will slow their progress			2
this is the low density supersonic decelerator ( @entity9 ) and , in june , @entity10 will perform the latest test of this groundbreaking technology - a vital next step in the journey to @entity2			1
scroll down for a video from last year 's test in june , the vehicle will be sent into near - space from the @entity20 's @entity19 on @entity21 , @entity22 , to test its re-entry capabilities into @entity25 's atmosphere tomorrow at 9am to 10am pdt ( 5pm to 6pm gmt ) , @entity10 will perform a spin test of the vehicle at the @entity28 in @entity29 before transporting it to @entity22			1
the event will be streamed live on @entity31 , and viewers will be able to ask questions on @entity34 using the # @entity36 hashtag			0
ultimately , the vehicle will be sent into near - space from the @entity20 's @entity19 on @entity21 , @entity22 , in june			2
the @entity9 is unique in its design , using a donut - shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag			1
when attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at @entity44 it will be capable of slowing it down to @entity46 , where a regular parachute can then deploy			0
last june , to simulate the @entity2 atmosphere on @entity25 , the @entity9 was lifted to a height of 23 miles ( 37km ) by a high - altitude balloon			1
a small rocket then launched it 11 miles ( 18km ) higher			0
as this point the @entity9 inflated around a larger saucer - shaped object , bringing it safely back to land in open water			2
‘ the @entity9 crosscutting demonstration mission will test breakthrough technologies that will enable large payloads to be safely landed on the surface of @entity2 , or other planetary bodies with atmospheres , including @entity25 , ’ @entity10 said in a statement			1
‘ the technologies will not only enable landing of larger payloads on @entity2 , but also allow access to much more of the planet 's surface by enabling landings at higher - altitude sites			2
’ @entity74 parachute , the @entity9 is large - 15ft ( 4.6 metres ) wide and weighing 7,000lbs ( 3.200kg ) - in order to cope with the atmosphere of @entity2			1
@entity25 has a reasonably thick atmosphere , so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface			0
but the @entity2 atmosphere is much thinner , so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely			0
the system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of @entity2			0
the main structural body of the second flight test vehicle in @entity10 's @entity9 project is seen during its assembly in a cleanroom at @entity10 's @entity93 flight test for this vehicle is planned in june of this year			1
it will eventually be used to take humans to the surface of @entity2 a successful test took place in june 2014 , shown , when the @entity9 successfully re-entered part of @entity25 's atmosphere			1
it showed that while some aspects of the vehicle worked , others - like its parachutes - needed further development following the test the @entity107 , for example , needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology was n’t ready yet			2
instead , to land the rover on the surface @entity10 developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ‘ sky crane ’			0
the @entity9 , however , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than @entity107 , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves			2
there will be four tests of the @entity9 in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future @entity2 missions			1
the tests are taking place over the @entity130 island of @entity21 in june			0
in a test last year , in june 2014 , the vehicle was partially successful - although a parachute was torn apart when it deployed , owing to the high forces			0
moment of truth : the parachute is shown here unfurling on the right			0
the balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb ( 90kg ) parachute from its sturdy canister the @entity9 , shown , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than @entity107 , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle			1
the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) is a large , doughnut - shaped air brake that deployed during the flight , helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound			0
the second , the @entity159 , is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown			0
it has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the @entity146 that carried the @entity107 to the surface of @entity2			0
' a good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things , and that is certainly what we have in this case , ' said @entity175 , principal investigator for @entity9 at @entity10 's @entity28 , after the test			1
and @entity10 will be hoping to learn just as much on their latest attempt at using the @entity9 .			2

@entity10 will fly its new heat shield from @entity22 in a couple of months
tomorrow it will perform a spin - test of the new technology
it is known as the low density supersonic decelerator ( @entity9 )
@entity10 says it could one *day* be used to take humans onto @entity2
