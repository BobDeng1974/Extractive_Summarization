an @entity1 training plane came dangerously close to colliding with a remote controlled aircraft while flying above @entity4 , it has emerged			1
the plane came to within just 40ft of the remote - controlled model aircraft , which the report stated may have been flying at 600ft			1
a @entity10 @entity9 report labelled the incident on february 4 2014 as ' high severity ' and said the ' safety of the aircraft may have been compromised '			1
the pilot of the @entity27 aircraft was forced to bank hard to the left in order to avoid a collision after it appeared both aircraft were flying at the same height			1
the report stated : ' the differing perceptions of aircraft height from the @entity27 pilot and model aircraft operator are fundamental to this incident			1
' the model aircraft operator believed that his aircraft was flying considerably lower than seemed to be the case , backed up by the evidence of the @entity27 â€™s height from radar replays			2
' while the report said the local model aircraft flying club had been permitted to use the airspace , the safety board report concluded ' safety margins had been much reduced '			1
the board suggested because nearby @entity54 had changed to a non-flying base , users of the airspace had become less aware of dangers			2
it said all operators in the area needed to be alert to each other 's activities			0
the @entity64 said @entity54 had since returned to flying status			0
@entity67 member @entity66 said he was familiar with the incident			0
' we can only gauge that height that we 're flying and we tend not to fly too high anyway			0
you 're not likely to go up too high anyway - but we 're bound to keep within 400ft with models that are ( under ) 7kgs			0
' i was n't the person involved			0
he reported the incident because he felt it necessary that the full sized aircraft are aware that we are there because we 've been there for forty years			2
' the club 's secretary @entity82 declined to comment , saying that he disputed some of the facts in the report .			0
