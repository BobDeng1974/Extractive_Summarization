@entity0 accused referee @entity1 of denying @entity2 ‘ two clear - cut penalties ’ as they drew with @entity4 at the @entity5			1
@entity0 was furious that @entity1 did not penalise @entity6 for handling @entity8 ’s header in the second - half , and also claimed that @entity10 was fouled as he attempted to score from close - range when another @entity8 effort hit the post			1
‘ we had two clear penalty claims that should have been given , certainly the first one , ’ said the @entity2 manager			1
it ’s a goalbound header and he ’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down			1
‘ the referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he has n’t given it i do n’t know			2
‘ it ’s a waste of time ( speaking to @entity1 about it )			2
i ’m sure he will say something like the lad could n’t get out of the way because he was so close but i do n’t think that ’s the case			0
@entity8 's header clearly hits @entity6 's arm during the second - half at the @entity5 the ball clearly hits the arm of @entity4 defender @entity6 on the way through ‘ then we hit the post from @entity8 ’s header and it ’s come back out and @entity10 has been taken out			1
he was just waiting to put the ball over the line			0
from our point of view it ’s two clear - cut penalties			0
‘ if you look at those two situations and then the opportunities in the first half , overall i think we were the better team			0
‘ @entity57 goes through and should have done better			0
it ’s disappointing because at 2 - 0 we would been in a situation where i do n’t think @entity4 would have been able to come back given the way they performed			1
’ @entity2 players surround referee @entity1 after he failed to award a penalty at the @entity5 @entity0 ca n't hide his frustration as referee @entity1 refused his @entity2 side a penalty @entity8 backed his manager ’s point of view , saying : ‘ i thought it was a definite penalty			1
it was a yard away from me and i knew i won the header cleanly			0
i think @entity6 had his hands up			2
’ united manager @entity19 claimed that he did not see the incident but questioned whether @entity6 ’s actions were deliberate			2
‘ why did he raise his hand ? ’ said @entity75			0
‘ i do n’t think that it ’s always a penalty when the ball is hitting the hand or the arm or something like that			0
i have to see it , and i have n’t seen i yet			0
’ @entity84 reacted first as the ball fell kindly to him to put @entity2 ahead after just two minutes @entity86 ( second right ) showed his poacher 's instinct to scored @entity4 's equaliser			1

@entity8 's second - half header appeared to hit @entity6 's arm
referee @entity1 was well - placed , but did not give a spot kick
@entity2 held on for a 1 - 1 draw against @entity4 at the @entity5
an *unmarked* @entity84 put @entity2 ahead after just two minutes
@entity86 equalised from close range for @entity4
