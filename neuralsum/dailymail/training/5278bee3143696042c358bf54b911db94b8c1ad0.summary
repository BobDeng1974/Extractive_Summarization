by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 10 june 2013 with his penchant for ' hunny ' and a philosophical outlook , @entity1 was the charming bear whose tales captivated children from the day they were first published nearly 90 years ago			2
but while the the bear of little brain is still popular with his young audience , a publisher has decided that perhaps his gentle stories are not fast - moving enough for today 's youngsters			1
today , @entity15 releases a new app for @entity17 and @entity18 - featuring a shorter , and speeded - up version of @entity1 's adventures in the @entity21			1
the story of @entity1 has been abridged for a new app because today 's children have shorter attention spans the @entity27 app , which is read by actor @entity28 and is free to download , abridges @entity30 's story because the publisher says children will lose interest if the story does not zip along			1
@entity35 , who developed the story for @entity15 , said today 's young readers would move on if they were not grabbed in the first 60 seconds			1
' today 's children 's attention spans are slightly different to how they were in 1926 , ' he said			2
‘ we have a minute to get them on board			2
if not , they will move on to the next app , ' he told @entity45			2
@entity15 's @entity46 said the stories had to be made more appealing to a modern audience to keep them relevant to today 's children			1
‘ as a children ’s publisher , we want to be where children are experiencing entertainment and that is in the digital format , ’ he @entity50			1
the @entity27 app will feature animated versions of the original drawings by the late @entity60 ‘ we ’ve been working with illustrations that are 85 years old which have a place in @entity64 culture , illustrations that are greatly loved			0
we had to look at it very sensitively and that ’s what we ’ve tried to do			0
’ a second story app is available to buy for £ 1.99 , and further stories will be available later this year			1
this morning , popular children 's author @entity70 , 35 , said it was ' tragic ' that such a gentle story had to be speeded up for modern children			0
the award - winning author of @entity77 said : ' i 've got two boys of my own , aged six and four , and we enjoy the bedtime ritual where we sit down and have time to read picture books and look at the illustrations			0
' it is especially sad given that the @entity27 stories are so soft and gentle , and have such lovely pictures			0
' i am very against e-books , because i think everything in the modern world moves at such a frantic pace			0
reading a book at their own pace offers children a chance to slow down and use their imagination , and really enjoy the story			1
' the new @entity27 app , available from today , features animations of the original @entity1 drawings new drawings show the bear and his friend @entity103 enjoying the sights of @entity106 , including the @entity107 , pictured the new drawings , by illustrator @entity109 , depict @entity1 visiting @entity106 and playing pooh sticks on the @entity111 the @entity27 stories for the app are not new , but the publisher has released publicity images drawn by @entity109 in the style of original illustrator @entity60 of @entity27 bear and his friend @entity103 in modern settings			1
there is one of @entity1 taking a photograph of @entity106 skyscraper the shard with his mobile phone , another showing the pair on the @entity127 , and another showing them getting off a @entity129 train			0
@entity1 , who was named after @entity30 's son @entity130 's stuffed teddy bear , lost his hyphens when @entity133 adapted his stories for the screen in the 1960s			0
the anthropomorphic bear and his friends have enchanted youngsters for decades , generating millions in the process			0
in 1930 , @entity142 @entity141 bought the @entity142 and @entity144 rights for @entity1 from @entity30 for $ 1,000 and 66 per cent of @entity141 's income , and by the following year it was a $ 50m - a - year business			0
the stories about @entity27 bear have been translated into many languages including @entity150 and even @entity151 , and have inspired films , television series , and a lucrative range of @entity27 - related merchandise .			2
