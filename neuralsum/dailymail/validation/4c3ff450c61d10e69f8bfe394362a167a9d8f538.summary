@entity3 ' @entity2 international @entity1 will be sidelined for around three months with a shoulder injury , coach @entity0 has confirmed			1
the 25 - year - old former @entity6 winger , who missed just two matches in his first season with the @entity9 in 2014 , will undergo surgery on saturday after scans revealed the full extent of an injury he has been carrying for a few weeks			1
' there 's a fair bit of damage in there , ' @entity0 said			1
' he 's been good for us so we 'll miss him but it gives an opportunity for @entity21 to get some more game time			2
@entity3 ' @entity2 international @entity1 will be sidelined for around three months with a shoulder injury ' he did okay against @entity24			1
the acid test for @entity26 will come in the coming weeks to maintain that level			0
' @entity21 , 19 , made only his second @entity29 appearance and scored his first try in @entity3 ' 26 - 14 win over @entity24 last friday and keeps his spot for the trip to @entity34 to face @entity35 on saturday , while @entity36 will continue to deputise for skipper @entity37 , who is still recovering from a hamstring injury			1
another @entity2 international , @entity39 , keeps his place pending the outcome of an investigation into an assault he committed on a student in @entity3 in february			2
' at some stage the club will make an announcement , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think it 's coming to its conclusion but we 're still on with it			0
' @entity3 @entity9 coach @entity0 admits @entity1 's injury lay - off is a blow for the team @entity39 was dropped when the incident came to light earlier this month but recalled for the @entity24 game and @entity0 insists he is right to select the player , who was released by police without charge after paying compensation and issuing an apology to his victim			1
' @entity39 gets paid to do a job , ' @entity0 added			2
' i know there is a sentiment from people out there who say ' why is he still playing ? ' but to stand @entity39 down does n't do him any good			0
' if a bricklayer makes an error at work , you do n't give him time off			0
why would we give @entity39 the time off to live a decent lifestyle where he can do what he wants ? ' he has to do a job for us			0
he is paid to do that job and he will go out and do it			0
i do n't feel that 's covering anything up			0
