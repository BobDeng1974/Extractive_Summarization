unification fights are nothing new in boxing but the divisions @entity3 will be fighting to close this saturday night are more important than titles and belts			1
@entity6 is not only bidding to become a world champion but to help heal the sectarian rifts which still haunt he city of @entity10			2
@entity3 takes on @entity11 for the @entity14 super-bantamweight title , while challenging the old prejudices which brought decades of strife to @entity17			1
it is a @entity24 task so it is fitting that it will be undertaken on the site from which that great , if doomed , vessel was launched			0
a temporary arena has been erected in the @entity30 of @entity10 and it is a tribute to the power for good of which the hardest old game is capable that it will be packed with 16,000 @entity34 and women of both religious persuasions			2
thus @entity3 follows in the courageous footsteps of his mentor			2
the great @entity41 , now @entity3 ’s manager and promoter , defied the worst of @entity43 in reverse wedlock to his protegee , as a @entity22 married to a @entity20			1
the @entity46 also campaigned for peace while bringing a world championship to @entity17 , in his case by defeating the renowned featherweight maestro @entity50 in @entity51 in 1985			0
weigh - in : the fight will take place in the @entity30 of @entity3 's hometown , @entity10 @entity55 - to - head : @entity3 squares up to @entity11 during the weigh - in in @entity10 @entity58 : @entity11 , from @entity59 , was unfazed by @entity3 's theatrics promoter : @entity41 recognises something of himself in @entity63 @entity41 , who has been married to @entity64 for 33 years now , says of young @entity65 : ‘ he ’s a great boxer and a bright kid from a hard loyalist district , she ’s a lovely girl with a degree in criminology from a tough @entity72 area			1
‘ they offer hope for a new kind of @entity10			0
’ as did @entity41 himself two decades ago			0
@entity3 talks just as eloquently about being brought up at a virtual battle - front , in streets where the walls were pock - marked with bullet holes			0
as both his ring-wise inspiration and his living example , @entity41 has steered @entity3 to the brink of glory in only his 18th fight while offering living proof that the bitterest of enmities can be overcome			1
manager : @entity3 's manager ad promoter is @entity41 , who can empathise with @entity3 's past the combine into a formidable force , one which @entity11 for all his qualities is unlikely to be able to resist			1
@entity3 has already stopped the @entity58 once , in the ninth round early last year , and should be able to repeat that achievement , especially given home advantage again			0
@entity11 regrouped , admirably , to claim this @entity14 title but @entity3 has been getting stronger and better with every fight			1
the @entity102 ’s family – both parents , his pregnant wife and their three - year - old daughter @entity104 – will be in close attendance			0
opponent : @entity11 's record is fought 35 , won 31 ( 23 by knockout ) and lost four they are likely to see him triumph more quickly if he goes to work on the @entity11 body from the start			2
it was when he stepped up that mode of attack that this opponent began to unravel first time out			0
if so , a golden future will open for @entity3 in the shape of more traditional title unification fights against @entity121 , @entity122 and current champion emeritus @entity123			2
of itself , this will be the biggest fight in @entity10 since @entity41 used to fill the old @entity126 by uniting rival communities in the name of sport			1
the open night air will be electric with anticipation			0
expect exciting victory , inside and outside the ring			0
@entity3 v @entity11 will be televised live on @entity134 this saturday from 7 pm			1

@entity41 is @entity3 's manager and promoter
