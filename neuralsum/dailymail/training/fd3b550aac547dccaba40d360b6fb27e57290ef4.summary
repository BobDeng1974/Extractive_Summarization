by the look of this @entity2 , both sides are going to have to unearth a formula from somewhere that allows them to take 20 wickets			1
@entity7 came close , and i think they ’ll take more out of the match than @entity10			1
but on this kind of surface , and with the balance both teams have gone for , stalemate was always the likeliest outcome			0
cricket deserves a better surface than this			0
more than grass , @entity7 would have craved pace and carry , both because it allows batsmen to play their shots and because the nicks carry to the slips			1
and when both sides are packing their teams with batsmen , you ’re struggling to look beyond a draw			0
those were the tactics i expected from @entity10			0
they lost here 4 - 0 three years ago and they have n’t won an away test since 2011			0
@entity48 always liked to fill his @entity7 side with batsmen and he wanted to make sure @entity10 were n’t going to @entity52 ’s 1 - 0 down			1
saving grace : @entity55 's runs got @entity10 out of trouble at @entity29 but @entity10 may have got their selection wrong			1
even though @entity55 scored some runs to get them out of trouble on sunday , they may have looked at the history of @entity29 and picked a side in expectation of some swing			2
yet the pitch was more suited to a second spinner and @entity68 might have been a more logical option			0
i do n’t think @entity71 will spin big , so @entity10 will need something better from @entity73 if they ’re going to take 20 wickets — especially if @entity76 is batting as low as no 8			1
equally , @entity7 will have to find a way to knock over @entity10 more quickly			1
papering over the cracks : @entity79 and @entity81 's late stand masked @entity7 's deficiencies when @entity83 bowled @entity84 , they had a sniff , but after that it was pretty slow going			2
overall , i thought they bowled pretty well , apart from operating with too many 7 - 2 off - side fields in @entity10 ’s first innings — i felt they should have bowled straighter			2
@entity30 ’s captaincy was fine , if a little reactive in the second innings			0
but they must find a way to stop these batting collapses			0
the last - wicket stand between @entity79 and @entity81 was very enjoyable , but it masked the fact that , on the plumbest of pitches , @entity7 had lost six wickets from a position of strength .			2

@entity7 drew the first test in the series against @entity10 at @entity29
@entity7 need a pitch with pace to allow them to take 20 wickets
@entity30 's side will have to find a way of knocking @entity10 out more quickly at @entity71
