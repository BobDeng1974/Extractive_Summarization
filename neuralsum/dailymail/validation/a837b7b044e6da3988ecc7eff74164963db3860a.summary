a daredevil @entity1 wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares			1
and the amazing night - time flight by @entity11 , 33 , was not only captured on video , but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer @entity14			1
in the picture @entity11 's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000 - foot @entity20 mountain in the resort town of @entity22 in central @entity1 to the bottom			1
he said : ' i wanted to do a wingsuit base flight at night during winter for a very long time			1
but somehow i never really managed to do it			2
' the idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded			1
the first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away , where the camera needed to be placed			2
they solved it , though , by using two superheated emergency flares			1
these also provided some light to help illuminate the way , although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire			0
@entity11 said : ' we used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies			1
but flares burn very , very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit			2
that would have been super dangerous			0
to show how dangerous the jump was , @entity11 did a trial run in daylight a slight mistake would have sent @entity11 crashing into craggy rocks the wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video , with @entity11 zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed ' there definitely was a lot of pressure			1
even though we did intense testing before , i did not know for sure how it would turn out			0
having fire really close to you on a wingsuit base flight leaves no margin for error			2
everything has to be worked out			0
' the two photographers , @entity101 and @entity14 , stood on the other side of the valley on the @entity104 to take the snap			0
@entity11 also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute			1
he said : ' i definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me , as this could be very dangerous			0
i only have one single parachute attached to me			0
if this one burns or melts , it 's over ! ' @entity11 decided to use two torches			1
the first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer			0
when the torch burned out , he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air , ignited a second torch attached to his foot			2
he said : ' i only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and i only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area			0
' @entity11 has jumped at night before , but not in winter and only at full moon			1
he said : ' the feeling was very intense and amazing			0
it is much harder to orientate yourself , as you ca n't see as well			0
it feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements			0

@entity141 daredevil @entity11 jumped off a 10,000 - foot @entity1 peak
first he filmed himself performing a daylight flight down @entity20 mountain
then he did the same jump at night , guided by emergency flares
a slow shutter picture of the descent shows his route as a red line
