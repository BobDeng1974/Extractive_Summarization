by @entity0 @entity1 has expressed his ' sadness ' after his firm 's controversial $ 350 million revamp of the @entity5 was scrapped			1
the celebrated architect 's company @entity6 had been enlisted to redesign the @entity5 's century - old @entity9 on @entity11 's @entity10			1
the plan had drawn widespread opposition from scholars and was the target of four lawsuits			0
one critic labelled the @entity1 design as having ' all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall '			1
the @entity5 has abandoned its $ 300 million plan to revamp its flagship midtown @entity11 building and move 1.5 million books to @entity25 @entity27 's new mayor @entity26 also campaigned against the renovations during last year 's municipal elections			1
and only last week hundreds of protesters gathered outside the building during a meeting of trustees			0
but the most obvious reason for the u-turn is the project 's increasing price tag			0
@entity6 declined to comment , but @entity1 told the @entity38 : ' obviously , i respect the decision of the trustees and whoever 's been involved in the decision			1
' if i have any kind of sadness on the thing – besides obviously not having the project going ahead and having spent a huge amount of passion on the project with colleagues – it is that the proposals have never been revealed , and there has n't really been a debate by those involved , including those who would have benefited from an inclusive approach to the library			1
' @entity59 architect @entity1 has expressed his ' sadness ' that his firm 's plan to revamp the @entity5 has been scrapped the renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the @entity10 building to storage in @entity25 @entity27 's new mayor @entity26 also campaigned against the renovations during last year 's municipal elections the plan involved closing and selling two midtown branch libraries			1
their functions would have been consolidated inside the main research library at @entity76 and @entity10 , which would have become a circulating library			2
the @entity38 , which first reported the library 's about - face , said probable cost overruns were one factor in the decision			2
it said a study showed the project 's cost would have been significantly more than the $ 300 million originally budgeted			0
the renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the @entity10 building to storage in @entity25			0
scholars complained that moving so many books would have created hardships for researchers			0
the revised plan still will involve renovating the research library , formally known as the @entity94 , while keeping the stacks intact			2
the renovation was to have been partly financed with $ 150 million from the city budget			0
that money still will go to the library but now will be used for other purposes .			0
