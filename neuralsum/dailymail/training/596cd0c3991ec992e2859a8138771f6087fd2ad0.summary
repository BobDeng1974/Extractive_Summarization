rock samples that date three quarters of the way back to the birth of our planet suggest life may have flourished on early @entity7			0
chemical evidence hints that early microbes may have ‘ crawled ’ out of the ocean and lived on land by ' pulling ' nitrogen from the air 3.2 billion years ago			1
it was previously thought that the ability to use atmospheric nitrogen to support more widespread life appeared much later - roughly two billion years ago			1
rock samples that date three quarters of the way back to the birth of our planet , suggest life was flourishing on early @entity7 3.2 billion years ago , researchers claim			1
the oldest samples came from a site in north western @entity25 ( pictured ) while life can exist without oxygen , it needs nitrogen to build genes - essential to viruses , bacteria and all other organisms			2
without it , life on @entity7 would have been scarce			0
' people always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet , and it was n't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse , ’ explained @entity42 , professor of @entity7 and space sciences at the @entity44			0
‘ our work shows that there was no nitrogen crisis on the early @entity7 , and therefore it could have supported a fairly large and diverse biosphere			0
’ researchers analysed some of the oldest and best - preserved rocks on the planet			0
the samples ranged in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old and were collected in @entity55 and north western @entity25 , according to the study published in @entity57			1
chemical evidence hints that early microbes may have ‘ crawled ’ out of the ocean and lived on land by pulling nitrogen out of the air 3.2 billion years ago			1
a stock image of a mixture of microbes is shown the rocks were formed from sediment deposited on continental margins , so are free from chemical irregularities that would occur near a subsea volcano , for example			0
they also formed before the atmosphere gained oxygen , roughly 2.3 to 2.4 billion years ago , and therefore preserve chemical clues that have disappeared in modern rocks			1
the oldest samples showed chemical evidence that life was pulling nitrogen out of the air			1
a prehistoric sea creature living almost 250 million years ago , which was discovered near @entity83 in @entity84 , is believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water			2
the predators roamed @entity7 at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures			0
however , there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed			0
the ancient marine reptile called @entity98 , with seal - like flippers , may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea , scientists believe			0
they are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors , but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea			0
at 1.5ft ( 0.46 metres ) long , @entity111 lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur , meaning fish lizard			0
the ratio of heavier to lighter nitrogen atoms fits the pattern of nitrogen - fixing enzymes contained in single - celled organisms , but does not match any chemical reactions that occur in the absence of life			1
lead author @entity123 said : ‘ imagining that this really complicated process is so old , and has operated in the same way for 3.2 billion years , i think is fascinating			2
‘ it suggests that these really complicated enzymes apparently formed really early , so maybe it 's not so difficult for these enzymes to evolve ’ previous genetic analysis of nitrogen - fixing enzymes placed their origin at between 1.5 and 2.2 billion years ago			1
professor @entity42 said : ‘ this is hard evidence that pushes it back a further billion years			2
’ fixing nitrogen means breaking a tenacious triple bond , which holds nitrogen atoms in pairs in the atmosphere , and joining a single nitrogen to a molecule that is easier for living things to use			0
the chemical signature of the rocks suggests that nitrogen was being broken by an enzyme based on molybdenum			1
molybdenum is the most common of the three types of nitrogen - fixing enzymes that exist today			1
molybdenum is now abundant because oxygen reacts with rocks to wash it into the ocean , but its source on ancient @entity7 - before the atmosphere contained oxygen to weather rocks - is more mysterious			2
the authors suggest that its presence may be further evidence that some early life could have existed in single - celled layers on land , exhaling small amounts of oxygen that reacted with the rock to release molybdenum to the water			2
professor @entity42 said : ‘ we 'll never find any direct evidence of land scum one cell thick , but this might be giving us indirect evidence that the land was inhabited			0
’ ‘ microbes could have crawled out of the ocean and lived in a slime layer on the rocks on land , even before 3.2 billion years ago			1

chemical evidence hints early microbes may have moved out of the ocean and lived on land by pulling nitrogen out of the air 3.2 billion years ago
*experts* previously thought this happened over a billion years later
evidence was found in rocks collected in @entity25 and @entity55
chemical signature suggests nitrogen was being broken by an enzyme based on molybdenum - the most common type of nitrogen - fixing enzyme
