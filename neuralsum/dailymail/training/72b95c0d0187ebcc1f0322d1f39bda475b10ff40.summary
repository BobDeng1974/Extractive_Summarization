@entity12 , 22 , and her boyfriend @entity23 , 28 , forced her to ride the motorbike over three days , which lead to the four year old 's death who had massive head injuries			1
earlier in the inquest , evidence revealed how @entity12 , described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar , was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers , who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use			0

family members , including @entity12 's father , raised alarms about infant @entity4 's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother			2
but ms @entity123 believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was ' frequent conflict ' in @entity12 's family relationships			0
