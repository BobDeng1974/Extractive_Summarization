the book @entity0 : what statistics can tell us about sexual behaviour was released this week and it 's a must - read for anyone fascinated by who really does what , where , when and how in bed			1
the author , @entity11 , a @entity12 professor , sets out to investigate various sexual statistical claims and separate myth from reality			1
it 's prompted me to do the same			2
since no other part of the human body is more shrouded in myth and folklore than men 's most precious part , it seemed the penis was the most deserving subject to study			1
here 's what the latest research has to say : so , it is really six inches ? a new paper in the @entity39 is based on the results of scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size , including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world			1
most importantly , it was based only on studies where the penis had been measured by a trained health professional ( surprise , surprise : men are n't terribly honest or accurate when they measure it themselves )			1
the result : most men fall within just a couple of centimetres of each other , with most measuring around 5.2 inches in length when erect with a 4.6 inch circumference			2
if he wants to @entity64 , the correct way to measure a penis is to use a cloth measuring tape , not a straight - edged ruler			1
he should measure while it 's erect and measure the side facing his stomach , pushing the tape down to press against the pubic bone ( so he 's not measuring fat ! )			2
@entity76 investigate various sexual statistical claims and separates myth from reality the average time between penetration and him ejaculating ( for heterosexual couples ) is nine minutes			1
this was the result of a @entity87 study of 1,100 couples from 44 countries			0
each couple attempted intercourse at least twice a week for eight weeks and used a stop watch , clicking it on the minute he penetrated and clicking stop immediately after ejaculation			0
previous studies settled on between two or three minutes duration ; another rated the ' ideal time ' of intercourse for both men and women at between three and 13 minutes			0
the more he exercises , the stronger his erection			0
a new study in the @entity104 looked at how physical activity affected erectile functioning			0
men who exercised the most ( 18 hours a week ) had the highest sexual functioning scores			0
watching porn does n't affect his ability to perform			0
two reputable online surveys found no link between the use of pornography and erection problems , despite popular perception that watching too much porn leads to @entity119 ( erectile dysfunction )			0
what does make sense ( though , again not proven ) is that men who have difficulties turn to porn as a way of experiencing sex without embarrassment			1
great sex does not depend on a big penis			1
a study including opinions of 25 highly respected sex therapists identified eight elements that make up the best sex you can possibly expect			1
guess what ? the penis did n't even get a look in			1
the myth that big hands / big feet / big nose means a big penis has no scientific proof or evidence supporting it whatsoever			1
but height did make a difference : the taller the man , the longer his penis is likely to be			1
bald guys have a stronger sex drive			1
this may well have legs			0
the myth says bald men are more virile than men with hair because they have more testosterone in their body ( which can cause hair loss )			0
the testosterone / hair loss link is proven			0
baldness is caused when hair follicles become exposed to too much dihydrotestosterone ( @entity165 ) which is a chemical produced by the male hormone testosterone			0
testosterone is also the chemical responsible for his libido			0
the average number of erections per day for most men is seven			1
but five of these occur while he 's asleep			0
the penis has a safety - valve that ensures a man ca n't ejaculate and urinate at the same time			2
the average quantity of semen ejaculated is 3ml			2
the average speed of ejaculation is 28 miles per hour			2
the amount of blood in an erect penis is ten times more than when it 's flaccid			2
it shoots from 9ml flaccid to 90ml erect			0
one testicle hangs lower than the other to avoid them getting squashed when he walks ! eighty - five percent of men find their left testicle is lower and larger			0
