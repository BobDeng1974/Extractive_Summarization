by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:55 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:55 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 has broken the terms of its own health initiatives again , this time by publishing a fashion spread in @entity8 ’s november issue that features a 15 - year - old model			1
young @entity12 model @entity11 stars in the shoot looking every bit the @entity3 model in the story ’s mostly - blue clothes – but she does not fit the magazine ’s self - imposed rule of using faces that are older than 16			1
@entity11 ’s feature represents the third time that @entity3 ’s international editions have broken their health initiative by using young models			0
too young : @entity26 ( pictured on the cover of @entity28 ) , is a 15 - year - old @entity12 model who appeared in @entity8 , despite the magazine 's guideline not to use models under the age of 16 the @entity34 was established in 2012 to emulate similar guidelines that were being implemented across the global fashion industry – from @entity37 to the @entity38			1
but two months later , in @entity41 ’s august 2012 issue , 15 - year - old model @entity39 appeared in a fashion spread			2
the following month , another 15 - year - old , @entity43 , appeared in @entity45 ’s september issue			2
a fourth violation almost occurred around the same time when 14 - year - old @entity47 was photographed for @entity48			0
her shoot , however , was never published			0
regarding @entity11 ’s feature , @entity51 ’s editor @entity50 says that the magazine bought her spread as syndicated content and that it was unaware of the model ’s real age			1
she told @entity58 that the publication ‘ did not cast any models for this shoot , and was not involved in any manner with the production			1
’ syndicated content : @entity51 's editor says that the magazine was not involved in the production of @entity26 's shoot and that her photographs were purchased as syndicated content representatives for @entity51 have since contacted the shoot ’s photographer @entity70 ‘ to clarify this issue and identify exactly where the protocol failed in order to avoid this from ever happening again			1
’ but as mr @entity70 told the site : ‘ i am aware of the age restrictions with @entity87			0
i was not aware the model was 15 years of age			0
when we communicated with her agency in @entity12 they never mentioned that she was so young			2
we were all under the impression that she was 18 years or older , not 15			0
’ representatives for @entity11 's @entity12 agency @entity90 told @entity91 that they took care to make mr @entity70 aware of her age before she was hired			2
@entity11 ’s birth year ( 1998 ) is clearly labeled on the agency ’s website			0
her @entity98 bio also confirms her age , reading : ’ 15 yo polish model ... [ sic ] ’ at the time of @entity39 ’s feature in @entity41 , @entity106 ’s chairman and chief executive @entity102 said that the company was ‘ very serious ’ about its health initiative and that it would do ‘ everything possible to prevent future errors			0
’ @entity51 's oversight does not correlate with his comments .			1

@entity51 's editor says that the magazine was not involved in the shoot 's production and the photos were purchased as syndicated content
