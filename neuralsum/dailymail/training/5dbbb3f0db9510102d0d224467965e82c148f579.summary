an immigrant who suffered a stroke in a @entity3 hospital has woken up from a coma in @entity5 after being carted ' like a sack of potatoes ' to his homeland while unconscious			1
@entity9 is receiving treatment at a hospital in the town of @entity13 , despite having lived in the @entity14 for the past 30 years			1
@entity5 officials are furious after @entity16 in @entity17 deported the 69 - year - old , who had been living in @entity14 illegally , because he had no medical insurance			1
meanwhile , the @entity13 hospital claims mr @entity9 also lacks health insurance in @entity5 and his care is costing the medical facility ' a few hundred dollars ' a day			1
its director said the patient was ' dumped on the doorstep ' before they had even agreed to the transfer			1
patient : @entity9 , pictured , woke up from a coma in @entity5 after losing consciousness in @entity3 poor treatment : @entity9 , 69 , whose arm is pictured , is receiving treatment at a hospital in @entity5 , after he was sent to his home country after almost three decades in the @entity14 deported : mr @entity9 was deported from @entity16 in the @entity14 after it was discovered he was living in @entity14 illegally and had no medical insurance @entity5 consul general , @entity38 , said she and other diplomats were trying to help mr @entity9 , after the hospital suddenly shipped him overseas without informing his friends or family			1
they learned only last week that he was gone , ms @entity43 told the @entity45			0
' imagine being carted around like a sack of potatoes , ' she said			0
mr @entity9 is awake but unable to speak with doctors , the consul said			2
' he can smile from time to time , but he is unable to communicate , ' she added			0
the 69 - year - old suffers from a blood disease and lived for many years in @entity52 , near @entity53 in @entity3			2
he had lost his job in recent years , which , in turn , saw him lose his apartment			2
when he became sick , he was living in a local shelter , according to his friend , @entity58			2
' this is a very good man who i saw on a daily basis for some 12 years , ' mr @entity58 told the @entity45			1
mr @entity58 took mr @entity9 to the @entity17 hospital earlier this month and it was while he was in hospital that he suffered the stroke			1
@entity5 hospital : mr @entity9 is now in a hospital , pictured , in the @entity5 town of @entity13 no sign off : @entity69 and friends say they knew nothing of the man 's deportation until later and the @entity5 hospital , pictured , said he was n't in a fit state to agree to it himself @entity14 hospitals are legally bound to give emergency care to all , but can ship ' undocumented patients ' back to their homeland through a process called ' medical repatriation			1
' in order to do so the patient must be ' stabilized , ' which is not the equivalent of ' stable condition			0
' in many cases , the patient has an ongoing critical illness			0
the hospital must also get consent either from the patient , family or a court guardian			2
in mr @entity9 ’s case — first reported in the @entity5 - language paper @entity95 — consular officials say this did not happen			1
' it 's an incredibly disturbing case , ' @entity98 , director of the @entity99 at @entity100 told the @entity45			0
medical repatriation is a practice by which @entity14 hospitals deport critically ill or injured immigrant patients to , often inferior , hospitals in their home country			1
in many cases , the immigrant has been living in @entity14 for years , if not decades			1
in order to send them home , the hospital is required to get consent either from the patient , family or a court guardian			2
however , as in mr @entity9 's case , this does n't always happen			2
deportations are often carried out without the consent or knowledge of the courts			0
the hospitals generally use private planes and ambulances to carry the sick , who are often too ill , or scared , to object			0
the @entity124 at @entity100 and @entity125 recently revealed that more than 800 immigrants have been medically repatriation , or the hospital has at least tried to deport them , across the @entity14 since 2006			1
hospitals are only required to care for the sick immigrant until the patient is ' stabilized			0
' this is not equivalent to ' stable condition			0
' as such , many hospitals transfer patients in critical condition to free up beds and save money			2
but the immigrant generally ends up in an inferior hospital in their home country , putting their health at risk			2
with the standard procedure for deportation known as an order of removal , immigrants retain the right to appeal their ousting to the courts			2
but , with medical repatriation , patients have no recourse			2
' this kind of action seems clearly illegal and also not ethical , but it 's hard to bring a legal action			0
' a spokesman for the hospital said it had followed proper procedures — but refused to discuss the specific details of the case			0
' the individual was informed regarding his discharge plan and care			0
as the hospital 's understanding of the facts differs from the published reports , we are conducting a thorough review of the procedures and communications surrounding this gentleman 's care , ' said the spokesman			0
he said the hospital only repatriates patients if they are satisfied a health care provider in the patient 's home country will provide treatment			0
@entity184 and @entity185 plays no role in medical repatriations , which are paid for by hospitals themselves as way of ridding themselves patients that need costly , long term care			0
the @entity99 says @entity14 hospitals from at least 15 states have sent or attempted to send more than 800 immigrants back home since 2006			1
hospitals generally use private planes and ambulances to carry the sick who are often too ill to object			0
@entity16 reportedly transported mr @entity9 to @entity13 using a specially hired @entity205 and ambulance , after tracing his last known address to the town			0
@entity205 said such a flight could cost anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 100,000 depending on the number of personel and the type of equipment needed			0
the @entity13 hospital has confirmed the 69 - year - old was not in a fit state to sign off on the transfer			1
its deputy director , @entity219 , told a local tv station that the @entity14 hospital had contacted him regarding the transfer but before he agreed mr @entity9 was dumped on their doorstep			1
' his status in @entity5 is the same as in the @entity14			1
he is a @entity5 citizen without an address , without certification , pension and insurance , ' @entity219 told @entity230			1
he said that his care at the hospital is costing a few hundred dollars a day			0
officials are trying to find out from the @entity17 hospital the legal basis for sending the patient back to @entity5			1
' behind our backs they transported the unconscious man to @entity5 , ' @entity240 told @entity230			1
' i can not imagine such a situation that the decision about transporting an unconscious person could be made without agreement			0
between the two institutions must be a contract , there must be documents			0
you can not simply leave a patient at the door and drive away , ' she said			0
in another example of medical repatriation , the @entity254 last year obtained legal permission to deport @entity259 resident @entity258 to @entity5 after she suffered a stroke in 2009 that left her paralysed			1
flight : the hospital reportedly transported mr @entity9 to @entity13 using a specially hired @entity205 , though sometimes they use commercial flights , like that pictured the cleaner had originally come to the @entity14 in 1990 but stayed on after her original visa expired			1
she became paralysed as a result of the stroke and required 24 - hour care			0
the hospital asked around 30 other @entity14 medical facilities to take her in , but their request was denied each time			1
the hospital continued to treat her for two years despite her lack of medical insurance at a cost of $ 1million ( £ 650,000 )			1
eventually the hospital applied to the courts to force her to return to @entity5 , a country she had not seen for 22 years , leaving her son and grandchildren in the @entity14			1
' it 's hard to document how often it happens because it happens in the shadows , ' said @entity289 , director of the @entity290 told the @entity45			0
' we have been doing some outreach to consulates and are hearing that it happens with increasing frequency			0
' advocates fear repatriations will become more common from 2014 , when the @entity14 government , under the @entity298 , begins to reduce payments to hospitals that care for a disproportionate number of the uninsured .			2
