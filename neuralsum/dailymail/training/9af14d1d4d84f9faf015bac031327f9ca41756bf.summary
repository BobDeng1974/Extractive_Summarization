they compared the quantity of pain medication used by women with higher vitamin d levels to those of the women with lower vitamin d levels			1
the findings , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity34 in @entity35 , showed women with lower vitamin d levels required more pain medication than those with higher levels			1

the authors of the study noted an estimated 41 per cent of pregnant women in the @entity5 are deficient in vitamin d , with another 41 per cent having insufficient levels			1
dr @entity40 said : ' given the research results , prevention and treatment of low vitamin d levels in pregnant women may have a significant impact on decreasing labor pain in millions of women every year			2

@entity5 study examined 93 pregnant women as they gave birth
