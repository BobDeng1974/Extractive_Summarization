@entity0 was a visitor to the @entity1 on wednesday evening but it was he who showed the people of @entity5 a true cutting edge			1
his first goal was a thing of beauty , a sublime free kick that bounced into the top corner off the post , a strike the game ’s true artists would be proud of			2
but increasingly it is his ability to deliver in the heat of the furnace that impresses			0
sure , he ’s a fine player , but can he do it on a snowy wednesday night in @entity21 when there ’s a league cup final place at stake and time is ebbing away ? an acutely angled finish in the 88th minute to avoid extra time and secure a @entity29 showdown with @entity30 proved he can			0
it was the fourth time this season @entity0 has scored a winning goal in the 88th minute or later			1
he credits the work @entity34 did on his squad ’s fitness levels in pre-season with a propensity for late goals – the @entity40 is said to demand so much from his players in training that they require ‘ two hearts			0
’ @entity0 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity49 team - mates after their win at @entity51 @entity0 has certainly hit his stride working under @entity34			1
with every passing match , the £ 11million @entity49 paid for him in august 2013 is appearing to be more of a bargain			1
that was n’t always the case			0
although there were glimpses of his undoubted talent - he won the club ’s player of the year award in his first season - he did n’t burst onto the @entity63 stage in the way his reputation suggested he might			1
the 22 - year - old from @entity68 , @entity66 arrived in @entity69 from @entity70 with high expectations attached to him as one of the most highly rated youngsters in @entity75 ’s top flight			1
@entity0 began playing football as soon as he could walk and was soon marked out as one of the most gifted players in @entity68 , a town of less than 15,000 people on the island of @entity82			2
it was n’t long before he was picked up by @entity84 , the biggest club in @entity84 , the largest city on the island			0
@entity86 , the head of talent for @entity84 , remembers a special player			0
@entity0 curls home a sublime early free - kick to give @entity49 the lead on the night at @entity91 the @entity92 coolly slots past @entity94 goalkeeper @entity93 to send @entity49 on their way to @entity29 ‘ you could tell already he was something special			1
every time @entity99 moved to a higher level he needed just one or two games to cope with that and then become the best player , ’ @entity86 told @entity96 in 2013			0
he often played a couple of years ahead			0
‘ he steps up easily , this young guy taking over the whole game , setting the speed and shape of the game			0
@entity99 could play anywhere with good players			0
’ the playmaker flourished at @entity84 and was named ‘ the best technical player ’ in a major tournament in @entity66 as a 13 - year - old			0
representing @entity66 through the age groups , he piqued the interest of @entity119 ’s biggest clubs			1
@entity86 accompanied @entity0 as he travelled to @entity30 , @entity120 and @entity121 before he finally opted to join @entity70			1
@entity0 celebrates a goal against @entity123 during his @entity70 days in october 2012 although he was skinny and relatively small – he is now 5ft 10in – when he arrived at @entity70 , @entity125 who was in charge of youth development at the time was instantly impressed			1
‘ he 's always on the move			0
he has eyes in his back , ’ he said , ‘ when you think he does n't see you , he sees you			0
’ in 2010 , aged just 18 , @entity0 was the youngest player at the @entity137 in @entity138 , appearing twice as a substitute before @entity66 exited in the group stages			2
the next year , he was named @entity141 as @entity70 won the title			2
even when his team loses , @entity0 possesses skill that makes him sparkle			2
when @entity66 lost 2 - 1 to @entity69 in 2011 , @entity146 fans were preoccupied by the debut of @entity148 but @entity0 , one month the @entity151 star ’s junior , put him in the shade , repeatedly stealing the ball from under his nose and dictating the pace of play			1
@entity0 takes on @entity69 's @entity157 during an international friendly in @entity159 in february 2011 @entity160 and @entity30 were interested in signing him but it was @entity49 who secured his services , moving for him after their pursuit of @entity166 came to nothing			1
this term , he has been the club ’s standout performer and with eight goals is the @entity63 's top scoring midfielder , alongside @entity172			1
his rich vein of form has been noted by many of @entity119 ’s elite clubs			2
@entity177 , @entity121 and @entity178 are all thought to be interested in luring @entity0 to the contintent			2
domestically , @entity160 and @entity151 are also keen on the midfielder			0
@entity49 ' chances of holding onto him would surely improve if they can secure @entity183 football next season with a top four finish – and how they would dearly love to keep him at @entity186 .			1
