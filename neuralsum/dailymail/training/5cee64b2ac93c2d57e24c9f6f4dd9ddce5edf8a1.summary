later , @entity131 told @entity7 's @entity139 network that authorities had n't yet found a body or the scene where reports said a shootout took place			1
he never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be @entity2			0
but @entity151 spokeswoman @entity150 told @entity152 that one of the victims physically resembled the drug lord			1
she said officials had asked the @entity7 government to send @entity2 's fingerprints to compare them to the man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators			2
even then , @entity33 told the @entity152 that it was residents of the town of @entity164 who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like @entity2			0
@entity25 province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the @entity176 drug gang , a top rival for @entity2 's @entity94 drug cartel			1
