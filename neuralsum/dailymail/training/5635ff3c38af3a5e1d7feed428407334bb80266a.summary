a report obtained this week by the @entity1 revealed that publicity surrounding a police raid on sir @entity5 ’s home came about only because @entity6 revealed details of the raid to a @entity10 reporter the fundamental precept of @entity13 law , which protects and safeguards the liberty of every one of us , is that a man is deemed innocent until proven guilty			1
does this still hold good ? disturbingly , it appears not , particularly in the case of wealthy celebrities against whom unproven accusations are levelled			0
a damning , unpublished report obtained this week by the @entity1 under the @entity23 , says that the world - wide publicity surrounding a police raid on sir @entity5 ’s @entity28 home last august came about only because @entity6 revealed details of the raid to a @entity10 reporter , @entity30			1
at the time of the raid , no charge of any kind had been made against sir @entity5 , 74			1
a man in his 40s had simply accused the immensely popular singer of sexually molesting him in 1985 when he was a schoolboy under the age of 16 , at a rally in @entity40 held by the @entity42 evangelist @entity41			0
indeed , at the time , the police had not even spoken to sir @entity5 about the matter			1
he had no idea of the identity of his accuser , and the first he learned of the raid on his home was when he saw it on television at his estate in @entity54			2
even though the police have now interviewed sir @entity5 under caution , six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man			1
yet , as a result of the disgraceful conduct of @entity6 , and of the @entity10 , sir @entity5 ’s once spotless reputation has been damaged and besmirched by acres of newsprint world - wide , by sordid and sensational headlines , and by a giant question - mark in the minds of people who think there is ‘ no smoke without fire ’			1
i vividly recall the day i sat face to face with him , discussing long - standing rumours about his sexuality			0
it was may 1970 , and we were backstage at a theatre in @entity82 , @entity83 , where the singer — then plain mr @entity5 — was in rehearsal for his serious - acting stage debut			2
he had amazed the theatre world by daringly electing to portray a young gay man in @entity90 ’s play @entity91 , a character who falls in love with his male tutor			2
my questions were tentative , and he picked up on this immediately			0
an expression of knowing mischief crossed his face			0
‘ you want to know if i ’m gay in real life , ’ he said			0
‘ well i ’m not			0
i ’ve been telling people that for years , but they never believe me			0
’ @entity5 was then 29 and had been a major star for more than a decade since his recording of @entity105 ’s song , @entity106 , went to @entity107 in the charts in 1959 and established him as an ersatz @entity110 version of @entity111			2
with his slicked - back dark hair , swarthy looks , chocolate - brown eyes and gyrating hips , he introduced an entirely new style of sex appeal into @entity110 showbusiness , and rumours about his hotly debated sexual inclinations swirled around him from the beginning			0
a @entity10 news crew had reported from the entrance to the @entity125 estate in @entity126 , near @entity127 , @entity28 where @entity5 owns a property during the raid although no charges had been made against him in 1964 , he very publicly embraced @entity131 , drastically remodelled his image and became the @entity133 of @entity134 and @entity110 ’s mr @entity135			1
sexually , he was to remain an enigma , and his private affairs have long been a subject of intrigue and fascination			0
for 30 years he lived with his business manager @entity141 , who had a girlfriend , @entity143 , although she left him eventually			0
for the past 13 years @entity5 has shared his various homes with a burly , gruff @entity145 and former @entity147 priest , @entity148 , whom he insists is simply a friend and companion			2
the point is that whether sir @entity5 is gay , straight , bisexual or — as his biographer , @entity155 , concluded after exhaustive interviewing , ‘ asexual ’ — none of this makes him a paedophile			1
of course , where there is strong and persuasive evidence of child abuse or of sex crimes then cases must go to trial			0
but , i repeat , no charges have been made against sir @entity5 who has described the allegation of sexual molestation as ‘ completely false ’			1
yet on the strength of his pre-eminence as an entertainer and the shocking collusion between @entity6 and the @entity10 , which so pruriently filmed the raid , the allegation has been flung across the world virtually unchallenged , at appalling cost to his reputation			1
meanwhile , sir @entity5 ’s accuser — who waited almost 30 years to come forward — shelters behind the cloak of anonymity offered him by our legal system			1
the first sir @entity5 learned of the raid on his @entity28 home ( pictured ) was when he saw it on television at his estate in @entity54 i ca n’t help but wonder whether there is something opportunistic about the timing of the allegation			1
after all , sir @entity5 ’s fortune is estimated to be in excess of £ 40million , and in the wake of the conviction and imprisonment for sex abuse of the publicist @entity200 and the entertainer @entity201 , the air is heavy with talk of claims for compensation for long - ago abuses			1
the report unearthed by the @entity1 pulls no punches			0
independent investigator and former chief constable @entity209 is harshly critical of @entity6 for leaking details of a ‘ highly sensitive and confidential ’ investigation to the @entity10			1
the report also reveals that the chief constable of @entity214 , @entity215 , was informed of the leak and ‘ could have rescinded the agreement ’ with the @entity10			2
he failed to do so			0
the belated admission by @entity6 that their actions were ‘ ultimately flawed ’ , and that they ‘ regret the additional anxiety which was caused to sir @entity5 ’ , comes nowhere near to resolving this matter			1
and although the @entity10 , with its customary arrogance , insists ‘ the @entity226 has already endorsed the way the @entity10 handled the story ; we have nothing further to add ’ , they still have a great deal to answer for			2
for the distress caused to sir @entity5 is just one element of this outrage			1
the actions of the police and of the @entity10 have militated against the possibility of the singer ever receiving a fair trial should the @entity240 ( @entity240 ) bring a charge			2
police had carried out the raid in connection with allegations that the singer had molested a schoolboy under the age of 16 , in 1985 , but no charges had been made against sir @entity5 and though the police have now interviewed him under caution , six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man in any case , questions are being asked about the cps			1
after the police and justice system failed so abysmally to prosecute @entity259 when he was alive , there seems to have been a desire to atone for this failure by pointing the finger at any celebrity accused by anyone of sexual abuse — and dragging their name through the mud			1
and i believe the @entity240 , by single - mindedly pursuing prosecutions in such cases , encouraged this			0
it was the cps that was behind the trials on sex offence charges of three @entity277 stars , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280			0
while these men were clearly not knights in shining armour , their cases all ended in humiliating ‘ not - guilty ’ fiascos costing millions to the taxpayer			0
meanwhile , the police have in recent times launched highly publicised investigations into big - name celebrities such as @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 , against whom no charges have been brought			2
sir @entity5 , i believe , is made of sterner stuff than all the rest			1
a highly astute businessman with a strong sense of justice , he was the prime mover in getting the copyright in music recordings extended from 50 to 70 years , ensuring that entertainers benefited as a result			0
it is now known as ‘ @entity308 ’			0
if he decides to sue for the undoubted damage that has been caused to him , it could cost the @entity10 and the police millions			2
this story is far from over .			0

new report has been published into police raid on sir @entity5 ’s home
finds publicity only came about because police revealed details to @entity10
criticises @entity6 for leaking highly sensitive investigation
no charges of sexual abuse have ever been brought against @entity5
@entity327 warned a lawsuit could cost police and @entity10 millions
