by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 likened the excitement around his first @entity5 2014 experience to a @entity7 stage after finishing eighth in the time trial			1
the @entity10 goes into sunday 's road race with greater expectations for himself but the atmosphere on roads in @entity5 , @entity15 and @entity16 exceeded his wildest dreams			1
the 37 - year - old came into the @entity19 looking for a special experience to help bring the curtain down on his career and the welcome did not disappoint			1
similarities : scot @entity2 compared the @entity19 time trial to a @entity7 stage excited : @entity2 came eighth in thursday 's time trial and says the @entity5 experience has been amazing @entity2 said : ' it was like a @entity7 stage out there , it really was			1
' the amount of people out there with @entity38 flags and my name being cheered , i have never experienced anything like it			0
i think it 's going to be more of the same on sunday			2
' there were moments out there when it was just deep with people , and the noise was incredible			0
it really was like a @entity7 stage			2
' i was very proud and everyone else can be			0
it was blurs of @entity54 , it was pretty impressive			0
it was quite strange seeing so many @entity38 flags out there			0
' @entity2 had not held out much hope of retaining the title he won in @entity59 four years ago and he was never in contention , eventually finishing two minutes and 14 seconds behind @entity62 winner @entity61 and almost two minutes behind @entity64 bronze medallist @entity63			2
' i had pretty low expectations and i fulfilled those , ' he said			0
dream finish : @entity2 hopes to claim a medal for @entity38 in sunday 's road race familiar : @entity2 came third on the same course around @entity5 last year in the @entity71 national championships ' i just wanted to get through it			1
i was super-realistic about today , i know where my forte lies now and it 's not so much in time trials these days at my old age			2
so i 'm looking forward to the road race			1
' @entity2 believes home support can be much more of a weapon on sunday			1
the @entity79 - born @entity10 finished third in the same course around the city centre and the west end of @entity5 in the @entity83 last summer , and led coming into @entity84 before being overtaken in the home straight by sprint specialist @entity86 , who misses these games through injury			1
' the road race is a lot different , ' he said			1
' you have time to soak it up and you have to go pretty deep and tap into all your resources			0
so i think having the home crowd on sunday is going to make a big difference			0
' i know what to expect , which is good , but i also know how hard it is			0
and it does n't matter what the course is , every race is different			0
' i think we have a real quality field there and it 's going to be really aggressive from the gun			0
' it 's not going to be a boring race , that 's for sure			2
' punishing : @entity2 put in a solid performance in the gruelling time trial as he finished in eighth place roads : @entity2 is familiar with the course around @entity5 ahead of sunday 's road race			1

@entity2 likened the excitement around @entity5 as similar to @entity7
@entity10 will also ride in sunday 's road race hoping to grab a medal
@entity2 will retire after the @entity19 so he is hoping to go out on a high
@entity79 - born @entity10 finished third on same course last year in @entity5
