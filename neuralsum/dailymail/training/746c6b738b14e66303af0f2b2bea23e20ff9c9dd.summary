by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 : 06:37 est , 26 february 2013 what does @entity3 have against the @entity5 ? once again on @entity6 night , @entity3 gave warmly with one hand — while cynically taking away with the other			1
the good news is that at least nine @entity5 will fly back across the @entity10 with coveted golden statues			1
but the bad news is that @entity13 — the movie that won @entity15 — is yet another piece of @entity3 ’s @entity18 - bashing junk history that casts the @entity5 in a poor light			1
although the movie is a cracker — tense and terrifying — like so much that comes out @entity3 , @entity13 plays fast and loose with the facts			2
and unsurprisingly , the brits are given a real pasting			0
for , according to the @entity22 version of the rescue mission , the six embassy staff were refused refuge by @entity5 diplomats			1
‘ brits turned them away , ’ says a senior @entity38 character in the film			2
you can imagine the outraged comments over industrial buckets of popcorn in movie theatres from @entity62 to @entity63			0
‘ @entity64 ! so that ’s what we get for bailing them out during @entity68 ’ the truth , however , could not be more different			0
the @entity5 did give their @entity30 colleagues sanctuary			1
far from being cowards , the @entity55 were heroes			0
many of the @entity5 diplomats then stationed in @entity27 are still alive — and they ’re fuming			1
‘ when i first heard about this film , i was really quite annoyed , ’ says sir @entity73 , 86 , who was in @entity74 at the time of the crisis			2
sir @entity73 is understandably concerned that @entity13 will become accepted as the definitive history of what happened			2
he may have a point			0
the movie also stars ' breaking @entity84 ' star @entity83 ( left ) remember u- 571 — the @entity87 thriller set in @entity68 — which saw the @entity88 , and not the @entity5 and the @entity89 , capture an @entity91 coding machine and turn the course of the war ? or how about the abysmal piece of faux - history that was @entity97 ’s @entity96 , which depicted the @entity5 as the rapacious , murderous oppressors of the noble and romantic @entity100 ? who can forget @entity102 , @entity103 ’s @entity68 epic , that effectively presented @entity104 as an exclusively @entity30 effort ? the sad irony is that what really happened in @entity74 in 1979 is just as thrilling as @entity13 , if not more so — and it involved astonishing @entity5 pluck			1
@entity22 may have won the @entity6 for @entity15 , but the movie wo n't be picking up any awards for being historically accurate anytime soon when the @entity29 was overrun by armed students on november 4 , 1979 , five members of staff managed to escape by a side exit			1
the remaining 55 embassy staff were to be held captive for a further 444 days			1
the most senior member of the escaped group was @entity118 , who worked in the visa department			0
he decided the best place to find refuge was the @entity122			2
the group made its way through the bustling streets , only to find the @entity5 embassy was also surrounded by an angry mob			1
thinking on his feet , @entity118 quickly took the group back to his flat and from there tried to contact anybody who might help rescue them			0
after a tense night , a call came through from the @entity5 embassy informing the five terrified @entity30 that it could give them refuge in its residential compound , which was known as @entity136			1
as @entity13 neglects to mention , this was an exceedingly brave offer			0
both the @entity5 embassy and residential compounds were under serious threat			1
after what had happened to the @entity30 , the @entity5 understandably feared an attack on their own staff			1
the @entity27 revolutionaries had dubbed @entity5 the ‘ @entity145 ’ , and for our officials to shelter diplomats from the ‘ @entity145 ’ ( @entity30 ) meant running a huge risk			1
the caller told @entity118 that a @entity5 car would come for them later that morning			1
the @entity30 sat and waited			2
what the five anxious @entity30 could not have known was that the @entity5 rescuers had got @entity155 and @entity156 spent hours fruitlessly negotiating the thronging streets in , of all cars , an orange 1976 @entity159 one of them had driven to @entity74 all the way from @entity162			1
but they were unable to find @entity118 ’s flat			0
at around 5pm , the @entity30 called the @entity5 embassy , only to be told by a diplomat that the @entity27 were ‘ coming over the walls ’			1
a @entity30 hostage , blindfolded and with his hands bound , being displayed to the crowd outside the @entity171 in @entity74 by @entity27 hostage - takers in 1979 the @entity26 revolution in @entity27 in 1979 saw demonstrators climb the wall of the @entity171 to burn a flag in defiance indeed they were			1
for as the city grew dark , an army of students invaded the embassy compound			2
they broke into offices and houses , smashing windows and doors			0
among those who witnessed the attack was @entity189 , wife of the @entity190 , @entity191			0
that night , @entity192 was in her house with her son , @entity194 , who was aged just seven			0
‘ my little boy was terrified , and so was i , ’ she recalls			0
‘ we hid in my bedroom , but then i decided that was not a great place to hide , in case they set fire to the house			0
’ @entity192 left her room , hiding @entity194 under her coat			0
she was soon accosted by six students , all clutching kalashnikovs , one of whom she swore could be no older than 12			0
‘ i thought they were going to shoot me , ’ she says , ‘ but when i realised that they were n’t , i grew angry with them , and asked them if their mothers knew they were out ! ’ along with the other @entity5 embassy staff and their wives and children , @entity192 and @entity194 were taken to a single building where they were held captive			1
although he was in @entity223 at the time , the ambassador sir @entity73 today suspects the students who attacked the @entity5 embassy were looking for the @entity30			1
‘ they claimed they were after arms , ’ says sir @entity73 , ‘ but i do n’t think that was true			0
’ the 10 @entity30 hostages being presented to the media at the occupied @entity30 @entity29 shortly before their release the @entity30 hostages being paraded outside the @entity171 in @entity74 in 1979 meanwhile , @entity155 and @entity156 had finally found @entity118 and his group after hours of driving around the backstreets of @entity74			2
the @entity30 were taken in an edgy drive to the as - yet - untouched @entity5 residential compound			1
‘ the @entity30 were very nervous , ’ @entity155 recalls , ‘ and they kept trying to duck down , which in my view would only look suspicious			2
’ happily , they arrived at @entity241 and received a warm welcome			0
as the @entity38 officer @entity248 , who helped to mount the eventual rescue , recalls in his book , @entity13 : ‘ the @entity5 were kind hosts , and offered them a house of their own , fed them a warm meal , even prepared cocktails			2
’ so much for @entity22 ’s suggestion that the @entity5 ‘ turned away ’ the @entity30			1
@entity155 ’s wife @entity252 cooked that meal and the @entity30 went to bed			2
but while they slept , the @entity27 students were approaching @entity136			0
fired up with the success of storming the @entity5 embassy , they were now ready to seize the residential compound			1
standing at the gate was a @entity260 guard in his 50s called @entity262 , who brilliantly convinced the students the compound was empty — and they went away			0
‘ we and the @entity30 had a very lucky escape , ’ says @entity155			2
‘ we were very grateful to @entity262			0
’ the following morning it was decided the @entity30 would have to move on for their own safety			2
@entity118 and his group were told that they would have to go , as @entity136 was clearly not secure			0
according to the account written by @entity248 , the @entity30 felt they were ‘ being kicked out ’ by the @entity5 , but @entity155 says this is not the case , as the reasons for leaving @entity136 were ‘ self - evident ’			1
freed @entity30 hostages , landing at @entity274 after a flight from @entity27 on their way home to the @entity30 @entity13 tells the story of how 6 @entity30 diplomats were rescued from the occupied @entity30 embassy during the 1979 revolution for a few days the five @entity30 were placed in an empty house belonging to a @entity30 official , where they were joined by a colleague who had also escaped from the embassy and had been in hiding			1
this group of six was eventually saved by the rescue mission organised by the @entity37 and the @entity38			0
after the rescue , the story remained secret , kept in classified files			0
however , the diplomatic community knew the @entity5 — and others — had done their bit			2
a recently - released @entity294 from february 6 , 1980 , states that the @entity5 embassy was involved in the rescue of the @entity30			1
many of the @entity5 embassy staff from that time have seen @entity13			1
‘ it does not bear all that much relation to the facts , ’ observes sir @entity191 drily			0
‘ it is not a true story			0
’ @entity22 has acknowledged the film casts @entity5 in a bad light			1
‘ but i was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go			0
it does not mean to diminish anyone , ’ he said			0
such a defence cuts little ice with sir @entity73			0
‘ i ca n’t see why the film - makers could n’t have acknowledged that we and others did actually help the diplomats , ’ he says			1
‘ it would n’t have ruined the drama at all			0

in the film six @entity30 embassy staff were refused refuge by @entity5 diplomats - quite the *opposite* of what happened
