by @entity0 published : 02:26 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:51 est , 3 february 2014 @entity4 fans were outraged about the the price of @entity7 concessions in @entity8 , @entity9 -- especially the price of normally inexpensive beverages like hot chocolate			1
astonishingly , hot chocolate was priced at the exorbitant amount of $ 11.00			1
if fans wanted to buy hot chocolate in a souvenir cup it would have cost them nearly twice the price at $ 20.00			1
the high price of eating dinner at the @entity4 and of ordering a hot chocolate was comical to say the least premium canned beer was $ 14.00 and those who wanted bottled beer and wine had to dig into their wallets for $ 12.00 , reports @entity27			1
the souvenir soup mug was just as expensive as hot chocolate and cost $ 20.00 as well			1
one @entity31 reporter joked on twitter about the soup mug and wrote , ' yes , prices are outrageous			2
but i have another question			0
who goes to a # superbowl concession stand and orders soup ? ' the stadium cheese steaks were next expensive at $ 16.00			0
the meatball sub followed closely behind at $ 13.00			0
@entity42 n ' cheese was one of the more ' reasonable ' food items on the menu costing around $ 8.00			0

' for some , the @entity4 put a super hole in their pockets			0
other fans enjoyed less expensive food from the comfort of their own warm homes			0
@entity76 of @entity31 thought the expensive soup pricing was laughable selling your first born is not advised , nor might it cover the cost of hot chocolate in a souvenir cup the price of beer made the thought of purchasing it very unappealing ... especially is it meant missing game time to go to the bathroom			1

concessions at @entity7 climbed as high as $ 20.00 for hot chocolate in a souvenir mug that without the mug cost the high price of $ 11.00
beer was priced from $ 12.00 to $ 14.00
@entity51 users , *including* *sportscasters* , *blasted* the astonishingly high prices on their pages
