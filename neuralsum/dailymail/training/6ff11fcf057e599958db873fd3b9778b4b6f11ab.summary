unwanted food donated so far ranges from bread and broccoli to caviar , truffles , a kilo of smoked salmon , luxury cheeses , extravagant veg and spices			1

one of the cafe 's directors @entity24 , 23 , said : ' we get a real mix here from locals in the areas , who come in a spend the day here to students			1
' we are very busy and are probably doing between 15 to 30 meals a day			1
' the pay as you feel concept makes people think about what is offer and what they think it is worth			0
' we like to think if somebody has a little more money they might pay a little more			0
' but if a person did not have the means to pay we are not going to not serve them , if they are hungry we are going to give them food			2
