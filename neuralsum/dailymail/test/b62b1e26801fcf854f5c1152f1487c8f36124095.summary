a @entity0 candidate has thanked @entity1 for not visiting his seat because he said it would turn off voters			1
@entity5 , who is standing in @entity0 - held @entity6 , said the deputy prime minister was ' not the most popular '			1
he said that a visit from the party leader to the seat , which is currently held by the @entity0 , would not ' do us any favours '			1
mr @entity1 has seen a dramatic collapse in his popularity since the heyday of the 2010 election campaign when he was lauded as being more popular than @entity23			0
the party secured 23 per cent of the vote in the 2010 election			0
since taking the @entity0 into government and breaking his promise to scrap tuition fees , the party 's poll ratings have slumped to single figures			0
most @entity34 are choosing to keep mr @entity1 off their leaflets and instead campaign on local issues			0
mr @entity5 told @entity37 : ' i think that @entity1 coming to @entity6 might be a little bit of a double - edged sword for us			1
' he ’s not the most popular politician in the mainstream political circuit at the moment and i ’m not convinced that his presence here would actually do us many favours			0
' after the interview , the @entity0 issued a 121 word statement on mr @entity5 's behalf praising mr @entity1 for having ' real guts '			1
mr @entity1 is touring the country in a bright yellow battlebus , which stopped off in @entity54 yesterday where he campaigned with leader of the @entity57 @entity56 ( pictured ) mr @entity5 said he was now in ' no doubt ' that mr @entity1 would be ' well received ' if he paid a visit			1
the statement said : ' @entity1 has shown real guts as our party leader and is someone i admire and respect			2
' as deputy prime minister he delivered tax cuts for low earners , more jobs and apprenticeships , and ensured real investment has come to @entity6 after decades of neglect by @entity74 and the @entity75			2
' whilst this real difference to real people ’s lives has not always been given a fair hearing in the mainstream political circuit , the election campaign at last gives @entity1 and our party a chance to be heard directly by the public			0
' as such i have no doubt that if @entity1 now came to @entity6 and met all the people who have benefited from having the @entity57 in government he would be well received			0
' ‎ the @entity0 won the @entity6 seat with a 5,000 strong majority in 2010 but mp @entity90 has stepped down			2
mr @entity1 faces a tough fight to keep hold of his @entity94 seat and polls have predicted his party could lose more than half of its mps			2
