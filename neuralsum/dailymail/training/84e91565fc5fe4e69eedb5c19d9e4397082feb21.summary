last year , 12 - year - old @entity0 missed over 100 days of school due to a painful gastrointestinal syndrome			1
while the seventh - grader 's health issues are still not over , his life is beginning to return to normal thanks to a robot that allows him to attend classes and socialize with his peers all from the comfort of his home			1
this year , @entity0 became the first student in @entity14 to use a @entity15 , a robot which he can steer from class to class to watch lectures and even interact with his teachers and classmates via a webcam that transmits his image on the robot 's screen			1
if @entity0 wants to ask or answer a question , he simply pushes a button which flashes a light , alerting his teacher			2
the robots cost $ 12,000 each ' being there makes it much easier than not being there			1
i 'm a very hands - on kind of person , ' @entity0 told @entity46			2
' i feel like i 'm very lucky to get such an experience , because otherwise i 'd just be sitting here 12 hours a day doing absolutely nothing			0
' the @entity32 was the first district in the state to invest in the cutting - edge technology , buying three of the $ 12,000 robots for sick students			1
one of the robots is being used by a little girl with a compromised immune system , who now gets to attend kindergarten and socialize with children her age for the first time			0
@entity63 , chief communications officer for the school district , told @entity65 that they are proud to be the first to invest in the robots for their students			0
' one of the things we started noticing was that there were kids who really wanted to be in school but could n’t for medical reasons , ' @entity74 said			0
' @entity0 is the perfect candidate for this new technology			2
it ’s just been really inspiring to watch him			0
' back to school : 12 - year - old @entity0 is one of three students using a @entity15 in @entity32			1
he steers his from home to attend two classes a day at the @entity82 , a magnate school not missing out : @entity0 is even able to ask his teachers a question by pressing a button which flashes a light to draw attention to his camera just like everyone else : above , @entity0 is seen sitting in on a class , listening to the teacher 's lecture alongside another student for @entity0 , missing out on school was even more disappointing since he won a spot to the @entity82 through a lottery			1
now he 's back at the magnate school to attend four different classes , two each day , which he supplements with an at - home math class and home - bound tutor provided to him through the @entity103			1
@entity0 's mother @entity104 says the technology has made a world of difference in her son 's life			2
' it was almost like homework prison for him before , and now , he 's doing projects with kids			0

' i want my child to be a normal kid and the @entity15 lets him be a normal kid			0
