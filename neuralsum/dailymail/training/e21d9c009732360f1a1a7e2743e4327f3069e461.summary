by @entity0 published : 03:38 est , 3 august 2013 @entity2 : 03:59 est , 3 august 2013 misconception : @entity5 's new book claims that the ' @entity8 ' image featuring lord kitchener was never actually used on recruitment posters it 's the iconic poster that is said to have been the call to arms that millions of young men to sign up for the @entity14 in @entity15			1
but an art expert turned historian has cast doubt over the authenticity of lord @entity20 's famous ' @entity8 ' as a recruitment poster			1
in a new book @entity5 , who has researched the history of recruitment posters , has claimed that the public perception that the image of @entity20 pointing a finger encouraged swathes of men to go off and fight in the trenches is a misconception			1
in the book , entitled @entity8 , he says that his research shows that the image was never used for official recruitment purposes and not widely produced as a poster			1
mr @entity5 , a former @entity39 paintings specialist at a @entity41 auctioneers , studied records of the @entity43 which produced war time posters in the @entity45 at @entity46			1
despite the records showing nearly 200 official recruitment posters used during the @entity15 , the @entity20 poster is absent from the archives			1
he also looked at several thousand images of street scenes and recruitment offices taken during the war and found no trace of the poster			1
he says that the image was first used on the cover of @entity60 magazine and designed by graphic artist @entity61			1
the magazine then offered its readers the opportunity to buy postcards of the image for 1s 4d for 100 - but mr @entity5 has been unable to track down any surviving postcards			1
the image was catalogued by mistake in the @entity70 's poster collection when it acquired the artwork in 1917 leading to the public 's misconception over its use			1
even the wording associated with the image has changed over the decades			2
the original design featured an image of @entity20 and the words ' wants you ' underneath followed by ' join your country 's army ! @entity83 '			2
icon : lord @entity20 , pictured during the @entity15 , was appointed secretary of state for war in 1914 but the words have changed to ' your country needs you ' in later reproductions			0
he told the @entity91 : ' the image 's influence now is absolutely out of all kilter with the reality of its initial impact			2
' it has taken on a new kind of life			0
it is such a good image and , saying that , it was later seized upon			2
' born in @entity102 in june 1850 , lord @entity20 was secretary of state for war in the first years on @entity15			0
he joined the @entity103 at the age of 21 and was appointed governor general of eastern @entity106 in 1886			0
he became commander in chief of the @entity109 army in 1892 and was eventually made governor of @entity106			0
in 1900 , @entity20 was appointed as chief of staff to @entity112 , @entity113 commander in the @entity114			0
at war : the image had been credited with helping to recruit millions of young men to fight in the trenches @entity112 returned to @entity119 and @entity20 was left to cope with much @entity121 resistence			2
his means of dealing with the resistance were much criticised - they included the use of camps to imprison civilians , the origin of the term ' concentration camp ' which is more associated with @entity130			0
despite the controversy , he was made a @entity132 on his return to @entity119 in 1902 and became commander in chief in @entity135 then proconsul of @entity109			0
he was made secretary of state for war when fighting broke out in 1914 and set up recruiting huge numbers of volunteers to be trained as part of a succession of new ' @entity20 armies '			0
he was gradually stripped of his responsibilities by the government and he drowned in june 1916 when his ship @entity146 was sunk by a @entity148 mine off the @entity150 islands .			0

@entity5 's new book says the image was never used as a recruitment poster
his research shows that the image was produced by a graphic designer for a magazine
