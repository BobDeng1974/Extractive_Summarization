by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 is hoping for positive news this week on the knee injury to @entity6 that could mean a ‘ long , long ’ lay - off for the attacking midfielder			1
but @entity9 , the man who replaced the 20 - year - old @entity11 player on saturday and scored in the 2 - 2 curtain raiser at @entity13 , insists there was no doom and gloom around the club about @entity6 ’s situation			1
@entity6 suffered a tear to the medial ligament in his right knee in training on friday and initial scan results on saturday morning led @entity2 to say his rising star could miss between seven weeks and five months			1
that ’s the biggest draw percentage ever between any two @entity45 teams who ’ve met 10 times or more			2
in his absence @entity9 played in a support role behind @entity3 ’s £ 28million record signing @entity53 , and scored his side ’s second goal after @entity58 ’s opener			1
@entity13 ’s record £ 8m signing @entity59 scored their first equaliser and 22 - year - old @entity62 sub @entity38 got the second late on			1
‘ everybody was ready for the game , people were n’t thinking “ oh no , @entity6 is n’t playing , it ’s going to be a disaster ” , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ if you look at our bench , we ’ve got @entity71 and @entity72			0
these guys are well established players who missed out			0
we ’ve definitely got enough players to cover it and excel in those positions as well			0
’ first blood : @entity58 curled @entity3 into the lead against the newly - promoted side level terms : @entity13 's new £ 8m signing @entity59 pulled them level on his @entity45 debut all square : @entity38 rescued @entity13 a point with just four minutes remaining video we should 've won - @entity2 @entity9 said the ‘ @entity6 role ’ was also ‘ where i feel most comfortable ’			1
he added : ‘ towards the end of last season i played a lot in there and @entity6 played wider			2
i grew up as a striker and i still react and move as a striker when the ball goes in the box			0
’ @entity2 is confident @entity6 ’s injury is not at the most serious end of the spectrum , categorically ruling out that it could last through the season			1
‘ no , no , no , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re expecting the next set of scans on wednesday or thursday just to make sure there is not inflammation in the knee			2
' we ’ll know exactly then but as i said medial ligament can go from six weeks to a longer period			0
in any case it ’s not an injury that should rule him out for the season			0
’ @entity2 accepts such absences happen although acknowledges @entity6 will be missed			2
‘ we all share the same problems			0
[ but ] it ’s important that we get @entity6 back fully fit as quick as we can			2
upbeat : @entity3 boss @entity2 believes @entity6 's injury will not rule him out for the season responsibility : @entity53 was pressed into a full 90 minutes of action against @entity13 ' september is going to be a very busy month and without @entity6 it ’s going to put a lot of strains and more pressure on other players			1
’ @entity53 played 90 minutes he would almost certainly not have played if @entity6 had been available			2
‘ obviously with the injury to @entity6 we needed @entity127 to take a bit more responsibility in that attacking role and i could n't be prouder of his effort and the way he stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes , ’ @entity2 said			1
he reiterated @entity53 ’s huge fee should not be a burden but a confidence booster			0
‘ the fee is one way to show how much we perceive him , how much we love him			0
and i do n’t think that is a weight of expectation			0
