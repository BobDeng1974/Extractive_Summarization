@entity1 's biggest banks earmarked billions of pounds for ' remediation costs ' and fines over the last three years @entity1 's biggest banks have racked up a £ 39billion bill in just three years to pay for their financial scandals			1
‘ remediation costs ’ wiped out 61 per cent of their profits between 2011 and 2014 , according to accountants @entity8			0
the bill has been driven by the payment protection insurance scandal , with banks setting aside £ 4.7billion last year to compensate customers			1
another £ 2.3billion was earmarked by banks including @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 to pay fines for rigging foreign exchange markets			1
the total charge for wrongdoing last year – £ 9.9billion – was only 8 per cent less than the previous year			1
describing it as a ‘ problem that wo n’t go away ’ , @entity8 said banks also face mounting costs from employing an army of compliance staff to keep them out of trouble			2
@entity15 is thought to be facing a multibillion - pound settlement in the @entity28 for mis - selling toxic bundles of mortgage debt – known as mortgage - backed securities – in the run up to the financial crisis			0
@entity14 is also braced for a huge fine for rigging foreign exchange rates , having put aside £ 1.25billion so far to cover the bill			1
but the @entity1 ’s strengthening economy has driven a 72 per cent drop in losses from bad loans , with write - offs falling to £ 5.2billion last year			1
@entity15 was boosted by £ 1.4billion after not as many loans went sour as it had feared			2
this compares with an £ 8.1billion charge in 2013			1
so - called ‘ impairment charges ’ at @entity50 fell £ 2billion to £ 752million as the improving economy meant fewer retail customers and businesses defaulted on their repayments			2
@entity15 ’s losses narrowed to £ 3.5billion last year from £ 8.2billion in 2013			2
@entity14 , @entity16 and @entity57 all saw profits fall			0
@entity8 said banks must ‘ urgently tackle ’ their low return on equity – a key measure of shareholder value – and need to invest in technology to increase their profits			0
tougher regulations forcing them to hold more capital have made it more expensive for them to do business , especially in higher - risk areas			0
banks including @entity15 and @entity14 have responded by shrinking their investment banking arms			0
@entity8 ’s @entity73 said : ‘ banks are undergoing a once in a lifetime change , as they face evolving regulation , technology and society ’s expectations … if further regulation creates too many strictures on non-retail banking , the industry risks losing its global relevance			0
