by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 is harvesting thousands of votes from the @entity5 , @entity2 boasted yesterday			1
he said his anti-eu agenda and tough line on immigration was proving increasingly attractive to supporters of the far - right party , and had already persuaded a third of them to switch their allegiance			0
the @entity3 leader insisted he had ‘ no truck ’ with the @entity5 ’s ‘ racist agenda ’ and said he was ‘ proud ’ to be attracting its voters			1
speaking at an event at @entity21 , in @entity22 , he said : ‘ we are saying to @entity5 voters , if you are voting @entity5 because you are frustrated , upset with the change in your community but you are doing it holding your nose , because you do n’t agree with their racist agenda , come and vote for us			1
‘ i would think that we have probably taken a third of the @entity5 vote directly from them			2
’ @entity5 candidates secured 940,000 votes in the @entity36 elections in 2009 , but the party ’s support has slumped since then			1
@entity3 leader @entity2 said no one had done more than him to tackle the @entity5 mr @entity2 ’s comments came as @entity41 claimed @entity3 exploited the same ‘ politics of blame ’ as @entity43 ’s far - @entity42 , which inflicted heavy defeats on the ruling socialists in local elections at the weekend			1
the @entity50 leader said both parties were feeding off a ‘ profound sense of anxiety and insecurity ’ created by the financial crisis			0
‘ it is understandable that when politicians who come along in different guises and say to people , all your problems can go away , just blame someone else – blame foreigners , blame immigrants , blame @entity65 – that politics of blame becomes very appealing , ’ he said			0
‘ but however appealing that might be it is n’t an answer to the modern world ... you ca n’t turn the clock back to the 1950s			0
’ @entity73 's @entity5 won two seats in the 2009 @entity36 elections , but has lost support since the deputy prime minister also criticised mr @entity2 for praising @entity79 ’s ‘ brilliant ’ handling of the civil war in @entity81			1
in an interview with @entity83 , published yesterday , the @entity3 leader was asked which world leader he most admired			2
he replied : ‘ as an operator , but not as a human being , i would say @entity79			0
the way he played the whole @entity81 thing			0
not that i approve of him politically			0
how many journalists in jail now ? ’ speaking at a @entity92 press conference , mr @entity41 said : ‘ i think it is utterly grotesque that @entity2 apparently admires someone , @entity79 , who has been the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most brutal dictators on the planet , president @entity99			2

@entity2 says no - one has done more to whittle away at @entity5 's support
@entity3 has won over people ' upset ' at change in their communities , he said
in 2009 @entity5 won two seats in the @entity109
