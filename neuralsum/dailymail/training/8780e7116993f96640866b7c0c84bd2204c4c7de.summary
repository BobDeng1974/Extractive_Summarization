from @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity3 and 99p stores , they seem to be mushrooming			1
@entity1 - the trailblazer - now has 460 stores in the @entity7			1
and where @entity1 leads , it seems others follow			1
each of the variously named discount stores offers its own unique combination of household goods , supermarket fare , beauty products , homeware , and car accessories			1
so , do they all sell the same products ? and just how do they keep their prices so low ? bags of bargains : @entity23 with her shopping from @entity1 the chain was founded in 1990 by @entity26 and his father , @entity27 , in @entity28 - on - @entity29			1
after changing hands numerous times , it 's now the biggest bargain basement chain in @entity34			1
a typical shop contains more than 3,000 different products with a wealth of brand names including @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
of its 4.5 million savvy shoppers , one in five is a middle - class professional			0
@entity1 says it keeps its prices low by trading directly with major brands			1
it either shrinks the size of products or strikes a deal with suppliers to get knock - down prices because of the volume of stock it sells			1
@entity60 or treasure ? huge aisles and clear signs make shopping easy , despite the fact that the @entity1 i visit in upmarket @entity66 really does sell everything from @entity70 children 's books to @entity71			1
it 's bristling with helpful staff - you could almost be in @entity75			1
there are students ogling the hairdye and nail varnishes , pensioners comparing the price of tinned soups and - over in the party section - i 'm stunned to see the vicar 's wife grabbing armloads of treats for her five - year - old 's forthcoming party			1
a steal : @entity23 picked up armloads of vitamins at bargain prices best for : health and beauty			1
@entity1 is @entity7 's largest seller of batteries - no surprise when you think that an average four - pack of @entity101 costs £ 2.35			1
other top sellers include umbrellas ( 2.5 million were sold last year ) , and @entity105 ( 5.5 million bars in 2013 )			0
it 's branching out into chilled food - you can buy a box of ten eggs or a 160g pack of @entity113 salami			1
but it 's in the healthcare section that you 'll find extraordinary bargains			1
i picked up armloads of vitamins at a steal			0
for example , 90 vitamin d tablets cost £ 5.10 at @entity123			1
i bought 60 here for £ 1			1
they are exactly the same strength , with each tablet containing 200 per cent of my @entity127 ( recommended daily amount			0
@entity129 charges £ 6.99 for 60 @entity131 capsules - i bought 30 at the same strength ( 500mg per tablet ) for just £ 1			1
i was also delighted with the spectacles			0
you 'd be hard pushed to find a better selection of standard prescription glasses in an optician , although you 'll pay a lot more			0
the same size bottle of simple shampoo would cost £ 2.33 at @entity142 's			1
other brands available include @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
verdict : i 'd never been in a @entity1 before , but i 'll definitely be back ! 4/5 the family - owned @entity3 was launched in @entity149 , @entity150 , in 2004 after rebranding from ' everything 's a £ 1 '			1
it now has more than 180 stores in the @entity7 , with plans to open a further 200 in the next five years			0
you will find cleaning products , toiletries , groceries , toys and party goods , and big names such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 's			1
@entity166 boss @entity165 buys in bulk at discounted rates from household names , and commissions own - brand products from @entity172			2
cleaning products : poundworld stocks incredibly cheap cleaners , but there was n't much else @entity23 wanted to buy there @entity60 or treasure ? full to bursting with everything from sparkly hair clips and shower curtains to @entity183 and dog chews , this store was also heaving with customers			1
there were lots of pensioners with pull - along trolleys full of cat food , and young mums with piercings			0
i also spotted two yummy mummies loading up their @entity195 shopping bags with stationery and cleaning products			1
best for : cleaning products			1
the same one - litre bottle of @entity202 floor cleaner is £ 1.50 at @entity142 , while the equivalent bottle of @entity204 is £ 1.25 at @entity205			2
@entity207 disinfectant costs £ 1.33 at @entity205 and mr @entity208 cleaners are £ 2 at most supermarkets			2
i counted 14 different shampoo brands including @entity212 , @entity144 , @entity146 , @entity213 and @entity214 ( £ 1.94 at @entity123 ) verdict : my fellow shoppers seemed to disagree , but - cleaning products aside - there was n't much here i 'd want to buy			1
3/5 the @entity7 's second largest chain of bargain basement stores , the first 99p store was opened by shopkeeper @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity223 , in 2001			2
still a family - run business , there are now more than 200 stores			0
the company has a turnover of £ 269 million and attracts more than 1.5 million customers			2
you 'll find a big range of branded products including @entity162 and @entity234			2
but as the @entity235 specialise in snapping up stock from small businesses that have gone bankrupt ( 20 per cent of their stock is bought this way ) or surplus stock bought direct from large manufacturers , you could end up walking away with anything from a pair of slippers to a family - sized bag of @entity248 crisps			0
parallel universe : the 99p store 's interior looks like a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind - bogglingly low @entity60 or treasure ? walking through the doors of the 99p store in @entity258 , @entity259 , i felt i was stepping into a parallel universe			2
the aisles are wide and well signed like in a conventional supermarket but the prices are mind - bogglingly low			0
i spotted several customers in @entity267 jackets - all looking as shocked as me at the bargains			0
best for : stocking up the store cupboard			0
you could n't do your weekly shop here - unless you 're happy to risk scurvy - as everything comes in tins , jars or packets , but it 's a fantastic starting point			2
i snapped up armfuls of posh @entity248 crisps ( normally £ 2.19 at @entity205 )			2
although i suspect they were produced for the summer market - the flavour is @entity283 - i have until february 7 to eat them			0
with my baby niece about to visit , i bought two packs of @entity287 , each containing two meals , for 99p			0
admittedly , they only had a three - day shelf life , but the same packs cost £ 1.50 at @entity292			2
that 's three times as much			2
why pay more ? @entity23 absolutely loved the 99p store admittedly , some of the labels are new to me			1
i 've never heard of @entity299 mayonnaise and it 's so watery you would n't want a large dollop with your prawns , but it was perfectly serviceable in a ham sandwich			2
and at 99p for 750g it 's a bargain			2
i wonder how a 250ml bottle of @entity310 white balsamic vinegar has ended up on the shelf			0
with a best - before - date of 2017 , it 's hardly reaching the end of its life			2
verdict : i absolutely loved this place - why pay more for kitchen essentials ? 4.5/5 eclectic selection : @entity2 is like a cross between a jumble sale and an @entity322 souk the first @entity2 opened in 1981			1
now there are more than 400 branches and the company is the @entity7 's leading discount retailer of products for the home			1
you wo n't find many big names but you will find everything from baked beans to conditioner and cushions to bird tables			0
if you come here expecting everything for a pound though , you 'll be disappointed			0
while there is plenty of stock on offer for under a quid , there 's also a variety of bigger ticket items with incredible discounts - and free delivery on anything over £ 10			1
much of the homeware is specially made for @entity2 in @entity349 , and other items are surplus stock from big - name companies			1
@entity60 or treasure ? a cross between a jumble sale and an @entity322 souk , the shelves heave with a mish - mash of special buys and dreg ends			0
i found lamp shades in the bathroom section , stationery among the bedding , and shower gel where the dog food should be			0
my fellow shoppers seemed unfazed , though			0
best for : half - price homeware			0
a diamante embellished toilet brush for £ 6.99 may not be your thing , but how about bathroom scales for £ 3.99 or a double duvet with matching pillows for £ 9.99 ? admittedly there are few brands , though a lot of the stock is from @entity382 company @entity381			2
but there 's a good selection			0
the store i visited in @entity387 had a selection of 14 different pillows starting at just £ 1.99			0
that 's almost as many as you 'd find in @entity75			0
i snapped up a @entity393 pillow for just £ 6.99			0
with an @entity394 of £ 15.99 , the cheapest i could find it elsewhere is £ 12.97 on @entity396			0
the pillow is a genuine @entity393 - complete with famous @entity398 logo			0
the catch ? the label is misspelt : ' @entity401 ' instead of ' @entity402 ' , something most major retailers would be reluctant to accept			0
an expensive mistake for someone - but a bargain for me			0
verdict : i 'm thrilled with my bargain pillow , but would n't give house - room to much else			0

@entity1 is best for health and beauty , @entity3 for cleaning products
not everything is £ 1 , but @entity2 has cheap bigger ticket items
