officers warned @entity2 that if they arrive looking for jobs on the black market they are likely to be exploited or become victims of crime			1
but there is also evidence that many of those who come to @entity6 end up committing petty crimes such as begging and pickpocketing – sometimes recruited by organised gangs who ‘ employ ’ them to shoplift , steal and rob			2
the police operation came after a raid on the derelict ground of @entity37 in @entity17			1
officers discovered that almost every rough sleeper in the squat was from the same remote part of @entity2			2
one man told @entity44 ’s @entity43 that up to 400 people had left his village in the @entity48 mountains for @entity17			1
he said they were prepared to live in grim camps for the chance of illicit building work where they could earn up to three times their usual wages			0
chief superintendent @entity55 told the programme the message to @entity2 was that they should not travel to @entity6 unless they can support themselves			2
‘ what i ’m saying is that we know that if you come to the @entity6 without a named job to go to , then you ’re at really increased risk of being exploited or being the victim or perpetrator of crime , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re here to protect all the residents of @entity17 and that includes those people who come to @entity17 looking for work			0
’ in an unprecedented mission , officers warned civilians of rural @entity2 towns to be careful about migrating increasing : the number of @entity2 immigrants , some pictured here in @entity17 's @entity78 , is rising last week the @entity79 revealed that @entity2 are arrested at seven times the rate of @entity6 in @entity17			1
and @entity2 immigrants account for more than 11 per cent of all foreign national offenders – despite making up only a tiny proportion of @entity6 residents			1
this placed the eastern @entity87 nation at the top of a ‘ league table ’ of foreign suspects , followed by those from @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
the troubling figures were uncovered by police analysts just weeks before restrictions on @entity2 and @entity99 living in @entity6 are lifted on january 1			1
changes : immigration minister @entity101 insists new rules will prevent people coming to sleep rough they also discovered that eastern @entity87 offenders are more likely to be involved in low - level offences			1
last year , @entity2 accounted for nearly half of all arrests for begging in the capital and 34 per cent of pickpocketing arrests			2
many live in makeshift camps across @entity17 , including @entity78 and @entity3 , where efforts to move them have failed repeatedly			0
the @entity114 has already brought a team of police from @entity2 and @entity92 to @entity17 to tackle crimes committed by their fellow nationals			1
there are concerns that gaps in cross-border intelligence checks are allowing prolific and dangerous offenders to slip through the net			0
around 70,000 foreign nationals are arrested in @entity17 every year – about 28 per cent of all criminal suspects taken into custody			0
immigration minister @entity101 said changes to legislation will allow border officials to stop people coming to @entity6 to sleep rough or beg			1

we have a zero tolerance on any type of crime			0

@entity147 , leader of @entity149 council , said : ' the reality is nobody knows how many @entity2 and @entity99 are coming and that is deeply unsettling for councils			1
' people who come here to work are welcome but january the first should n't be the starter 's pistol for local authorities to be deluged with people they ca n't cope with			0
' we are already seeing the effects of some criminality linked to @entity163 seeping out to the suburbs - and that ranges from prostitution to pick pocketing and beds in sheds overcrowding			0
