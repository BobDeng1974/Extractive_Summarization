@entity26 leader @entity25 enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside @entity31 and @entity32			0
spotlight : @entity14 has joined the @entity9 in blocking @entity4 leader @entity11 from the leader 's debates held in the build up to the @entity37 until recently @entity14 had hoped to capitalise on the rise of @entity4 , hoping it would split the centre - right vote and allow them to clinch crucial swing seats			1

' without him there will be no debates , then we 'll worry about keeping @entity11 out			0

’ the main three political parties have all seen the threat posed by @entity4 increase over the past few years			2
conventional election wisdom among @entity14 had been that @entity4 would only significantly harm the @entity9			1

in a further embarrassment for @entity14 , party officials were forced to ‘ clarify ’ remarks by mr @entity3 in which he appeared to suggest he would look to cut universal benefits for wealthy pensioners			1
he revealed during the interview that the @entity156 ‘ needs to be looked at ’ , suggesting he would oppose @entity58 promises to protect benefits for all pensioners			0
but minutes later senior sources insisted the party position that it would protect the handouts had not changed			0
the @entity9 seized on the interview as proof @entity14 ’s economic policy was in a ‘ mess ’			2
