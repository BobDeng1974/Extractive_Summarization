health bosses in north wales are urging patients to buy simple painkillers , laxatives and hayfever treatments rather than relying on free prescriptions patients in the @entity8 are being told not to use their free prescriptions – because of @entity11 's ' funding cuts '			1
hundreds of thousands of people who live in @entity1 were yesterday urged not to ask their gp to prescribe a range of medicines for minor complaints , such as painkillers , laxatives and hay fever treatments			2
instead , patients are encouraged to ' self - care ' and ' purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments '			1
the restrictions are being imposed because of the ' economic climate ' and to ' cope with the funding cuts ' , the largest health board in the principality said yesterday			1
@entity11 , which runs the @entity31 in @entity32 as a result of devolution , has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010			2
but in @entity37 , where the @entity8 is under the control of the @entity39 , spending has risen slightly in real terms since the election			0
the @entity42 has focused on some of the adverse effects of the cuts including longer waits for ambulances , far more people waiting more than four hours in @entity48 than in @entity37 , and poor cancer care – with some @entity8 patients being forced to move to @entity37 to get cancer drugs			1
in january the strain on the @entity8 was highlighted when the furious wife of a paramedic posted online a photograph of at least ten ambulances – together with three rapid response cars – waiting outside @entity58 in @entity59 to unload patients at its overwhelmed @entity48 department			2
last night the leader of the @entity63 , @entity62 , said : ' @entity11 's savage cuts to the @entity8 have come at a time when spending has been protected in other parts of the @entity68 , with obvious consequences			0
' not only have we recently witnessed the worst ambulance response times since records began , more patients than ever are waiting over 12 hours in @entity48 , and @entity8 cancer patients continue to be denied access to life - saving drugs which are available in @entity37 under the @entity39 's @entity77			2
' prescriptions are free to all in @entity32 , @entity79 and @entity80 , but in @entity37 a charge of £ 8.20 is applied unless the patient is exempt			2
how the @entity42 exposed the crisis : ten ambulances queue to unload patients at an @entity48 in @entity59 pensioners and children are among those who do not pay for their prescriptions in @entity37			0
yesterday @entity88 , which covers much of north wales , urged people no longer to ask their gp to be prescribed medicines they could buy over the counter at their local pharmacy			0
@entity95 has asked gps to reduce ' unnecessary prescribing of simple medications ' , including painkillers , laxatives , vitamins , hayfever and head lice treatments			1
they say patients can purchase these drugs at a ' minimum cost ' , often more cheaply than it would cost the @entity8 to supply the drugs			1
the board said in a statement that , with the ' current economic climate putting a sharp focus on public spending ' , the local @entity8 needed to take ' tough decisions ' to help address ' gaps in funding '			0
dr @entity117 , clinical director of pharmacy and medicines management , said : ' many of these [ over-the - counter ] products can be purchased at a minimum cost and often much more cheaply than it would cost the @entity8			1
' we spend £ 4million every year on over-the - counter medicines and this year we are experiencing a significant growth in their cost			0
a 2 per cent reduction would reduce our costs by an estimated £ 80,000 , which at a time when the @entity8 is under constant pressure is a significant amount			0
' we can make savings through encouraging patients to ' self - care ' and to purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments			2
' he added that community pharmacists are highly trained and are in ' an ideal position to assist with ' self care ' , and offer advice on the most appropriate product for patients			0
they say patients can purchase these drugs at a ' minimum cost ' , often more cheaply than it would cost the @entity8 to supply the drugs			1
the board said it spends four million pounds a year on over the counter drugs dr @entity117 added that the board have asked gps in the area to reduce unnecessary prescribing of these simple medications			1
' however , be reassured that if your gp considers it essential that you take the medication for your condition , it will be prescribed to you , ' he said			0
' this will not only free up your gp 's time , but will also reduce waste through the prescribing of additional quantities for use on a future basis or ' just in case '			0
conservative shadow health minister @entity174 seized on dr @entity117 's comments , telling the @entity176 they are ' recognition that @entity11 's universal free prescriptions policy is unaffordable and wastes vital funds which could be spent improving patient care '			1
@entity181 , chief officer for the @entity182 said : ' our members welcome this drive by health boards , both locally and nationally , and see it as a positive way forward in reducing the huge amount of waste that comes from repeat prescriptions and stockpiling of medications by patients			0
' however , it is also reassuring that in some situations the doctor can still prescribe these medicines on the @entity8			0
' ÷ doctors from the @entity198 of the @entity199 have passed a vote of no confidence in the same @entity8 health board over its plans to downgrade the maternity unit at @entity205 in @entity206 for 12 months .			1

as of 2007 free prescriptions are offered in @entity32 as part of treatment
but health bosses say patients can buy drugs at a ' minimum cost ' , often more cheaply than it would cost the @entity8 to supply the medication
