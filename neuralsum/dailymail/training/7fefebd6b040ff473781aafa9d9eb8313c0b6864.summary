jitters spread throughout the country after the discovery of a single male @entity12 fruit fly , described as the world 's worst fruit pest such is the concern about the discovery of the tiny fly , which is about twice the size of a match head , that primary industries minister @entity31 ordered the country 's trading partners , which include @entity34 , about the alarm			1
fruit flies are feared by all fruit - producing nations because they puncture the skin to lay their eggs			2
the fruit surrounding the egg begins to rot and then , when the eggs hatch , the maggots start gnawing through the rest of the fruit causing it to fall , wasted , to the ground			0
the single fly found in the @entity17 suburb has terrified the government , which regards it as a sign that others might be prevalent , threatening the Â£ 2 billion fruit and vegetable export industry			1
as the biochemistry experts searched the suburb for other flies , mr @entity31 said this was a potentially serious biosecurity issue and it was important to start notifying the country 's trading partners			2
' we need to quickly find out whether this trapping involves a single insect or whether a breeding population has been established - in which case an eradication response will be commenced immediately , ' he said			0
mr @entity70 , chief executive of @entity71 , said the industry , which is in the middle of its export season , was waiting with ' bated breath ' for further developments			0

it is the first time a fruit fly has been discovered in @entity2 since the discovery of a @entity97 fruit by in 1996			2
it is believed the @entity12 fruit fly has arrived through fresh fruit - but there are fears that others have come with it			0
mr @entity31 said that ' while it is a serious potential issue , i do n't we we should over-react if we are dealing with a single trapping			0

flies ' sting ' fruit then larva eat it from inside
