comedian @entity6 ( pictured ) has investigated modern men 's obsession with the perfect physique in a new documentary			1
he discovered that an omnipresent media , peer pressure and that wider use of pornography is to blame indeed , more and more young men are embarking on extreme diets , punishing exercise regimes and undergoing cosmetic surgery			1
a major factor that is thought to be contributing to men 's poor body image is the wide use of pornography			1
the rise of the ' metrosexual man ' has seen a whole new industry of men 's magazine and products develop @entity6 's friend agrees , saying that pornography ' distorts people 's reality ' and that ' even though it is n't real , it does give you insecurities '			1
@entity6 then meets well - known , muscly porn actor @entity53 , who explains that the porn industry 's audience and demands have changed over the past decade			1
' before i started working , there were no really handsome or fit guys doing what i do , ' he said			0
' but since i started working there 's been more pressure to look good			2
it ' not just about women			0
' [ also ] it 's not just men that watch us now - women and couples watch it together too - so men feel more insecure			1
' pornography producer @entity72 agrees : ' as an industry , we have a massive influence over how men feel about their bodies			1
' @entity79 is now watched by so many people that , along with other media , we are changing how people feel about themselves			2
' this could be said to be reflected in the increasing number of men going under the knife			1
' when i first started doing surgery around 10 to 15 per cent of my clientele were men , ' @entity89 - based cosmetic surgeon dr @entity88 told @entity6			1
' but over the past six or seven years , it has grown to 60 per cent			0
' indeed dr @entity88 has himself undergone surgery to give himself a ripped torso			0
physically ' perfect ' celebrities such as @entity99 were also blamed for rise in insecure males in the documentary , called ' @entity6 : my perfect body ' , the comedian also interviews his younger brother @entity106 , 16 , who , along with friends has started to pump iron at his local gym			1
when asked why they have decided to get a gym membership , they say that they want to ' look good , be healthy and get girls '			0
they have even altered their diet to increase their protein intake and maximise their muscles			0
they discuss the fact that their generation was born into a world where an obsession with posting ' selfies ' on @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 are the norm			0
the teenage friends say that most of their friends doctor their photographs using software such as @entity136 before they post them online because it is ' so important ' to make sure a person look good in today 's society			0
according to recent research , a growing minority of men dislike their body , with one in three admitting they would give a year of their life up to improve their appearance			2
teenagers in the documentary said their friends ' doctored ' photos to look perfect before they posted them on @entity129 another study found that 80 per cent of men are unhappy with the way they look and 70 per cent are even ashamed of their body			1
two in five men are also thought to be on a diet at any one time			0
even more alarming statistics suggest that up to 70 per cent of teenage boys are unhappy with their body			0
and since 2000 , the number of male anorexics have shot up by 27 per cent - twice as fast as the growth rate in females			0
the documentary also finds that the popularity of advertising that employs perfectly honed male celebrities such as @entity99 , is also contributing to the male obsession with appearance			2
indeed for the first time ever , men 's health magazine 's have overtaken men 's lifestyle publications			0
there is also a burgeoning industry in men 's fitness dvds			2
one man in the programme said ' if you 're fat , you 're seen as lazy or a loser			0
being fat is a sign of being unsuccessful			0
' finally , the fact that men , unlike women , can be very vocal about their friend 's insecurities compounds the problem			0
one woman in the documentary said : ' a woman would n't dream of pointing out a girlfriend 's imperfections but men see a mate 's belly as excuse to tease			2
