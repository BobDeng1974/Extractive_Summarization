by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 5 august 2013 hospitals that allow private company reps to bombard new mothers with marketing materials while on maternity wards could face action from the health watchdog under new proposals by @entity9			1
companies such as @entity11 - the @entity12 's biggest parenting club - pay the @entity13 to allow their reps on to maternity wards to speak to new mothers			1
following a series of surveys and campaigns by @entity21 , which found eight out of ten mothers felt the practise was unacceptable , mp @entity17 is bringing an @entity24 on the issue before the @entity26			2
health minister @entity27 , who is also a hospital doctor , has now vowed to take action and insisted the @entity29 has stronger powers to act when a patient 's dignity is compromised			0
stricter rules : the @entity29 will be able to take action against hospitals if a new mother 's dignity is compromised by private company reps approaching them within hours of giving birth he told the @entity41 on sunday : ' @entity11 representatives engage with women appropriately during pregnancy and before birth			1
however , i wrote to hospitals about a month ago to highlight the outrageous behaviour of some @entity49 in showing an unacceptable disregard for the privacy and dignity of women and families at what can be a very vulnerable time			0
' we have recently been strengthening the role and powers of the @entity29 to intervene where there is poor care or where patients ' dignity is compromised during their care			0
so if hospitals do not take action to get a grip on the situation , then the @entity29 will be able to take action against the birthing unit			0
' @entity11 is paid around £ 90,000 a year to distribute benefit forms at hospitals as it is cheaper than posting them out individually			2
but the company has been accused in research by @entity21 of telling new mothers they must sign up to its own parenting club to receive the benefits - which is n't true			1
@entity11 refuted the claims - insisting it has a strong code of conduct for its staff			1
other complaints have included private companies pressurising mothers to buy professional photographs or to reveal personal information which is then sold on to third parties			2
a petition on change.org calling for an end to reps in maternity units has 21,000 signatures so far			2
it says : ' the hours after having a baby are an important time for mums and their partners to get to know their new baby , learn the skill of feeding and baby care and for the mum to recover from the physical effects of birth			2
this is a time for rest and recuperation and for the new family and their relatives and friends			0
' @entity115 from sales representatives there to pass on advertising material and extract data from mothers to sell on , is not something a new family needs			0
yet in maternity units across the country this is what is happening , often within the first few hours of a baby being born			0
on board : health minister dr @entity27 has promised to take against to stop the practise ' profit motivated parenting clubs such as @entity11 are paying maternity units for the right to access their wards and approach mothers just hours after they have given birth			1
they are also allowed to take photographs of new parents with their babies that they then sell to parents			0
they generate a large profit both from the photographs and by selling the data they obtain from parents on to companies , who then shower parents with advertising and sales calls			0
' a survey by @entity21 shows over half of new mothers felt the @entity11 rep invaded their privacy on maternity wards			1
maternity units are not the place for strangers selling their products			0
the government must stop allowing sales reps onto maternity wards			1
' the survey by @entity21 also found that more than half - 56 per cent - of new mothers felt a @entity11 rep invaded their privacy while 60 per cent were not specifically told their personal details would be passed on to other companies			1
in cases where mothers reported feeling hassled by over-zealous @entity11 salespeople , 17 per cent said @entity175 reps implied parents would only be able to claim @entity177 if they filled in @entity175 's commercial forms			1
@entity179 , ceo of @entity21 , said : ' we 're very pleased that the government is listening to @entity21 users ' concerns which have led to the @entity185 campaign			0
' we look forward to working with the @entity29 to ensure that new mothers are protected from hard - sell tactics on maternity wards			1
' some hospital trusts have already taken swift action to address the situation , and we will continue to put pressure on other hospital trusts to review their policies			0
' but @entity194 , an independent research company , has raised questions over the research			0
they studied the survey and were concerned by the methods used by @entity21 to gain participants ( for instance , a tweet with a link to the survey that read ' hassled by @entity11 ? tell us your experience '			1
as a result , they have said : ' the greatest concern regarding the validity of the research is the sample selection			0
the survey is not representative of @entity12 mothers and therefore does not stand up to scrutiny			1
eight of ten mothers said reps being allowed on to maternity wards was unacceptable , a survey by @entity21 found ' of concern as well is the fact that both the framing of the survey on the @entity21 website , and some of the questions themselves , are leading			1
these lead the respondents to a negative perception of @entity11 representatives			2
overall , the results of the survey can be questioned and not be considered representative of mothers ’ opinions			0
' @entity237 , general manager of @entity11 , added : ' we enforce a rigorous @entity239 , which respects mums ’ privacy as well as use of any data collected			2
' @entity11 ladies , many of whom are mums themselves , never enter a ward without being cleared to do so by medical staff			1
' we take any violation of the code of conduct seriously and regularly review it as part of our collaboration with the @entity13			1
' for over 50 years , we have worked in partnership with @entity13 hospitals and trusts to ensure that mums and hospital staff are happy with the service we provide , as we strive to achieve 100 per cent satisfaction amongst mums			2
' the @entity262 have also confirmed recently that they continue to value their relationship with @entity11			2
' we are proud to say that @entity11 is welcomed by 99 per cent of maternity units , and an independent survey by @entity266 shows that 93 per cent of all midwives and heads of midwifery approve of the service provided by @entity11 staff			1
' we are also proud of the fact that 92 per cent of mums say that they love bounty packs , as it gives them free products and money off coupons - as well as access to essential health information			0
@entity281 ' this is important to all mums , and particularly to those from lower socio - demographic groups who might not have access to this from other sources			0
' our work to deliver child benefit forms to mums is hugely successful and helps 82 per cent of mums , of all backgrounds , to claim this important financial assistance			0

companies such as @entity11 - the @entity12 's biggest parenting club - pay the @entity13 to allow their reps on to maternity wards to speak to first - time mothers
but patients claim they have been hassled by reps *shortly* after giving birth
@entity11 refuted the claims - stating they have a strict code of conduct for their staff
