would the average @entity1 woman buy a kimono ? would its 50 - something customer ever , voluntarily , try on a crop top ? these two things are what @entity1 ’s new style supremo @entity7 is banking on			1
and she launched her vision for the women of @entity11 yesterday in grand style , with the unveiling of her collection for spring / summer 2014			1
floodlights illuminated a honey - stoned former church in @entity18 ’s @entity17 , while handpicked members of the fashion press were served elegant trays of canapes and prosecco on tap			1
there was even a goodie bag containing an @entity28 vase			1
would the average @entity1 woman buy a kimono ? would its 50 - something customer ever , voluntarily , try on a crop top ? @entity32 gives her brutally honest opinion on @entity1 's new drop you ca n’t say @entity36 ’s not trying			1
and while you ’d think she ’d be pouring sweat given that womenswear sales dropped , again , in the three months until september , she oozed calm			1
‘ i ’m not losing sleep , ’ she told me			1
‘ yes , i ’ve been surprised at the attention on me since i joined @entity1 , but it ’s a public company			1
everyone has an opinion about us			1
’ she was keen , though , to distance herself from the humourless , much derided leading ladies autumn ad campaign , featuring @entity48 , @entity50 et al , stressing that she has no input into the marketing of her critically , if not commercially , well - received clothes			2
so , is the @entity1 ceo @entity54 insisting @entity36 work five days a week , not her usual three ? ‘ no , definitely not			2
but my smartphone is always vibrating			2
’ is she at least beginning to achieve what she set out to do , having been in the hot seat for more than a year ? ( she joined @entity1 , after heading up @entity58 and @entity59 , in september 2012			2
) designer : i think this ensemble is very @entity63 - and you can do up the coat to make it look less ' fashion ' if you like ( @entity66 trench , £ 79 , white collarless shirt , £ 22.50 , black skirt , £ 29 , and black sandals with block heels , £ 29.50 ) flattering : this tuxedo waistcoat is slimming and could be worn over anything - but i worry the top is too revealing ( @entity77 tuxedo waistcoat , £ 59 , top £ 35 , trousers £ 39.50 , shoes £ 49.50 and leather tote £ 79 ) limited edition : this best of @entity82 collection is pricey and only a few hundred of each piece will be produced ( soft wool cocoon coat £ 249 , top , £ 69 , and skirt , £ 79 ) soft leathers : these buttery soft leather pieces will be instant sell - outs , but they will snapped up only by the fashion pack ( £ 249 , leather pencil skirt , £ 149 , collarless shirt £ 39.50 , and red shoes £ 99 ) ‘ absolutely , ’ she said			1
‘ as promised , we are rolling out a more spacious shop floor design across the country , training staff to be more confident about offering styling advice and we have a welcome zone in each store , with mannequins displaying key trends			2
’ i wonder if she is n’t galled that even in the weeks after the collapse of the garment factory in @entity110 , other stores saw sales soar , while @entity1 , which has a policy of never using factories more than two storeys high , has seen them plummet ? ‘ it ’s frustrating , but we ’re not going to abandon our ethical stance : that is what customers expect from us , ’ said @entity36			1
surely , though , she has made some mistakes , such as offering too many lines and , more importantly , introducing sky - high prices ( a @entity82 wool pea coat for winter is £ 349 , while a small pink leather satchel is £ 299 ! )			1
@entity32 's favourite : this is the best dress i 've seen in years : short sleeves , ruching to cover the tummy and a gorgeous mesh overlay fabric ( @entity134 lace mesh overlay dress , £ 45 , clutch , £ 25 , and shoes £ 19.50 ) think pink : i like a soft leather t - shirt and these cotton cigarette are are cut well but the colour 's rather garish ( @entity141 top , £ 169 , trousers , £ 59 , and shoes £ 29.50 ) but yesterday @entity36 refused to admit she might not be on the right path : ‘ women want real choice , newness			1
and that pea coat sold extremely well , by the way			2
’ ah , but what about @entity54 ’s comment last week in response to certain must - haves , such as the notorious powder blue coat , selling out , saying key pieces were ‘ carefully managed ’ so as not to become ubiquitous ? @entity36 then lapsed into marketing speak : ‘ it ’s all about potentialising it			2
it ’s not our purpose to restrict [ a garment ] , but about creating a tension , a balance			2
’ my big worry is that @entity1 ’s new collection is all too high fashion			1
i mean short , swishy skater skirts			2
@entity1 , you can not be serious ! she pooh - poohed , too , claims that @entity1 ’s regional stores are still the poor relation to those in the big cities			0
‘ you can buy every piece online and have it delivered to your home or your nearest store			0
there is no problem , ’ she said			0
and herein lies the rub			0
while the spring collection is gorgeous , with so many pieces reminding me of designers such as @entity190 , @entity191 , hell , even @entity63 , i wonder that the core customer might feel sidelined — women who do n’t own a computer , much less shop online			0
much i saw yesterday will undoubtedly garner glowing plaudits in the fashion press : a cutaway @entity63 - style black trench , cream tuxedo waistcoat , pink leather biker with chunky ribbed sleeves , pencil skirts in sky blue or lemon ( guaranteed to sell out in days , despite the £ 149 price tag ) , cream waffle skirt , chunky knits , sweatshirts , a lemon dress in mesh with ruching at the tummy			1
and the shoes have improved ten-fold : silver , pointy stilettos , black sandals with block @entity228 ’s @entity221 range , which is rather preppy , features gorgeous cropped black trousers , a tweedy summer coat ( £ 249 ) you could wear to the smartest of weddings and silk shirts			1
this outfit belongs in @entity231 : the skater skirt comes straight from the @entity233 while the peach jacket it too boxy			0
( @entity134 jacket , £ 79 , top , £ 22.50 , and skirt £ 39.50			0
the leather bag , £ 99 , and two - tone pumps £ 25 , will be wardrobe staples for years ) no - go : oh dear , @entity241 might look lovely in this kimono jacket and wide culottes , but those of us who are more branch - like will feel very wide indeed ( @entity241 for @entity134 kimono jacket £ 69 , @entity141 culottes , £ 45 and shoes , £ 29.50 ) @entity250 is in the details : silk linings , extra-long zips , classy gold metallic labels			0
but , but , but ! my big worry is that @entity1 ’s new collection is all too high fashion			1
i mean short , swishy skater skirts			0
@entity1 , you can not be serious ! crop tops that will show off your tummy and cropped trousers that suit only those with the legs of a flamingo			0
trendy sandals , with a wide ankle strap , that only shorten the leg			0
while its silk kimono blouse is lovely and could be worn by a woman of any age , the kimono wrap jacket is too bulky			0
yes , there is a gorgeous metallic , spaghetti - strapped slip dress on sale , but only those with @entity282 ’s body could possibly pull it off			0
the new white voluminous skirts with sheer stripes feel very @entity286 — which is exactly where they belong			0
of course , it all appeals to skinny fashionistas like me , but we are not the core customer			0
i doubt , too , there are enough of us to keep @entity1 shareholders happy			0
so if this spring / summer collection , which hits stores in january , does n’t lift sales of clothing , will @entity7 be out on her ear ? she laughed when i said this			0
‘ no. i ’m very confident			0
’ but the thing is that fashion moves so swiftly and the @entity1 customer ’s patience is notoriously so thin that time may be running out			1
if i were in @entity7 ’s shoes , i ’d be working seven days a week and putting my phone on loud …			0
