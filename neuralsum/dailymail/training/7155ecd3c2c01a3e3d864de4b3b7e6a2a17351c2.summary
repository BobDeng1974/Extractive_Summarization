by @entity0 the number of deaths on the roads has risen alarmingly this year – with experts warning that the use of smartphones could be to blame			2
there were 380 road deaths in the first three months of 2014 – 13 per cent more than in the january to march period last year			1
but when the number killed is added the number seriously injured – to create the official @entity13 casualty measure – there were 5,500 incidents in the first quarter of this year , a rise of 17 per cent			2
new figures reveal there were 380 road deaths in the first quarter of 2014 ( file picture , posed by model ) the casualty figures are higher among so - called ‘ vulnerable ’ road users on two wheels or on foot			1
motoring groups said there were ‘ questions to be answered ’			0
experts were last night asking whether issues such as mobile phone use and texting by drivers and pedestrians failing to look where they are going were contributory factors			1
they also said there were signs of increasing conflicts between cyclists and motorists sharing congested road space			0
the latest official estimates for january to march 2014 show that the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 16 per cent to 1,460			0
cyclist fatalities and serious injuries increased 27 per cent to 690 , while the number of motorcyclists killed or seriously injured rose by 20 per cent to 950			0

the number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 9 per cent to 350			0
@entity13 experts said the big rise could partly be explained by the severe weather at the start of 2013 which kept many vehicles , and pedestrians , off the roads			2
motoring groups also said there were signs of increasing conflicts between cyclists and motorists sharing congested road space ( file picture ) march 2013 was the coldest march for 50 years which was reflected in the ‘ comparatively low ’ road casualty figures – including 336 deaths for the first three months of last year			1
they argued that a more meaningful comparison is the fatality figure for the first three months of 2012 which , at 414 , is higher than the estimated figure for the same period this year			0
also , the fatality figure for the first three months of 2011 was as high as 445			0
@entity87 technical director @entity86 said the weather had an impact , but added : ‘ mobile phone use has been a problem for some time and there ’s not been enough action to tackle it			1
using a hand - held phone or texting while driving must be made socially unacceptable			1
’ the @entity97 ’s @entity96 said this year ’s figures were ‘ very disappointing ’ , adding : ‘ we hope this is no more than a temporary blip to the long - term progress the @entity22 is making in reducing road deaths and injuries			1
’ transport minister @entity105 said the number of deaths last year was the lowest since records began in 1926 , but added : ‘ however , one road death is one too many , which is why we continue to work to tackle dangerous driving and make our roads safer for everyone			2
