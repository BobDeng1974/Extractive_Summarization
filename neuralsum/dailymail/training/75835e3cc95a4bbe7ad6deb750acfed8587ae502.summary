a new study has concluded e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative to smoking tobacco e-cigarettes generate toxic chemicals similar to those found in tobacco and may harm the lungs and immune system , scientists claimed today			1
a new study , thought to be the first where animals were exposed to ' vaping ' , found it is far from being a safe alternative to smoking tobacco			1
in the experiments , mice exposed to e-cigarette fumes suffered mild damage to their lungs and became far more susceptible to respiratory infections			1
their immune responses to both viruses and bacteria were weakened by such an extent that some animals died			1
scientists also found that e-cigarette vapour contained ' free radical ' toxins similar to those found in cigarette smoke and air pollution			0
free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can damage dna and cell membranes			2
professor @entity39 , from @entity40 in the @entity41 , who led the research published in the online journal @entity44 , said : ' our findings suggest that e-cigarettes are not neutral in terms of the effects on the lungs			0
' we have observed that they increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections in the mouse models			2
' this warrants further study in susceptible individuals , such as @entity58 ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ) patients who have switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes , or to new users of e-cigarettes who may have never used cigarettes			0
' for two weeks , mice were exposed to e-cigarette vapour in amounts equivalent to the doses inhaled by humans			0
the animals were then infected with pneumonia bacteria or a strain of flu virus			0
compared with other mice not exposed to the fumes , they were much more likely to develop a weakened immune response			1
co-author dr @entity79 , also from @entity40 , said : ' e-cigarette vapour alone produced mild effects on the lungs , including inflammation and protein damage			2
' however , when this exposure was followed by a bacterial or viral infection , the harmful effects of e-cigarette exposure became even more pronounced			0
' the e-cigarette exposure inhibited the ability of mice to clear the bacteria from their lungs , and the viral infection led to increased weight loss and death , indicative of an impaired immune response			2
' the research , thought to be the first where animals were exposed to ' vaping ' , found e-cigarette fumes cause mild damage to the lungs and could make people more susceptible to respiratory infections ( file picture ) the study is thought to be the first to investigate an animal 's response to e-cigarette inhalation			1
e-cigarettes generated just one per cent of the amount of free radicals in tobacco smoke , but this still posed a potential health risk , said the researchers			1
' we were surprised by how high that number was , considering that e-cigarettes do not produce combustion products , ' said dr @entity121			0
' granted , it 's 100 times lower than cigarette smoke , but it 's still a high number of free radicals that can potentially damage cells			1
' e-cigarette sales in the @entity41 are expected to overtake sales of cigarettes in the next 10 years			0
in 2013 , more than 250,000 @entity41 teenagers who had never smoked a cigarette reported using e-cigarettes .			0

new study at @entity40 found ' vaping ' is not a safe alternative to smoking tobacco
in experiments , mice exposed to fumes suffered mild damage to lungs
they also became more susceptible to respiratory infections
scientists found their immune responses to bacterial and viral infections were weakened to such an extent that some mice died
study thought to be the first to examine an animal 's response to ' vaping '
devices generated just 1 *%* of the free radicals found in cigarettes but still posed a potential health risk , scientists warned
