a skull that 's more than three and a half millennia old has revealed signs of an early form of brain surgery			1
the perforated skull belongs to a mummified woman found in the @entity7 tomb in @entity9 's @entity8			1
experts said that the hole , which measures around 2 inches ( 50mm ) in diameter , was most likely an early form of craniotomy			2
the perforated skull ( pictured ) was discovered as part of a mummified body of a woman in the ' @entity19 ' xiaohe tomb complex			1
experts said that the hole , measuring around 2 inches ( 50mm ) in diameter , was most likely an early form of craniotomy - a procedure that involves removing bone to get access to the brain a craniotomy involves temporarily removing a ' flap ' of bone from the skull to give surgeons access to the brain			1
the amount of skull removed depends on the type of surgery being performed , and the flap is later replaced using screws			1
it may have also been a form of trepanation , which involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull			1
this procedure has been performed since prehistoric times , and cave paintings indicate that ancient people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures , headaches and mental disorders			0
the wound suggests that the female ( pictured ) , who died in her 40s , must have lived for at least a month , or even longer , after receiving the surgery lead archaeologist @entity56 who made the discovery said : ' [ the wound ] suggests the female , who died in her 40s , must have lived for at least a month , or even longer , after receiving the surgery			1
' he added there were also signs of healing tissues around the wound			2
the mummy dates back to 1,615 @entity66 and is one of hundreds discovered in the @entity7 ' @entity69			1
lying 108 miles ( 175 km ) west of the ancient city of @entity72 , the site was first explored in 1934 by @entity74 archaeologist @entity73 , but not fully excavated until 2005			0
dating of the area has shown it goes back to approximately 2,000 @entity66 , although tests have revealed the bodies contain dna from the east and west			0
in particular , males were found to have chromosomes typically found in @entity84 and @entity85 , alongside dna found in @entity86			2
the massive burial site has more than 330 graves and contains the largest number of mummies ever found in the world			0
these tombs include adults and children as well as 15 intact mummies , although approximately half of the tombs were said to have been looted by grave robbers			0
the majority of the coffins found on the site were made of wood , and were shaped like boats , buried upside down			0

the oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in @entity132 dating back to 6500 bc. but it was also used by the @entity134 , @entity9 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and the early @entity139 civilizations			1
even the ' father of medicine ' hippocrates advocated the process in his 400 @entity66 tome ' on @entity145 '			0
modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain , increasing lucidity and heightening brain function			0
this practice is similar to how the @entity153 believed boats would take @entity155 to the land of the ‘ gods ’ clothes and jewellery found in the tomb were also buried alongside the mummies , in small baskets , and the bodies were wrapped in cowhide and wool			2
this prevented sand from getting inside the corpses			0
in addition to the wood coffins , four clay - covered rectangular coffins were also found , surrounded by stakes			2
and six of the coffins were found to contain wooden ' bodies ' , rather than corpses			0
each of these wooden sculptures were the same shape and were designed to look like males			0
sexual iconography was everywhere at the site , with posts representing phalluses and vulvas placed in front of each grave			0
last week , scientists recreated ancient brain surgery to understand medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago			2
a team of experts in @entity193 spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors carried out their work			2

analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool , a bronze knife , with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull , yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work .			1
