by @entity0 published : 04:29 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 30 april 2013 with its wings skimming across the water , this super yacht soars above the competition			1
its state - of - the - art design means the world 's fastest yacht can clock an amazing 60 miles an hour - and reach 50mph in just ten seconds			1
the @entity9 , which uses marine and aeronautic technology , relies on giant wings to almost fly across the water			1
pictured in these gorgeous photos taken off of the @entity14 coast the yacht , which weighs 7.5 tons , it 's easy to see why the powerful boat has broken so many world records			1
in in full flight only 2.5 square metres of the boat are in contact with the water the boat 's overall length is 22.78m ( 74.7 ft ) - compared to the average @entity42 flat , which is 7.8m ( 25.7 ft )			1
the length of the floats is 6.7m ( 22 ft )			0
it spans 24m ( 79 ft ) and the height of the mast measures 28 meters ( 92 ft )			0
the @entity49 weighs 7.5 tons and the bindings that maintain the crossbeam can withstand 48 tons of strain			0
the crew has just 10 m² living space in the central hull			0
maximum sail area in flight is 560 m² - much bigger than new @entity42 one bedroom flats , which measure on average 76m			2
in 2005 it sailed across the @entity62 faster than @entity63 flew over it in 1909			0
the super yacht is an experimental sailing hydrofoil designed by @entity14 yachtsman @entity67 and in full flight only 2.5 square metres of the boat are in contact with the water			2
this means that it can shoot from 20 to 45 knots ( 23mph to 51.5 mph ) in just 10 seconds			2
named after the @entity75 words for water and wing ( hydros and ptere ) the yacht uses the same principles as an aircraft to give it flight			2
to take off , @entity9 has ' marine wings ' , the foils , which are placed under each of the floats of the trimaran			1
once the boat reaches 10 knots , these immersed ' wings ' deploy at 45 degrees in the water and generate an upward thrust which raises the boat like the wing of a plane			1
then the hull and the floats of @entity9 fly five metres above the sea surface and as in the air , the higher the speed , the greater the lift			1
when fully extended , its carbon fibre sails and mast reach 28m high - the same height as the @entity104 ( minus the feet ) in @entity105 , @entity106			1
over years of trial and error the designers came up with a unique shape to optimise the sail efficiency and minimise air friction			0
the boat is made strong by the use of carbon fibre impregnanted with epoxy and titanium parts			0
it 's overall length is 74.7ft - three times longer than the average one bedroom @entity42 flat			2
it 's sail area in flight measures 560 m² - much bigger than new @entity42 one bedroom flats , which measure on average 76m			2
they also installed a hundred sensors which measure the pressures , the twisting or the speed which is analysed in a flight simulator to make minute adjustments			0
the design and the wings mean that the 78 - feet long yacht can shoot from 20 to 45 knots ( 23mph to 51.5 mph ) in just 10 seconds named after the @entity75 words for water and wing ( hydros and ptere ) the yacht uses the same principles as an aircraft to give it flight to take off , @entity9 has ' marine wings ' - the foils - which are placed under each of the floats of the trimaran			1
the crew has just a small amount of room in the hull - but will undoubtedly want to be perched on the wings , where they can enjoy the view whizzing by : the initial model was made in 1985 and , 20 years later in 2005 , it broke its first record the @entity9 earned the world record after sustaining a speed of 52.86 knots ( 97.90 km / h or 60.83 mph ) for 500 metres in 30 knots of wind			1
she later broke the 50 knot barrier for a nautical mile with a speed of 50.17 knots ( 92.91 km / h or 57.73 mph )			0
she did once manage 56.3 knots ( 104.3 km / h or 64.8 mph ) - but capsized shortly afterwards			0
the boat 's creators and team have spent years perfecting the awesome design			0
the initial model was made in 1985 , and 20 years later in 2005 , it broke its first record			0
in 2005 it crossed the @entity62 faster than @entity63 did by plane in 1909			0
the @entity9 then beat two world speed records ratified by the @entity175 ( @entity175 ) on 4th april 2007 : 44.81 knots of average speed over 500 meters and 41.69 knots of average speed over one nautical mile			1
june will see the yacht 's greatest challenge yet when she tries to set a new record for sailing from @entity182 to @entity183 in @entity184			0
the hull and the floats of @entity9 fly five meters above the sea surface , with just 2 m² of the boat surface left in contact with water with its mast and sails reaching a height of 28m , an owner would need a garage the height of the @entity104 statue in @entity105 in @entity106 to keep the yacht inside the @entity9 earned the world record after sustaining a speed of 52.86 knots ( 97.90 km / h or 60.83 mph ) for 500 metres in 30 knots of wind			1

@entity9 can reach speeds of 60mph using its giant ' wings ' to lift most of its frame above the water
@entity212 is 28m high - almost as tall as the @entity104 statue in @entity105 , @entity106
it can reach 50mph in ten seconds and has broken world records with its aeronautic design
