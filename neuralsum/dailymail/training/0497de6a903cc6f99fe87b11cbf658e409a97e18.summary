the @entity1 team will be battling their emotions and ‘ inner demons ’ when they play the first test since the death of @entity6			1
the @entity7 take on @entity8 tomorrow in a rescheduled first test at @entity6 ’s adopted home ground , the @entity11 , in what is sure to be an emotional atmosphere			1
players will wear @entity6 ’s @entity15 408 on their shirts , as well as black armbands			1
@entity1 will take on @entity8 in the first of a four - @entity20 series beginning on tuesday in @entity21 the @entity7 will wear a shirt with the number 408 , @entity6 ' test number , as well as black armbands the @entity11 will host the first test of the @entity7 summer and first since @entity6 died @entity27 ( left ) faces a short ball in the nets in @entity21 , while @entity31 ( right ) also practices they will line up on the outfield before the first day ’s play , in front of a giant 408 painted on the grass , to watch a video tribute to their former team - mate , which will be followed by 63 seconds of applause — the score on which @entity6 was unbeaten when he was fatally injured by a bouncer during a domestic @entity46 match just under two weeks ago			1
all - rounder @entity27 is one of four members of the @entity20 squad who were on the outfield at the @entity50 at the time @entity6 was struck while playing for @entity1			1
he is confident all squad members will be physically and emotionally ready to play but he spoke honestly and openly about the impact @entity6 ’s death has had on him since returning to training two days after the 25 - year - old ’s funeral			1
‘ mentally , it ’s been the most challenging couple of days i ’ve had to go through in my career , after seeing what happened over the past week , trying to process everything that happened , especially being there at the @entity50			0
‘ the first couple of sessions were tough , especially the first one			0
a few things flooded into my head as soon as i went out to bat … i thought i ’d processed quite well over the previous week			2
‘ this has been as important a four days ’ lead up to a test match that i have ever been involved in because there are a lot of inner demons that we ’ve had to find our way through			1
’ @entity1 's players have been training in @entity21 over the last few days after attending @entity6 ' funeral captain @entity79 looks set to play after struggling with back and hamstring injuries @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) compete for the ball during a training drill for @entity27 , one of those demons involves facing up to top quality , aggressive , fast bowling — something he has done without a second thought for 52 tests and 178 odis since his international debut in 2002			1
suddenly , having witnessed close up what happened to @entity6 , he has been struggling to put thoughts of the risks to one side when it comes to his own batting			2
‘ it ’s been a big challenge to try to put the memories that are very much in the front of my mind — very recent — to move them back a bit in my mind and trust what i do as a batsman			2
i know everyone ’s going to be in the same boat			0
‘ @entity114 is a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in			0
’ @entity27 admitted to feeling apprehensive about facing bouncers in the nets over the past couple of days , but said it got easier the more he batted — hence why he stayed in the nets half an hour longer than anyone else yesterday			2
‘ there was initially ( some apprehension ) , no doubt			0
but i ’ve got more comfortable with just reacting to what i see and trusting my skill			0
he added : ‘ you know that if at any stage you get a ball and you get unlucky and it hits you in the wrong spot it can cause some serious damage			0
@entity83 tries his luck at punting an @entity137 during practice at the @entity11 @entity139 ( left ) bowls in the nets as @entity31 ( right ) practices his catching ' i knew i had to confront it from day one when i went in , and every day that i ’ve gone in i ’ve felt more comfortable			0
’ captain @entity79 looks set to lead @entity1 after coming through a fitness test over the weekend			1
' he batted with purpose in the nets yesterday , having been struggling with a recurrence of his hamstring injury			0
his inclusion will give added poignancy to the opening day of the test match after being such a figure of support for the @entity6 family and delivering the most heartfelt and tearful of tributes			1
given the emotional burden @entity79 has shouldered , he has been excused from the captain ’s traditional eve - of - test press conference			0
that job has gone to @entity139 , @entity1 ’s chief aggressor with the ball , who roughed up the @entity162 batsmen during the last @entity164 series			2
@entity79 inspects the wicket at the @entity11 a couple of days before the first test against @entity8 @entity31 draws a crowd as he bats in the nets at the @entity11 there has been an international debate over the use of the bouncer in the wake of @entity6 ’s death but @entity27 is in no doubt that the @entity7 will go hard at @entity8			1
‘ we ’ve played our best cricket when we are aggressive			2
aggressive with bat and ball but especially with the ball , as we were during the last @entity164 series			0
that ’s not going to change because that ’s when we are at our absolute best			0
’ @entity185 chief executive @entity184 said he hoped the @entity20 will be an opportunity for supporters to pay tribute to @entity6			1
@entity8 will be the opposition for @entity1 in a four - test series that will begin on tuesday @entity190 could play in the first test having flown to @entity21 after recovering from a fractured thumb @entity8 batsman @entity193 looks on after breaking his bat during a net session ‘ soon after arriving in @entity196 became a crowd favourite , ’ he said			1
‘ this is an opportunity for those who embraced him so fondly to say their goodbye			0
’ when the 63 seconds of applause bursts out at the @entity11 it will be hard to avoid the thought that his score that day at the @entity50 would surely have seen him recalled to the test squad for the start of this series			0
perhaps , instead , this @entity20 will signify the start of a healing process for those players who were closest to @entity6			1
as silent mourning is replaced by ringing applause , a group of men will begin the hardest game of cricket they are likely to play in their lives .			2
