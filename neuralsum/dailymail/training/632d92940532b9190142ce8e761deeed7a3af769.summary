scientists in @entity1 believe an antidote for cocaine could be possible , after they identified a key protein that helps cause addiction it is an addiction that tears families apart , destroys lives and leads to financial ruin			1
now , a team of scientists believe they are a step closer to developing an antidote to cocaine addiction			1
researchers at the @entity17 have identified a protein - a dopamine transporter - that could help in the development of future treatments			1
currently no medical treatment exists to combat a reliance on the drug			2
in theory , the new treatment would work in a similar way to how methadone works for heroin addicts			1
in essence , the treatment would stop the drug having any pleasurable effect			0
associate professor @entity34 , from the department of neuroscience and pharmacology , said though the drug is not a ' wonder drug ' it would work in a similar way to how methadone is used to treat heroin abuse			1
' if we have a better understanding of the dopamine transporter function we will become more proficient in developing an antidote against cocaine addiction , ' he said			1
' it would aid in the treatment of cocaine addiction , but the patient would have to be willing to go to rehab and other actions have to be taken in addition to this , ' he told @entity56			1
he added : ' we found two amino acids in the proteins that dynamically breaks and forms an interaction			0
' the dynamic is therefore crucial for the transport process			0
' cocaine acts as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter			0
dopamine is a signalling molecule in the brain which is linked to a person 's sensation of reward , motivation , and addiction			0
the newly - discovered protein acts as a ' vacuum cleaner ' removing the released dopamine , thereby controlling its signalling			0
the scientists discovered an interaction , a so - called gate , which controls access for dopamine to its binding site in the protein			2
but the scientists discovered other inhibitors , which though they bind to the dopamine transporter with the same strength as cocaine , do not provoke the same simulatory response , when tested in rats			2
' our objective here is that cocaine will not then work any more as the antidote will inhibit the stimulatory response of taking this drug , ' concluded professor @entity34			2
he added further research will be necessary			0
the results have been published in the @entity100			0
the protein - a dopamine inhibitor - could help in the development of future treatments			1
dopamine , pictured , is a signalling molecule in the brain which is linked to a person 's sense of reward , motivation and addiction			0

antidote to cocaine addiction is a step closer , say @entity1 scientists
identified a protein that could form basis of future treatments
researcher says drug would work in similar way to methadone for heroin
