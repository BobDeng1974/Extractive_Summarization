@entity11 's chairman , co-founder and former ceo admitted the tricky combination of keys used to reboot machines was not well thought out			1
the hand - stretching command that is sometimes referred to by computer geeks as the ' three finger salute , ' is used by many as a last - resort when trying to stop programs from running			1
in the early 1990s it became a popular way of banishing the infamous ' blue screen of death '			0
speaking at a @entity41 fundraising campaign , mr @entity1 said : we could have had a single button , but the guy who did the @entity46 keyboard design did n't want to give us our single button			1
' he explained the original idea was to use a taxing key combination to ensure it was difficult for other software to fake a log - in screen and steal passwords			0
a worker at @entity46 called @entity57 , who was partially responsible for the design of the first @entity46 pc created the command , the @entity60 reported , which was originally intended to reset the computer			2

mirroring what critics have been saying for years , mr @entity1 said @entity11 was slow to develop a smartphone and tablet , lagging behind @entity96 's lead .			0
