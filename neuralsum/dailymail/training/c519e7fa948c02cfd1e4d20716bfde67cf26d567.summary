the speech pattern is associated with young women from southern @entity2 , notably clueless lead character @entity3 first men became enamoured with grooming regimes , but now it seems the metrosexual man has started talking in a more feminine way too			1
a new study has revealed that modern men are starting to ‘ uptalk ’ by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences			1
the speech pattern is associated with young women from southern @entity2 , notably clueless lead character @entity3 , but is now common amongst younger people			2
scientists came across the finding when they were trying to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question			1
uptalkers are stereotypically parodied as insecure , shallow and not very clever females			1
however , scientists from the @entity26 , who recorded the voices of 24 young southern @entity2 , found that the 12 men they studied also uptalked and the speakers came from different backgrounds - not just mansions in @entity33			1
they were given several speech tasks , such as providing directions from a map , or recounting what happened after watching a clip from a popular sitcom			0
‘ we found use of uptalk in all of our speakers , despite their diverse backgrounds in socio - economic status , ethnicity , bilingualism and gender , ’ study leader dr @entity40 , a linguist at the university said			0
the research , which was presented at the annual meeting of the @entity53 in @entity54 , identified a crucial difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question			1
in a statement , the rise in pitch began significantly later than in a question			2
scientists discovered that @entity2 men have begun to ' uptalk ' by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences when they set out to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question but the difference was so subtle that non-uptalkers often missed it , according to professor @entity74 , formerly at the @entity26 , who is now at the @entity76			1
‘ our study busts the stereotype associated with uptalk that those who speak uptalk actually ask questions instead of make statements , a tendency that is supposed to be linked to insecurity , ' she said			0
‘ but native southern @entity2 speakers know the difference based on the exact location of the rise start , and the extent to which pitch changes in the rise			2

the essential ingredient for a man to become a successful boss lies in a deep voice			0
research by @entity106 in @entity107 has discovered that men with lower voices make more money , run larger companies , and stay in their jobs longer - although they did not examine the way in which someone speaks beyond pitch			2
specialists studied 792 male chief executives of @entity119 companies and found a distinct correlation between wages and the pitch of voices			1
those with deeper voices had a distinct advantage over their high - pitched peers , as they were found to earn more			0
the median ceo of the study was a 56 - year - old with a 125.5 hz vocal frequency and earned £ 2.4 million ( $ 3.7 million ) for leading a £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) company , the @entity128 reported			0
executives with voices on the deeper end of the scale earned , on average , £ 121,000 ( $ 187,000 ) more in pay and ran operations with £ 286 million ( $ 440 million ) more in assets			0
researchers claim that lower pitched voices are linked to dominant behaviour , because deep voices are related to high testosterone levels , the @entity128 reported .			0

scientists from the @entity26 , recorded the voices of 24 young people and found that the 12 men they studied ' uptalked '
uptalking or speaking like a ' *valley* girl ' involves rising in pitch at the ends of sentences and is often associated with insecure and shallow girls
