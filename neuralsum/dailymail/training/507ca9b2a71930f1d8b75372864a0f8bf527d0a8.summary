explosive claims : @entity1 , @entity2 's former chief of staff , said @entity3 was used as a ' transit location ' for the @entity7 government 's ' nefarious activities ' after 9/11 interrogations of terror suspects took place on the @entity12 overseas territory of @entity3 , according to a senior official in @entity15 's administration			1
@entity1 said ' nefarious activities ' had occurred on the @entity18 island , which the @entity12 leases to the @entity7 military			1
and he said it was ' difficult to think ' the @entity12 authorities were unaware that detainees were being questioned			0
the former @entity25 aide 's revelations will increase the pressure on @entity27 to order a public inquiry into the extent of @entity12 's involvement in the @entity33 's rendition and torture programme			1
ministers say the island was used just twice as a refuelling stop for extraordinary rendition flights – where terror suspects are moved to secret prisons for torture			2
but they insist no detainees set foot on the atoll – a claim now seriously undermined by mr @entity1 , who was @entity7 secretary of state @entity2 's chief of staff between 2002 and 2005			1
he said he received the information about interrogations on @entity3 from four well - placed @entity33 and intelligence sources , including a veteran of the renditions programme and an official who was ' very much plugged in to what was going on at the @entity33 ' after he retired			0
it is the first time a senior @entity15 administration official has stated on the record that the remote @entity12 territory was a part of the @entity33 's global network of secret ' black site ' prisons			2
in an interview with @entity65 , a website , he said it was known as a place to get things done ' out of the limelight '			0
' no one has indicated there was a detention site there , not in so many words , ' said mr @entity1			0
' what they indicated is that interrogations took place there			0
' he said there was no permanent detention facility on the outcrop , but added : ' what i heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure , or unavailable			2
' so you might have a case where you simply go in and use a facility at @entity3 for a month , or two weeks , or whatever , and you do your nefarious activities there			0
' it 's difficult for me to think that we could do anything there of any duration to speak of without the @entity12 knowing – at least the @entity12 on the island – knowing what we were doing			0
that does n't mean @entity104 knew			0
' @entity1 was @entity2 's ( left ) former chief of staff during the @entity15 ( right ) administration the @entity108 veteran , who served on the island during the 1980s , added : ' a general theme i heard was that the @entity12 were very cooperative with everything			1
' number 10 is already facing accusations that ministers pressed the @entity7 @entity117 intelligence committee to redact any reference to @entity3 from its damning report into @entity120 , who was @entity121 's top legal adviser , has said he has ' no recollection ' of whether discussions took place over using @entity3 as a black site			0
@entity127 , the @entity128 ' former special envoy on torture , has said he had been told detainees were held on @entity3 in 2002 and 2003			0
@entity131 , a director at human rights charity @entity132 said : ' this suggests the @entity134 has not told the whole truth			0
' ministers have consistently claimed only two @entity33 rendition victims ever landed on @entity3 – @entity1 's comments suggest that either they have n't been honest with the public , or the @entity7 government has n't been honest with them			1
' a @entity142 spokesman said : ' the @entity7 government has assured us that , apart from the two cases in 2002 , there have been no other instances in which @entity7 intelligence flights landed in the @entity12 , our overseas territories , or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september , 2001			1
' @entity3 is midway between @entity152 and the southern tip of @entity154 and was leased by @entity12 to the @entity7 , which turned it into a vast military base @entity1 , 70 , did not learn about what was happening on @entity3 ( pictured ) until after he left office the island is midway between @entity152 and the southern tip of @entity154 and was leased by @entity12 to the @entity7 , which turned it into a vast military base			2
@entity1 said he thinks it 's unlikely the @entity12 military personnel on @entity3 had not noticed the arrival and departure of prisoners			2
the @entity12 government claims only two rendition flights have passed through the island when they stopped to refuel in 2002			1
@entity131 , a director at @entity104 - based human rights charity @entity132 , said : ' this suggests the @entity134 has not told the whole truth about @entity3 's part in the @entity33 's torture programme			2
' ministers have consistently claimed only two @entity33 rendition victims ever landed on @entity3 – @entity1 's comments suggest that either they have n't been honest with the public , or the @entity7 government has n't been honest with them			1
' a @entity142 spokesman said : ' the @entity7 government has assured us that , apart from the two cases in 2002 , there have been no other instances in which @entity7 intelligence flights landed in the @entity12 , our overseas territories , or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september , 2001			1
