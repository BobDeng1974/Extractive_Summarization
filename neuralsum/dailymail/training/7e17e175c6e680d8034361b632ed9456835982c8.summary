@entity1 could sue @entity3 authorities for attempting to use his sexuality as evidence against him , a lawyer said today			1
in their bungled prosecution , state lawyers tried to argue that his liaisons with gay prostitutes revealed a possible motive for wanting his wife murdered as a ' way out ' of the marriage			1
the move apparently prompted @entity1 to reveal on day one of the trial – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – intimate details of his private life in a bid to negate the claims			1
it paved the way for his defence team to call for their client 's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and judge @entity29 duly agreed , angrily throwing out their submissions on more than once occasion			2
@entity3 lawyer @entity33 said @entity1 could seek damages if he can show prosecutors had unjustifiably used his sexuality as evidence			1
he told @entity37 : ' he could have a case for malicious prosecution			1
@entity1 could sue @entity3 authorities for attempting to use his sexuality as evidence against him , including intimate details of sex sessions with gay prostitute @entity43 ( right ) ' defendants can recover expenses for the harm they have suffered and infringement of rights of personality suffered by being falsely prosecuted			1
‘ they can make a claim where the prosecution brings up material they know is inadmissible to blacken the character of the accused			2
' mr @entity33 , an attorney at the university of @entity57 's law clinic who specialises in claims against the police , said there have been defamation cases against witnesses in the past even when they had told the truth in court			0
' if an advocate made a defamatory statement during the course of the proceedings , which was not relevant to the proceedings , then equally the advocate could be held liable , ’ he added			0
' it is not enough that the information published is truthful			0
it must be in the interest of the public to receive the information			0
' state lawyers tried to argue that his liaisons with gay prostitutes revealed a possible motive for wanting his wife @entity83 ( pictured ) murdered as a ' way out ' of the marriage the prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to @entity1 's homosexuality , including @entity43 , known as the @entity91 master , and a detective from @entity93 who retrieved a bundle of sexually - explicit e-mails between @entity1 and an older man			1
but judge @entity29 furiously accused the prosecution of presenting ' irrelevant ' evidence when @entity43 took the stand to detail sex sessions he and @entity1 had in the months leading up to the honeymoon murder			1
the allegation that @entity1 had told the @entity105 - based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed ' to find a way out ' of his engagement to @entity83 and other conversations they 'd shared , was not allowed to be shared with the court , the judge ruled			2
prosecutor @entity114 attempted to argue that since @entity1 had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on ' hook - up ' websites such as @entity119 and @entity120 , the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards hew new bride			2
' premier gay dating site ' : @entity1 logged on to hook - up website @entity119 ( above ) on october 15 , 2010 , as he prepared for his £ 200,000 wedding in @entity126 later that month , mr @entity43 alleged for men into leather , rubber and kink : @entity43 also set up a profile on @entity120 ( above ) under the name @entity133 , where he offered ' escort services ' with emphasis on ' fetish , sadomasochism and role - play ' judge @entity29 disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what @entity43 was prepared to say			2
she also ruled out as hearsay much of the testimony from @entity145 , @entity83 ’s first cousin , who had been asked to testify about how @entity83 felt sexually rejected by him			0
however , mr @entity33 said @entity1 's chances of a successful claim were slim			1
' i would not be prepared to represent him because my advice would be that he has got a weak case			0
' it is harder to prove because the onus is on the defendant to show it was malicious			0
' in the particular case in question , it seems that the material may have been relevant ( it was brought up in the plea explanation by the accused , for example )			0
' the claimant should be wary of launching proceedings			0
' @entity166 , a senior defence barrister who specialises in murder cases , said @entity1 would face another dilemma if he decided to sue as it would force him into the witness box			2
he told @entity37 : ' in such a claim , the onus would be on @entity1 to prove that the case against him was malicious , meaning he could not avoid giving evidence under oath			1
' he simply could n't do that , judging by the various versions he has given police over time and now to the court in his plea explanation , he is likely to make a shocking witness			0
' no lawyer acting for him would advise him to do that			0

care home owner could have a case against @entity3 prosecutors
he could claim his sexuality was *unfairly* exposed as part of the case
lawyers say : ' @entity1 could seek damages for malicious prosecution '
