by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 04:15 est , 11 december 2012 @entity1 was forced to undergo major surgery after swallowing his magnetic tongue studs a fashion craze almost cost a teenage boy his life after he swallowed the magnetic tongue studs he was wearing			1
@entity1 , 15 , was only hours from death and needed surgery when the studs , which are much more powerful than ordinary magnets , began making holes in his digestive system			1
the metal decorations , usually from three to five millimetres across , are worn on either side of the tongue , held in place by their magnetism so they look like a piercing but without the hole			1
but they can react with stomach acids and cause lethal internal damage			0
if they end up in different parts of the intestine the powerful magnets in some studs can make holes in the soft tissue as they are drawn back together			2
last night @entity1 ’s family issued a warning to youngsters to be aware of the danger if they were to swallow the studs , which are freely available in @entity38			1
they are popular because they allow teenagers to look as if they have had a piercing without incurring the wrath of their parents			0
@entity1 swallowed his on the bus to school but thought nothing more about it until a fortnight later when he began to have crippling stomach ache			1
he was admitted to hospital as an emergency with suspected appendicitis			0
surgeons had to cut into his bowel in three places to retrieve the studs and later told him he had been only four hours from dying			1
he was one of four pupils at @entity59 ’s @entity58 in @entity60 , @entity61 , who swallowed the jewellery			0
three girls , aged between 13 and 16 , were admitted and given the all - clear			2
the magnets are designed to sit on either side of the tongue			1
right : surgeons at @entity70 had to cut into @entity1 's bowel in three places to retrieve the magnetic studs the school has urged any other pupils who swallowed the studs to go straight to hospital			1
@entity1 , of @entity77 , @entity61 , said : ‘ it was a really frightening experience			1
‘ i could n’t walk , talk or even move , and the thought that i could be dead if i had n’t gone into hospital is really scary			0
‘ they could n’t figure out what was wrong with me , and found them when they put a camera inside me and the magnets stuck to the camera			2
‘ i just had a really intense stomach ache but it never occurred to me that it might have been the studs			0
‘ i ’d swallowed them two weeks before but just thought they ’d pass through			0
a ct scan of @entity94 schoolgirl @entity93 clearly shows the magnetic balls , which stuck to her small intestine and began burrowing through it ‘ i thought they were safe but now i know how serious magnets can be and i ’d say to anyone who uses these studs that you ’re putting yourself in real danger by putting them in your mouth			2
’ @entity1 spent almost a week in hospital and now faces a four - week wait to find out if the damage to his bowel will be permanent			1
his father , also called @entity1 , said : ‘ if he ’d been a seven or eight - year - old it could have killed him			1
it ’s really important that people are made aware of the dangers			0
’ it is believed the studs had been distributed around the school by another pupil who had brought them back from a holiday			0
the packaging defined the product as ‘ facial studs ’ and showed a cartoon picture of a boy wearing the accessory on his tongue			0
@entity129 , deputy head at @entity59 ’s , said : ‘ as soon as we were aware of what had happened to @entity1 , we circulated warnings to the parents and the teachers and we also made other schools in the area aware of what had happened			1
‘ we also urged any pupils who thought they may have swallowed anything magnetic to go straight to hospital as a precautionary measure			0
‘ our thoughts are with @entity1 and his family at what has been a very distressing time and we are glad to see the message is getting out there of the potential dangers			2
’ the fashion accessories have already been flagged up as a potential health risk in @entity151 following a number of similar cases			0
last year , @entity93 , 13 , of @entity154 in @entity94 , required surgery after magnetic studs that she had swallowed made several holes in her intestines .			2

magnets are designed to sit on either side of the tongue to hold stud in place
@entity1 needed surgery after *accidentally* swallowing them
magnets ripped through his intestines and acid damaged his bowel
teenager was four hours from death when he had life - *saving* surgery
