by @entity0 @entity2 owner @entity1 has urged @entity3 to name names in future the next time they attempt to drop teams in trouble			1
@entity3 president and managing director @entity9 revealed last week at least one team had not paid their bill with regard to their supply of this season 's power units			1
@entity9 admitted the late payments were ' a serious concern ' and that the critical point was ' just weeks away '			2
let 's be clear ! @entity2 owner @entity1 insists they 've paid @entity3 for this season 's power supply with four teams as @entity3 customers - @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity2 and @entity29 - the belief at the time was that @entity9 could not be referring to the former two marques , given their resources in being backed by energy drinks billionaire @entity33			1
the obvious deduction was @entity9 was pointing an accusing finger at @entity2 and @entity29 , both of whom are reputed to be struggling financially			1
@entity29 team principal @entity38 insisted his marque had paid up , leaving only @entity2 as the sole team under suspicion			1
following sunday 's @entity42 @entity41 , @entity1 was seen engaged in talks with @entity3 bosses in his team 's motorhome at the @entity47 in @entity47			1
seemingly to clear the air , @entity1 said : ' this is why we had a meeting , because i wanted them to clarify their price			2
' i said to them if they are going to say things , then name the team that is an issue			0
' do n't just say ' teams ' and then expect people to make their own judgements			0
we respect the arrangements we have with them			0
' if there is ( somebody who has not paid ) , it must be somebody else , but i 'm not even sure there is , to be honest with you , so we 'll see			0
' tricky time : @entity70 has picked up just four points during this season 's @entity73 championship asked directly whether @entity2 had paid up , @entity1 replied : ' we 've paid up			1
we 're absolutely in line with them			0
' the situation , however , did not detract from @entity2 ' best result of a previously troubled season as the @entity82 - based marque scored points for the first time this campaign			2
from a season - high fifth on the grid , @entity70 finished eighth , dropping three places according to @entity1 due to an electronic issue with the power unit for a couple of laps			1
@entity1 had previously insisted @entity42 would effectively be the start of his team 's season , and so it proved , and now he has high hopes			2
' we 've been saying from the beginning of the season we have a really good car , but it 's been tough because of the foundations we had , ' he said			0
' in theory , we have a car that is behind @entity106 - well , everyone is behind @entity106 ! - but closer to @entity26 , and then able to fight and beat pretty much any other car			0
' this is one more step of confirmation , but only that , so we need to keep on pushing and working			0
' but i think we will now have a normal season , which for us is being able to fight for being the third , fourth team ( in the constructors ' championship )			0
