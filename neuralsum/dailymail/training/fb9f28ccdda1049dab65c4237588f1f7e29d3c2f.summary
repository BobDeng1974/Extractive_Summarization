it follows concern that there are too few staff to cope with the soaring numbers turning up in @entity9			1
but the demand drew an angry response from patients ’ groups , one of which said : ‘ it ’s not a part - time business they ’re working in , it ’s a full - time job			2
’ tough job : casualty doctors say they must be paid double to work evenings and weekends , following concern that there are too few staff to cope with the soaring numbers turning up in @entity9			1
( @entity26 picture ) yesterday a report by the @entity28 warned that 80 per cent of emergency departments did not always have a consultant working during the 16 busiest hours of the day			2
and the @entity31 said there is a ‘ recruitment crisis ’ , with too few junior doctors wanting to pursue a career in @entity9 because it is so demanding			1
its president dr @entity36 , an @entity9 consultant , said the @entity37 needed an extra 300 doctors in casualty to ensure patients were properly cared for round the clock			1
he said their terms and conditions should be ‘ amended ’ – with higher pay for out - of - hours work – to make the profession more attractive			1
at present , @entity9 doctors ’ hourly pay is about 25 per cent more for overnight and weekend shifts			1
but dr @entity36 said the salary calculations should be changed so doctors working shifts after midnight would receive twice the hourly rate , allowing them to take more time off while earning a similar salary			1
but well remunerated : dr @entity36 said salary calculations should be changed so doctors working after midnight receive twice the hourly rate , allowing them to take more time off while earning a similar salary ‘ it ’s not because we want people to earn more money , it ’s because they need more time back , ’ added dr @entity36 , a consultant at the @entity60 and @entity61 hospitals trust			1
‘ a doctor would work two nights a week , and then one weekend in three but then he would actually get nine days off			0
' it would mean , yes , you work these antisocial hours , but you would get quite a bit of time off , usually in blocks , which means you could do something else with your life			0
’ recruitment crisis : too few junior doctors want to pursue a career in @entity9 because it is so demanding , said the @entity31 he said the @entity37 has failed to recruit 100 junior doctors into senior posts in @entity9 for the last three years running			1
consultants earn an average of £ 108,000 a year while middle - grade doctors are on salaries of between £ 60,000 and £ 80,000			0
if their pay were to be increased , the impact on their salaries would depend on how many out - of - hours shifts they did in @entity9			1
@entity92 , of @entity93 , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely ridiculous to demand doctors be paid more			0
it ’s not a part - time business they ’re working in , it ’s a full - time job			2
' if you work in @entity9 that ’s your job to work unsociable hours – that ’s what patients expect and what patients need			2
you should n’t go into it if you want short hours – it is n’t that sort of job			0
' doctors in @entity9 departments are n’t the only people who have to work nights and weekends , so why should they earn more ? ’ conservative @entity116 , who serves on the @entity117 , said : ‘ i ’d like to think that the vast majority of people who go into medicine do it because they want to give back to the community and that means working unsociable hours			1
‘ i ’m on a good wage and i volunteer with the ambulance service to help others			0
doctors are on an even better wage			0
‘ to suggest they should get paid more is effectively to say that more of the @entity37 budget should be spent on their salaries and that less should be spent on patient care , which is unacceptable			0
’ he added : ‘ doctors do work very hard , and are very dedicated to their training but to say they should be paid more is a bit cheeky			2
‘ what should drive you is the want to give back to the community			0
public service is a privilege and those who work in the public sector are rewarded handsomely in their pay and pension schemes as it is			0
‘ now is not the time to argue more should be spent on salaries			0
’ yesterday a report by mps on the @entity28 warned that @entity9 units would be unable to cope with the surge in sick patients this winter			1
last year more than a quarter of a million extra patients turned up in casualty compared with the previous 12 months and the numbers are expected to rise further			0
this increase has been blamed on a failure of @entity163 out - of - hours services – which leaves patients with nowhere else to go – on top of the ageing population with higher numbers of the elderly becoming ill. the problems have been worsened by the @entity37 helpline with patients being sent down to @entity9 unnecessarily by unqualified call centre handlers			2
dame @entity174 , chief operating officer of @entity175 , the body that runs the @entity177 , said : ‘ it ’s very disappointing that accident and emergency departments do n’t have as much consultant cover as we would all wish them to have			0
‘ we need to work much harder at making this an attractive profession for young doctors			2
if you do n’t have the best possible resource , that can compromise the best treatment			0

doctors ’ hourly pay is now 25 per cent more for night and weekend shifts
but casualty wards are suffering ' recruitment crisis ' because job is so hard
doctors argue that better pay would make working in them more attractive
@entity152 warn @entity9 wards may be unable to cope with patient surge this winter
