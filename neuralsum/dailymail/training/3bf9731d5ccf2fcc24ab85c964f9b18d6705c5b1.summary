@entity0 has questioned @entity2 's decision to deploy @entity3 as a holding midfielder , insisting the @entity6 star is an ' attacking ' player who ' is stuck between two roles ' at the moment			1
@entity3 was utilised in front of the back four for the @entity10 against @entity11 and @entity0 feels that his talent is being misused and wasted due to both @entity2 and @entity13 constantly switching the 22 - year - old 's role in the side			1
writing in his column in @entity21 , former @entity17 and @entity18 said : ' i still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield ( for @entity10 ) and most of all about @entity3 ’s role in it			2
new role : @entity0 does not believe @entity3 ( right ) should be deployed as a holding midfielder opinionated : @entity0 ( pictured ) believes that @entity3 's best role is as an ' attacking midfielder ' strong : @entity3 has always been a player who can dive into a tackle , but can improve that part of his game ' do n’t get me wrong , @entity3 has great ability and at some point i hope that he will be in a position to score goals and to create them			1
' but i just do not believe that playing in front of the back four , on his own , suits him			0
' the 11 - time @entity43 winner also made comparisons between @entity3 and himself , believing both to be ' attacking ' midfielders by nature			0
@entity0 claims @entity3 is being asked to play in an undefined role , almost a middle - ground between attacking and defensive midfield			1
he continued : ' @entity3 is an attacking midfielder , as i was for most of my career			2
he is not a defensive midfielder and i feel at the moment he is stuck between the two roles			0
he is being asked to control the play from a deep position , which does not play to his strengths			0
' attributes : @entity13 believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back improving : the @entity6 midfielder was happy with his first game in the position , but wants to get better versatile : the @entity6 man can play in any of the three central midfield positions at his club			0

@entity0 question @entity2 's decision to play @entity3 deep
*ex-manchester* @entity17 star thinks @entity3 is better suited further *forward*
@entity3 was given @entity10 's holding - midfielder role against @entity11
@entity0 says the 22 - year - old is an ' attacking ' and not ' holding ' midfielder
questions why @entity3 yet to be given defined role for @entity6 or @entity10
@entity0 claims @entity3 is an ' attacking midfielder ' just like he was
