whether it ’s streaming countless episodes of @entity2 , or uploading super high - resolution photos , our desire for faster internet grows daily			1
but despite the many benefits it can bring , experts are predicting a darker side to having superfast connections			2
by 2025 , as speeds soar , we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues , dubbed ‘ cloud immigrants ’ , operating systems built inside the body , hackers causing havoc in the home , and precognition apps			1
by 2025 , as speeds soar , experts predict we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues , dubbed ‘ cloud immigrants ’ ( pictured ) , that could increase competition for jobs			1
they also expect operating systems to be built inside the body , hackers to cause havoc in the home , and precognition apps the predictions were made as part of @entity33 ’s @entity32 in the @entity35 report			1
it was commissioned to mark last year 's 25th anniversary of the creation of the @entity39 by sir @entity40			0
the report covers expert views about what impacts faster bandwidth speeds could have on the world , economies , work life and more			1
‘ over the past few decades people have been sharing and accessing magnitudes more information online annually , ’ explained the report			2
‘ in 2014 , @entity51 and @entity52 were among the innovators announcing that they are testing the capabilities for currently installed networks to carry data even more efficiently - at 10 gigabits per second - to businesses that handle large amounts of internet traffic			2
‘ to explore the possibilities of the next leap in connectivity we asked thousands of experts to share their thoughts about likely new activities and applications that might emerge in the gigabit age			1
gigabit connectivity ( 1,000 mbps ) is still limited globally , and although average speeds vary greatly , gigabit connections are 50 - 100 times faster than the average fixed high - speed connection			1
these speeds will advance current technologies , such as prediction apps like @entity74 and @entity75 ( pictured ) ‘ one interesting area of cognitive research is precognition , or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them , even in the space of a nanosecond ’ explained @entity79 , director of design at a research firm			1
@entity74 's predictive analysis already carries out a similar task ‘ the expectation of most of the more than 1,460 people who participated in this canvassing of experts is that as this connectivity becomes more common , online life will be significantly changed			1
’ for example , as @entity96 , a technology futures speaker and futurist , explained : ‘ no doubt the killer app will be real - life holograms operating in real time : for instance , as doctors , as surgeons , as coworkers			1
‘ it will change the workplace			2
not only will it diminish the need for business travel , it will also increase competition			0
‘ whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area , immigrants for example , in the future you have to compete with ‘ cloud immigrants ’ - coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram			1
’ @entity123 ’s learning designer dr. @entity122 told @entity124 she believes in the future , pen and paper will be replaced with tablets , and apps will project onto a shared screen			1
every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day , and send stats to parents @entity123 ’s learning designer dr. @entity122 told @entity124 she believes in the future , pen and paper in classrooms will be replaced with tablets , and apps will project onto shared screens			2
every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day , and these will send stats to parents and teachers			0
family web portals for close communication between parents and teachers , as well as between students , will develop further			0
students will be able to collaborate on homework , and parents will be able to talk to each other about workload and behaviour			0
dr @entity156 also thinks that students will soon be able to video conference with other classes around the world			0
this could lead to foreign exchange trips become virtual			0
and voice recognition technology will be fitted in tablets and ebook readers to help children pronounce vocabulary and support second - language learning			0
‘ teachers often struggle to deliver instruction at the right level for everyone in their class , given class sizes and varying competencies within their student population , ’ explained dr @entity156			2
‘ educational games can provide students with the concepts they need to learn , presented in fun and compelling ways , and with the types of support they need when they need it			0
she said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum , including skills such as collaboration , grit and perseverance , music and creativity , and problem solving skills			0
‘ technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives , such as physical activity and health			2
‘ and there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they ’re having fun			2
‘ simultaneously , there is a movement growing to ensure that children have access to , and understand how to , play			0
’ @entity214 , a professor at @entity215 , based in @entity216 , added : ‘ @entity217 will take an ugly turn as hackers , cyber security swat teams , advertisers , and terrorists run amok through citizens ' and nations ' refrigerators , heating systems , power grids , and pacemakers			1
’ she predicts that this will see lawyers becoming specifically qualified to deal with product liability , and in turn switching the fault from the manufacturer to the machine			0
‘ problems with rogue nanobots and genetically engineered diseases will dwarf concerns about the internet , ’ she continued			2
design research consultant @entity241 said : ‘ the operating system will be integrated into the human body			1
i predict killer apps that control objects through thought			1
' she also believes such operating systems could lead to ‘ super powers ’ including x-ray vision , super hearing and mind control ( @entity254 's @entity253 pictured ) ms @entity79 continued that superfast speeds will help develop a tool that intelligently recognises ' our choices and behaviours '			1
she believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body , that are only turned on when needed			0
this image shows the various parts that make up the @entity267 electronic tattoo called the @entity268 in 2013 , former @entity270 chairman @entity269 issued a @entity271 , urging all 50 @entity272 states to have at least one community with gigabit internet access by 2015 this year			0
gigabit connectivity ( 1,000 mbps ) is still limited globally , and although average speeds vary greatly , gigabit connections are 50 to 100 times faster than the average fixed high - speed connection			1
these speeds will help advance current technologies , such as prediction apps like @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity281			2
‘ one interesting area of cognitive research is precognition , or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them , even in the space of a nanosecond , ’ explained @entity79 , director of unnnamed design firm in the report			2
‘ a tool that intelligently recognises our likely choices and behaviours , without overloading with information , then allows us to modify our choices based on a predictive outcome of those choices could play a key role in self - awareness , self - development , empathy , creativity , and our fundamental desire to feel connection to others ’			1
the experts did predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education to be brought about by superfast broadband			0
in particular , health monitoring will be ‘ cheaper and more convenient ’ , and will be done at home rather than at hospitals			1
and robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace ( illustrated ) there is already a trend being seen for this , with doctors carrying out @entity325 consultations ( pictured ) she believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body , that are only turned on when needed			0
this is a prediction shared , somewhat , by design research consultant @entity241 : ‘ the operating system will be integrated into the human body			1
‘ i predict killer apps that control objects through thought - drug implants , virus detectors , stimulants and narcotics , virtual reality games , privacy and identity hiding tools , virtual pornography , robotic pets , robotic personal helpers , virtual wars , forced sterilizations , or birth control			1
futurist @entity351 recently said he believes technology is easing people away from ‘ mass medicine and treatment ’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual , whether that be at home or in public hospitals			1
sensors will soon be able to relief pain , as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body			0
material , food , water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so - called @entity371 , where everything is tracked , has sensors , and can communicate with each other			0
and within 25 years , mr @entity351 said jobs such as bankers , receptionists , call centre and warehouse operatives , will become redundant , with occupations such as ' cyborg engineers ' and ' crime predictors ' becoming common			0
she also believes that human operating systems could lead to ‘ super powers ’ including x-ray vision , super hearing and mind control			1
the experts did also predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education that will be brought about by superfast broadband			0
in particular , health monitoring will be ‘ cheaper and more convenient ’ , and will be done at home rather than at hospitals , explained @entity398 , chief economist at @entity51			1
‘ indeed , the home security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course , [ and ] robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace			1
’ there is already a trend emerging , with doctors carrying out @entity325 consultations			0
the experts also said that diets and treatments tailored to individuals based on their dna , analysed on superfast computers with vast amounts of data being processed all the time , will revolutionise treatments and save lives			1
@entity419 , founder and president of @entity421 wrote : tools will monitor us from birth and predict sickness and heal us faster			0
‘ genetics will be patented and evolve to have cures to current and new disease that will arise			0
all of this will happen rapidly			0
’ she added that people will be able to connect with others who share similar dna and experience a ‘ personal connection to focus on prevention versus treatment ’			2
and , when it comes to education , she said there will be an app for every child 's learning ability or disability : ‘ @entity443 will be learning and tracking 24/7 , while sharing their experience with selected - in peers and networks			2
' everyone will be the media and a newsmaker			0
journalism will be more personal and targeted			0

@entity33 *interviewed* 1,460 experts about the next ‘ killer apps ’
they were asked to explain how the world will change as web speeds rise
in particular , what impact will the *rollout* of gigabit speeds have globally
answers ranged from the rise of holographic work colleagues , operating systems inside the body , and hackers causing havoc in the home
health monitoring will become ' cheaper and more convenient '
treatments and diets could be tailored to individuals based on their dna
and the future of the classroom will be high - tech and virtual
