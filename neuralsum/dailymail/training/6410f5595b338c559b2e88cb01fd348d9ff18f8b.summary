by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 05:09 est , 6 november 2012 the devastation wrought by @entity2 could have been avoided by a simple but ingenious technology made from old car tyres , @entity6 's leading marine engineer claims			1
thousands of car tyres lashed together to support tubes extending deep into the ocean could avert hurricanes , says @entity11 , emeritus professor of engineering design at @entity12			1
with the backing of @entity14 billionaires @entity15 and @entity17 's company @entity16 , he has patented the idea but says further funding is urgently needed to research the scheme			2
the @entity22 section of @entity23 , @entity24 , as @entity2 struck the @entity25 last week : the huge storm wrought devastation across the @entity28 and the east coast of the @entity25 hurricanes are areas of intense low pressure that form over warm ocean waters			1
the source of their energy is water vapour which evaporates from the ocean surfaces , fuelling the storm with the latent heat of condensation			0
the so - called ' @entity41 ' harnesses wave power to in effect stir up the ocean , bringing cooler water from below stopping the surface from reaching the kinds of temperatures that cause the most devastating hurricanes			1
it works as a wave - powered pump , with the ocean swell pushing hot water into the top of the cylinder , with gravity then pushing that water down as far as 200m where it mixes with the cool deep			1
over time , this action mixes the ocean waters bringing surface temperatures down and lessening the potential for a devastating hurricane to form			2
how it works : a ring 80 - 100 meters across floats on an assembly of discarded tires , lashed together and filled with a buoyant substance , such as foamed concrete harnessing wave power : the surface of the ring rises a meter or so above the sea level			2
@entity75 swells passing over the structure fill it with warm surface water mixing up the oceans : a tube connected to the inside of the ring sinks 50 - 300 meters to the cooler water below			1
gradually the tube fills with warm water , which drains out the bottom			0
it has a tapered profile to accelerate the velocity of the flow and to improve mixing of the warm exhaust water with the colder water at depth @entity16 suggests sinks ranging from 10m to 100m in diameter could potentially remove heat from the surface of the ocean at gigwatt rates			2
professor @entity11 told the @entity100 that harnessing energy from waves to cool the ocean to makes ecological sense			1
the pumps would be placed in ' hurricane alley ' , the region of the @entity23 around the equator where the worst storms form			2
the sinks would have to be put in place months before the beginning of the hurricane season in late spring , and retrieved just before the major storms arrive - but by then their job should be done			0
' it may take thousands of these to protect @entity25 ’s @entity117 ( for example ) but we estimate the cost would be much lower than the damage caused by one of these storms , ' @entity16 says on its website			0
professor @entity11 added that he estimates 150 - 450 of the structures would be needed to suppress the formation of deadly hurricanes			1
' they would drift around and send out radar signals so that no one would collide with them , ' he told the @entity100			0
' @entity132 ' is a strip within the @entity75 where sea surface temperatures reach 28 ° @entity134 ) or higher in late spring and summer ( shown in orange for may 2003 )			0
the region that fuels tropical storms and hurricanes shifts annually but always stretches from east @entity140 to the @entity28 and the @entity141 professor @entity11 first came up with the idea after seeing the damage and suffering caused in @entity144 by @entity145 and first presented it to the @entity25 government in 2007			1
the @entity25 is prioritising research into hurricane suppression , with seven of the 10 deadliest hurricanes to hit that country having struck since 2004			0
at the latest estimates , @entity2 has caused a total of $ 30billion ( £ 19billion ) , with the economic costs of hurricanes in the @entity25 and @entity28 since 2002 clocking in at a phenomenal $ 200billion ( £ 125billion )			0
professor @entity11 claims the mechanics of his technology has been proven , but says research funding is urgently needed to investigate the ecological effects it might have			2
although he has written to the @entity6 government 's chief scientific officer , @entity6 officials have previously shied away from funding research into his marine technologies			0
in 1982 he invented the idea of a mechanical device that could bob up and down on the ocean generating electricity , but the government subsequently shut the @entity6 @entity172 programme claiming it was too expensive			0
it later emerged that civil servants from the energy department 's nuclear power division had ' miscalculated ' by a factor of 10 the cost of energy production from professor @entity11 's device			1
it has been claimed that decision may have set back @entity6 wave energy research by 20 years .			0

professor @entity11 's invention would cool the ocean 's surface to stop deadly hurricanes from forming
structures built from used car tyres would form wave - powered pumps that would mix the warm surface waters with cooler waters below
