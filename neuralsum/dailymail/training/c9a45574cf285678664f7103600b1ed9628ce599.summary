why was anyone surprised ? @entity1 ended talk of a scoring drought by netting his 58th @entity5 goal for @entity6 in 58 games for the club to help @entity6 to a 2 - 0 win over @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
it was the 12th consecutive away game in the @entity5 that @entity1 had scored in and he set up @entity13 in the second half to put the game beyond the @entity16			1
@entity1 had not scored in his last three games			2
he had n’t gone four games without scoring for four years but he rose to head past @entity10 ’s 19 - year - old keeper @entity20 to put @entity6 in - front in the first half			1
@entity1 scored his 58th @entity5 goal for @entity6 as his side earned a 2 - 0 win against @entity10 the @entity25 forward finds himself unmarked in the @entity10 penalty area before heading past goalkeeper @entity20 @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 watch as @entity1 's header floats towards the back of @entity20 's net @entity6 's @entity33 ended his mini goal drought which lasted just four hours and 59 minutes @entity35 looks an as @entity1 leaps into his trademark celebration in front of the @entity10 faithful @entity1 's first half header was his 58th goal in 58 @entity5 games for the @entity43 side @entity10 : @entity20 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 56 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 81 ) , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 32 ) subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 booked : @entity53 , @entity49 , @entity50 @entity6 : @entity62 , @entity13 , @entity27 , @entity63 , @entity35 ( @entity64 81 ) , @entity65 , @entity28 , @entity66 ( @entity67 84 ) , @entity29 , @entity68 ( @entity69 78 ) , @entity1 subs not used : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 booked : @entity28 goals : @entity1 25 , @entity13 78 the holders were not happy about being forced to wear pink – the last time they played in their garish third kit they lost 4 - 2 to @entity81 and had wanted to play in their all - black second strip only for @entity84 to deem it clashed with @entity10 's blue and white			1
they need n’t have worried – this was more ' back to the fuschia ' than the ' shocking in pink ' display they delivered in @entity90 in august			0
the did make a nervous start however with @entity28 , @entity94 referee @entity93 ’s first booking and @entity65 – the 22 - year - old @entity95 making his debut in midfield – almost following him with a foul on the edge of the area that @entity101 - @entity55 smashed into the wall			0
@entity10 were soaking up @entity6 pressure and creating chances themselves with @entity105 blasting over after finding more time and space than @entity108 would have been happy with down the @entity6 right			2
the left wing - back also caught @entity1 and left him temporarily hobbling but the @entity25 got back into his stride and put @entity6 in front			1
right back @entity35 got forward down the right and sent a hanging cross to the edge of the @entity10 six - yard - box			2
the @entity16 had three central defenders on the pitch but none of them tracked @entity1 who climbed to nod past @entity20			0
@entity68 could have made it two from @entity120 ’ pass but was denied by the teenage goalkeeper but things were now going downhill fast for @entity10			0
@entity55 limped off after a shin - pad to shin - pad crunch with @entity63 and @entity53 was booked meaning he will miss the second leg next month			0
the @entity6 players join @entity1 in celebration of the away side 's opening goal in @entity132 @entity44 was inches away from pulling @entity10 back into the game , but his sweet strike smashed against the crossbar @entity44 reacts after seeing his fierce strike cannon off the crossbar before eventually falling into @entity62 ' arms @entity95 defender @entity13 fires the visitors into a commanding 2 - 0 lead with a memorable strike in @entity16 the 26 - year - old is closed down by @entity45 but the defender 's efforts came too late to stop @entity13 's shot @entity13 darts towards @entity6 boss @entity108 in celebration of his stunning solo effort @entity1 very nearly doubled his tally but @entity20 saved well from a fiercely struck free - kick and although @entity108 could be seen urging @entity68 to track back he must have been happy with a first half performance that ended with @entity29 getting into the game with a jinking run down the @entity6 right			1
this was never going to be the 6 - 1 victory that @entity6 chalked up last season with @entity29 , @entity68 and @entity1 all scoring twice last season but the @entity158 champions were in control			1
@entity66 released @entity1 at the start of the second half and he almost found @entity68 as @entity6 looked to kill the game off			2
@entity29 then crossed from the right but @entity20 gathered comfortably			0
@entity10 looked short of ideas and not too upset with a 1 - 0 first leg reverse			1
@entity6 knew another goal would all but put them through			2
@entity29 was not helping them in that cause failing to pick out @entity1 in one counter-attack			0
there was a supportive round of applause from the @entity25 when @entity29 ’s pass was played behind him			0
@entity1 was then almost gifted another free - header in the @entity10 area but @entity20 cut out the cross before it reached him unmarked at the back post			1
@entity66 was then flicked through by @entity29 but he sent his shot just over			0
the @entity6 stars surround the @entity95 full - back after his finish gave @entity6 their second away goal of the night @entity13 's second half goal gives @entity6 a comfortable 2 - 0 aggregate scoreline ahead of the second leg in march @entity10 striker @entity185 lasted just 32 minutes before before having to come off with an injury @entity1 fails to make contact with the ball as he looks to double @entity6 's lead with an overhead kick @entity28 ( 8 ) started the move for @entity6 before the ball was worked out to @entity35 ( 15 ) , who supplied a perfect cross for @entity1 @entity10 boss @entity11 was unable to lead his side to victory against the @entity5 holders a combination of @entity27 and @entity68 manage to block @entity105 's first half free - kick before @entity6 went ahead former @entity201 winger @entity29 races away from @entity48 as the reigning @entity158 champions look to keep possession @entity108 complains to the fourth official as @entity6 look to earn a crucial away win against @entity10 and @entity6 almost paid for the missed opportunities to double their lead when @entity56 rattled @entity62 ’ bar from @entity53 ’s cross after @entity13 had been caught in possession			1
that was a wake - up call for @entity6 to get the second in spectacular style			2
@entity1 dribbled his way infield from the @entity6 left and @entity13 ’s right - foot rocket nestled in the top corner to put the match and tie beyond @entity220 ’s team			1
the @entity95 raced away to celebrate with his coach @entity108			0
the @entity222 had been whistled by the mindless minority in @entity6 ’s last game but he remains on course to guide @entity6 in to the quarter - finals			0
they will have to improve to win the competition but they had comfortably enough to beat the fourth best team in the @entity229			0
@entity62 ’ 150th @entity5 appearance had been largely without incident and @entity1 had got back among the goals			2
the @entity234 ’s ‘ barren ’ spell is now behind him and @entity6 had even buried the curse of that pink kit			0
@entity16 international @entity28 sends @entity45 ( left ) flying before receiving a yellow card for the challenge @entity94 referee @entity93 brandishes a yellow card as @entity28 complains despite his late foul on @entity45 @entity53 will miss the second leg after picking up a yellow card during the last 16 clash @entity10 skipper @entity45 wrestles with @entity68 as the @entity245 forwards looks to earn possession for his team @entity1 seems to tell @entity93 to keep his eyes on the @entity10 players after a late challenge on the @entity6 star @entity65 ( centre ) looks to keep the ball away from @entity54 as @entity29 looks on during the early stages @entity10 fans display flags and throw confetti ahead of the @entity5 clash in @entity132			1
