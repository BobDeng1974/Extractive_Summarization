most people would run away if they saw a pile of soil and rubble creeping towards them as if it had a life of its own			2
but one @entity6 youtuber captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road , crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake			1
the eerie phenomenon is called an ' earthflow ' and is a rare type of landslide			1
a @entity6 youtuber has captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road ( pictured ) , crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake @entity26 kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the @entity29 of @entity6 , which is thought to have happened at around 1pm on april 1 , according to a blog post on the @entity32 ’s website			1
in the video , snow - covered soil can be seen sliding down the bank at the side of a road , which is thought to run between @entity38 and @entity39			2
the earthflow also blocked nearby railroad tracks and caused power outages , but no one was hurt			2
commenting on the post , a user called @entity45 said : ‘ the landslide looks like it may have come from a large coal mine area			2
' @entity26 kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the @entity29 of @entity6 ( shown by the red marker ) , which is thought to have happened at 1pm on april 1 an earthflow is a type of landslide			1
it 's a viscous flow of fine - grained materials , such as clay , sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity			1
as the earthflow moves down a slope , it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl - shaped depression behind			2
@entity67 usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate			1
they are usually triggered by heavy rainfall , so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water , it starts flowing downhill			0
the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from 0.11 to 12.4 mph ( 0.17 to 20 km / h )			1
as the earthflow gathers momentum , it can be seen crushing trees in its path , and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard in the video			1
the cameraman backs away as the material eerily creeps across the width of the road , where he was previously standing and it seems to spread along the bank at a walking pace			0

as the earthflow runs down a slope , it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl - shaped depression behind			2
it is slower than a mud flow , which can cover villages beneath mud in minutes			0
@entity67 usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate , - although this point can not be seen in the video			1
as the earthflow gathers momentum , it can be seen crushing trees in its path ( pictured ) and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid , as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked ( pictured ) in a matter of minutes research suggests that rockfall son @entity139 ( pictured ) are caused by warming temperatures climbers have long suspected that hotter summers trigger rockfalls on the slopes of @entity139 in the @entity145			1
now a study of 533 rockfalls reported by climbers or spotted on satellite images of the mountain since 2003 , has bolstered the opinion that climate change is making popular routes up @entity155 's highest mountain more treacherous			0
@entity157 of the @entity158 at @entity159 in the @entity145 , spotted a strong correlation between the number of rockfalls and air and rock temperatures on the slopes , @entity156 reported			0
he thinks that melting permafrost may be to blame , because it loosens rocks that were held in place with ice , causing them to fall			0
the expert revealed that 95 per cent of rockfalls around the mountain occur during between june and september - the hottest months of the year			0
most begin in areas 10,170ft ( 3,100 metres ) above sea level , close to the zone containing perma ice , he told the @entity179 's general assembly in @entity180			0
as the @entity145 get hotter , the zone is thought to be receding , creating more rockfalls than before			0
they are usually triggered by heavy rainfall , so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water , it starts flowing downhill			0
the video shows a stream of water running down the road as the debris falls down the slope , indicating the mass of soil is waterlogged			1
the speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope , varying from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid , as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked in a matter of minutes			1
experts at @entity206 said speeds can range from 0.11 to 12.4 mph ( 0.17 to 20 km / h )			0
in fact , it can take minutes or years for material to move down slops and earthflows can affect anything from a few metres of land , to several hectares			0
in the video , the flow of debris is quite fast and it ’s possible to see industrial equipment toppled at the top of the slope , while trees are crushed beneath the moving earth and what appear to be power lines and pylons pulled down and dragged along by the moving mass of earth			1
the movement seems to speed up as the cameraman beats a hasty retreat down the road			0
when he pans back along the way he has come , the road is completely blocked by a debris that looks as if it is between one and two storeys high in places			0
towards the end of the footage , the speed of the earthflow seems to decline , but it continues to creep across the road , to completely cross it .			2

eerie earthflow was captured in the @entity29 of @entity6
it left a wide path of destruction , toppling pylons and crushing trees
@entity67 can vary in speed from barely detectable to 12 mph ( *20km/h* )
they are a form of landslide where fine soil or sand becomes waterlogged
