trailing @entity1 by two goals , @entity0 were down to fourth in the @entity3 at one stage in the afternoon but a thrilling four - goal turnaround moved them back to the top			1
‘ that ’s the madness of it , ’ manager @entity7 said in the aftermath			2
‘ i could n't believe in one game we dropped to fourth			0
it ’s great for the neutral , but not so great for us			0
’ the south coast club had not conceded the first goal at @entity16 this campaign and have struggled to get anything from losing positions , but comebacks rarely come better than being two behind after 21 minutes			0

but @entity0 have been this season ’s pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line			2
it did not feel like that , however , when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes			0
a straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by @entity60 , on 18 minutes , and @entity64 burst through on goal			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity32 started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in			2
‘ we want eight , ’ the travelling @entity1 supporters chanted in jest , demanding vengeance for @entity0 thrashing them 8 - 0 in the reverse of this fixture back in october			1

@entity1 winger @entity59 made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner			1
‘ that did n’t feel too good , ’ @entity7 admitted			0

only three minutes into the second half and they were in front			0
@entity42 broke free down the right , carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by @entity1 defender @entity55 after a cheeky turn			1
@entity154 stoked in the penalty			0
‘ i felt the officials were inconsistent , ’ @entity1 manager @entity73 said			2
' we had three clear onsides given off and @entity42 was level when he won the penalty			1
@entity35 tried to slap @entity65 in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing			0
’ if @entity1 ’s two goals in three minutes were impressive , @entity0 ’s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute			1
substitute @entity40 first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked , which left @entity52 on the floor , and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back			0
but there was nothing @entity52 could do when the ball came out to @entity21 who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar			2
the game was over in the 77th minute when @entity55 was sent off for a foul last man			0
referee @entity77 handed out a straight red card , but it was hard to make out amongst the @entity1 red faces			2
