by @entity0 for @entity1 a beauty therapist who went abroad for a bargain boob job was horrified when the implants burst through her skin just days later , nearly killing her			1
@entity6 , 30 , had been recommended the cosmetic surgeon in @entity8 by a friend and was initially delighted with her new figure			1
but just days after returning home , her size @entity12 breasts started leaking a brown discharge and suddenly burst			2
the mother - of - two said her confidence was at an all - time low because her breasts were sagging and different sizes , with one a b cup and one a c after being rushed to hospital , surgeons warned the mother - of - two she would die if the implants were not removed immediately			1
‘ i remember feeling scared then angry when i was told my implants would have to be taken out - but i had no choice , ' says ms @entity6 , from @entity32			1
' i had wanted bigger boobs for almost a decade because they had really sagged after having children			2
my confidence was rock bottom			0
' while one breast was a @entity40 cup , the was other a @entity41 - and both began to droop following the birth of her daughter , @entity44 , at 17			2
‘ working in the beauty industry it was important to me to look good and feel confident , though i had n’t for a very long time , ’ said ms @entity6			2
‘ i would look in the mirror and feel so self - conscious about that part of my body			2
i wished my breasts could be bigger			2
’ but as a single mother , she could n't afford expensive cosmetic surgery			1
' it got to the point where my appearance was affecting how i felt at work , though			0
as a beauty therapist it was critical i looked and felt good , but my clothes hung on me like a sack of potatoes			0
’ then in july 2008 a friend who ’d had liposuction at a cosmetic surgery in @entity8 recommended the clinic to ms @entity6			1
after researching the clinic online , she discovered she could have a breast uplift and implants for £ 2,300 – a third of the cost she would pay in the @entity74			1
friends and family also backed her decision to go abroad , so she took out a loan for £ 4,000 to cover flights and expenses			1
video courtesy of @entity82 she was also unhappy with her uneven breasts ( left ) and hoped surgery would sort the problem out			2
but even a week after surgery in @entity8 , she was in agonising pain ( right ) ' a year later as i got on the plane to @entity8 , i was so excited about having the body i 'd always dreamed of , ' she said			1
after five days exploring the city , ms @entity6 met the surgeon who would perform her procedure			1
she said : ' the receptionist at the clinic explained the surgeon did n’t speak much @entity97 , so i should show him photos of what i wanted			1
‘ but i assured myself he knew what he was doing and i showed him some magazine clippings of celebs with size @entity12 breasts , like i wanted			0
’ however on waking up two hours after the op , she was in total agony			0
' my breasts were bandaged up so i could n’t seem them and there was pain shooting through my chest			2
' i told my friend i thought i was going to die			0
’ the next day , her bandages were changed again before she was discharged - still without having seen her new breasts			2
surgeons told ms @entity6 her implants were too big			1
this had ripped open the skin around them , which had become infected even as she boarded the plane home the day after , her breasts continued to ache and she took some tablets the surgery had given her to ease her suffering			1
' i figured i should expect some pain following surgery , so i did my best not to worry , ' she said			2
back home , she spent the following few days slumped on the sofa , barely able to move her arms for the pain			0
but a week later , despite still being bandaged up , she decided she was ready to visit the salon where she worked to show her mother and colleagues her new breasts			1
as she lifted her top however , she noticed her bra was damp and a brown , smelly discharge was leaking from her left breast			1
‘ my mum said she could see my implant poking out of a 50p sized hole in my skin , which had burst open			0
’ after being rushed to @entity146 in @entity147 , a surgeon examined her breast			2
as he did , the skin under her right breast split too			0
‘ he said my implants were too big and they ’d ripped open the skin around them , which had become infected			1
' they had to be removed or i would die			0
' he added she was the fourth person he 'd seen that week who 's been the victim of botched cosmetic surgery abroad			1
later that day ms @entity6 was taken in to theatre to have her implants removed and she spent the next week having the infection washed out of them			1
' i spent two weeks in hospital and regretted going overseas so much , ' she said			0
' it really had n’t been worth it			0
’ even after being discharged , ms @entity6 had to return every two weeks for the next year so that nurses could clean her wounds and check her breasts were healing			1
but nothing can repair her confidence , which is now even lower , having been left with small breasts and horrific scarring			0
she said : ‘ my breasts looked even worse than before and i worried even if i got new implants , the skin under them would always look like i ’d been burnt			1
‘ at least the uplift i ’d received overseas had n’t gone wrong , so my breasts looked alright when i wore strappy tops			0
‘ but i continued to miss the fullness my new breasts had given me and my confidence , at work and going out with friends , and i felt at an all - time low			0
’ she was told she would have to wait at least two years - and until she ’d made a full recovery - before she could have further surgery			0
though it would cost her thousands - and she was still paying off her loan for her original surgery , ms @entity6 said she could n't stay the way she was			1
then in may 2013 , she spotted a magazine ad recruiting people for a documentary about botched cosmetic surgery called botched up bodies			1
in return they ’d receive free corrective surgery			0
last year ms @entity6 underwent further surgery in the @entity74 to correct the damage and enlarge her breasts again she said : ' having this surgery changed my life			1
i ’m more confident now and love receiving compliments			0
i just wish i had n't risked my life the first time for cheap cosmetic surgery ' ms @entity6 said : ‘ i was anxious about appearing on tv but my mum encouraged me and i decided it was worth it to get the body i wanted			1
’ at @entity218 , in @entity219 , a leading cosmetic surgeon dr @entity216 , from @entity217 , examined her and recommended an e cup			1
on the day of her surgery last june she admits feeling nervous			0
' but when i came round hours later - not in any pain and with new 34e breasts - she was thrilled			2
then in november , she had a second procedure to remove the scar tissue she ’d lived with for three years			0
she said : ‘ having this surgery changed my life			0
i ’m more confident now and love receiving compliments			0
‘ i wish i had n’t been so eager before to have cosmetic surgery			0
i should have researched my options and saved up to have it done in the @entity74			0
‘ instead , going abroad almost cost me my life			0
it ’s not worth risking it for cheap cosmetic surgery			0
