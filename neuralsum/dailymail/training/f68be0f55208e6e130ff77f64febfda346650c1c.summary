scientists have begun to understand the structure of the virus ’s ‘ envelope ’ which helps it enter human cells			1
the researchers say the breakthrough is of great value for medical science			0
a vaccine which could prevent hiv infection ( pictured ) is on the horizon , new research suggests the finding provides the most detailed picture yet of the @entity21 - causing virus ’s complex structure - including parts of the virus that future jabs could mimic to elicit an immune response			1
about 34 million people are infected with @entity15 and although drugs are used to manage many cases , there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections			1
none of the @entity15 vaccines tested so far have come close to providing adequate protection against the virus			2
about 34 million people are infected with @entity15 and although drugs are used to manage many cases , there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections this is because of the challenges posed by the ‘ envelope ’ protein , which is called @entity42 @entity42 ’s structure is so complex and delicate scientists have found it difficult to get the protein into a form that is suitable for the imaging technique necessary to study it			1
professor @entity50 , of the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , explained : ‘ it tends to fall apart , for example , even when it ’s on the surface of the virus , so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable			0
’ in the study , researchers created a version of @entity42 that has the stability and other properties needed for successful imaging , but that retains virtually all the structures found on @entity42 using cutting - edge imaging methods they were then able to study the new @entity42 in minute detail			0
the study was the first ever of @entity42 , and revealed the envelope ’s structure in finer detail than has been reported before			2
the study for @entity74 revealed how @entity42 assembles and undergoes shape changes during infection , and showed how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses - such as flu and @entity80			0
professor @entity81 , of @entity51 , said : ‘ most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits - but we ’ve needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted , for example with a vaccine			2

scientists have begun to understand the structure of @entity15 *'s* ' envelope '
the ' envelope ' is what allows the virus to enter human cells
understanding it will allow scientists to *identify* parts of the virus that could be mimicked by a vaccine to elicit an immune response
