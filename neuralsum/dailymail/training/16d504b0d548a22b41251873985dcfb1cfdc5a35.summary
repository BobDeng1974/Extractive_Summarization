she is , without a shadow of doubt , the most famous ghost at one of @entity5 ’s most haunted sites			1
but does this murky photograph show the fabled @entity7 of @entity8 or something less spooky ? the image was taken by @entity11 , 28 , on her smartphone during a visit to the castle – which dates back to 1071 – with her husband @entity15 , 33 , and their three children			1
it was only when they were back home in @entity21 that mrs @entity11 took a closer look			1
suddenly , she saw a hazy image of a woman in grey standing inside the arch. ‘ it is really creepy , ’ said mrs @entity11			1
‘ @entity15 had heard about the ghost of the @entity7 and we think it must be her			1
’ the photo sparked speculation on social media that it was either the result of clever editing or had been achieved by using a special app that can implant ghoulish figures into images			0
but mrs @entity11 denied the suggestion , insisting : ‘ to be honest i would n’t have a clue where to start			1
’ @entity60 , lead investigator at the @entity61 , who call themselves the @entity5 ’s leading ghosthunters , said the figure is ‘ too vague and grainy ’ to be a hoax			0
he believes the image may be the result of ‘ matrixing ’ , a term increasingly used among paranormal investigators to describe the human mind ’s natural tendency to find something familiar in complex shapes or colours			1
this can cause the brain to think it can see a specific person			0
@entity11 , pictured with her children @entity81 , nine , @entity82 , six and @entity83 , four , captured the chilling image on her mobile phone on a day trip to @entity8 mr @entity87 , whose team has appeared in television shows in the @entity5 , @entity90 and @entity91 , said that in the case of the @entity7 , the shadows and light in the arch , combined with knowledge of the ghost ’s fable , make us see what we want to see			1
@entity101 may also help explain why people think they can see faces or symbols , for example , in clouds or burnt into a piece of toast			0
but mr @entity87 said there could also be the far simpler explanation for the @entity7 ’s appearance – that someone happened to be standing in the shadows when the photo was taken			1
whatever the explanation , the photograph , which was taken in august , is only now creating a stir among ghosthunters – just in time for the @entity119 season			0
@entity8 is located at @entity120 near @entity8 in the @entity28			1
historians date the ruined castle back to the @entity123 of 1066 and it is thought one of the @entity126 's followers @entity127 built the first castle there around 1070			2
his son @entity129 owned the castle when it was recorded at the time of the @entity132 of 1086			2
the earliest castle would have been made of wood and no longer exists			2
over the centuries , the stone castle was assembled and extended			2
hundreds of years later it would become a @entity139 stronghold during rhe @entity140 and was besieged twice but before its surrender to @entity144 's forces in 1646			0
tourist attraction : historians date the ruined castle back to the @entity123 of 1066 the castle was eventually surrendered in may 1646 and parliament ordered that it be partly demolished			2
the present ruined appearance of the keep results from this decision			0
the bullk of the remaining habitable parts of the castle was destroyed by fire in 1750			0
but by the nineteenth century , the site found a new use as a ' @entity159 ' and parts of the site were revamped			0
in the nineteenth and early twentieth century the site was used for large events and pageants and in 1937 , when the @entity167 was established , the castle grounds were incorporated into the zoo			0
