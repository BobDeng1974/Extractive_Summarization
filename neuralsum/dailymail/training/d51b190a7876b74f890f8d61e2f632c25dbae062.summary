with just weeks to go for many to claim their holiday entitlement , research has revealed that @entity4 workers allow 60 million days to go to waste - worth a staggering £ 5.37bn			1
for two in five of us , the holiday year runs from january to december , meaning time is running out to take that winter break			2
only half of all employees - falling to a third of those aged 18 - 24 - have claimed all the holiday due to them in their last full holiday year			2
almost half of the working population will lose an average of six days paid holiday a year forty - four per cent of the survey 's respondents were in full - time employment , thus qualifying for at least 28 days ' statutory leave per annum			1
they lost around six days ' paid leave , which is worth £ 542.40 based on the average weekly earnings of employees in @entity4			1
the same pattern is emerging for the current holiday year – with an average of over seven days still due to employees and little compensation if they can not take their full entitlement			1
only 10 per cent of respondents said that their employer has agreed to pay them in lieu of lost days			0
seventeen per cent said they are too busy at work to take time off and a further 16 per cent said that their employer makes it difficult for them to take their full entitlement			0
the problem becomes more marked for two in five workers ( 42 per cent ) whose holiday year runs from january to december			1
the survey found that those employees have an average of 5.5 days ' leave due to them before their entitlement runs out in less than two months ' time			0
one in five still have 10 or more days of holiday entitlement left			0
thirty - one per cent of people on a january - december holiday year plan to get away in december for many who intend not to lose their entitlement , booking a december trip away could be just the tonic - but again it 's best to do your research			1
@entity57 : @entity58 , @entity59 book between december 6 - 7 : £ 383.00 book between december 20 - 23 : £ 805.00 difference of 52 % @entity62 : @entity63 , @entity64 book between december 6 - 7 : £ 473.00 book between december 20 - 23 : £ 836.00 difference of 43 % @entity65 : @entity66 , @entity67 book between december 6 - 7 : £ 830.00 book between december 20 - 23 : £ 1,448.00 difference of 43 % @entity69 : @entity70 , @entity71 book between december 6 - 7 : £ 798.00 book between december 20 - 23 : £ 1,562.00 difference of 49 % cost comparison of a seven - night @entity75 flight - inclusive package for one with resort meals / drinks the @entity78 reveals that 31 per cent of those whose current holiday year ends in december plan to use some or all of their entitlement on holidays before then			1
although people with paid leave to take before the end of december set a generous average holiday budget of £ 638 per person – rising to £ 1,000 or more for one in five ( 22 per cent ) , separate @entity78 research found that people would be better off to travel early in december rather than over the festive season			1
a week away over @entity93 and @entity94 to four destinations rated among the cheapest in the @entity78 's recent @entity96 was found to cost 43 - 52 per cent more than it would earlier in the month			2
a seven - night @entity75 flight - inclusive package for one with resort meals / drinks to the four - star @entity58 at @entity59 , @entity57 would cost £ 383,000 departing december 6 - 7 , but would be £ 805 departing december 20 - 23 , a 52 per cent price hike			2
@entity104 of @entity78 said : ' the message for people who have only a short time left in which to use up this year 's holiday entitlement is clear : do your homework on the timing of your trip and pick a destination where package costs are reasonable and resort prices low to ensure you get the best possible value			0
' @entity118 is always a cheaper time to travel and our latest research has found that @entity57 and @entity62 are great value in @entity123 while those old favourites , @entity69 and @entity65 , are good choices further afield			0
' keep an eye on exchange rate movements to ensure you get the most travel cash for your pounds			0
calculate how much you are likely to spend while abroad and change enough cash to see you through , remembering that there are improved rates for higher value transactions			0

research shows £ 5.37bn of paid leave is *unclaimed* annually
holiday year for over two in five employees ends in december
31 per cent plan holidays before then and will spend an average of £ 638pp
travelling over @entity93 could cost twice as much as in early december
