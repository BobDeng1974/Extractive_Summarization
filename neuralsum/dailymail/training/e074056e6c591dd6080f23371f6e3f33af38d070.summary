by @entity0 last updated at 1:09 pm on 19th january 2012 parents of a 15 - year - old boy whose weight plummeted to just 4st 7lbs are blaming health lessons for triggering his life - threatening eating disorder			1
mr and mrs @entity7 , claim that @entity9 's battle with anorexia started aged seven , when he was taught about healthy eating at school			1
prior to the education programme he ate a balanced diet but they noticed that he got increasingly picky about food and would often skip meals			1
mr and mrs @entity7 claim that @entity19 's battle with anorexia started after he was taught about healthy eating at school and in october 2010 his family were forced to seek medical help when @entity9 's weight fell below 5st and he had a body mass index ( @entity27 ) of just 14 - anything below 18.5 is deemed underweight			1
doctors diagnosed him with anorexia and warned him if he did n't change his eating habits he would end up hospitalised			1
explaining her son 's gradual weight loss @entity7 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ' he took part in an exercise in which pupils had to talk about the food they ate at home			1
they were given a star if healthy meals and a cross for junk food			1
' at first we thought he was just picky and he would grow out of it , he would only eat lean ham , apples and cereal			2
' if i offered him a bag of crisps he ’d say they were bad for him			2
but we just thought it was a fad			0
' he was about 11 or 12 when we thought ‘ there ’s something not quite right ’			0
' @entity9 got increasingly picky about the foods he ate and would often skip meals @entity9 , who stands at 5ft 1in , started to report various health complications as his weight dropped			1
aching joints , anaemia and heart palpitations were just some of the symptoms he developed			0
fearing for his life , his parents were even checked that he was still breathing throughout the night			0
but the teenager insisted : ' i ’m just not interested in food			0
i do n’t want to eat but i think i look normal			0
' however his parents sought medical advice and @entity9 finally admitted he was suffering from an eating disorder			1
doctors told him to put on 1lb in two weeks and warned him of the various health implications that could ensue if he did n't change his ways			0
after increasing his food intake and consulting a dietician @entity9 now weighs 5st 9lbs and has a @entity27 of about 15.8			1
although his health has since improved , his parents say it is an ' endless cycle ' and worry his weight could drop again at anytime			2
@entity9 , who is studying at @entity83 , has high hopes of going to university , becoming a games designer and working in @entity87			0
but his parents fear he may never move from their family home , as he refuses to leave the house when he is not at college and does not socialise with other teenagers			0
mr and mrs @entity7 attended a walking on eggshells course , which gave them a better understanding of eating @entity97 discovered @entity9 has a restricted selective eating disorder			2
mr @entity99 added : ' i used to tell @entity9 that he needed to eat and i would get quite irate			1
' i also said to him he was looking well when he put some weight on , but we have learnt not to do that			2
' he does n’t go out , he has friends at college but he does n’t see them out of the classroom and he only speaks to friends online			0
' the family have been helped by @entity109 for people with @entity112 group , also known as seed			0
they have now called for more understanding of anorexia in boys			0
