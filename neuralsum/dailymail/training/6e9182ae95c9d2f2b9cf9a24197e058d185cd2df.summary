an @entity1 man has confessed to shooting dead two @entity3 soldiers who were training him as a police officer in an attack which took place three years ago			1
in a chilling and candid account , the unidentified man said he had waited until sergeant @entity9 and private first class @entity10 had taken off their body armour before calmly gunning them down in @entity15 , central @entity1			1
his confession comes just a day after four @entity3 soldiers were gunned down by @entity1 police at a checkpoint in a similar incident			1
the latest in a spate of so - called green - on - blue attacks			1
speaking from inside a @entity34 controlled village the man said : ' the @entity3 went inside the nearby school for a break			1
while the number of soldiers being killed or injured by roadside bombs is falling there have been a growing number of incidents involving @entity1 police or soldiers opening fire on coalition troops			1
so far this year at least 51 servicemen have been killed in so - called ' green on blue ' attacks compared to a total of 35 last year			1
while the @entity34 are often quick to claim responsibility for the killings , intelligence sources believe most are actually carried out by ' lone - wolves ' who have personal grievances against foreign troops			1
@entity3 col @entity70 said : ' the @entity34 lie and we know they lie we think they overstate their influence on their tragic incidents			2
' we think somewhere around 25 per cent are insurgent related to some degree			0
' the attacks are referred to as green - on - blue due to the colour of the coalition uniforms used by @entity3 and @entity40 troops and the blue outfits worn by the @entity84			1
chief spokesman for @entity87 's @entity86 , brig - gen @entity88 said : ' what we identified was that most of them were caused by personal grievances and stress situations			2
' those isolated incidents do n't reflect the overall security situation in @entity1			2
' as we speak 500,000 soldiers and policemen are working together to contribute to a more secure and stable @entity1			2
' ' they took off their body armour and put their weapons down			0
at that moment , i thought it was the right time so i took my gun and shot them			0
' admitting to the 2009 incident that left the two soldiers dead and three others injured , the man told @entity38 that he did so because he took issue with the way that @entity3 were treating his people			1
he said that he decided to kill the two men on october 2 ' because @entity3 were oppressing people in my country			2
they were burning copies of the @entity115 and disrespecting it '			0
shortly after the attack , the unidentified @entity1 man , who is a father of two , says that he was captured by the @entity34			1
after he told his captors that he had killed @entity3 , the @entity34 took him to @entity36 where he was ' welcomed very warmly like a hero '			1
the man is now back in @entity1 after his @entity34 captors decided that it was safe enough for him to return			1
' they said @entity3 were not everywhere like they used to be			2
the @entity34 had brought security and i should return home , ' he said			0
so far in 2012 , @entity87 reported that there had already been 51 coalition deaths because of so - called green - on - blue attacks , and as a result the @entity27 training scheme would be paused temporarily while the admission criteria were re-evaluated to weed out possible attackers			1
the unidentified @entity1 solider seems confident that the attacks will continue because the hatred is still there			2
' i know they will increase , i know more people will do what i did , ' he said			0
those words are even more provocative in the wake of this weekend 's killings			0
four @entity3 soldiers were killed on sunday in @entity144 , and their identities have not been released			1

' all of our thoughts are with the families of sergeant @entity147 and private @entity148			0
they gave their lives protecting @entity40 's national security , helping to make sure that @entity1 never again becomes a haven for international terrorism			2
' @entity177 , who had completed tours of duty in @entity180 and @entity181 , was nicknamed bull because of his strength and confidence			0

his company commander , @entity218 , said : ' his confidence , sense of humour and ever present smile made him hugely popular and fun to be with			0
' the @entity223 said the deaths were unrelated to the attack at @entity198 which killed two @entity197			0
those attackers had automatic rifles , rocket - propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests			0
besides destroying six @entity231 jets , they demolished three refuelling stations and damaged six aircraft hangars			0
the @entity34 claimed responsibility for that attack , saying it wanted to avenge @entity236 insulted by an amateurish film that mocked the @entity238 - and because prince @entity239 is on the base			2
the prince , who turned 28 on saturday , is set to start flying @entity242 missions this week , and his deployment is not planned to be shortened after the attack			0
this is his second tour in @entity1			0
