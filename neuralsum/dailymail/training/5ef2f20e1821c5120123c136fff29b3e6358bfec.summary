the sum it sold for is considerably higher than the £ 25,000 asking price , but estate agents say this rundown 34ft by 17ft stone - walled hut which overlooks @entity18 on the @entity19 in @entity20 could be the bargain of the century			1

@entity70 , from @entity71 and @entity73 estate agents , which handled the sale , said : ' the property was always used as a fishing store			0
' the owners spoke to the local council about 10 years ago and they had a letter from them stating they would consider the property for conversion			1
' because of that prospect , the guide price of £ 25,000 and its location , it was well worth somebody taking a punt on it			2
' if the new owner does get planning permission to convert it , it would be a wonderful opportunity for them			0
