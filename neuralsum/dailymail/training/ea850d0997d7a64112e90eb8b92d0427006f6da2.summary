by @entity0 workers have begun a last - ditch attempt to save a notorious 10,000 - year - old route on top of one of the country 's highest summits			1
striding edge is a dangerous knife - edged path on @entity11 , in the @entity12 , but years of erosion along the route is damaging wildlife			1
now more than 100 tonnes of stone are being shipped to the path , via helicopter , to try to restore its surface			1
in the @entity12 , walkers were treated to a dramatic sight as a helicopter , pictured , was drafted in to save an eroding mountain ridge			1
striding edge , on the approach to @entity11 is a challenging ridge , know as an arete , created by two glaciers a total of 136 helicopter trips and three months of intense work will attempt to hide the easier paths created by the hundreds - of - thousands of climbers that visit each year			1
@entity36 is the ranger for @entity38 , the team carrying out the work , and is adamant work needs to be done as soon as possible			2
it is one of @entity44 's few mountanious regions - all land in @entity44 above 3,000ft ( 910 metres ) lies in the @entity12			1
the highest peak is @entity47 at 3,209ft ( 978 metres ) - the tallest mountain in @entity44			2
it belongs to a rock group called @entity51 , which is resistant to weathering and dates back 500 million years			0
many features in the @entity12 are the result of glaciation , which ended 15,000 years ago			1
the large ' u-shaped ' valleys were formed by retreating glaciers			0
he said : ' people have created new paths when trying to avoid the original route along @entity62 and this has caused erosion			2
' the soil is being washed into [ the lake ] @entity67 , and changing the acidic levels in the water			0
' species of @entity72 fish there need the right conditions to lay their eggs			0
' it is n't just about the wildlife though			0
we are trying to make the route look natural again			2
' it is a sensitive sight and people will think it should be left alone			0
but we are doing this to conserve the landscape			0
' we are successful if you ca n't tell we have been there when our work is finished			0
' there can be up to 2,000 climbers on the route at any one time , and it is only in the last 30 to 40 years that the eroded land has become a problem			0
@entity94 , program manager for @entity95 , led by the @entity96 , added : ' the rocks are being delivered so people do n't see other paths that have emerged , and do n't use them again			0
' we will be putting information boards highlighting the dangers on @entity103 for climbers unfamiliar of the challenge			1
' the route is popular with walkers taking on the 3,100ft ( 950 metres ) summit of @entity11 , but over the years erosion has caused problems			1
@entity111 and a helicopter , pictured , were drafted in to transport 135 bags of stone , weighing 188 stone ( 750kg ) each up to the mountain ridge to disguise the easier routes the scenery of the @entity12 was created largely by glacial movements of the last ice age between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago and the volcanic eruptions that preceded it			1
the stones ( pictured ) should help to preserve the area from further erosion striding edge ( pictured ) is part of the @entity11 mountain in the @entity12			2
the mountain is 3,117 feet ( 950 metres ) above sea level and is the third highest peak in @entity44			0
striding edge is a popular scrambling route that stretches for over a mile ( 1.6 kilometres ) to the @entity11 summit plateau			2

work is *underway* to save a path from destruction in the @entity12
known as @entity103 , the knife - edged path is popular with walkers
but continued visitors have seen it erode a dangerous amount
now with the help of a helicopter , workers are *hoping* to save the route
100 tonnes of stone are being shipped to restore the 10,000 - year - old path
