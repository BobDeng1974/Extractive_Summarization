when you get to my age you ca n’t just ‘ go ’ on holiday			1
oh no. such things require serious preparation , both mental and physical			1
entire invasions have been orchestrated in less time than it takes me to get my legs to the point where i will risk exposing them			1
as for my upper arms and stomach , they have n’t seen daylight since the old queen died			1
the rest ? well , it needs to be thoroughly buffed , polished , sculpted , pummelled , tinted and tweaked until i can get it to the stage where i ’m confident i wo n’t frighten small children			1
when you get to my age you ca n't just ' go ' on holiday			1
oh no. such things require serious preparation , both mental and physical			1
first , hair - removal			1
i was recently sent an odd little depilatory gadget , which , in the way of these things , sat on my desk for several weeks , eliciting various not terribly funny comments from male colleagues			2
eventually i took it home to try , if only to put an end to the jokes			2
turns out it ’s rather brilliant			2
it ’s called @entity39 and it basically singes off unwanted hairs			2
if that sounds dangerous , do n’t worry , i tried it and managed not to set off the smoke alarm			2
it ’s very good for legs and can also be used on the bikini line — if you ’re terribly brave			1
one of the paradoxes about getting older is that your thighs look much nicer if they ’re tanned , yet getting them tanned is quite impossible because they ’re all wobbly and covered in thread veins			1
@entity55 , £ 8 ( www.sainsburys.com )			2
coffee granules and coconut oil stimulate skin to leave it smooth , soft and ready to tan			1
either you can have your leg veins removed through sclerotherapy , which can be very effective ( although success rates vary from patient to patient ) but needs to be done during the winter months ( it ’s one of those procedures that make the problem look much worse before it gets better ) ; or you can banish the husband and the kids for a couple of hours and turn yourself into @entity71 using the power of self - tan			1
in my experience , the success or failure of self - tan depends entirely on the amount of preparation			1
it is not a process that can be hurried			2
here ’s what you will need : some plastic gloves ( @entity87 all - purpose will do fine ) and a tanning mitt ( the mitt is not essential but the gloves are ) , a good exfoliator , a normal moisturiser , a full - length mirror , a pair of soft black trousers , a loose black top , an old towel and a glass of wine			2
oh , and some self - tan , of course			1
run a bath , soak for 15 minutes			2
then exfoliate , exfoliate , exfoliate , paying special attention to knees , elbows , heels and any other dry or scaly area			2
then do it all again			2
once out of the bath , slather yourself in moisturiser , again paying extra attention to knees , elbows , etc. drink your wine			0
now , pull on your gloves			0
just a reminder now : you are naked in front of the mirror ( that ’s what the wine was for ) , so you might want to lock the door			0
starting at your feet , work the self - tan into your skin in upward motions , making sure you do n’t miss any bits			1
for this reason it ’s best to use a product that darkens the skin visibly — it seems messier but the end result will look much more professional			0
work fast — most modern self - tans are designed to dry quickly			0
check your progress in the mirror and go over any white patches			0
do your arms last and , when you ’ve finished , take off the gloves and brush the excess onto your hands			0
best not to do your hands per se — they do n’t really need it , and it ’s easy to stain nails and cuticles			0
once you ’re dry , get dressed in your black ensemble			0
no underwear , please , and no shoes			0
after a while you will start smelling of biscuits ( this is the active ingredient in the tan working )			1
stick with it for as long as you can bear the smell , then shower off and moisturise			1
having taken the edge off your pallor , it ’s easy now just to add a tiny bit of fake tan to your ordinary body cream and use every day to build a proper beach - fabulous colour			1
to this end the genius that is @entity166 has just brought out @entity168 ( £ 18 ) : just a couple of drops in your everyday body cream will turn it into a gradual tanning product			0
the @entity173 and @entity174 arrive with @entity175 at @entity176 on the first day of their official to @entity178 let ’s be clear : if i had to step off an aeroplane after a 27 - hour flight with a baby , i would emphatically not look like the @entity174			1
i mean , look at those thighs			0
it ’s not right.for those of us who are not elfin - limbed princesses , air travel is not always a good look			0
dehydration , lack of movement , dryness , chair static , hair frizz , wind - inducing airline food : it ’s not an ideal combination			0
the longer the flight , the worse the bloat			1
@entity203 ’s @entity202 , £ 19.50 at @entity204 ( it ’s designed for pregnant ladies but i ’m not proud ) contains lots of lovely refreshing , de-puffing ingredients such as ginger and peppermint , and it comes in a 100ml bottle so it should just about squeak past security — provided , of course , you put it in the requisite see - through receptacle			0
if you ’re a regular traveller , you might want to consider investing in your own see - through make - up bag			0
at the top end of the scale there ’s @entity224 ’s incredibly extravagant but completely delectable @entity223 ( £ 150 , www.anyahindmarch.co.uk ) , which is brilliantly well thought - out with separate compartments for take - off and landing			0
otherwise dear old @entity228 does a very nice set of three with a snazzy polka - dot trim ( £ 7.99 , www.marksandspencer.com )			0
one of my favourite brands , this works , has done an entire range of clever in - flight essentials , including in @entity236 ( £ 18 ) , which comes in a handy roll - on and contains a reviving blend of essential oils including marjoram , black pepper and pain - relieving clove			1
great also post-gym , if you happen to be that way inclined			0
i find my skin shrivels up like a prune at the barest hint of a doors - to - manual , so a moisturiser is a must			0
@entity249 ( £ 4.95 from www.pawpawshop.co.uk ) is a fantastic all - rounder , suitable for skin , lips , nails , dry patches and the like			0
it ’s a very pure product based on papaya extract : simple but effective			0
lastly , something to keep the in - flight hair frizzies at bay : @entity262 ( £ 6.29 at @entity263 ) : the original and still the best .			1
