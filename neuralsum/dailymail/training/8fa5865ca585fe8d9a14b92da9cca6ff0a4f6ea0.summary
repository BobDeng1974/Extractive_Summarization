@entity1 boss @entity0 is confident @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 will sign a new contract at the @entity5			1
@entity2 has been back to his best this season and the club have been in negotiations over a new deal			2
the 27 - year - old 's current contract expires in the summer of 2016			1
@entity2 has been in very good form this season and is expected to sign a new contract at @entity1 city boss @entity0 is confident that @entity2 is happy at @entity1 and will extend his stay at the @entity5 @entity0 said : ' i think it 's an issue that we 're talking about			1
@entity2 knows what i think about that			2
i think in the right moment , ( we will ) have the right solution			0
i think @entity2 wants to stay here and we want him to stay			2
' if he re-signs , @entity2 would follow team - mates @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , who all agreed fresh terms in the summer			2
@entity0 dropped @entity2 for a spell last autumn after a series of high - profile errors			1
he responded well and finished the season strongly , helping @entity1 win the @entity37 and @entity36 after regaining his place			1
this season some of his performances have been top - drawer			0
he was outstanding in a @entity42 loss at @entity43 last month and was similarly impressive in last saturday 's 4 - 1 thrashing of @entity45			2
@entity2 makes a save in tuesday 's disappointing 2 - 2 draw against @entity48 in the @entity42 extra motivation might have come from the summer signing of @entity51 from @entity0 's former club @entity52 , but the manager puts the improvement down to @entity2 himself			1
@entity0 said : ' he is not responding to the challenge of @entity51			1
he is responding as number one goalkeeper as @entity3			0
except for the first three months of last year , @entity2 always puts in a very good performance			0
' despite @entity2 's brilliance , @entity1 's defence has not been impregnable this season and they have kept just two clean sheets out of eight in the @entity37			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 was left frustarted by his side 's 2 - 2 draw against @entity48 @entity0 acknowledges that but does not see it is an area needing specific attention and instead wants general improvement across the pitch			1
the @entity71 said : ' we are always trying to improve in all senses , in attack and in defence			0
' this season we are not so strong in attacking			0
last season in the first eight games i think we had scored more goals than now			0
@entity51 was brought in to challenge @entity2 for the goalkeeping position but @entity2 has responded well ' but also we had conceded more goals than now			1
this season our defence is ( joint ) second behind @entity84 as the best in the league			0
' by our defence i 'm not talking about only the back line , i 'm talking the whole team , and i think we 're defending well			0
but of course we must improve			0
there 's a lot of goals that we can avoid and it will be better for us			0
