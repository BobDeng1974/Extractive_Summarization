@entity0 plans to unveil a classic beverage nationwide this december that is a far cry from the sugary soda that made the brand famous			1
as @entity5 cut down on unhealthy soft drinks , @entity0 has turned to creating a premium type of milk to boost their dwindling profits			1
@entity10 will be available in stores in late december and boasts 50 per cent more protein and 50 per cent less sugar than regular milk			1
it also contains 30 per cent more calcium			0
the added nutritional benefits fatten the price tag and it will cost about double the amount of regular milk			1
new product : as less and less @entity5 are buying the sugary soda that @entity0 is famous for , the brand has decided to come out with a premium milk product called @entity10 coming soon : @entity10 milk will be on shelves starting in late december and will cost twice the price of regular milk because it is supposedly healthier than traditional milk @entity10 is also lactose free			1
' it 's basically the premiumization of milk , ' @entity31 , a senior vice president at @entity0 's @entity33 operation at the @entity34 last week			2
the company has had success in advertising healthier beverages with their simply juice line which has done well despite the fruit juice industry starting to slump			0

milk sales have also declined by 8 per cent over the last ten years			0
what @entity0 aims to do is advertise how @entity10 is healthier than traditional milk because it 's cold - filtered to concentrate protein and remove fat and sugar			1
@entity0 already sells a protein shake called @entity92 which goes through the same filtration process			2
in order to build hype around the new milk , @entity0 has developed provocative ads which they launched earlier this year in @entity99 of women wearing dresses made from milk , reports @entity103			2

despite the milk industry being on the decline , @entity0 believes that their premium product equipped with a premium price tag will reel in the cash flow			2
' now to be clear , we 're going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it wo n't rain money in the early couple of years , ' @entity31 said at last week 's conference			0
