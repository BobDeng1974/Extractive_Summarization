by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 21 october 2013 former vice president @entity1 has revealed that he had a signed resignation letter ready for much of his time in president @entity5 ’s administration in case he became incapacitated by a heart attack			1
@entity1 has had five heart attacks - including one during the month of @entity5 ’s first election - and felt that he had to prepare in case something happened while in office			1
during an interview on @entity14 , he said that one of his motivations in drawing up the unusual letter was because he looked back at the medical problems of @entity19 who had a stroke that incapacitated him but kept him in office due to the constraints of the @entity24			2
in spite of this awareness , @entity1 got defensive when questioned about whether or not his three prior heart attacks should have ruled him out from being elected vice president in the first place			1
‘ i did n't seek the job , the president came to me , the party nominated me , the doctors that consulted on it reached a conclusion , the people elected me , ’ he said during an interview with @entity51 on 60 minutes on sunday night			0
‘ at what basis do you want to override that decision making process ? do you want to have an offshoot where we come check with @entity51 and say “ @entity65 , is he up to the task ? ” that 's not the way it works			0
’ opening up : @entity1 is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist @entity51 went on to question a campaign doctor ’s report who gave @entity1 the all - clear , writing that at the time he had ‘ normal cardiac function ’ in spite of having had three heart attacks and having smoked three packs of cigarettes a day for more than two decades			1
‘ i 'm not responsible for that			0
i do n't know what took place between the doctors , ’ he said			0
‘ there 's no question i think based upon the fact that i did it for eight years that they were right			0
’ the 72 - year - old @entity88 is promoting a book he co-wrote alongside his cardiologist about the ways in which medical advancements have dramatically improved conditions for patients with heart disease like himself			2
way too big : because his heart was too big ( left ) , it made it harder for the organ to effectively pump blood throughout the body , and that problem was fixed with the new transplant organ unusual : this picture shows @entity1 's old heart immediately after it was removed , and it was noticeably bigger than it should be they also revealed that they debated putting in a defibrilltor to help regulate the then - vice president ’s blood flow , but they were concerned that a terrorist may be able to remotely gain control of the heart and kill him			1
the scheme seems outrageous , but it resonates now as it was used as a plotline in the hit television series @entity119 where a terrorist used that exact trick to kill the vice president			1
‘ i was aware of the dangers that existed , ’ @entity1 said when asked about the parallels between his life and the fictitious show			0
‘ i know from the experience we had and the necessity for adjusting my own device that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible			0
’ art imitating life : @entity1 's fears of a terror attack on a prospective defibrillator were played out in this episode of @entity119 where the vice president is killed by a terrorist remotely operating his heart mechanism during his 60 minutes appearance , @entity1 and his doctor @entity141 showed pictures of @entity1 ’s old heart that was replaced with a transplant in march of last year and the size of the old heart showed just how damaged it was			1
according to the doctor , a healthy heart is typically the size of two hands clamped together ; the heart that was removed from @entity1 ’s chest was half - a - foot wide			2
‘ it 's one of those situations where bigger is not necessarily better , ’ @entity1 joked			0

former vice president has had five heart attacks and a heart transplant
@entity1 is now promoting a book he wrote with his cardiologist
revealed that he feared he would be incapacitated in office and the @entity24 had no *parameters* to replace him so he wrote a letter removing him from office that could be used if he was unable to write
also said his doctor warned against a terrorist attack using a defibrillator like @entity119 showed in a recent episode
