by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 03:26 est , 8 august 2012 after securing the gold medal in an @entity4 race , many would avoid admitting that they cheated for fear of having their title taken away			0
that was not the case for @entity11 swimmer @entity10 who did just that			0
the 24 - year - old freely stated that he took an additional underwater kick at the start of his 100m breaststroke race last week but justified the move by saying that everyone does so			1
questionable kicks : @entity11 swimmer @entity10 won the 100m breaststroke last week both guilty : the footage shows that both van der @entity10 ( left ) and @entity25 @entity24 ( right ) took two vertical butterfly kicks immediately after diving in the water and before taking their sanctioned horizontal breaststroke kick ' if you 're not doing it , you 're falling behind , ' he told the @entity33			1
' it 's not obviously - shall we say - the moral thing to do , but i ’m not willing to sacrifice my personal performance and four years of hard work for someone that is willing to do it and get away with it			0
' victory : the 24 - year - old said that while the extra kick may not necessarily be ' moral ' it is what everyone does the @entity25 newspaper asked the @entity11 about the issue in depth because van der @entity10 narrowly beat out their native son @entity53 who came in second			2
@entity55 der @entity10 came in first in lane four , then @entity53 came in second in lane six and @entity60 @entity59 was in lane eight			0
because of the limited view of the underwater footage that was posted by @entity64 , van der @entity10 's kick - and that of his neighbor in lane five ( who came in seventh place ) are shown in detail			1
if his world - record time is taken away because of the extra kick , @entity71 could move up to first and @entity59 could earn a silver medal			0
the victor defends his title , however , saying that underwater video shows that the other swimmers near van der @entity10 did the same thing : they all took two quick vertical kicks immediately after diving in the water			1
participants are only technically allowed to take one quick vertical kick before going on to take a breaststroke kick ( which appears more horizontal ) while they are still gliding underwater from their dive			2
' i think it 's pretty funny of the @entity25 to complain because in the underwater footage if you actually look at @entity24 in the lane next to me , he ’s doing the exact same thing as me yet they ’re turning a blind eye , ' van der @entity10 told the paper			1
there is a complicated history over the use of the so - called dolphin kick , which is the kick officially used in butterfly , in breaststroke races and it was previously legal in the sport for an unspecified number of kicks			1
the competition : van der @entity10 seems pleased with himself after the race ( right ) while @entity112 of @entity113 congratulates him ( left ) now , certain races incorporate underwater video technology in their efforts to curtail misuse , but since the @entity4 is not one of those races , van der @entity10 believes that there is little incentive to keep to the rules			1
' i ’m really for it			0
if they can bring it , it will better the sport			0
but i ’m not willing to lose to someone that is doing it , ’ he said			0
@entity64 reports that while the swimming governing body - @entity134 - will presumably leave the results as they are , there is a chance that the @entity4 committee could reverse the results after reviewing the tape and van der @entity10 's revelations .			2

@entity10 , 24 , won the men 's 100m breaststroke race
underwater footage now shows that he took two ' dolphin ' kicks after his dive when the sport only allows swimmers to take one
other competitors can be seen doing the same move in the race
