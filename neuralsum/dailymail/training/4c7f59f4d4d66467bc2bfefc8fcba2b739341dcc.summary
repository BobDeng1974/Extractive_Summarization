@entity1 giant @entity0 is effectively pulling out of @entity2 after years of delays in trying to secure approval for ‘ @entity6 ’ crops			1
the @entity8 - based company is dropping all of its requests to launch insect and pesticide - resistant forms of corn , sugar beet and soya beans			0
campaigners said @entity0 had simply realised that the vast majority of people in @entity2 would not eat the foods			0
opposition : protesters stage a sit - in against @entity1 foods last year			2
@entity0 is dropping all of its requests to launch insect and pesticide - resistant forms of corn , sugar beet and soya beans because of public suspicion the decision will be a blow to @entity28 ’s fledgling @entity1 industry which has been championed by ministers in recent weeks			1
so far , biotech firms have been deterred from growing @entity1 crops in @entity2 by the tightest controls in the world			1
but the environment secretary , science minister and chief scientist have all publicly given the crops their blessing			2
only last month , environment secretary @entity39 said @entity40 was putting @entity28 jobs at risk by dragging its feet over @entity1 crops			1
he also made the extraordinary claim that millions of children in the developing world are ‘ dying or going blind ’ because the controversial technique has not been more widely adopted			0
however , the public remains deeply suspicious of @entity1 foods			2
a survey by the @entity50 last year found two in three believe food from animals given a @entity1 diet should be labelled as such			2
and a @entity55 study showed public support for so - called ‘ frankenstein foods ’ declining from 46 per cent in 2002 to only 27 per cent now			0
@entity58 : the public remains deeply suspicious of @entity1 foods , with only just over a quarter indicating they support them despite efforts by @entity63 claims that not using them will put @entity28 jobs at risk campaign groups have raised concerns over ministers ’ secret meetings with @entity1 lobby groups – details of which emerged following freedom of information requests			1
@entity76 member states have long been split on @entity1 , leading to delays in the licensing of new strains			2
only a handful of applications have been approved and the seven being withdrawn by @entity0 have been lodged for a cumulative total of 50 years			0
its @entity2 arm will now focus on conventional crops and weed killer			0
other @entity1 companies , such as @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 have also scaled back or dropped efforts to get crops accepted in @entity2			1
earlier this year @entity95 firm @entity91 abandoned plans for blight - resistant potatoes			0
@entity98 , the @entity99 ’s policy director , said : ‘ the fact is that there is no commercial market for @entity1 food in @entity2 , and therefore no commercial reason for farmers to grow @entity1 crops			1
’ campaign group @entity107 welcomed @entity0 ’s announcement but pointed out the firm ’s @entity1 crops will still be used in animal feed and biofuels			1
most meat , milk and eggs sold in @entity28 supermarkets come from animals that at some point have been given @entity1 feed imported from the @entity120			1
the decision will not affect @entity0 ’s existing @entity2 @entity1 crop , an insect - resistant maize			2
@entity124 is @entity2 ’s only genetically - modified plant cultivated commercially and is grown for animal feed in @entity127			0
globally , more than 12 per cent of the world ’s arable crops are devoted to @entity1 crops			1
@entity130 is concerned @entity2 risks being ‘ left behind ’ after @entity0 ’s decision			0
his official spokesman said : ‘ while the rest of the world is reaping the benefits of new technologies , @entity2 risks being left behind			0
we can not afford to let that happen			0

only a quarter of @entity28 support the *introduction* of @entity1 crops
but the *government* has thrown its *weight* behind their use
