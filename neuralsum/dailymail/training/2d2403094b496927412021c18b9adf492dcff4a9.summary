furious mps have accused @entity2 ’s tax authorities of ' failing ' the public by letting thousands of people stash their cash in @entity7 bank accounts			1
the chair of the @entity9 @entity8 said she was furious at the ' pathetic ' response to leaked @entity12 files which showed thousands of @entity2 - linked individuals held bank accounts in @entity7			1
it came after revelations @entity16 received a list of 6,800 @entity12 customers with @entity7 bank accounts five years ago – but had only managed to prosecute one person , despite £ 135million in owed tax being recovered			1
@entity29 was earlier accused of being ' up to his neck ' in the @entity7 bank account scandal after it emerged that a string of the individuals with @entity7 accounts were @entity37 donors			1
in a fiery commons debate , the prime minister insisted ' no - one had done more ' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance			0
but mr @entity42 said the pm was ' bang to rights ' , adding : ' he ca n't get away from it – he 's a dodgy prime minister , surrounded by dodgy donors			2
' mrs @entity8 meanwhile laid the blame at the door of the tax authorities for failing to act on the leaked list of @entity7 bank account owners			1
she said the activities related to the @entity53 branch of @entity12 's @entity7 subsidiary were ' pretty outrageous '			1
@entity16 chief @entity55 defended her record prosecuting tax dodgers @entity16 was offered a copy of a disk detailing @entity12 clients who had potentially avoided tax seven years ago – but ignored it			1
mrs @entity8 told @entity16 chief @entity55 that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower @entity63 , who initially obtained the list while employed as an it worker in 2007			1
ms @entity55 insisted that @entity16 staff had been ' diligent ' in their approach to the files , and said their record of securing one conviction and £ 135 million in unpaid tax , fines and interest compared well with other countries			1
but mrs @entity8 told her that the @entity77 tax authorities had recouped £ 200 million from 3,000 names and the @entity79 £ 180 million from 2,900			2
and she told the @entity16 chief : ' it 's pretty outrageous what was going on			2
' it 's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance , but of tax evasion , and that is incredibly serious			0
' for you to sit there and say , as you are doing , that ‘ we could n't get the money in in the same way as the @entity77 and @entity79 did ’ and ‘ we did n't litigate because we wanted to get the money in ’ and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the @entity2 taxpayer			0
' she added : ' the worst that can happen to you , if @entity16 can be bothered to catch up with you , is that you may have to pay , you wo n’t have a prosecution , you wo n’t have any shame , you wo n’t be an example to anybody else , you will get away with it			0
' that ’s a terrible message to give out to @entity2 taxpayers			1
' responding to ms @entity8 's comments , ms @entity55 insisted ‘ that is absolutely not the case ' and denied the agency had a ' soft ' approach to tax avoidance			2
some 300 staff , led by three directors , had been sifting through the data supplied by @entity77 authorities in 2010 and had traced 3,200 individuals , including 150 ‘ most serious ’ cases which could be considered for criminal prosecution , 500 which were ‘ more serious ’ but not likely to meet the criminal threshold and 400 - 500 which could be pursued for disclosure and settlement			0
@entity37 mp @entity126 said the decision to prosecute just one person sent out the message that there was little risk in dodging tax			2
ms @entity55 , who was branded ‘ ms incompetence ’ over her record at the @entity134 , said prosecutions were expensive and needed stronger evidence			0
she also insisted the agency ’s poster campaigns were effective in reducing tax avoidance			0
@entity42 today accused @entity29 of being ' up to his neck ' in the @entity7 bank account scandal but the prime minister said no government had done more to tackle tax avoidance since coming to power ms @entity55 , who was appointed to lead @entity16 in 2012 , said she believed the authority would have told government ministers about the data within months of receiving it			1
‘ we are confident we will have told ministers that we were about to receive a big tranche of operational information , ’ she said			0
‘ we will have told people , including ministers , i suspect some time in the next few months			0
’ @entity16 had previously told the committee that it hoped to bring about 15 cases to prosecution , but in the event three were passed on to the @entity161 , which decided to take just one to court			0
@entity16 officials are meeting with other agencies later this week to discuss a new investigation , the committee heard			0
this is thought to include the @entity168 and the police .			0
