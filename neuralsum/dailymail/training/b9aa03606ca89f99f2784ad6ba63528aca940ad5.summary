' @entity0 was less diplomatic			1
the @entity37 number eight said : ' after beating @entity12 you kind of feel like , " hey this is where we 're supposed to be "			0

you ca n't beat the world number one and then think you 're invincible			0
' hopefully we can come back , play the rugby we want to play and to produce			0
' @entity0 admits his performance was below - par , having been spoken of alongside @entity12 's @entity43 as the world 's best number eight in 2014			1
' i was n't great , ' added @entity0 , who tried to accentuate the positives			2
' it 's nice to learn how you get knocked off your high horse and you 've got to fight your way back			2
' every single game is a learning curve for each and every single player			0
' there 's always stuff to work on			2
you always want to be the best			0
' ( and ) when you 're up there you 've got to bloody work hard to stay there			0
' i still have a lot of goals that i want to reach , but i think we 're on the right track			0
i 've just got to keep working			0

it 's up to the @entity8 coaches to decide what 's good for their team this weekend			1

if you concede less than 15 , you 've got a good chance of winning a test match			2
statistically everyone 's around that level			0
' [ but ] there 's no point in conceding no tries and six penalties			0
if you get around that , you 'll win @entity135 matches			0
