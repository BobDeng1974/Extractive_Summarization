@entity1 drug cartels are finding it easier to smuggle drugs into the @entity4 thanks to border patrol officials being forced to deal with an unprecedented crisis of illegal migrants			1
@entity9 attorney general @entity8 recently requested an additional $ 30 million ( £ 17.6m ) in funding from the @entity4 @entity11 to help deploy more resources to the area			1
it comes on the heels of a massive 92 per cent spike from the same period last year in minors being apprehended at the border , thought to be mostly from @entity20 countries such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
' with the @entity40 ’s focus shifted to this crisis , we have grave concerns that dangerous cartel activity , including narcotics smuggling and human trafficking , will go unchecked because @entity40 resources are stretched too thin			1
' unless the @entity11 or another federal agency provides funding , the cartels - which are central to this crisis - will prevail because they profit from each illegal border crossing			2
' @entity51 , a @entity51 union representative told the @entity52 that smugglers were exploiting gaps created in the border when agents were pulled from their stations to deal with groups of people crossing the @entity31 river			0
he told the paper groups as large as 250 wade across and distract officers while the drug traffickers creep across hoping to pass by undetected			0
' after that they send over the dope , ' he said			0
young detainees are pictured being escorted to make phone calls at a processing centre in @entity69 , @entity70 in the @entity72 sector alone , the @entity40 made more than 160,000 apprehensions of illegal migrants between october 2013 and may 2014 - an increase of 70 percent over the same period the year before			0
authorities arrested 47,017 unaccompanied minors illegally crossing the border between october and may , up 92 percent from the same period a year earlier , with more than two - thirds of these arrests in the @entity72			0
startling photos taken last week document a handful of failed border crossing attempts - the images show young children and even babies sleeping in holding cells at a @entity90 processing facility in @entity91 , @entity9 , where they are held before being deported .			1

there are fears more drugs are being brought into the @entity4 by cartels south of the border , who are ready to exploit stretched @entity40 resources
@entity9 currently dealing with unprecedented number of young children , mostly from @entity20 countries , attempting to cross the border
