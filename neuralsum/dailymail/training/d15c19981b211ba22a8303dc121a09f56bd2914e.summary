by @entity0 worrying too much about stressful events can trigger inflammation , according to a new study			0
researchers found dwelling on negative events can increase levels of inflammation in the body			2
they discovered that when study participants were asked to ruminate on a stressful incident , their levels of c - reactive protein , a marker of tissue inflammation , rose			1
the study is the first time to directly measure this effect in the body			0
worrying too much ? researchers found dwelling on negative events can increase levels of inflammation in the body study lead author @entity22 , an assistant professor of psychology at @entity24 in the @entity25 , said : ' much of the past work has looked at this in non-experimental designs			1
' researchers have asked people to report their tendency to ruminate , and then looked to see if it connected to physiological issues			2
it 's been correlational for the most part			0
' the research team recruited 34 healthy young women to participate in the project			1
each woman was asked to give a speech about her candidacy for a job to two interviewers in white laboratory coats , who listened with ' stone - faced ' expressions			1
half of the group was asked to contemplate their performance in the public speaking task , while the other half was asked to think about neutral images and activities , such as sailing ships or grocery store trips			1
the researchers drew blood samples that showed that the levels of c - reactive protein were significantly higher in the subjects who were asked to dwell on the speech			1
the study found that when study participants were asked to ruminate on a stressful incident , their levels of c - reactive protein , a marker of tissue inflammation , rose for these participants , the levels of the inflammatory marker continued to rise for at least one hour after the speech			1
during the same time period , the marker returned to starting levels in the subjects who had been asked to focus on other thoughts			1
the c - reactive protein is primarily produced by the liver as part of the immune system 's initial inflammatory response			2
it rises in response to traumas , injuries or infections in the body			0
c - reactive protein is widely used as a clinical marker to determine if a patient has an infection , but also if he or she may be at risk for disease later in life			0
doctor @entity22 said : ' more and more , chronic inflammation is being associated with various disorders and conditions			0
' the immune system plays an important role in various cardiovascular disorders such as heart disease , as well as cancer , dementia and autoimmune diseases			0
' now dr @entity22 is working with @entity105 in @entity24 's @entity106 and @entity107 , a registered nurse and graduate student in the @entity109 , to investigate the effect of rumination on additional inflammation markers			2
she also hopes to study the issue in other populations , such as older adults , who might be vulnerable to rumination and health problems			0
she was due to present the findings at the annual meeting of the @entity120 in @entity121 .			0

researchers at @entity24 studied 34 healthy young women
they were asked to give a speech about her candidacy for a job
half of the group was asked to contemplate their performance
for this half of the group levels of an inflammatory marker rose
