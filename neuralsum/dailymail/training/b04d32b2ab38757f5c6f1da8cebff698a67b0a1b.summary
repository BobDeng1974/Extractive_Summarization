so where does @entity4 ’s shock 4 - 2 victory at @entity6 leaders @entity1 rank in the history of @entity9 upsets ? there is one man better placed than most to tell us			1
here , @entity14 ’s @entity13 – who has commentated on the competition since 1972 – runs @entity16 though his 10 greatest @entity9 giant - killing acts ... @entity19 commentator @entity13 has been working on @entity9 games for more than 40 years 10			1
@entity21 1 @entity22 0 , @entity23 , 1985 there was snow on the pitch but @entity21 fancied their chances because manager @entity29 got a load of volunteers in on the morning of the game to clear it			2
it was goalless with five minutes left when @entity21 got a penalty and @entity35 put it away			0
he then disappeared for a couple of years before popping up and scoring for @entity37 in the @entity38			0
@entity39 2 @entity40 0 , @entity41 , 1984 @entity42 ’s @entity40 were holders but they got turned over good and proper by @entity43 @entity39 , whose manager was a young @entity45			0
@entity40 even had @entity47 captain @entity46 in their side , but @entity45 ’s team were deserved winners and scored twice in five minutes after half - time through @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity52 cracks @entity40 's defence to score @entity39 's first goal at @entity57 in 1984 @entity52 lands and makes his way up off the turf to celebrate his memorable goal in the @entity9 third round 8			1
@entity62 2 @entity22 0 , @entity41 , 1933 @entity64 ’s team were the outstanding side in the country and this is the greatest pre-war @entity9 upset			1
@entity22 were so humiliated by @entity43 @entity62 that , on the train home , @entity64 sacked the defender who gave away one of the goals			2
@entity72 2 @entity22 1 , @entity41 , 1992 @entity22 were @entity73 champions at the time and this game had everything , brilliant goals , disallowed goals and drama until the last			1
@entity80 scored that belter of a free - kick into the top corner to equalise before @entity84 got the winner two minutes from the end – but there was still time for @entity22 to have a goal ruled out			1
@entity80 ( centre ) , scorer of @entity72 's first , passes @entity90 of @entity22 in 1992 @entity84 ( right ) scores the winning goal to produce a miraculous @entity9 upset at the @entity92 6			1
@entity93 0 @entity94 1 , @entity41 , 1975 this was the first time in 55 years that a non-league team beat a @entity73 side on their own ground			2
@entity100 played for @entity94 and @entity101 – who is club president to this day – was in goal			0
@entity104 1 @entity105 0 , @entity38 , 1973 i was at the @entity105 hotel on the morning of the game and they were awfully tense			0
@entity104 , on the other hand , were relaxed and laughing and joking			0
they were a @entity111 side and no - one gave them a chance			2
but they gave @entity117 ’s superstars a helluva game and , although @entity119 got the goal , it ’s @entity123 ’s double save which stands out in my memory			0
the late @entity119 ( fifth right ) fires the winning goal past @entity127 goalkeeper @entity126 @entity104 's captain @entity128 holds the @entity9 trophy aloft at @entity130 in may 1973 4			1
@entity131 2 @entity104 1 , @entity23 , 1949 @entity104 were n’t just a @entity73 side , they were known as the “ @entity133 ” of that era for the huge sums of money they ’d spent on the team			2
@entity131 , meanwhile , were in the @entity139			0
player - manager @entity141 was a real character , he scored for @entity131 and he went on to manage @entity143 in the 1975 @entity144			0
@entity1 2 @entity4 4 , @entity23 , 2015 now this would have still been a shock if @entity4 had won at @entity146 – but factor in @entity1 leading 2 - 0 at @entity148 and it is quite remarkable			1
@entity151 had never lost an fa cup match at home and , for me , this ranks as one of the greatest upsets of all time			0
@entity158 beats the @entity1 defence and slots home past @entity161 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity4 @entity4 's players celebrate their amazing comeback after the final whistle at @entity148 2			1
@entity166 2 @entity37 1 , @entity167 , 1989 i did this game and i remember @entity166 had been practising corners all morning and had n’t scored from one – then @entity172 puts them ahead from a corner and @entity172 scores the winner from a corner			0
their manager , @entity177 , was a character , a pipe - smoking and poetry - quoting old - school boss			0
and @entity37 , do n’t forget , had won the cup just 19 months earlier			0
@entity166 's @entity172 ( no 11 ) scores the winning goal against @entity37 in the @entity9 third round in 1989 @entity166 goalscorers @entity172 and @entity172 celebrate with champagne after the final whistle 1			2
@entity187 2 @entity188 1 , @entity167 , 1972 people forget that non-league @entity187 had already drawn 2 - 2 at @entity188 to earn a replay			1
@entity191 scored his famous rocket and that has to be the most replayed goal in the history of the competition			0
i was there and this game is everything which is brilliant about the @entity9 , the pitch was a bog and @entity188 ’s superstars such as @entity204 had been spouting off in the press , but they got their comeuppance alright			1
@entity187 fans and players rush to @entity191 after his screamer took the game to extra time @entity191 's 40 - yard strike hits the back of @entity188 goalkeeper @entity215 's net in the 1972 @entity9			1

@entity4 pulled off a shock to beat @entity1 4 - 2 at @entity148
