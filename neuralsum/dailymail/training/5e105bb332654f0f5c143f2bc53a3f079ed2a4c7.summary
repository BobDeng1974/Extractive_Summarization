a recently uncovered @entity1 skull could be the biggest ever found , according to a fossil hunter who hopes to sell it for more than $ 1million			1
@entity5 bought the skull from a colleague who unearthed it near @entity9 , @entity10 , and is planning to clean it up and attach it to the body of another @entity1 before selling it on			1

biggest ever ? the @entity1 skull unearthed near @entity9 , @entity10 , that one fossil hunter believes may be the biggest ever found valuable : @entity5 , pictured left preparing the skull for transport , bought the skull of a fellow fossil hunter and hopes to sell it on for more than $ 1million however , experts will not know how the size of the skull compares to others until the cleaning process is completed , which is likely to take as long as a year - and - a - half , the @entity27 reported			1
the paper caught up with mr @entity5 has he transported the eight - foot skull through their patch on a flat - bed truck on his way to @entity40			2
on his way he stopped at the @entity42 for help with analysis of the skull			2
the institute 's president @entity46 was impressed with the find , but could n't confirm it was the biggest ever			0
@entity54 used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures , a new theory @entity51 into @entity1 fossils from the @entity53 shows that the @entity62 apex predator first slew its prey , then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient - rich neck meat hidden by body @entity67 was well known to feed on the @entity1 but until now few have questioned how it got around the herbivore 's tough neck frill			1
mr @entity46 told the @entity27 the creature has a ' huge ' 16in nasal horn			0
' it 's definitely big , ' he said			2
' there 's no question about that			0

one of the most recognisable of all dinosaurs , the stocky herbivores had three horns and a large bony frill which covered their necks			0
it shared its habitat with and was a frequent meal of the fearsome tyrannosaurus , with which it is popularly represented as doing battle			0
they are also thought to have turned their horns on rivals in battles for dominance and courtship displays			2
despite their fame , there are thought to be only six mounts of original @entity1 skeletons in existence			1
' skeletons are quite rare even though they 're really well - known , ' mr @entity46 told the @entity27 , he added that skulls are more common , although there are still only about 100 that have been recovered			0
huge : mr @entity5 believes the owner of the skull may have been twice the size of an elephant , the modern day animal to which @entity1 are usually compared in size rare : he hopes to pair the skull with a skeleton he 's unearthing near @entity117 , @entity118 , before selling the complete dinosaur			1
there are thought to be currently only six complete triceratops in existence mr @entity5 , who has been a fossil hunter since the @entity124 , bought the skull from fellow fossil hunter @entity126 who dug it out of the ground over a few months			2
he now hopes to pair the skull with a skeleton he 's in the process of digging up near @entity117 , @entity118 , before selling the complete dinosaur			0
he told the @entity27 he expects the find to be valuable			0
' oh yeah , it 's going to be over a million bucks , ' he said .			0
