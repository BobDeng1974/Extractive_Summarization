by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:22 pm on 27th october 2011 inspirational soldier : @entity3 was crushed to death by a horse at a @entity7 parade held at @entity8 a soldier who survived having a leg amputated was killed when he was thrown from and then crushed by a horse during a @entity7 event , an inquest has heard			1
platoon sergeant @entity3 , 39 , had undergone just one hour of riding tuition before mounting a large former racehorse named @entity16 at @entity8 , @entity17			1
as sergeant @entity3 was being led back to the stables after the event the thoroughbred horse unexpectedly reared up , sending him tumbling off the back of the 16 - hand steed - around six ft tall			2
the former national hunt racehorse then fell backwards , crushing sgt. @entity3 beneath him , shattering his pelvis along with his ribs and back vertebrae			1
sgt. @entity3 , who served in the @entity27 , was treated in hospital , but later died			1
as a platoon sergeant serving with the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) in @entity31 , @entity32 , sgt. @entity3 was hailed as a role model by many of his colleagues thanks to the way he dealt with his life - changing amputation			1
the soldier had been selected to take part in the event because he had given fellow servicemen reassurance on how to cope with the loss of a limb			0
he chose to have the dramatic surgery on his right leg in august 2008 after suffering complications when he broke both ankles during an @entity49 drill			0
his widow , @entity50 , told the inquest into her husband 's death that her husband had been a keen charity fundraiser and had often acted as a mentor to younger soldiers who were living with similar injuries			2
she said : ' there were two soldiers who had been injured and he had to go and talk to them			0
' there was a young man who went through the same operation so @entity3 went round to speak to him and showed him his own leg			2
' mrs @entity65 said that her husband had been looking forward to taking part in the @entity67 at @entity8 , organised by @entity68 , an initiative offering adventure training and sports rehabilitation for soldiers , which was backed by military charity @entity7			2
unprepared : sgt. @entity3 , pictured with with @entity74 rugby star @entity73 , had just one hour of riding tuition ahead of the event the royal engineer had only taken an hour - long riding lesson at @entity79 a week before the event and was feeling confident about his stint on horseback			1
' he had been to @entity79 for a riding lesson , ' said mrs @entity65			0
' he rode motorbikes and he did well in the lesson so he was allowed to take part			0
' he was excited and looking forward to it			0
' other riders taking part in the parade on february 18 this year , were riding military horses but sgt. @entity3 was given ex-racehorse @entity16 to ride in front of 5,000 spectators			1
the original plan had been for seven soldiers to take part in a race but this was downgraded to a parade when there was not enough time to train the riders sufficiently			0
there was concern when the horse reared slightly during the five - lap ride around the @entity17 racecourse 's parade ring but the soldier leading sgt. @entity3 's was able to bring @entity16 under control			1
however , as the horse and rider were being led back to the stable after the parade , @entity16 reared up again , only this time he could not be controlled and sgt. @entity3 was thrown to the ground where the horse fell onto him			1
death fall : the accident happened at @entity8 in @entity17 and is best known for its racecourse the soldier was taken to @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 , where he died on march 16 of bronchial pneumonia caused by the multiple injuries he sustained during the crush			2
@entity16 's owner @entity124 said that she had never known the horse to rear up before , and that it was used to being handled or ridden by different people			0
however , she said she had been shocked when she learned sgt. @entity3 had barely ridden before			1
other riders in the event had been given military horses from the @entity131 to ride , which the inquest at @entity133 heard tended to be more docile , less easily spooked and more suitable for riders with limited experience			1
' he went right over , which caused his injuries , ' she said			0
charity : the event was organised by @entity68 and supported by the @entity7 campaign ' i 'm not blaming anyone but it 's very unfortunate			2
' thoroughbred horses are like @entity146 cars and you have to treat them in a certain way , with a huge amount of respect			0
' mrs @entity124 said that sgt. @entity3 had been using a custom - made saddle for @entity16 as well as her own stirrups , which she said would have been suitable for use with his prosthetic leg			1
she said that it was likely that when the horse had reared up , as an inexperienced rider sgt. @entity3 's reaction would have been to pull on the reins - which only would have made the situation worse			1
a @entity163 investigation ruled that the accident could not have been forseen and that all procedures had been followed prior to the parade			0
however , lieutenant colonel @entity167 who investigated sgt. @entity3 's fall on behalf of the @entity49 said that following the death he had recommended that at future events horses and riders should be matched according to capability , with injuries taken into account			1
he said : ' at any event the competence of the rider should be assessed			0
' there needs to be some form of standards assessment			0
' he also said that horses and riders should train together prior to any event , preferably at the venue itself			0
@entity17 coroner @entity187 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
' @entity3 slipped off the back of the horse and in all probability him holding onto the reigns pulled the horse 's head back , which would exacerbate the situation of the horse , ' he said .			2

sgt. @entity3 , 39 , was crushed to death in front of 5,000 spectators at @entity8
he *'d* had only one hour 's riding tuition before event
inquest hears he was given ex-racehorse while others rode more docile military *animals*
