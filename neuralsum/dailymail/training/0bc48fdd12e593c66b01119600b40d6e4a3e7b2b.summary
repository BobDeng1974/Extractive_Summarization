around 50 animals can be found ranging the @entity14 , such as these pictured , while the remainder stay the @entity17 - some 30 miles away			1
born free : the @entity8 , pictured , is @entity18 's only free - roaming group of reindeer and can be found in the @entity7 in @entity12 numbers : there are 150 animals in the herd - some of which roam the @entity14 mountains while the others stay in the @entity17 30 miles away @entity28 's little helper : the hard - working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months the reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a @entity35 reindeer herder , @entity36			1
he started with just a few reindeer , but the herd has grown over the years			0
it is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding , with most deer being born in the summer months			2
an account of the introduction written by mr @entity36 is featured on the official website for the animals			0
one - off : the reindeer , more commonly associated with @entity9 , were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by @entity35 reindeer herder @entity36 running free : the herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding well looked after : the animals are monitored and cared for by staff at the @entity54 in @entity55 , which was founded by the animal herder in it , he says : ' looking across @entity58 to the @entity14 from the railway bridge at @entity60 on a cold morning in april 1947 , i was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in @entity9			2
' in 1952 , i brought some of my @entity35 mountain reindeer to @entity12 as an experiment , to show that they could live and breed in these surroundings			0
' official difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the interest shown by the press and the influence of the @entity73 of the @entity18			0
' the animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of november and december			2
meet and greet : visitors to the centre can go on guided tours of the area and even meet some of the free - roaming animals explorer : this rather intrepid animal looks far more at home in the @entity7 than @entity9 in the winter months , teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit @entity87 parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive spirit			1
