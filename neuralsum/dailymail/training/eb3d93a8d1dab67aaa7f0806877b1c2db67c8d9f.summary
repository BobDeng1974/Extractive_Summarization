by @entity1 reporter published : 12:32 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 15 november 2013 @entity2 still ca n't bring himself to utter the word ' comeback			1
' yet all signs point to the world 's greatest swimmer returning to the pool for the 2016 @entity9			1
in the strongest signal yet that his retirement wo n't last much longer , @entity10 has rejoined the @entity15 drug testing program — a necessary step for any athlete hoping to compete in an @entity19 sport			1
return ? one of the most successful olympians ever could be ready to come out of retirement ' i have no idea what 's going to happen , ' @entity10 told @entity25 in an exclusive telephone interview from @entity27 , where he was attending an @entity30 meet and even got in some impromptu training in the diving well			1
' if i really do start getting excited and wanting to do it , i can make that choice			0
if not , at least it 's something we can say we prepared for			0
' @entity10 said he 's merely giving himself the option of competing again and stressed that ' nothing is set in stone			1
' but the doping program is a major inconvenience , requiring him to be available for random testing and keep officials apprised of his whereabouts			2
powerhouse : @entity10 won 18 gold medals in his peerless career in the pool ' it is a challenging thing to do , ' he said			1
' we are covering all the bases just in case			0
' @entity10 has won the most and is indeed the most decorated athlete in @entity19 history			1
he captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last three @entity63 , shattering the previous marks			1
he is best known for breaking @entity66 's record for a single @entity67 by winning eight gold medals at @entity69 in 2008			1
the @entity70 said @entity10 was among the athletes who underwent doping tests in the third quarter , the period ending sept. 30			2
his longtime coach and close friend , @entity77 , said @entity10 actually re-entered the doping program near the end of the second quarter , but he was n't tested and therefore was n't listed in that @entity70 report			1
he would be eligible to compete again in march , according to @entity77			2
' i just think he 's in a place where he 's feeling good about swimming , ' @entity77 said			1
' if he chooses to compete , he 's got some time			0
i like having the ability to do it			0
to be perfectly honest , he 's not anywhere near being able to compete in a meet or anything like that			0
we 're just getting started on improving his fitness			0
we 'll see where that goes			0
' powerhouse : @entity10 won 18 gold medals in his peerless career in the pool @entity10 has been training with @entity77 's team at the @entity99			1
each week , he 's been working a couple of days in the pool , a couple of days in the weight room , and one or two days on his core training			1
he has lost about 15 pounds and is back in the low 190s , not far off his competition weight			0
' if i decide to keep going and swim again , then i 'll compete , ' he said			0
' if i do n't , ' he added , letting out a big laugh , ' i guess i 'll re-retire			0
just do n't compare me to @entity109			0
' a possible comeback by the 22 - time @entity19 medallist has been mooted for a good year with fellow @entity15 @entity112 vocal for some time that his friend and rival would return to the pool			1
that would appear now to be the case with the @entity119 swimmer having already undergone two doping tests			0
by subjecting himself to drug testing , the 28 - year - old @entity10 has given himself plenty of time to go through an entire season before the next major meet , the 2015 world championships in @entity128 , an important steppingstone to the @entity130 the following summer			1
@entity131 , the world governing body for swimming , requires an athlete to be tested for at least nine months before taking part in sanctioned events			2
@entity70 said @entity10 was among the athletes who underwent doping tests in the period ending september 30			2
it means the 28 - year - old will be eligible to compete in the trials for the @entity143 in @entity144 in 2015			0
' there 's no grand scheme , ' @entity77 said			1
' it just sort of makes sense that he can make some choices if he wants to			0
' no 1 : but can @entity10 be on top of the world again in @entity152 in 2016 @entity10 attended the world championships in @entity154 this past summer , but he seemed even more pumped about being on hand for one of the more mundane events that fall between the @entity19 years			1
' just being around this is exciting for me , ' he said from @entity27			0
' it really has been a part of my life ever since i was a kid			0
' @entity10 ' return would surely be welcomed by the entire sport and even those who only follow swimming during the @entity67			1
' i think it would be great for the sport , ' said @entity169 , a relay gold medalist at the @entity171 who trains with @entity10 at @entity119			2
' he elevated it so much before that i think it can only get bigger with him in it			0
obviously he 's the greatest swimmer of all time — doubled everyone 's medal counts — so to have him on your relay only helps the @entity15 win more golds			1
' at the @entity143 in @entity154 last summer when asked of a comeback , @entity10 said : ' if anybody would know about me coming back it would be myself and i have n't said one thing to anybody about anything			1
' but i am here watching it , enjoying myself			0
' i enjoying playing golf , i enjoy getting up at noon - it 's a good life			2
' while apparently exasperated by such questions , it seems @entity10 was already looking ahead			2
a possible rematch with @entity195 is intriguing , the @entity196 who had pictures of @entity10 on his wall as a child before taking his 200 metres butterfly crown in @entity202			2
possibly this is one of @entity10 ' motivations			2
new king in town : @entity195 took @entity10 ' 200m butterfly crown in @entity67 @entity10 ' appeal goes far beyond the pool deck			1
his recognition factor has often matched athletes from far more prominent sports , such as @entity214 star @entity213 , a truly impressive accomplishment for a swimmer			0
@entity10 retired after winning six more medals at last summer 's @entity67 , adamant that all his goals were met and he had no desire to still be swimming in his 30s			1
he will be 31 by the time of the opening ceremony for the @entity130 — not that old , really , for today 's elite swimmers			1
one of his top rivals , @entity112 , is a year older and has every intention of competing through the next @entity67			0
if there is a comeback , @entity10 would n't be doing it for the money , having earned tens of millions of dollars in endorsements during his career			2
he remains a marketable name , even in retirement , though his endorsement potential certainly goes up if he 's in the water			0
more likely , this is another case of an athlete who simply missed the thrill of competition and is still young enough to do something about it , assuming he can find the motivation to endure @entity77 's grueling regimen for nearly three more years			1
' there are a lot of things that really excite me ... that get me motivated , ' @entity10 said			2
' but i swam for 20 years			0
that 's something that 's going to be very , very hard to top			0

after months of hints and half - *denials* , @entity2 has re-entered the drug testing pool for *international* competition
it 's the strongest signal yet that he 's *planning* a return to swimming
@entity10 has won a record 22 @entity19 medals , *including* 18 golds
the swimmer has not *announced* a comeback for @entity130 but joined the @entity15 drug - testing program
champion has been working out with his former coach @entity77
