since the former @entity37 manager was appointed , @entity0 have beaten @entity38 6 - 0 and won a @entity40 tournament also involving @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 last month			0
@entity33 named a mixture of establish youth internationals and debutants , one of whom was @entity4 defender @entity11 , who understandably received a warm welcome from the near - 7,000 crowd			2
the visiting @entity53 gave @entity0 an early fright when @entity55 darted through the @entity0 back line , only to fire off a tame shot that presented no problem for @entity60 keeper @entity59			2
@entity0 's @entity61 holds off the challenge of @entity3 's @entity63 during the @entity4 friendly @entity0 's captain @entity65 controls the ball under pressure from @entity68 @entity33 preserved his unbeaten start as under 20 manager but had to settle for a draw @entity0 soon found their stride and took the lead on the quarter - hour			1

the @entity9 frontman saw a couple of other chances go begging before half - time as @entity0 continued to press , including a header that flashed inches wide of the post			0
despite a defensive reshuffle to compensate for the loss of @entity93 's @entity92 to injury , @entity0 continued to press after the break and @entity97 man @entity96 forced a finger - tip save from @entity99			0
but @entity3 left the hosts stunned when @entity101 winger @entity15 ran half the length of the field to fire home and equalise on 48 minutes			0
@entity105 shields the ball from @entity20 during the 2 - 2 draw at the @entity10 @entity0 's goalscorer @entity8 holds off the challenge of @entity109 during the game the two teams line up for the national anthems in front of a 7,000 - strong crowd at @entity4 @entity33 , who had fielded an attack - minded 4 - 3 - 3 formation , further strengthened his forward line by introducing @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity105 in the second half			1
but in the end it was @entity11 , a defender , who restored their lead with a thumping header just five minutes from the end			0
it looked as though @entity0 would claim a deserved victory but , in stoppage time , @entity59 failed to collect a free - kick from @entity132 and @entity20 was left to fire into an empty net			1
