’ another shouted : ‘ this is a failure of medical services , judge			0
’ mr @entity26 told the defendant : ‘ this was an act of utterly horrendous cruelty on your part on an animal that , as far as i could see , had come to trust you and rely on you			0

he said : ‘ she thought that the kitten had killed the fish and she was really upset and angry with the cat and she said she put the cat in the microwave			1
’ the prosecutor said @entity2 told nurses that she had stopped taking her medication because she did not want to fall into a deep sleep in case the kitten attacked the fish			1

mr @entity32 said his client had stopped taking her medication because ‘ the @entity139 had told her not to ’			0

but when he was pressed by the district judge about whether his client ‘ knew what she was doing ’ , mr @entity32 said : ‘ i 'm afraid that 's right			0
’ he said she ‘ just lost her temper ’ and acted ‘ totally out of character ’			0
@entity153 , mr @entity26 said : ‘ i have concluded , after careful thought , that the utterly barbaric nature of the act that you carried out in relation to this animal does demand a deterrent sentence			2
’ the district judge refused an application for unemployed @entity2 to make a contribution towards the @entity66 's costs , which he was told ran into hundreds of pounds			2
after the case , an @entity66 spokeswoman said : ‘ this was such a sad case and clearly this poor kitten would have suffered terribly over a prolonged period of time			0
