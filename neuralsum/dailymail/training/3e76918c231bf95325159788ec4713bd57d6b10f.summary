by @entity1 reporter and @entity3 reporter a woman whose childhood rapes by her uncle were captured on camera and widely traded on the internet wants the @entity9 to make it easier for victims of child pornography to collect money from people who view the brutal images on their computers			1
@entity17 , 48 , is being sued by a woman for looking at child pornography of her being raped as a child by her uncle the case being argued at the @entity9 on wednesday involves a @entity24 man who pleaded guilty to having images of children engaged in sex acts on his computer			1
@entity17 , 48 , of @entity30 , @entity24 , is appealing an order holding him responsible for the full amount of losses , nearly $ 3.4 million , suffered by the woman known as @entity35			1
@entity17 was arrested in 2009 after an employee at a computer company found sexually explicit images of minors on his computer			2
of the 150 - 300 incriminating images found on @entity42 's computer , just two were of @entity35			1
@entity17 pleaded guilty and received a 24 - month prison sentence , according to the @entity44			2
@entity35 , now her early 20s and living in @entity47 , was a child when her uncle sexually abused her and widely circulated images of the abuse , according to court records			1
the @entity51 said it has found at least 35,000 images of @entity35 's abuse in more than 3,200 child pornography cases since 1998			1
in at least 174 cases , @entity35 has been awarded restitution in amounts ranging from $ 100 to more than $ 3.5 million			2
a case before the @entity9 @entity59 brought forward by a child pornography victim is vying to change the way such victims can seek restitution from offenders			1
a woman identified as ' @entity35 ' , who was raped by her uncle and the subsequent images circulated online , is seeking $ 3.4 million from @entity17 , a @entity24 man found in possession of the images she has collected more than $ 1.5 million , one of her attorneys has said			1
in another case involving @entity35 and a second woman , the 9th @entity71 in @entity72 threw out a restitution order because it found there was not a sufficient link between a man convicted of possessing child pornography and the women			1
advocates for child pornography victims say that holding defendants liable for the entire amount of losses better reflects the ongoing harm that victims suffer each time someone views the images online			1
last year , the full 5th @entity71 in @entity90 said in a 10 - 5 decision that victims do not have to show a link between the crime and their injuries			0
the threat of a large financial judgment , coupled with a prison term , also might deter some people from looking at the images in the first place , the advocates say			0
' the threat that a person in the child pornography market may well bear the entire cost of the harm done to the victim , even if they are a '' minor player '' , is likely to be a large deterrent , especially when the harm done typically runs into the millions for a victim 's lifetime of care , ' said @entity115 , a law professor at @entity116			2
@entity117 wrote a brief in the case on behalf of the @entity120			0
the @entity121 will take up a case about when victims of child pornography can recover money from people convicted of viewing their abuse the money is intended to cover the cost of her psychological care , lost income and attorneys ' fees			2
thirty - four states , dozens of victims ' rights and child advocacy groups , local prosecutors and members of @entity140 are urging the court to uphold the ruling against @entity42 by the @entity90 - based 5th @entity71			2
no one has intervened on @entity42 's behalf			0
but his lawyer , @entity146 of @entity147 , said in court papers that there is no link between the restitution ordered by the appeals court and @entity42 's conduct			0
' an award of $ 3.4 million against an individual for possessing two images of child pornography is punitive and grossly disproportionate , ' @entity146 said			1
the $ 3.4 million estimate on the damages to the victim was calculated by a psychologist working for @entity162 , an attorney for @entity35			1
the @entity164 administration is trying to steer a middle course			0
solicitor general @entity166 said the government agrees with @entity35 that her injury comes from the widespread viewing on the internet of the assaults by her uncle			0
' the real question is whether ... a court must impose all of @entity35 's aggregate losses on each defendant			0
on that issue , @entity35 and the government take different views , ' @entity166 told the court			0
the administration said the correct answer is greater than zero and less than the entire amount and said trial judges should make the determination			0
the issue centers on the interpretation of the federal law granting restitution to victims of sex crimes , including child pornography			2
regardless of the outcome of the court case , @entity140 could change the law			0
the @entity197 recommended that lawmakers consider doing just that to eliminate confusion among federal judges about the right way to calculate restitution			0
@entity35 's lawyers estimate that tens of thousands of people worldwide have collected and viewed @entity35 's images .			0
