by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 12 august 2013 a @entity2 cargo ship is attempting to sail to @entity3 via an @entity5 ' short - cut ' that could shave almost two weeks off the journey time			2
shipping firm @entity8 's vessel the @entity9 , a 19,000 - tonne freighter , set sail from @entity12 , @entity2 , on tuesday bound for @entity13 , in a bid to complete the country 's first ever commercial transit of the @entity17 over @entity18			1
the northerly journey via the @entity20 , which the changing climate is making possible for longer periods thanks to melting sea ice , is expected to take 35 days - compared with the 48 days it takes to complete the traditional route through the @entity26 and the @entity27			1
historic : the @entity2 vessel set sail from @entity12 bound for @entity3 via the @entity17 last week the entire @entity17 - also known as the @entity17 - along the @entity18 coast lies in @entity5 waters , and parts are free from ice for only two months of the year			1
but climate change means @entity5 lanes are opening up for longer stints due to melting sea ice			1
it means icebreakers are no longer required under @entity18 rules for all @entity5 route journeys , according to a report in the @entity44			1
if it becomes easier to use the quicker @entity17 it could dramatically reduce shipping costs			1
there has been a boom in the number of vessels intent on sailing all or part of the passage			0
@entity18 authorities have granted 372 permits to ships this year - more than eight times the 46 full transits made in 2012			0
there were just four in 2010			0
but despite the impact of climate change , experts say it will be some time before the @entity17 rivals the @entity62 in terms of traffic			0
' climate change is certainly opening new @entity5 shipping routes , ' @entity65 , a @entity66 author who sailed the @entity67 in 2009 , told the @entity44 ' but the most common routes through the [ @entity5 ] continue to have ice even in the warmest years , meaning shipping companies will have to be selective and opportunistic in using them			0
' from @entity2 : the vessel set sail from the port of @entity12 in northeastern @entity2 on tuesday to @entity3 : the crew are hoping to reach the @entity80 port of @entity13 on september 11 - a transit time of just 35 days @entity82 , captain of @entity18 ’s @entity84 fleet of nuclear - powered icebreakers , estimates that 15million tonnes of cargo will use the full route by 2021			1
that compares to the 929million tonnes of cargo transported via the @entity62 in 2011			0
' you might see some oil and gas leave @entity18 – but i think the day that container ships will choose to use the northern sea route for economic reasons is quite a long way off , ' said one of @entity100 ’s biggest shipowners			0
the traditional route that links @entity2 to the @entity102 threads its way through the @entity104 , the @entity105 and the @entity106			0
the @entity9 will take the 5,400k route via @entity17 , which offers a relatively straight course over @entity18			2
it is expected to reach @entity13 on september 11 - a journey of just 35 days .			2

the @entity9 set sail from @entity12 bound for @entity13 last week
hopes to navigate @entity5 route over @entity18 within 35 days
traditional route via @entity62 and the @entity27 takes 48 days
melting sea ice means @entity5 lanes are passable for longer periods
quicker transit times could dramatically reduce shipping costs
