his book @entity32 could even become an unlikely best - seller - today there were only two copies left for sale on @entity34			0

it ’s not just about buses , it ’s about the rural scenery and the signs of the times			1
' none of the pictures were taken at bus stations or stances but all over the @entity6 in rural sightings			1
' i just did it for fun			0
i love travelling around and talking to people			2
it ’s an unusual topic for a book			0
the photographs are unique , nobody else was doing it at the time			0
' mr @entity2 practised medicine in @entity69 and other towns across the north of @entity72 before becoming a surgeon based in @entity74			1
his obsession with buses began with his 17 - mile journey to and from school every day and in 1961 he bought his first 35mm camera with colour slides			2
bus fan : @entity82 @entity2 has clocked up an estimated 100,000 miles on his bus journeys across the @entity6 retro : this bus , pictured in @entity86 in 1977 , seems to be heading to ' @entity87 ' @entity89 landscape : this picture was taken in @entity91			1

he said : ' i hitchhiked everywhere to get there as i did n’t have a car			0
' you just stood and smiled and people stopped in those days			0
i occasionally travelled by bus but only short distances because i could n’t afford it			0
' i loved the scenery and the idea of narrow rural roads in the @entity6			1
they were n’t just straightforward a to @entity123 bus routes			0
buses were part of social life back then			2
it was a vital form of transport			0
' after moving to @entity129 as a medical student in the 1960s , @entity2 continued to visit the @entity6 at least twice every year			1
his favourite spot was the nuclear reactor in @entity134 , @entity135 , where 40 old buses dropped off and picked up staff			2
@entity2 said : ' there were no youth hostels in @entity140 so i often stayed in police cells and signed out at six o’clock in the morning			2
' you could do that back then because there was nowhere else to stay			0
there were very elderly buses in @entity134			0
line up : double decker are parked up at a depot in @entity129 in 1976 passion : @entity2 moved to @entity129 to study medicine in the 1960s but kept returning to the @entity6 to take more photos important : for isolated communities , @entity23 buses were an important part of social life for many years unusual : @entity2 said he often stayed in police cells in @entity140 because there were no youth hostels ' staff actually complained because there were no platform doors and some buses had no heaters which was not good in the winter			1
' 40 buses used to sit outside the plant all day and for a young enthusiast like me it was a fantastic line up			0
i could wander in freely which you would n’t be able to do now			0
' the buses which @entity2 photographed were operated by @entity176 part of the state - owned @entity177 that operated services throughout @entity72			1
the company ran services throughout the @entity6 , from @entity140 and @entity181 in the far north through @entity182 to @entity183 in the south , and west to @entity185 and the ferry to @entity187			2
over the decades he has spent photographing buses , @entity2 has noticed a number of changes in the way they are operated			1
he said : ' back then there were bus conductors who worked with the driver as a team and it was a much more leisurely way of life			0
colourful : the rugged terrian of @entity202 in january , 1977 special service : conductors were known to deliver prescriptions for people years ago audience : the book was created with book enthusiasts in mind , but @entity2 thinks readers have also been struck by the scenery success : after receiving positive feed back on @entity17 , @entity2 is working on a follow - up about buses in @entity187 and the @entity217 modern methods : @entity2 says conductors now stick to a strict timetable and there is less communication with passengers enthusiast : retired doctor and amateur photographer @entity2 with his book @entity32 ' the conductors and drivers would spend a lot of time chatting with passengers			1
some buses were even known to take prescriptions to houses			0
' it was part of community life			0
now , the schedules are so tight and there are no conductors			0
' @entity2 is still travelling far and wide to take pictures of buses but he admits he rarely uses a bus to get there			1
following the success of his book , he is currently working on another which will feature buses in @entity187 and the @entity217 where he worked for a number of years			2
@entity2 added : ' @entity32 has been selling really well and people seem to be taking to that nostalgia			2
' the book was put together with bus enthusiasts in mind but because of the period and the scenery it has captured a wider audience			0
' i still drive all over the country , going around the @entity6 and other remote locations to take pictures of buses but sadly there is n’t much variety these days			1

@entity2 , 72 , fell in love with @entity270 as a schoolboy
spent more than 50 years travelling across @entity6 taking pictures
' it 's not just the buses , it 's the rural scenery ' says the former surgeon
