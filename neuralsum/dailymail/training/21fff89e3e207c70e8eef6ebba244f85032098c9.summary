by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 17:12 est , 27 august 2013 @entity1 sent out mixed messages on @entity3 yesterday , with @entity4 striking a far more cautious tone than @entity6			1
mr @entity6 , now a @entity7 ‘ peace envoy ’ , called for a major @entity9 intervention in @entity3 to prevent it becoming ‘ mired in carnage ’ and a ‘ breeding ground for extremism ’			1
the former prime minister said he understood the ‘ impulse to stay clear of the turmoil ’			0
but he added : ‘ we have , collectively , to understand the consequences of wringing our hands not putting them to work			0
’ however , the current @entity1 leadership struck a much more cautious note			1
mixed messages : former @entity1 prime minister @entity6 , left , has called for major @entity9 intervention in @entity3 , but current @entity1 leader @entity4 , right , has said only that he would ' consider ' backing an attack shadow foreign secretary @entity25 said @entity1 would not give the government a ‘ blank cheque ’ on @entity3 , despite the apparent use of chemical weapons by tyrant @entity30 last week			1
mr @entity25 said @entity1 mps could even be ordered to vote against military action if mr @entity33 fails to make the case in the @entity35 tomorrow			1
‘ we still do n’t know what the government ’s strategic objective would be - how achievable that objective is , ’ he said			0
‘ we do n’t know the legal basis on which the government would seek to be acting ; we do n’t know the international support that it would be seeking to galvanise			0
cautious : shadow foreign secretary @entity25 said @entity1 would not give the government a ' blank cheque ' on @entity3 ' so there are very legitimate issues of real concern which i think we ’ve got an obligation to be asking the government in these critical days			1
i ’m not ruling out the possibility that @entity1 could support the government , but i ’m certainly not prepared to write the government a blank cheque			2
' he went on : ‘ if we were n’t convinced , yes we would whip @entity31 ( against the government ) - it would be a party position in terms of the case that the @entity60 had made			0
but frankly , we ’re not at that stage because ... we still have n’t had from the government either the evidence or indeed the military objectives that it would need to set out before @entity70 to try and justify the course of action that is apparently at least in contemplation			0
’ mr @entity4 was called in to @entity74 yesterday afternoon for a personal briefing on the government ’s plans , and the case for intervention			0
speaking afterwards , mr @entity4 said he was willing to ‘ consider ’ backing limited military action but did not offer a guarantee			1
‘ the use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians is abhorrent and can not be ignored , ’ mr @entity4 said			0
‘ when i saw the prime minister this afternoon i said to him the @entity1 would consider supporting international action but only on the basis that it was legal , that it was specifically limited to deterring the future use of chemical weapons and that any action contemplated had clear and achievable military goals			2
‘ we will be scrutinising any action contemplated on that basis			0
’ former foreign secretary @entity95 acknowledged that the experience of the @entity98 war had made mps more sceptical about swallowing @entity60 claims in the run - up to military action			1
but he added : ‘ there is an instinct in the @entity104 to support a @entity106 prime minister , of whatever party , where he or she is recommending military action			2
‘ so that will be part of the instinct , but also there is no doubt that the experience of @entity98 has raised the bar of scepticism by the @entity104 on behalf of the @entity106 people about whether military action is justified			2

former *pm* @entity6 calls for major @entity9 intervention in @entity3
but current @entity1 leadership strikes a much more cautious note
labour mps could be whipped to vote against military action
