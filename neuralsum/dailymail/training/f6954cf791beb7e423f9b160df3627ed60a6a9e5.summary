by @entity0 when quitting a job , most of us would have something else lined up - but not @entity6 's @entity5			1
showing the brassy qualities of her character @entity8 , she 's walking out on @entity10 's biggest show in june - her first and only acting role - even if it means a spell of unemployment			1
' there 's no plan , ' she says			1
' i 'm going to go with the flow and if i get another job straight away , great , but if i do n't then i do n't			2
i have things in the pipeline but nothing 's set in stone			1
' @entity5 is n't worried about having a spat of unemployment when she leaves @entity6 this june it looks like a bold decision , especially now there 's no way back - after initially telling her she could return , the producers decided @entity8 would be murdered			1
says @entity5 , ' when they told me i was being killed off , i got a bit nervous			1
' @entity5 , 26 , who 's won a host of awards , can take comfort from those who 've left @entity6 and gone on to impressive careers			1
' @entity37 went on to do amazing things , and @entity39 has n't stopped working since leaving			2
i 'd love to follow suit			2
i 'd like to do a bit of drama , a bit of comedy			0
lots of variation , ideally			0
' she first set foot on the @entity49 in 2008 , less than a year after starting to train as an actor , as the short - term girlfriend of @entity52			1
' from day one i felt like an imposter			0
i did n't feel i had a right to be there , ' says the @entity57 - born actress			0
' i 'm a northern girl who grew up watching @entity6 , so it was a massive deal			1
' @entity5 has been on the set of @entity6 for six years @entity5 admits dealing with the overnight fame was tricky			1
' it 's a different sort of fame when you 're in a soap , ' she admits			2
' people feel as though they know you , and nothing prepares you for that			0
' and her strangest fan mail ? ' i was sent an engagement ring with a proposal			0
the guy said he wanted me to wear it so everyone would know we were engaged			0
i had to send it back			0
' in her six years on the show , @entity5 's been at the heart of gripping storylines , including having a secret abortion , accusing @entity82 of murdering her father , and becoming a surrogate mother for friends			1
her decision to leave has the backing of her fiancé , reality star turned radio and tv host @entity91 , 27			1
the pair got engaged last september after a nine - month courtship and will wed in the summer			0
' the idea of marriage is so appealing and with @entity96 knew straight away , ' she insists			0
she says she wants four children			0
' my mum 's told me how exhausting it is but when the time comes i 'll be ready			2
' but until june , @entity6 is @entity5 's main focus - as her on - screen affair with married @entity103 becomes increasingly messy , with @entity8 and @entity103 's wife both telling him they 're pregnant			1
' @entity8 's excited at the prospect of being a mum , ' says @entity5			1
' she thinks if she 's pregnant with @entity103 's child she 'll be more than just the mistress			2
so she 's going to be very hurt and angry if she finds out @entity110 's pregnant too - and i 'm sure she 'll want to make @entity103 pay			2
' cats or dogs ? dogs			0
i have two , a sausage dog called @entity115 and a @entity116 named @entity117			0
celebrity @entity118 or @entity119 ? do n’t tell the bride – although sometimes i ’m horrified by what the groom is doing ! mojito or @entity124 ? @entity124 - it reminds me of holidays ! @entity126 or @entity127 ? i love @entity126			0
my favourite dish is probably a creamy pasta one like a @entity130 : sun or snow ? definitely sun. i ’ve never been skiing , though people say you love it once you try @entity137 or @entity138 ? @entity138 for her rom - @entity139 or pub ? i love a good pub meal , but for a night out it really has to be a club or bar .			0

this june @entity5 will leave the set of @entity6
she says that she 's not worried about facing unemployment
she says she 's looking *forward* to married life with fiancé , @entity91
