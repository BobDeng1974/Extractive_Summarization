co-tenants : @entity5 took possesion of her south @entity9 home and found she was not the only occupant worth the price ? @entity23 paid $ 1million for the house but did not know about the mice problem decisions : @entity12 may sue the previous owner who did not inform her about the problem , although he claims he did not know the nest was discovered after she began renovating the house by opening up the walls			1
' all you see is just feces and urine , just puddles and piles , ' @entity12 told @entity37			2
' the whole vapour barrier is just filled with this nest			2

' now i have a shell , which i love , and it will be clean			2
but someone 's got to help me , ' she continued			2

although @entity12 did not have the home inspected before she took possession she had been there with architects , engineers and contractors and nobody noticed anything amiss			0
the house 's previous owner said he knew nothing about an issue with mice and confirmed he would never have sold the property if he had			1
@entity56 said it is possible the owner might not have known because the walls and insulation were both thick			1
no inspection : although an inspection of the house would not include a check inside the walls the problem may have been discovered a @entity8 @entity101 spokesman said the matter will most likely need to be settled in court			0
@entity104 , a @entity9 home inspector , said an infestation on this scale is rare in the city			0
he confirmed that although a full inspection would not include a check for this it may still have caught the mice issue			0
