an ‘ army of legal superstars ’ persuaded prosecutors to sign a controversial agreement which may have given prince @entity3 protection from prosecution , it is claimed			1
highly - paid lawyers for @entity8 – some of whom had links to the @entity12 – secured an extraordinary deal which guaranteed ‘ potential co-conspirators ’ would not face criminal charges relating to his activities			1
they had spent months delving into the private lives of state prosecutors to establish if they had any ‘ personal peccadilloes ’ , in a desperate bid to defend @entity8 against claims of abusing scores of under - age girls at his @entity27 mansion			1
the billionaire 's lawyers persuaded prosecutors to sign a agreement which may have given prince @entity3 protection from prosecution , it is claimed the aggressive tactics culminated in an extraordinary ‘ non-prosecution agreement ’ being struck between @entity8 and prosecutors in september 2007			1
this halted any prospect of @entity3 being asked to answer questions on oath about his paedophile friend ’s antics			1
the agreement states : ‘ the @entity47 agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of @entity8 , including but not limited to @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53			1
’ many serious charges against @entity8 and any ‘ co-conspirators ’ were wiped out , in return for the billionaire pleading guilty to the relatively minor charge of soliciting an under - age girl for prostitution			1
after the accord had been signed , his lawyers fought to ensure it remained secret			0
they bombarded the @entity47 attorney ’s office in @entity27 with hundreds of pages of legal argument intended to prove that @entity8 ’s victims did not have any legal right to know a plea agreement had been struck			1
according to official documents , @entity8 ’s attorney @entity72 – a former deputy director of domestic policy at the @entity12 under @entity74 – sent a one - line email to the @entity77 on september 24 , 2007 : ‘ please do whatever you can to keep this from becoming public ’			1
on november 29 , 2007 , @entity72 called for more secrecy in a letter to the @entity27 state attorney : ‘ we do n’t understand the basis for your @entity77 ’s belief that it is appropriate for any letter to be sent to these individuals at this stage – before mr @entity8 has either entered a plea or been sentenced			1
’ @entity72 disputed the suggestion that the victims had the right to be heard at any plea or sentencing , adding : ‘ encouraging these individuals to participate in the state sentencing will have the effect of creating a media frenzy that will surely impact the sentence mr @entity8 received – precisely what your @entity77 promised to avoid			1
’ @entity3 may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a @entity107 - sanctioned business envoy			1
diplomatic immunity provides foreign diplomats protection from legal action in the country where they work			0
it is granted depending on an individual ’s rank and the level of immunity they need to carry out their duties			0
but diplomats are still expected to follow the laws of their host countries			0
in the @entity47 , several levels of immunity protecting foreign diplomats from legal action are granted			0
extradition lawyer @entity126 , who represented computer hacker @entity127 , said the prince could simply ignore any request to give evidence			0
‘ if proceedings are civil , extradition [ law ] does not apply , so he can just refuse to go , ’ she said			2
he could be compelled to give evidence ‘ only in criminal proceedings ’ , she added			1
if he refused to co-operate , however , the prince could be banned from entering the @entity47			0
it is not known whether @entity3 might be covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law			2
critics claim the deal was a scandalous cover - up – supported by the political establishment – to protect @entity8 and his influential circle of friends			1
@entity150 , the @entity47 attorney for southern @entity27 , who signed off on the non-prosecution agreement , has told of the aggressive tactics employed			1
in an open letter on the case four years ago , mr @entity150 said @entity8 had ‘ hired an army legal superstars ’ , citing @entity72 and @entity156 – lead prosecutor against president @entity157 in the @entity158			1
he added : ‘ the defence strategy was not limited to legal issues			0
defence counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families , looking for personal peccadilloes that might provide a basis for disqualification			0
defence counsel tried to disqualify at least two prosecutors			0
’ mr @entity150 said that ‘ some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher , adding : ‘ evidence that has come to light since 2007 may encourage that view			2
many victims have since spoken out , filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages			0
physical evidence has since been discovered			0
had these additional statements and evidence been known , the outcome may have been different			0
’ @entity8 ’s treatment during his year in prison , where he is reported to have had an easy ride , ‘ undermined the purpose of a jail sentence ’ and may ‘ encourage the view ’ that prosecutors should have been ‘ tougher ’ with him , mr @entity150 said			1
despite these comments , questions remain over why he and fellow @entity47 prosecutors agreed to provide a blanket immunity to men and women who had allegedly been involved in @entity8 ’s crimes			2
the disgraced financier has spent huge amounts of time , effort and money making sure there is no evidence to implicate third parties			0
the potential co-conspirators who have been named publicly have all kept quiet			1
former model @entity51 , who is referred to in the non-prosecution agreement , refused to answer any questions , including some about prince @entity3 , when deposed by lawyers representing @entity8 ’s victims			1
other key friends in his circle were equally reticent when asked on oath about his activities			2
if the allegations against any famous public figures are true , the agreement means the @entity47 government has provided them with an extraordinary get - out - of - jail free card			2
prince @entity3 pictured with @entity218 and @entity219 , right , in 2001 experts in criminal law in @entity47 still question how @entity8 ’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years			1
possibly the most critical question is whether the @entity226 was aware of any allegations involving prince @entity3 when the non-prosecution agreement was signed			1
@entity229 refuses to comment on whether the prince has ever been interviewed by the @entity226 – even as a witness – over @entity8 ’s liaisons with young girls			2
@entity8 was released in july 2009			2
in recent days , there have been claims that the prince lobbied on behalf of his disgraced friend for a reduced jail term			0
this has been denied by @entity229			0
a royal official said : ‘ the duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case			0
’ but more than a year after his release from jail , @entity8 was pictured walking in @entity247 ’s @entity246 with @entity3 – a show of loyalty from the prince which has repercussions to this day			1
envoy and minister left facing questions by @entity256 for the @entity257 former @entity259 ambassador to @entity261 sir @entity260 , pictured , faced questions tonight a former @entity259 ambassador and an ex-foreign office minister faced questions last night about what they discussed with prince @entity3 while @entity8 was under police investigation			1
the @entity3 met then - @entity259 ambassador to @entity261 sir @entity260 in september 2006 , one month after the billionaire pleaded not guilty to soliciting prostitution			1
official records show that he also had a meeting with then - @entity276 minister @entity275 in july 2005 , four months after @entity47 detectives launched their inquiry into @entity8			2
both sir @entity260 and dr @entity275 were in their roles at a time when @entity8 was enjoying a decadent life among global high society			2
royal sources insisted the prince did not interfere in the active legal case against the wealthy @entity47 paedophile			0
but he may have been concerned that he would himself face questioning about what – if anything – he knew of @entity8 ’s activities			2
@entity8 had previously attended a weekend party at the @entity295 ’s @entity294 estate in 2000 , and was a guest at the @entity295 ’s birthday party in @entity298 that same year			2
the prince also holidayed in @entity300 with the financier in 2001			0
as the @entity259 ’s special trade envoy until 2011 , prince @entity3 travelled widely around the world at this time promoting @entity259 businesses overseas – including in @entity47			2
but the topics of his conversations with @entity259 and @entity47 officials are unknown			0
he made three official trips to @entity47 while @entity8 was under investigation , including two in september 2006			0
one was to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in @entity247 , while the other was to @entity261			0
the prince visited again in february 2008 , five months after @entity47 federal prosecutors concluded a secret plea bargain with the financier that guaranteed he and any ‘ potential co-conspirators ’ would not face criminal charges			1
he started this third trip in @entity27 , the location of @entity8 ’s home where much of the alleged sexual abuse took place			0
there is nothing to suggest that the prince visited his friend or intervened on his behalf at this time			0
a royal official said : ‘ the duke would never interfere in an active legal case , and did not do so in this case			0
’ speaking from his home in @entity336 yesterday , dr @entity275 insisted he had not been at any meeting with the duke in july 2005 but could offer no explanation as to why the official records might be incorrect			0
he said he knew nothing about @entity8 ’s case , adding : ‘ i do remember meeting prince @entity3 once in @entity343 , but all he talked about was himself and what a good ambassador he was			1
’ sir @entity260 , who is now an aide to prince @entity347 , could not be reached for comment last night			0
