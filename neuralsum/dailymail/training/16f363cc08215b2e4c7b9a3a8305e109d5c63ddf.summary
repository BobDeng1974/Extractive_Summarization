she said : ' when i heard , my whole body went like jelly			0
you think if they did not hear the fox , then it could have run off with him			1
' mrs @entity34 , a care worker who has four children and nine grandchildren , said she had heard about fox attacks , but never dreamed it would happen to her family			1
' when it is this close to home , it is so frightening , ' she added ; ' but he is fine			1
he is a tough little boy			0
' she added : ' he is the sort of boy that falls over all the time and has a laugh about it afterwards			2
' but i just think it is so lucky they were still up at the time			2
' she said the family had now put a panel over the catflap to prevent the fox coming back after the incident at 2am on october 30			2
