it was late saturday afternoon at @entity1 when @entity2 and @entity3 finally caught up , having trawled through the bowels of the humming stadium complex to seek each other out			1
in these same corridors two years ago they celebrated the @entity11 's historic @entity10 championship victory , this most eyecatching player - coach relationship having done precisely what it was designed to do			1
the odd couple pairing â€“ @entity3 had never coached before - came to an end in @entity16 back in march , and now they were meeting for the first time since the 54 year - old @entity19 effectively walked out , citing the insufficient amount of time he was able to give to the job			1
having won @entity25 , you might have thought that @entity2 , who plays his first - round match today against @entity46 @entity45 , would have needed less of his mentor 's time			1
in fact , as @entity3 revealed , he believed the opposite was the case			2
and when you win a big tournament like that , it 's not easy sometimes , ' said @entity3			1
' some people find it easy , some people find it more difficult , and i 'm glad @entity2 found @entity42 who can give him the time he needs			1
' as revealed in @entity63 earlier this month , @entity42 has committed to 25 weeks travelling per year , while the @entity19 felt by the end he was only able to give barely half that			1
time out : the @entity19 coach decided he could no longer commit enough time to @entity2 's game this year ' i also felt that in my opinion @entity2 needed more time for the job to be done properly			1
even 20 weeks was going to be hard for me and i think he needed even more than that			2
' i did n't feel i could give @entity2 the time that he needed			1
that 's what it was and there was nothing else behind it , which is why i have come in today to see him and the guys , ' said @entity3 , who travelled in from his home in the neighbouring state of @entity86			1
when asked if it was also a factor that the exhilaration of winning the @entity89 , @entity10 and @entity25 would be hard to match he admits ' yeah , and that too , ' but also emphasises the changes in personal circumstances which led to the shock decision six months ago			1
' it was lots of little things combined			0
like playing more on the vets tour , and one of my daughters returned home ( he has five in all )			0
the youngest one is 16 and she had been away at horse riding school and but now she has come back to live with us			0
ready to go : @entity2 kicks off his @entity10 challenge on monday when he takes on @entity46 @entity45 focused : the @entity11 says he is in good physical shape ahead of his match with @entity45 ' my mum is now 79 and lives in @entity108 , i need to go more to the @entity19 than i used to			1
the planes are a pain in the arse			0
the places , the hotels - @entity112 was good , @entity114 was good , here it was alright			0
it was the smaller trips i did n't like			0
' all these things combined			0
and you know with @entity2 , after his surgery and after winning @entity25 and all that , i felt that if anything he needed more time rather than less time			1
' he admits that it was an awkward evening when they went out for dinner in @entity16 and he explained how he thought they needed to go their separate ways : ' yes it was difficult , we sat down and i said " look if you can come up with a way how it can work please let me know " but neither one of us could figure out a way of making it work			0
' some of the evenings watching him play were not easy either. , ' he joked			0
' yeah it 's never easy			2
as they say , everything good comes to an @entity137 was a different role , different experience and i 'm very grateful for that because i never thought i would be coaching , and of course @entity2 winning made it that much more enjoyable			2
' new team : @entity42 began coaching the @entity145 no 1 before this year 's @entity25 @entity3 was reluctant to be drawn on the subject of @entity42 , but did offer the suggestion that she works closely with @entity148 , @entity2 's ever present assistant coach who has been the cornerstone of his support team			1
' the person who knows @entity2 the best from the guys in @entity148 , he is fantastic			2
he certainly did n't get enough credit			0
people do n't understand how much i relied on @entity148			0
and i hope @entity42 relies on @entity148 as well because he knows @entity157 so well			2
' many times he would come to me and say " hey , you need to stop the practice			0
" and i would say " what ? he 's done ? he looks fine to me			2
" and @entity148 would say " no , he 's done			2
" more to come : @entity3 believes that with @entity42 coaching him @entity2 has the potential to win more slams ' and two or three minutes later he was done			1
so you hear that two or three times when he 's right and you start listening much better			0
' @entity3 does not rule out a return to coaching : ' maybe eventually if the situation is right			2
but the time now is not right			0
it would n't have worked if @entity2 had called me two years earlier , or if he had called me two years later			1
' and it has to be someone i feel i can offer something to			0
if it was @entity176 for example i am not going to be able to tell him how to hit a serve			0
' what he is convinced about is @entity2 's ability to win more slams : ' @entity2 's a great player			1
he can , simple as that			0
he is fully capable of winning more majors			0

@entity3 coached @entity2 to his only @entity10 victory two years ago
@entity19 coach left @entity2 's team because he could not commit enough time
@entity2 now works with @entity42 25 weeks of the year
@entity145 no 1 will begin his @entity10 on monday
