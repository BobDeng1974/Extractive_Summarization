we hope this settlement will mean we can now move on with our lives			0
' @entity67 , specialist illness lawyer at @entity14 , said : ' the fact that some of the passengers who suffered illness during and after trips on the @entity11 cruise ship in 2009 and 2010 still have continuing symptoms demonstrates the seriousness of what they have been through			1
