' you can loop ‘ em , roll ‘ em , spin ‘ em and side - slip them , ' says pilot , 90 by @entity4 published : 11:19 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 13:44 est , 6 october 2013 for most remaining @entity8 pilots , taking to the skies in a 1940s plane is a distant memory - one that is unlikely to ever be repeated			1
but , having not sat at the controls for more than seventy years , one 90 - year - old pilot is now regularly flying a @entity14 biplane - and is even doing aerobatic loop the loops in the skies above the @entity17			1
flight lieutenant @entity18 of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) has been flying in planes almost identical to the one he learnt to fly in when he was called up in 1942			1
' they ’re a very interesting and versatile aircraft			0
you can loop ‘ em , roll ‘ em , spin ‘ em and side - slip them			1
' the petrol tank is between the wings above you and it ’s a gravity feed			2
if you roll it the engine can stop so you have to go into a dive to get the fuel flowing again and the engine restarted			2
' ' @entity49 is very nostalgic			0
i remembered the controls instantly – it ’s like riding a bike			0
' back in time : @entity18 after being awarded his wings in 1944 after two years of training @entity57 , @entity58 said the daredevil often begs him to push the aircraft to its limits - and frequently asks if he can loop the plane			1
he said : ' he ’s got the lightest of touch			0
it ’s like with golf – it ’s technique not strength that counts			0
' he ’s so sharp he must have been an amazing pilot in his day			2
' mr @entity18 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , first went up for an experience flight in the 1940 @entity14 last @entity71 to celebrate his 90th birthday at @entity73 near @entity74 , @entity75			1
he now regularly returns to the airfield to take to the skies			2
his selection for flying training began in 1942 when he was nineteen - years - old , where he was put through tough medical , dental and physical tests			1
mr @entity18 said : ' we had to be good at maths too			1
i was asked to guess the length of a telegraph pole outside and how to work out the volume of the ink - well on the desk			2
i was lucky i ’d just finished school so it was n’t too hard			0
' the pilot was then put on a pilot navigator and @entity94 course and was sent to the @entity95 at @entity96 where his night vision was tested			2
at the initial training wing in @entity99 , mr @entity18 joined other new pilots learning meteorology , navigation , armament , clay pigeon shooting , signals and aircraft recognition			1
mr @entity18 said : ' after three months i was issued with my @entity111 [ inner flying suit ] , outer flying suit , helmet and goggles			1
' i was sent to grading school at @entity113 , near @entity114 , @entity115			1
in action : mr @entity18 flies a @entity117 - another training aircraft - over @entity119 in 1943 one of the boys : a photo showing @entity18 , bottom right , and his @entity123 flying boat crew ' i had a good instructor			1
he first took me out and taught me how to swing the prop to get it started , sometimes you had to tap the magneto with a stone			0
' the first time i flew a @entity14 it was scary			1
i ’d never flown before			0
it looked and felt very big			0
' when i first went solo my instructor said , " you ’ll be ok " but warned me it would feel lighter with just me in it			2
i was fifteen feet too high for my first landing and had to go round again			0
' our first flight was a half - hour familiarisation flight			1
then it was turns and landings			0
we learned to do two controlled spins in either direction and were checked by the @entity147 at eight and then twelve hours before our first solo flights			0
' those who did n’t pass these tests became navigators and bomb aimers			0
' in training : @entity18 's ' you are going to be a pilot ' booklet , given to all trainees , from 1942 he continued : ' i was posted to @entity159 into a unit for overseas postings			1
i nearly went to @entity162 but was ill with shingles for a week so took the next draft to @entity119			1
' i sailed from @entity165 to @entity166 on @entity167			0
she was painted @entity169 and we zig - zagged our way across the @entity172 unescorted			0
we were used to city black - outs and @entity166 looked amazing all lit up			0
' we caught a train to @entity119 and i began more training flying @entity176			1
we learned formation , night and cross-country flying , circuits and landings , instruments and aerobatics			0
' ' like riding a bike ' : my @entity18 is now a regular flyer after first returning to the skies last year daredevil : mr @entity18 asks to push the plane to its limit and always suggests doing rolls , his instructor says he began flying @entity191 out of @entity192 where he passed out 2nd of 30 pilots and was awarded his wings			1
he then trained on @entity196 and practiced monitoring shipping movements in @entity199 harbour in a twin - engined @entity200 from his base on @entity203			0
mr @entity18 said : ' later in 1944 i was given the chance to go back to @entity205 to fly @entity206			1
these were giant flying boats – much bigger than a @entity208			0
based in @entity209 , @entity210 i was second pilot , part of a crew of nine			2
' the war ended and these aircraft became surplus to requirements			0
i flew one to @entity216 in @entity217 to be scrapped			0
' after the war the pilot returned to being a fitter , later worked for @entity221 and then went into business for himself			2
the @entity14 is a 1930s biplane , a fixed - wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other , designed by @entity227			1
it was derived from the @entity229 model in response to @entity231 calls for a training aircraft			0
from the outset , the @entity14 proved to be an ideal trainer - simple and cheap to own and maintain			1
however , they were not the easiest to fly as control movements required a sure hand due to slow control inputs			0
instructors often preferred these flight characteristics because of the effect of ' weeding ' out the inept student pilot			2
the @entity14 was operated by the @entity19 and others as a primary trainer until it was replaced by the @entity245 in 1952			1
many other nations used the @entity14 in both military and civil applications , and it remains in widespread use as a recreational aircraft in many countries			2
it is still occasionally used as a primary training aircraft , particularly for those pilots wanting to gain experience before moving on to other larger aircraft .			2

@entity18 , part of the @entity19 , was called up in 1942 and learnt to fly in the magnificent @entity14 biplane in @entity115
got his wings in @entity119 in 1944 after two years of training
returned to the skies last year for an experience flight at @entity73 near @entity74 , @entity75
is now a frequent flier and begs his instructor to let him do acrobatics
