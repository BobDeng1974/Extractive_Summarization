by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 16 july 2013 if really you want to cut your grass in a hurry , @entity3 engineers have created just the job – the 130mph lawn mower			1
it has been specially adapted from a conventional lawn tractor by the firm ’s top @entity12 race technicians who have turned it into a super-charged blade - runner			1
and with performance that will propel it from rest to 60mph in under four seconds it will be a match for many supercars and outpace most family runarounds – if you ’re brave enough to sit on it			1
and it features exclusively in the august special edition of the latest @entity39 magazine to be published on wednesday july 17 as part of its focus on the @entity43 , where the @entity39 team have dubbed it the ‘ @entity24 ’			1
@entity39 ’s chief road tester @entity45 , who took the lawn mower for a spin ahead of their in - house racing driver , the @entity51 , said : ‘ in a @entity39 world littered with stupid stunts , driving a 130mph mower ranks up there as being one of the more unhinged			1
’ the @entity24 is based around a conventional @entity3 lawn - mowing mini tractor costing around £ 4,000 , though that family of mowers starts at around £ 2,000			1
@entity3 ’s @entity60 engineers – which runs their touring car race squad - spent three months adapting it to make it the cutting edge of @entity66 racing lawn mowers			1
first they ripped out the standard pedestrian 614cc engine and replaced it with a far more powerful 1000cc engine from a @entity70 motor bike			2
it develops 109brake horse - power – roughly the same as a @entity73			1
they fitted a hi - tech ' spaceframe chassis ' like a proper racing car and converted part of the skirt - like grass collector at the back to contain the fuel tank and various radiators			1
the driver is nevertheless particularly vulnerable			2
there ’s no seatbelt - the idea being that you are thrown clear in an accident - no traction control , no airbag , no @entity90 anti-lock brakes and no protective roll cage - so you wo n’t see it on the road			1
but it does have a petite fire extinguisher strapped to the rear wing			2
souped up : the @entity24 is based around a @entity3 lawn - mowing mini tractor costing around £ 4,000 , but @entity3 's @entity60 engineers spent three months adapting it to celebrate their re-entry to @entity33 @entity100 provided by @entity39 top speed is 133mph and it will accelerate from rest to 62mph in around roughly four seconds – performance figures to rival many supercars			1
but the whole machine , complete with terrified driver , weighs just 205kg , which gives it a tremendous power to weight ratio ( 532bhp/tonne ) which is higher than a super-fast but super light @entity111 ( at 520bhp/tonne )			2
cutting grass is indeed still possible thanks to two spinning 4,000rpm electric motors with metal brake cables			0
but ton - up speeds are n’t possible when you ’re mowing because with the cutting deck attached , the ground clearance is about a centimetre			2
the tyres are borrowed from a racing quad - bike and are reported to be ‘ as soft as marshmallows ’			2
@entity39 road - tester mr @entity45 explained : ' apparently , if they were any harder , there ’d be so little grip that the mower would swap ends as soon as you got on the throttle			2
' he added : ' the noise is ridiculous – like the offspring of a nuclear explosion and a machine gun – and it ’s spitting small blue and orange flames from the side - mounted exhaust			2
' @entity24 features exclusively in the august special edition of the latest @entity39 magazine , whose writers took it for a spin describing the sensation riding this ‘ flame - spitting garden implement ’ on a race - track he said : ‘ it feels incredible			1
' this must be a bit like how @entity149 felt before he went through the sound barrier in @entity151 for the first time			0
' he said : ' it fires up the pit straight with such ferocity that i ’m pretty certain i left some of my internal organs behind			0
there is absolutely no slack			0
instant power , instant gear changes			0
i ’m through the first corner in a blur			0
‘ but , despite all the noise			0
it ’s actually fairly easy to drive			0
you ’re locked into the tiny seat so tightly that you can feel every single bump			0
the steering is n’t as brutally sharp as i thought it might be			0
’ he noted : ' towards the end of the lap , my confidence gets the better of me , and i decide to see what ’s really possible			0
we hit 100mph , and i must admit to a fleeting thought at this point – if this goes wrong , quite a lot of pain is n’t far away			0
but the mower and i survive , and as i round the final corner , the red @entity3 popping and banging like an angry firework			1
’ @entity3 spokesman @entity188 said it created the ton - up mower to comemorate its re-entry with @entity35 into f1 racing from 2015 and its move to new @entity194 in @entity36			1
‘ we wanted something a bit different to celebrate so we thought a 130mph lawn mower would be jus the job , ' he said			0
he added : ' we still still do sell conventional versions of this lawn mower			0
they may not do 100mph plus , but they will cut your grass and keep your garden looking smart			0

@entity3 's @entity24 goes from 0 - 60 in just four seconds
