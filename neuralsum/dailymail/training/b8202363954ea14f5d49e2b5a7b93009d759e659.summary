by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 18:49 est , 10 october 2012 six penguins at @entity3 have died of malaria , it emerged yesterday			2
the birds were struck down by an avian version of the disease after being bitten by mosquitoes during the summer			1
experts blamed the tragedy on wet and muggy weather that prompted an explosion of the insects in the capital			1
the zoo remains open as usual			2
the penguins involved were all @entity30 , from @entity31 and @entity32 , although all breeds are equally susceptible to the disease			0
the penguins are likely to have become ill after a mosquito bit a native bird with the disease and then passed it on to them			1
it can not be passed directly from bird to bird or to humans			1
' @entity48 malaria is endemic in the @entity50 ’s wild bird population , ' @entity45 , a spokeswoman for the zoo said			1
tragic : the birds , pictured at @entity3 last winter , have got a low resistance to the virus ' a mosquito would have to bite one of these birds with the virus and then pass it on to a penguin			1
each penguin must have been bitten individually - they can not pass it to each other			0
huge draw : the penguins are world famous , pictured here in 1937 with the @entity66 and @entity67 ' it is very hard to spot physical symptoms before a penguin dies			0
they might suddenly go off their food or be lethargic but the process is not a long one			0
' the zookeepers are feeding the penguins at breakfast with the medicine @entity77 which is also used to treat the disease in humans			1
' the zoo treats its colony against avian - malaria as a matter of routine so it is unfortunate that these six penguins caught it			0
' but the numbers of mosquitoes were very high this summer because the weather was very wet and muggy - just the conditions they thrive in			1
' so the keepers and vets have decided to increase the penguins ’ preventative anti-malarial medicine			0
' there is absolutely no risk to the public because avian malaria is a completely different strain to the human varieties			2
' we are keeping a close eye on all the other penguins to look for any sudden changes in their behaviour and at the moment they are all perfectly fit and healthy			0
' zoo keepers have set up mosquito traps in the penguin enclosure and are spraying lavender oil - a mosquito repellant - in the nest boxes			0
they have also planted lavender which the birds use to build their nests .			2

the strain can not be passed on to humans , experts say
*58* remaining birds have been given *special* drugs to *protect* them
@entity50 *'s* record wet summer blamed for helping mosquitos thrive
