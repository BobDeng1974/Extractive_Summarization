one @entity7 restaurant that specialises in @entity9 cuisine is spearheading a filthy new food fad and has launched a full course menu of dishes all made with dirt			1
courses include potato starch and dirt soup and dirt dressed salad ... there 's even a dirt ice cream			1
getting the dirt on a new food trend : potato starch and dirt soup served in a shot glass with slice of black truffle not only does this sound like a torturous exercise , but to eat this restaurant 's dirty offerings you 'll have to make reservations at least a week in advance due to high demand			1
and you 'll also have to fork out £ 70 for the pleasure			0
as odd and lethal as this menu sounds , the well - known @entity9 restaurant that boasts it as a hot new thing swears that the the dirt is made with harmless ' coffee grinds and palm fiber ' , as reported by @entity43			1
supplied by soil company @entity45 , the dirt product was previously discarded as surplus , but now they sell it as a novel and eco-friendly compost - safe for human consumption			1
bringing a whole new meaning to wash before use : mmm , dirty salad dirt - smothered vegetables : the writer was impressed by the taste of the dishes the chic restaurant in @entity7 ’s @entity60 district , @entity61 , is apparently famous for using high - quality seafood and produce from @entity65 ’s @entity64 region			1
however , their new menu is created around the last ingredient any foodie would consider a luxury			0
the chef at @entity61 recently won a tv cooking show battle with a sauce made with dirt ... but is the menu worth getting down and dirty for ? @entity43 shared their experience with @entity77 : ' the first course : a potato starch and dirt soup			1
it arrived in a shot glass looking so dark brown , it was almost black			0
it definitely looked like it had dirt in it			2
a slice of black truffle was balanced on top , and the staff instructed us to take a bite of it and then try the soup			2
so we did … and it was divine ! there was n’t a dirty flavor at all			0
instead , this simple soup went down smoothly with just a hint of potato flavor , '' the rim of the shot glass was dusted with salt like a margarita , so after the initial saltiness , your mouth filled with the mild flavor of the soup			0
the dish impressed us more with the chef ’s skill than with the potential of the unusual ingredient , though , ' they added			0
there 's muddy risotto on my fork : minerals of the sea and of the land indeed the fish looks good , shame about the rice : it 's fit for consumption and a novelty , so would you try it ? the restaurant also serves a salad of grilled eggplant , tomato and turnips with dirt dressing and a fine powder made from ground popcorn			2
also on the menu is a dish called ' minerals of the sea and minerals of the land ' - clams , a layer of sediment , dirt risotto and sauteed sea bass and burdock root , and for dessert there 's dirt ice cream with dirt gratin and ' cleansing ' dirt mint tea			1
the writer was impressed overall : ' with its mild cuisine , sweet desserts and refreshing tea , the course had the flavor and modulation you would expect from @entity61 ’s talented chef			0
' as to why the meal did n’t taste at all of dirt , that is likely due to the dirt itself			0

not quite @entity171 's is it ? ice cream infused with a fine blend of ... dirt dirt gratin : @entity177 topped dessert , while displeasing to the eye in the first place , is n't helped by its ingredients hot chocolate ? you 'll be in for a surprise if that 's what you think this ' cleansing ' mint tea is			2
