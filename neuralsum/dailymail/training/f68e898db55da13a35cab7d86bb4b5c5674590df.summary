by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 3 may 2013 would you eat a sandwich four months past its sell by date ? of course not , but you are probably wearing make - up past its expiry date right now			1
most women only replace their make - up when it runs out , however long that might take and a new survey has highlighted that the majority of women are unaware of a beauty product 's shelf life , putting them at risk of anything from a painful eye infection to a disfiguring skin complaint			1
when questioned 78 per cent of women had no idea that their make - up had a shelf life at all			1
and even though 22 per cent of respondents were aware of their product 's expiry dates , a shocking 82 per cent said they still kept the products well past their use by date			1
best before : a staggering 78 per cent of women are unsure of their make - up 's shelf life , meaning they risk infection furthermore , when asked to stipulate why they kept their products past their sell by date , a third of the women polled admitted that they ‘ did n’t want to waste the product ’ , while 26 per cent said they ‘ could n’t afford to replace it ’			1
a canny 18 per cent of respondents said they believed that the expiry date was just ‘ a ploy ’ to get consumer to spend more while 11 per cent said the product was still usable even after the use by date			2
biggest offender : @entity51 is the top item that women would use past its use by date , even though it can cause painful eye infections @entity51 and eyeshadow were the top two products that women were most likely to use after their use by date			1
@entity69 shadow @entity67 lotion @entity65 cream @entity63 a spokesman for @entity71 , who carried out the research , said : ' i was quite shocked to see how many women used beauty products way past their sell by date			2
' although it may be costly to throw out expired makeup , especially if they are designer brands , these expiry dates are put in place for a reason			0
' if you have too many products that are close to expiring , then perhaps you should cut down on your beauty spending habits			0
at the end of the day , you are only throwing away your money ! ' dr @entity90 – cosmetic dermatologist , @entity91 said : ' all quality cosmeceutical skincare products should be used within 6 months of opening			0
' the big problem is that these products contain advanced ingredients such as @entity98 and @entity99 that lose their potency if left to oxygenate over time			0
' meaning they simply wo n’t do what they should			0
this is particularly important when using a moisturiser with @entity106 as you are expecting it to protect you in the sun – it wo n’t ! ' another point to mention is that through the oxygenation process the products may separate which can cause allergic reactions on the skin			0
' @entity116 , beauty editor at online cosmetics shop @entity117 , added : ' old make - up can become a breeding ground for bacteria , especially eye products which if shared or kept for a long time can spread infections			1
so it 's not just a fashion thing			0
' be ruthless and honest with yourself and do n’t be a hoarder ! ask yourself : when was the last time you used it ? does it suit you ? has it dried up / smell funny / or look odd ? and do n't forget to give your make - up brushes a thorough clean and throw out any overused sponges as these harbour bacteria like you would n’t believe			2
' i keep a bottle of @entity139 to keep on top of it			0
' to keep my make - up bag fresh and free of nasty bugs , i swap over my products regularly			2

78 per cent of women have no idea that their make - up has a shelf life
@entity51 is top product women use past the use by date
expired make - up can cause infections , *rashes* and blemishes
