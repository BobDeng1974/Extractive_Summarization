by @entity0 @entity1 : 22:09 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:26 est , 18 december 2013 ' manipulation ' : @entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 , spoke at the @entity7 to dispute @entity8 chief evidence the police watchdog has told @entity11 that it is ' almost certain that some manipulation is going on ' in the recording of crime statistics by officers			1
@entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 , told the @entity7 ' in anything that gets measured ' there is an ' incentive , resisted by many , to manipulate the process to make your own performance look good '			1
and mr @entity4 , the first chief inspector of constabulary to come from a non-policing background , disputed evidence given by the chief of the @entity8 , commissioner sir @entity28 , who claimed inspectors lauded his force 's crime data as ' competent and reliable '			1
his comments come after whistle - blowing police constable @entity34 told the @entity36 officers routinely massage crime statistics to boost their forces ' performance figures			0
asked by @entity7 chair @entity42 mp if there is manipulation occurring , mr @entity4 , a former rail regulator and lawyer , said : ' it is almost certain that some manipulation going on			1
the question is where , how much , how severe			0
' he earlier added : ' the fact is in anything that gets measured , once those who are being measured , whose performance are being measured , work out how the system works , there 's an incentive , resisted by many , to manipulate the process as to make your own performance look good			0
' mr @entity42 said sir @entity28 and sir @entity62 , the president of the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , had not told the @entity7 earlier this month that they believe fiddling of statistics is currently occurring			2
mr @entity4 said : ' sir @entity28 gave evidence , i think to this committee on december 3 , where he said that in 2012 @entity5 inspected the @entity8 and found their figures in terms of crime recording were " competent and reliable "			1
' i 've written to sir @entity28 about this because what @entity5 in fact said was that it looked at " 244 incidents logged by the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , 30 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised , while in overall terms the @entity8 continues to improve its crime and incident data quality , this indicates that crime and @entity76 ( anti-social behaviour ) data recorded in @entity77 gives some cause for concern "			1
dispute : chief of the @entity8 , commissioner sir @entity28 , claimed inspectors lauded his force 's crime data as ' competent and reliable ' but mr @entity4 has written to him to dispute this ' so there is a big difference between " some cause of concern " and " competent and reliable "			1
i have not yet received sir @entity28 's response			2
' mr @entity42 asked the chief inspector if he was still ' very concerned '			0
mr @entity4 added : ' i 'd just like him to explain the disparity i 'd referred to			2
but with crime recording , some people will call it fiddling , some people will call it honest mistakes , some people will call it the perfectly legitimate exercise of professional judgment			0
' asked what he would call it , the chief inspector said : ' it depends on the circumstances of individual cases			0
' mr @entity34 - who is currently awaiting disciplinary proceedings - also told the @entity36 that serious offences including rape and child sex abuse are being recorded as ' crime - related incidents ' or ' no crimes '			0
and a former chief inspector in @entity126 told the same hearing about techniques used by officers to improve performance figures known as ' cuffing ' , ' nodding ' , ' skewing ' and ' stitching ' .			0

@entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 , spoke to *mps*
