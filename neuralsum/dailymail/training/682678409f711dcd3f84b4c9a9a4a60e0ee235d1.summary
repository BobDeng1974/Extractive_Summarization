by @entity1 reporter published : 14:39 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 4 april 2013 @entity3 marks the northern tip of @entity5 , @entity2 is in @entity6 and the @entity7 is in @entity8			0
that 's the view of millions of @entity5 whose lack of geographical knowledge was highlighted in new research			0
the report also showed how little people know about other famous areas of @entity5 like the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
more than a third of those under 30 thought @entity3 was in the north when really it marks the southern-most tip of the country nearly one in 10 people believe the @entity16 is nearest to @entity25 , while one in five think the @entity17 is in the @entity26			1
a poll of 1,000 people by @entity29 found a woeful lack of general knowledge among @entity5 's young people			1
more than a third of those under 30 thought @entity3 was in the north when really it marks the westernmost tip of the @entity38 mainland			0
and a north - south divide really does exist with two in three @entity40 unsure about which towns and cities are nearest to the @entity16			1
a reliance on modern technology such as @entity47 maps , satellite navigation and internet route finders is being blamed for significant numbers of people having a blinkered view of their country			2
technology such as sat nav , @entity47 maps and route finder websites mean that people can almost point and go these days , without having to know the geography of the country social network sites such as @entity61 and @entity62 also mean that people often keep in touch with friends without travelling to visit them			2
the poll quizzed people aged 16 to 60 - plus on the location of some famous areas of @entity5 , how long it took to travel between some cities and typical train journey times			2
a total of 45 per cent of people did not know that @entity75 in @entity76 is nearer to the @entity16 than @entity77 , @entity25 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
eight per cent thought it was nearest to @entity25 , five per cent said @entity79 and two per cent even said @entity78 in @entity84			1
ignorance about the @entity16 location was highest among under 30s with 54 per cent not knowing it was nearest to @entity75			1
and @entity40 were least knowledgeable about the @entity16 with only 34 per cent knowing its location			2
nearly half of those questioned ( 47 per cent ) did not know that @entity91 in @entity8 was the most northerly city compared to @entity93 , @entity78 , @entity94 and @entity80			0
that figure rose to 54 per cent among people aged under 30 , said @entity29			1
a third ( 33 per cent ) of those polled did not know that the @entity17 was in the @entity98 , placing it in the @entity26 ( 21 per cent ) , @entity100 ( nine per cent ) and @entity101 ( three per cent )			1
while 68 per cent correctly said the @entity7 is in @entity102 and @entity103 , 12 per cent placed it in @entity8 , seven per cent in @entity104 or north @entity84 and six per cent in @entity105			0
more than one in five @entity5 thought @entity2 divided either @entity103 and @entity6 , @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity38 and @entity84 and even north and south @entity109			0
a total of 78 per cent correctly said it was nearest to the border between @entity38 and @entity8			2
while 87 per cent rightly said @entity3 was in the south of the @entity5 , 13 per cent said it was in the north , rising to a third of those aged under 30			0
more than seven in 10 brits thought a typical train journey between @entity81 and @entity109 took between three and five hours , compared to the real time of just over two hours			0
just 21 per cent of people correctly said the train journey time from @entity123 in the @entity16 to @entity109 was three hours			1
twelve per cent thought the journey was more than five hours			0
six in 10 people did not know that trains can reach speeds of 125mph on journeys between @entity109 and @entity81			1
@entity129 , communications director of @entity29 , said : ' our research shows that significant numbers of people in @entity5 are vague about the location of some of our most famous landmarks			2
' but technology such as sat nav , google maps and route finder websites mean that people can almost point and go these days , without having to know the geography of the country			0
' in the end , there is no better way of discovering where everywhere is than to get out there and enjoy our great landscape this year			0
' @entity151 , marketing director of tourism group @entity152 , said : ' whether it 's heading to @entity153 to take in a match at @entity155 before visiting an exhibition at the @entity157 , or wandering the @entity158 in @entity159 ahead of dining at one of the city 's @entity162 starred restaurants , visitors are just a train ride away from discovering all that is great about @entity5			0

nearly one in 10 people believe the @entity16 is nearest to @entity25
while one in five think the @entity17 is in the @entity26
the poll of 1,000 people was carried out by @entity29
