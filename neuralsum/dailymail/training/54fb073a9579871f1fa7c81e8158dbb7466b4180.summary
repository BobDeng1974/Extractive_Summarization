a man has lost an incredible 11st and transformed his life after his wife casually signed them up to @entity4 after a night out			1
@entity6 's , 39 , from @entity7 , story is made all the more remarkable by the fact he achieved his weight loss while in his job at a fast food company			1
rather than a eureka moment or dramatic event , @entity6 's weight loss began in an almost accidental way			1
@entity6 has managed to drop from 23st ( left ) to a trim 10st 7lbs ( right , with his wife @entity16 , who also lost weight alongside @entity6 ) through a calorie controlled diet @entity6 was out for dinner with his wife @entity21 , 39 , to celebrate her birthday when she casually mentioned that a voucher they had received for @entity4 membership was about to expire , and that she planned to sign them both up			1
that spur of the moment decision began a year long journey which saw both @entity21 and @entity6 totally transform their diets and lives , with the result that @entity6 dropped over 11st ( 154lb ) in weight			1
@entity6 struggled with his weight throughout his childhood , often suffering from lung infections meaning sports were difficult for him			1
‘ i had asthma and my father smoked and i always had bronchitis			2
consequently , running was n’t easy and i was never overly good at sports			2
so there was just food			1
the way we ate as a family was always a meat , a potato and then a starchy vegetable covered in butter and massive portions			2
‘ my father , my mother and my sister were all overweight			2
we were just a fat family			2
we were your typical @entity58 fat family and i was just terrified of it			0
’ @entity6 and @entity16 , with their son , before they both embarked on their weight loss journey @entity6 and @entity21 , pictured here with their son @entity66 , were previously eating a high fat diet , which included a lot of red meat , dairy products , bread and chips although @entity6 grew up and found love with @entity21 , welcoming a son , @entity66 , now 9 , and finding a fulfilling job working in the catering industry , his weight continued to be an issue for him			1
‘ i worked in hotels , restaurants and i was constantly around food			1
i never put myself in a position to be successful with weight loss			2
part of my issue was not just what i ate , but how much of it i ate			0
i had no self - control , i would n’t have one sandwich , i ’d have two			2
there was no sense of portioning or restraint			0
‘ my wife and i always wanted to lose weight but we just never had the self - motivation			1
we always said it would be great and then never did anything about it			0
’ at 6ft @entity6 , who works at @entity100 , had reached 23st ( 322lb ) when his wife signed him up to @entity4			1
when @entity16 signed them both up to the slimming group after her birthday meal , @entity6 did not hold much hope for success , but found the gradual reduction of calories and online services offered meant the process was not as daunting as he had expected			1
despite his colossal weight loss , @entity6 says the main effect has been the way those around him have reacted to his drastically changed appearance ( @entity6 before his weight loss , left , and now , right ) ‘ when the weight started coming off , i thought , i can do this			1
what helped for me was that fruits and unprocessed vegetables are zero points so you can snack on those all the time			0
i can eat those all day			0
' i started out and i said ok – let me get below 300lbs			0
then i said - let me hit 270			0
' then i thought , i can lose 100lb			0
’ the family swapped their high fat diet , which included a lot of red meat , dairy products , bread and chips , for a largely home - made , unprocessed food with lots of fruit and vegetables			1
as the weight began to fall off , @entity6 was able to become more active and began running despite not finding the diet too much of a struggle , @entity6 says having the support of his wife , who was following the plan alongside him , was a huge help			1
i did n’t do the meetings but i had my wife			2
we had the same foods			0
we could talk to each other and share ideas			0
there was n’t bad foods in the pantry			2
‘ finally , when we got it , the weight loss came easily and it was n’t as much of a challenge as i thought it would be			2
it also helped us get athletic			0
being lighter enabled us to run , to get out and be more active			0
’ @entity6 , pictured with his son @entity66 after completing the the @entity162 race , says he now realises that he was not happy when he was overweight but despite losing 11st ( 154lb ) - half his body weight , - @entity6 says much of the change has been a shift in the perception others had of him			1
‘ i ’ve learned is that you never really see yourself as heavy as you are and you never really see yourself as thin as you are			0
you need someone outside to give you that perspective			0
' people i worked with after i lost the weight said to me , “ man , i was worried about you , you would be out of breath walking down the corridor			1
” and i just had no idea			0
i chose not to see that about myself			0
’ now maintaining his new low weight and enjoying a new active and healthy lifestyle , @entity6 says that , despite slightly falling into his diet by accident , he realises he was n’t happy at his former size			1
' i look back and see i was angry			0
i did n’t realise it , but i was angry			0
i was n’t comfortable in my own skin and if you ’re not ok with yourself then you ’ll make everyone else around you miserable			0
