the latest research shows that being married for less than seven years and in your forties makes you most likely to have a secret fling the survey investigated which ages , professions , regions , length of marriage and other lifestyle factors are most prolific in people who cheat on their partner			2
for both men and women , more than half had been married for less than seven years before they thought about seeking an affair , with eight to 14 years of marriage being the second most category and the numbers steadily declining the longer a couple had been together			1
men who are self - employed are most likely to have a secret fling followed by those in executive management			0
for women , the most common cheaters are among housewives , followed by secretaries			0
there also seemed to be a link between affairs and how much people earn			0
below £ 20,000 was the most common salary bracket ( 50 per cent for women and 29 per cent for men ) and between £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 was second most common			1
for women , it 's their naughty forties when their eyes wander but for misbehaving men it 's their fifties for men only though , there was another spike in those who earn over £ 60,000			1
for women , it is during their forties when their eyes wander , with 24 per cent of women looking for an affair aged between 41 - 45 and 21 per cent aged 46 - 50			1
for their male counterparts 19 per cent of cheaters were aged between 46 - 50 , 18 per cent were aged 51 - 55 and 16 per cent between 41 - 45			0

the @entity1 outnumbered all the other regions by a long way ( 39 per cent of women and 34 per cent of men )			1
the @entity91 was next most common for men and the @entity93 came in second place for unfaithful women			2
@entity96 and @entity10 were the regions with the lowest number of forbidden liaisons			2
having two children , it seems , does n’t bode well on fidelity with 37 per cent of philandering women and 30 per cent of philandering men having two children with their established partner			2
but having none at all also seems to lend itself towards forbidden trysts ( 30 per cent of men and 28 per cent of women embarking on affairs were child free )			0
according to maritalaffair.co.uk , which conducted the research , the most overwhelmingly common reason for cheating , which out beat any other category five-fold , was lack of intimacy			0
while many may not openly admit so in front of their partners , a significant majority of both sexes agreed that an affair could save a marriage .			0
