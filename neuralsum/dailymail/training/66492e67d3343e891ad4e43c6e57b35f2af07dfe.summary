surgery : @entity1 had a preventative mastectomy but a survey found one in four @entity5 women are afraid to find out if they are at risk @entity5 women at risk of ovarian cancer have been accused of ‘ burying their heads in the sand ’ after a quarter of respondents to a new survey admitted they would be ‘ too scared ’ to undergo dna tests to find out whether they had a 50 per cent genetic chance of developing the disease			1
in the same survey , one in three claimed to have a family history of the disease , but 40 per cent said they had taken no action yet to find out their own genetic risk			1
ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynaecological cancer , killing one woman every two hours in @entity5			1
there are more than 7,000 new @entity5 diagnoses each year , a third of which are caught at a late stage , due to lack of awareness of the symptoms earlier on			1
almost one in five cases of ovarian cancer are due to a mutation in the @entity40 / 2 gene , which also increases the chances of developing breast cancer to 87 per cent and is the cause of one in ten cases			1
genetic testing is offered on the @entity46 to any woman with a family history of either disease who requests it , and now campaigners want screening to be offered to all patients at the point of diagnosis			1
many who test positive for the brca gene mutation choose to have preventative surgery – a mastectomy ( surgical removal of the breasts ) and removal of the female reproductive organs – which reduces the risk of disease to ‘ almost nothing ’ , according to experts			2
in 2013 , actress @entity1 became the highest - profile star to undergo a preventative mastectomy after discovering she carried the brca gene			0
@entity1 has said she is considering surgery to remove her ovaries			0
in the months after her revelation , referrals for genetic testing in @entity5 doubled to 4,847 compared with 1,981 referrals in the same period in 2012 , according to figures from @entity80			0
whether the ‘ @entity1 effect ’ has been sustained remains to be seen , as the @entity5 @entity82 has not released up - to - date figures			0
@entity84 released their figures ahead of @entity86 this month and are calling for women to be ‘ brca aware ’ by completing an online risk calculator on their website , ovarian.org.uk			0
@entity92 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ knowing that you ’re at greater risk of developing cancer can be frightening but the benefits of knowing far outweigh a temptation to bury your head in the sand			0
’ there ’s no screening tool or routine testing for ovarian cancer , as there is with breast cancer , and symptoms are often confused , by both women and doctors , for other conditions			2
of the women surveyed , more than half were unaware that persistent stomach pains and bloating could be a sign , while 33 per cent said they did n’t know of any symptoms associated with ovarian cancer			2
‘ we want women to know there is support and information given before and after genetic testing , and surgery is not the only option , ’ added @entity92 .			0
