@entity26 was told that mr @entity3 's fingernails were in a constant poor condition and he lost a lot of feeling and sensation in them			1
@entity34 dr @entity33 told the hearing that mr @entity3 would probably not realise the severity of the condition because of this			1
' @entity3 ’s nails were always in bad condition , ' said the doctor			2
' it was likely they were often bleeding when he came to the doctors			2
' mr @entity3 , who was diabetic , had also been treated for anxiety and depression in the years leading up to his death , the inquest was told			1
he underwent surgery to remove the tip of his finger eight days after being admitted into hospital			1
before this he was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was monitored by medical staff daily to see if his condition improved as he expressed that he did n’t want to lose his finger			0

consultant hand and orthopaedic surgeon mr @entity64 said he was as shocked by his patient ’s sudden death on september 22 last year as the family were			2

' @entity97 always strives to provide safe , effective and compassionate care to all patients			0
' it is clear from the evidence given at the inquest that mr @entity3 received a high standard of treatment throughout the time he was under our care			1
' recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity107 said : ' this is a death of great sadness to everybody that somebody in this situation could just die so suddenly			0

' @entity146 is another name for blood poisoning and refers to a bacterial infection of the blood , whereas sepsis , which can affect the whole body including organs , can also be caused by viral or fungal infections			0
the life - threatening illness is caused by the body overreacting to an infection , setting off a series of reactions that can lead to inflammation and blood clotting			0
symptoms usually develop quickly and include : in severe cases patients may also feel dizzy when they stand up , be confused or disorientated and suffer from nausea and vomiting			0
although anybody can develop sepsis from a minor infection , those with a medical condtion that weakens their immune system , who are already in hospital with a serious illness and those who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident are more at risk			2
severe sepsis occurs when the body ’s response to infection has started to interfere with the function of vital organs , such as the heart , kidneys , lungs or liver , while septic shock occurs in severe cases of sepsis , when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level , preventing your vital organs from receiving enough oxygenated blood			2
if it is not treated , sepsis can progress from uncomplicated sepsis to septic shock and can eventually lead to multiple organ failure and death			2
severe sepsis and septic shock are considered medical emergencies and normally require admission to an intensive care unit , where the body ’s organs can be supported while the infection is treated			0
because of problems with vital organs , people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill , and approximately 30 - 50per cent will die as a result of the condition			0
it is estimated that every year in the @entity222 there are over 30,000 cases of severe sepsis , and the number seems to be rising			0
