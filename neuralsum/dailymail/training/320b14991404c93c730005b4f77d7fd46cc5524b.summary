@entity1 boss @entity0 has cleared @entity2 of all blame after the @entity5 goalkeeper was allegedly assaulted in the street by another @entity8 player on monday night			1
@entity2 had been out for a meal with his wife and a friend in @entity13 ’s fashionable @entity12 when the incident is said to have occurred			1
and on wednesday night @entity15 released a statement revealing they have commenced an internal investigation into the conduct of two of their players following information received by the club			1
they refused to make any further comment			1
goalkeeper @entity2 , sporting a black eye , is put through his paces in training earlier this week the @entity5 keeper was pictured with a woolly hat over the wounded eye ahead of thursday 's match despite being taken to hospital for medical attention after suffering facial bruising , the 32 - year - old trained at @entity36 this week and is set to take his place in the squad which faces @entity40 @entity39 in the @entity41 at @entity42 on thursday			1
speaking about the matter before the @entity46 club ’s statement was released , @entity0 said he had no issue whatsoever with his player socialising on the night in question			1
and the @entity50 was convinced his player had absolutely no reason to reproach himself for anything that had happened			1
‘ he is fine , ’ @entity0 declared			2
‘ of course he was a bit scared about this but everything is good now			2
he has trained well the last couple of days , so he is ready for tomorrow			2
‘ i talked to him , of course , about what happened			2
it is a police case now , i hope they can make it right and we just have to wait and see			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 has cleared @entity2 of all blame after he was allegedly assaulted in the street @entity1 goalkeepers @entity2 ( left ) and @entity66 keep warm during a brisk session earlier this week ‘ he has n’t done anything wrong from our perspective			1
we just have to support him and , of course , we feel sorry for him because that is a hard thing to go through			2
’ @entity0 has taken a hard - line approach to the fitness and diet of his players since being unveiled as @entity1 manager			1
but he was adamant yesterday that he has no issue whatsoever with any of his players socialising when their training schedule permits			2
‘ it is not a problem if they want to go out for dinner and do something social , ’ he added			0
‘ of course that is okay			0
he has n’t done anything wrong			0
he was out for dinner and that is perfectly right			0
that ’s why you get frightened about this , it ’s not fun to experience things like that and we have to take care of him			0
‘ if this was happening a lot of times , i would have to do something but i think this is a one - time situation , hopefully			0
@entity102 , who missed the league win over @entity104 , remains doubtful through injury ‘ you have to understand the life that you have in that city			0
they ( the players ) are role models and that is important to think about - but it is a police case and we will see what happens			0
’ @entity66 is likely to retain his place in goal , with full - back @entity116 also in contention despite being stretchered off in the 5 - 0 victory against @entity104 last saturday following a challenge by @entity121			1
but @entity102 , who missed the league victory in the @entity123 , is still doubtful through injury			0
@entity39 have failed to take a point from their opening games with @entity127 and @entity128 and there is a growing expectation that @entity1 could go on to top their group if they secure two wins from the double header to hit the 10 - point mark			1
however , boss @entity0 insisted that the side who finished second in their domestic league last season , and knocked @entity140 out of the @entity41 on their way to a place in @entity143 , should not be taken lightly			1
‘ they would be in the top three teams in @entity146 , ’ he stressed			0
‘ they are not a bad team			0
‘ the richest man in @entity40 has them and i played against them in january ( when he was boss of @entity152 in the @entity154 tournament ) and they have some quality players there			0
‘ but if you look at the group , you see that they do n’t have any points yet and that is a sign they may be a little bit weaker than @entity128 and @entity165 but those two teams are very good			0
