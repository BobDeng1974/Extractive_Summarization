in all the 30 years i have been working in asian elephant conservation , i thought i had seen it all – blatant corruption , the rape and total disregard of our beautiful planet and sickening wildlife atrocities , to name but a few			2
all due to the most dangerous animal of all : homo sapiens			2
not much shocks me any more , but something happened in recent weeks that shook me to the core when the charity @entity16 and the @entity17 set out to document the environmental genocide that is out of control on the island of @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity23 is special to me because i spent a lot of time there on expeditions when i was younger			2
it was a paradise – vast pristine forests , intact coral reefs and abundant wildlife			0
in a single generation , the population has been cut in half , with countless other animals disappearing at breakneck speed			0
during the filming , a helpless , emaciated baby male elephant called @entity34 , who was barely a year old , was found in a village , shackled with heavy chains to a tree			1
he had been taken hostage by the villagers , who were demanding compensation from the @entity57 government for the damage his family had done to their crops			1
can you believe that we are now living in a world where people are actually holding baby elephants to ransom ? it is almost unthinkable			1
but just look at the photographs – look at @entity34 , as he strains against his chains , waving his little trunk for food and reassurance			1
he is bellowing in desperation for his mother			0

he is bellowing in desperation for his mother			0
i have heard that sound of distressed calves many times in my life			0
it never fails to haunt me			0
but it is his eyes that haunt me more than anything – pleading for help – innocent , desperate and helpless			0
a war is being waged across @entity96			0
in the face of relentless deforestation , elephants are being forced out of their natural habitats and they have no choice but to share their living space with humans			1
as the elephants ’ forest home is destroyed , stressed and starving herds flee from the chainsaws straight into villages			2
they demolish everything in sight , trampling crops , flattening houses and often killing people			1
frankly , you really can not blame the villagers for taking such drastic steps in the sheer desperation to survive and feed their own families			2
capturing a baby elephant and holding it to ransom is grisly and depressing , but it is reality as humans and elephants fight for space			1
people need to know why this is happening			2
they need to understand what is driving this madness			0
@entity131 was shocked when he heard of the destruction of @entity21 's elephant population the cause is an innocently named product called palm oil			1
it ’s a constituent part of almost everything that we use and consume – biscuits , margarine , ice cream , soap , shampoo			0
and the blame lies firmly with the greed of the large corporations in the @entity149 that produce it as a cash crop to fuel the insatiable consumerism of the western world			2
the thirst for palm oil is apparently unquenchable and its cultivation is ripping out the last great rainforests			1
although forest destruction and its lethal impact on endangered species are plain to see , palm oil is practically an invisible ingredient , listed under the generic term ‘ vegetable oil ’			1
april , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 may not be household names , but these are just some of the companies producing palm oil in @entity22 and selling it on to the market for about £ 500 per ton			1
@entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity177 ’s pasties , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 ’s , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 are just a few of the more familiar names of those that use palm oil			1

some are better than others in getting palm oil from responsible sources , but the point is that it is everywhere and in everything			1
it is a silent assassin			0
not until 2014 will there be a legal requirement for manufacturers to label palm oil on their products			1
and , to make matters worse , the only certification body to monitor the production of so - called ‘ sustainable ’ palm oil is immensely flawed			1
consumer industries are hiding behind a fallacy			0
the verdant rainforest of @entity35 in @entity21 is one of the largest left in @entity96			1
it is the only place in the world where elephants , tigers , orang - utans and rhinos all still live together – a real life @entity234			1
but , right now , the @entity35 government is close to adopting a plan that would see hundreds of thousands of hectares of this forest opened up for the cultivation of palm oil			1
this ironically titled ‘ @entity245 ’ is nothing more than a deforestation plan – an extinction plan , seeking to legitimise the illegal felling that is already happening			2
environmentalists agree that we need to protect about 65 per cent of @entity35 ’s forest if we are to save its biodiversity			0
the government plan would allow for only 45 per cent to be protected – that ’s a difference of way over a million hectares , or more than a million football pitches			0
the result would be a death blow for wildlife			0
ecosystems are cleared for oil palm plantations in @entity259			1
this area is where the habitat was for @entity57 elephants , tigers and orangutans			1
not only will these iconic species be pushed to extinction , the local communities that rely on this forest will be even more exposed to natural disasters			0
devastating landslides have already washed away buildings , including entire schools			0
they will become unrelenting and vast areas of land will flood			2
wildlife will be forced into ever greater conflict with people , and elephants like @entity34 wo n’t stand a chance			1
sadly for him , it is too late			0
he died alone , still chained to that tree , though @entity16 worked tirelessly for a week to negotiate his release			0
already we ’ve discovered that another calf , this one just a month old , has been captured and held to ransom by local farmers			0
everyone is working around the clock to make sure that this little calf survives			0
but in the grander scheme of things there is hope			0
if there was n’t hope , i would have packed up my bags a long time ago			0
if we can protect these forests and stop the new plan in @entity35 from going ahead , then we ’re taking a giant step in the right direction			0
hundreds of supporters have already written to the @entity35 government urging them to stop destroying their forests			2
we need everyone to write			0
increased knowledge of palm oil and compulsory labelling will finally allow shoppers to make informed choices about what they buy			1
we need to push food manufacturers and retailers to support a transformation of the industry towards genuine sustainable palm oil , and we need to do it quickly			1
@entity131 and his sister , @entity321			0
he warns that we are close to losing the amazing @entity323 elephant i know for a fact that there is a truly powerful will to save these forests and these animals			2
on july 9 in @entity330 , @entity16 are holding a magnificent masked @entity331 to raise urgently needed funds that will help us continue our work in @entity21 and across @entity96			2
more than 600 guests are attending in support			0
i know i should be excited about the ball			0
in many ways i am , because of the great opportunity it presents for conservation , but on the night i know that i will not be able to get @entity34 and others like him out of my mind			2
the @entity323 elephant barely ever makes the headlines but this is one of the greatest wildlife stories of our time			2
we are close to losing one of the most enigmatic , iconic and ecologically vital species on the planet			0
please help us save @entity21 ’s elephants by contributing to the @entity353 at @entity354 .			1

in this shocking expose the @entity357 's brother reveals how baby elephant @entity34 was shockingly mistreated as he was kept captive in @entity21 . following the deforestation of the land to produce palm oil , elephants have been forced to live with humans , destroying farms , flattening houses and sometimes killing people . villagers took @entity34 , and demanded compensation after his family ruined crops in the area .
