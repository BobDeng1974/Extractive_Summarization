the owner of the upscale @entity2 boutique where @entity3 claimed she was barred from buying a $ 38,000 by a ‘ racist ’ sales assistant today demanded to speak to the star she branded ' over-sensitive ' and insisted her employee did ‘ everything right ’			1
the rather fearsome - looking @entity8 said she wanted to speak with the talk show billionairess ‘ as soon as possible ’ and also revealed her petrified member of staff will not be sacked or punished			1
she said : ‘ i do n't know why she talked of racism			1
i am sorry , but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here			0
maybe she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in the store			2
' it came as @entity3 said she was ' sorry ' a media frenzy emerged after saying she experienced racism during a trip to @entity2			1
i 'm really sorry that it got blown up			0
' i purposefully did not mention the name of the store , ' @entity3 said			1
' i was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people do n't expect that you would be able to be there			2
’ the firestorm blew up after @entity3 - who is promoting a film - gave an interview with @entity43 , in which she recalled a clerk at an upscale @entity46 boutique refusing to show her a handbag			1
@entity3 said she was told she could not afford the $ 38,000 tom ford @entity49 tote and said it proved that ‘ racism is still an issue ’			1
meanwhile , @entity53 said today : ‘ for @entity55 's sake , no ! i do not judge people according to their skin color , nor according to their income			2
and i also expect my employees to do the same			0
’ @entity61 has learned that the saleslady in question is @entity64 , aged 37 , and was not a full - time employee of the ritzy @entity67 shop in @entity46 where the incident took place - but she was sent there from the sister - store in upscale @entity71 to help out			1
now it is unclear where she is as she lies low in fear of ‘ public hatred ’			0
cutting : @entity22 suggested that - unlike @entity3 - in @entity78 famous people liked to be treated like ordinary citizens @entity80 , sorry : @entity3 said lat night at the premiere of her new film @entity82 , that she was ' sorry ' she had ever brought up the bag incident @entity8 , who was ironically also a guest at the wedding of @entity85 – the reason why @entity3 was in the country , has been left to speak for her			1
‘ it 's absurd , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity3 came into the business , wanted to see the crocodile bag			1
she inquired about the price			0
when my saleswoman told her that it cost 35,000 francs and then offered to show her cheaper ones , she walked away			2
and in a possible slap to @entity3 's diva tendencies , she added : ‘ that is something that international stars appreciate in our country - that you leave them in peace			1
’ ms. @entity8 , who regularly features in the society pages of @entity2 newspapers and magazines , said that there will be ‘ no repercussions ’ for her employee - an @entity64 woman who worked for five years in a boutique in @entity112 before joining her			1
she went on : ‘ she did everything right			0
i ca n't blame her			2
she has been working for five years with me and is an excellent seller			0
she usually works in @entity71 where there is a most demanding clientele			0
scene of the crime : the upmarket @entity120 in @entity46 where the incident took place ' she is so very sensitive			1
i repeat once again ; my saleslady only meant well because she wanted to show other bags to @entity3			1
to demonstrate the whole range is , for me , a perfect service			0
i find it regrettable that @entity3 has come to this service from exactly the wrong way			1
‘ i saw @entity3 at @entity85 's wedding but i only knew her from tv			1
we didn`t speak , and now unfortunately since then , this is played out before the entire world			0
‘ i hope the business will not suffer as a result of this			0
i hope i can speak with @entity3 to resolve the situation personally , as quickly as possible			2
’ today , it seemed that @entity3 – who earned $ 77m last year , according to @entity142 , was desperately trying to take her foot out of the mess she ’d put it in			1
last night , the star gave an interview on the red carpet of @entity82 , in which she has a role			2
she said : ' i 'm in a store and the person does n't obviously know that i carry the black card and so they make an assessment based upon the way i look and who i am , ' said @entity3 , who earned $ 77 million in the year ending in june , according to @entity142			1
wedding guests : ironically , @entity53 and wonfrey were both at the @entity2 wedding of @entity85 to @entity160 ( pictured ) ' i did n't have anything that said " i have money " : i was n't wearing a diamond stud			0
i did n't have a pocketbook			0
i did n't wear @entity166 shoes			0
i did n't have anything , ' she said			0
' you should be able to go in a store looking like whatever you look like and say " i 'd like to see this "			0
' @entity2 tourism officials and the boutique owner apologized for the incident last week , but @entity3 insists there 's no need			1
' it 's not an indictment against the country or even that store , ' she continued			1
' it was just one person who did n't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag			0
' so no apologies necessary from the country of @entity2			0
if somebody makes a mistake in the @entity193 do we apologize in front of the whole country ? no ! ' ironically , @entity3 also came under fire today from the @entity2 animal rights group @entity197 ( @entity198 ) which slammed her for wanting to buy a crocodile skin bag and called on @entity200 to withdraw the item from sale			1
‘ we do not know if ms. @entity3 actually wanted to buy the bag , ’ said @entity203 , spokeswoman for the group			2
‘ but she should know crocodiles suffer for the production of such items			0
‘ the animals are kept in extremely small enclosures , ' she said			0
' to kill them the animals are beaten with a hammer on the head , and in some farms and it sometimes takes two hours before they are dead			0
’ @entity3 is an avowed animal rights spokeswoman			2
@entity217 , the world ’s largest animal rights group , named her “ person of the year ” in 2008 after she spoke out against the wearing of fur .			0

@entity22 took a swipe at @entity3 's diva tendencies , saying that international stars like to be ' left in peace ' in her country
@entity3 had *accused* one of her staff of ' racism ' for refusing to show her a $ 38,000 handbag at the @entity46 store
@entity64 sales assistant , 37 , wo n't be fired or punished and ' did everything right ' in the eyes of her boss
meanwhile , says she is ' sorry ' that she ever brought up the incident during interview to promote her new film
