by @entity0 leading doctors have accused the government of betraying @entity4 whistleblowers despite promising they will be protected			1
they say nothing has changed over the last year even though ministers have pledged to change the culture of the @entity8 to make it easier for staff to raise concerns			1
only last week it emerged that an @entity4 trust had spent £ 10million trying to silence cardiologist dr @entity14 who warned of patients dying on overcrowded wards			1
unfairly dismissed : dr @entity14 with his wife @entity17 he was suspended from @entity19 's @entity18 in 2000 and later sacked but last thursday he was vindicated when a high court judge ruled he had been unfairly dismissed			1
since then , a further two cases have come to light involving senior doctors who have effectively been barred from the @entity4 after raising concerns			1
@entity25 , a surgeon at the @entity26 in @entity27 , has been suspended on full pay since 2012 after warning a patient had become brain damaged due to poor care			0
and paediatric surgeon @entity32 has been suspended by @entity33 in @entity34 since 2009 and wrongly accused of being ' suicidal ' after warning that five patients had died needlessly			2
dr @entity36 , of the @entity37 , said : ' we have constantly been promised better protection for whistleblowers and an end to long - term suspensions			1
' last march , health secretary @entity44 promised to end ' the era of gagging @entity4 staff '			1
it followed a damning inquiry into the @entity50 hospital scandal , in which doctors and nurses were bullied for raising concerns			0
it later emerged staff were being made to sign gagging orders after being sacked , meaning they lose any pay - off if they speak about poor care			2
mr @entity44 set up a whistleblowing helpline for staff and promised they would be supported			0
but there is growing consensus that the culture remains the same			2
last month dr @entity65 , a paediatrician who raised the alarm at the clinic which failed to spot abuse in the high - profile @entity70 case , told mps there had not been any significant change			1
she said : ' i do n't think things have moved on in any significant way at all			0
' and @entity78 , who is helping the @entity79 draw up whistleblowing training for @entity4 staff , said : ' i think there 's a shift beginning			1
' but when it filters down to the frontline staff , i think there 's been very little change			2
' in a victory for whistleblowers , dr @entity14 was cleared last thursday of any wrongdoing			1
@entity19 and @entity4 trust – which runs @entity18 – had pursued him through employment tribunals , running up a bill of £ 10million			1
but there are fears that there are many other cases of whistleblowers being suspended			2
dr @entity25 raised concerns about a patient who suffered a brain injury after becoming disconnected from a ventilator for more than ten minutes			2
he was suspended after being accused of bullying colleagues			0
dr @entity32 spoke out about the quality of surgery at @entity33 in 2009			2
he was suspended when the hospital ruled him to be ' suicidal '			0
the @entity106 rejects that assessment			0
a @entity79 spokesman said : ' @entity4 staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out in the interests of patient safety must be protected and listened to			1
the secretary of state has written to all trusts to remind them of their responsibilities in this important area			0
' @entity119 the former chief executive of @entity121 was sacked in 2010 after raising concerns about care and made to sign a gagging @entity124 says he was offered a £ 500,000 severance deal to keep quiet			0
the trust was later placed under investigation by health chiefs over its high mortality rates			0
but mr @entity119 says he will never again be able to work in the @entity4 as managers do n't trust him not to speak out			1
@entity131 a leading paediatric surgeon , dr @entity131 was forced out in 2010 after warning that babies were dying needlessly at @entity33			1
his concerns were vindicated in a damning review of the hospital earlier this year which warned of safety problems due to inexperienced @entity140 - @entity139 @entity142 - @entity141 was an employee helping to compile hospital death rates when she claimed bosses at @entity145 were fiddling figures			1
she was suspended and received a letter saying she could be sacked			0
after the @entity148 drew attention to her case , health secretary @entity44 said he would ensure all action against her was frozen			0
but she says she is still under investigation			0
@entity154 the @entity4 manager was sacked from @entity157 hospitals after telling bosses that children and vulnerable adults were being abused			2
he said they were routinely restrained and shut away in cubicles for up to 12 hours with no food or drink			0
mr @entity154 was suspended then formally dismissed last year			0
he said he had been treated worse than a ' common criminal ' .			0
