by @entity0 scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions			1
melting snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely worn by a fashion - conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago			1
the find , which sheds more light on the life of people living in the @entity13 , was found two years ago in @entity14 , but has recently been examined by scientists			1
scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic ( pictured ) was made between 230 and 390 ad			2
scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in icy regions and this tunic , worn by a reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago , was found in melting snow @entity28 , from the @entity29 and @entity30 , from the @entity26 in @entity27 , told @entity31 : ' due to global warming , rapid melting of snow patches and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of @entity14 as in other parts of the world , and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge from the ice each year			1
' other scientists have also said more hidden artefacts are being exposed in cold regions as temperatures rise , and while this is proving exciting , there is a risk that rare items could rot or disintegrate when exposed to air if they are not discovered very quickly			2
the tunic , which was found in melting snow , has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool woven in diamond twill , which was apparently fashionable at the time			1
scientists using radiocarbon dating believe the woolly tunic was made between 230 and 390 ad and was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the @entity63 glacier , at around 6,560 feet above sea level , where it was found			1
professor @entity30 described the find as very rare and added that the number of fashion items discovered from the early first millennium ad in @entity70 can be counted on one hand			2
scientists believe the tunic was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the @entity14 @entity62 ( pictured ) , at around 6,560 feet above sea level , where it was found			1
they said global warming and melting ice is taking place in the mountains and hundreds of archaeological artefacts are being discovered researchers ' examinations of the tunic using a scanning electron microscope revealed that two different types of wool were used to make the garment - wool from an adult sheep and softer lamb 's wool			1
the scientists said : ' there is no doubt that the wool was carefully chosen for both fabrics , and that both quality and natural pigmentation were taken into consideration			2
' it appears that the tunic was pretty stylish in its day as the fabric was carefully mottled using the light and darker threads to deliberate effect			0
it would have fitted a slender man measuring about 5 feet 9 inches tall and the tunic would have been quite short and pulled over the head like a regular jumper , as it has no buttons			0
the find is relatively similar to another tunic found more than 150 years ago in a bog at @entity116 , @entity117 in northern @entity118 , which is presumed to have belonged to an officer as it was found with early weaponry			1
professor @entity30 said : ' the similarity between the two tunics is very interesting as it suggests that a specific style was intended , and that this " fashion " was known over a wide area			0
' the archaeologists have found approximately 50 fragments of items in the same area as the tunic ( pictured ) that they will date and analyse and predict they will find many more if the global temperatures rise as predicted			1
it is hoped the finds will give historians a better grasp on fashion and textiles of the first millennium ad			2
both the tunics were woven in a diamond twill pattern and had been mended in areas , suggesting they were relatively hard - wearing as well as precious			0
professor @entity30 is unsure if the @entity14 garment was passed down or shared between people , but said the hunter probably looked after the tunic			1
she believes it could have started out as a sleeveless design that was later adapted , as the first repair used a patch from the body section , while a second patch came from a different fabric used to make the sleeves			0
despite the apparent care of the owner , the archaeologists do not know how the jumper was lost on the mountains but speculate the hunter might have been caught in a snow flurry or particularly dense fog and was unable to find his garment			1

a number of scientists have admitted that a surprising benefit of global warming is the rapid discovery of hidden artefacts in cold regions			0
the tunic , which was found in melting snow , has a trendy boat neck and is crafted from wool , woven in diamond twill ( pictured ) , which was apparently popular at the time			1
however , the world 's glaciers are disintegrating and ice melting so quickly that archaeologists could lose relics exposed to the air if they are nor discovered incredibly quickly			1
human remains and natural materials are most at risk			0
wool , features are leather can disintegrate in mere days when freed from the ice , while wood can take a few years to rot , @entity197 reported			2
@entity204 of @entity205 , @entity203 noted a frighteningly fast rate of thaw in the @entity208 , where he is looking for artefacts associated with @entity211 's invasion of modern @entity212 with elephants in 218 bc. he said : ' this is the first summer since 1994 when we began our field excavations above 8,000ft that we have not been inundated by even one day of rain , sleet and snow flurries			0
i expect we will see more ice patch archaeology discoveries			0
' @entity223 scientists have previously claimed that climate change is damaging archaeological treasures that have been preserved for thousands of years			2
experts at the @entity228 's @entity227 said remains in some of the coldest places on earth are becoming exposed as warmer temperatures cause ice and hardened ground to thaw			0
dr @entity235 , of the university , said : ' warming climates are expected to lead to more melting ice , and we need to take action to safeguard ancient treasures			0
' long - term efforts are needed to locate archaeological remains that are at risk , and research how best to care for them			0

scientists said ' hundreds of archaeological finds ' are discovered under ice each year and predict more will be found as the @entity250 gets warmer
