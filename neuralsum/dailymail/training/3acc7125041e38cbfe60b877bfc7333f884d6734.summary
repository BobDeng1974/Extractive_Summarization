by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 lost amid @entity4 ’s struggle to define his role in @entity7 ’s team is the fact that many young @entity10 starlets have the chance to prove the manager can count on them in @entity13			1
@entity14 is expected to start his first full international at left - back against @entity17 in @entity19 ’s @entity18 , with @entity20 also in contention to start his first @entity10 game in midfield			1
as @entity7 prepares to experiment and try a few different options it could be one of the least experienced @entity10 team for many years , offset of course by @entity28 and @entity4 , who have close to 200 caps between them			1
after watching something like his first - choice team win 3 - 0 at home to @entity45 , this is the first big test for @entity7 ’s admirable policy to take his young lions to @entity13			2
scratch the surface of the first team and suddenly @entity10 have a different profile , with central defenders @entity52 and @entity53 , who do not always play at @entity54 , let alone in tandem in central defence			2
up front , @entity58 , 32 years old and quite possibly still high after completing a transfer to his beloved @entity60 and yet still a @entity63 rookie with only 110 minutes of competitive international football under his belt			0
in midfield @entity66 is expected to start as he continues his bid to prove his fitness over 90 minutes and challenge @entity70 for a place alongside @entity72			0
breather : @entity66 and @entity74 will also start in @entity10 's midfield chance : @entity38 will start between the posts for @entity10 while @entity35 will play at right back can @entity66 stay fit ? is @entity74 , out for six weeks with a groin problem , ready for the rigours of a @entity63 ? @entity7 will probably learn far more from this experimental line - up in @entity81 than he did at @entity82 against the @entity45			1
the @entity10 boss has tinkered , trying different personnel in different formations in tactical training sessions since the squad came together , including at times a diamond midfield and two up front , similar to the way @entity60 play , but on tuesday in training at the @entity18 he used the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 shape he has come to trust in the recent games			1
the side he lined up - @entity38 ; @entity35 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity14 ; @entity28 , @entity66 ; @entity74 , @entity20 , @entity4 ; @entity58 - has a total of just 303 caps , at an average of 27.5 each			1
take @entity28 and @entity4 out of the equation and the rest of the team has an average of 12.2 caps , the bulk of which will have been earned in non-competitive fixtures			0
this fresh and youthful feel has so far been a boost for @entity10 , helping to banish the lingering bitterness of past failures and generate the positive energy which has been a feature of the camp during their first two and a half weeks together			0
out to impress : @entity31 will hope to come off the bench and look good in front of @entity7 this game against @entity17 , however , is a genuine challenge			1
do they have the talent and mental strength to get through in unfamiliar surroundings and in heat and humidity against opponents who are expected to be much stronger and more purposeful than @entity45 ? @entity17 finished above @entity125 in the @entity127 qualifying group and 18 - year - old @entity14 will be up against their captain @entity128 , of @entity54			2
@entity130 did not look like the 70 - cap star - man when he arrived at the @entity18 for training last night , helping the coaches to carry boxes of food into the dressing room			0
@entity14 , who made his @entity10 debut as a half - time substitute against @entity139 in march , has played against many wingers of comparable quality in the @entity142 this season but he can not boast the experience of football in this climate , against a team used to playing in the heat			1
so far , without fuss , he has passed every test thrown his way in a breakthrough season			0
@entity7 will hope to see his steady progress continue			2
just as he will hope others prove his bold selection policy right in the @entity19 heat			0
main man : @entity128 ( centre ) will be @entity17 's main threat against @entity10 in @entity19			0

@entity7 will play a much - changed side in @entity10 's second *friendly*
@entity14 , @entity20 and @entity74 will all start
@entity31 will hope to impress from the bench
@entity4 will start on the left
