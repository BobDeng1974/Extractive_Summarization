by @entity0 @entity1 , 21 , who was once one of the rising stars of @entity3 , has quit today calling the party 's latest advertising campaign ' racist ' a @entity3 poster girl described by @entity7 as a ‘ rising star ’ has quit after describing it as a ‘ racist ’ and ‘ terrifying ’ party that she can not vote for			1
@entity1 , 21 , a @entity12 - born @entity11 who had starred in a party election broadcast and spoken at its annual conference , accused @entity3 of deliberately attracting racist voters			1
the university student said the party had abandoned its core supporters and called on others to end their memberships and boycott the upcoming @entity23 elections			1
just days after she appeared on @entity24 to defend the party , miss @entity1 said she had quit as it has ‘ descended into a form of racist populism ’			1
she said : ‘ the direction in which the party is going is terrifying			2
this week i decided to leave the party and i will abstain from voting in the upcoming @entity23 elections			2
i urge other @entity3 supporters to do the same			0
‘ @entity3 is exploiting the stupidity of ignorant anti-immigrant voters for electoral gain			0
while the party deliberately attracts the racist vote , i refuse to be associated with them			1
’ privately - educated miss @entity1 , who was previously chairman of its youth wing in @entity41 , specifically attacked one of its campaign posters for next week ’s elections , which reads : ‘ 26 million people in @entity23 are looking for work			1
and whose jobs are they after ? ’ ‘ the poster epitomises where the party is going wrong , ’ she wrote in the blog post for the @entity51 website			2
they are turning the election into a game of " us " and " them "			0
well , i am with " them "			0
‘ having worked so hard to help @entity3 rid themselves of their " racist " label and denying comparisons to the @entity74 , this direction of campaigning really is n't doing my former colleagues any favours			0
’ miss @entity1 's accusations come less than a week after mr @entity7 appeared alongside of black and ethnic minority candidates at a rally in @entity41 , in an attempt to shake off claims @entity3 is racist			1
the @entity84 anthropology student said that when she joined the party aged 17 , ‘ there was none of this " they took our jobs " business ’			2
she added : ‘ @entity3 is straying further and further from the policies that attracted so many of its original supporters , instead cynically pursuing ever more aggressive anti-immigrant rhetoric			0
‘ @entity3 's immigration policy , to me , was all about equality for every nationality ; it was about treating @entity23 and people outside the @entity100 equally			0
@entity3 's rising star @entity1 was angry with the party 's poster campaign ( pictured ) which claimed 26 million @entity23 wanted @entity12 jobs ‘ but the recent racism scandals suggest , it seems , that most other @entity3 voters and members support the policy – and the party – for a very different reason			1
’ ‘ previously fundamental policies like taxation and promoting a small state are being ignored in favour of going after the votes of those who think @entity119 " should emigrate to a black country "			0
’ @entity7 hailed @entity120 as @entity3 's rising star - but she quit today after despairing over the party 's bid to win ' racist ' voters miss @entity1 , who grew up in @entity125 and was born to @entity127 parents , has been a prominent member of @entity3 appearing in a party election broadcast last year and speaking twice at its annual conference			1
appearing in a @entity131 video with miss @entity1 , mr @entity7 said : ‘ @entity1 , you ’re 18 - years - old and you ’re a rising star in the party			1
at the conference you were the most popular speaker so i ’m going to have to watch my step , are n’t i , as time goes on			0
’ in a newspaper interview , miss @entity1 described mr @entity7 a ' a babe ' and said @entity140 was ‘ cute and so kind and hilarious , he just says things for the reaction			1
lovely guy but a bit misunderstood			0
’ @entity3 has been hit by a string of embarrassing comments from candidates in the last few weeks			0
one member who featured in the party ’s election broadcast was suspended after saying @entity151 was ‘ not a real @entity152 ’ and describing @entity153 as an ‘ evil organisation ’			0
another supporter said @entity119 , the comedian , should emigrate to a “ black country ”			0
appearing at a rally last week mr @entity7 said that ‘ there will always be a few people who creep over the line and cause us embarrassment ’ , but that the party did not welcome those with extremist or offensive views			1
standing on stage flanked by black and ethnic minority councillors and candidates , he said : ‘ from this moment on please do not ever call us a racist party			2
we are not a racist party			2

@entity1 urges supporters not to vote for party *anymore*
hit out at ad campaign which claimed 26 million migrants after @entity12 jobs
