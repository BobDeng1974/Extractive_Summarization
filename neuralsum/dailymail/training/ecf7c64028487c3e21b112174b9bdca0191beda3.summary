by @entity0 @entity1 attempted to put a funny spin on @entity4 's struggles in the transfer market in order to quell fan discontent			1
the former @entity9 manager has been linked with moves for @entity11 and @entity12 , players he managed at @entity14 , but has not yet been able to land his targets			1
