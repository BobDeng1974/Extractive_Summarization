by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the average age of new mothers has hit 30 for the first time			1
women choosing to delay starting their families until later in life mean the average age when giving birth has risen by four years since the 1970s			1
experts said it was a sign of women opting to concentrate on their careers before settling down , while also a sign of ‘ how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century ’			0
last year there were 698,512 births in @entity19 and @entity20 , down by 4.3 per cent since 2012			1
however , the average age of mothers rose to 30years , compared with 29.8 years in 2012			1
it is the first time the average age has surpassed the three - decade mark since records began in 1938			2
the @entity25 said : ' the average age of mothers has been increasing since 1975 , with increasing numbers of women delaying childbearing to later ages			1
' this may be due to a number of factors such as increased participation in higher education , increased female participation in the labour force , the increasing importance of a career , the rising opportunity costs of childbearing , labour market uncertainty , housing factors and instability of partnerships			0
' @entity45 decreased among all age groups last year , but the biggest fall was among women aged under 20 and 20 - 24 , down by 13 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively			2
the @entity25 added : ‘ in most developed countries women have been increasingly delaying childbearing to later in life , which has resulted in increases in the mean age at first birth and rising fertility rates among older women			2
‘ although fertility rates for women aged 40 and over have been rising fast , fertility among women in their forties is still considerably lower than for women in their thirties			0
women aged 30 - 34 currently have the highest fertility of any age group			0
’ @entity68 , chief executive of the @entity69 , said : ' the average age of mothers in this country has hit 30 for the first time as many women are deciding to start their families later in life			1
@entity77 mothers are now on average older than women elsewhere in the world when they have their first baby			2
' there may be many reasons for this , including the time it takes to achieve educational and professional development , as well as financial security - and it may also be a reflection of how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century			0
' we need to support women 's choices to have children at the age that is right for them			0
we certainly need policies in place that enable women to better combine family and working life , and in particular ensure that younger mothers do n't suffer setbacks			0
' while pregnancy and birth in older women may present slightly different challenges for healthcare professionals , the answer is not to cajole women into having babies before they are ready but to ensure our family planning and maternity services are set up to cater for the changing needs and choices of women today			0
' almost half of all babies ( 47 per cent ) were born outside marriage , up from 41 per cent a decade ago			1
in 1938 , when records began , just 4.2 per cent of babies had parents who had not tied the knot			0
the percentage of babies born in @entity19 and @entity20 to mothers from outside the @entity77 also reached a record high , hitting 26.5 per cent compared with 25.9 per cent in 2012 and 11.7 per cent when these records were first collected in 1969 .			1
