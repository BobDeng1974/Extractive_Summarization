in a significant blow for @entity4 ahead of the new year , female support for an @entity2 prime minister has now dropped to its lowest level in almost two decades			1
despite his lack of popularity with women , foreign minister @entity6 believes mr @entity4 should remain the minister for women			1
' i believe that we have had to take some very tough decisions since the election and we have and they are not always popular , ' she told @entity18 host @entity17			0
' we are seeking to do the best for @entity2 , we 're acting in @entity2 's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings , ' the deputy liberal leader said on monday @entity4 's lack of popularity now mirrors the fall in support for newly elected pm @entity42 some 18 years back			1
despite dwindling polls for the @entity1 and the @entity28 and the recent @entity31 reshuffle , ms @entity6 is seeking to remain positive			0
' we are seeking to do the best for @entity2 , we 're acting in @entity2 's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings , ' the deputy liberal leader said			0
however , she did concede that ' it 's been a difficult time for us '			0
and that is reflected in the dwindling support level for mr @entity4 from men too , which according to the latest @entity53 , which is published in the @entity2 newspaper , has crashed 10 points since the federal election			2
it is now at its lowest level since mr @entity4 toppled communications minister @entity25 for the leadership in 2009			1
she also leapt to the defence of her embattled leader , who was criticised over his claim that his greatest achievement as minister for women was abolishing the carbon tax			0
' i think the prime minister mentioned a number of things , not only the carbon tax , ' she added			2
' i think one of the most important things we can do is repair the budget and put @entity2 on a strong economic footing so that @entity2 women can realise their potential , can have the opportunity to have a job if they wish			0
' ' the @entity1 has chosen to take that portfolio and i think it 's important to have it in the office of the @entity1 , it reflects the significance we attach to women 's issues , ' @entity6 said in response to questions as to whether mr @entity4 should relinquish the minister for women role the @entity1 - who was the target of @entity97 's famous misogyny speech - recently drew more fire for suggesting that sexism was behind criticism of his powerful chief of staff			1
mr @entity4 slapped down members of his own party following reports of growing tension between @entity106 , his top adviser , and coalition ministers , particularly @entity6			1
' do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was @entity115 - @entity114 as opposed to p - @entity116 ? ' mr @entity4 stated			2
' i think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms			0
' recent polls have underscored @entity6 's increasing popularity , with her own approval rating as preferred @entity123 leader more than doubling in the past six months , second only to @entity25			2
@entity6 leapt to the defence of her embattled leader , who was criticised over his claim that his greatest achievement as minister for women was abolishing the carbon tax			0
' i think the prime minister mentioned a number of things , not only the carbon tax , ' she added in an interview on monday there was also the widely - reported argument between ms @entity6 and the @entity1 , after she read media reports that a male colleague , @entity139 , would ' chaperone ' her to the @entity141 climate change conference in @entity142 , @entity143			1
but the foreign minister kept to message on monday , stating that jobs and opportunity remain the government 's focus , as the @entity28 's support among female voters came in at 36 per cent for the past three months , down eight points since the federal poll			1
she was adamant that there was no need for mr @entity4 to relinquish the role of minister for women			2
' the @entity1 has chosen to take that portfolio and i think it 's important to have it in the office of the pm , it reflects the significance we attach to women 's issues , ' she said			0
' the fact that it 's held in the highest office in the land i think is a positive			0
' @entity53 also revealed that , over the final quarter of 2014 , @entity170 continues to hold a strong lead over @entity4 as preferred prime minister			1
@entity174 also enjoys stronger female support as the year comes to a close @entity53 also revealed that , over the final quarter of 2014 , @entity170 continues to hold a strong lead over @entity4 as preferred prime minister			1
he has 41 per cent backing over mr @entity4 's 37			1
the pm 's dissatisfaction rating is at 55 per cent , against the @entity180 's 43			0
@entity174 's female support is up slightly to 38 per cent , two points better than the @entity28 .			0

@entity4 's popularity with female voters lowest for a pm in 18 years
lack of support from women has *n't* been this bad since @entity42 's *earliest* days as prime minister
@entity6 *insists* the pm should retain minister for women portfolio
mr @entity4 is also losing touch with male voters , falling to 2009 levels
@entity170 remains preferred pm , with a four point lead over @entity4 *measured* across the final quarter of 2014
