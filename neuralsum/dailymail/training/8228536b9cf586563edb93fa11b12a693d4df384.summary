by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:53 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 03:06 est , 9 january 2013 after years of innuendo , speculation and accusations , @entity2 is to take the route of many a disgraced public figure and offer himself up for a no - holds - barred interview with @entity9			1
a special 90 - minute episode of ' @entity11 ' will air on january 17th on @entity9 's own network and it is widely expected @entity2 , 41 , will give an emotional account of the alleged doping scandal and use of performance enhancing drugs that has ruined his once glittering career			1
the timing of the interview at his home in @entity24 , @entity19 will raise eyebrows as it comes just days after reports suggested that the cyclist is considering admitting publicly that he consistently cheated throughout his decade at the top of his sport in which he became a hero to millions			1
@entity2 speaking with @entity9 in 2005 - the one time cycling legend is to give his first ever no - hold - barred interview with the chat - show queen on january 17th according to a release posted on @entity9 's website on tuesday , it 's the first interview with @entity2 since his athletic career crumbled under the weight of a massive report by @entity40 detailing allegations of drug use by the famous cyclist and teammates on his @entity46 teams			1
it 's unclear if the interview at @entity2 's home in @entity24 , @entity19 , has already been taped			1
@entity49 , a spokeswoman for @entity50 & @entity51 , declined comment			0
@entity2 has strongly denied the doping charges that led to him being stripped of his seven @entity55 titles , but the @entity56 reported friday he has told associates he is considering admitting the use of @entity59			1
the newspaper report cited anonymous sources , and @entity2 attorney @entity62 told @entity0 that night that he had no knowledge of @entity2 considering a confession			1
earlier tuesday , ' 60 minutes sports ' reported the head of the @entity40 told the show a representative for @entity2 offered the agency a ' donation ' in excess of $ 150,000 several years before an investigation by the organization led to the loss of @entity2 's @entity55 titles			2
in an interview for the premiere airing on @entity79 on wednesday night , @entity40 ceo @entity76 said he was ' stunned ' when he received the offer in 2004			2
@entity2 has agreed to a tell - all interview with @entity9 where he will address allegations that he used performance - enhancing drugs during his cycling career ' it was a clear conflict of interest for @entity40 , ' @entity76 said			1
' we had no hesitation in rejecting that offer			0
' @entity62 denied such an offer was made			2
' no truth to that story , ' @entity62 wrote tuesday in an email to the @entity0 ' @entity94 heard of it was today			0
he never made any such contribution or suggestion			0
' @entity76 was traveling and did not respond to requests from the @entity0 for comment			0
@entity40 spokeswoman @entity100 said @entity76 's comments from the interview were accurate			0
in it , he reiterates what he told the @entity0 last fall : that he was surprised when federal investigators abruptly shut down their two - year probe into @entity2 and his business dealings , then refused to share any of the evidence they had gathered			1
' you 'll have to ask the feds why they shut down , ' @entity76 told the @entity0 ' they enforce federal criminal laws			0
we enforce sports anti-doping violations			0
we 've done our job			0
' @entity2 is expected to deliver candid and clear comments on the allegations of performance enhancing drug use that have dogged his entire career and subsequent retirement this dramatic news comes just two days after it was reported that @entity2 may be considering a change in course , dropping his years of denials and admitting that he used performance - enhancing drugs - even though such a move might be unwise			1
the @entity56 , citing anonymous sources , reported late friday that @entity2 has told associates he is thinking about the move			2
however , @entity2 attorney @entity62 says that the cyclist has n't reached out to @entity40 chief executive @entity76 and @entity134 , director general of the @entity135			1
a @entity40 spokeswoman declined comment on saturday , while @entity134 was quoted by the @entity138 in @entity139 , where he is vacationing , saying @entity2 has not approached his group			2
@entity2 's attorney , @entity62 , denied such an offer was made , saying : ' no truth to that story			1
@entity94 heard of it was today			0
he never made any such contribution or suggestion ' @entity40 stripped @entity2 of his seven @entity55 titles last year and issued a report portraying the cyclist as the leader of a sophisticated doping operation on his winning teams			1
public confessions and apologies have been the route of redemption for several athletes who have gotten in trouble			2
for example , @entity160 said he was sorry for cheating on his wife in televised speech , and baseball slugger @entity164 eventually admitted to steroid use			0
yet @entity2 faces serious legal entanglements those megastars did n't , and a confession to doping could end up complicating matters for @entity2 - not making them easier			1
the @entity172 @entity171 is considering whether to join a federal whistle - blower lawsuit filed by former @entity2 teammate @entity174 alleging fraud against the @entity46 during the years the agency sponsored @entity2 's teams			1
a @entity179 - based promotions company has also said it wants to recover several million dollars paid to @entity2 in bonuses for winning the @entity55			1
and the @entity182 newspaper @entity181 is suing to recover about $ 500,000 paid to @entity2 to settle a libel lawsuit			2
despite damning evidence @entity2 has yet to admit any wrongdoing although that could be about to change @entity2 has testified under oath that he never used performance - enhancing drugs , which could theoretically lead to charges if he confessed			1
former @entity172 track star @entity190 spent several months in federal prison for lying to investigators about her drug use			0
and after so many years of vehement denials and sworn statements that he never doped , at this point , what would @entity2 gain from a confession ? there would be no guarantee that his personal sponsors would return or that the public would accept it			1
is the public even interested in an @entity206 confession ? @entity207 , executive vice president of @entity208 , a @entity210 - based crisis and issues management firm , said ' it may be too little , too late because he 's been denying it for so long			2
' a confession would only work to salvage @entity2 's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and blamed no one else , @entity207 said			2
and it would have to include some public act of atonement			0
' if he does all three , he has a shot , ' @entity207 said			0
' you have to show people you are willing to pay a price			0
' the @entity56 reported the 41 - year - old @entity2 may be considering a confession in an attempt to reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and @entity230 sport so he can return to competing in triathlons and elite running events			1
@entity2 lost most of his personal sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after @entity40 issued its report and he left the board of the @entity237 cancer - fighting charity he founded in 1997			1
he is still worth about a reported $ 100 million			0
@entity237 might be one reason to issue an apology			0
the charity supports cancer patients and still faces an image problem because of its association with its famous founder			0
and if @entity2 did confess , the corporate sponsors who abandoned him might support him again , @entity207 said			2
more allegations : the chief of the @entity40 said that a representative for @entity2 offered the agency in excess of $ 150,000 several years before the doping investigation @entity2 was accused last october of running ' the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen ' ' they 'll do what the public does , ' @entity207 said			1
@entity258 , the wife of former @entity2 teammate @entity259 , was one of the first to publicly accuse @entity2 of using performance - enhancing drugs			1
she dismissed a potential confession from @entity2 as self - serving and too late			1
' sorry , your chance is over			0
you 're banned for life			0
it 's not with an asterisk , that because you are @entity2 you get to come back , ' @entity259 said			2
' he does not belong in sport			0
' according to the code , an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped , who helped him dope and how he got away with doping			0
@entity2 has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation			1
in november he was spotted canoeing in the warm @entity279 waters just off @entity280			0
the holiday island has become a regular destination for @entity2 to seek refuge , as he throws himself into training for @entity286 events			2
an @entity286 consists of a 2.4 - mile swim , a 112 - mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2 - mile run , raced in that order and without a break			0
most @entity294 events have a strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race .			0
