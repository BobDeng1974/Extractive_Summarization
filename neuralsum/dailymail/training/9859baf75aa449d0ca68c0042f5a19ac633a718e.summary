by @entity0 in @entity1 at the age of 76 he became a household name and a magazine cover star			0
but pope @entity6 is apparently desperate to avoid becoming a celebrity – he has ordered the removal of a new life - size statue of him in @entity11 cathedral			1
since its installation two weeks ago believers visited the statue in the cathedral ’s garden to pay homage to the pontiff , while tourists posed for photos alongside it			0
the statue of @entity6 is made of fiberglass and is 5 ' 6 '' tall			1
it was installed at the @entity11 ' @entity26 at the end of june pope @entity6 has been accused of encouraging illegal immigration after expressing solidarity with asylum seekers and economic refugees during his visit to the island of @entity34			1
during his visit on monday , @entity6 said the tens of thousands of migrants from @entity37 and the @entity38 who arrive from @entity40 and @entity41 should be dealt with compassionately			1
he said the asylum seekers were ' brothers and sisters of ours trying to escape difficult situations to find some serenity and peace '			0
but @entity6 , formerly archbishop of the @entity48 capital , was reportedly horrified at the news			1
he got straight on the phone and had strong words with the priest responsible telling him : ‘ get that thing down , immediately ’ , the @entity48 newspaper @entity54 reported			1
church sources told the newspaper that @entity6 is determined to avoid creating ‘ a cult of personality ’ like that enjoyed by @entity57 since his election in march , @entity6 has gone to lengths to be seen as humble , showing little patience for the pomp and fuss that come with his position as head of the world ’s 1.2 billion @entity67			1
the statue was popular with tourists , who often posed alongside it for photographs wave goodbye : @entity6 , seen right during a visit to @entity34 , @entity74 , on monday , wants the statue gone he rarely wears the robes and trimmings traditionally allocated to the @entity6 , continuing instead to wear a simple white cassock and iron cross			2
he has refused to move into the luxurious @entity80 apartments , saying they are too grand , and prefers to live instead in a humble guesthouse for visiting clerics , with whom he eats meals and offers mass every morning			0
but his new celebrity is unavoidable - especially as the statue ’s removal coincides with the naming of @entity6 as @entity91 by @entity94 magazine ’s @entity74 edition			2
the magazine gushed : ‘ his first 100 days have already placed him in the category of world leaders who make history			0
but the revolution continues … ’ done without his blessing : the statue is set to be removed , despite its popularity the announcement was followed by a slew of celebrity endorsements			0
@entity106 commented : ' @entity6 is a miracle of humility in a an era of vanity			2
’ the statue , installed ten days ago , was the vision of sculptor @entity113 , who also created the statues for a @entity116 theme park called @entity117 in @entity48			0
he has previously produced statues of @entity57 and @entity119			2
it remains to be seen whether a @entity6 museum at the site , announced two weeks ago , will also be vetoed by the @entity6 .			0
