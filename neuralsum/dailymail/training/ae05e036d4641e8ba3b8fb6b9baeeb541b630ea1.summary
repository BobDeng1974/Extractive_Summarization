suffered a miscarriage in november 2010 that she believes was triggered by sitting beneath fluorescent lights at work hypersensitive : @entity5 , 34 , says she suffers adverse effects when she is exposed to electromagnetic waves she can not make a call on a mobile phone , have a coffee in an internet cafe or pick up an @entity12			1
so severe is @entity5 's sensitivity to electromagnetic waves that her husband has to run errands in town in case she is exposed			1
the pregnant mother - of - one suffers from electrosensitivity which gives her splitting headaches , stomach cramps , bloating and flu - like symptoms whenever she is exposed to electromagnetic waves			1
her sensitivity to modern technology is now so severe that she lives a rural life in the countryside with her partner @entity31 , 34 , where mobiles are banned , cordless phones are forbidden and wifi is not an option			1
now eleven weeks pregnant , she is worried for the health of her unborn baby as the condition makes her so ill. ms @entity5 suffered a miscarriage in november 2010 that she believes was triggered by being made to sit beneath fluorescent lights at work			1
she believes her condition was caused by using sunbeds every week as a teenager while under doctor 's orders to cure the skin condition psoriasis			1
now her condition is so severe she has been forced to quit working as a trainee solicitor			2
ms @entity5 , 34 , said : ' i 'm not a technophobe , i wanted an @entity12 just like everyone else			1
but within minutes of switching on the wifi router to go on the internet i felt really unwell			2
' i started to feel an intense build - up of pressure in my head and my digestive system was upset			2
i had a painful stomach and intense bloating			1
the symptoms only stopped when i turned it off			2
' i was diagnosed with psoriasis aged two and at the age of nine i started having phototherapy treatments , maybe about half a dozen a year , using @entity65 light			0
' then when i was 19 i bought a @entity67 / @entity66 for about Â£ 500 and i used to use it at home about once a week because i was young and i wanted to wear short skirts like other teens			0
' i never had any trouble with the sunbeds but then when i was about 25 , i bought a handheld light which was really powerful			0
if you held it against your skin for just 30 seconds you would burn but the idea was to build up a resistance so you could use it for a minute or so at a time			0
modern life ban : as ms @entity5 's partner is a a farmer the couple are able to live a rural existence away from the hazards of modern technology ' it allowed me to finally wear what i wanted and to go to the gym without having to be ashamed of my skin condition			1
but i think it 's what tipped my sensitivity over the edge			0
' ms @entity5 started working shortly after completing a law degree at the @entity96 but soon found that sitting under the fluorescent office bulbs made her ill. when her boss removed them , she felt much better but continued to be exposed to @entity102 waves outside work			1
following a miscarriage in november 2010 @entity5 decided to quit the job she loved			1
she was even forced to stop going to the gym as the fluorescent bulbs were ubiquitous wherever she went			2
energy saving lightbulbs at home also had a negative effect on her health and @entity5 had to revert back to the old - fashioned variety			1
she said : ' i loved the people i worked with and i loved my job but gradually the situation with the lights was getting worse and worse			2
@entity5 , now a full - time mum to @entity118 , three , said ' my boss was really understanding and at one point was going to fit the whole office with led lighting but i knew it was n't going to get any better			1
' in november 2010 i had a miscarriage and the whole time i had been pregnant the symptoms had been intensifying			1
when i lost the baby i was sure it had to be because of how ill i felt			0
i think my body had gone into attack mode			0
i wanted to carry on working but the miscarriage was the last straw			2
' banned list : in ms @entity5 's world cordless phones are banned , @entity12 are forbidden and mobile phones are not an option up to 5 per cent of the general population believe themselves to be affected by electro - or radiosensitivity and experience flu - like symptoms , headaches , lethargy and nausea when exposed to various electrical appliances			1
it is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the @entity149 , many medics are sceptical about electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome and research has not provided any official statistics			1
the condition is not officially recognised by the @entity155			1
@entity156 electromagnetic waves are everywhere and we are constantly bombarded by them from space			0
although there is no evidence of any permanent damage to the body from electromagnetic waves , some people have reported that they feel unwell when they are within reach of wi - fi or , occasionally , other types of electromagnetism			2
@entity171 , which @entity5 ca n't go near , uses the same type as mobile phones , tv and radio signals they are all different in wavelength , so have different properties			1
@entity171 waves are higher in frequency than mobile phones and are intense due to the amount of info they carry			2
so far research has not provided any official statistics			0
since then @entity5 has found it is not only lighting to which her body reacts			1
she gets pounding headaches if she uses a mobile phone for just a few minutes and has had to throw out all her cordless phones			1
in november 2011 she bought a @entity12 and turned on the wireless router within her home but within half an hour @entity5 was experiencing the familiar symptoms of her electrosensitivity and was forced to turn it off			1
she now can not go anywhere with wifi internet access as even a brief exposure leaves her bloated , sick and unable to function			0
she said : ' before buying the @entity12 i used to have a coping mechanism and i could go to @entity201 and have a coffee and i guess i just tolerated it			0
' but now i can feel the pressure building in my head and my stomach becomes sore and swollen			0
i would love to be able to go to a cafe or a restaurant with @entity31 but everywhere seems to have it these days , there 's no escape			0
' as her partner is a farmer the couple are able to live a rural existence away from the hazards of modern technology			0
however , gadgets are banned in the house and he has to do all of the errands in town so his partner can avoid wifi			1
ms @entity5 is now 11 weeks pregnant but after having a scare just a week ago is concerned her sensitivity to @entity102 waves could be affecting more than just her			2
she said : ' i had some very bad bleeding and i was sure i had miscarried again because of what happened the last time but thankfully the baby is fine			0
' a few days prior to that i had gone to my midwife appointment and there was wifi in the clinic			0
i was pretty ill that day and when i came home i started bleeding			0
' i ca n't take any chances now , i know i need to avoid wifi as much as i can			0
i know it makes me ill and i have to consider what it could be doing to the baby as well			0
' i 'm in a privileged position because i live in a rural area and at the moment it is possible for me to escape it but having found a @entity248 group dedicated to electrosensitivity i know others are not so lucky			2
' people who ca n't work like me do n't get any financial support like disability benefit			0
' there is lots of research out there about the effects these things have on our bodies and unfortunately it is not being listened to			0
my fear , for myself and for my kids , is that the technology is moving faster than our understanding of it			0
' @entity269 , spokesman for @entity270 , said : ' there are a now a significant number of people who appear to be sensitive to modern wireless technologies			0
' a minority of those suffer so severely that they have to resign from their job and move house to minimise their exposure			0
' unfortunately electrosensitivity is not recognised as a disability or a medical condition in the @entity149 , leaving these individuals with no way of financially supporting themselves or their families			1
