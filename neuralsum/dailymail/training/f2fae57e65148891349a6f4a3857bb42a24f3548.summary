it has barely changed in 100 years			1
but a proposed redesign for the dollar has left @entity3 up in arms			0
instead of the archetypal green and trusty old presidents , the revamped version would feature astronauts , molecules and stars in a series of motifs about innovation			1
@entity3 artist @entity13 , who developed the designs for his thesis at @entity17 's @entity16 , said : ' one day we @entity3 will make a significant move in our currency design that reinforces the evolution of our cultural climate ... this is where i would start '			1
controversial : an @entity3 artist has released these images for a proposed redesign of the dollar bill an aerial view of fields is printed on the proposed $ 5 bill			2
the $ 10 note , according to @entity13 , would feature a building or a molecule			2
new $ 20 bills would be adorned with a sparkling purple wave			0
moving up to $ 50 , we have an astronaut			0
and the peak of $ 100 is a mountain range or a starry sky			0
each bill is printed with similar font to the euro , with a muted gray border			0
muted : the paper notes would feature fields and molecules instead of revered presidents and dollar signs dramatic change : instead of the archetypal green , @entity13 would switch the bills to a light gray change : the artist , based in @entity17 , says currency should reflect the evolution of our cultural climate @entity13 was inspired by competitions held in @entity62 countries that let members of the public suggest new currency designs			1
' this idea of such a strong visual change every 20 years or so within a relatively conservative culture deeply rooted in banking lead me to ask , " why could n't the @entity3 do this ? " ' @entity13 told @entity72			1
' and subsequently , ' what would it look like if the @entity3 held such a competition ? ' ' responding to his critics , @entity13 insists the thesis was merely an attempt to inspire new designs			2
innovation : @entity13 was inspired by @entity3 innovation as well as @entity62 design features the big bucks : wealthy @entity3 could fill their wallets with mountain ranges and starry skies alternative : for those not fond of the nature photographs , he also fashioned scientific designs how it would work : for his thesis , @entity13 demonstrated the ways in which the note could work in practise ' i simply wanted to introduce the idea that there is still room to grow and innovate in @entity3 culture with currency , ' he told @entity72			1
' i 'm not declaring that this proposal is a suitable replacement for the usd as much as i 'm suggesting that one could exist , ' he said			0
he insists the idea is not ultramodern as it maintains paper form			0
but he assures his critics that it is ' transitional ' , not realistic			0
his inspiration came from @entity62 design movements of the 20th century and his observations since moving to @entity62			2
' i tried to tie the concept of learning , discovery , authorship , and accountability into the notes in a way that was aesthetically conducive to the organisation of information more than i worried if it looked too @entity62 or not " @entity3 " enough , ' @entity13 wrote			1
1914 : the first @entity122 $ 100 note is 7.3x3.1 inches with @entity124 on the front and figures on the back 1929 : it is reduced to 6.1x2.6 inches , @entity124 's portrait is changed , and @entity129 is put on the back 1990 - 1996 : in the first revamp in 70 years , the bill was marginally altered , keeping @entity124 and the @entity133 1996 - 2013 : @entity124 got a close - up six years later , when the numbers were made bold and borders straight 2013 - present : the @entity137 was added , as was a 3d security belt , in the latest redesign issued last year			1

artist @entity13 said we need currency that reflects evolved culture
waves , astronauts , mountains , molecules and buildings adorn his bills
the dollar has hardly changed in 100 years , *unlike* @entity62 currencies
