it was the worst performance i 've ever seen a @entity2 side put out ; we did n't want to fight or do the basics			1
' fair play to @entity4 , they came out and properly dug us out			1
' we were n't prepared to work hard enough			0
it 's ok when things are going well , we 've got good players then but when you want to fight and you want to knuckle down maybe we have n't got enough in the dressing room			2
the @entity15 midfielder and his teammates look on after conceding their fourth goal at @entity10 ' hopefully the manager has seen that today and will show it next week because it 's just not good enough ; as a team , as an 11			1
players did n't really want to be out there and you could see that after the first 10 minutes			0
credit to @entity4 they deserved to go through			2
