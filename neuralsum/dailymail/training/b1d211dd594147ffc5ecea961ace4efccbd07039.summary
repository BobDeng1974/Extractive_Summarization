by @entity0 published : 13:54 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 14:01 est , 13 february 2013 this image shows a mysterious dark cloud in distant space , which scientists from the @entity5 have decided looks just like a gecko			1
taken by the @entity9 at @entity5 ’s @entity10 in @entity11 it shows the bright star cluster @entity12 and its neighbour , the dark cloud @entity16			1
the cosmic pair is set against millions of glowing stars from the brightest part of the @entity20 — a region so dense with stars that barely any dark sky is seen across the picture			2
the @entity27 nebula : astronomers at the @entity5 released this image of dark could @entity16 86 today			1
they have decided that it looks like a gecko this part of the constellation of @entity35 ( @entity36 ) is one of the richest star fields in the whole sky — the @entity40			2
the huge number of stars that light up this region dramatically emphasise the blackness of dark clouds like @entity16 , which appears at the centre of this new picture , which was released today			1
this object - a small , isolated dark nebula known as a bok globule - was described as ' a drop of ink on the luminous sky ' by its discoverer @entity55			1
bok globules were first observed in the @entity57 by astronomer @entity58			0
they are very cold , dark clouds of gas and dust that often have new stars forming at their centres			0
these globules are rich in dust that scatters and absorbs background light , so they are almost opaque to visible light			0
in a paper published in 1947 , @entity70 and @entity71 hypothesised that these clouds were ' similar to insect 's cocoons ' that were undergoing gravitational collapse to form new stars			1
more recently near infrared observations confirmed that stars were being born inside them			0
they remain a subject of intense research			0
an exceptional visual observer and keen astro - photographer , @entity55 discovered and photographed numerous comets , dark nebulae , one of @entity90 ’s moons , and was the first to use long - exposure photography to explore dark nebulae			0
through a small telescope @entity55 86 looks like a dearth of stars , or a window onto a patch of distant , clearer sky			1
however , this object is actually in the foreground of the star field — a cold , dark , dense cloud made up of small dust grains that block starlight and make the region appear opaque			2
it is thought to have formed from the remnants of a molecular cloud that collapsed to form the nearby star cluster @entity12 , seen just to the left of @entity16 in this image			1
@entity12 is an open star cluster that contains many hot stars that glow bright blue - white , a tell - tale sign of their youth			0
open clusters usually contain a few thousand stars that all formed at the same time , giving them all the same age			0
such clusters usually only live comparatively short lives , on the order of several hundred million years , before drifting apart			0
judge for yourself : what a real gecko looks like the incredible number of stars in this area of the sky muddles observations of this cluster , making it difficult to learn much about it			0
@entity135 6520 ’s age is thought to be around 150 million years , and both this star cluster and its dusty neighbour are thought to lie at a distance of around 6000 light - years from our @entity140 the stars that appear to be within @entity16 in the image above are in fact in front of it , lying between us and the dark cloud			1
although it is not certain whether this is still happening within @entity16 , many dark nebulae are known to have new stars forming in their centres — as seen in the famous @entity155 , the striking object @entity156 and to a lesser extent in another of @entity55 ’s discoveries , the @entity161			1
however , the light from the youngest stars is blocked by the surrounding dusty regions , and they can only be seen in infrared or longer - wavelength light			0
as we gear up for the one day of the year dedicated to lovers , it seems that even the @entity169 has a romantic side			0
planetary nebula @entity171 gives the appearance of a red rose but is actually the remains of a dying star some 1,000 light years away			1
astronomers from the @entity179 @entity178 released the image on the eve of @entity182			1
our love is in the stars : the rose - like planetary nebula @entity186 a planetary nebula is created when a low - mass star blows off its outer layers at the end of its life			2
the core of the star remains and becomes an immensely dense white dwarf			0
usually the white dwarf is found right at the heart of the nebula , but in the case of @entity171 it is shifted to one side			2
in the image , it is the blue star near the right hand edge of the nebula , where the gas turns from red to blue			1
the image was taken using the @entity206 four - metre telescope at @entity207 in @entity208			2
observations were made through four different colour filters .			0

image was taken by @entity5 's @entity10 in @entity11 and released today
it shows the @entity16 86 , a small , isolated nebula known as a @entity70 globule
@entity179 astronomers publish picture of red rose nebula for @entity182
