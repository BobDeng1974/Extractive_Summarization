@entity0 is bidding to make history on thursday by winning its first @entity3 seat in the @entity4 by - election			1
the contest follows the resignation of the town ’s former @entity9 mp @entity8 over a ‘ cash - for - access ’ scandal			1
if @entity15 ’s candidate , @entity14 , overturns the @entity16 ’ 16,000 majority at the last election , it will cause an even bigger shock than @entity0 ’s @entity21 election triumph			1
in the words of @entity15 , the @entity0 fox will finally be let loose in the @entity25 hen - house			1
the stakes are equally high for @entity27			1
if conservative @entity29 wins , the prime minister can claim to have stopped mr @entity15 ’s ‘ @entity32 ’ in its tracks			1
if he loses , the prospect of continuing @entity0 support giving @entity35 the key to @entity37 at the next election will be all the more likely			1
@entity14 @entity16 defector who says nobody was offended by previous mp 's notorious ' black b * * * * * * * ' gaffe @entity15 may be @entity43 ’s best - known politically incorrect politician , but not for long if @entity0 ’s @entity14 wins the @entity4 by - election			1
his views on immigration , gays , catholic priests and same - sex marriage make @entity15 seem almost progressive			2
nearly as colourful are the brown - checked jacket , cream slacks and red - brown shoes he is wearing for our interview at a @entity57 cafe in @entity4 town square			2
unabashed : @entity14 , the candidate in this thursday 's parliamentary by - election in @entity4 mr @entity14 , who defected from the @entity9 two years ago and is now a @entity0 @entity21 mp , does n’t actually scoff when i suggest immigration has had benefits too , but his five - word reply , ‘ i like @entity65 restaurants too ’ , speaks for itself			1
a jaunty 70 , his moustache and dandyish wardrobe give him a ‘ @entity70 ’ - like air			2
in the mouth of the @entity74 ’s @entity73 , mr @entity14 ’s words would sound vile , but like mr @entity15 , he is so chirpy and brazen it is harder to take offence			1
he supports the repatriation of immigrants to their native countries			2
pruned image : @entity15 is seen as un-pc , but he 's nothing compared to his candidates ‘ if someone says , “ i came here , gave it a try , do n’t like it , ca n’t stand the weather , i ’d really like to go back to @entity87 but i ca n’t afford to go			2
” i ’d have no objection to taxpayers ’ money being used to assist them – but not forcibly , ’ he adds quickly			2
would the idea of a black or @entity96 prime minister of britain upset him ? ‘ i would n’t panic , ’ he says			2
‘ we had a woman @entity95 and i rather liked that ! ’ you can almost hear the ‘ arf arf @entity102 ’ at the golf club bar as he replies			2
he insists he is ‘ fairly relaxed ’ about gays , but maintains homophobia does not exist and accuses ‘ strident ’ gay rights groups of using it for political ends			2
‘ phobia is well defined in psychiatry – get a definition of it , ’ he barks			2
‘ we [ @entity0 ] do n’t deny there ’s prejudice against minorities , and we condemn it			2
however , it is n’t a phobia			2
when people say “ we support traditional marriage ” , @entity118 says , “ homophobia , homophobia ”			2
it ’s a perfectly respectable position to take , it does n’t require abuse and is n’t a phobia			2
’ @entity14 says the @entity125 should be allowed to spend money on helping homosexuals become straight			1
he says it is no different to @entity125 sex - change operations and , bizarrely , compares it to homeopathy			2
‘ one person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say , “ ok you can do it			0
” ‘ you have a homosexual who says , “ i ’m homosexual , actually i ’d rather be straight , is there a way of fixing it ? ” we say to the person who wants to change from a man to a woman or vice versa , “ please do that on the @entity125			0
” we say to this guy , “ that ’s wicked , you ’re not allowed to think about it			0
” ’ ‘ i do n’t know if homeopathy works or not , but i will defend the right of anyone who believes it works to try it			0
’ he insists he is ‘ taking a libertarian view ’			0
he opposes same - sex marriage			0
‘ marriage is defined by history , culture and reproductive biology and deserves special respect in society			0
( i am ) perfectly relaxed about other relationships but they do n’t justify the same respect			0
’ resigned : @entity16 mp @entity8 , pictured , was alleged to have asked questions in @entity168 for money and he claims the @entity170 is ‘ systematically paedophile ’			1
i ’m sure the @entity172 is a nice man			1
if a few people in the @entity175 are racist , people say it is institutionally racist ; if hundreds of catholic priests are paedophiles and i say they ’re paedophile , it ’s terrible			1
’ ex-newark @entity16 mp and former @entity32 officer @entity8 caused uproar when he said being called a ‘ black b * * * * * * ’ was a normal part of @entity32 life			1
@entity14 leaps to his defence			1
what ’s that line from @entity194 ? “ @entity189 men in barracks do n’t grow into plaster saints			0
” ’ mr @entity14 ’s critics say he is more sinner than saint			1
he wo n’t care if he wins in @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity198 of immigrants ‘ if someone says ‘ ‘ i came here , gave it a try , do n’t like the weather , i ’d really like to go back to @entity87 but i ca n’t afford to go ’ ’ , i ’d have no objection to taxpayers ’ money being used to assist them – but not forcibly ’ @entity125 treatment to ' cure ' gay people ‘ one person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say ‘ ‘ ok , you can do it ”			0
you have a homsexual who says ‘ ‘ i ’m homosexual , actually i ’d rather be straight , is there a way of fixing it ? ’ ’ ' @entity222 ' if a few people in the @entity175 are racist , people say it 's institutionally racist ; if i say hundreds of catholic priests are paedophiles , it 's terrible ' and on prospect of a black pm ' i would n't panic ' @entity29 @entity231 's director with top lawyer wife - they make no apologies for working hard for their money @entity16 candidate @entity29 rejects claims that he has covered up his and his wife ’s £ 5 million property portfolio and £ 500,000 - a - year joint earnings to try to win the @entity4 seat			1
mr @entity29 presents himself as a ‘ father , local man , son of a secretary and small businessman and state primary school - educated ’ candidate			1
but that is not quite the whole story			0
in fact , he and @entity251 wife @entity249 own not one , but two , £ 2 million homes in @entity255 and a £ 1 million country pile built by an 18th century slave - trader			0
their @entity4 ‘ home ’ is a rented house obtained when he was picked as a candidate six months ago			0
and his @entity261 omits to say he went to a £ 13,000 - a - year private secondary school			0
together with his director ’s job at @entity231 ’s auction house , it is just the type of posh @entity16 boy image @entity27 and co ca n’t shrug off			1
opponent : @entity29 ( left ) and his @entity271 flat ( right ) , one of two £ 2million @entity255 homes he owns mr @entity29 , who looks even younger than his 32 years , sticks rigidly to his @entity274 autocue when asked about national issues			1
during our interview at a cafeteria in @entity279 , near @entity4 , he is finally stirred when i ask whether , in his keenness to come across as a regular guy , he has misled voters			0
to win the candidacy , he promised he would move his family lock , stock and barrel to @entity4			0
a 250 - mile round - trip to @entity25 if he becomes mp – quite a commute for a self - proclaimed family man with two young daughters			0
wealthy : the @entity25 home owned by @entity29 how many nights has the family actually spent in their @entity4 ‘ home ? ’ ‘ er , it has grown over time			1
’ he wo n’t say			0
his election leaflets are also silent about the couple ’s £ 2 million flat in @entity271 , @entity255			0
it went up in value by £ 300,000 last year , more than twice the average price of a home in @entity4			0
last october , the couple splashed out an extra £ 2.5 million on a house in fashionable @entity307 , @entity25 , less than a mile from @entity168 , which they plan to move into soon			0
on top of that they bought @entity312 i listed @entity313 in @entity314 for £ 1.1 million in 2009			0
mr @entity29 says he is ‘ almost sure ’ they will sell it and move to @entity4 if he becomes mp			1
it is to be hoped this interview is not the first mrs @entity319 , a top commercial lawyer whose professional name is @entity321 , eight years mr @entity29 ’s senior , has heard of that			1
despite appearances , he says he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth , and cites his education at 500 - year - old independent school @entity327 as proof			0
‘ there was no way my parents could afford to send me to private school			0
my grandma @entity333 paid the fees			0
’ then why no mention of any of it in his @entity16 cv ? what does he know about life on the breadline ? ‘ that ’s not fair			1
none of it was inherited or handed on a plate to us			0
my wife and i have both worked jolly hard , ’ he insists			0
‘ i do n’t need to have a disabled daughter to know what it ’s like			0
pile : mr @entity29 's third home is a @entity353 in @entity354 , pictured ‘ i do n’t need to have lost a child in @entity356 to meet somebody who has and have empathy and support them			1
’ he could easily have carried on enjoying ‘ earning money and having nice homes ’ but sacrificed it all in a bid to become an mp			1
come off it , he can afford to because his wife earns approaching half - a - million a year with @entity251 law firm @entity366 and can pay all the bills			0
‘ i ’m not going to apologise for that			0
i ’m proud of her , ’ mr @entity29 says .			1

he says @entity170 is ' systematically paedophile ' but @entity172 is nice
@entity14 will be up against @entity16 @entity29 in tense *battle* on thursday
