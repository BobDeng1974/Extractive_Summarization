the breath of 40,000 worshipping @entity1 hung in the winter air			1
as did the plumes of purple - tinged grey smoke from @entity6 ’s wheel - screeching , crowd - pleasing car			1
the world champion was in @entity10 ’s heartland yesterday , a smile almost permanently worn wide			1
it was a night - and - day contrast to the taut bundle of tension he represented on the eve of the @entity16 , where he won a second world title with a quicksilver start that belied his nerves			2
this event , @entity21 , was the stage for @entity10 to share his success , and their world constructors ’ title , with the fans — the best in the world , as @entity6 describes them			1
@entity6 pictured celebrating after winning his second world championship title in @entity32 @entity6 pictured driving his @entity34 car at the @entity21 and @entity35 event in @entity1 never mind that he is @entity37 , @entity6 was given a warm reception			1
which is more than he got in some quarters back ‘ home ’ for waving the @entity42 in the air while living abroad to save on his tax bill			2
so will he leave his haven in @entity46 and return to @entity37 and the clutches of @entity49 ’s revenue raisers ? ‘ no , ’ he said , pointing to a happy lifestyle split mostly between the @entity51 and @entity52 , the home of his pop - star girlfriend @entity54			2
‘ i always go to the @entity56 in the winter			2
it ’s my favourite place , where i have my house			0
i ’ll get back to @entity46 and then i ’ll spend some time in the @entity37			0
i ’ll go and see my mum			0
‘ in @entity46 , i wake up with quite a nice view			0
it ’s generally beautiful weather when i wake up and i like being by the sea			0
‘ but , of course , i was born in @entity37 , so it ’s always like going home			0
you ’re going back to where you started			0
’ @entity6 ( left ) celebrating his achievements alongside his famous girlfriend , singer @entity54 ( right ) @entity6 in action during the final @entity73 of the season in @entity32 @entity6 was clearly overwhelmed and emotional immediately after securing his second world title the issue of nationality is a hot topic in @entity6 ’s next title assault — on the @entity80			1
@entity6 ’s chief rival for that honour is golf ’s @entity83 , the winner of two majors this season and a star of the @entity89			1
is living in your second tax exile — @entity46 after @entity92 — preferable in the public ’s estimation to having cast yourself away to @entity96 for the next @entity97 , as @entity83 has done ? the @entity99 vote on december 16 will give us some clue			0
next to @entity6 was his team - mate and a true national hybrid : @entity104 , who was born to a @entity106 father and a @entity1 mother and is domiciled in @entity46			1
he speaks five languages , supports @entity109 and competed for @entity106 before switching allegiance to @entity1 , probably for commercial reasons			1
@entity6 inspects the drum kit on stage at @entity115 event in @entity116 , @entity1 the @entity37 champion takes a selfie with a young fan during the annual celebration on saturday the two were more outwardly friendly than in recent months			1
‘ we were filming the other day and all the tension from the season disappeared			0
we can go back to being two normal individuals , talking about things that guys talk about , ’ said @entity6			1
can we be so sure ? this may be no more than a passing thaw			0
@entity104 , for all his bonhomie , must have hated moments of this party and will have revenge on his mind			1
‘ i have no regrets , ’ he said of a season that reached its controversial peak when he and @entity6 crashed			2
‘ but there are a few things i would do differently			0
it is often in difficult circumstances that we learn the most			0
’ the parade and interviews in and around the @entity10 museum was as @entity1 as @entity148			1
but there were reminders of the @entity152 connection			0
@entity104 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) have had a fractious relationship over the course of the seaosn @entity6 was sprayed in champagne after winning the @entity16 and the world championship not least in the form of sir @entity158 , who drove the museum ’s @entity159 , a silver 300 slr			1
as plain mr @entity158 he drove this car along 1,000 miles of open @entity164 road in 10 hours 7mins 48sec at an average speed of 98.98mph to win the @entity168 in 1955 — when @entity10 produced their last @entity170 world champion , @entity169			2
the laps of honour also continue for @entity6			2
he will drive his @entity173 on to the @entity175 stage in @entity176 on friday to collect the champion ’s trophy			0
he is also finalising an appearance at the @entity180 , when he is favourite for the international driver of the year prize , and will be at the @entity183 lunch			0
regardless of whether he wins the @entity80 gong , @entity185 ’s most famous @entity46 resident will collect plenty more silverware before @entity188 .			2

@entity6 is in @entity1 for @entity10 event
@entity6 is *nominated* for @entity80
@entity6 said relations between himself and @entity104 have *improved*
