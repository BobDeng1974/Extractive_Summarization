@entity0 might have just defeated the best arrow thrower in the sport ’s history and landed a £ 250,000 cheque but he plans to celebrate with nothing more extravagant than a day of home improvements			1
‘ i ’ll be getting some sleep and then i ’ll get my tool belt on at home to do some @entity10 , ’ he said , ‘ there ’s always something that needs doing around the house			0
’ the heavy hitter from @entity16 in the @entity18 borders came from behind to beat @entity19 and become his country ’s first world darts champion since @entity22 18 years ago			1
but he regained his composure to clinch the biggest win of his career , beating 16 - time champion @entity19 7 - 6 with a double 12 finish			1
‘ i ’m proud to be a @entity27 , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ i live in @entity53 now but it makes it a bit more special to win for my home country			1
it has n’t really sunk in yet			0
maybe by about wednesday or thursday i ’ll have realised what i ’ve done			0
’ the atmosphere was electric when @entity0 was introduced but it paled in comparison to the wall of noise that greeted @entity19 ’s arrival on the giant blue @entity65 stage			1
his signature tune @entity67 rang out as he applauded his adoring audience			0
the song by @entity71 group @entity69 was released just days before @entity19 won his first world title 25 years ago			1
his cheque for that victory was £ 12,000			2
the prince of the @entity76 uncharacteristically missed 55 shots at doubles but he believes he can disprove the doubters			0
‘ i ’m going to get better next year and that ’s a promise , ’ said @entity19 , ‘ i ’ll put things right			2
i will practise harder than ever			0
’ @entity0 arrives first and enjoys his hero 's welcome to the tune of @entity84 by @entity85 at @entity65 ' let 's have it won ' proclaims one of the hundreds of signs flashed as @entity0 took his walk - on the crowd at @entity65 were well behind @entity67 as the famous @entity69 blared through the hall @entity19 warms up ahead of the start of his attempt at a 17th @entity25 the walk - on girls vacate the stage with the pulsating action on the oche set to begin down to business , @entity27 is a model of focus in his bid for a first @entity25 @entity0 reacts after claiming the first set from the 16 - time world champion @entity19 reacts with a fired - up double finger salute as he hits back to win the second set @entity0 takes @entity19 's taunting in good spirits after he blew chances to race to a 2 - 0 lead the 54 - year - old legend of the game gives @entity0 's chin a little squeeze as the second set ended @entity19 's head drops as he missed the double that would level the match at two sets each this fan makes a monkey of himself at @entity65 as @entity0 and @entity19 do battle the packed crowd in @entity123 celebrate yet another 180 from the finalists @entity0 , competing in only his second @entity126 world championship final , betrayed no sign of nerves , starting the set with 120 and hitting the bullseye for a 121 finish			1
like all great champions , @entity19 raised his performance when on the ropes			2
a set and two legs down , he held his nerve to win the second set			0
celebrating by giving @entity0 a playful tickle on the chin was perhaps not befitting such a champion			2
it was the sort of immature provocation that , in reverse , @entity19 has been known to fume over but the @entity27 simply grinned			2
@entity0 raced to a 3 - 1 lead but @entity19 responded with a masterful display of throwing and nerveless finishing to comfortably take the fifth and sixth set and draw level			1
the momentum seemed to swing behind the @entity152 , who won the seventh set			0
@entity0 fought back to level at four sets apiece then somehow managed to win a drama - filled ninth set			1
first he went from 180 to zero in less than a second , knocking out his first two darts with his third			0
then came the dispute with a member of the crowd that saw @entity0 gesturing angrily towards the individual who was whistling at him as he was on the oche			2
on the charge , 44 - year - old @entity0 finishes another set with double tops to take a 3 - 1 lead over @entity19 and @entity19 , with work to do after @entity0 claimed a two set buffer , slumps as he leaves the stage the comeback was on though for @entity67 , as he steadied himself and showed sheer class to peg @entity0 back @entity0 suffered a string of bad luck , including three darts falling along with a purple patch from @entity19 as his lead disintegrated @entity0 manages a smile as @entity19 wins three sets on the bounce and nine of 10 legs to give himself a lead of 4 - 3 in the race to seven with glory prominently tattooed on his arm , @entity19 picks out a member of the crowd as he walks off stage with his first lead of the match a fan wearing lederhosen shows the scarf of @entity195 , a winter sports club in upper @entity196 in @entity71 the characters from @entity199 computer game stand out in the crowd , while one man gives @entity202 in @entity203 a nod @entity0 fans show their colours , through the woman on the right had other priorities on the night comedian and actor @entity211 ( left ) and boxer @entity212 ( right ) watch as @entity0 eventually delivers the knockout blow to @entity19 ‘ for a scotsman playing down in @entity123 the crowd have generally been fantastic , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i could n’t ask for more but he was ripping into me			0
i think he got his just reward by being asked to go home early so he missed the rest of the match			0
’ @entity0 composed himself and got back in front			2
then , playing on a new board after tournament director @entity223 ordered a replacement , he went two sets clear with a 98 checkout			0
gesturing towards @entity35 , who gave birth to his third son nine months ago , he seemed to signal that he had the win sewn up			0
that appeared to spur @entity19 into action as the 54 - year - old raced to victory in the 11th set			1
@entity19 played the sort of supreme pressure darts which have seen him amass career earnings of more than £ 6million to take them into a deciding set but even his greatness could not stop @entity0 rolling on to lift the trophy @entity241 's eye view ! @entity19 throws his @entity242 under the watchful eyes of a packed @entity65 @entity0 continues his love affair with double 20 that he enjoyed throughout the final @entity19 shows his anguish after missing a shot at double 12 to take a 5 - 3 lead the @entity67 walks away from the oche as @entity0 fights back to win the eighth set for 4 - 4 @entity0 happily takes the opening to bring the match back level at four sets all dancers entertain the crowd during a break in play in the party atmosphere of @entity65 @entity19 turns to the crowd after nailing another 180 during the @entity65 final but it was @entity19 who took a 5 - 4 lead after appearing visibly irritated by a member of the crowd the @entity27 then kept his composure to complete a 98 finish to take a 6 - 4 lead @entity0 picks another dart from the floor as his 6 - 4 lead is reduced to 6 - 5 in a flash but a resurgent @entity19			1

@entity0 won his first @entity25 in his second final
@entity19 ' @entity278 , in his 20th final , was *denied* his 17th title at @entity65
@entity0 claims the @entity281 and the £ 250,000 top prize after a 7 - 6 victory
