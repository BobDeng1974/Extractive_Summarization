@entity186 @entity185 , a defense attorney in @entity187 , @entity159 , said @entity0 's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments , perhaps dismissing them as a joke			2
' prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self - reflection , and i assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded , and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative , ' @entity185 said			0
' i do n't think it 's quite the smoking gun			0
' @entity0 — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family , whose @entity159 real estate empire is worth about $ 4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states			1
when @entity0 approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera , against the advice of his lawyers , he had already weathered one murder case , winning an acquittal in a gory @entity211 , @entity54 , dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self - defense			2

you 're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written			0
