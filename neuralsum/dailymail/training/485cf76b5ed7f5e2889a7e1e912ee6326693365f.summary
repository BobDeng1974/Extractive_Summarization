by @entity0 published : 18:24 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 19:40 est , 28 november 2013 cigarettes will be sold in white packets from may 2015 @entity3 accused @entity4 of performing a u-turn on a u-turn after ministers dramatically revived the prospect of forcing manufacturers to sell cigarettes in plain packaging			1
the prime minister caused fury in july when he appeared to kill off earlier plans to impose plain packaging , saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective			1
but in a surprise move , public health minister @entity17 yesterday announced that eminent paediatrician sir @entity19 has been asked to carry out a rapid review of the evidence by march – meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election			1
the change of heart was warmly welcomed by health campaigners , but tobacco companies said a ban would have no impact on legal smoking levels and would lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products			2
in the @entity34 , miss @entity17 said the government had ordered the review in response to evidence emerging from @entity39 , which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging			1
she said standardised packages would be brought in if ‘ we are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to proceed , including public health benefit ’			2
the options would then be considered including packs having a uniform colour or using graphic images of smoking - related diseases			2
miss @entity17 insisted that the @entity35 had made clear in july that it was simply taking a ‘ pause ’ , following a public consultation in 2012 , to consider the evidence from @entity39			1
but @entity55 health minister @entity54 said ministers had been forced to act by the prospect of a ‘ humiliating ’ defeat in the @entity59 on an amendment to the @entity61 tabled by a cross-party group of peers			1
@entity3 accused @entity4 of performing a u-turn on a u-turn after ministers dramatically revived the prospect of forcing manufacturers to sell cigarettes in plain packaging ‘ only a government as shambolic as this one could now be u-turning on a u-turn , ’ she said			1
‘ the minister says we need another review but the government have already had a review and the evidence is clear for all to see			2
standardised packaging makes cigarettes less attractive to young people			0
we should be legislating now , not delaying			0
’ some conservative mps accused the government of caving in to the ‘ nanny state brigade ’			0
@entity84 backbencher @entity83 said : ‘ what we expect from conservative ministers , who believe in individual freedom and individual responsibility , is to stand up to the health zealots and nanny state brigade who would ban everything and have everything in plain packaging if they could			1
’ yesterday , mr @entity4 ’s official spokesman denied the change of heart was a ‘ u-turn ’			2
shadow health minister @entity54 ( pictured ) said ministers had been forced to act by the prospect of a ' humiliating ' defeat in the @entity59 on an amendment to the @entity103 tabled by a cross-party group of peers ‘ what the @entity35 said in the summer was that we would keep this under review , that we would be looking at the emerging evidence – and that ’s exactly what the review we ’ve announced will do , ’ he said			1
last night @entity113 , chief executive of @entity115 , praised the government for ‘ great leadership ’ and said the move would save thousands of lives			0
he added : ‘ stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation			0
‘ tobacco is a unique product			0
it is the only consumable that , when used in the way the manufacturer intends , kills half of its users			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity134 yesterday admitted that he was an underage smoker who illegally bought cigarettes			0
he told listeners to his @entity137 phone - in show that his early take - up of smoking was a result of peer pressure			0
he added : ‘ it was all the boys and girls in my year [ who ] were smoking			0
