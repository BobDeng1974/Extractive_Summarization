by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 10:18 est , 3 october 2012 @entity1 was told to give her daughter @entity3 a two - year - old girl who died after she was wrongly diagnosed with swine flu was failed by emergency services , a coroner has said			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , died from a meningitis - like infection following the incorrect diagnosis at the height of the 2009 national pandemic			2
the inquest in @entity9 heard that paramedic @entity16 had examined her at home but sent an ambulance away because it was ' another case of swine flu '			1
four hours later , following a second 999 call , the toddler was rushed to hospital where she died			2
returning a narrative verdict today , @entity23 coroner @entity22 ruled @entity25 died following an ' erroneous diagnosis ' and the fact she was not immediately admitted to hospital reduced her chances of survival and contributed to her death			1
he said : ' she died from a condition that was previously undiagnosed and the examination by @entity36 was inadequate and deficient and there was a failure to recognise the severity of her condition			0
' is is possible @entity36 was over-influenced by the fact there was at the time a prevalence of swine flu ? ' there is no doubt at all that @entity25 should have been sent to hospital immediately and she would have had a better chance of survival			1
' a fantastic girl : @entity25 was misdiagnosed with swine flu when she was suffering from meningitis @entity25 's parents ( pictured left ) @entity56 and @entity1 have spoken out to highlight a catalogue of failings that led to the death of their daughter @entity25 ( pictured right ) he added that the @entity61 had already taken action to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies			1
earlier in the hearing it was suggested @entity25 ’s death on august 4 , 2009 was the result of meningitis			2
today , pathologist @entity70 said a post-mortem showed she died from a group a streptococcal infection , a rare form of blood poisoning which can develop into meningitis			0
@entity25 was first seen by @entity36 at about midday on august 4 , 2009 following a 999 call			2
her mother , @entity1 , said she had initially felt relieved that she had been diagnosed and given the swine flu medication @entity80			1
@entity25 ’s father , @entity56 , said he had been reassured it was not life - threatening			2
but her condition continued to deteriorate and ms @entity1 again dialled 999 shortly before 4pm			0
@entity25 was pronounced dead at the @entity23 and @entity83 at 4.24pm			1
@entity25 was taken to the @entity23 and @entity83 , but she was pronounced dead on arrival meningitis symptoms to look out for professor @entity87 told the inquest that , on the balance of probabilities , it was likely @entity25 would have survived if she had been taken to hospital sooner			1
he added : ' the diagnosis of swine flu was clearly inappropriate			1
the circumstances here go far outside what any clinician would diagnose as swine flu			1
if it was swine flu , it was swine flu with complications			1
' dr @entity104 , a paediatric and intensive care consultant who examined the circumstances around her death , said “ red flag ” warning signs were missed			0
paramedic @entity16 said she visited the family 's home and made the swine flu diagnosis after a 45 - minute examination he added : ' i would not necessarily have expected an emergency care practitioner to have diagnosed the illness but it is more important to recognise the severity of the condition			1
' the failure of an emergency care practitioner to recognise the severity of @entity25 ’s illness resulted in her having a reduced chance of surviving the illness			2
' miss @entity16 yesterday told the hearing she regretted the incorrect diagnosis but said “ most clinicians ” would have made the same mistake given the unprecedented circumstances			0
she described how medics had been ' distracted ' by the pandemic			0
' swine flu was at the forefront of everybody ’s mind			2
had that not been a factor i would have been looking at other reasons , ' she said			0
speaking outside the inquest , mr @entity56 said the last three years had been like " going through hell "			0
but he said the family accepted that the ambulance service had learnt from the mistake			0
he added : ' we were failed by one person and we ca n't blame the whole @entity149 for that			0
' he and ms @entity1 issued a statement saying : ' nobody knows a child like their parents and we are saddened that despite our best instincts the ambulance service failed to provide adequate care to @entity25			2
' we are pleased the ambulance service has apologised for the failings of its emergency care practitioner - we are only sorry that it has taken three years			0
' speaking after the inquest , dr @entity163 , medical director and deputy chief executive at the @entity165 , offered her " deepest condolences " to @entity25 's family			1
she added many children with fever and a rash are safely seen , treated and left at home			0
dr @entity163 said the ambulance service had apologised for the shortcomings and was pleased the coroner had acknowledged the progress that had been made			0
' in @entity25 's case we accept that , although the paramedic carried out an assessment and followed national guidance , she could have identified the potential for @entity25 to become more seriously ill and arranged urgent admission to hospital , ' dr @entity163 said			1
' she has since undergone a period of retraining and evaluation and has returned to frontline duties			0
' this is a difficult area for all healthcare professionals involved in the assessment of children in the community and , as in this case , sadly there is occasionally a tragic outcome			0
' since @entity25 's death the @entity165 have taken additional steps to help our staff recognise and manage seriously ill children			1
' we are the leading ambulance service in the @entity203 to work with the international @entity205 campaign , which promotes the early identification and treatment of sepsis			0
