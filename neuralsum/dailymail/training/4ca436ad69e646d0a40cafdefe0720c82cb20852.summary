by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 19:30 est , 27 december 2012 @entity2 student @entity1 set out to determine how to help turtles cross the road			1
he ended up getting a glimpse into the dark souls of some humans			0
@entity1 put a realistic rubber turtle in the middle of a lane on a busy road near the @entity13 campus			1
then he got out of the way and watched over the next hour as seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal			1
several more apparently tried to hit it but missed			1
cruel intentions : @entity2 student @entity1 holds a fake turtle he placed in a busy road to see how many drivers would intentionally swerve to hit it ' i 've heard of people and from friends who knew people that ran over turtles			1
but to see it out here like this was a bit shocking , ' said @entity1 , a 22 - year - old senior in @entity2 's @entity33			1
to seasoned researchers , the practice was n't surprising			2
the number of box turtles is in slow decline , and one big reason is that many wind up as roadkill while crossing the asphalt , a slow - and - steady trip that can take several minutes			0
sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant species on this planet by taking a two - ton metal vehicle and squishing a defenseless creature under the tires , said @entity51 , a @entity52 psychology professor			1
' they are n't thinking , really			1
it is not something people think about			0
it just seems fun at the time , ' @entity51 said			1
' it is the dark side of human nature			0
' waiting : as the orange - shelled turtle rests in a road near the @entity13 campus , @entity1 , right , talks with his professor , @entity65 , left , as they wait to see if any cars will hit it @entity51 asked a class of about 110 students getting ready to take a final whether they had intentionally run over a turtle , or been in a car with someone who did			1
thirty - four students raised their hands , about two - thirds of them male , said @entity51 , author of a book about humans ' relationships with animals , called ' some we love , some we hate , some we eat			0
' @entity1 , who became interested in animals and conservation through the @entity86 and @entity89 's ' @entity88 ' @entity87 , wants to figure out the best way to get turtles safely across the road and keep the population from dwindling further			0
among the possible solutions : turtle underpasses or an education campaign aimed at teenagers on why drivers should n't mow turtles down			1
the first time @entity1 went out to collect data on turtles , he chose a spot down the road from a big apartment complex that caters to students			2
he counted 267 vehicles that passed by , seven of them intentionally hitting his rubber reptile			2
he went back out about a week later , choosing a road in a more residential area			0
he followed the same procedure , putting the fake turtle in the middle of the lane , facing the far side of the road , as if it was early in its journey across			2
the second of the 50 cars to pass by that day swerved over the center line , its right tires pulverizing the plastic shell			0
' wow ! that did n't take long , ' said @entity1			2
shattered : the shattered plastic shell rests beside the rubber turtle after seven drivers swerved and deliberately ran over the animal in the first half hour			1
several others tried and missed other cars during the hour missed the turtle			1
but right after his observation period was up , before @entity1 could retrieve the model , another car moved to the right to hit the animal as he stood less than 20 feet away			2
' one hit in 50 cars is pretty significant when you consider it might take a turtle 10 minutes to cross the road , ' @entity1 said			1
running over turtles even has a place in @entity144 lore			0
in @entity13 author @entity147 's semi-autobiographical novel ' @entity146 , ' a fighter - pilot father squishes turtles during a late - night drive when he thinks his wife and kids are asleep			0
his wife confronts him , saying : ' it takes a mighty brave man to run over turtles			0
' the father denies it at first , then claims he hits them because they are a road hazard			0
' it 's my only sport when i 'm traveling , ' he says			0
' killed off : an @entity162 is seen in a yard in @entity164 while their population is said to be steadily dwindling with turtles taking seven or eight years to become mature enough to reproduce that hobby has been costly to turtles			0
it takes a turtle seven or eight years to become mature enough to reproduce , and in that time , it might make several trips across the road to get from one pond to another , looking for food or a place to lay eggs			1
a female turtle that lives 50 years might lay over 100 eggs , but just two or three are likely to survive to reproduce , said @entity1 's professor , @entity65			1
snakes also get run over deliberately			2
@entity65 wishes that were n't the case , but he understands , considering the widespread fear and loathing of snakes			2
but why anyone would want to run over turtles is a mystery to the professor			2
' they seem so helpless and cute , ' he said			0
' i want to stop and help them			0
my kids want to stop and help them			0
my wife will stop and help turtles no matter how much traffic there is on the road			0
i ca n't understand the idea why you would swerve to hit something so helpless as a turtle			1

placing a rubber turtle in a busy intersection the @entity2 student witnessed seven drivers deliberately hit it in the first half hour
several other drivers tried to hit it also in that time frame but missed
psychology professor : ' they are n't thinking *...* it just seems fun at the time '
