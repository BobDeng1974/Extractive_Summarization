by @entity0 published : 21:47 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 5 march 2013 a woman paid $ 22,000 to have a @entity4 couple 's baby fled across the country and had the child after refusing their instructions to abort it when ultrasound scans revealed a series of disabilities			1
five months into the pregnancy last year , surrogate mother @entity13 was told the bad news by doctors - beginning a tragic and heartbreaking ordeal for her and the baby 's parents			1
following a legal battle with the parents , @entity13 , 29 , flew to @entity22 to give birth according to @entity24 , leaving the child to be fostered , instead of being raised by either herself or the intended parents			1
scroll down for @entity27 @entity28 and the parents of the child she was carrying went through an exhaustive legal battle after she refused to abort the baby she was carrying in august of 2011 , @entity13 , who has two children of her own , fell into financial difficulties and offered her services through an established surrogacy agency to a couple who desperately wanted a fourth child but could n't have one			1
they paid $ 22,000 to @entity13 and then an embryo the pair had left over from a previous round of in - vitro fertilization was used on october 8th			1
just ten days later @entity13 fell pregnant and the thrilled couple asked to be as involved as possible throughout the following nine months			2
the would - be mother phoned daily to offer morning sickness sympathy and gave @entity13 and her two daughters @entity48 presents and even paid out the monthly surrogate fee early to help her out			1
' she said , ' i want you to come to us with anything because you 're going to be part of our lives forever , ' said @entity13 to @entity24			2
in february though , everything changed when ultrasound tests began to show that the baby was not developing as was hoped			0
@entity13 became pregnant in october 2011 and at first enjoyed a healthy relationship with the parents disaster struck though in the fifth - month of the pregnancy when a scan revealed the unborn child had significant abnormalities including a cleft lip and palate ( pictured ) doctors suspected that the baby had a cleft lip and palate , a cyst in her brain and serious heart defects			1
they could n't even see a stomach or a spleen			0
on february 16th , 2012 , with the parents at the ultrasound with @entity13 , their worst fears were confirmed			1
physicians at @entity83 said the baby would need several surgeries after birth and had only a 25 per cent chance of living a normal life			0
after this bombshell news , a letter was sent to @entity13 's midwife , in which dr @entity92 , a maternal fetal medicine specialist at @entity83 , and @entity94 , a genetic counselor , outlined the parents ' wishes			2
' given the ultrasound findings , ( the parents ) feel that the interventions required to manage ( the baby 's medical problems ) are overwhelming for an infant , and that it is a more humane option to consider pregnancy termination , ' they wrote according to @entity24			1
however , @entity13 , who is staunchly religious , disagreed and said that ' all efforts should be made to give the baby a chance '			2
for the parents though , who had gone through three previous premature births that left two of their children with medical problems , the abortion was the most humane option			1
@entity13 refused to have an abortion - setting into motion a series of legal battles which led to her fleeing the state of @entity4 for @entity22 @entity83 : the scan of the unborn child was performed here in february of 2012 but the disagreement turned sour and developed into an emotional stand - off between the parents and @entity13			1
' they said they did n't want to bring a baby into the world only for that child to suffer			0
... they said i should try to be @entity135 - like and have mercy on the child and let her go , ' said @entity13 to @entity24			2
' i told them that they had chosen me to carry and protect this child , and that was exactly what i was going to do , ' said @entity13			0
' i told them it was n't their decision to play @entity135			0
' unsure of their legal rights , the parents were stunned to discover that only @entity13 could arrange and go through with an abortion			2
but the couple soon let @entity13 's agency at @entity153 know that if she brought the pregnancy to term they would n't be the baby 's legal parents - leaving the child to her			1
@entity13 questioned whether she wanted to become a mother again , especially since the only income she could count on was the surrogacy fee and child support from her own daughters ' father			2
@entity164 from @entity153 explained to @entity13 the realities of bringing up a disabled child and said the parents would pay her $ 10,000 to have the termination			2
@entity13 refused - demanding $ 15,000 to have an abortion			1
@entity13 already had two daughters of her own and left for @entity171 in @entity22 to have the child - which she arranged to give up for adoption in that state claiming this was a moment of weakness , @entity13 told @entity24 that she immediately regretted the counter-offer , which was totally refused by the parents			1
with the 24 - week legal limit for a termination rapidly approaching , the desperate couple hired a lawyer			0
' you are obligated to terminate this pregnancy immediately , ' wrote @entity187 , an attorney in @entity188 , @entity4			0
' you have squandered precious time			0
' he reminded her that she had signed a contract agreeing to ' abortion in case of severe fetus abnormality '			0
but the contract did not stipulate what this meant			0
@entity187 said she was in breach of contract and that if she did not abort she would be sued for the money already paid , which was $ 8,000 and the medical fees and legal fees to date			2
hiring her own lawyer , @entity205 , an attorney in @entity206 , @entity4 , @entity13 fought back by sticking to her resolution not to have the abortion			2
however , the story took another turn when the parents changed their minds and said they would now exercise their legal rights to take custody of the child - but after the birth would surrender her to the state of @entity4 for foster care			1
after a difficult birth - @entity219			0
was born in june and was handed over for adoption after @entity13 and the child 's parents came to a legal agreement at this point , @entity205 explained to his client that the law was firmly on the parents ' side			1
however , @entity13 now decided that she could n't stand the thought of the baby in foster care			1
running out of options , @entity13 was advised that she could go to a state where the birth - mother , and not the genetic parents , would be considered the legal guardian			1
so , on april 11th , in her seventh month of pregnancy , @entity13 moved her daughters to @entity22 and only as she was driving away told her attorney to inform the couple of her plans			2
' once i realized that i was going to be the only person really fighting for her , that mama bear instinct kicked in , and there was no way i was giving up without a fight , ' said @entity13 to @entity24			0
choosing @entity22 to have the baby was also a medical decision too - @entity251 at the @entity252 has one of the best pediatric heart programs in the country			1
once firmly established in a small , cheap , sub-let in @entity171 , @entity13 came to another realization - she could not keep the child , but she would give the child up for adoption in @entity22			1
locating a couple who wanted to take on a special needs child , @entity13 prepared to come to term and hand the child over			0
@entity265 will need years of medical attention and operations to cure the problems she was born with with one month to go , the parents filed an order in @entity271 that they wanted to be the legal guardians - but they were forced to admit that the wife was not the baby 's genetic mother as an anonymous egg donor had been used			1
as this latest legal battle was thrashed out in court , the child , a girl , was born on june 25th weighing six pounds , with @entity13 's name on the birth certificate			0
three weeks passed until both sides came to an understanding - the father gave up his paternal rights so long as he and his wife could keep in touch with the @entity22 adoptive parents			1
in the seven months since , the couple have visited the child known as @entity265 and held her in their arms			0
' they do care about her well - being			0
they do care about how she 's doing , ' the unnamed adoptive mother said to @entity24			2
but the child 's medical problems have become far more serious than the ultrasound back in @entity4 first revealed			1
@entity301 with her adoptive mother ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) aged seven - months old and now living in @entity22 the seven - month - old child has a birth defect called holoprosencephaly , where the brain does n't completely divide into distinct hemispheres			1
she also has a condition called heterotaxy , which means many of her internal organs , such as her liver and stomach , are in the wrong places in her body			0
her head is small , her right ear is deformed , she has a cleft lip and a cleft palate , and a long list of complex heart defects			0
she 's had one open - heart surgery and surgery on her intestines , and over the next year she 'll have one or two more cardiac surgeries			0
if the child , named @entity265 for legal reasons , does survive , there 's a 50 per cent chance she wo n't be able to walk or talk			0
as far as @entity13 is concerned though , she did the right thing , even though some people have sent her hate messages through her blog , @entity332			0
' i ca n't tell you how many people told me that i was bad , that i was wrong , that i should go have an abortion , that i would be damned to hell , ' she said			0
' no matter what anybody told me , i became her mother			0
