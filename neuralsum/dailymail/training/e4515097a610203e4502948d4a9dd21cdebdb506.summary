ms @entity7 , a professional weaver , feared a tree had fallen onto the workshop of her property in @entity14 , near @entity15 , @entity16			1
shock : @entity18 was stunned when two cows fell through the roof of her home as she cleaned , causing thousands of pounds of damage gaping : the hole left in the roof of @entity7 's workshop after the cows plummeted through the ceiling of her converted barn however , when the 77 - year - old entered the room she saw a cow stood in the workshop after it fell through her roof and flattened a table and chairs			1
ms @entity7 managed to shoo the beast out of her property , but just minutes later a second cow , who had followed the first , fell through another part of the roof			2
the two animals crushed the majority of the furniture in the room but narrowly avoided the weaver 's expensive loom			2
wild cow chase : ms @entity7 with one of the cows which fell through the roof of her workshop ms @entity7 said : ' i was hoovering at the time and heard an almighty crash			1
i assumed that a tree had come down			0
' i was astonished to find that a cow had fallen through the roof of the workshop , narrowly missing my loom and leaving a huge hole in the roof			1
' no sooner had i let the startled animal out than another one fell through another part of the roof			0
' both cows narrowly missed the loom , which was incredibly fortunate , and neither was injured			0
i was in absolute shock			0
' the animals had been grazing in a neighbouring farmer 's field before they climbed onto the sloped roof to get to greener grass			1
mrs @entity7 said the first cow was ' extremely eager ' to leave and ran out the back door - but its companion was more reluctant to go			2
she added : ' the cows were clearly distressed , the first careered out of the yard into an adjacent field , the second decided to hang around and made a bit of mess of the garden			0
' i looked up at the fence and saw the rest of the herd looking on , a helpful neighbour came to our aid and made sure no more came through the fence			0
' the two cows caused thousands of pounds worth of damage but luckily ms @entity7 was able to make a claim was against the farmer 's insurance			1
@entity93 , managing director of insurers @entity94 , said : ' this very unusual case really does highlight the importance of keeping boundary fences in good condition			0
damage : the animals tore a hole through the roof of ms @entity7 's workshop and flattened much of her furniture , although fortunately they missed her expensive loom ' fortunately no one was physically harmed and neither of the cows suffered any injuries			1
' livestock owners are potentially liable through common law and statute for accidents caused by animals straying , so land or animal owners should ensure that all fences are kept in reasonable order at all times			0
' the farmer responsible for the cows has now put a new fence in place to stop further animals trying to escape .			0
