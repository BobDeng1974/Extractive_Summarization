if @entity7 gets his £ 350,000 claim written off , it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges the @entity11 heard			1
mr @entity7 , 54 of @entity12 , @entity13 , is asking the court to rule his matrimonial debt did not ‘ survive ’ his declaration of bankruptcy in 2006			1
legal history : if @entity7 ( right ) gets his claim that he is unable to pay maintenance to his ex-wife @entity22 ( left ) because he is bankrupt , it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges he was once the head of a multi-million pound company who separated from his wife @entity22 in 2003			1
under their divorce agreement , she was given their marital house and mr @entity7 agreed to pay her more than £ 500,000 in instalments			2
mrs @entity22 , who lives in a £ 500,000 house in @entity36 , @entity37 , had received £ 211,000 of that money before her ex-husband fell on hard times and declared himself bankrupt			1
mrs @entity22 , who is a director of a chauffeur - driven car hire company , now wants the remaining £ 349,000 he still owes her from the divorce settlement but this is ‘ impossible ’ for mr @entity7 now , the court heard			1
his bankruptcy was discharged in september 2007 and mr @entity7 later re-established himself as ceo of an international baggage handling firm , although his barrister , @entity49 , said ‘ the curtain has come down ’ on that venture			2
his ex-wife was registered as a creditor in his bankruptcy and mr @entity49 said that mr @entity7 feared he will be again bankrupted if his debt to mrs @entity22 is not expunged			1
acknowledging that the case raises a ‘ novel point ’ of potentially huge significance , mr @entity49 told the judge : ‘ mr @entity7 ' financial position is such as to make any chance of a payment of £ 349,000 impossible now , or in the foreseeable future			2
‘ mrs @entity22 ' financial circumstances , as is clear , are far more comfortable than her ex-husband 's			0
’ ‘ neither mr or mrs @entity22 have had any real contact with each other or any knowledge of each other ’s dealings since 2003			0
’ although mrs @entity22 ‘ challenges the veracity of her ex-husband 's financial status , ’ mr @entity49 insisted that ‘ a full scale change in his financial circumstances ’ had taken place			2
' further reflection ' : justice @entity76 said at the @entity11 ( pictured ) that the case ' raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction ' @entity82 , representing mrs @entity22 , warned the judge that a ruling in mr @entity7 ’ favour could create a legal loophole for exploitation by unscrupulous spouses			1
it would be ‘ opening the door to all the bankrupts out there who do n't want to pay their lumps sums in family proceedings , ’ mr @entity82 said			0
mr @entity96 said : ‘ i do n't want to do anything that suggests that so long as you go into bankruptcy that is the gateway to avoiding the family court 's orders			0
there are lots and lots of husbands and wives who are company directors			0
‘ the default position is that , although the bankrupt gets a new start in life , he still has round his neck orders made in family proceedings for lump sums and costs			0
’ ‘ if the on - going order was made as a crystal ball assessment of the parties ' needs , it may well be that the bankruptcy court can take those changing needs into account			0
’ mr @entity96 said the case ‘ raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction ’ and that ‘ there is a point which possibly needs some further reflection ’			0
the decision on the case was reserved until a later date			0
neither mr @entity7 nor mrs @entity22 made any comment outside court .			1

@entity7 hopes to have his £ 350,000 claim of maintenance payments written off because he says it did not ' survive ' his bankruptcy
his ex-wife @entity22 received £ 211,000 from him before payments stopped and now wants the remainder
if the judge rules in mr @entity148 's favour , it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges , the court heard
