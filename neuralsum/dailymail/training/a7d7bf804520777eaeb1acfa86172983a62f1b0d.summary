@entity0 is getting back 112 wins wiped out during the @entity3 child molestation scandal and the late @entity4 has been restored as the ' winningest coach ' in major college football history			1
the @entity7 announced the new settlement with the school weeks before a scheduled trial on the legality of the 2012 consent decree it will replace			2
the new deal also directs a $ 60 million fine to address child abuse be spent within @entity17 and resolves that lawsuit			2
the @entity0 board approved it friday afternoon			0
the announcement follows the @entity7 's decision last year to reinstate the school 's full complement of football scholarships and let @entity0 participate in post-season play , and comes just days after a federal judge declined to rule on the consent decree 's constitutionality			1
the @entity7 said continuing the litigation would only delay the distribution of funds to sex abuse survivors			1
' while others will focus on the return of wins , our top priority is on protecting , educating and nurturing young people , ' said @entity47 , @entity48 president and member of the @entity7 board			2
the consent decree sprung from the scandal that erupted when @entity3 , a retired football assistant coach , was accused of sexually abusing boys , some of them on @entity0 's campus			1
it had eliminated all wins from 1998 - when police investigated a mother 's complaint that @entity3 had showered with her son - through 2011 , @entity4 's final season as head coach after six decades with the team and the year @entity3 was charged			1
in september , the @entity7 announced it was ending the school 's ban on post-season play and restored its full complement of football scholarships earlier than scheduled			1
the restored wins include 111 under @entity4 , who died in 2012 , and the final victory of 2011 , when the team was coached by defensive coach @entity74			1
it returns @entity4 's record to 409 - 136 - 3			2
the consent decree had also called for @entity0 to provide $ 60 million to fight child abuse and combat its effects			2

under the settlement , the money will remain in @entity17			0
as part of the new proposal , @entity0 acknowledges the @entity7 acted in good faith			2
' we acted in good faith in addressing the failures and subsequent improvements on @entity0 's campus , ' said @entity104 , member of the @entity7 board of governors			1
' we must acknowledge the continued progress of the university while also maintaining our commitment to supporting the survivors of child sexual abuse			1
' the 2012 consent decree was signed by @entity0 's then - president , @entity112 , a month after a jury convicted @entity3 and shortly after former @entity115 director @entity114 released the scathing results of a university - commissioned investigation into the @entity3 matter			1
its unprecedented penalties drew heated and sustained opposition by @entity0 alumni and fans who argued the @entity114 report was factually incorrect , defended @entity4 's handling of the @entity3 scandal , noted it punished people who had nothing to do with @entity3 and said that the school 's athletics program had been considered a national model			1
in recent months , emails and other documents have been attached to court filings by the @entity7 and the plaintiffs , state senate majority leader @entity137 and state treasurer @entity136			0
in one , an @entity7 official described its pursuit of the penalties as ' a bluff ' and said asserting jurisdiction would be ' a stretch			0
' other records documented that @entity0 narrowly avoided a multi-year ' death penalty ' which would have suspended the college football powerhouse from playing at all			0
@entity137 signed off on the proposal , the senator said at a news conference in @entity150			0
' the fact of the matter was , an evil predator operated in our community for years and everyone missed it , ' @entity137 said			0
' the @entity7 has surrendered			0
the agreement we reached represents a complete victory for the issue at hand			0
' @entity136 supports the agreement in principle , but he ' intends to carry out a careful review of the details and language before he signs off , ' said his spokesman @entity168			0
@entity3 was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts and he is now serving a 30 - to 60 - year prison sentence			1
@entity4 's surviving family members and others had been pursuing another lawsuit over the consent decree			0
that lawsuit was narrowed by the judge so that it now includes the family , former assistant coaches @entity180 and @entity181 , and former trustee @entity182			0
former players , faculty and trustees were removed as plaintiffs			0
in a statement , @entity4 's family called the announcement of a potential settlement ' a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the @entity3 tragedy			1
' in this november 15 , 2014 photo , a banner celebrating the 409 wins of former @entity0 football coach @entity4 waves over the parking lot outside @entity200 before an @entity7 college football game @entity202 , a @entity0 running back from 1976 to 1979 , called the new deal ' a step in the right direction ' to vindicating @entity4 - the late coach ' was a great leader , a great coach and a great man , ' @entity202 said they said : ' this case should always have been about the pursuit of the truth , not the unjust vilification of the culture of a great institution and the scapegoating of coaches , players and administrators who were never given a chance to defend themselves			1
' @entity221 , a lawyer for one of the victims who testified at @entity3 's trial , said he favored restoring @entity0 's scholarships and bowl eligibility last fall , but does not believe @entity4 's victories should be reinstated			1
' to completely restore , in a sense , @entity4 's heretofore pristine reputation , i regret that , ' @entity221 said			0
' he did a world of good , but he made a huge , huge error in judgment in helping cover up @entity3 's pedophilia , and even posthumously i think that has to be recognized			0
' @entity221 praised @entity0 in its dealings with the victims but said he sensed a ' shift in the tide ' later			0
' there was a movement away from what i thought was a genuine mea culpa on the part of @entity0 , having accepted the @entity7 sanctions , and one toward , " why did we cave so easily ? " that was disappointing , ' he said			2
@entity202 , a @entity0 running back from 1976 to 1979 , called the deal ' a step in the right direction ' to vindicating @entity4			2
the late coach ' was a great leader , a great coach and a great man , ' @entity202 said			0
' he needs to be looked upon in that light			0
' the deal infuriated some @entity0 alumni who have long contended the @entity7 had no authority to punish @entity0 over the @entity3 scandal , and who were in favor of a trial .			1

in 2011 , following a two - year grand jury investigation , retired @entity0 coach @entity3 was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys over a 15 - year period from 1994 to 2009
the following year @entity0 received a $ *60m* fine , lost all wins from the last 14 years and @entity4 was *stripped* of his ' winningest coach ' title
it has now been announced that these punishments will be *canceled*
the move follows the @entity7 's decision last year to reinstate the school 's full complement of football scholarships
it said continuing litigation would only delay the distribution of funds to sex abuse survivors
