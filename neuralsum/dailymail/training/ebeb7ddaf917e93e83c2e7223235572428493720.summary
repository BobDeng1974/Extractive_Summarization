as part of the study , researchers interviewed 200 families with children aged three and four			2
they found 37 per cent of these children used the internet via a pc or laptop – and 3 per cent even surfed the web using a mobile phone			2
the youngsters also watched around 15.5 hours of television a week and spent 6.2 hours a week playing games online – but no figures were collected for the time they spent surfing the web			2

the figure rises for those in their early teens , with 80 per cent saying they have a social networking profile with an average of 286 friends			0
