by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 when four @entity7 friends ' go for an @entity8 ' in hit comedy show @entity4 , they ordered their food ' extra , extra bland '			0
the hilarious spoof sketch turned the tables on @entity14 who love to ' go for a curry ' and ask for it to be ' extra hot '			2
now @entity18 - starred chef @entity17 is hoping to tempt @entity20 foodies with a range of traditional @entity14 dishes , from roast chicken and bread and butter pudding to rhubarb tart			1
and he promises they will be far from bland			0
spoof : hit @entity29 comedy show @entity30 say a group of @entity7 friends order their food ' extra , extra bland '			0
now a @entity14 chef is taking @entity14 food to @entity36 - but it wo n't be bland @entity18 - starred chef @entity17 is hoping tempt @entity20 foodies with a range of traditional @entity14 dishes , from roast chicken , bread and butter pudding and rhubarb tart mr @entity17 , 40 , is part of a team of @entity14 chefs heading to @entity36 next month to showcase the best of @entity14 cuisine at a 10 - day festival of food called the @entity50 in the southern city of @entity52			1
while the rest of the cooks are offering mild @entity14 curries to the audience , mr @entity17 will be serving up exclusively @entity14 favourites			1
mr @entity17 , who until last month ran the one - @entity18 star @entity59 in @entity60 , has created a menu filled with @entity14 classics like @entity64 hotpot along with desserts including banana @entity67 mess for @entity20 diners at the @entity70			1
traditional menu : mr @entity17 will be presenting @entity64 hotpot ( left ) and roast chicken ( right ) at the taste of @entity75 contrast : while most of the @entity14 contingent will still be cooking curries ( right ) , mr @entity17 's menu includes deserts like @entity67 mess ( left ) the taste of @entity14 curry festival has been backed by prime minister @entity84			1
he said : ' i 'm delighted to see that more than 200 years after the first curry house opened in @entity14 our unique brand of @entity7 cuisine is now being sought in the countries where it originally came from			2
' in recent years curry has become part of the @entity14 identity - a firm favourite that is enjoyed by more than two million people every week			2
but it 's so much more than just good food			0
' it 's about talented restaurateurs and chefs ; it 's about hard - working families ; it 's about enterprising small businesses that provide tens of thousands of jobs and it 's about bringing in billions of pounds into our economy			2
' classic : mr @entity17 will also try his luck with a tradition shepherd 's pie on his traditional @entity14 project , mr @entity17 , who is not a curry chef by training , told @entity116 that there was great potential for @entity36 to get stuck in to classic pub grub			1
he said : ' in @entity36 the @entity14 classics would go down very , very well - and this is the angle we 're looking at			1
' at the moment there other cuisines - like @entity127 restaurants and pizza , alongside the traditional @entity20 food with the @entity131 ovens and kebabs			1
' in @entity134 you 've got lots of different style of restaurant - why ca n't you do that in @entity36 ? the country 's growing - there 's absolutely no reason why a pub serving fish and chips , shepherd 's pie or a sunday roast with a pint of beer could n't all work			1
there 's a taste for it that has n't been tapped yet , and we want to spread the word about our @entity14 cuisine			2
' @entity52 is a city famous for its biryani rice - based dishes and a style of cooking from the @entity161 which ruled @entity36 in the 16th and 17th centuries			1
@entity163 , director of the taste of @entity75 which is taking place early june , said : ' we know @entity36 have a sweet tooth , we will take over some puddings like bread and butter pudding , rhubarb tart , and lemon tart			1
' @entity17 is running with a traditional @entity8 menu like sunday roast with chicken , casserole dishes			1
' @entity176 is n't the only @entity20 food that has made its way onto @entity14 tables			1
@entity180 is a traditional @entity14 breakfast dish made from curried rice , smoked fish , boiled eggs , parsley and lemon juice			1
it may be considered a traditional @entity14 breakfast dish , but its roots are well bedded in @entity20 cooking having started its life as khichari , a humble dish of rice and lentils			1
thanks to the @entity196 and the colonisation of the sub-continent the dish was taken , adapted and turned into something more familiar to those serving in @entity36 , and it returned to these shores with them			2
similarly , mulligatawny soup is also an @entity20 invention			0
the name is from the @entity208 language of south east @entity36 , @entity209 and @entity210 , meaning ' pepper water '			0
created by servants for the @entity213 who demanded a soup course from a cuisine that had never produced one			0
@entity217 , meanwhile , is slightly different			0
it is an @entity8 interpretation of @entity20 pickles , a relish of chopped pickled vegetables and spices ; regional recipes vary considerably			0
the word is believed to date from the middle of the 18th century when it appeared in a book for housekeepers			0
the origins of @entity14 's favourite curry , the @entity230 , are hotly debated			2
chefs in @entity232 have claimed it was invented there in the early 1970s			0
but @entity235 's leading food historians have dismissed as ' preposterous ' , arguing the dish was a recipe devised in the @entity161 period			0
another @entity14 interpretation of @entity20 food is the famous balti , invented in @entity242 in the 1970s when a chef moved from making meals for family and friends in the immigrant community to opening a restaurant			1
mr @entity163 , 52 , from @entity249 , said @entity14 curries are popular because they are different to @entity20 cuisine			2
he said : ' some people will say it 's like selling coal to @entity255 or ice to the @entity257 , but i do n't see it like this			0
' they see our ingredients are better and of premium quality			0
and the dishes are milder and healthier , i do n't want to criticise but sometimes in @entity36 it becomes too spicy and overpowering			2
' with the @entity14 palate , some people eat hot curries but generally it 's milder and it has less ghee and butter			2
' when we first went to @entity36 in 2006 we thought it was a challenge as curry originates in @entity36 but they are food - loving people and like to experiment			1
' as well as mr @entity17 and mr @entity163 six other chefs from @entity14 will be travelling to the southern city of @entity52			1
among the other chefs are @entity278 , from @entity279 , @entity280 , from @entity281 , @entity282 , from @entity283 , @entity284 , from @entity285 , @entity286 , from @entity287 , and @entity288 , from @entity289 in @entity290			0
one @entity14 restaurant boss who has been offered the chance to open a curry house in @entity36 is @entity294 , chair of the @entity295			1
he was offered a proposal to open a branch of his @entity299 restaurant in @entity300 , @entity301 , in @entity302 in northern @entity36			0
mr @entity294 believes @entity14 curries will be a long - term success in @entity36			1
' the name @entity14 curry is trendy and the flavours are different than in @entity36 as @entity14 curries are not extremely hot			1
the cooking process is different as in @entity36 they cook with a big pot like a @entity161 dinner			0
' in @entity249 , they have followed a bit of @entity315 and @entity8 style of cooking one dish individually			0
@entity317 said to me during the @entity319 our lamb curry was better than in @entity36			0
' but curry expert @entity322 , author of the @entity323 , is more sceptical			0
he said : ' the reaction of all of my @entity20 friends to the @entity176 is one of disdain			0
' maybe it 's an over-reaction ; one or two formulaic @entity331 curry houses produce excellent food			0
but i have my doubts that @entity14 cuisine will take off in @entity36			2

chef @entity17 is attending a food festival in @entity52 , @entity36
he 's hoping tempt @entity20 foodies with a range of traditional @entity14 dishes
on his menu are @entity14 classics like roast chicken and rhubarb tart
a team of other @entity14 chefs are also flying out - but they 're serving curry
