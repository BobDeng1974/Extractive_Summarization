by @entity0 for @entity1 coming out can be incredibly hard for gay people to do - the fear of how family and friends will react often delays announcement for years , or even decades			1
but for @entity8 , the decision to tell the world she was a lesbian was n't just about telling her nearest and dearest , it was was also going to risk shattering her income and having her deported from the country she lived in			1
for over a decade , the 35 - year - old 's music has been played across @entity19 's bible belt as a soundtrack to modern @entity21			1
from the age of fourteen , the @entity22 had been travelling to perform the religious music she wrote at concerts and churches from her family home in @entity28			2
@entity8 has written and performed her own @entity21 music from a very young age , she eventually became one of the biggest religious music stars in the @entity19 after undertaking a theology degree at @entity36 , the success of @entity8 's songs took her to across the pond to @entity38 , where she got a record contract and proceeded to become a big name in religious music			1
but despite her career success , the @entity42 never had a chance to enjoy how well she was doing , because she was constantly hiding a huge secret - the fact that she is attracted to women			2
she said : ' my income comes from churches - they have to pay a fee to use my music , so that paid my rent and put food on the table			2
@entity8 traveled across both the @entity56 and @entity19 playing her tracks in churches , concerts and rallies ' even when i first spoke out in support of same - sex marriage , i was boycotted by certain churches			1
' they told me that because i supported equal marriage , my songs were now polluted			1
' i knew that saying anything about my sexuality to anyone would make my world crumble			2
' while i was living in @entity19 , even my immigration visa was tied into me doing the specific job of performing in churches , so i could have been deported from the country if people had chosen to stop booking me			1
' being torn between the church and her sexuality was nothing new to @entity8			1
from a young age , she realised that the way she felt about her own sex was n't acceptable in @entity21			2
aged just 13 , she approached a catholic priest to confess how she felt and he prayed for her to be forgiven			2
sadly , this only made her feel worse , to the extent that she broke down in her bedroom that year and sobbed over how helpless she was to change a key part of herself that her faith believed was bad			1
three years later , she attended a @entity21 youth camp in the @entity90 countryside and made the only other attempt at reaching out that she would do before turning 30			2
at the camp , she decided to take part in an exorcism that would cleanse her of being attracted to women			1
as she stood on stage in front of thousands of people , @entity21 leaders shouted and screamed in tongues and called for the demons to come out of her , for the devils to leave her body			0
the experience traumatised @entity8 enough to stop her mentioning anything about being gay for another 14 years			1
she said : " the hardest part was that they made me feel like there was something evil in me taking me over , that i was being taken over by demonic powers			0
' these were really important @entity21 leaders in the community carrying out this exorcism and saying these things to me			2
' later that night , a girl got up who must 've been about 18 - two years older than me - and spoke about how she had been set free and cured of being gay			2
' that made me convinced that it would work for me , but two weeks later i still felt the same way			0
' the thing is , you ca n't feel bad towards the people who did it , because the really had the best intention in the world by wanting to set me free			0
' so @entity8 hid how she felt for years , while travelling @entity19 's bible belt to perform at churches and rallys - places where anti-gay sentiment was rife			1
she said : ' a lot of churches that i would play at in @entity19 would say that homosexuality was something that the devil had designed to end the world by stopping people from procreating			1
' there would be big billboards on the roads saying things like ' @entity146 '			0
since deciding to come out at the age of 35 , @entity8 feels like she is looking at life in a completely different way			1
she said : " i feel like i have been given a second chance at life			0
" ' if i was still living in @entity19 , i could never have had the courage to do this , i would have had a genuine fear for my safety			1
' the turning point came when she was diagnosed with an auto - immune disease called linear scleroderma morphea , aged 30 , where the soft tissue in the body turns to scarring			0
the disease can often be linked to a point of stress - in @entity8 's case she assumed it was her hidden sexuality			1
while undergoing severe hospital treatments including chemotherapy , she decided to set herself an age when she would tell people she was a lesbian - that age would be 35			2
she said : ' so that 's why i have decided to come out now , because i made a decision when i was very ill about coming out when i turned 35			2
' and it just so happens that almost a month ago today , the @entity175 voted in favour women bishops			0
@entity8 is now setting out a second career path as a religious commentator and hopes coming out will help the @entity175 to get behind same - sex marriages ' the next hurdle is the issue of same sex marriage - i 'm hoping seeing people like me will help that			1
' i think it will be a slow change , but it will happen faster than women bishops took			0
it will happen by listening to @entity189 , by putting faces to something instead of just looking at theology			0
' i told my parents at @entity194 , so they have n't have very long to get used to everything , but hey were great though , they said that they do n't have to choose between agreeing and loving me			0
' it is less than 24 hours since she came out to the general public , but @entity8 said she has been stunned by the response from people			1
she said : ' i 've had people of very different faiths write to me overnight to say they do n't necessarily agree with me , but they still love me			0
' that 's a wonderful things to be told			0
after being given the all - clear from her illness , @entity8 is now looking forward to the next stage of her life			1
she said : " doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day i can get married , because until now i did n't think that was possible			0
" ' obviously i have had some messages from the very conservative @entity189 which are n't so nice , but i am choosing not to read them for the time being			0
i need to be strong right now and the lovely messages i am getting are giving me so much strength			0
' one of the best messages was from @entity220 and her father @entity221 , the archbishop of @entity223 , who @entity8 knows very well			1
she said : ' @entity220 told me told me that the whole family have said that i am just as welcome at their dinner table and they still love me			0
i 'm actually going round there for dinner next week			0
' ' the exciting thing about doing all of this is that it gives me the hope that some day i can get married , because until now i did n't think that was possible			0
' and i 'm fully in remission now from my illness and have been given the all - clear			0
' i feel like i have been given a second chance at life			0

@entity8 , 35 , is one of most successful singers in @entity19 *christian* rock
the @entity56 star tried to ' cure ' herself of being gay as a child via exorcism
finally came out this year and has been astonished by support received
she is hoping to use her story to help the church to accept gay marriage
