in 2002 , then - @entity1 striker @entity0 finished the @entity3 season with 23 goals to his name			1
only @entity6 ( 24 ) scored more than the @entity7 who , at the age 30 , had confirmed his status as one of @entity12 's top marksmen			0
it was the second season in a row he had scored 23 in the top flight and the sixth consecutive season in which @entity0 had notched more than 15 goals in one of @entity12 's top divisions			2
1st * @entity26 ( @entity25 ) , november 22			0
2nd * @entity27 ( a ) , november 29 , 3rd * @entity28 ( a ) , december 6			0
11th * @entity29 ( @entity25 ) , december 13			0
24th * @entity30 ( a ) , december 19			0
7th * * @entity3 position the year 2002 was also a significant one for @entity22			2
under the guidance of player - manager @entity33 the @entity22 were promoted to the conference for the first time in their relatively short history after winning the @entity37			1
it is truly remarkable , then , that @entity0 is in the @entity40 hotseat just 12 years later			1
but rather than it being a fall from grace for the 42 - year - old - whose only previous managerial experience was last season at @entity47 second tier side @entity48 - it is instead a testament to the rise in stature of a club well - run by long - serving chairman @entity52 and his board			0
that being said , @entity0 will no doubt find the confines of the @entity56 and @entity57 somewhat different to playing at @entity58 and at the @entity59			1
here 's what @entity0 can expect to find at @entity22 ... @entity22 play their home games at the 6,912 - seater @entity56 ( above ) facilities the thought of @entity57 training grounds conjures images of @entity30 's converted gym or @entity69 's borrowed recreation park , not of state of the art facilities costing Â£ 120million			1
well , that 's exactly what @entity0 and his players have to work with at the @entity74 at @entity75			0
situated in @entity40 , the @entity76 allowed @entity22 to train at @entity75 's throughout its construction and they have continued to do so since its official opening in october 2012			1
@entity40 have planning permission in place to build training facilities on the site of their @entity56 but have not needed to do so after being given permission to remain at @entity75 's for the ' foreseeable future '			0
@entity12 president @entity86 ( second right ) visits @entity75 - where @entity40 train - last week @entity88 players ( left to right ) @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity92 train at @entity75 's @entity0 - who coached at @entity93 from july 2011 to january 2013 - admitted to being ' delighted ' with the facilities			1
' they are the best in the country , ' he said on thursday			0
his predecessor @entity97 admitted to @entity98 in september 2012 : ' i 've sold the club to some of the new signings by showing them that we 're training at one of the best training grounds in the world - not many @entity57 clubs can say that ! ' the @entity109 , while lacking the grandeur of @entity75 's , is a smart , new stadium ( built in 2005 ) with potential to expand its 6,912 capacity			1
squad @entity0 's predecessor @entity97 , who left to take the @entity116 job last month , has built a squad more than capable of mounting an automatic promotion challenge			1
in his two - and - a - half years at the club , @entity97 steadily improved the quality of the playing staff , mainly bringing in free transfers and loans to achieve successive play - off finishes			1
@entity40 lost to @entity125 in the @entity57 final at @entity127 in may and at the semi-final stage the year before			1
@entity97 - who left @entity40 last month - celebrates his first win as @entity116 manager under @entity33 , in charge from 1998 to 2009 , and @entity132 , who oversaw their first @entity134 season in 2009 - 10 before being sacked in march 2012 , @entity40 were reliant on journeymen brought in using the contacts of those two ex-players			1
@entity0 though will find plenty of youth and energy in his squad			0
wingers @entity142 , 24 , and @entity143 , 25 , are both vital to the way @entity40 were playing under @entity97 , while academy product @entity145 is a promising midfielder			1
there is experience in the backline with the presence of @entity151 and @entity152 - a @entity154 academy product during their halcyon days under @entity156 which @entity0 was a part of - while captain @entity159 is an assured performer in midfield			2
@entity0 watches from the touchline as his @entity48 side face @entity163 in september 2013 but the man who will surely be most excited about working with @entity0 is striker @entity165			0
the 30 - year - old @entity167 man took the step down from @entity169 to join on a free from @entity170 in the summer but has scored just three times this season			0
@entity165 has the pedigree to fire @entity40 to promotion if he can strike an understanding with @entity142 , @entity143 and former @entity176 youngster @entity175 in the attacking third			0
form @entity40 , as they have been for the last two seasons , are cemented in the @entity57 play - off positions			1
@entity0 's new side sit fifth in the table but are just three points off leaders @entity24 and have a five - point cushion to the chasing pack			2
their form over the last two months has been poor though			0
the @entity22 picked up 19 points from a possible 21 in their opening seven games but the next nine games have yielded just 10 more , with only three wins in that time			0
@entity40 's players trudge off the pitch after they were beaten 5 - 0 by @entity197 on saturday when @entity97 , heralded as one of the brightest young @entity200 managers in the @entity134 , left @entity40 , they were already in a downward spiral			1
@entity40 's inconsistent performances continued under caretaker @entity203 and they were thumped 5 - 0 in the @entity205 first round by @entity197 on saturday			2
they have in fact lost nine of their last 13 games in all competitions			2
everything is in place for @entity0 and his assistant @entity214 to guide @entity22 to @entity169 , but first they must deal with the club 's recent slump			2
his start could n't be tougher			0
@entity40 travel to table - topping @entity24 on monday night before facing second - placed @entity26 and third - placed @entity27 .			2

@entity0 appointed @entity22 manager
@entity0 succeeds @entity97 who left for @entity116
@entity40 are fifth in @entity57 having lost play - off final in may
the @entity22 have won just three in their last 13 in all competitions
