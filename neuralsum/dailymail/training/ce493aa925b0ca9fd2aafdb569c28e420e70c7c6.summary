by @entity0 mystery : @entity2 was believed to be 75 when he vanished in 1926 near @entity3 , @entity4 experts could soon solve the mystery of a 75 - year - old man who vanished on a trip to see his daughter in 1926 - making him @entity11 's second - oldest missing person case			1
@entity13 's fate was unknown until loggers stumbled upon a skeleton with a single shot to the skull next to a rusty revolver in the woods , 60 years after his death			1
experts now believe the skeleton belonged to mr @entity2 , who vanished near @entity3 , @entity4 , and have found three direct descendants with a dna match			1
but because the remains were so disintegrated , they need one final piece in the puzzle - another relative of mr @entity2 's mother			1
incredibly mr @entity2 is still listed as an active case on the @entity31			2
that makes his entry - describing him as more than 150 years old , 5ft 8in and walking with a cane - the second - oldest in the country			0
the only older case is that of @entity37 , an @entity38 farmer who set off to a meeting on horseback in 1902 but never arrived			0
unlike the case of mr @entity37 , however , mr @entity2 's disappearance was well - documented at the time			1
he left the home he shared with his wife to visit his daughter @entity45 , 10 miles away , but did not arrive			0
his panicked daughter offered a $ 100 reward ( $ 1,400 in today 's money ) and ran an appeal in the local newspaper , where he was described as well - known and well - liked			0
the newspaper said he had been traced to a terminal in downtown @entity3 and police across the @entity54 were put on the lookout for him			2
but despite a wealth of information on mr @entity2 , who had partial paralysis on the right side , a ' halting gait ' and could n't use his right arm , no trace of him was found			2
cold case : a photograph of @entity2 and an unidentified woman , possibly his wife			2
his is the second - oldest missing person case in the @entity11 , beaten only by an @entity38 farmer who vanished on horseback in 1902 appeal : a $ 100 reward was offered for information on mr @entity2 's whereabouts			1
it is believed he may have taken his own life			0
pictured are stories that ran in @entity76 on november 3 , 1926 ( left ) and november 11 , 1926 that was until may 10 , 1986			0
loggers were clearing an isolated section of @entity3 when they discovered the remains of a mystery man who had been dead for at least half a century			2
near the skeleton , investigators found an 1888 nickel , a 1919 penny , a pocket watch , leather shoes , wire - rimmed glasses , a @entity90 pocket knife and four tokens with the inscription @entity93			1
a historian told @entity76 in 1986 that those where likely tavern tokens , which were awarded in card games and could be used to buy food or alcohol			0
police also found a corroded revolver , and an expended .32 - caliber bullet			1
a single shot had entered the skull at the temple			1
medical examiners , who said it was the oldest case they ever had , ruled the unknown man 's death a suicide and most people assumed the man 's identity would not be found			2
do you recognise this ? a photo which it is believed shows the home of @entity2 in @entity118 , @entity4 but a few days later , a woman called @entity120 came forward and said it might be her grandfather , mr @entity2			1
she said he had once been the town marshal for @entity123 , a small area near the secluded ravine where the body was found			2
her hunch , however , was not enough to solve the disappearance and she died in 1991			0
the case receded again for two decades until dr @entity129 , from the @entity4 state medical examiner 's office , found the file on the suicide and began investigating			2
using technology not available before , experts re-examined the remains and created a more detailed dna profile			0
with the help of volunteers , it was matched to three of mr @entity2 's great - great - grandchildren , all from the paternal line			1
the match was a weak one , however , partly because of the age and disintegration of the remains			0
that means another descendant of his mother is needed to fully confirm the skeleton 's identity			0
the mystery deepens : claims that remains found in the woods near @entity3 could have been those of mr @entity2 were revealed in local newspaper @entity76 on may 26 , 1986			1
the skull was found with a bullet hole ms @entity129 said : ' there 's an association there , but it 's not strong at this point			2
' they 're looking for a maternal link , someone on his mother 's side , and following that lineage to shore it up and make the statistics a little better			0
' there might have been an item of jewelry that was found with that person that could trigger a memory of a family member			0
' ' we 've got somebody that we 're looking at right now , so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually @entity2 's ' - @entity181 , @entity31 @entity181 , a retired homicide detective who works for the missing persons database , revealed one maternal relative has already come forward as a result of this week 's media coverage			1
' we 've got somebody that we 're looking at right now , ' she told @entity187			0
' so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually @entity2 's			1
' the missing people database is funded by the @entity190 and consists of nearly 10,000 cases			0
among the other oldest cases are two - year - old @entity193 , who disappeared in 1930 in @entity194 , and 22 - year - old hiker @entity195 , who vanished in the @entity196 in 1933			0
there is one major stumbling block in the case of mr @entity2 , however			0
reports on the skeleton from 1986 put the age of the deceased at between 35 and 55 - even though mr @entity2 was 75 when he died			1
that means even if more relatives are found , mr @entity2 's fate could remain a mystery for many more years to come .			1

@entity13 was 75 when he disappeared on a trip to @entity3 , @entity4
then in 1986 , loggers found a skeleton in the woods with a 1919 penny
there was a corroded revolver beside the body and single shot to the skull
since then dna *analysts* have been trying to find @entity2 's descendants
they found three direct relatives , but need someone from maternal line
@entity187 can reveal a maternal relative has come forward in last few days
