@entity0 was just 27 when her mother first noticed she was becoming forgetful and kept losing things			1
by the time she was 29 , the mother - of - two had been diagnosed with dementia and was unable to look after her young daughters			1
she has now been in the final stages of the disease for five years and spends her days lying in the foetal position in a specially adapted chair			2
@entity0 ( pictured before she developed dementia ) started to become forgetful and to lose things when she was 27 and had just had her second baby			1
she was diagnosed with dementia when she was just 29 at just 42 , she is unable to move her limbs , can only consume liquids , is unaware of what is going on around her and has not spoken for four years			1
she is also profoundly deaf			2
her mother , @entity19 , 63 , told @entity20 : ‘ when she was diagnosed i felt utter devastation			2
‘ it is very difficult to understand – when someone gets ill and you know it is terminal usually it does not usually go on so long			0
you have the right to grieve			0
‘ i grieve for the person she was but we still have a person who is n’t my @entity0			0
‘ her life is just one long nightmare			0
’ ms @entity0 , who now lives in a care home in @entity37 , has two children - @entity39 , 20 , and @entity40 , 16			1
ms @entity0 is now 42 and can not move her limbs , is profoundly deaf , exists on a liquid diet and has not spoken for four years she started to develop symptoms of dementia when @entity40 was a baby			1
her mother says the first signs were that she was forgetful , kept losing things , was putting things in the wrong place as was ‘ not really with it ’			1
however , as her daughter was only 27 , dementia was the last thing on her mind			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ you associate dementia with older people			2
it was n’t something that crossed my mind			0
‘ she had just had her second child so i thought she was just struggling to get into a routine			1
‘ i thought she might have had postnatal depression – you try to come up with answers as you just do n’t know			1
’ in 1999 , ms @entity0 had an argument with her partner and tried to throw a ladder at him			0
as a result , she was committed and spent time in hospital while doctors tried to establish what was wrong with her			0
she was eventually released but her family soon realised she could not cope			2
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ the three generations of daughters were all supposed to be going on holiday together , but @entity0 decided she did not want to go , so she stayed with my mum , @entity79			0
‘ me and the two kids went away , but @entity0 forgot where they were			0
‘ she kept wandering off saying she was looking for them and could n’t find them			0
’ as a result , she was taken to the @entity85 in @entity86 , a specialist neurological hospital			0
there , doctors carried out numerous tests and eventually diagnosed her with dementia			1
mrs @entity19 said : ‘ we were just told that ’s how it is - no one could really answer my questions			2
ms @entity0 's mother , @entity19 ( right ) , says at first she thought her daughter had postnatal depression because she had just had her second baby , @entity40 ( left )			1
@entity40 is now 16 and has never known her mother without dementia ‘ i have felt all the emotions sadness , anger , frustration but most of all i feel sad , it ’s a living nightmare , i visit what looks like my daughter but it ’s not her , not the person she was			1
’ as a result , ms @entity0 ’s young daughters went to live with their great grandmother , @entity79 , who was already in her 70s , and ms @entity0 was moved to a rehabilitation home in @entity113			2
she spent 18 months at the home before the @entity115 helped her family to find her a place in an early - onset dementia unit in @entity37			1
she has been there since may 2005			0
ms @entity0 ’s daughter , @entity40 , who now lives with her older sister , @entity39 , said : ‘ as i was only around two years old at the time it ’s just something i have simply grown up with , for as long as i can remember my mum has had dementia , i do n’t really know anything different			1
people diagnosed with dementia before they are 65 are said to have early - onset dementia			1
there are more than 17,000 people in the @entity132 who are known to have early - onset dementia , but there are thought be a lot more who have not yet been diagnosed			1
young people with dementia often struggle to get a diagnosis because of a lack of awareness of the condition in young people			2
they are often misdiagnosed as having depression or as being stressed			0
symptoms include memory problems , poor judgement , mood changes , disorientation and speech and language problems			0
source : @entity115 ‘ it is still difficult at times but as i have no recollection of living with my mum i just get on with life			0
’ she added : ‘ she is in the late stages now , she sleeps a lot of the time and can not really move the lower half of her body			0
she does n’t know who i am but i still go and see her			0
’ director of research and development at the @entity115 dr @entity164 said : ‘ it is estimated around 17,000 people in the @entity132 are living with dementia under the age of 65 , but to be diagnosed at such a young age is incredibly rare			1
‘ if you are worried about any problems with memory or thinking , at any age , you should always go to your gp			0
’ last month , @entity40 and a friend took part in a 10km @entity176 in @entity177 to raise money for the @entity115			1
she is hoping to raise money - to help pay for research - and awareness about the condition			0
she said : ‘ raising awareness is so important , people are always surprised to find out my mum has dementia as she is so young , i want to show people that it can happen to anyone , it ’s not just something that affects older people			0
’ to donate , visit www.justgiving.com/louises-memory-walk10 @entity40 , who has just done a fundraising walk for the @entity115 , said : ' it is still difficult at times but as i have no recollection of living with my mum i just get on with life '			2
