by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:39 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 04:46 est , 5 december 2012 @entity4 plans to follow up its @entity6 mission with a duplicate rover that could collect and store samples for return to @entity10 , the agency 's lead scientist said			1
the new rover will use spare parts and engineering models developed for @entity6 , which is four months into a planned $ 2.5billion mission on @entity15 to look for habitats that could have supported microbial life			1
replicating the rover 's chassis , sky - crane landing system and other gear will enable @entity4 to cut the cost of the new mission to about $ 1.5billion including launch costs , @entity18 , the @entity20 space agency 's associate administrator for science , said at the @entity30 conference in @entity31			1
@entity44 instead will partner with @entity49 for the launch vehicle and other equipment that was to have been provided by @entity4			1
mr @entity18 said @entity4 will provide a key organics experiment for @entity44 's @entity54 rover , as well as engineering and mission support under the agency 's proposed budget for the year beginning october 1 , 2013			1
the @entity20 also will provide the radio communications equipment for a planned @entity44 orbiter slated to launch in 2016			2
details about what science instruments would be included on the new rover , whether or not it would have a cache for samples , and the landing site have not yet been determined			2
@entity4 plans to set up a team of scientists to refine plans for the rover and issue a solicitation next summer			1
space travel ... on a budget : replicating the rover 's chassis , sky - crane landing system and other gear will enable @entity4 to cut the cost of the new mission to about $ 1.5billion including launch costs sample collection : details about what science instruments would be included on the new rover , whether or not it would have a cache for samples , and the landing site have not yet been determined the @entity15 rover curiosity has completed its first chemical test of soil from the red planet , and scientists say there are no surprises so far			1
the spacecraft is on a mission to look for ingredients in @entity15 soil and rocks that could support life			0
but in the first scoop of soil analysed , there were no definitive signs of the chemical building blocks of life			0
' we have no definitive detection of @entity15 organics at this point , but we will keep looking in the diverse environments of @entity111 , ' said sam principal investigator @entity112 of @entity4 's @entity113			2
instead , the six - wheel rover detected water and a mix of other chemicals			0
a comment by mission 's chief scientist two weeks ago led to speculation that @entity6 had dug up carbon - based organics , considered an essential ingredient for life			2
the @entity125 last year ranked a @entity15 sample return mission as its top priority in planetary science for the next decade			0
' the ( science ) community already has come forward with a very clear message about what the content of the next @entity15 surface mission should be , and that is to cache the samples that will come back to @entity10 , ' said @entity137 with @entity138			0
' that 's really a necessary part of having this mission , ' he said			0
@entity4 had considered flying an orbiter in 2018 , but decided instead to provide equipment for the @entity44 probes , extend its ongoing @entity15 missions and develop the @entity6 twin rover for launch in 2020			1
' we could have come up with something in 2018 , but with the budget that we 're in we would not have had such a full program			0
' it would have been a down - scaled orbiter of some kind , ' mr @entity18 said			0
a photo taken by @entity6 from the surface of @entity15 : the new rover also would help @entity4 prepare for eventual human missions to @entity15 , a long - term objective of the @entity20 space program under the revamped @entity15 plan , @entity6 's two - year mission would be extended to five years			1
the new rover also would help @entity4 prepare for eventual human missions to @entity15 , a long - term objective of the @entity20 space program			2
' if we think of the 2030s as the potential for human exploration , i think this 2020 rover and the other things we might be able to do in the 2020s as a synergistic collaboration between science and human spaceflight			0
' there are a lot of cool things we can do , ' mr @entity18 said .			0

duplicate rover to be made from spare parts and engineering model left over from @entity6
could pave the way for a manned mission in 2030
facing budget cuts , @entity4 hopes to cut the cost of the entire mission to just $ 1.5bn including launch costs
