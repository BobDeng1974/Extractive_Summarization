is this the best bathtub in @entity1 ? soaking in both the bubbles and the views through floor to ceiling glass from 118metres above ground level , there 's really no need to ever leave the tub , if you do n't mind a little pruning skin			1
i may not have been a guest in the @entity14 during my stay at the @entity16 , but i did climb into the en suite bathtub fully clothed during a clandestine sneak peek , just to see how the other half bathe , and yes , i feel i would be right at home here			2
soak in the views : the @entity14 en suite bathtub has panoramic views of the city from its floor - to - ceiling windows wake up in the sky : the palatial 260 - square metre suite enjoys panoramic views from all walls with two palatial bathrooms off of two enormous bedrooms adjoined by a chic lounge and dining room complete with grand piano and floor - to - ceiling windows with spectacular views throughout , it is little surprise that the suite enjoys an impressive occupancy rate - despite a nightly charge of Â£ 4,160			1
down in the elevator a few floors is where my @entity44 is located			0
the suites manage to be contemporary and practical , sleek and elegant , and plush with designer touches to please every guest from business travellers to discerning holiday makers			0
features include a full size lounge with adjoining kitchenette , marble bathroom with a walk - in shower room and tvs hidden in the mirrors , and a pillow menu that includes non-allergenic , feather , wedge shape , cherry stone and horse hair ... but what really wowed me about the suite was the views			1
