for a man with so much going on in his head , @entity0 has done a fair job of relocating his feet			1
it ’s barely been three weeks since the @entity6 with 25 goals to his name last season was facing questions of his failure to score even one in this campaign			1
@entity14 has had a hand in eight goals ( seven assists , one goal ) in nine @entity20 games for @entity21 this season			1
those have been sufficiently addressed , with four strikes in three games , including the two on saturday that saw off @entity27 and made his position in forthcoming contract talks a touch stronger			2
those discussions are expected to commence imminently , with @entity0 ( right ) happy to extend his commitment beyond the summer of 2017 , though he has made no secret of his ambitions to join a bigger club			1
@entity0 has been in fine form for @entity21 after scoring four goals in three games @entity0 and @entity14 combined for both goals which saw @entity21 beat @entity27 2 - 0 the @entity6 scored 25 goals for @entity21 last campaign and has answered his critics in the last three weeks @entity21 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity44 6 ; @entity45 7 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 7 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6 , @entity50 6.5 ; @entity51 6 ( @entity52 83min ) , @entity14 7.5 ( @entity53 58 , 6 ) , @entity54 7 ; @entity0 8 ( @entity55 83 )			1

man of the match : @entity0			1
approaches never came in the summer despite interest from @entity87 and @entity88 , but that will surely change if the 25 - year - old matches last season ’s goal tally , which is his target			1
‘ i knew the goals would come , ’ said @entity0 , who celebrated his strikes against @entity27 with a t - shirt tribute to two friends who died recently			1
‘ when i was n’t scoring the team was doing well			0
now , the team needs me to score and i did			0
i have a target in my head and i will take it step by step			0
’ of his contract situation , @entity0 added : ‘ contract talks i leave to my agent			2
’ @entity107 , meanwhile , does not expect to be charged by the @entity108 after he said @entity110 ’s @entity109 cheated			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve been in contact with the @entity108			0
i ’ve made my views , i ’m happy with them and i ca n’t see anything happening after that			0
’ @entity27 boss @entity116 has seen his side go four games without a win since the 5 - 3 victory over @entity121			2
he said : ‘ the problem is people want to talk about that ( the @entity121 game ) all the time			0
but as soon as that game is over it is not important			0
