by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 14 february 2013 @entity2 's patent authority has taken a bite out of @entity4 after ruling that the @entity6 name belongs to a local company , not to the global computer giant			1
the verdict wo n't forbid @entity4 from using the name in @entity2 , but it makes it clear the rights belong to local consumer electronics firm @entity14			1
the @entity17 - based company 's request to use the iphone trademark was granted in 2008 , and the company started making ' iphones ' - with a lowercase ' p ' - in december			1
the new iphone ... which runs on @entity24 : @entity2 company @entity14 have tried to cash in on the @entity4 gadget 's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone the company was the first to make cellphones in @entity2 , and launched the first national smartphone in 2004			1
their phones are entirely different from @entity4 's flagship mobile device			1
for starters , the @entity14 iphone runs on the @entity24 operating system , developed by @entity4 rival @entity37 and it does n't come anywhere the specs of @entity4 's flagship gadget , nor does it look much like it 's namesake			1
dubbed the @entity14 iphone @entity44 , using a @entity43 processor it splashes @entity46 onto a 3.7in capacitive touchscreen display			1
the dual - sim phone comes complete with two cameras , front and back , with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution respectively , but no flash - although if you live in sun - soaked @entity2 you might not need it			0
it also has lower screen resolution , weighs more than the @entity4 phone , and sells for a fraction of the price at 599 @entity61 - about £ 180			2
@entity62 to head : name aside , there are few similarities between the iphone and @entity4 's genuine article , right one in every two smartphones sold worldwide is made by either @entity4 or @entity69 , research has revealed			1
in the fourth quarter of 2012 , the mobile device arch - rivals accounted for 52 percent of smartphone sales , up from 46 percent in the third quarter , according to tech market research firm @entity74			2
sales of mobile phones around the world fell last year for the first time since 2009 as consumers shunned cheaper feature phones , the company said yesterday			0
' tough economic conditions , shifting consumer preferences , and intense market competition weakened the worldwide mobile phone market , ' said @entity74 analyst @entity86			0
but smartphone sales continued to rise , he said			0
higher - end devices would account for more than half the market for the first time this year			0
total worldwide mobile sales to end users fell 1.7 percent to 1.75 billion units in 2012			0
@entity69 and @entity4 continued to dominate the market , with the @entity96 company selling 385million phones in 2012 , of which 53.5 per cent were smartphones , with @entity4 selling 130million smartphones			2
@entity101 company @entity100 reached third spot in worldwide smartphone sales for the first time in the fourth quarter , @entity74 said			0
it sold 27.2million smartphones in 2012 , up 74 per cent			0
@entity14 filed its request to use the @entity6 brand in 2000 , believing that ' there would be a technological revolution in the world of cellphones , with the convergence of transmission and reception of voice and data via mobile internet , ' it said in a press release			1
the verdict wo n't forbid @entity4 from using the name in @entity2 , but it makes it clear the rights belong @entity14 , said @entity123 , a spokesman for the country 's national patent office			1
stopping @entity4 's use of the name is beyond the patent office 's remit , and would have to be decided in court			1
another option is for the two companies to reach an agreement , he added			0
the issue in @entity2 is reminiscent of one that arose in the @entity137 in 2007			0
@entity138 had owned the @entity6 trademark since 2000 , and had been using it for a line of @entity142 - connected phones			2
once @entity4 announced its intention to use the brand name , @entity138 sued it in @entity146 federal court			2
the two companies settled out of court six weeks later , without disclosing the terms			0
the latest dispute is likely to be resolved the same way , with @entity4 probably choosing to pay the @entity2 company for the right to use the @entity6 brand in @entity156 's largest country , a telecommunications analyst told the @entity157 in december			2
this seems the best option for @entity4 , because it ' does n't want to stop selling its product in @entity2 , ' said @entity161 , president of @entity2 telecommunications consultancy @entity162 .			0

patent office rules @entity17 - based firm has rights to the now - *iconic* name
