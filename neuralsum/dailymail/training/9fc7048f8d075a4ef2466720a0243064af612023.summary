by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 19:58 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 05:11 est , 5 march 2014 savers will be crippled by ‘ several more years ’ of rock - bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years , experts warned last night			1
it was exactly five years ago today that the @entity8 made the emergency move to halve the base rate to 0.5 per cent			1
prudent savers have been robbed of more than £ 300 billion by the @entity8 ’s decision due to dire interest rates as well as their nest egg ’s loss of spending power as the cost of living has risen			1
savers will be crippled by ' several more years ' of rock - bottom interest rates in a form of financial torture that has already lasted for five years , experts warned last night while homeowners have benefited from low mortgage repayments , at the same time there has been a devastating impact on the lives of savers and an erosion of @entity30 ’s savings culture			1
the consultancy @entity31 said it does not expect the bank to increase the base rate from 0.5 per cent ‘ until late next year			1
’ and even when interest rates do start to rise , the @entity8 has repeatedly made clear that the increases will be ‘ gradual ’			1
@entity36 , head of financial planning at @entity38 , the financial advisers , said : ‘ interest rates look set to remain low for longer			0
‘ even when rates do begin to rise , savers are likely to face several more years of low returns on their hard - earned cash			1
’ a family with a £ 100,000 mortgage is paying around £ 3,300 a year less on interest payments on their loan , according to dr @entity48 , the former @entity49 adviser			1
but savers with a £ 100,000 nest egg are getting around £ 4,260 a year less in interest			1
the @entity8 's governor , @entity54 , used his first speech as governor last august to express his ' tremendous sympathy ' for savers overall , she calculates savers are £ 18,500 worse off since january 2008 , the depth of the financial crisis			1
dr @entity63 said : ‘ the message being sent is : ‘ you ’re a mug to save			0
’ @entity66 , from @entity67 our savers , said : ‘ who could possibly believe that five years on , savers are still being punished ? ‘ it is foolish in the extreme and it is going to end in tears			2
’ ‘ who could possibly believe that five years on , savers are still being punished ? ' @entity66 , save our savers the @entity8 ’s governor , @entity54 , used his first speech as governor last august to express his ‘ tremendous sympathy ’ for savers			1
he said they had ‘ done the right thing , set money aside and now they are earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected			0
’ save our saver ’s research looked at @entity30 ’s £ 1.2trillion balance of cash savings , held in everything from savings accounts to tax - free cash isas			2
it compares how much interest they have been paid for their nest eggs , compared to how much they would have got if rates had been kept at their pre-crisis levels in march 2008			0
the total amount of ‘ lost interest ’ over the last five years is £ 117billion , according to save our savers			1
but this is not the end of the pain inflicted on savers			2
in a second blow , their nest eggs have also been hit by the rising cost of living , which has reduced the spending power of their money			0
the loss of spending power is £ 209billion over the last five years , based on a calculation using the retail prices index measure of inflation			2
this makes a total ‘ loss ’ of £ 326billion			2
to put this vast number into context , this is around 12 times the total amount of money which people will pay in council tax this year			0
by @entity131 , editor of @entity130 , @entity133 's financial section @entity131 : savings rates are terrible right now there is no real way of dressing up savings rates at the moment - they are absolutely awful			0
the first week in march should be the height of what the financial industry calls @entity143 , the time of the year when savers rush to use their tax - free savings allowance before it runs out at the end of the tax year at the start of april			2
this traditionally also means a rush of new savings accounts arriving on the scene , as banks and building societies try to tempt customers away from rivals by nudging up rates			0
this year , @entity160 season is a dud			0
we compile our own independent @entity130 savings tables			0
it 's safe to say we have n't been overwhelmed with the offers trickling in			0
the best rate you can find on an instant access savings account is 1.75 per cent from @entity169 - and even then you are limited to two withdrawals a year			1
the next best easy access account with no limits on withdrawals , which can be opened online is from @entity174 at 1.65 per cent			2
you can get better rates for locking in your money , with the highest rate a 3 per cent five - year fix from @entity180			1
but to get that you have to commit to not getting at your cash until 2019			0
to find the best tax - free savings deal , bookmark this is @entity183 of the best @entity185 round - up , which is updated throughout the year			0
rates like this lead people to question whether it is even worth bothering with an @entity189 but the answer to that question is , ' yes , they make it even more important			0
' this is because we are taxed on our savings interest at our income tax rate , with 20 per cent taken off by your bank and those who pay higher rate tax having to hand over the rest via their tax return			1
that tax eats into the rate you get , driving savings rates even lower			2
but in an @entity160 you get all your interest tax - free			0
if you could find an instant access savings account matching that best @entity189 rate of 1.75 per cent , which incidentally you ca n't , then after 20 per cent tax you would only really be getting 1.4 per cent and after 40 per cent tax you would get 1.05 per cent			1
@entity160 allowances come with a use it , or lose it status			0
everyone can save up to £ 5,760 into an @entity160 this tax year , which ends on 5 april 2014 , it is then gone			2
they then get a new allowance for 2014 to 2015 , of £ 5,940			1
crucially , however , you can put money into a new @entity160 and transfer all your existing @entity160 savings pots into a new better deal if you can find one			0
that means savers need to do two things			0
firstly , make sure new savings go into an @entity160 and that they make the most of their allowance each year and , secondly , make sure all their existing @entity160 savings are getting the best rate possible and move them if need be			1
when savings rates are this bad it only makes more sense to use an @entity189			0

@entity8 made the move to half the base rate to 0.5per cent in 2009
prudent savers have been robbed of more than £ 300bn by decision
@entity247 does not expect the rate to rise until 2015
