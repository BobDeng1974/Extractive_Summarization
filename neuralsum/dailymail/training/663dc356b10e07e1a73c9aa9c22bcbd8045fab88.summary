oh dear , poor @entity0			1
if you have n't heard of her , she 's the 20 - year - old @entity3 beauty salon receptionist who became an overnight @entity6 sensation last week with her ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the @entity9 crisis			1
if you really did miss it - and sadly for @entity0 not many did - it went thus : ' if barraco barner is our president why is he getting involved with @entity16 , scary			1
' she 's had more than her comeuppance for the public display of ignorance , with 7,000 re-tweets of her observation , making news as far away as @entity24 , a flood of comments berating her for her stupidity and the by now familiar online threats of violence and worse			1
not so daft : @entity31 believes beautician @entity0 , right , could build a career on her gaffe she was called a stupid cow , an oxygen thief , warned not to breed and told by one particularly nasty tweeter how he would like to kill her			1
then came those wishing to win political points , citing @entity0 - who has 17 gcses and two a-levels , no less - as a product of our parlous education system			1
how could the nation justify the deep flaws that allowed such ignorance ? finally , the sniggers and fury died down , and there was a collective sigh of relief it was n't one of us who 'd made such an appalling gaffe			0
but i have a feeling it will be @entity0 - and all the other beautiful girls like her - who will have the last laugh			1
they may , as the @entity63 saying goes , have been at the back of the queue when the brains were handed out , but they 'll probably have a far brighter future than young women who model themselves on clever old bluestockings like me			2
comical error : @entity0 's ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the @entity9 crisis think about it			1
@entity0 's had numerous interview requests and been wooed with promises of thousands of pounds for prime - time tv appearances			1
to her credit - so far at least - she has resisted the temptation to make a packet from her notorious gaffe			2
it may , though , only be a matter of time before she succumbs to the pressure to become a public figure , given the tendency to handsomely reward the less educationally advantaged			0
with those 14 ditzy words , @entity0 achieved what millions of well - informed girls - who could find @entity9 on a map in an instant - have failed to do			1
and that 's to be recognised and rewarded			2
times have changed and the value system seems to have gone into reverse			0
i call it ' being @entity99 - fied ' after the millions made by the insufferably vacuous and wholly entertaining ' stars ' of reality show @entity99			2
the ones who hit the headlines and make the money are those who work hard - at being in the gym or at the tanning salon			1
it 's not brains that line your pockets or attract admiration now			2
look at today 's young barristers , who are striking for a day because they earn barely enough to keep them in shoe leather			1
compare their earnings to those of glamour model @entity117 , @entity99 's @entity118 and ditsy x factor finalist @entity119			2
reality tv stars : members of the @entity99 cast have made millions from appearing to be stupid look at the brilliant young graduates pouring out of top universities each year who wind up working in burger bars			0
when i read about @entity0 , it got me thinking about two young women i met at @entity131 on saturday			1
i had my two chihuahuas with me and had been asked to present the @entity134 trophy			0
they accosted me at the entrance to the @entity137 and begged me to buy a bracelet for chihuahua rescue			0
they were smart , charming and kind and i popped the bracelet on as i walked away			0
it was only later i noticed it read ' i love @entity145 's '			2
i spent the rest of the afternoon dreading bumping into @entity148 , who was there too			0
she 's the grammar and punctuation guru who wrote the bestseller , @entity154			2
i 'd have been so ashamed to be seen wearing such a mislaid apostrophe			0
when women like @entity148 and i were young working - class girls , education was rigorous - and it mattered			2
good exam results and a degree were our way of avoiding the kinds of lives which had so restricted our mothers - jobs as cleaners , factory workers or , at best , typists , followed by marriage , children and dependence on a husband			2
last laugh ? @entity0 has been in demand to make media appearances we dressed smartly , made sure our make - up was tasteful and that it would be our brains that would attract employers , who would respect our well - stocked minds and pay us accordingly			1
it was what society then required of us			0
we were expected to set aside the trivial , whether it be make - up , fashion , manicures or costly hairdos , and work hard to make our way professionally			1
for @entity148 and me it worked			0
would we manage to claw our way to the top of the @entity192 pile now , with our perfect grammar , well - honed arguments on foreign politics and ingrained knowledge of the periodic table ? i fear we might not			0
women of our generation have encouraged our own children to take a similar path , only to find them burdened by student debt , struggling to find a decent job , paid peanuts if they do and with no prospect of ever saving enough money for a deposit on a house			1
so , is it us who have actually been the more stupid ? i 'm not saying that @entity0 's obsession with hair extensions and make - up should replace education and hard work for other young women			1
but i do think more might benefit from taking up a similar career , rather than struggling along the academic route only to find no job at the end of it			1
for too long we 've been deluded by the idea that everyone should have a degree to the detriment of our service industries			0
perhaps now we 'll learn to value those not suited to an academic training , but who are hugely important when the electricity goes off or the central heating fails or , in @entity0 's case , when we need a makeover			1
these are , after all , the people we all seem to prefer watching on television ; not boring old academics			0
even those who do n't get famous seem capable of making a far better living than better - educated counterparts - sad though that might be to say			0
when the sun shone last weekend , i abandoned my boots , got out the sandals and noticed what a terrible state my feet were in			0
i doubt i was the only ' clever girl ' making an appointment for a 40 - quid pedicure and 50 - quid leg wax			0
who 's the stupid one now ? and , anyway , is @entity0 really as daft as some would have us believe ? she may not know how to spell @entity252 , she probably has n't a clue where @entity9 is and thinks the @entity254 is something to do with the @entity255			1
nevertheless , she knew that for a @entity257 political leader to be getting involved in a dispute with @entity16 is scary			0
and that observation is not stupid at all			0
maybe next time she will just be wise enough to keep her opinions to the confines of the beauty salon .			0

@entity0 , 20 , became an overnight sensation last week
tweeted ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on @entity9

in @entity31 's day women had to work hard to get degrees for a good job
but now academic success does not *guarantee* a high - *flying* career
