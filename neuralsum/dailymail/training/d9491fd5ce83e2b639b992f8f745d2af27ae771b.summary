by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 12:48 est , 25 april 2013 leaping through the air seemingly into an abyss below , freerunner @entity1 looks certain to fall to his death in the breathtaking landscape of @entity7 in @entity8			1
but @entity1 , 28 , lands safely on another boulder as he performs death defying jumps from rock to rock - wearing little more than a pair of trousers with no safety harness and no shoes			1
while most freerunners chose to master their art in urban landscapes , the intrepid parkour expert prefers to hop from rock to rock in the @entity22			1
@entity1 , from @entity39 , @entity38 was travelling around @entity8 in search of adventure with friend and @entity44 photographer @entity42 , 32 when they stumbled across the unique landscape , a hotspot for rock climbers			1
he said : ' i had been wanting to visit @entity8 for a while			1
parkour was and always is a good way to meet the locals and discover the hidden sides of a country			2
' @entity7 is a paradise			1
the boulders seem to have been put there for the sole purpose of being climbed and jumped			0
' i seized the opportunity to challenge myself in the way that i like best , by facing obstacles that are as mental as they are physical			0
' technically , it 's not a really hard jump , if you 've trained a bit			2
but the challenge for me was to avoid overshooting the landing area , which would have been as troublesome as not jumping far enough			0
preparation : the parkour expert is seen climbing up the side of some ruins sizing up his crucial jump before taking the leap acrobatic : the summit of rocks in @entity8 's @entity7 area offered stunning views while the pair were exploring do n't look down : photographer @entity42 captured some stunning shots of @entity1 performing his death defying stunt ' with stress , you tend to push harder , so i had to resist that urge and stay focused on my landing spot			1
' the height was the biggest danger of this jump			0
falling and dying is usually frowned upon			0
he added : ' when you train parkour , you 're constantly playing with your fear , and little by little you learn to control it , to channel it so that it serves you but does n't paralyse you			2
you never get rid of it entirely , nor should you			0
it 's a self preservation mechanism			0
' after some days , people in town start speaking about the parkour guy who jumps from a boulder to another and i even end up teaching a class , at the request of some of the foreigners there , it 's a really cool place			2
' photographer @entity42 said that the pair had already explored @entity116 and met with a variety of parkour enthusiasts and that they wanted to do something similar in @entity8			1
he said : ' we went simply in search of adventure and experiences			0
@entity1 is hugely talented , he trained extensively with many of the originators of parkour and is widely respected by the global parkour community			1
explorers : photographer @entity42 and @entity1 explored parts of @entity116 before heading to @entity8 relaxing : @entity1 pictured trying to get some sleep among the ruins in @entity34 ' the @entity133 stands on the top of a pronounced hill and offers incredible views for those willing to spend half an hour climbing the steps that weave a path to the top			1
' while visiting the temple , @entity1 spotted a jump that he wanted to do and we decided to return the next day when the light was good			1
' with this sort of jump there is of course the chance of injury and potentially , death , but this is incredibly unlikely given the level of training			0
' we have a developed understanding of danger and risk			0
with ten years of experience , the risks are still present but the danger is negated through judgement and physical skill			0
talented : @entity1 trained extensively with the originators of parkour to learn his trade ' sometimes the jump is easy but looks amazing , other times you only get one chance and you have to get it right first time			1
' on this occasion , @entity1 jumped twice			2
i 'm not sure why he felt the need to repeat it			0
possibly because he is a perfectionist and felt that there was something about his first attempt that needed improvement			0
' the scale of the location made the photographs that we came back with feel even more satisfying , it was definitely the most rewarding location i 've ever photographed			2
