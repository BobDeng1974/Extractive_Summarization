by @entity0 ' shoo - in ' : double olympic gold medallist @entity1 is the ' clear favourite ' to become @entity4 chairman , according to the corporation 's economics editor @entity8 boss @entity1 is a ‘ virtual shoo - in ’ to become the next chairman of the @entity4 , it was claimed yesterday			1
the former track star and head of the @entity13 is expected to replace @entity14 , who stood down after heart surgery in may			1
several candidates are currently being interviewed for the post , including the temporary chair @entity18			1
but writing in his online blog , the @entity4 ’s economics editor @entity19 said he had learned from a ‘ senior government source ’ that @entity1 was the clear favourite			1
he said : ‘ of course his appointment is not 100 per cent , because there is a formal and slightly cumbersome appointments process			2
‘ for the government , which for this sort of thing really means the prime minister and chancellor , @entity1 is the outstanding candidate			1
so presumably they will find a way to get him over these many hurdles			0
’ some speculated yesterday that @entity19 ’s source was the chancellor @entity34			2
@entity19 is currently shadowing @entity34 ’s official trade mission to @entity36 , and the chancellor is known to be a close friend of @entity1 ’s			1
lord @entity1 ’s appointment would be popular with @entity41 mps			1
unlike @entity14 – who is now advising the @entity42 on media relations – he is seen as a ‘ true conservative ’ , and he served as a @entity41 mp for five years			1
the double @entity8 gold medallist has also worked with @entity4 director general @entity47 , who sat on the @entity48			1
lord @entity1 was first rumoured to be in line for the @entity4 chairman role in may			2
at the time , @entity52 mayor @entity51 appeared to inadvertently confirm the story when he said that he would be a ‘ first - rate choice ’			0
lord @entity1 has not confirmed or denied the reports , although he has said he would be ‘ very flattered ’ to be considered a contender			2
yesterday , another contender for the £ 110,000 job – former @entity59 head @entity57 – ruled herself out of contention for the post , saying she felt the current @entity4 structure was ‘ hopelessly confused			2
’ she said : ‘ i think that hopeless confusion has served the @entity4 and the licence fee payers very ill , despite the enormous efforts of good people to try and make it work			0
there is no desire or inclination among the powers that be to change the system			0
i have n’t applied , i do n’t intend to apply			0
’ endorsement : in his blog , @entity19 ( left ) said the former track star is the frontrunner to replace @entity14 ( right ) who stepped down in may following heart surgery dame @entity57 also called for the @entity4 to scrap the licence fee and replace it with a subscription model			1
she said : i have to say it seems to be a no brainer moment to look at conditional access funding			0
why not ? why would n’t they do it ? i have n’t seen a single argument that persuaded me that some kind of conditional access would n’t be a good thing			0
’ her comments were echoed by @entity92 chairman @entity91 , who also said he did not want the @entity4 chairman post			0
he said : ‘ can you really imagine in 30 years ’ time there will be a licence fee ? in the long term you have to get to a position where people who do n’t pay ca n’t watch it			0
the @entity4 would be a not for profit company , it would still have a charter , it would still have various privileges , but it would have to persuade people to pay for it			0

double @entity8 gold medallist is expected to replace @entity14
appointment would be popular with @entity41 mps as he is a ' true conservative '
several candidates are currently being interviewed for the post
however @entity19 said @entity1 was the frontrunner on his blog
