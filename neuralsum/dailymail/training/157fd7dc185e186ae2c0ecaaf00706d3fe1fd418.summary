by @entity1 reporter published : 06:30 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 28 november 2013 men 's emotions are stirred more by the sight of a beautiful car than a crying baby , according to state - of - the - art brainwave analysis			2
but women are clearly governed by maternal rather than motoring instincts as their emotional response to the wail of an infant was found to be double that of the brain activity observed when looking at a car , the study revealed			1
the research shows that men are ' genetically programmed ' to drool over a flash motor , said car giant @entity20 , who commissioned the tests			1
stirring : men 's emotions are affected more by flash cars than crying babies , according to a study published on thursday some may argue that the test results are self - serving for @entity20 , but sophisticated technology was involved in the study , with both men and women being wired up to specialist machines that monitor the electrical impulses in the brain			1
the impulses indicate the brain 's emotional responses - the stronger the impulses , the greater the emotions being felt			2
the volunteers were then shown visual images of cars considered to be plain , ugly or beautiful – they included a futuristic @entity20 prototype , not the functional saloons the maker is famous for - 1950s models and @entity46			1
they were also shown photos of men and women and crying babies			0
female feelings : women reacted strongest to the image of a baby it found the strongest brain impulses among men was to a picture of a beautiful woman , followed by that of a curvy ' concept ' coupe with a crying baby picture down in third			1
women , however , reacted strongest to the image of a baby and then to the picture of an attractive man more than any feelings towards a beautiful motor			0
@entity20 , which claims the experiment to be the first of its kind , said it shows how the design of a car and evoke powerful feelings ' on a par with the most basic of human emotions '			1
the @entity80 company said it was trying to design models that would build an ' emotive connection ' with owners			0
in a separate survey of 2,000 adults , four in ten ( 43 per cent ) men said the design of a car was more important than added extras or the feel of the interior			0
@entity20 design chief @entity91 said : ‘ this survey finally proves what we 've always suspected			2
‘ beautiful car design can elicit strong emotional responses ranging from a positive frame of mind to a sense of empowerment			2
’ neuroscientist dr @entity101 said : ‘ appreciating an aesthetically pleasing design is an experience which combines understanding and emotions			0
‘ these are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to distinguish between them			0
‘ aesthetic experience involves a unity of sensuous delight , meaningful interpretation , and emotional involvement			0

volunteers had their brainwaves analysed in a test commissioned by @entity20
women found to be more maternal as their emotional response to the wails of an infant was double to that of a car
the maker claims the experiment is the first of its kind
