a central @entity1 penthouse has become @entity2 's most expensive ever flat after a wealthy @entity3 reportedly bought it for £ 140million - despite it not having any furnishings , flooring or internal walls			1
the 16,000sq ft ' core and shell ' property is part of the exclusive one @entity13 development in @entity14 , and is believed to have been purchased by a man from @entity16 or @entity17			1
concrete walls , floor - length windows and one of the most exclusive views in the world is all the new homeowner will have got for his money			2
record : the unfurnished penthouse flat is one of four at the exclusive one @entity13 apartments in @entity14 ( pictured ) , and is believed to have been purchased by a man from either @entity16 or @entity17 experts estimate he will have to spend hundreds of thousands more dividing the penthouse into rooms and installing the luxuries befitting one of the country 's most expensive addresses			1
according to the property 's developers , after the flat is fully furnished it could command prices of between £ 160million and £ 175million			1
as part of the deal the new owner will also have access to the services of 80 hotel staff who maintain the properties and provide housekeeping , room service and security			2
the property - known as @entity52 - is one of four at one @entity13 , and consists of the entire top floor of one of the towers , which sit between @entity14 and the southern border of @entity13 , five minutes walk from @entity59 department store			1
the sale was today confirmed by the property developers			2
it is thought the deal has been in the works for months			0
properties costing most than £ 2million attract high rates of stamp duty - which for this penthouse could hit £ 21million			1
the rate for properties bought by individuals is capped at 7 per cent - in this case £ 9.8million - but if a corporate body purchased it on the man 's behalf , stamp duty is charged at 15 per cent - which would be £ 21million			1
a spokesman for @entity76 , the developers of the property , told @entity79 : ' a 16,000 sq ft duplex @entity52 ( @entity52 ) at one @entity13 was recently sold			1
@entity76 is not able to comment on the sale price or the purchaser '			2
describing the currently bare property , the spokesman continued : ' it 's a shell and core unit - concrete walls , concrete floors , no rooms or walls put in yet - the owner can decide on their preferred layout for their needs or lifestyle			1
luxury : when the one @entity13 apartments first went on sale at the start of 2011 , every inch of their polished marble floors contrasted sharply with the state of @entity2 's economy , which was deep in recession ( file image ) demand : one @entity13 has become a ' luxury ghetto ' for some of the world ¿ s richest people , including @entity110 sheikhs , @entity112 oil tycoons and @entity114 's former boyfriend , @entity113 ( file image ) ' they can decide how many bedrooms , kitchens , or whatever it is they want			2
the property runs the length of the building - from the park side to the city side			0
at one end you ’ll have views of @entity13 , and at the other end you ’ll have views of @entity14 and @entity59 and so on			2
you only get that in the penthouses and in the five - bedroom units , where you get the entirety of one level			0
' the value for the sale and nationality of the buyer was reported in @entity139			0
all four penthouses in the development are now spoken for , and the only one @entity13 property still on offer from the developers is a three - bedroom flat , which is likely to be worth around £ 15million			1
it is thought that a flat in @entity2 has never sold for so much before			0
in 2011 another one @entity13 penthouse was sold for £ 136million			2
it was also reported last year that a mansion in @entity152 - 18 @entity151 - was on the market for £ 250million , but it is not clear whether a sale was made			2
as well as being a new high - water mark in the property market , the suspected nationality of the buyer has added to evidence that rich eastern @entity160 are offloading their wealth into @entity1 in the wake of political unrest in @entity17			1
it will also add to the mounting fears that @entity2 's property market - particularly in @entity1 , where foreign interest is high - is in danger of crashing			1
a report released by @entity170 yesterday warned that house prices across the board are rising at their fastest pace for nearly seven years			0
according to the research , the average home costing nearly £ 18,000 more than it did last year , building society said yesterday			0
@entity178 , chief executive of the building society , warned : ‘ we need to watch the situation carefully			0
’ in just one year , house prices have jumped by 10.9 per cent , the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010 and the highest rate since june 2007			0
new figures this week also revealed a booming trade in the most expensive houses , with 33 @entity2 homes selling for £ 1million or more every day			0
concerns : a number of people , including sir @entity194 ( left ) , are worried that @entity1 's high - end property bubble may be about to burst			1
the @entity196 ( right ) recently sold off £ 240million of luxury property @entity199 statistics reveal that in january this year there were 1,011 houses sold in this price bracket , with most going in @entity1 and the @entity203			1
the figure is almost double that for january 2013			0
it came as a deputy governor of the @entity207 issued a strong warning that @entity2 ’s housing market is spiralling out of control			0
sir @entity194 , deputy governor for financial stability , said the housing market was a ' blinking warning light ' , and indeed ' the brightest light on that dashboard '			0
he added that it would be ‘ dangerous to ignore the momentum that has built up ’ , given the well - established history of boom - and - bust in the @entity2 property market			0
however , not everyone is so optimistic about the future of luxury property in the capital			0
earlier this week the property company owned by the @entity196 said it had sold £ 240million of luxury homes in central @entity1 amid fears the capital 's house price bubble may be about the burst			1
@entity231 said it was cutting its exposure to high - end residential properties after growing concerned that the rate of growth in the @entity1 luxury house price market was unsustainable			1
the company - which is controlled by @entity238 , one of @entity2 's richest men - says it is branching out from its traditional @entity152 and @entity241 turf , and targeting more affordable rental homes south of the river in @entity244 .			0
