it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			0
@entity5 bagged a brace for @entity7 on thursday night , but his double against minnows @entity8 is unlikely to rescue his @entity11 career			1
what 's hot @entity5 the @entity13 scored twice against @entity8 and the skies did not turn dark and deadly plagues did not strike			1
but looking at @entity8 ’s starting @entity18 , his @entity11 resurgence is not a sure thing			2
@entity5 celebrates the second of his two goals for @entity7 in their friendly against @entity8 @entity5 pierces through the hapless @entity8 defence on thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time @entity25 or rather his massive calves			1
he gets severe cramps , poor chap , so needs a special anti-inflammatory cream			2
alas , he does n’t have @entity31 medical insurance and so each small tube costs £ 1,200			1
the £ 95m he is set to make from fighting @entity33 should help			0
@entity25 's trainer @entity34 ( right ) revealed his fighter suffers from bad leg cramps in training @entity38 the @entity40 golfer played one of the most absurd holes in memory at the par - four 17th in the @entity44			2
he hooked his drive way left and went to look for it in the woods but declared it unplayable			0
he returned to the tee , reloaded and holed his drive from 336 yards for a birdie three			0
@entity52 ( 2001 @entity53 ) has the only par - four ace in @entity56 history			0
what 's not @entity58 the @entity59 ( below ) has gone rogue			2
this time he ’s blaming his @entity62 car for last month ’s crash in practice – a version of events disputed by a 37 - page report , numerous experts and 300 sensors on the car			1
@entity58 is blaming his @entity62 car for last month ’s crash in practice @entity72 sad to see a career that has drawn so much derision end with the revelation he is suffering brain injuries and faces bankruptcy			1
boxers are a stubborn lot and @entity72 was deluded , by his own admission , but those around him should have been stronger			0
@entity72 is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after retiring from boxing @entity84 poor old @entity84			1
he jumps through all the hoops to play for @entity86 in a competition that no - one really watches , all so he can maybe , hopefully , possibly play for @entity89 again ... if an asteroid strikes the bus carrying all the selectors			0
who could have known that years of egotistical behaviour and slagging off your captain would count for so much ? @entity97 feels @entity84 's efforts to play himself back into the @entity99 will be in vain			0
