by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 12:08 est , 13 january 2014 relatives of a murdered retired postmistress have criticised police who initially treated her death as an accident - even though she was repeatedly stabbed and set on fire			1
detectives still working on the unsolved killing of 86 - year - old @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of the confusion			1
her body was discovered by relative @entity18 , 77 , when he called at her bungalow to take her for a day out last january			1
she had suffered serious burns and multiple stab wounds			0
death : @entity11 , 86 , with her late husband @entity26			1
detectives still working on her unsolved killing have admitted that vital clues may have been destroyed because of early confusion probe : an officer stands outside the @entity12 home where @entity33 was found murdered in january 2013 however , officers first thought she had accidentally set herself on fire			1
they told mr @entity18 and his wife @entity36 , 70 , that they were free to enter her home and sort through her belongings			0
but three days later they dramatically changed their minds and launched a murder investigation , telling @entity18 and mrs @entity42 the bungalow was now a crime scene			1
a post-mortem found mrs @entity33 had been stabbed repeatedly - including through the heart and lungs - and then set on fire by her killer			1
mr and mrs @entity42 complained to the @entity50 and said they had felt ‘ very let down ’ by @entity52			0
now , one year after her death , the force has admitted key evidence could have been lost as a result of the confusion			2
investigation : police officers in @entity13 first thought mrs @entity11 had accidentally set herself on fire evidence : a post-mortem found mrs @entity33 had been stabbed repeatedly - including through the heart and lungs - and then set on fire by her killer mrs @entity42 , from @entity12 , said : ‘ i was surprised when the police said it was an accident			1
after a few days the point was proved			0
we got home and within half an hour the police arrived and told us it was a homicide			2
’ mystery : mrs @entity33 , who lived alone , was last seen alive on january 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day police officers said the family ’s complaint to the @entity50 had been ‘ locally resolved ’ and mrs @entity33 ’s relatives were content with this			2
detective chief inspector @entity82 said : ‘ there was a problem with the first two days in that the officers that attended were under the impression this was a tragic accident			0
‘ officers made the assumption that it was a non-suspicious death			0
there is always the potential , as a result of that , we may not have been as quick off the mark as we should have been			0
‘ we are absolutely determined that we will do everything to bring the offender to justice and to bring closure to @entity103 ’s family			0
’ mrs @entity33 , who lived alone , was last seen alive on january 11 but spoke to a friend by telephone at about 5pm the following day			0
police believe she was murdered some time before 9pm			2
a £ 10,000 @entity108 reward has been offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of mrs @entity11 ’s killer			1
det @entity113 added : ‘ we still believe the answer to this crime lies in the local community and we need their help			0
‘ i would urge people to think back to this time a year ago , did a friend or loved one come home with blood on them or smelling of smoke ? were they acting strangely around that time ? did they suddenly come into money ? ‘ any information , no matter how small or insignificant it may seem , could prove crucial to solving this terrible crime and giving some closure to mrs @entity33 ’s family who are desperate for answers			2
