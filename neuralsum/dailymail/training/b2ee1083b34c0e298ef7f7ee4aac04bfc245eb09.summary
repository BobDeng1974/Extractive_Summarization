i 'm surprised that @entity1 have n't been charged by the @entity2			2
when @entity1 fans unfurled a banner on saturday during the game with @entity6 at @entity7 , i was shocked			1
it read : ' @entity10 's dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game			1
' split into two sections , the banner was so large it stretched across 20 to 25 people at least			0
he could even take action against @entity1 for allowing the banner to be shown			2
there is no way that banner should have been allowed into the ground			0
@entity1 should be charged , although leniency should be shown to the club because stewards took it down swiftly			0
there is an irony with all this moralising and sermonising among the @entity7 faithful			0
@entity1 is a club that has hit hard times in the past			0
so hard that they had to go into administration less than five years ago			0
going into administration means they got away with not having to pay all their bills in full			0
the players are looked after â€“ when the @entity69 are n't busy supporting any of their members who are convicted rapists , they make sure all footballers get their wages even when a club is in crisis , and on the brink of extinction			0
@entity1 co-chairman @entity77 ( left ) helped the club out of administration back in 2010 @entity80 's free - kick nestles in the back of @entity83 's net to give @entity18 's side the lead @entity1 fans unveil a ' @entity88 ' banner display before facing @entity35 last season no , it 's the less well - paid employees who wo n't get paid up , and the small businesses who do n't receive money owed to them when a football club sinks into administration			1
twenty - nine people were made redundant when @entity1 took that route in january 2010			1
this situation where ordinary working folk lose their jobs or do n't get what 's owed to them by @entity1 and other clubs who go into administration , is apparently fine with these pompous high and mighty @entity1 fans , who think they have the right to write libellous words on a banner and display it in front of thousands at a public event			1
and can they back up their claims ? @entity23 ( second from right ) has spent huge amounts of money since taking control of @entity6 if they have any evidence of ' dirty money ' they should take it to the relevant authorities			1
the hypocrisy of a group of fans who ignore their own club 's past financial mismanagement and instead make unsubstantiated claims about the owner of another is breathtaking			1
will @entity1 take any action against the individuals who made and displayed the banner ? i hope so			2
@entity77 has always acted and spoken with class and integrity as co-chairman of @entity1 , i hope he continues to do that and protects the integrity of his @entity6 counterpart .			2

@entity1 fans unfurled a banner reading ' @entity10 's dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game ' at @entity7
the banner was in *reference* to @entity23 , owner of @entity6
the south @entity157 club *deserve* to be charged by the @entity2
@entity1 's financial mismanagement left them in administration in 2010 - businesses were left *unpaid* and *29* staff were made redundant
co-chairman @entity77 should take action against the fans *responsible*
