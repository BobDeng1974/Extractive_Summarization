by @entity0 for @entity1 spontaneously moving your hands to illustrate a point can help boost a child 's language development , researchers say			0
gesture - plus - word combinations can make it easier for children to grasp what certain words and phrases mean - even during sign language			1
the findings back up previous research which found gesticulating helps youngsters develop their language , learning and cognitive skills			1
researchers at the @entity23 say gestures help children learn ( stock image shown )			1
study says it helps kids develop their language , learning and cognitive skills			1
gesture is a flexible way of communicating , one that can work with language to communicate or , if necessary , can itself become language in 2009 , dr @entity38 and her team found that boys and girls whose parents gesticulate a lot have bigger vocabularies when they start school			1
advocating that parents start talking with their hands , the researchers said that simple gestures from nodding and shaking of the head to indicate yes and no , to flapping of the arms to indicate flying , could make all the difference			0
the @entity54 researchers studied the actions and gestures used by 50 toddlers and their parents as they played together			0
the researchers said simple gestures such as pointing prompted parents to introduce children to new words			2
writing in the journal @entity66 , they said : ' for example , in response to a child 's point at a doll , a mother might say " yes , that 's a doll " , thus providing a word for the object that is the focus of the child 's attention			0
' the connection could also be more direct , with gestures allowing children to use their hands practice meanings of words they have difficulty in pronouncing			2
encouraging parents and children to talk with their hands could prove to be a cheap and easy way of boosting youngsters ' word power and better preparing them for school			1
' talk to your children more , gesture more , ' said co-researcher dr @entity94			2
the new study , by dr @entity96 , from the @entity23 , examined how gesturing contributes to language learning in hearing and in deaf children			1
she concluded that gesture is a flexible way of communicating , one that can work with language to communicate or , if necessary , can itself become language			0
' children who can hear use gesture along with speech to communicate as they acquire spoken language , ' dr @entity38 said			1
' those gesture - plus - word combinations precede and predict the acquisition of word combinations that convey the same notions			1
' the findings make it clear that children have an understanding of these notions before they are able to express them in speech			0
' in addition to children who learned spoken languages , dr @entity38 studied children who learned sign language from their parents			2
she found that they too use gestures as they use @entity127			0
these gestures predict learning , just like the gestures that accompany speech			0
finally , dr @entity38 looked at deaf children whose hearing losses prevented them from learning spoken language , and whose hearing parents had not presented them with conventional sign language			1
these children use homemade gesture systems , called homesign , to communicate			0
homesign shares properties in common with natural languages but is not a full - blown language , perhaps because the children lack ' a community of communication partners , ' dr @entity38 writes			2
nevertheless , homesign can be the ' first step toward an established sign language			0
' in @entity147 , individual gesture systems blossomed into a more complex , shared system when homesigners were brought together for the first time			0
the gesture learning technique is apparently true for both hearing children and those who sign ( research image shown )			1
gesture - plus - word combinations can make it easier for children to understand what certain words and phrases mean , which makes it easier for them to pick up language more quickly at school these findings provide insight into gesture 's contribution to learning			1
gesture plays a role in learning for signers even though sign itself is based around gestures			2
as a result , gesture can not aid learners simply by providing a second language			0
rather , gesture adds imagery to the categorical distinctions that form the core of both spoken and sign languages			0
dr @entity38 concludes that gesture can be the basis for a self - made language , assuming linguistic forms and functions when other vehicles are not available			2
but when a conventional spoken or sign language is present , gesture works along with language , helping to promote learning			1
the study will be published in @entity194 .			0

@entity23 study says it helps develop language , learning and cognitive skills
the same is true for both hearing children and those who sign
gesture - plus - word combinations can make it easier for children to understand what certain words and phrases mean
makes it easier for children to pick up language more quickly at school
