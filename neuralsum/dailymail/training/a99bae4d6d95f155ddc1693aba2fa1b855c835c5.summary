since her marriage to prince @entity2 in april 2011 @entity0 has become known around the world as the @entity0			1
but now one historian , who has avidly studied @entity0 's royal 's family tree , claims that the 32 - year - old could well have the wrong title			1
@entity9 , an @entity10 historian , believes that the new mother could lay claim to the title of @entity0 of @entity14 thanks to her strong links to the city			1
has she got the wrong title ? a historian claims that the @entity0 could be named the @entity0 of @entity14 because her ancestors all studied there mr @entity9 , a history lecturer at @entity19 in @entity20 , has long had an interest in the future @entity22 , who recently announced she was pregnant with her second child			1
he began researching her ancestors because he wanted to prove claims that she was a ' commoner ' wrong			0
during his extensive research , he discovered that the 32 - year - old 's grandfather , @entity29 , as well as other relatives , all studied at the esteemed @entity31			0
speaking to the @entity32 , he said : ' we ’ve done a lot of research in the past few months which suggests that when @entity0 does eventually get to @entity14 she should be called the @entity0 of @entity14 because many of her family studied there			2
' i would say that there is a stronger argument for @entity0 to have been given an @entity14 title			2
' mr @entity9 , who is penning a book based on his research , discovered that @entity0 ’s grandfather studied @entity47 at @entity48 in 1939 , before leaving to train as a pilot during the @entity50			1
wrong city ? @entity9 believes that the new mother could lay claim to the title of @entity0 of @entity14 thanks to her strong links to the city , pictured fate ? mr @entity9 discovered that @entity0 's grandfather , @entity29 , left , as well as other relatives , all studied at the esteemed @entity31 - and later worked as prince @entity59 ’s co-pilot on their two - month @entity61 tour in 1962 , he found himself working as prince @entity59 ’s co-pilot on their two - month @entity61 tour			1
and it was n't just @entity0 's grandfather , who passed away in 2010 , who has links to @entity14			2
mr @entity9 has revealed that mr @entity29 's great - great - grandfather ’s brother , dr @entity66 , was principal of @entity68 in @entity14 , as was mr @entity29 's great - grandfather 's brother , @entity69 mr @entity29 ’s great - uncle , the @entity72 lord mayor @entity71 , also attended @entity73			2
big day : @entity0 left behind her commoner roots and her name became @entity76 of @entity77 when she married @entity2 in 2011 @entity78 was the last @entity79 back in 1703			1
mr @entity9 added : ' given that she ’s going to be the @entity22 at some point , we might as well get the background right			0
' @entity0 left behind her commoner roots and her name became @entity76 of @entity77 when she married @entity2 in 2011			1
she also became @entity0 the countess of @entity85 and @entity0 – though the titles are used only rarely , mainly in @entity87 , where they met and fell in love , and @entity90 respectively			0
baby on board : earlier this month , the country rejoiced when it was announced that the @entity0 is pregnant again all titles are gifts from the @entity22 , but her majesty conferred them following private discussions with her grandson and his bride			0
the @entity77 has been a royal title since the reign of @entity102 the first @entity77 was a @entity104 prince who only lived for a few months , followed by others who were styled with title but also died very young			0
@entity107 , @entity108 , also held the title and went on to become @entity110 he was the last @entity47 monarch to lead his troops into battle - at @entity113 in 1743			0
the title - a popular name for pubs - links @entity2 to the city where his father , the @entity118 , went to university			2
earlier this month , the country rejoiced when it was announced that the @entity0 is pregnant again			0
but the spare is proving as troublesome for the @entity0 as the heir - @entity124 officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because @entity0 , right , is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum .			0

@entity9 , an @entity10 historian , makes claim
could lay claim to title of @entity0 of @entity14 thanks to strong links to city
grandfather and other ancestors studied there
@entity0 became @entity0 when she married @entity2 in 2011
