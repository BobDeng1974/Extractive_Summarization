from the terrifying @entity4 to a delicate @entity5 whose abdomen glitters like a disco ball , a photographer has got up close and personal with arachnids living on @entity8 â€™s 64 islands to capture them in all their @entity11 glory			1
@entity12 used macro photography to make sure every tiny detail of the mini beasts were documented from the astoundingly long horns of the @entity17 to the menacing jaws of the @entity19 and mesmerising almost human - like eyes of the @entity21 that weaves a web between its front legs to throw at unsuspecting prey			1
while some people might be afraid by these arachnids , mr @entity12 's photos show the incredible tactics used by spiders to hide and hunt as well as stand out and mimic less - tasty insects			1
the @entity5 is a member of @entity33 family and has shiny , reflective patches on its abdomen that might be composed of guanine crystals , which have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders ' bodies the @entity5 lives in @entity8 and the silvery tiles on its abdomen expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest ( pictured ) and apparently shrink when it is on the move or scared , according to the photographer @entity8 is known for being an urban jungle , but its tropical climate is also home to a host of species of spiders and insects that thrive in the warm and moist environment			1
writing on his blog , mr @entity12 said : ' every year , i make a few trips to the tropical rainforests in the region as they certainly have a different diversity of critters compared to the local ones			1
' he started photographing spiders in the summer of 2008 after getting his first high - end camera - a @entity66 and a macro lens , the @entity64			1
while he subsequently upgraded to a better lens he mixes up his set - up but has now reverted to using his first lens around 99 per cent of the time			2
the @entity72 looks like a bird dropping by day but by night , it constructs a large silk structure , lined with sticky droplets , to catch prey it has an armoured abdomen and under uv light glows a brilliant blue mr @entity12 almost always uses a handheld set - up to get close to the spiders , but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects			1
he said : ' shooting handheld allows me to keep more than 3 times as many shots as i would normally have if i shot on a tripod ... as there is no perfect macro setup , i change my flash setup every now and then			2
' he has studied the movement and markings of the @entity5 , a member of the @entity96 family , which has shiny , reflective patches on its abdomen , which might be composed of guanine crystals , that have been found to be a source of colour on some spiders ' bodies , @entity91 reported			1
as its name suggests he @entity107 deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators believe that it also tastes foul the @entity19 looks like a red weaver ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders			2
it also has a fake ' waist ' so that it looks like it has three parts ( tagmata ) of its body like a real ant and waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant 's antennae they are commonly known in @entity8 as ' sequined ' spiders and mr @entity12 has noted that the sliver tiles on the spider 's abdomen appear to shrink when it is scared or angry to show its ' real ' body			1
the reflective tiles expand to make its body appear completely silver when it is at rest and apparently shrink when it is on the move , he said			2
mr @entity12 has photographed a number of spiders that mimic other insects and features of their local habitat			1
the @entity72 looks like a bird dropping by day but by night , the arachnid constructs a large silk structure lined with sticky droplets , to catch prey			2
it has an armoured abdomen and under uv light glows a brilliant blue			2
the eight - @entity154 looks a little crab - like and is bright yellow to deter predators the terrifying @entity158 is well camouflaged by appearing as an extension of a tree stump			0
the creature apparently draws its legs up beneath it and covers its face to look more stump - like when it is frightened as its name suggests , the @entity166 deliberately looks like the spotty insect in a bid to make predators believe it also tastes foul			0
the @entity19 spider looks like a @entity173 ant and has a slimmer abdomen than most spiders			1
it also has a fake ' waist ' so that it looks like it has three parts ( tagmata ) of its body like a real ant			0
the spider even waves its front pair of legs in front of its head to mimic an ant 's antennae , which has the added bonus of making it look like it has six legs			1
the spiders have evolved patches of colour around one of their pairs of eyes , which makes them look like they have two compound eyes , rather than eight simple eyes like most other spiders			0
their bodies are covered with tiny reflective hairs so they look like the shiny bodies of ants			0
the @entity209 has strikingly long horns , although its is not known why they have evolved this way the @entity213 has front - facing , almost human-esque eyes , but while she might look relatively friendly , the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs and throws it at prey ant - mimicking spiders can behave more like ants than spiders too by moving in a zig - zag pattern and contrary to their name , @entity19 jumping spiders actually avoid jumping so not to blow their cover			1
biologists believe they go to such lengths in a bid to avoid being eaten by predators who hunt by sight , including birds , lizards and larger spiders			0
however , the spiders themselves prey on real ants and aphids			2
the eight - @entity154 spider looks a little crab - like but is a bright yellow colour to deter predators			0
by contrast , the terrifying @entity158 is well camouflaged by appearing as an extension of a tree stump			0
the creature apparently draws its legs up beneath it and covers its face to look more stump - like when it is frightened			0
the @entity209 has strikingly long horns , although its is not known why they have evolved this way			0
mr @entity12 almost always uses a handheld set - up with his camera equipped with a macro lens and home - made lighting to get close to the spiders and other insects ( pictured ) , but switches to using a tripod for specific subjects his detailed photographic method can capture tiny creatures such as these @entity265 that have neon yellow bodies the @entity213 has front - facing , almost human-esque eyes			1
while it might seem at first - glance that the spider only has two eyes , its four smaller ones are positioned very close by			0
but while she might look relatively friendly , the spider spins her sticky web between her front four legs			0
once the trap is set , she waits for prey and then hurls the net , and herself at it in a terrifying attack			0
the spider belongs to the @entity285 family , which stretches their webs and releases them to trap prey - but most of the family does not actively move the web once they are in place .			0

photographer @entity12 used a macro lens to capture details of spiders living on the islands off @entity8
he photographed ' sequined ' spiders to show sliver tiles on the spider 's abdomen appear to shrink when it 's scared or angry
he also captured spiders that mimic other insects like ants and *ladybirds* and features of their local habitat such as tree stumps and bird dung
