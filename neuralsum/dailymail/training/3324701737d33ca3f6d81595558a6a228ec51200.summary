the nation ’s drug enforcement czar disagrees with president @entity2 about the dangers of smoking marijuana			1
@entity6 head @entity5 supposedly told a recent closed - door sheriff ’s conference that she is n’t happy with the federal government ’s willingness to allow states to legalize the plant			1
@entity5 expressed her frustration with the country ’s increasingly relaxed attitude towards marijuana in the wake of president @entity2 recently telling the @entity19 he does n’t think it ’s dangerous			1
acting @entity6 administrator @entity5 , pictured at a 2009 news conference , is upset with president @entity2 over recent moves to allow marijuana legalization she ’s frustrated for the same reasons we are , @entity25 county sheriff @entity24 told the @entity28			1
“ she said she felt the administration did n’t understand the science enough to make those statements			0
‘ she [ also ] said her lowest point in 33 years in the @entity6 was when she learned they ’d flown a hemp flag over the @entity35 on july 4 , ’ @entity24 continued			1
‘ the sheriffs were all shocked , this is the first time in 28 years i ’ve ever heard anyone in her position be this candid			0
' she was also infuriated that the @entity42 played a softball game with a ‘ pro-legalization group , ’ @entity24 added			0
her pot shots at the president were not made in public , but they came after recent comments he made to the @entity19 raised more than a few eyebrows			1
‘ i view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that i smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life , ’ said the president			0
‘ i do n’t think it is more dangerous than alcohol , ’ he continued , adding that he believes it is even less damaging ‘ in terms of its impact on the individual consumer			0
’ the flag was flown at the urging of @entity71 rep @entity69 ( @entity72 ) and made of industrial hemp			1
under fire : president @entity2 makes remarks at a thursday reception , he is being criticized by the head of the @entity6 for his relaxed attitude towards marijuana the @entity82 announced last summer it would no longer seek to stop states from legalizing recreational marijuana			1
the president 's evolving stance may just be a reflection of the country as a whole – almost 60 per cent of @entity90 ’s are in favour of legalization , according to @entity93 – but that does n’t sit well with @entity5			2
‘ this is a woman who has spent 33 years of her life fighting drug abuse in the @entity6 , her entire life , ’ @entity95 , @entity96 , sheriff @entity97 explained			2
‘ to have the president of the @entity90 publicly say marijuana was a bad habit like alcohol was appalling to everyone in that room			2
‘ i think the way that she felt was that it was a betrayal of what she does for the @entity90 people in enforcing our drug laws			0
... she got a standing ovation , ’ he added			0
rep. @entity69 , ( @entity118 ) nbholds an @entity90 flag made of hemp on the floor of the @entity122 last year authorities have long contended marijuana is a gateway drug that leads to more serious addictions like cocaine , heroin and more , @entity24 explained			1
having the president make those remarks sends children mixed signals			0
‘ the last person we need saying this to kids is the president of the @entity90			0
’ a source told the @entity138 may lose her job over the comments , but a spokesperson made an attempt to clarify them in an email to the @entity145			0
' with regards to the @entity28 story , i think its important to clarify that the administrator 's remarks were not at against the president , as the story portrays , but continued messages that the @entity6 is not in support of legalization -- and neither is the @entity6			2
