few men are better placed to judge the duel between @entity4 strikers @entity2 and @entity5 thursday night in the @entity6 in @entity7 than @entity8			1
the giant 23 - year - old defender sits next to the @entity11 striker in the @entity4 dressing room , or at least did do until he went out on loan to @entity15 ’s @entity14 in january			1
that ’s @entity14 , the former club of @entity5 , who took @entity8 under his wing when he joined @entity4 back in 2011			1
' @entity2 is similar to @entity5 in as much as he ’s always looking to score , always trying to force a mistake from the opponent and take advantage of any weakness , ' he says of the scorer of @entity11 ’s goal against @entity26 on saturday			1
in action : @entity2 impressed up front against @entity26 in @entity11 's 2 - 1 opening loss fighting fit ? @entity5 missed @entity15 's opening game , but is ready for the @entity11 clash @entity8 will be on hand to inform @entity34 first choice centre - backs @entity35 and @entity36 , although after seeing how @entity39 loanee @entity38 destroyed the @entity15 defence , many supporters want @entity8 drafted in ahead of the defender @entity42 let go last month			1
@entity8 is also well aware of the other threats carried by @entity11			2
' @entity44 is extremely quick , always looking to get past people and deliver the ball into the box , ' he says			0
' and [ @entity49 ] @entity48 has so much intelligence and quality in that midfield role ; we are very aware of how good he is from dead balls , he strikes it so well			0
' of course for all that @entity11 have @entity44 and @entity2 , @entity15 have the real jewel in the @entity4 crown			1
' everyone knows what @entity5 is like , ' says @entity8			2
' he never gives up on a single loose ball ; he chases everything			0
it does n’t matter if the team is winning or losing , he always wants more			0
he is one of the three best players in the world			0
' @entity15 will need all of @entity5 ’ quality and determination to turn their @entity68 around			1
@entity8 says his spirit illustrates perfectly why they have over-achieved so often on the world stage and why they are not about to give up their place at the @entity68 lightly			2
team - mates : @entity8 ( centre ) shares a joke with @entity5 during @entity15 training through his paces : @entity8 ( in red ) attempts to block a shot from @entity83 in training ' in @entity85 i think there are three million players officially signed up with clubs , and in @entity15 there are only three million people so that puts the size of our country into perspective			1
but we are passionate about the game ; everyone plays from a very young age , and we have the guts and determination that you see reflected in the way @entity5 plays			2
he ’s the perfect example of how never to give anything up for lost			0
' @entity8 showed the same fighting spirit last season to come back from the torn cruciate ligament injury he suffered in august and then ask for a loan move to @entity14 that would give him a fighting chance of making @entity111 ’ @entity68 squad			1
he had just been voted @entity112 of the @entity113 which @entity15 won in 2011 when @entity4 signed him that summer			2
@entity5 was in constant contact as the deal went through informing him of @entity4 ’s interest and joking that he would ‘ represent ’ him in @entity11			1
he helped him settle , but the injury while playing for @entity15 in @entity118 set back his progress			2
world stage : @entity2 hits home @entity11 's equaliser at the time in saturday 's clash against @entity26 @entity8 ' performances at @entity14 were enough to convince @entity111 that he was ready for @entity85			1
and back home in @entity15 he was able to witness first hand just how @entity5 has turned the country into the @entity129 branch of the @entity4 ’s supporters club			1
' everyone has been watching every game for the last few months ' he says			0
' @entity4 may have more fans here in @entity15 than anywhere else			0
no one wanted the season to end as it did			0
when you ’re so close and it slips away from you like that it is so hard			0
' he texted ‘ animo ’ a kind of @entity144 ‘ chin - up ’ to a distraught @entity5 after the @entity146 game			0
' what more can you do in that situation ? ' he says			0
frozen out ? @entity8 has found it hard to cement a first team place at @entity151 he hopes there will be no need for similar messages of support after the @entity157 game tomorrow night			0
and when the tournament ends he wants to return to @entity4 and establish himself as a @entity160 starter alongside @entity5 or even at another @entity160 club if a loan spell becomes the only way of showing the class that made a @entity129 champion three years ago			0
it would be a shame if he did n’t make it in @entity11 ; with a name like @entity8 he has to have @entity171 roots after all ? ' the family came from @entity173 three or four generations back , ' he says			2
' and the first one who came to @entity15 , the first @entity8 , came by boat … from @entity4 of course			1

@entity8 plays with both @entity5 and @entity2 at @entity4
@entity5 and @entity2 face off in @entity11 vs @entity15 on thursday
