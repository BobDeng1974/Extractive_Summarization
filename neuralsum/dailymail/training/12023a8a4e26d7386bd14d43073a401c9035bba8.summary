published : 23:37 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 18 november 2013 at first glance , photographer @entity1 's series @entity2 seems to show a model wearing a series of delicate black and nude gowns , framed artistically by an oval picture frame			1
on closer inspection , though , the model is actually adorned in gowns that haqve been hand drawn onto the surface of a mirror			2
the model , @entity12 , stands perfectly aligned with the drawings , created by @entity14 , with simple hair and make - up by @entity17 and styling by @entity19 that allows the drawings to take center stage			2
the result is a photo spread that falls somewhere between high fashion and fantasy			0
@entity14 's illustrations create the appearance of different fabrics and textures , shadow and depth are added with shading and the dresses appear to be fitted perfectly to the body of the model			0
the dreamy portraits are a striking convergence of the mediums of fashion photography and fashion illustration			0
mirror , mirror : the model wears an ornate gown made of @entity46 markings on a mirror bejeweled : a gorgeous hand - drawn necklace adorns the model 's neck @entity51 : the mirror sketches fit better than any real dress could designer drawings : the model wore only nude underwear for this shoot full of gorgeous dresses draws the eye : the hair and make - up are simple , in contrast to the intricate detail of the dresses bejeweled : the model ' wears ' a drawing of a @entity68 earring dress ups : @entity14 's sketches create the folds and movement of a real garment			1
