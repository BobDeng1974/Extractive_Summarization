according to information from @entity46 's @entity54 , the condition is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma , including concussions and blows to the head not accompanied by obvious symptoms			2
@entity15 has been known to affect boxers since the 1920s , but in recent years , a protein associated with the illness has been showing up in posthumous brain scans of athletes from a wide range of disciplines			2

the brown areas are tau protein deposits , which are linked to head trauma and concussions risky practice : while soccer players do not usually tackle one another , it is standard practice in the sport to head the ball - something that @entity21 enjoyed doing patients suffering from @entity15 tend to be impulsive , forgetful , experience bouts of depression and can have suicidal thoughts			1
chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia			0

' we have seen other athletes in their 20s with this level of pathology , but they ’ve usually been football players			0
' according to a published study that surveyed amateur soccer players in their 30s , the more they headed the ball over the course of a year , the more likely they were to show signs of brain damage and inflammations in @entity161 tests			0
