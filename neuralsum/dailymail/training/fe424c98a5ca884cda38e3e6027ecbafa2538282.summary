by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 14 may 2013 our brains are wired to detect and process grammatical errors automatically without us even realising it , according to research from the @entity7			1
previous studies concluded that our brains behave this way , yet neuroscientists from @entity7 now have the evidence to back these claims up			1
during a study of @entity16 speakers aged between 18 and 30 , the scientists used electroencephalography ( @entity18 ) to record changes in brain activity during an event , which in this case were short sentences presented visually one word at a time			1
during the grammatical error study at the @entity7 , researchers tested how the participants ' brains responded to sentences that were either grammatically correct , or contained a grammatical error			1
they recorded these changes in brain activity using @entity18 sensors , pictured @entity18 ( @entity18 ) is the method of recording electrical activity using sensors placed on the scalp			1
a brain 's electrical charge is maintained by billions of neurons			2
these neurons are electrically charged by proteins that send ions across their membranes			2
ions of similar charge repel each other			2
as ions push away from each other they create a wave , like the one pictured			2
this process is known as volume conduction			0
when the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp , they can push or pull electrons on the metal			0
since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily , the difference in push or pull voltages between any two electrodes can be measured by a voltmeter			0
recording these voltages over time gives us the @entity18			1
this change in brain signals is known as the @entity72 ( @entity72 )			1
participants were given 280 experimental sentences , including some that were syntactically , grammatically , correct and others containing grammatical errors			1
for example , ' we drank @entity81 's brandy by the fire in the lobby ' and ' we drank @entity81 's by brandy the fire in the lobby			0
' a 50 millisecond audio tone was also played at some point in each sentence			0
this could be before or after a grammatical error , or at a random point during a grammatically correct sentence			1
according to lead researcher @entity95 , this method could show whether awareness was at work during the brain 's processing of the errors			1
' participants had to respond to the tone as quickly as they could , indicating if its pitch was low , medium or high			0
' the grammatical violations were fully visible to participants , but because they had to complete this extra task , they were often not consciously aware of the violations			2
@entity95 is a postdoctoral researcher at the @entity7			1
she recorded event - related brain potentials ( @entity110 ) as study participants were given sentences containing grammatical errors			1
in the majority of cases , the participants processed the errors without even realising it ' they would read the sentence and have to indicate if it was correct or incorrect			2
' if the tone was played immediately before the grammatical violation , they were more likely to say the sentence was correct even it was n't			2
' when tones appeared after grammatical errors , subjects detected 89 % of the errors			1
in cases where subjects correctly declared errors in sentences , the researchers found a @entity134 effect			1
the @entity134 effect is an @entity72 response in which the error is recognised and corrected automatically in order to make sense of the sentence			0
when the tones appeared before the grammatical errors , subjects detected only 51 % of them			1
co-author @entity143 said that when the tone was played before the event it created a blink in the participant 's attention			0
the key to conscious awareness , @entity152 continued , is based on whether or not a person can declare an error			0
and the tones disrupted participants ' ability to do this			0
however , even when the participants did not notice these errors , their brains responded to them , generating an early negative @entity72 response			1
these undetected errors also delayed participants ' reaction times to the tones			2
@entity95 said : ' even when you do n't pick up on a syntactic error your brain is still picking up on it			0
' there is a brain mechanism recognising it and reacting to it , processing it unconsciously so you understand it properly			0
@entity143 , who co-authored the @entity7 study looking into how our brains respond to grammatical errors , said that teaching strategies should be changed in light of the results			1
she added that children pick up grammar rules implicitly through daily interactions with parents or peers			0
@entity152 thinks that adults should be taught grammar in a similar way when learning a second language , to make the process easier ' while other aspects of language , such as semantics and phonology , can also be processed implicitly , the present data represent the first direct evidence that implicit mechanisms also play a role in the processing of syntax , the core computational component of language			0
' @entity152 said that the results mean it may be time to reconsider teaching strategies , especially how adults are taught a second language			1
children , she noted , often pick up grammar rules implicitly through routine daily interactions with parents or peers , simply hearing and processing new words and their usage before any formal instruction			0
she likened such learning to ' @entity219 ' - the nonsense poem introduced by @entity221 in 1871 in ' through the @entity222 , '			0
during this scene , @entity223 discovers a book in an unrecognisable language that turns out to be written inversely and readable in a mirror			0
for adults learning a second language , @entity152 said : ' teach grammatical rules implicitly , without any semantics at all , like with jabberwocky			2
get them to listen to jabberwocky , like a child does			0
' the @entity236 of the @entity237 supported the research and the study was published in the may 8 issue of the @entity241 .			0

researchers from the @entity7 recorded how the signals in our brains react to grammatical errors
results are the first time scientists have been able to prove this theory
