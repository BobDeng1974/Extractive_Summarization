by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 14:49 est , 4 march 2014 it 's @entity3 today when many children will be having fun in the kitchen , mixing and frying batter and enjoying the fruits of their labours			1
but this family activity does n't have to be limited to one day a year			2
@entity12 schoolboy @entity11 started cooking when he was nine after being inspired by watching his parents whip up meals from scratch			1
by the tender age of 12 , he was crowned @entity18 champion 2012 , beating 32 other contestants and impressing judges with his delicious dishes			1
while many children love baking cookies and fairy cakes , @entity11 says children 's culinary ventures do n't have to be limited to creating sweet treats			1
while making pancakes on @entity3 is a great place to start , @entity11 said there are a number of other dishes children can create with minimal fuss			1
one of them is his ' @entity50 ' recipe which he created after being inspired by the film @entity52			1
he said : ' i love making new recipes and this is one other children can do with their parents at home			1
i served them with salsa and they love and taste great			2
' @entity11 said one of his favourite things about cooking is watching people 's reactions when they taste his food			1
@entity68 , founder of @entity69 , said that getting children to help out in the kitchen is an excellent way to build their confidence in new skills and get them interested in healthy food			1
she told @entity77 : ' children are more likely to eat a dish or meal if they have had a hand in it , so let them help out in the kitchen even if it is only doing something small and not dangerous			2
allow them to explore the ingredients and learn from them			2
' like @entity11 , @entity68 said parents should n't feel limited to just baking with their little ones			1
do n't just do it on @entity3 : getting children cooking and baking all year round is a great way to help them learn a new skill and learn about healthy eating ( posed by models ) she recommends finding unusual fruit and vegetables at the supermarket and finding new ways to prepare and cook them to make healthy eating more appealing			1
she said : ' try not to always make the same thing and try and keep away from the very sweet things			2
@entity107 dishes are just as much fun to prepare and make as sweet biscuits , cakes and desserts , and of course much healthier to eat			2
' she also advises letting the child ' be creative in the kitchen and put their own stamp on the food '			2
she explained : ' this makes them happy and empowers them to eat and explore food further			0
' this was the case for @entity11 and now he hopes to be a full - time chef when he leaves school - watch out @entity127			1
