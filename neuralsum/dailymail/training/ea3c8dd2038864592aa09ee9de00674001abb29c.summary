by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 08:48 est , 3 september 2012 increasing numbers of highly skilled clinical staff are being employed on @entity5 - style ' zero - hours ' contracts , risking the health and safety of @entity9 patients , it was revealed today			1
the controversial deals bind staff to being on call , despite having no guarantees on hours , pay or some employment rights			1
@entity15 's , the world 's biggest fast - food chain , employs the majority of its 87,500 @entity20 staff on this basis , allowing them to call in workers at short notice at busy periods or not at all if it is quiet			1
anger : increasing numbers of clinical staff are being employed on zero hours contracts they only get paid for the hours they are there , meaning they are ' in work , but not always at work , ' experts say			1
the @entity9 has used this kind of contract to cover low - skilled jobs like cleaning , but now it is claimed the government 's controversial reforms are allowing more trusts to use them to cover frontline staff treating the public in hospitals and clinics			1
these include cardiac services , physiotherapy , psychiatric therapy , and hearing services			2
labour shadow health secretary @entity49 told @entity50 : ' i 'm calling on the government to halt the spread of zero - hours contracts in the @entity9 pending an urgent review into the potential risks to continuity of care and patient safety			1
' what is going on here is the unpicking of the fabric of the employment system of the @entity9 in @entity65			2
zero - hours contracts have previously operated safely within the @entity9			1
they suited some staff willing to trade a bit of uncertainty for extra pay			0
but it 's very different to extend these contracts into core delivery services			2
' it is the casualisation of our health service , turning parts of the @entity9 into a temping workforce			0
' the growing use of the contracts was a ' depressing symptom of the government 's drive to turn @entity65 's health service into a full - blown market , ' he added			2
big employer : the controversial contracts are used by @entity5 , allowing them to manage staffing levels critics fear that trusts could be left in a ' @entity95 situation ' , where they are unable to muster enough staff when some of these ' zero - hours ' staff fail to turn up for shifts because they are working elsewhere or put off the job because of their contract			1
@entity95 suffered humiliation this summer when on the eve of @entity104 it revealed it could not bring in enough staff , meaning thousands of soldiers were brought in to guard the @entity106			0
@entity107 : shadow health secretary @entity49 says he wants the contracts stopped @entity110 , who have highlighted the situation , say they are getting ' worrying feedback ' from their members working in the @entity9 about the issue			2
they say the situation will be made worse because @entity85 reforms will allow patients more choice about where they want to be treated			0
hospital trusts and private firms are turning to the contracts because they are competing for work , they say			0
a @entity110 spokesman says the situation means providers ' do not know how much work will be given , because it is supposed to be up to patients to decide which provider they choose			0
' yet in order to be approved as a provider , they must demonstrate they can operate with spare capacity so they can meet increasing patient demand should that happen			0
but rather than simply hire staff that might be needed , which is expensive , many providers are turning to zero - hours contracts			1
the whole thing is an unnecessary , untested experiment â€“ a nightmare			0
' trusts using these contracts include @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
trusts like @entity146 told the @entity50 that it allows them to have a ' pool of experienced staff that are able to help out at times of increased demand ' , while the @entity148 trust said it saved public money by reducing the need to use more expensive agency staff			0
a @entity158 spokesman told @entity159 : ' the use of bank staff in the @entity9 is nothing new and has nothing to do with the health reforms			1
@entity149 have always had the flexibility to employ staff on such contracts			0
' however , because the cost of employing these staff tends to be higher than the cost of permanent staff , the @entity9 should only use such contracts when it is the most appropriate use of its resources			2

using these deals staff are on call but only paid for the hours they work
@entity15 's employs the majority of its workers on this basis so they can bring in more *people* at peak times
contracts were for low - skilled @entity9 jobs but now include *cardiology* and physiotherapy staff
the @entity158 deny the claims are true
