lenticular clouds are stationary , lens - shaped formations which can appear at high altitudes			1
similar clouds also turned up over @entity25 yesterday – where they assumed a shape more like that of @entity29 ’s most famous spacecraft , the fictional @entity30			2
the clouds – scientific name altocumulus lenticularis – are a phenomenon seen in every country in the world where there are hills and moisture			2
to boldly glow : these red clouds over @entity25 , @entity18 , resemble @entity41 's @entity30 they are formed when a smooth , stable airflow strikes these hills and are sometimes found at extreme altitudes , composed of ice particles			1
just as a rock in a stream will form ripples downstream , a similar effect occurs in the air – with the clouds forming at the peaks of the waves			0
you ’re most likely to notice them in winter in the @entity56 , especially if you live to the west of hills			0
glider pilots use these waves in the air to achieve high altitudes			1
