commentary by by @entity1 born in comparative poverty in @entity3 , he became one of @entity6 's richest tycoons by transforming @entity7 from a sport for car enthusiasts into a global brand producing profits of more than £ 1billion a year			1
during that journey , he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £ 2.5billion for @entity16 a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by the @entity20 , and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of used cars with criminals , the fruits of his wealth have been sweet			1
they include a large yacht , racehorses , fabulous houses across @entity3 and in @entity30 , a private jet and even his own airport in @entity33			1
bribe charge : @entity7 boss @entity35 stands between his lawyers as he arrives in the regional court in in @entity38 , @entity39 with typical swagger , @entity35 always pays in cash , often peeling off 500 - euro notes from a wad			1
indeed , he has been known to carry $ 1million ( £ 600,000 ) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room by mistake			2
with his vast fortune , $ 1million is petty cash			0
of course , it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently accused in a @entity39 court of paying a £ 27million bribe to a banker to secure the sale of a stake in @entity7 to a company he favoured			1
now he faces @entity64 's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £ 1billion in taxes			1
for his part , @entity35 , an inveterate gambler , is unfazed			1
last night he told me : ' everything about my taxes is clear and straight , yet everyone is looking for a mystery			0
' in the tycoon 's view , @entity64 is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement			0
others , of course , may see matters differently			0
the story behind the @entity85 team 's allegation started in 1996 , when @entity35 , then 66 , was trying to raise £ 1billion by selling part of his @entity7 empire			1
during the negotiations , lawyers told him that his then wife , @entity90 , a statuesque @entity92 model he met during the @entity94 @entity93 in @entity95 , could n't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes because she was not domiciled in @entity6			1
life of luxury : @entity35 's yacht , @entity101 so , to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death , @entity35 legally transferred his wealth to a trust in @entity30 which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of herself and their two daughters			1
to guarantee that no inheritance taxes could be claimed by the @entity112 , @entity35 would have no control over the trust			2
also , for the tax avoidance to be watertight , he had to live for another seven years			0
the scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery			0
he survived but there was another hitch in 2008 : @entity90 decided to file for a divorce			0
suddenly , @entity35 faced a major dilemma			2
his lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the @entity30 trusts from @entity90 but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had created			0
so instead , he asked @entity90 to pay him what she thought ' fair '			0
@entity90 duly agreed to give her ex-husband £ 60 million a year for ten years			0
that crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by the @entity112 into @entity35 's private use of his company 's cars , plane and homes			1
it is believed that @entity134 , right , has paid £ 300 million to her ex-husband @entity35 , right , since their 2009 divorce in the revenue 's opinion , @entity35 should have paid more tax on the benefits			1
in due course , both sides agreed to settle for a payment of £ 10million			0
at the same time , @entity90 agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for having benefited from the trust , and she also paid the taxman £ 10million			0
but it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in @entity35 standing trial in @entity39 , charged with bribery			2
in 2002 , the then majority - owner of @entity7 , a @entity39 tv tycoon , became bankrupt			2
his shares were seized by a @entity39 bank which had loaned him the money for the original purchase			0
in a complicated case , the @entity39 authorities allege that @entity35 bribed the @entity39 banker controlling the shares to ensure that @entity7 was sold to a private equity group of @entity35 's choice			1
the prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the company , @entity35 would remain in charge of @entity7 and its commercial rights , broadcast payments and sponsorship deals			1
@entity35 , who once advised me : ' never threaten – just do it ! ' , admits making the payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue of whether he controlled his family trust in @entity30			2
having transformed himself from a second - hand car dealer into the owner of one of the world 's most popular sports , he admits he breaks rules – but not laws			0
controversially , he has said : ' first get on , then get rich , then get honest , ' and , ' in @entity7 , everyone cheats			2
the trick is not to get caught			0
' competitive to his core , with steel - tipped elbows , @entity35 – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win			1
' show me a good loser , ' he has said , ' and i 'll show you a loser			0
