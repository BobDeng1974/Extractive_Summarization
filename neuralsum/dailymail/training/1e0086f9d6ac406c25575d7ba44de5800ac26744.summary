by @entity0 a mother whose baby died by hanging herself with a blind cord has vowed to carry on campaigning - after her charity was targeted by online trolls			2
an inquest four months ago found @entity7 's 17 - month - old daughter @entity6 died after accidentally getting her neck caught in the beaded loop and strangling herself in @entity10			1
but now , the 22 - year - old is facing a stream of online comments blaming her for the death and calling her an ' unfit mother ' , after she started campaigning for a @entity18 - wide ban on window blind cords			1
tragic death : @entity21 ( left , with partner @entity22 ) was left devastated when her 17 - month - old daughter @entity6 ( centre ) died after she got her neck caught in a beaded loop and strangled herself miss @entity7 went public with her story to raise awareness of the dangers looped blind cords pose to children , but speaking out led to a stream of online comments blaming her for the death			1
writing on her @entity36 campaign page - which she started to fight for a @entity18 - wide ban on the cords - the @entity34 resident admitted the ill - informed remarks had left her feeling depressed			1
miss @entity7 said : ‘ i ’ve been criticised a lot about @entity36 , people telling me that banning blinds with cords is pointless and that it is my fault @entity6 died			2
‘ i ’ve been blamed and called an unfit parent , neglectful and that people like me should not “ breed ”			0
’ accidental : miss @entity21 had only left @entity6 alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord , slipped over and cut off her air supply but she added that she has tried to stay positive , saying : ‘ at first it broke me			1
i slipped into a deep depression and just wanted to be out of this world with my little girl			0
' i ’ve been blamed and called an unfit parent , neglectful and that people like me should not " breed " ' @entity7 ‘ at some point i decided to ignore the trolls			0
i realised that these people were in their few and 95 per cent of people have in fact been very kind and supportive			0
‘ i decided i wanted to make a difference and needed to do something , not just for my own sanity but for my little girl and for every child out there			0
‘ i will persevere , i wo n’t stop			0
i will carry on creating awareness and @entity36 will live on in the memory of my beautiful @entity6			0
i love you baby girl			2
’ only 17 months old : @entity6 died on the morning of june 27 last year - and it would have taken as little as seven seconds for her to lose consciousness in another post , miss @entity7 said : ‘ behind all of the campaigning is a grieving mummy , daddy and family			1
it ’s so sad others have to spoil it and make it harder , it still hurts and it always will			0
tribute : @entity6 's @entity36 was started in her honour ‘ i ’m just thankful we have so many more supporters than trolls - people who actually care and take the time to write lovely comments and share the campaign			2

miss @entity7 had only left @entity6 alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord , slipped over and tragically died			1
the blind cord had been in the house since she and partner @entity22 , a builder , moved in 18 months earlier - hidden behind the curtain where it had gone unnoticed			2
@entity6 - whose parents are expecting another baby girl in just over a month - is the 28th person known to have died in this way in @entity18 since 1999			1
the @entity36 campaign includes a @entity112 page and an online petition which could force a ban on window blind cords to be debated in @entity116 if it gathers 100,000 names			1
the appeal has only attracted more than 5,000 signatures in support so far , and the parents have become involved in the first ever @entity122			0
safety devices are sold with most blinds which include cleats to tie the cord to the wall , keeping it taut , and chain - break connectors which will pull apart when undue pressure is applied			0
but they rely on the person fitting the blinds to make sure they are applied correctly .			0
