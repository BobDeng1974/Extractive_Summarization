by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 11:17 est , 5 july 2012 under investigation : former @entity3 chief executive @entity2 was questioned yesterday the former chief of @entity3 was yesterday put under investigation over his alleged role in a wave of suicides by staff			1
@entity2 was head of the telecoms company when when more than 30 employees committed suicide in 2008 and 2009 , a decade after its privatisation			1
following a complaint from trade unions , he has now been accused of advocating management practices that were so tough they amounted to psychological harassment , his lawyer said yesterday			1
he was released under court surveillance on bail of 100,000 euros ( Â£ 80,000 ) after being questioned for four hours by two investigating magistrates			0
@entity2 stepped down as @entity3 ceo in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis			1
the company had suspended its restructuring plans the year before amid an outcry			2
yesterday he issued a statement in the prominent @entity32 national newspaper @entity31 proclaiming his innocence			0
' i forcefully reject the idea that ( restructuring ) plans vital to the survival of the company might have been the cause of human tragedies , ' he said			0
the former ceo added : ' t no point were these plans conceived and put in place by @entity3 directed against employees			0
' they were meant to save the company and its employees , and to open up new career paths in the new digital world			0
' @entity2 's lawyer , @entity50 , said his client had not been given a chance to explain himself fully			1
mr @entity50 said @entity2 sought to clarify the context of his actions by referring to tough economic conditions and pressure exerted by the government , a minority stakeholder			1
unions said harsh practices including forced moves and impossible performance targets were partly behind the rash of suicides			0
many of @entity3 's workers had protected status making it difficult to fire them			2
the company instead gave them meaningless jobs to force them out , driving some to suicide , unions said			2
@entity3 had countered by saying the suicide rate was no higher than in the general population			0
nevertheless , many of those who killed themselves left notes blaming work pressures , the @entity75 reported			1
yet the former ceo , who was succeeded by @entity80 , said after stepping down that he regretted not taking measures earlier than he had to boost staff morale at the company , which employs 100,000			2
in february 2010 , government labour inspectors wrote in a report on the suicides that @entity3 had ignored warnings from doctors about the mental health of certain employees			0
the report , seen by @entity92 , pointed to a restructuring plan that sought to reduce headcount by 22,000 and put 10,000 other workers in new positions as having a ' pathological effect ' on staff morale			2
' in this case , mr @entity2 is being accused of harassment against people that he never met , ' mr @entity50 said			1
' that is a stunning accusation			0
' if found guilty of harassment , @entity2 could face up to one year in prison and a 15,000 - euro fine			1
