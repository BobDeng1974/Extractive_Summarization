@entity3 - spaniel cross @entity1 bounded off across the field and started eating something , believed to be a cake laced with the drug , in the field while on walk with owner @entity16			1
ms @entity16 , 40 , thought nothing of it until her dog started to shake , look dazed and struggled to stand up			1
her partner @entity20 , 41 , rushed the six - year - old dog to the vets where he was described as being ' intoxicated '			1
he stopped shaking at the vets , but started to look more ' spaced - out ' , slowly leaning over and began to drift off			2
mr @entity20 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ' @entity1 had darted off because he saw something on the ground , which is n’t unusual , and ate it			1
' but about an hour or two later , when @entity16 brought him home he started looking very dazed , confused and could n’t walk			1
' he was really wobbly and when we put his food out for him he would n’t touch it , which is unusual			0
' at that stage we did n’t think that he was stoned , but on reflection , he was giving all the hallmarks of being a very stoned dog			2
' the vet was fairly convinced that he had taken some kind of drug and that he was stoned			1
' @entity1 was taken to @entity40 , in @entity41 , @entity26 , where he was seen by vet @entity42			1
mr @entity42 said : ' when i saw him first he walked into the consulting room fine , but he was indeed shaking like a leaf , it ’s no wonder they were worried			0
@entity1 started to shake , looked dazed and struggled to stand up after eating the drug ' i checked him over and he looked a bit flushed , with red gums			1
the most striking thing about the examination was his incredible low temperature - several degrees below normal , something only usually seen in severe shock			0
' but strangely he seemed fine , with no sign of shock			0
i even checked by using a second thermometer			0
his heart rate was also extremely slow			0
' it was beginning to dawn on me that this was a possible intoxication			0
the trouble is that we had no idea of how much he ’d had or of exactly what , although i strongly suspected marijuana , given the circumstances			0
' probably in some sort of sweet cake , hence the reason he was so keen to eat it			2
' mr @entity20 was given strict instructions to keep a close eye on @entity1 overnight but despite his condition getting better his mood worsened and he spiralled into depression			2
mr @entity20 said : ' @entity1 is usually a very happy dog , full of energy and friendly			1
but after he ’d eaten what ever it was that he ate he was very depressed that night			0
@entity20 rushed the dog to the vets after he started to look dazed			1
the dog has now been given a clean bill of health ' i think he was really confused and sad about why he was feeling that way , why he could n’t walk properly or why presumably he was feeling so giddy			2
' he was sad all night and even a little in the morning but eventually as it worked its way out of his system he was back to his normal , happy self			0
' a check - up at the vets the next day gave the dog a clean bill of health , but the dog 's owners are now urging others to keep an eye while walking their pets			0
marijuana is toxic to dogs and cats , and symptoms can be severe and life - threatening if not treated promptly .			0
