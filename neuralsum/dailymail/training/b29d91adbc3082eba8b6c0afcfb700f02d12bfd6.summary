judge @entity1 ' decision was severely criticised in today 's appeal ruling a mother and her 11 - year - old son were separated on the orders of a judge who refused to listen to their pleas to live together , an appeal ruling found today			1
three appeal judges said the mother was wrongly denied the hope of getting her son back by the behaviour of judge @entity1 in the family court in @entity16			1
judge @entity1 took the decision to break up the family forever on the basis of an out - of - date report by social workers			1
he refused to listen to crucial facts of the case - dismissing them as ‘ @entity27 detail ’			1
instead he decided to make a final judgement about the mother and son ’s future on the spot , at a court hearing that was only supposed to plot the future conduct of the case , the appeal judges found			1
judge @entity1 decided to break up the family ‘ within a matter of minutes ’ , dismissing the 11 - year - old ’s hopes of living with his mother			1
he wished the boy ‘ every good luck in the world but the @entity46 and the court has nothing to do with it			0
’ the appeal ruling published today contained severe condemnation of @entity52 ’ conduct of the case by three appeal judges : lady justice @entity55 , @entity56 and the most senior family judge , @entity59 sir @entity58			1
sir @entity58 said : ‘ it is unhappily all too apparent that no dispassionate observer of the proceedings could think that justice was done , let alone that it was seen to be done			0
’ he added that ‘ such a ruthlessly truncated process as the judge adopted here was fundamentally unprincipled and unfair			2
’ lady justice @entity55 said that @entity52 ’ behaviour ‘ was not only unfair to the mother but contrary to the interests of the children with whom he was concerned			2
’ lord @entity56 added that justice could not be done ‘ when a judge has apparently made up his mind before hearing argument or evidence			2
‘ a closed mind is incompatible with the administration of justice , ’ @entity80 said			0
the family that came before @entity52 in the brief hearing in @entity16 last august were the mother and her three children who had been taken into state care at the end of 2012			2
lawyers , social workers and grandparents had agreed that two of the children , aged 14 and 10 , would go to live with their grandparents			0
but the 11 - year - old wanted desperately to live with his mother			1
the @entity99 judgement said that the boy was academically capable and ‘ overachieving ’ at school			0
but in less than two years he had gone through 14 different placements with foster parents and his life was one of ‘ continued instability , distress and fervent desire to go home			0
’ at one stage social workers had sent him to live with his father , a drug dealer , where the boy complained of ill treatment			0
he was sent back to the father , who was later charged with assaulting the boy and was in prison awaiting trial at the time of the appeal hearing last month			2
social workers had told the mother they would allow new drug tests to check her claims that she had turned her life around , and lawyers agreed the court should consider sending the boy back to her			2
three appeal judges said the mother was wrongly denied the hope of getting her son back by the behaviour of judge @entity1 in the family court in @entity16 ( pictured ) but judge @entity1 took a different view			1
the appeal judges said that at the august case management hearing intended to plan future hearings , ‘ within a matter of minutes the judge had made abundantly clear , in trenchant terms , his determination to conclude the case there and then by making final care orders			1
‘ all the parties crumbled under the judge ’s caustically expressed views , and as a consequence were unable to explain to the judge that the situation was more complicated			0
’ they added that at one stage @entity52 said the mother looked ‘ upset and bewildered ’			0
the appeal judges observed : ‘ it is hard to see how she could have looked otherwise			0
’ judge @entity1 made care orders placing all three children under the care of @entity16 social workers despite the detailed and different plans that had been made for them			1
the appeal judges set the decision aside and ordered the case should be taken over by a different judge			1
sir @entity58 said : ‘ a parent facing the removal of their child must be allowed to put their case to the court , however seemingly forlorn			0
it is one of the oldest principles of our law – it goes back over 400 years – that no - one is to be condemned unheard			2
’ he added that the mother had a right to question social workers in court			0
sir @entity58 said that while requirements that family cases involving the fate of children should take no more than 26 weeks in court were important , ‘ robustness can not trump fairness			0
