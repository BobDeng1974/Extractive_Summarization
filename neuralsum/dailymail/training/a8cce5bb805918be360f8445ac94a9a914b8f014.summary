as @entity1 braces itself for downpours this winter , one council has come up with an ingenious solution to reducing the risk to homes from flooding - building them on stilts			1
houses in a @entity10 town are to be built on poles measuring three metres high , in a @entity13 - inspired scheme to keep them safe away from flood waters			1
it is thought to be the first time the scheme will be used in the @entity1			2
an image of the houses on stilts that are to built in @entity10 to keep people 's homes away from flood waters @entity24 , which has designed the complex , has produced images of what the marina will look like the homes , which are part of a Â£ 150 million housing scheme , were designed by @entity32 firm @entity24 for the @entity10 peninsula , where flooding is a particular concern			1
@entity36 , 45 , director of @entity24 , said : ' we designed these innovative houses on stilts so they could survive in an obvious flood zone			0
' the whole scheme was inspired by @entity13 solution to flooding - i do n't think this has been tried yet in @entity45			2
' the scheme at @entity47 in @entity48 was given planning approval by @entity50 last week			0
the homes are to be built on stilts on the flood plain and are inspired by a @entity13 design to cope with flooding the scheme will be built around @entity47 in @entity10 to avoid houses on the flood plain being flooded mrs @entity36 said the designs had been welcomed by the council and public and they were keen to seem more similar homes built in the area			1
' they 're essentially flat - pack buildings which can be put up quickly and can cope with any kind of flood - they can be raised as high as you 'd like quite easily , ' she added			0
experts predict the sea level in @entity10 will rise 37cm by the year 2080 , making coastal flooding more likely			0
earlier this year vast areas of the @entity71 were left underwater by torrential rain and floods in february cars were left floating in flood waters near @entity71 during the wettest ever winter for the @entity1 council planners will be hoping to avoid what happened in @entity71 last winter when vast swathes of the south west were left submerged when the country was battered by torrential rain			1
villages in the @entity71 were completely cut off by the flood waters , and the @entity83 was forced to bring in dredgers and pumps to remove some of the excess water			2
the @entity87 said last winter was the wettest on record			0
two weeks ' worth of rainfall are expected to hit the @entity1 on tuesday night as @entity91 hits the country .			0

inspired by @entity13 scheme , houses on flood plain will be built on stilts
homes will be built on poles three metres high to lift them from flood waters
designs approved by @entity10 council and will be the first scheme in @entity45
planners hoping to avoid *problems* of last winter , *dubbed* @entity1 's wettest ever
designers say homes are *versatile* and can be raised as high as necessary
