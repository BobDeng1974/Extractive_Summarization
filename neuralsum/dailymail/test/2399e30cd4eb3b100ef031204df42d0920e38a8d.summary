on the eve of the @entity3 season , @entity0 has finally secured the professional cricket contract he has been striving for over the past decade			1
only it is not with one of the 18 teams that make up our domestic game			2
for @entity10 , a 25 - year - old former @entity13 grammar school pupil who suffered habitual rejection in his attempts to breakthrough into the @entity17 system , has an amazing story to tell , after forging an unlikely first - class career in @entity20			1
it has been an extraordinary journey for @entity0 from a second @entity23 debut for @entity24 at 15 to his recent status as the first @entity17 to hit a @entity26 hundred since @entity28 for @entity29 in 1978			1
that feat was accomplished in @entity32 's final match of the 2014 - 15 season , a victory over @entity20 at the @entity35			1
@entity0 during his @entity24 career ( left ) and as a youngster for @entity38 under 11s where he scored his first hundred ( right ) when he emigrated to @entity41 18 months ago , he admits his desire for a shot at the top level had regressed into an ' unrealistic dream '			1
that it became a reality was due to polar opposite experiences to the ones he endured over here			0
every time he was faced with a door it opened whereas previously they had slammed in his face			0
@entity24 , @entity55 and @entity56 all knocked him back			0
a stunning first season down under – in which he finished third top scorer in @entity32 's grade competition – was followed by a state second xi debut last october			1
the following month he struck 140 out of 297 all out in the first innings of a game against @entity63			0
it put him in the frame for higher honours when the @entity26 season reopened post-big bash and a new year injury to @entity20 batsman @entity70 gave him his chance			1
on february 7 he pulled on the maroon cap for the first time			0
@entity74 dismissed him for a second - ball duck but @entity32 – showing numerous changes in the wake of @entity79 's removal as coach – crushed eventual champions @entity82 by an innings			1
the following week @entity0 hit 58 and @entity29 were defeated in @entity84 by a similar scoreline			1
two matches , two victories ; the @entity88 had hit the jackpot			2
@entity32 were not going to change a winning side and that very fact secured his future			1
matches 5 innings 8 not outs 0 runs 310 highest innings score 118 batting average 38.75 balls faced 809 batting strike rate 38.31 100s 1 50s 1 4s 37 6s 0 ' the system over here guarantees you a minimum contract if you play three state games , ' @entity0 explained to @entity102			1
' @entity103 upgrade you to a 12 - month deal which is about $ 60,000 ( £ 30,000 ) , so after three games i told work i was leaving			2
i knew i was going to be paid well and the match payments on top are good at just over $ 4,500 ( £ 2300 )			0
' @entity0 immediately gave up his early morning job for @entity111 at @entity112 , co-ordinating their aircraft loads out on the ramps in sweltering heat			2
a fortnight later , in his fifth appearance for @entity32 , he struck 118 on his adopted home ground			2
the celebratory removal of his helmet and glance to the heavens at reaching three figures an acknowledgement of his late @entity126 grandfather @entity125 , who while not a cricket aficionado had witnessed his lowest ebb six years earlier when he made 163 for @entity24 seconds against @entity130			0
' i am not really an extrovert , i keep my emotions fairly intact but what happened when i was released from @entity24 came back to me			0
a week after basically being told that i was n't good enough my granddad came to watch and it was great afterwards listening to him talk about how i 'd played from his non-cricket perspective , ' @entity0 explained			1
' he passed away last year and so when i got to 100 i looked up and thought about him			2
i knew how proud he would have been			0
to me , scoring a first - class hundred in @entity20 is quite something but he taught me a lot about life , and i have to say i was a lot more nervous when i stood up to speak at his funeral than i was when i was on 97			1
' although raised in @entity24 , @entity0 was born in @entity146 and @entity147 , arguably the greatest @entity144 batsman of them all , would have doffed his cap at the price he places on his wicket			2
according to @entity0 , a combination of leaving outside off - stump and playing the ball late is his modus operandi			1
' the one thing i have learned over here is that the best time to bat is in the second half of the day , so getting through the first half has been important			0
then i have cashed in			0
' @entity0 's rise is all the more remarkable given that the three counties in his first incarnation as a cricketer were at least as interested in his off - spin ( he has not bowled this past winter due to a labral tear in his shoulder )			1
at @entity168 , it meant the presence of @entity170 blocked his path			0
although the three @entity172 and two @entity173 in a @entity24 side that made consecutive @entity176 finals days in 2008 and 2009 , when he held two summer contracts , were probably more to blame for his lack of opportunities			0
' the club had other priorities , there was little focus on the second xi , ' he says			0
in contrast , his performances were catching the eyes of @entity187 and @entity189 - state coach and convenor of selectors respectively - not long after @entity20 @entity176 international @entity192 , with whom a friendship developed during a previous three - year stint in @entity32 grade cricket , lured him to @entity196			1
naturally , there is a tinge of bitterness that his break has come on the other side of the globe : ' i just feel that you ca n't decide someone 's career at the age of 19			2
different people develop at different rates			0
look at @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
those four all hit their prime in their late twenties			0
' not that he completely rules out a return : ' i do n't want to close any doors			2
i am open to anything and at the end of the day cricket is a very short career in the grad scheme of things			0
' but for now he is running with the @entity32 as @entity17 cricket 's unsung export .			1

@entity0 fulfilled an ' unrealistic dream ' to become a first - class cricketer
the 25 - year - old was rejected *consistently* by teams in the @entity17 system
@entity0 *enjoyed* a *successful* first season in @entity20 with @entity32
he is the first @entity17 to hit a @entity26 hundred since 1978
the @entity242 grammar school pupil did n't rule out a return to @entity244
