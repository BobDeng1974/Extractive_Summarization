she was just eight when she first attended the @entity2 service			0
the then princess @entity3 was photographed in 1935 at @entity4 in her smart bonnet and buttoned - up coat			1
it would be another 18 years before her coronation			0
eighty years on , the @entity3 yesterday gave out @entity10 coins in the pre-easter tradition			1
resplendent in a turquoise coat by @entity13 and matching hat , the @entity3 was all smiles as she arrived at @entity16 for the traditional ceremony			1
eighty years ago : the then princess @entity3 was pictured in @entity4 at the service in 1935 handing out alms : the @entity3 presents a lady with the two @entity21 at @entity16 joined by the @entity22 , @entity3 was there to present ' alms ' to 89 women and 89 men , among them @entity28 veteran , @entity27			1
' it was just quick			0
i 'm not very good at hearing , ' said mr @entity27 , 91 , after the ceremony			2
' she did say something but i 'm not sure what it were			0
' @entity3 , who had arrived on the @entity37 , was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag - waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers			1
@entity44 at the church door by @entity46 , the @entity47 , and the local @entity48 , @entity49 , her majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service			2
after the hour - long service , the @entity3 posed for pictures with the @entity55 , who had lined the cathedral 's aisles during the ceremony			1
the royal party then left for a reception at @entity62 as the recipients emerged into the sunshine , all pleased with their royal acknowledgement			0
@entity66 , 72 , said : ' it was brilliant , absolutely wonderful			0
when i got here the atmosphere was tremendous			0
' the @entity70 is one of the @entity73 's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins			0
this year , the @entity79 contains a £ 5 coin , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of @entity83 and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the @entity86			0
custom : monarchs have been presenting @entity10 since 1210 and @entity89 commemorative : the red and white bags contain commemorative coins , this year featuring @entity83 thank you : a gentleman looks pleased as he receives his commemorative coins from the queen bodyguard : the queen was accompanied by the @entity55 who carried in the purses signing up : the @entity3 signed the visitor 's book at @entity16 before she left tradition : the @entity3 and prince @entity22 were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers historically , this sum of £ 5.50 in the @entity79 is made up of £ 3 for clothing , £ 1.50 in lieu of provisions and £ 1 for the redemption of the @entity112 's gown			1
the @entity113 contains uniquely minted @entity10 , which , unlike coins in general circulation , bear the portrait of the queen produced by @entity118 at the start of her reign			2
@entity118 , a sculptor , designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the @entity73 and some @entity124 countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968			0
the portrait of the @entity3 wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation 's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years			2
the @entity10 is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment @entity137 gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before @entity140			1
warm welcome : the queen is greeted at @entity16 ahead of the traditional @entity70 @entity143 : @entity3 , looking wonderful in turquoise , arrived in the state @entity146 with the @entity22 @entity147 : the @entity22 was on jolly form as he arrived for the service busy week : the @entity3 will also appear at church in @entity151 on @entity152 meeting : the @entity3 speaks to the @entity153 and @entity48 ahead of the @entity70 in an echo of the @entity156 , mediaeval and @entity157 monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service			1
unlike the nosegay , which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell , that custom failed to survive the 18th century			0
the first monarch to take part in a maundy thursday service was @entity89 , of @entity168 and @entity170 fame , who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in @entity175 in 1210			1
@entity89 was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in @entity178 in 1213			2
@entity89 's grandson @entity179 , the king known to posterity as ' the @entity181 ' , was the first to confine the tradition to @entity183 alone , which , until his reign , could be conducted on any day of the year			1
recipient : one of the men receiving @entity10 clutches his ticket as he arrives for the service enthusiastic : a little girl waves as the @entity3 's @entity146 pulls up outside the @entity16 patriotic : crowds of people waited outside the @entity16 , many clutching @entity193 turn out : a lady keeps her @entity193 tucked under her arm as she waits to see the queen long wait : many of the well - wishers outside the @entity16 had waited there for hours by 1363 and @entity200 , the tradition had evolved into a ceremony that is still recognisable today , with monarchs handing out money equivalent to their age in years			1
the ceremony was little changed by the dawn of the @entity208 period , although rulers could - and did - increase the number of beggars involved to show their religious devotion and humility			0
none took it more seriously than @entity216 - who in 1556 washed the feet of 41 ' poor women ' and spent the entire ceremony on her knees			2
later monarchs were less keen on the service , with some , among them @entity224 , rarely bothering to take part			0
@entity226 , anxious to curry favour with his subjects following the restoration , took part in the ceremony without fail , including during the plague years			0
originator : the custom originated with @entity89 , shown here signing the @entity168 in june 1209 @entity234 : the 800 - year - old tradition used to involve washing beggars ' feet - hence the nosegay smell : the scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people all smiles : @entity3 , who has only missed the ceremony four times , was all smiles as she arrived schoolchildren : the queen was also introduced to a group of schoolchildren outside the cathedral although today 's ceremony takes place in a different location each year , queen @entity251 insisted on doing it at @entity4 - a custom that remained in place until the @entity3 took the throne in 1952			1
the @entity3 has taken part in the @entity70 in all but four years of her reign , including in 1954 when she was away touring the @entity124			2
she was also forced to pull out in 1960 thanks to the imminent birth of prince @entity263 , again in 1964 for the birth of @entity265 and in 1970 due to a tour of @entity267			0
dapper : the 93 - year - old @entity22 cut a dapper figure in his tailored suit bodyguards : the @entity3 was flanked by members of @entity89 's bodyguard of the @entity55 long history : the @entity55 have been part of @entity73 life since 1485 and are the @entity73 's oldest military body on her way : after the ceremony , the @entity3 was driven away for a lunch at @entity62 busy : the scene outside @entity16 ahead of the queen and prince @entity22 's arrival			1

the @entity3 has distributed the traditional @entity10 in @entity16
two bags of coins were presented to 89 men and 89 women during service
one was brave d - day veteran , 91 - year - old @entity27
her majesty arrived in the city on the @entity37 with prince @entity22
@entity10 tradition dates back to 1210 and the *infamous* @entity89
@entity89 , who appears in @entity170 , was also forced to sign the @entity168
royals were once required to wash the feet of beggars during the service
only the nosegay , intended to hide the smell , still survives of that part
