a married couple were paid £ 120,000 for four months hospital work just weeks after receiving £ 1million in taxpayer - funded redundancy payouts from the @entity4 , it was revealed today			1
@entity5 and @entity6 are at the centre of a national row over the revolving door of highly - paid administrators handed golden goodbyes before walking straight into another role			1
the managers earned £ 120,000 between them while in temporary management posts at hospitals in @entity17 , @entity18			2
but it has emerged that just two months before starting in the city , they had received payments totalling £ 1million after their previous health service jobs in the @entity24 were abolished			2
critics today called the salaries an ' outrageous example of the ' revolving - door ' culture in the @entity4 ' while a @entity17 mp said it was ' entirely wrong '			1
new figures show that in just eight months the number of managers who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300			0
this latest case involving married mr @entity5 and ms @entity6 came to work at @entity17 ' hospital trusts in june last 2013 after their previous roles , as chief executives at primary care trusts , disappeared due to @entity4 reforms in april last year			1
back in work : the married couple were taken on by the @entity38 trust after benefiting from a @entity4 reshuffle bosses had previously refused to say how much the couple had been paid while working for the trust as interim chief executive and recovery director			2
but , it had been revealed that mr @entity5 received £ 70,000 , including pension entitlements , and ms @entity6 £ 50,000			1
both worked at @entity17 hospitals between june and october last year			0
previously it has been revealed that ms @entity6 was paid more than £ 605,000 in redundancy from her top job at @entity72 of @entity73			2
mr @entity5 received more than £ 345,000 when @entity74 of @entity73 was wound up			0
the pair came under criticism last years when news of their large redundancy packages came to light , critics said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go			0
on an online forum for an @entity4 trade publication , one critic at the time posted : ' surely a relevant question is how come two former chief executives , effectively @entity5 and mrs @entity89 and @entity90 can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the @entity4 on mega high salaries			1
' there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing , but the case sparked national controversy when details first emerged last year - and the latest revelation has prompted further anger			0
@entity101 , political director at the @entity102 , said : ' this is yet another outrageous example of the ' revolving door ' culture in the @entity4 , which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay - offs and then again in the form of new salaries			1
' this is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply can not afford in the public sector , particularly at a time when hard - pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet			0
' last month the government vowed to recoup similar ' golden goodbyes ' paid to public sector workers earning more than £ 100,000 who return to the same part of the public sector within 12 nonths of taking redundancy			2
health secretary @entity128 argues the @entity4 reforms have saved £ 1.5billion a year , despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service @entity133 , mp for @entity134 , said : ' we already know about the scandalous sum that this couple were paid from @entity4 budgets in redundancy , then came back into the @entity4 in similar positions , earning good salaries as well			1
' that 's entirely wrong and people will be rightly outraged at a time when the pressure on these budgets is huge			0
' he said the situation ' must never be allowed to happen again ' and he was glad the @entity120 was legislating to prevent it			0
a spokesman for @entity38 said the couple were paid in line with the roles they were fulfilling .			0
