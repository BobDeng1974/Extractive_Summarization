by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 refers to the void between @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 defeat against @entity6 on june 19 and thursday 's squad announcement as ‘ @entity9 depression ’			1
the rest of the country , those poor souls who watched as @entity5 were knocked out before 12 teams had even played their second group game , were diagnosed at the same time			1
thursday was billed as ‘ @entity16 ’ at which the head coach explained why the @entity19 striker has succeeded @entity20 as captain			1
upbeat : @entity5 manager @entity2 ready for @entity23 qualification bid good for @entity24 , who has never made any secret of his desire to lead from the front , but there are more pressing matters to address			1
@entity2 declared : ‘ do n’t try to make me out to be some complete fool who , after getting knocked out in the first round of the @entity33 , says we are as good as the team who won it			1
’ if only he had been this spiky when the writing was on the wall at the @entity33 after @entity42 ’s 50th - minute header sealed a 2 - 1 victory for @entity44 in @entity45			0
boost : striker @entity24 has been handed the captain 's armband @entity2 must raise his game			1
he claims to have an identity in mind , a plan to play just like @entity52 — or better — as he starts out on the lengthy qualification campaign towards @entity23			1
he has reconstructed the squad , rightly bringing in @entity55 after the defender ’s outstanding start to his career with @entity59			0
‘ i spoke to @entity60 to ask him if it was too early and he said “ no , take him ” , ’ said @entity2			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are the other newbies in the group ahead of next wednesday ’s friendly with @entity68 at @entity69 and the @entity23 qualifier against @entity71 on september 8			0
‘ @entity52 have very good players and they started with these young players , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ @entity74 at 18 was n’t the player he is today and @entity76 was n’t			0
if we work hard and develop our players there is nothing to stop us producing these type of players and playing the same sort of football			0
’ lift : @entity85 's @entity64 has been called up to @entity5 squad by @entity2 so , now that @entity52 are champions of the world , we are going to play like them			1
it was inevitable , but we had to hear it from @entity2 to be certain			2
when @entity5 lost 1 - 0 to @entity52 in their own back yard last november , @entity93 had no fewer than 125 touches of the ball in midfield			2
over to you , @entity64			0
with @entity23 qualifiers against @entity71 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 over the next 18 months , @entity2 has time to convince a sceptical audience			1
‘ the qualifying group looks relatively easy so we can only hope that the chance to play in those qualifiers , plus getting games in club football , will in two years make them better players , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i am not blaming any of the clubs for sometimes not using these players			0
the 19 or 20 - year - old with great potential is having to fight competition from a 27 - year - old @entity117 or @entity118 international with 75 caps			0
‘ they may even develop some leadership qualities			0
you do n’t develop them without playing			0
blueprint for success : @entity5 want to copy world champions @entity52 ‘ if working with a younger team with potential costs us leaders , i ca n’t wave the magic wand and bring back a leader in defence , with one or two in midfield and up front			1
‘ i believe in the squad and i think they are going to be good enough			0
in 2016 we will see a good @entity5 team and i am entitled to believe that			2
’ let ’s hold @entity2 to this because no - one can sit through another lame @entity5 performance at a major tournament			1
he retains the full support of the @entity145 and maintains that he never came close to resigning after @entity5 finished bottom of @entity147 at the @entity33 with a single point			2
he said : ‘ when you have the backing of your employers and you have a contract and you have the backing of the people you are working with i do n’t see any reason not to carry on			0
’ to @entity2 ’s credit , he takes full responsibility for the failings of the national team in @entity117			2
‘ i accept all of those things , ’ he added			0
next week , in front of around 50,000 @entity5 fans , @entity2 must lift the mood of the nation with a bracing performance against @entity68			1
‘ i ca n’t expect people to shrug it off , but i ’m hoping it wo n’t be too evident that the apathy exists , ’ he added			0
‘ i am hoping the public gets behind the team because the team needs them			0
‘ we have to get on the field , put this shirt on and play well			2
i want them to think “ this team is worth following ”			0
’ as @entity2 knows , it has been a long time since anybody has been able to say that .			1
