leisure time : @entity1 , who was behind a £ 300,000 cannabis factory in @entity3 a builder converted a newly - built house into a £ 300,000 cannabis factory - after council planners told him he could only use it as a ' leisure facility			1
' @entity1 , 43 , wanted to build the three - bedroomed detached home at the back of his own £ 200,000 semi-detached house in @entity3 - but had been refused planning permission three times			1
finally , inspectors agreed he could build the property - but only after he promised he would only use the upper floors for ' leisure purposes ' , including a playroom for a billiard table and another for a model railway			1
yet after construction boss @entity1 finished his project , police received a tip - off about the nature of the property 's ' leisure facilities			1
' during a raid in may last year officers opened the roller shutters of the double garage - and were faced with a plaster board wall behind which they could hear fans whirring away			1
they then discovered 600 marijuana plant , being grown in 3,000 pots across all the three floors of the property			0
they also found a sophisticated hydroponic irrigation system complete with extraction ducts and discovered @entity1 had also rigged the electricity supply at his own home to steal £ 20,000 worth of power to supply light , water and air filtration			2
today @entity1 , from @entity3 , @entity47 , is starting three years in jail after he was convicted of producing cannabis following a 12 - day trial			1
boarded up : @entity1 blacked out the windows and boarded up the doors to keep his facilities secret one of his tenants @entity55 , 44 , of @entity56 was jailed for two and a half years for cannabis production			1
after the case a neighbour , who asked not be named , said : ' @entity61 planners may have told @entity1 he could only use the property for leisure purposes but obviously his idea of leisure purposes was far from their minds when they let him build it			1
also jailed : @entity68 must serve two and a half years ' the reality was @entity1 was pretty cross with the council when it refused him permission and we would n't be surprised if he finished the building off with a view to using it as a custom - built cannabis farm			1
' he had already started building the house when he was found out , and ordered to submit planning permission but the dispute went on for years and must have cost him a considerable a fortune			1
' maybe he thought growing cannabis was a way of getting back some of his money			0
' @entity1 who is company secretary of @entity85 in @entity56 and owns up to seven properties hit trouble in february 2007 , when he was caught trying to build an eighth house on half an acre of land behind his family home without the right permissions			1
over a two year period officials at @entity3 with @entity61 repeatedly refused planning permission for the property saying it would have a ' dominant , overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings , to the detriment of residential amenity			1
' a report said the proposal would be ' out of character with adjacent properties and the surrounding area in general			0
' but in january 2010 @entity1 applied again this time saying the detached property would now be a double garage and games room and offered drawings showing a ' playroom ' and ' model railway room ' as well as office space and a utility room			1
the following the march officials said they would only grant permission for the property to be completed on condition it would not be used as ' habitable accommodation			2
' he later completed the house and even showed it off on his company website			2
another neighbour said : ' the property was built about three years ago , and it is quite an eyesore and nobody likes it			2
' but we had no indication that it was a cannabis farm , we never smelt anything and you could n't tell it was lit up because the windows were whitewashed			0
' out of character : the ' cannabis house ' was hidden behind @entity1 's own house what officers might have expected to find : @entity1 told planning officers the upstairs would be used for projects such as a model railway the neighbour added : ' there was nothing suspicious about it either , no suspicion coming and goings and i kept a pretty good eye on it			1
i would n't say i was shocked when i found out what was going on - more surprised i 'd say - but not surprised when i found out it was him			2
' there were two fake garage doors at the front and behind that was a breeze block			0
the windows on the front were all white washed so you could never see in			0
it took about two days for the police to bring out all the plants			2
' we were told there were 600 cannabis plants but there must have been about 3,000 plant pots which in the end were given to the local garden centre			0
' the plants were between 6ft and 9ft high and had been being cropped			0
he must have had a lot of heaters in there too			0
' he must have put ducts in there that took out the smell so we could never smell anything because it went out the other way			0
even when we were sat out in summer we could n't smell anything			0
' mr @entity1 is a well known man around here because of his building background and he owns a lot of houses			2
' i always saw him in his overalls and driving a van			0
he 's a real @entity186			0
' @entity1 - @entity1 's @entity85 company showcased the house as a residential new build last september @entity1 was caught in a row after claims electricity powering seven houses he built were illegally connected			1
he and @entity55 both denied drugs charges at @entity194			0
a spokesman for the @entity196 said : ' in his back garden , @entity1 had built a three - bedroom property , albeit the planning permission was limited to a storage structure			1
' when the police conducted a raid at the property , they found that it was being used as a cannabis factory , with lights and fans and extraction ducting			2
' the electricity for the property was being abstracted from @entity1 's own house , with a cable running from his house and underground to the property in the rear garden			2
' det insp @entity217 from @entity218 said : ' this was a very large and significant cannabis set - up and i hope this result will reduce the supply of drugs in the local area			0
' cannabis brings upset and misery to our communities and we are determined to work with local residents to tackle the issue			0
i urge local residents to contact us with any information or concerns about cannabis in their community			0
