men and women who trap their partners in a cycle of emotional cruelty would be prosecuted and jailed under tough new laws proposed by ministers			0
in a dramatic shake - up , home secretary @entity7 today launched a consultation on creating a specific criminal offence of domestic abuse			1
police and prosecutors would be expected to take action against those who trap their partners in a ‘ living hell ’ through a campaign of psychological and financial control			1
at the moment , domestic abuse is widely taken to refer to acts of physical violence , and usually prosecuted under charges including assault , battery and actual bodily harm			1
controlling , threatening and intimidating behaviour can be covered by stalking and harassment legislation , but this is difficult to prosecute when it applies to intimate relationships , such as a husband and wife who live together			0
mrs may believes it does not properly protect victims who suffer ‘ terrible ’ non-violent harm , including coercive , threatening or intimidating behaviour , often for years , at the hands of so - called loved ones			1
research has shown that 30 per cent – or 5million – women and 16 per cent of men , around 2.5million , will experience domestic abuse during their lives			1
campaigners who work to tackle domestic abuse welcomed the proposals , which would carry a maximum prison sentence of five years			1
@entity58 , chief executive of women ’s aid , said : ‘ this is a vital step forward for victims of domestic violence			2
‘ in our experience of working with survivors , coercive , controlling behaviour is at the heart of the most dangerous abuse			2
’ she said changes would ‘ give victims greater confidence to speak out sooner , and perpetrators of domestic violence are identified and dealt with more swiftly and effectively			2
’ @entity74 , of the @entity75 , which campaigns for vulnerable women , said : ‘ psychological abuse , coercive control and patterns of abuse must be criminalised to ensure that the definition of domestic violence is enforceable in law			1
it will send out a clear message that this type of violence will not be tolerated			0
’ mrs may said : ‘ the government is clear that abuse is not just physical			2
it is an appalling crime			0
victims who are subjected to a living hell by their partners must have the confidence to come forward			1
‘ it is the worst possible violation of the trust that those in close relationships place in one another			0
it shatters the lives of its victims and , in some cases , leads to tragic and untimely deaths			0
’ a @entity103 spokesman said : ‘ this is not about a couple having a row with each other on an evening			0
it is about people whose lives are being controlled , who suffer a systematic pattern of intimidation and threats			0
‘ a person might not be beaten up but they might still be living with an abusive partner who wo n’t allow them to leave the house or speak to their friends which means they are living in fear			0
’ last year , 269,700 instances of domestic abuse were investigated by police , according to a @entity103 consultation document			1
last year , police received reports of 270,000 instances of domestic abuse according to @entity103 figures of these , around 96,000 – one in three – were assaults which involved an injury			1
some 77 women were murdered by partners or ex-partners in 2013			0
prosecutions for domestic violence in @entity139 nearly tripled from 35,000 in 2005 to 103,000 last year , and the conviction rate increased from 46 per cent to 74 per cent			2
but the government is still concerned that the police and other agencies are not treating the problem seriously enough			0
a report by @entity146 ( @entity146 ) earlier this year found thousands of domestic violence victims were being ‘ failed ’ by police forces across @entity149 and @entity150			2
poor attitudes , ineffective training and inadequate evidence - gathering were all heavily criticised by the watchdog , which called for an urgent shake - up of the response to domestic abuse			1
the consultation , which will last eight weeks , said : ‘ put simply , police officers failed to see domestic abuse as a serious crime			1
’ last year , ministers broadened the definition of domestic abuse as ‘ any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling , coercive or threatening behaviour , violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality ’			1
it will say this can encompass ‘ psychological , physical , sexual , financial and emotional ’ control			0
the government has also introduced ‘ @entity181 ’ , named after a woman who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009 , which allows the police to disclose information about previous violent offending by a partner			0
and the @entity103 brought in measures to force domestic abusers to leave their homes for up to 28 days to allow their partners the chance to seek help .			0

home secretary @entity7 may considering a new offence of ' domestic abuse '
the law would cover violence in the home *punished* by five years in prison
mrs may wants to provide hope to those victims caught in a ' living hell '
