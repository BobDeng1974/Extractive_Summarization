in a weekend where the rest of last season 's top four - @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity6 - all dropped points , @entity1 fans could be forgiven for a bit of crowing			1
@entity11 's hat - trick inspired the 4 - 2 win over @entity13 which put the @entity15 top of the @entity16 , with the maximum 12 points from their four games so far			0
however , the last 10 years suggest @entity1 fans should n't count their chickens just yet			2
@entity11 ( centre ) has helped @entity1 to achieve maximum points from their first four games history suggests that @entity1 fans must n't get carried away with their team 's brilliant start 2013 - 14 : @entity26 win title 2012 - 13 : @entity28 win title 2011 - 12 : @entity30 2010 - 11 : @entity28 win title 2009 - 10 : @entity1 - @entity1 win title 2008 - 09 : @entity6 - @entity28 win title 2007 - 08 : @entity34 win title 2006 - 07 : @entity36 win title 2005 - 06 : @entity1 - @entity1 win title 2004 - 05 : @entity5 - @entity1 win title only twice in the past decade have the team who have been top after four games ended up as champions			1
this time last year @entity5 were looking down on everyone after four games , but come may they were in fourth staring up at title winners @entity3			0
the @entity48 have made a habit of starting well , but ending up without the coveted trophy			0
over the past 10 years @entity53 's side have been top three times during the early stages without managing to finish the job while @entity57 have won the league five times without spectacular starts - indeed , in 2006 - 07 , the early leaders were @entity36			1
and just two years ago @entity1 - then @entity62 champions under @entity63 - were flying high at the top of the league			2
@entity5 won four of the opening five games last season but fell away as the season progressed @entity3 were crowned @entity16 champions last season despite a bright start from @entity5 @entity57 won the @entity16 title in 2013 after @entity1 led the way during the early stages @entity74 took over @entity1 after @entity63 's eventual sacking but they finished way off the pace of sir @entity78 's final title at @entity57			1
the piece of good news for @entity81 , though , is that the trophy has ended up at @entity83 on the two occasions in which a club ahead after four games has won the @entity16			0
@entity81 's second season in @entity89 football , 2005 - 06 , saw his @entity1 team race into an early lead before claiming a second successive title			0
and @entity94 's 2010 @entity16 triumph - part of a @entity1 double - kicked off in the perfect way as they won their first six games			2
however , history is not on @entity102 's side - and there may be light at the end of the blue tunnel for @entity1 's challengers			0
@entity81 's @entity1 won the @entity16 after a fine start in the 2005 - 06 season @entity94 ( above ) managed @entity1 to a @entity16 and @entity106 double in 2010			1

@entity1 have won all four of their @entity16 games so far
only two teams in the past 10 years have won the @entity16 after being top with four games *played*
@entity1 won the league in 2005 and 2010 after brilliant starts to the season
@entity5 have failed to win the @entity16 in the last 10 years despite being top after four games on four different occasions
@entity57 have been crowned champions five times in past decades despite poor starts
