by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 21 june 2013 scientists have created the world 's first high - definition 3d model of a complete human brain dubbed @entity5			1
@entity5 shows the anatomy of a brain in microscopic detail for the first time ever - at a spatial resolution of 20 microns			1
this is smaller than the size of one fine strand of hair and 250,000 times more detailed than current @entity16 brain scans			1
researchers from @entity18 and @entity19 took 7,400 individual slices from the brain of a deceased 65 - year - old woman and plotted 80 billion neurons during the 10 - year project			1
@entity5 is 250,000 times more detailed than a current @entity16 scan and the digital images were taken from individual slices of a deceased 65 - year - old female 's brain the @entity5 is 250,000 times more detailed than a regular brain scan			1
7,400 individual slices from the brain of a deceased 65 - year - old woman were used to create @entity5			1
80 billion neurons were captured in the project			1
scientists from @entity19 and @entity18 spent 1,000 years collecting the data			0
the total brain reconstruction has taken 10 years to complete			2
each individual slice is half the width of a human hair			1
the brain can be seen in microscopic detail at a spatial resolution of 20 microns			0
and they have now made the brain available online for free to help other scientists develop the field of neuroscience			0
until recently , reference brains did not scan further than the macroscopic , or visible , parts of the brain			0
@entity5 provides a resolution much finer than the typical 1mm resolution from @entity16 studies			1
senior author dr. @entity59 , a professor at the @entity60 at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity19 said the project ' has been a tour - de - force to assemble images of over 7,400 individual histological sections , each with its own distortions , rips and tears , into a coherent @entity72 volume			1
' ' this dataset allows - for the first time - a 3d exploration of human cytoarchitectural anatomy			2
' the sophisticated modern image processing methods reveal an unprecedented look at the very fine details of the human brain 's microstructure , or cellular level			1
the online tool will allow for 3d cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human brain and can be used as a map for plotting small cellular circuit data			2
thin sections of the 65 - year - old human female brain were embedded in paraffin wax and cut by the scientists from @entity91 in @entity18 using a special large - scale tool called a microtome the 20 - micrometer thick histological sections were then mounted on slides and digitised using a high - resolution flatbed scanner			1
it took the scientists approximately 1,000 hours to collect the data it can also map single layers or sublayers of the cerebral cortex , explained the researchers			0
thin sections of a 65 - year - old human female brain , which was embedded in paraffin wax , were cut with a special large - scale tool called a microtome			1
the 20 - micrometer thick histological sections were then mounted on slides , stained to detect cell structures and finally digitised using a high - resolution flatbed scanner			0
this made it possible for the researchers to build a high - resolution 3d brain model			2
it took approximately 1,000 hours to collect the data			0
researchers claim that the new reference brain , which is part of the @entity119 , serves as a ' powerful tool to facilitate neuroscience research ' and ' redefines traditional maps from the beginning of the 20th century			0
' an online animation rotates the @entity5 , left , so researchers can look at it from all angles			2
individual slices are then removed , right , to explain the process the @entity18 and @entity19 researchers used during the project author dr. @entity132 from the @entity133 and director of the @entity136 and @entity135 at the @entity137 in @entity18 said : ' the famous cytoarchitectural atlases of the early 1900 's were simplified drawings of a brain and were based on pure visual analysis of cellular organization patterns			1
' because of the sheer volume of this dataset , the researchers say that there will be a ' push by those who want to use it to develop new and valuable tools for visualization , data management and analysis			0
' ' we plan to repeat this process in a sample of brains so that we can quantify cytoarchitectural variability , ' said dr. @entity59			0
' we will also integrate this dataset with high - resolution maps of white matter connectivity in post-mortem brains			0
' this will allow us to explore the relationship between cortical microanatomy and fiber connectivity , ' said dr. @entity132			0
the researchers have put the @entity5 data online and this digital portal will provide other neuroscientists with 3d cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human brain			1
it can be used as a map for plotting small cellular circuit data as well as map single layers or sublayers of the cerebral cortex , explained the researchers each of the 7,400 brain slices were stained with potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to highlight the different cell structures ' we are planning to integrate our receptor data of the human brain in the reference frame provided by the @entity5 , ' continued senior co-author dr. @entity190 , senior professor of the @entity191 and former director of the @entity136 and @entity135 at the @entity137 in @entity18			1
' we will also transfer high - resolution maps of quantitative data on the regional and laminar distribution of native receptor complexes to the @entity5			2
' this will allow us to explore the relationship between cortical microanatomy and key molecules of neurotransmission			0
' the fine - grained anatomical resolution will also allow scientists to gain insights into the neurobiological basis of cognition , language , emotions and other processes , according to the study			0
the researchers plan to extract measurements of cortical thickness to gain insights into understanding aging and neurodegenerative disorders ; create cortical thickness maps to compare data from in vivo imaging ; integrate gene expression data from the @entity220 ; and generate a brain model with a resolution of 1 micron to capture details of single cell morphology			2
public access of the @entity5 dataset is available through the @entity227			2
the researchers have presented their work in the current issue of the journal @entity232			0
@entity232 's senior editor @entity233 said : ' the authors pushed the limits of current technology			0
' such spatial resolution exceeds that of presently available reference brains by a factor of 50 in each of the three spatial dimensions			0

the @entity5 is 250,000 times more detailed than current @entity16 brain scans
80 billion neurons were captured during the 10 - year project
7,400 individual slices from the human brain of a deceased 65 - year - old woman were used to create @entity5
each slice is half the width of a human hair
