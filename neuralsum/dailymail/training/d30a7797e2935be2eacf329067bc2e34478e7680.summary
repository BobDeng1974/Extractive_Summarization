@entity0 reminded @entity2 coach @entity1 of his predatory credentials with a match - winning hat - trick that helped erase the painful memories of @entity7 last @entity9 visit			1
the former @entity2 international , who finished last season as the @entity15 ’s leading @entity14 - qualified try - scorer with 11 touchdowns , was back in business again on saturday as @entity19 ’s men made hard work of putting @entity22 ’s resurgent @entity21 away			1
his last - minute try - awarded by @entity24 @entity23 but contested by @entity22 and his @entity21 charges - stole what would have been a famous victory from @entity21 ; who also failed to win on the opening day of last season by the narrowest of margins			1
match winner : a straining @entity0 crosses for the winning try elusive : @entity35 crosses for his second try back in it : @entity38 touches down to begin @entity21 ' comeback concentration : @entity21 ' @entity41 passes the ball off the back of a scrum saracens have spent the summer employing a variety of methods to help support their players , including one similar to that used to treat service veterans suffering @entity51 , following the agony of losing in both @entity54 and domestic finals			1
but there ’s nothing like getting back on the bike			0
on saturday they had @entity0 to thank following a below - par performance that saw them take a 21 - 6 first - half lead before allowing another winger with @entity2 credentials , @entity35 , to put @entity21 within sight of victory before @entity0 pounced			1
‘ we had drama here at the end of last season and we had drama here again today , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the intensity was n’t there all the time but we got there in the end			0
’ the 31 - year - old @entity0 made the last of his 14 @entity2 appearances on tour in @entity80 15 months ago and has been overtaken in the pecking order by the likes of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and his opposite man in this game , @entity35			1
opener : @entity0 dives over for his and @entity7 ' first try dive for the line : @entity86 stretches to score a try delighted : @entity0 celebrates his opening score with @entity94 and @entity86 committed : it was a tense encounter at @entity9 between @entity97 rivals @entity21 and @entity7 ‘ i still have @entity2 ambitions but you should be asking @entity1 , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ i want to be involved in the @entity100			0
i think i played well enough last season to be in the squad but nobody has told me what i need to do to get there			0
’ @entity35 will consider himself unlucky to have been on the losing side after producing an enormously encouraging display on his first game back since suffering a serious foot injury at the tail end of last season which cost him his place on @entity2 ’s tour to @entity115			1
in truth , the whole @entity21 team will be kicking themselves after battling their way back from an awful first - half display to find themselves 28 - 20 in front when @entity35 touched down for his second try after 60 minutes			1
they only had themselves to blame in front of 66,164 at @entity9			0
first , @entity0 latched on to replacement @entity125 ’s clever pass to cross in the left - hand corner			2
the fly - half converted to make the score 28 - 27			0
doubling up : @entity0 claims his second try during the thrilling victory over @entity21 nice job : @entity133 congratulates @entity35 on his second try animated : saracens celebrate @entity86 's first half score as @entity21 sensed a repeat of last season ’s defeat to @entity141 on day one of the season , @entity22 ’s men seemed to suffer a case of the collective collywobbles			1
flanker @entity145 — outstanding up until that point — stood still before hitting a ruck close to @entity7 ’ line before being penalised by referee @entity149 and allowing @entity7 to clear their lines and breathe again			2
@entity151 burst through the @entity21 midfield and @entity125 was again on hand to feed @entity0 to bounce over in the corner with @entity155 in close attendance			1
referee @entity149 referred the decision to the @entity24 and , just like last season ’s final on the same ground , the decision went in the attacking team ’s favour			0
this time , unlike their last - gasp defeat to @entity165 in may , @entity7 were the beneficiaries			2
‘ it ’s important we recognised there was some hurt from last season , ’ @entity19 said			0
‘ we ’ve talked about the response we ’ve wanted to have to the way last season ended			0
there ’s certainly been no self - pity at our club			0
’ divine intervention : @entity38 points to the sky after scoring close call : @entity35 just about touches down in the corner under the eagle eyes of the line judge @entity183 : @entity7 and @entity21 players battle for the ball at @entity9 sin bin : @entity7 ' @entity187 is shown the yellow card young , sat disbelieving as his side blew their second @entity97 double header in succession , was left fuming at the decision to award @entity0 ’s third try after he ’d opened his account with another contentious first - half effort which saw him make the slightest of contacts with @entity21 full back @entity198 before touching down			1
‘ our first 40 minutes were n’t good enough , ’ said @entity22			0
‘ we were much better in the second half but ended up committing suicide			0
there were two decisions which did n’t go our way			0
but the reason @entity7 are a champion team is because they take every single opportunity they get			2
’ @entity21 replacement prop @entity208 will be assessed this week after passing the newly updated 10 - minute head injury assessment only to suffer another head knock when he returned .			2

@entity0 crossed in the last minute after @entity21 ' *brilliant* comeback looked to have won the season opener
@entity86 and @entity0 ran in first half tries for @entity7 to give them 20 - 9 half - time lead
@entity38 replied early in the second period for @entity21
@entity35 's *sublime* double turned the match around before @entity0 scored his second try to cut the lead to a single point
the @entity2 winger then came up trumps in a *grandstand* finish
