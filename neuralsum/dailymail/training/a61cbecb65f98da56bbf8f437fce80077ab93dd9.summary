by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 14:09 est , 9 july 2012 the middle of the empty , blazing hot @entity3 desert might not seem the most attractive location to build a new town			1
but when that town is specifically designed as a bombing target by the @entity10 , then the advantages of such an isolated spot soon become apparent			0
it is better known by its nickname ' @entity13 ' , after the call sign of @entity15 , the military commander who came up with the extraordinary idea of constructing the installation			1
most bombed city in the world : the @entity20 - or @entity21 - was built in 1999 about five miles north of the @entity24 / @entity23 border in southern @entity3 @entity13 is used by the @entity10 as a bombing site and has zero inhabitants			1
the nearest town is 20miles away the @entity20 - or @entity21 - was built in 1999 about five miles north of the @entity24 and @entity23 border in southern @entity3 specifically for the air force to practice bomb , rocket and missile targeting			1
incredible pictures show the deserted town which was built to be bombed has 178 buildings made from stacked shipping containers of various sizes which are up to four stories tall			0
@entity13 has , of course , zero inhabitants , instead relying on simulated lifeforms with the nearest town a safe distance of 20 miles away			1
it is the first urban close air support range in the @entity24 military , where all types of aircraft and their crews can practice with rockets , guns , and laser guided training rounds			2
the complex also features vehicle targets , ranging from civilian cars to armoured tanks within its , approximately , half - a - kilometer length boundary			0
one @entity58 instructor told @entity59 in 2009 that the terrain is similar to much of the @entity61 and central @entity62 and so provides a realistic target environment for pilots to improve their precision close air support skills			0
he said : ' the urban layout is actually very similar to the terrain in many villages in @entity69 and @entity70			0
â€œ the @entity72 training we do here at @entity13 is some of the most realistic any pilot or ground controller will get			2
' training ground : a team of students from the @entity80 's @entity79 investigates the aftermath of an aerial assault secluded : @entity13 lies in southern @entity3 about five miles north of the @entity24 / @entity23 border			1
the nearest town is 20miles to the east @entity59 reporter @entity85 revealed how @entity13 was so pummelled by artillery fire during a ' simulated ' attack that it ' looked like it was barely able to keep standing '			2
he wrote : ' the artillery and mortars started firing , troops advanced toward the target complex , and aircraft of all types - carefully controlled by students on the mountain top - mounted one attack run after another			0
' at one point so much smoke and dust filled the air above the " enemy " that nothing could be seen of the target - just one of the real - world problems the students had to learn to cope with that day			0

the @entity20 - or @entity108 - is about five miles north of @entity24 / @entity23 border in southern @entity3
it was built in 1999 and nicknamed ' @entity13 ' after the major who had the idea to build it
