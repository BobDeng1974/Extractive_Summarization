the children of mothers who smoke and breastfeed are more likely to develop serious health problems as they grow up , scientists warned yesterday			2
even a small period of exposure to nicotine in the first months of life raises the danger of illnesses such as obesity , diabetes and cardiovascular disease , compared with those breastfed by non-smoking mothers			1
last night , scientists demanded better information for new mothers on the long - term effects of nicotine exposure on their children ’s health			1
the new research , which was carried out on rats , follows earlier studies on humans which suggested breastfeeding mothers who smoke may pass on long - term health risks to their babies			2
scientists are demanding better information for new mothers after research revealed even a small amount of nicotine while breastfeeding can be harmful for baby the rats were fitted with nicotine - producing implants to model the effect of smoking during breastfeeding			1
they nursed their offspring as normal and the health of the babies was monitored into adulthood			0
the babies grew up to develop problems such as obesity and underactive thyroid glands – hypothyroidism – while those raised by mothers without the nicotine implant remained healthy			2
around 5,000 babies die in the womb or shortly after birth each year in @entity57 as a result of their mothers smoking during pregnancy			0
yet one in four pregnant women smokes , despite warnings about the effects on their baby and widely available @entity66 services to help smokers quit			0
children exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb are at greater risk of a range of health disorders and cot death , as well as later behavioural problems			0
the latest study looked at how nicotine exposure in the first months after birth affects cell and hormonal development			1
the research team , based at the @entity82 in @entity83 , found the nicotine exposure caused a reduction in thyroid hormone levels compared with the baby rats of non-smoking mothers			1
the study - which used rats - looked at nicotine exposure in the first months after birth affects cell and hormonal developmen sensitivity to the hormone leptin , which controls appetite and signals when it ’s time to stop eating , was also lower in the infants of breastfeeding rats that were fitted with the nicotine implants			1
it is thought that smoking in human mothers could affect the health of children in the same way			2
dr @entity105 , who led the study published in the @entity107 , said : ‘ we have shown that even a small period of nicotine exposure during breastfeeding can permanently damage the future health of a child			1
‘ future work on this project will investigate the addiction potential of nicotine and the neurological effects of smoking while breastfeeding on offspring			0
’ in the @entity57 , warnings by doctors about the effects of smoking on the unborn baby were first made in 1971 , while the first national no - smoking campaign was launched in 1974			0
but dr @entity105 says it is vital that more advice is aimed at new mothers			0
she said breastfeeding mums in particular had to be told : ‘ smoking during breastfeeding can be as dangerous to offspring as smoking during pregnancy			0

scientists say even a small amount of nicotine can affect baby for life
tests on rats fitted with nicotine implants *provide* stark warning for mums
nicotine exposure in first months affected cell and hormonal development
sensitivity of hormone which controls appetite lower in these infants
researchers in @entity157 , @entity83 , fear it is the same for human children
