@entity0 , the former chief constable of @entity1 , says the force spent ‘ far more on the team doing the @entity5 checks than we were actually putting into child protection ' more police resources are devoted to vetting law - abiding volunteers and job applicants than pursuing and monitoring sex offenders , a former chief constable warns today			1
last year , 843,000 volunteers were given criminal record checks , including parents who go into school to help children read or assist on trips			1
a study today for the @entity22 think - tank finds that the @entity23 has failed in its pledge to more than halve @entity5 checks , formerly known as @entity27 checks , from 4million to 1.7million a year			1
some 3.9million checks were carried out last year on volunteers and job applicants who could have unsupervised contact with children			1
@entity0 , the former chief constable of @entity1 , says the force spent ‘ far more on the team doing the @entity5 checks – because they were funded by government – than we were actually putting into child protection ’			1
she told researchers : ‘ in most forces , more money goes into checks than investigation			1
’ mrs @entity0 claimed armies of staff worked on vetting nationwide , but the monitoring of sex offenders was generally the responsibility of a ‘ small team ’ of officers who ‘ do n’t have an enormous budget ’			1
offenders deemed to present the highest risk could get visits weekly or a couple of times a month , she said , while the least risky would be seen perhaps once ‘ every few months ’			2
after coming to power in 2010 , the @entity23 pledged to slash the use of checks by the @entity5			1
but anyone who could have unsupervised contact with children at least once a month must still be checked			0
town halls made 661,092 checks last year on those such as parents running the school disco and volunteers who drive the elderly to the shops			1
the report ’s author , @entity71 , said public bodies appeared to be going beyond what was required by the law , with local authorities carrying out checks on public sector jobs such as tree surgeons and a beauty therapy lecturer			2
there are 23 types of checks , depending on the type of position involved			2
the most basic service costs £ 26			2
an enhanced check for a teacher , nurse or care home worker costs £ 46			2
@entity91 : local authorities carrying out checks on public sector jobs such as tree surgeons and a beauty therapy lecturer			2
file picture the total cost has been £ 2billion in a decade , including £ 211.6million last year			1
much of this goes to the consultancy firms making the checks			2
among others , there are 730 people employed by the @entity5 , hundreds of police staff , workers from 3,688 bodies who submit checks , and 300 employees at @entity110			1
but miss @entity71 said that often the worst offenders would not be picked up anyway , adding : ‘ it is notable that many of the shocking cases of child abuse in recent years – from @entity117 to the @entity118 – involved individuals without criminal records			1
the failure was a failure to report and to investigate allegations , rather than a lack of checking			0
’ the @entity124 said : ‘ criminal records checks are essential			1
we changed the vetting and barring arrangements because the old system was disproportionate and excessive			0
without these changes the number of checks would have increased significantly			2
’ shadow home secretary @entity132 rapes recorded by the police have hit their highest level ever , with an average of 60 attacks every day			0
shocking figures , disclosed yesterday , showed that rapes in @entity140 and @entity141 rose by almost 30 per cent to 22,116 in the year to june			0
@entity143 rapes were up by 48 per cent to 294 attacks – almost six a week			0
according to the @entity146 figures , 13,455 of the victims were women , the rest being men and children			0
ministers said victims were ‘ more willing ’ to report sex crimes and police were more likely to take complaints seriously , partly due to greater scrutiny following the @entity117 scandal			0
police recording practices had also improved			0
@entity146 head of crime @entity160 said : ‘ we have seen over the last few years a notable rise in victims coming forward to report historical offences			0
so victims are coming forward now to report recent occurrences rather than historical ones			0
’ the total number of crimes reported to forces in @entity140 and @entity141 was 3.7million , the same as the previous year			1
violent crime surged by 11 per cent to 666,700 offences , but the @entity146 said this could be due to police recording complaints more accurately after accusations of ‘ fiddling ’ figures to meet targets			0
the picture was complicated by the @entity179 of @entity140 and @entity141 , which indicated violent crime had fallen by 23 per cent			0
the survey , which is based on people ’s experiences of crime , found a 16 per cent fall in overall crime to 7.1million incidents , the lowest since 1981 , but it did not include 300,000 frauds			0
shadow home secretary @entity132 said : ‘ these figures show a shocking failure to help rape victims and bring dangerous criminals to justice			0

last year 843,000 volunteers had criminal record checks - costing £ 211m
the total cost for @entity5 checks has been £ 2billion in a decade
more money goes into the checks than into monitoring sex offenders
