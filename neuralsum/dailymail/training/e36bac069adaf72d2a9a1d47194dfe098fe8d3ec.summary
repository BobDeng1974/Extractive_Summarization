the @entity13 share program was launched on monday morning by mayor @entity14			1
that night the bulky blue bikes had been rented out more than six thousand times and cyclists had pedaled a combined distance of almost 14,000 miles			2
@entity3 's bike sharing system is finally off the ground but many users are unhappy about the service they 've received so far however the launch was not without its issues for some customers			1
one man told the @entity27 he was worried he might be fined after he could n't get a second bike out during the first day of the service			2
‘ when i put my card in to get another bike , it gave me red , ’ fumed @entity30 , 40			0
‘ i tried another rack , and it gave me red			0
i ca n’t get any out			0
now i ’m afraid that it is going to give me a $ 1,000 fine ! ’ others have complained that it is too difficult to manoeuvre the bikes in and out of their docking stations			1
‘ you literally have it ram it , ’ said @entity41 , 24			0
@entity45 , 52 , had the opposite problem and without a key card or any excessive force was able to remove a bike from a docking system			0
once the bike scheme is fully operational there will be about 330 stations in @entity54 and @entity55 and thousands of bicycles for rent most popular bike stations on day 1 : ‘ you saw me ! i did n’t use any excessive force ; it just came right out ! , ’ he told @entity60			2

test run : mayor @entity14 tried out a @entity13 for size at the launch of the program on monday morning			1
but the first days of the scheme have suffered a number of hiccups ready to use : the @entity3 citi bike sharing scheme finally began on monday , but the launch had its fair share of problems , including a theft while the bike were being delivered mayor @entity14 and transportation commissioner @entity106 christened the beginning of bike - sharing at a docking station near the @entity111 on monday morning			1

the thief - and the missing bike - have yet to be tracked down			2
a @entity13 spokesman would not comment on the incident			1
difficult start : officials hope to expand to 10,000 bikes and 600 docking stations in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity142 easy access ? hundreds of early adopters of the program are frustrated that their key cards for the scheme have not arrive			1
@entity13 says they were lost in the post hundreds of other users have been left frustrated by their key cards for the scheme not arriving in time for the big launch			1
