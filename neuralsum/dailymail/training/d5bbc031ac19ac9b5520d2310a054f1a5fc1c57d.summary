@entity12 was found by police and welfare officers in 2012 sharing a marital bed with her brother @entity16 , as her children - some as young as ten - were engaging in sex with their underage aunts and uncles , could face up to 10 years ' prison			1
her sons , aged 16 and 15 , were among five of her 13 children taken from her in 2012 because they were the product of a sexual union between ms @entity12 and either her father , brother or another close male relative			1
today , the 48 - year - old , whose real name has been withheld by the @entity30 of @entity7 , is due to appear at @entity31 on monday charged with plotting to kidnap two of her sons back from foster carers			1
@entity12 , a member of the infamous ' @entity35 ' incest family , arrives at @entity37 local court with her lawyer the family were hidden in the hills above a tiny hamlet in @entity7			1
there , four generations of a family practised a cult of incest hidden from the world ms @entity12 also faces charges of recruiting her son @entity49 ( a court appointed name ) to commit a criminal act in the plot in which she allegedly planned to take the boys from their foster home in the middle of the night			1
ms @entity12 had secretly given her sons a mobile phone which they kept in a plastic bag in a bush on the foster property			1
magistrate @entity61 acknowledged in @entity62 on monday that a legal delay in delivery of the transcript of a hearing in june , when @entity67 gave evidence by video link , required the matter be held over			2

she and her 13 children were among 38 inter-related adults and children discovered two years ago living in filthy conditions in the hills surrounding a picturesque farming community nestled in a valley southwest of @entity80			1
@entity12 is accused of hatching a plan to kidnap her sons from foster carers the children had facial deformities , could not speak intelligibly , did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were			1
they were living in filthy caravans and tents with no running water or electricity			0
the case of the @entity67 family is considered to be perhaps the nation 's most appalling saga of child abuse and is among one of the worst accounts of incest ever made public			1
the @entity100 took the rare step last december of revealing the actions it took to remove children from the @entity67 family ( a court - appointed pseudonym to protect identification of minors )			1
four generations of intimate relations among the @entity35 had taken place in @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and finally in @entity7			1
the adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional @entity7 in july 2012 , are now under investigation for child abuse moving state to state , possibly to evade detection , the scandal only came to light because of a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in the hills who did attend school			2
one of the @entity67 family children was overheard saying at the school , ' my sister is pregnant and we do n’t know which of my brothers is the father ’			2

they found the 40 adults and children living in two filthy caravans , two sheds and tents on an unsewered block with no plumbing			1

the children were unwashed , wore dirty clothes and almost all had fungal infections on their feet			2
they were shy and made little eye contact , and the welfare officers learned that few were capable of intelligible speech			0
some had oddly - formed facial features , which scientific tests would later reveal was a result of ' homozygosity ' , or identical gene patterns of both of the children 's parents			2
as shocked as the police and welfare officers were with the squalor and the children , who seemed developmentally delayed or cognitively impaired , they were unaware immediately of the social time bomb emerging on the property			2
in july 2012 , officers from the @entity141 and @entity142 and @entity143 officers turned up at the block , which lies around 30km out of the town between large established farms and untamed scrub what they did n't realise was the children were the result of intimate relations between brothers and sisters , and uncles and nieces and fathers and daughters			2
their family threw back to a set of great - great grandparents who were a brother and sister			0

@entity12 's 14 - year - old rand - daughter , @entity268 reported sexual contact with her uncle , @entity313 ( betty 's son ) who was nine years old , while @entity313 's sister , @entity316 , 8 , watched on			1

on one occasion , three brothers aged 14 years and under tied their sister , 8 , and niece , 13 , naked to a tree			0
the accounts of incestuous underage sex filled pages of court documents			0
clinicians took mouth swabs from the children and geneticists deduced five of the @entity35 children had parents who were ' closely related ' and another five had parents who were ' related '			1
further interviews with the three sisters revealed the astonishing story that @entity12 , @entity229 and @entity228 's maternal grandparents had been brother and sister			2
some of @entity12 's 13 children were probably fathered by her father , @entity351 , and her brother , @entity348 's children may also have been fathered by @entity353 @entity12 's son , @entity49 , and @entity229 's children , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity294 and @entity321 were the result of closely related parents , as were the three children of @entity12 's daughter , @entity359 , 27 , one of whom had died from a rare genetic disease called @entity364 syndrome			1
