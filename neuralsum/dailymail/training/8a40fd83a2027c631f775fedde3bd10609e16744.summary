one hundred years ago today , archduke @entity0 was assassinated ... setting off a chain of events that led to the @entity2			1
but did you know that the @entity5 aristocrat did n’t see the pistol of his assassin because he was ‘ too busy guzzling his tenth @entity8 ’ ? and that gunman @entity14 , a member of @entity16 terror group the @entity12 , had ‘ popped a cap in his a * * for my @entity12 brothers ’ ? dumbing down : assassin @entity14 , a member of @entity16 terror group the @entity12 , in the video well , that ’s according to the @entity20 – which commissioned a five - minute video in which the key figures behind the outbreak of the @entity2 play out the complex tangle of events in the form of a ‘ rap battle ’ – complete with hip - hop style swearing , sexual innuendo and national stereotyping			1
yesterday experts branded the clip – made as part of the corporation ’s efforts to mark the war ’s centenary – as a factually inaccurate , juvenile and desperate attempt to court popularity with a streetwise audience			1
the video – made by production company @entity42 – has actors play the roles of characters including @entity46 , @entity47 of @entity48 and @entity49 of @entity50			1
they make jokes about sex , queen @entity53 , refer to anachronistic characters like @entity57 host @entity56 and describe the @entity58 as having a ‘ snail - sucking , frog - cooking , garlic stench ’			1
rap lyrics by the main characters include : emperor @entity64 ( @entity0 ’s uncle ) : @entity48 , @entity65 , @entity66 , my b * * * * * * , best watch out ‘ cos my trigger finger itches			2
you ’re tiresome , you ’re irksome , like a @entity72 @entity56			1
@entity49 ( @entity50 ) : @entity74 braggarts , you hate the @entity58 and their snail - sucking , frog - cooking , garlic stench			1
( @entity78 pans over to @entity79 standing in the corner )			2
as for your dreadnoughts , wave them goodbye i ’ll make your navy into gravy for my sauerkraut pie			2
@entity49 : look into my eyes , you see compromise ? your collective demise will see our rise			1
i ca n’t back down now , i ’ll look a clown now			2
@entity94 n’t * * * * that can stop this countdown now			2
i ’m going for a lie down now			0
@entity97 , of the @entity98 , said : ‘ it ’s a desperate , frantic and hopeless attempt to engage children , they have given up on every sensible method so they resort to rap music			1
' it ’s just another example of the complete dumbing down of what history should be about			0
they would argue they are making it accessible to young people but it ’s actually very patronising in that sense because it fails to challenge them			0
‘ it ’s a desperate attempt to appeal to the street , to children they have already lost , basically this is an indication they have given up on any proper teaching			1
’ the video , which has been watched more than 21,000 times since it was uploaded on @entity125 on tuesday , was written by comedian @entity126			0
he has admitted that when he was commissioned for the project he knew ‘ b * * * * * all about @entity2 , except what i ’d gleaned from @entity130 ’			0
@entity132 historian professor sir @entity131 said : ‘ i do not think this is a sensible way to engage people and it runs the risk of further distorting history in the process			0
@entity14 also seems to be a @entity16 rather than a @entity139			0
’ @entity141 , of the @entity142 ’ @entity140 , said licence fee payers would be angry at the use of cash for ‘ lazy national stereotypes and off - colour gags ’			0
@entity148 did not respond to requests for a comment			0
a spokesman for the @entity20 said : ‘ @entity153 warnings are given about the content at the start of this video which introduces younger audiences - in a humorous and accessible way - to the complicated political alliances that led to the outbreak of @entity2			0
‘ we are marking the @entity162 with our most ambitious @entity164 season of programming to date and this @entity167 film sits alongside over 2,500 hours of landmark documentary series , commemoration , drama , debate , music , arts , @entity175 - wide events and online activity			0
