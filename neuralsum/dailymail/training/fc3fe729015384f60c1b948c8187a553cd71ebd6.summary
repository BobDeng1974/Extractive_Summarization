ten years ago , @entity0 was at @entity1 celebrating @entity4 ’s famous @entity3 victory over @entity5			1
he was the world ’s best bowler			2
on tuesday night , he will be at @entity8 football ground in his hometown of @entity10 , a rookie manager making his dugout debut in the @entity13			1
it is all a far cry from those heady days of 2005 when @entity0 was a guest of the prime minister and one of the most famous sportsmen in the country			1
former @entity4 bowler @entity0 has been named as manager of @entity20 @entity10 @entity0 played a key role in helping @entity4 win the @entity3 ten years ago but football has always been his first love			1
his dad , @entity24 , played for @entity25 in the conference and his brother , @entity27 , is now on the books of @entity29			2
growing up in the former mining town of @entity10 – home to @entity33 and @entity34 winners @entity35 and @entity36 – he was surrounded by footballing folklore from a young age			1
@entity0 himself was a player under @entity41 ’s current boss , @entity40 , at the club ’s school of excellence during the early nineties			1
in fact , the sight of the former @entity48 star at @entity49 – where he was honoured with a seat for life following the @entity3 triumph – or on the touchline of a @entity13 ground is very much a familiar one in these parts			1
what will be unfamiliar , however , is watching the 36 - year - old patrol his technical area when ninth - tier @entity60 take on @entity61 this evening			1
@entity0 established himself as one of the world 's best bowlers during his time in @entity66 the club 's average gate is 200 but 500 are expected for the unveiling of @entity0 , whose part - time role pays a token wage to cover expenses and will involve at least two weeknight training sessions and saturday matches			1
but @entity0 – who has the full support of wife , @entity77 , and their four children – believes he has a long - term future in the game and insists his appointment is no publicity stunt			1
‘ anyone who knows me understands that football has always been first , ’ he tells @entity84 ahead of his venture into management			1
‘ @entity13 football is something i have watched since i was old enough to walk - not many people have watched more non-league games than i have			1
@entity0 was known as the @entity93 during his playing days and is a @entity41 fan @entity0 has taken the surprise move to go into football management following his retirement from cricket ‘ i played until i was 16 at @entity10 but had to stop to concentrate on cricket			1
but because of my family – my dad , brother and uncles all played – i ’ve always been around football dressing - rooms			1
‘ this opportunity presented itself and it felt right			2
the club has solid foundations but they needed a change with some fresh ideas and i ’ve got a fantastic team with me ( coaches @entity111 and @entity113 )			2
‘ i can assure you one thing , this is anything but a publicity stunt			1
we are in it for the right reasons			2
it certainly is n’t for financial gain			2
‘ the club has so much going for it and we want to be part of that			2
i know the league and i know what ’s going on			0
we ’re in a bit of a relegation fight but i ’m excited by it			0
‘ who knows what the future holds for me ? i ’m going to start my coaching badges this summer			0
by that point i will have a better understanding of management and the experience of a few months in the job			2
’ @entity0 ( left ) chats with @entity141 prior to @entity143 's match with @entity144 in july 2014 @entity0 ’s own playing days are behind him			1
indeed , he says the club would n’t have a strip big enough to fit him now			0
but already he has been on the phone using his contacts to bring in some new faces			0
so what sort of manager will @entity0 be ? ‘ if you have played a professional sport at the top level then those core values transfer – a winning mentality and demanding certain standards , ’ he says			1
‘ i was always different in my professional career as a cricketer			0
if i did n’t agree with something then i would speak up , i was my own man			0
i will be honest with the players and will challenge them			0
‘ i want to build a team			0
i want people to come back and watch us , to make it as happy a club as it can be			0
this is my hometown and this means a lot to me , i want to make a difference			0
’ @entity0 breaks off as his four kids return from school			1
he has tea to make and then a round of phone calls to see which players are available			0
‘ i ’ve only got about eight fully fit players at the moment , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve had a text from @entity181 asking “ which position do you want me to play ? ”			0
’ while @entity181 may joke , @entity0 is deadly serious when it comes to his new career			2
so who are @entity10 ? a non-league football club who play in the @entity190 town of @entity10 , located about 15 miles north of @entity41			1
founded in 1883 , they are known as ' the @entity192 ' and play in the @entity193			0
what level is that ? it is level nine on the @entity198 - for this part of the country , the @entity196 is level one , then @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and then @entity10 's league			1
they pit themselves against the likes of @entity29 , @entity213 and @entity214			0
where do they play ? at @entity217 , which has a capacity of about 2,000			0
the club moved there in 2008 and their record attendance for a competitive fixture is 904 for a league game with @entity223 in march 2013			0
what are their colours ? black and white stripes , similar to @entity41 's			0
have they ever won anything ? they have twice won the league below their present one and are 10 times winners of the @entity233 , the latest coming in 2013			0
their furthest run in the @entity236 came way back in 1926 - 27 , when they played @entity238 in the third round .			2

@entity0 was recently named manager of non-league @entity10
the @entity3 hero has made the shock move to football management
the former @entity4 fast bowler makes his dugout debut on tuesday night
the 36 - year - old insists this is no publicity stunt and that football has been always first for him in his life
