by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 19:09 est , 31 may 2012 @entity1 was given a clean bill of health by @entity4 last night just 25 minutes after disclosing damning new details of his closeness to @entity7			1
the prime minister backed his culture secretary despite the revelation that mr @entity1 exchanged friendly texts with mr @entity7 before and after assuming responsibility for the @entity14 takeover bid			1
in addition , it emerged mr @entity1 was in phone contact with the media boss on the very day he was handed oversight of the controversial deal			2
mr @entity4 and chancellor @entity33 are also facing tough questions over exactly why the @entity35 was handed responsibility for the @entity14 deal even though they were aware of his enthusiastic support for it			1
despite the startling revelations at the @entity43 , the prime minister formally dismissed demands for mr @entity1 to face an investigation into whether he breached ministerial rules just 25 minutes after he had left the witness box			1
that swift decision drew a sharp response from sir @entity50 , former chairman of the committee on standards in public life , who said it was an ' error of judgment '			0
' i just get the feeling it 's beginning to feel like the latter end of the @entity62 government in not having the high standards that the public want to see from the political class , ' he said			0
@entity66 insisted no evidence that mr @entity1 had mishandled the bid had emerged during his six hours before the inquiry , and allegations against him would not be referred to sir @entity71 , the prime minister 's independent adviser on the @entity73			1
under pressure : @entity1 , pictured above left leaving his central @entity76 home this morning , has been questioned over contact made by his closest aide with @entity80 lobbyist @entity79 ( pictured right ) that was despite evidence that @entity7 , the @entity80 boss , had texted mr @entity84 played ' on the day he decided not to refer the @entity14 bid to the @entity86			1
@entity87 said it was clear he had breached the code , misled @entity90 and should resign			0
mr @entity1 also admitted yesterday that he had considered resigning amid the controversy over his department 's handling of the bid			1
but he finally agreed that his special adviser @entity95 , who exchanged hundreds of texts and emails with @entity80 , should go instead			0
he told the inquiry : ' i did think about my own position , but i had conducted the bid scrupulously , and i believed it was possible to demonstrate that , and i decided it would n't be appropriate for me to go			0
' the inquiry was told the mr @entity1 sent a text to mr @entity7 just hours before he was given responsibility for determining the @entity14 bid congratulating him on gaining @entity110 clearance for the deal			1
' just @entity112 to go , ' he told mr @entity7 , referring to the broadcasting watchdog			2
talks : @entity1 told the @entity25 that he had an unminuted meeting as @entity35 with @entity7 ( pictured ) mr @entity1 also texted mr @entity33 saying he was ' seriously worried we are going to screw this up ' minutes after mr @entity32 was revealed to have been caught boasting he had ' declared war ' on the @entity7 empire			1
he also emailed @entity120 , then director of communications at @entity121 , to say : ' could we chat about this ... am seriously worried @entity32 will do real damage to @entity124 with his comments			0
' though mr @entity1 had been expressing support in both public and private for the deal , the @entity126 then decided to hand him responsibility for the bid as mr @entity32 was forced to step aside			2
government insiders are now braced for mr @entity33 to be called to give evidence to the inquiry to explain his role in mr @entity1 's appointment after it emerged he texted the @entity35 to declare : ' i hope you like the solution ! ' @entity87 said mr @entity4 and mr @entity33 had replaced a minister clearly biased against mr @entity7 with one who was clearly in favour			1
despite his officials advising him not to get involved with any ' external discussions ' on the deal for fear of compromising the government 's impartiality , mr @entity1 had spoken out publicly in favour and given a ' sympathetic hearing ' to mr @entity7 without his officials present in a phone call in november 2010			1
shunned : @entity1 dropped plans to meet former @entity66 communications director @entity120 ( pictured ) amid fears it would look bad if they were spotted together resigned : when told @entity156 ( pictured ) had stepped down from @entity157 , @entity1 replied : ' about bloody time ! ' the @entity35 insisted yesterday that he acted impartially once he was given responsibility for the bid the following month and took advice from regulators			2
mr @entity1 admitted he had not told officials deciding whether he could act impartially that he had sent mr @entity4 a memo supporting the bid			1
in march last year , when mr @entity1 decided not to refer the takeover to the @entity86 , mr @entity7 texted him : ' @entity166 few days			1
' the culture secretary replied : ' thanks think we got right solution ! ' @entity172 bid to take full control of @entity14 was eventually abandoned as the phone hacking scandal erupted			2
mr @entity1 was emotional when he spoke about the resignation of mr @entity95 , who admitted ' inappropriate ' contacts with @entity80 lobbyist @entity177			1
the @entity35 admitted he had not given ' express instructions ' to mr @entity95 about talking to the company			0
' i wish we had spelled out to him that he needed to be very careful , ' he said			0
' i wish he had told us about the pressure he was under and the barrage he was getting			0
' @entity95 is one of the most decent , straight and honourable persons that you could imagine and even he was not able to maintain the impartiality that he needed to			0
' he admitted finally telling mr @entity95 : ' everyone here thinks you should go			0
' but he added : ' i was n't including myself in “ everyone ”			0
' @entity192 , @entity87 's deputy leader , said : ' @entity1 should never have been given the quasi-judicial role in the first place as he was biased in favour of the bid			2
' he should not be in his job now as he has broken the @entity73 and misled @entity90			0
at the very least , @entity4 should refer him to the independent adviser on ministerial interests			2
mr @entity4 said he would stand up for high standards but he is sweeping this matter under the carpet			0
' a @entity66 spokesman said : ' mr @entity1 's evidence has shown that he acted properly while he was responsible for the @entity14 bid			1
he took independent advice at every turn , as well as a number of decisions which were against @entity80 's wishes			2
' as the permanent secretary of the department made clear , @entity1 set up a process which left him with a “ vanishingly small ” chance to “ manipulate ” the bid			0
' there are some lessons to be learned from this process and that 's why the cabinet secretary has written to all departments regarding the way quasi-judicial decisions are taken			0
the prime minister will not be referring @entity1 to sir @entity71			0
' @entity224 : details of the government 's licence fee settlement were emailed by @entity1 's former special advisor @entity95 ( pictured left ) to a lobbyist working for @entity80 , run by @entity230 ( right ) ' @entity231 ' : @entity1 , shown at the @entity25 today , sent an extraordinary text message congratulating @entity7 after his £ 8billion @entity14 takeover was given the go - ahead by the @entity110 ' illegal ' tip - off : @entity79 's january 2011 email in which he writes that he had been told of an announcement @entity1 was due to make			1

@entity4 refuses to order independent investigation into whether he breached the ministerial code
@entity33 could now be called as witness to @entity242 after he is also dragged into *row* over messages on day @entity245 mr @entity1 was given @entity14 brief
mr @entity1 admits he was ' sympathetic ' to @entity80 's bid to take over @entity14
mr @entity1 texted @entity7 to congratulate him on @entity80 *promotion* , saying : ' i am sure you will really miss @entity112 in @entity253 ! '
