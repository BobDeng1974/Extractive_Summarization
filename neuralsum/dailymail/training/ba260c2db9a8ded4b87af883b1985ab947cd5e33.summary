@entity0 turns 60 on sunday			1
this season he ’s proving that you are never too old to learn new tricks			0
from being booed off the pitch last season to winning in style this time around , things have changed dramatically at @entity7			1
the football has been transformed and with that , so has the mood at @entity11			0
for @entity0 , so often associated with pragmatic , long - ball football , it has been the biggest turnaround in 20 years of management			1
his team have been playing with style , pace and , most importantly , are getting the results to go with it			2
compared to this time last year , there were eight new starters in @entity7 ’s last fixture , so credit to the manager for bedding in those new faces so quickly			1
with @entity43 — a colleague of mine at @entity46 , where passing football was always the mantra — and @entity49 on the staff , the balance has now been tipped			0
who would have thought that we would be talking about @entity0 using midfield diamonds and 4 - 3 - 3s ? he has shown great tactical awareness and flexibility and the fans and the players are loving it			1
@entity57 celebrates after wrapping up a 3 - 1 victory against @entity59 last month @entity0 must have been the only man in the country who thought @entity27 could play as a no 10 at the tip of a midfield diamond			1
it was a masterstroke and @entity27 is a player reborn			0
we talk about @entity66 ’ tactical ability at @entity68 but @entity27 will have loved wiping the smile off his face when @entity7 beat @entity59 3 - 1			1
@entity27 has now almost become a barometer for how the team performs			0
he has created the most chances in the @entity74 — level with @entity76 on 22 — and has made almost twice as many passes per game as last season			2
he is playing with a smile on his face and giving everything for the cause — something @entity7 fans demand as a bare minimum			2
with players such as @entity87 , who has spent most of his career playing passing football , @entity0 has seen the way forward and it ’s as if he now trusts his side to get the ball down and play			1
the defence has been consistent and it ’s good to see two young @entity97 full backs getting their chance			0
with @entity87 now back in full flow , it is obvious @entity0 wants to get the ball down and play @entity102 has the potential to be a top player and @entity105 is a shining example to any young @entity97 professional			1
released by @entity59 at youth level , he kept going , worked his way up via @entity110 and @entity111 and is now carving out a career at the top level			0
of course it always helps when you have players who score goals			0
you almost expect @entity7 to score whenever @entity119 and @entity25 are on the pitch			1
they are players who create a real buzz among the fans			0
the atmosphere at @entity11 is in sharp contrast to last season when it became an ordeal to play at home			0
it ’s a tough ground and the fans expect their side to play ‘ the @entity7 way ’			1
it was similar for @entity0 at @entity134 where he was almost driven out because of the fans ’ expectations of style			2
that experience has helped him at @entity7 and he has adapted			2
it ’s still early days and if improvements do n’t continue things could take a turn for the worse			0
so let ’s hope @entity7 fans can enjoy the positive play for a long time to come			2
it has been a huge change in mood at @entity11 since last season , with fans enjoying what they 're seeing @entity150 i was at the @entity152 this week to see , among others , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 inducted into the @entity157			0
many worthy people were honoured and we paid tribute to the @entity161 of the 1880s			0
this week was also the tenth anniversary of @entity164 ’s @entity161 , so let ’s hope they do n’t leave it more than 100 years to honour that team ! @entity164 celebrate winning the @entity74 title at the home of their bitter rivals , @entity172			1

@entity174 **'s** @entity7 sit *seventh* in the @entity74
it is the manager **'s** biggest turnaround in 20 years of management
from being booed off the pitch too winning in style , things have changed
with players like @entity87 , @entity0 wants to get the ball down and play
@entity25 and @entity119 have added much - needed *firepower*
