@entity1 refused to help dying @entity3 star @entity2 get a bed at a @entity6 hospital at the forefront of experimental treatment for @entity9 , it has been claimed			1
then first lady mrs @entity1 turned down a request from @entity2 's publicist for help getting the actor transferred to a @entity6 military hospital where he could be seen by dr @entity15			1
dr @entity15 , who had treated @entity2 for @entity9 months earlier , was at the time working on an early experimental drug that promised to help bolster the immune systems of @entity9 sufferers			1
mrs @entity1 turned down his request for help getting @entity9 treatment in @entity6 @entity2 , who had kept secret his homosexuality and his @entity9 , was eventually given a bed at the @entity36 in @entity37 - thanks to strings pulled with @entity6 officials			1
but in the end it transpired that his condition had deteriorated so badly that even dr @entity15 's experimental @entity44 - 23 treatments could not help him			0
he chose to return to @entity46 and died just two months later , in october 1985			0
one of @entity3 's hottest hunks throughout the 1950s and 1960s , 59 - year - old @entity2 had grown close to @entity48 , the future president who started out an actor , through showbusiness circles			1
but by the mid- 1980s @entity2 was no longer the broad - shouldered embodiment of ' the @entity29 man '			1
he was frail and gaunt , and one sunday evening in july 1985 he collapsed in the @entity52 , just hours after arriving in the city			0
it was a closely guarded secret that @entity2 was in the @entity6 capital desperately seeking treatment for @entity9 , but the doctor he had come to see , dr dormant , could not get permission to admit the star to move to the military hospital where he worked , or even to visit him as an outpatient in the @entity29 hospital where he was taken after his collapse , @entity54 reports			1
@entity2 in 1985 : by the mid- 1980s @entity2 was no longer the broad - shouldered embodiment of ' the @entity29 man ' , but he was still keeping his illness - and his homosexuality - a secret @entity2 's @entity29 publicist @entity69 sent a desperate telegram to the @entity71 pleading for help with persuading the @entity6 military to allow the actor to be treated , @entity54 reports			1
' doctor @entity15 specialist treating @entity2 in @entity52 , reports only one hospital in the world can offer necessary medical treatment to save life of @entity2 or at least alleviate his illness			1
this hospital is @entity81 in the city of @entity37 , ' said the telegram , discovered in the @entity83 and seen by @entity54			0
' commanding general of @entity85 has turned down @entity2 as a patient because he is not @entity6			2
doctor @entity15 in @entity52 believes a request from the @entity89 or a high @entity29 official would change his mind			0
can you help by having someone call the commanding general ’s office at the @entity85 at the above number			0
' but mrs @entity1 , acting on the advice of deputy press secretary @entity98 , turned down the request			0
heart - throb : actor @entity2 pictured left at the height of his fame in 1959			2
right is a scene showing @entity104 and @entity2 from the 1955 film @entity105 @entity2 with @entity106 : the pair starred together in several @entity3 romantic comedies in the 1960s mr @entity98 told @entity54 he recommended that mrs @entity1 refer to the matter to the @entity111 in @entity6 in an effort to be seen to ' be fair and not do anything that would appear to favor personal friends			1
' insisting the decision had nothing to do with @entity9 policy , he said the @entity119 ' view was ' well , we 're so sorry ' , but the couple ' were about treating everybody the same ' and did n't want to make exceptions for friends			2
but the decision came at a time of virulent homophobia in the @entity29 , where conservatives in particular had come to see the @entity9 epidemic as a gay plague sent by @entity131 as a punishment for homosexuality			2
@entity134 , a prominent activist for @entity9 awareness and treatment , told @entity54 the @entity119 ' excuse seemed ' strange ' , since they often did favours for their friends while in power			2
' i ’m sure if it had been @entity144 in that hospital with some rare , incurable cancer , @entity141 would have been dispatched to help save him , ' he said			0
' there ’s no getting around the fact that they left @entity2 out to dry			0
as soon as he had that frightening homosexual disease , he became as unwanted and ignored as the rest of us			0

actor sought a bed at @entity6 hospital at forefront of @entity9 treatment
@entity2 's @entity29 publicist sent telegram *begging* @entity162 to *intervene*
but she refused saying she did n't want to be seen to help out friends
@entity6 officials eventually helped @entity2 get a bed at the military hospital
but by then his aids had *progressed* too far and he could n't be helped
