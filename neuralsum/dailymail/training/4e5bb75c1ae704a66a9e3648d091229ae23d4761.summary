a hospital boss embroiled in a cancer waiting time scandal was accused last night of bullying staff			1
@entity4 , chief executive of the trust running @entity6 , was said to have presided over a culture obsessed with government targets			1
his personal assistant @entity9 quit last month after 28 years at the hospital , claiming her ‘ life was made hell ’			1
@entity9 ( left ) worked at @entity6 for 28 years and was a @entity14 for @entity4 ( right ) , the chief executive of the trust which ran it			1
she quit last month after her ' life was made hell ' by @entity4 the 56 - year - old , who was his executive pa until last month , claims she left because she could no longer tolerate dr @entity4 ’s demands			1
her husband @entity22 , 59 , says she has reported the alleged bullying to health watchdog monitor			0
‘ my wife had worked at the hospital for the past 28 years – for the past two years for @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ that guy made my wife ’s life hell			0
his expectancy was that she would run his life for him and arrange everything			0
‘ he degraded her , he ran her down all the time			0
it got to the stage where he was telling her what time she had to go for her lunch			0
' he said his wife contacted health union @entity38 and human resources before quitting last month			0
the mother of two has now taken a job in @entity42			0
mr @entity43 criticised dr @entity4 for claiming he would not tolerate bullying by staff : ‘ it is him that is the bully , and that comes from the top downwards			1
there is a cultural problem without a doubt			0
it can only come from the top			0
’ police are examining a report by the @entity56 saying officials were fiddling figures to make it seem the hospital was meeting guidelines for treating cancer patients			1
thousands of patients may have been affected			0
it has published claims that staff have been ‘ pressured or bullied ’ by managers to change cancer waiting times – potentially putting lives at risk			1
dr @entity4 – in charge of the trust since 2010 and on £ 165,000 a year – held a widely discredited internal inquiry into the data fiddling claims in 2012			1
he has also said the hospital ‘ can not accept and does not accept any kind of bullying ’			2
the allegations however include that : he sits on a board set up by sir @entity83 last year as a centre of excellence for managers to develop ‘ outstanding leadership in health ’			1
@entity6 is being investigated by police following a @entity56 report saying officials were fiddling figures @entity93 , a regional director for the @entity94 , said : ‘ for the last two or three years , @entity6 has been a flashing red light on my dashboard			1
‘ we have been raising concerns over the culture of bullying at the hospital since 2011 – we have dealt with dozens of complaints from our nurses			2
’ mrs @entity93 said it was easy to see how staff may have felt bullied or under pressure to change data , adding : ‘ it is bullying , it is oppressive			1
it is about do n’t speak up , do n’t say anything , keep your head down and get on with it			0
’ she said she experienced such ‘ intimidation ’ first hand when dr @entity4 swore at her during a private meeting and told her twice to ‘ shut up ’ , after she suggested cleaning cuts could be linked to a rise in the superbug @entity119			1
@entity6 was under pressure to meet targets after being fined £ 16,000 in march last year			2
@entity123 primary care trust penalised it for missing the 62 - day deadline for two patients to receive initial treatment and a delayed consultation for a woman with ‘ breast symptoms ’			2
in a letter to a colleague last week , a consultant at the hospital wrote : ‘ the pressure on staff in the hospital has been absolutely awful over the last 2 years at all levels of the organisation ’			1
he also spoke of doctors ‘ being badgered about cancer breaches by clerks in the cancer coding department ’			1
however , he accused the @entity56 of mounting a witch hunt against the trust			0
a trust spokesman would not comment on the allegations that waiting times were fiddled because an independent investigation is underway			1
and he said discussing mrs @entity9 would be a ‘ breach of confidentiality ’			2
but he said dr @entity4 had not told mrs @entity93 to shut up			1
the trust insists that targets were not put ahead of patient safety			0
dr @entity4 worked as a junior doctor before becoming an executive in the pharmaceutical industry and then returning to the @entity158			1
health chiefs at @entity6 repeatedly ignored allegations made by staff and patients that cancer waiting times were being manipulated			1
at least six employees contacted senior managers or board members to complain about the practice since december 2011 , but no action was taken			0
@entity4 , the chief executive , was even contacted directly by a patient as early as march 2011			2
it is believed the trust ’s most senior executives missed at least three major opportunities to take action , potentially putting lives at risk			0
these were : march 2011 : patient @entity178 contacted dr @entity4 in 2011 after a nurse told him openly in front of other patients that she had heard records were being altered			1
but rather than act on the information , the chief executive sent an astonishing reply saying he would only investigate if the patient had evidence of wrongdoing			0
it manager mr @entity178 said he waited more than four months for surgery to have part of his prostate removed , after a blood test indicated he could have cancer			0
when he asked a nurse why there had been a delay , he was stunned by her response			0
‘ the nurse said she was very sorry and said the rumour was waiting lists were being manipulated , ’ he said			2
‘ she said the rumour was they were removing people from the waiting list and putting them back on again with new dates so their wait would not seem too long			2
i could n’t believe it			0
’ mr @entity178 , 52 , wrote a letter to dr @entity4 to say he was ‘ extremely concerned ’ to hear of attempts to ‘ manipulate the waiting list system ’			1
the @entity212 is accused of manipulating waiting times for cancer patients , thousands of which could have been affected ( file picture ) yet , rather than launch an immediate investigation , the hospital chief sent a curt reply three weeks later , in april 2011			1
it said : ‘ your fax implies irregularities in the management of waiting lists			2
if you would like to provide me with the names or evidence or waiting list irregularities i will investigate this further			0
' the trust does not support or tolerate any manipulation of patient records			0
’ mr @entity178 ’s wife @entity234 said : ‘ he asked for us to get evidence , but that is for him to do			2
he ’s at the hospital , he has the records			0
’ february 2012 : the hospital board failed to act when two female clerical workers alerted senior managers that staff members were being pressured to change data			2
it prompted a brief investigation by two of dr @entity4 ’s most senior executives during which the whistleblowers were not even interviewed and no action was taken			2
dr @entity4 , 52 , has since admitted the internal investigation was ‘ inadequate ’ , but said ‘ it did not seem to be as serious at the time as it was ’			1
spring 2013 : dr @entity4 was contacted again when a female member of staff sent him an email to report the manipulation of data and bullying			1
a source said : ‘ it contained a lot of evidence of what was going on and was not a short email			0
most chief executives would have made it their duty to immediately investigate it and speak to the person who reported it			0
' instead , they received a one - line email which said a board member would look into it			0
’ @entity277 , of the union @entity38 , said : ‘ we understand that junior staff informed board members about the falsification of data and the bullying of staff to keep quiet about it , in both 2012 and 2013			2
' we do not accept the trust ’s position that the first they heard about it was in august 2013 , when it was reported to the @entity56			0

@entity9 worked at @entity6 for 28 years
