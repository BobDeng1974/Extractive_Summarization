by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:50 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 11 may 2013 the archbishop of @entity3 has ordered an independent inquiry into claims against a former cathedral dean			1
dr @entity7 said the @entity8 treats child abuse allegations ' with the utmost seriousness '			1
his statement comes after his predecessor , @entity12 , denied suggestions he covered up allegations against @entity15 , a former @entity16 , who died from cancer five years ago			1
@entity12 , who was archbishop of york between 1995 and 2005 , was twice informed about allegations against mr @entity15 , who is said to have abused chorister @entity19 in @entity20 in the 1980s and a school boy in @entity22			1
inquiry : archbishop of york dr @entity7 has ordered an independent investigation into claims against @entity15 @entity19 said he was first singled out by the @entity16 , the very reverend @entity15 , at the age of 11 and was then a close companion of his over a five - year period			1
the allegations made in public by mr @entity19 for the first time this week led to suggestions of a cover - up over the @entity8 ’s response following complaints to bishops in 2003			1
but the former archbishop of @entity3 , @entity12 , who at the time oversaw the @entity20 diocese , said he did not tell police and social services because @entity8 rules then did not require it and because the @entity42 was dying of cancer			1
mr @entity19 , now 40 , said he was sleeping in the @entity42 ’s bed by the time he was 13 and by his mid-teens was spending almost every weekend and many nights at the cleric ’s house			2
he went with him on holidays to @entity51 , the @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54			2
the abuse started when mr @entity15 began the grooming process in 1984 and ended after suspicions were raised in the @entity20 diocese in 1989 , mr @entity19 told the @entity59 newspaper			1
in 2004 , @entity60 , who had by then retired , was stripped of his right to lead @entity8 services by @entity12 but no information was passed on to police or social services			1
the @entity42 died in 2007			2
scandal : former archbishop of york @entity12 , left , was told of child sex abuse allegations against @entity16 @entity15 , right , but did not report them to the police yesterday @entity12 said in a statement : ' throughout my time as bishop and archbishop i always adhered to the statutory practices of the @entity8 concerning safeguarding			1
' i strenuously deny ( and am obviously disappointed at ) the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter			2
' he said the @entity8 's 1999 policy on @entity83 , which was in effect at the time but which has subsequently been reviewed , stated that there is no automatic legal obligation on the @entity8 to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services			1
but he said the policy stated it was essential to consider whether children may still be at risk from the alleged abuser and , if so , report the matter to the police or social services			1
he said : ' in considering whether children would be at risk from @entity15 i decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery			1
the following year i revoked @entity15 's permission to officiate			1
he died two years later			2
' and @entity12 added : ' i am deeply aware of the pain caused to any victim of child abuse , especially at the hands of a trustworthy person within the church			0
i do encourage any person who believes they have been a victim of abuse to come forward and to inform the police			1
' dr @entity7 's office issued a statement today which said : ' the archbishop of @entity3 is in the process of setting up an @entity121 specifically into the issues surrounding the reports relating to alleged child abuse by the late @entity15			1
' when any church related abuse comes to light the @entity8 's first concern must be for the victim offering support and apologising for the abuse , acknowledging that the effects can be lifelong			0
' when the @entity121 makes its report the archbishop will make its findings public			2
' the @entity8 continues to review its @entity83 and @entity136 policies regularly to ensure that the @entity8 is a safe place for all			0
' child abuse is a heinous and personally damaging crime , it is therefore incumbent on the @entity8 to treat such matters with the utmost seriousness			0
' mr @entity19 ’s lawyers have now made a personal injury compensation claim against the @entity42 of @entity20			0
he said that until last year he thought he could deal with the memories but then he felt ‘ there ’s something drastically wrong with me and i then started to scream very loudly that i needed help			0
’ mr @entity19 said he came from a poor background in @entity152 and joined the cathedral choir in @entity20 at the age of seven			0
four years later @entity60 , a former headmaster and then the most senior education official working for the @entity8 ’s parliament , the @entity156 , arrived in the city			0
he said the @entity42 showed him special favour , helping him with his homework , picking him up in his car to take him to choir practice , asking him out to tea and taking him for days out			0
he asked mr @entity19 ’s mother if the boy could stay with him overnight			2
the room in which the boy slept had a large poster of a horrifying painting by 16th century artist @entity170 , which gave him nightmares			2
cathedral : @entity15 targeted a @entity20 choirboy as well as a pupil at an @entity22 boarding school mr @entity19 said : ‘ he turned round to me one day and said , “ would you rather stay in my room ? is that painting too scary for you ? ” and of course i said yes			1
’ mr @entity19 began sleeping in the @entity42 ’s bed , where eventually hugs became kissing			0
he said that sexual contact began after he was distressed over a break - up with a girlfriend			2
he said he felt obliged to perform sexual acts when the @entity42 asked : ‘ do you love me this much ? ’ mr @entity19 told the @entity59 he had now broken off contact with his own family			0
he said : ‘ i have no relationship with my family now because i asked severe , strong questions of my family : why did you let it happen ? i was the boyfriend of a monster – so what does that make me ? ’ mr @entity19 said that he was told by the @entity42 that if questioned by the @entity201 he should lie about what was going on			0
after a senior cathedral official did begin to inquire about the relationship , the @entity42 told mr @entity19 to quit the choir in 1989 and he did so			0
he last saw the @entity42 on his wedding day , when the @entity42 conducted the ceremony			0
mr @entity19 later told his wife about the abuse			0
‘ as soon as i told her , our relationship split like an axe , ’ he added			0
the right reverend @entity214 , the head of the @entity215 , said : ‘ as a church we will always apologise for past systems that let down the vulnerable and offer support to anyone whose life has been affected			0
today we have robust safeguarding policies in place			0
