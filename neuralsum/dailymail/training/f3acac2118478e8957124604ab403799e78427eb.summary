by @entity0 close : @entity1 pictured with @entity2 in the background @entity1 ’s closest ally launched a withering attack on @entity6 last night – and accused him of holding back vital school reforms			1
@entity2 said the prime minister lacked ‘ the slightest sense of purpose ’ and had failed to give mr @entity1 the backing he needs to drive through reforms aimed at revolutionising school standards			1
he mocked mr @entity6 as a ‘ sphinx without a riddle ’ , and warned the prime minister is ill - served by ‘ sycophantic ’ advisers who fawn over him and refuse to challenge him when he is wrong			2
‘ to get anything done you have to have priorities , and there are no priorities , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone is discouraged from telling the truth to important people			0
there ’s no grip , no focus			0
’ the incendiary claim will infuriate @entity31 , which is losing patience with mr @entity1 following a series of bruising rows that have damaged the government			1
earlier this month , mr @entity1 was forced to issue a written apology to mr @entity6 and a senior @entity38 official after briefing against @entity40 ’s approach to countering extremism in schools			1
in one of the worst bouts of @entity47 blood - letting , mrs may was forced to sacrifice her special adviser @entity48 after she leaked a letter in which mr @entity1 hit back at the home secretary			1
mr @entity2 , a frequent critic of the @entity47 , quit as mr @entity1 ’s special adviser in january but continues to visit the @entity52 to offer advice			1
friends describe the pair ’s continuing partnership as being ‘ like @entity57 ’			0
in an interview with the @entity59 , mr @entity2 said he regretted the fact that the government ’s education reforms had not moved ‘ faster , further , better ’			2
mr @entity2 , who had frequent rows with civil servants while in post , laid the blame for slow progress mainly on a ‘ dysfunctional ’ department			2

‘ everyone is trying to find the secret of @entity6 but he is exactly what he appears to be – there ’s no mystery to him			0
he had a picture of [ @entity84 ] @entity83 on his wall – that ’s all you need to know			0
’ mr @entity2 , who spent six years working alongside mr @entity1 , said many of the prime minister ’s most senior advisers were ‘ far out of their depth ’ , had ‘ no grip ’ and were out of touch			1
mr @entity6 ’s @entity94 chief of staff @entity95 was described as a ‘ classic third - rate suck - up - kick - down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court ’			2
mr @entity2 was also scathing about mr @entity6 ’s director of communications @entity99 , a former @entity101 journalist			1
the @entity1 and @entity6 families are close , but the prime minister is said to be becoming exasperated with his old friend ’s growing habit of becoming involved in unnecessary rows			2

but the personal and high - profile nature of his latest attack will cause anger			0
