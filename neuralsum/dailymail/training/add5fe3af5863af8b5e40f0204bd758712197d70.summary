in an era where the quest for eternal youth is never ending , we happily pop pills , down potions and spend a fortune on face cream			0
but would you be brave enough to drink your own urine if it made you look ten years younger ? one 91 - year - old man insists this home - brewed elixir is the key to his youthful appearance and active lifestyle			1
@entity17 , who ' lives in sin ' with his 87 - year - old partner @entity19 , in the south of @entity21 , sips his way through a tumbler of the liquid every day			1
elixir ? @entity17 , who ' lives in sin ' with his 87 - year - old partner @entity19 , sips his way through a tumber of his own urine every day			1
he believes this is the key to his youthful appearance and active lifestyle he also dabs it on wounds as he believes it can aid the healing process			1
mr @entity17 told @entity36 : ' @entity19 and i both have serious health problems which have to be coped with			1
' i have a badly damaged spine and she suffers from macular disease , knees that really need replacements and other complaints normally associated with elderly people			0
' nonetheless , we lead a very active life with friends saying i look a lot less than my age , and my partner possessing remarkable energy and looking no more than 65 - 70 years of age			1
' the former publicity director said : ' as far i 'm concerned , i am convinced that urine therapy , which i started practicing over three years ago , is mainly responsible for my younger appearance			1
' mr @entity17 admits he stumbled across the so - called fountain of youth by accident while searching the internet for a cure for back pain			1
he explained : ' i 'd already undergone three lumber operations in the @entity63 and in @entity21 with the specialists admitting they could do nothing more for me apart from trying out different painkilling medicines			0
mr @entity17 also dabs urine on wounds as he believes it can aid the healing process ' with nothing to lose , i thought i 'd try the therapy to help to obtain a better quality of life for my remaining years			1
' he eagerly began researching what needed to be done - but could find nothing about when or how much to drink			0
while the practice might sound abhorrent , mr @entity17 is n't alone - in fact , urine therapy is said to date back to the @entity81			1
historical documents suggest that the @entity83 disinfected wounds with it , while the benefits are also mentioned in @entity88 and @entity89 literature			1
urine is highly sterile , consisting of water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins , vitamins and minerals			2
advocates of urine therapy believe these excreted ingredients have health benefits ranging from a boosted immune system to eye and ear drops			1
undeterred , and armed with this knowledge , mr @entity17 he decided to adopt the trial and error approach			1
he recalls : ' taking a small sample in a small glass – easier for a male than a female , i guess – i gingerly tasted the perfectly clear , amber - coloured liquid			2
' not too bad , i thought - a peculiar taste , nothing like anything i ’ve had before			0
not pleasant , but on the other hand , not too awful			0
' determined to continue , over the next few days he kept tasting his urine until he was brave enough to drink some			2
' taking a small sample in a small glass , i gingerly tasted the perfectly clear , amber - coloured liquid			0
' not too bad , i thought - a peculiar taste , nothing like anything i ’ve had before			0
not pleasant , but on the other hand , not too awful ' starting with just a sip , he began drinking a little almost every time he went to the loo , gradually increasing the amount as the weeks went by , building up to a tumbler			2
and the secret to it not leaving a nasty after - taste ? a grape or two , or a quick rinse of the mouth with water , ' he confesses			0
three years on , he 's also become somewhat of an expert on how one 's bodily fluids should appear			0
' i learnt that one should note the colour of one ’s water and drink it if it ’s mid-stream and a definite straw - colour			0
' but forget sipping on the pale stuff			0
' if it 's clear then it 's practically tasteless - and i think pretty useless as a healing agent , ' he instructs			0
at the other end of the scale , the elixir can also be a bit too strong to handle			2
' if it 's a deep amber colour veering towards yellow , it looks beautiful but it 's a bit too strong for me to take , despite it 's potential benefits			2
' mr @entity17 ( with @entity19 ) admits he stumbled across the practice by accident while searching the internet for a cure for back pain			1
he said : ' with nothing to lose , i thought i 'd try the therapy to help to obtain a better quality of life for my remaining years ' but what are the benefits ? mr @entity17 says his research has shown that ' only five per cent of urine contains health - giving vitamins which will certainly strengthen one ’s own immune system '			1
and how much does he drink in total ? ' half a small glassful as many times as i can during a normal day ' - equating to about a tumbler a day			2
but it does n't stop there			0
he also massages the elixir into skin , believing it can be ' very effective healing problems on the face , arms and legs and even eyelids and ears , by massaging the affected areas with urine which can be fresh or a day or two old '			1
he said : ' i think i look and feel about ten years younger than my age			0
i often get up early and do some brain training work on the computer , then cheerfully wake up @entity19 with a morning cup of tea ' but he stresses that persistence is needed			2
' firm massaging of affected areas with urine can sometimes be needed for weeks on even months before healing is complete			2
' so , three years on , does he feel better ? ' i still find it very difficult and painful to walk upright and i have to take a couple of painkillers a day to keep active			0
' however , i firmly believe that the urine therapy helps to reduce the spinal column nerve pains to an acceptable level - and it does n’t cost a bean ! but despite his best attempts , mr @entity17 ca n't convince partner @entity19 ( pictured ) to join his quest for eternal youth ' the rest of my body is in pretty good shape , with many friends and even strangers remarking how well i look			1
' ' i think i look and feel about ten years younger than my age			0
i possess a @entity21 driving licence up to 2014 , i do all the cooking , i belong to a bridge club which i helped to start 20 years ago ; and i ’m learning to play the piano whenever i can because i never had the chance when i was younger			0
' the morning ca n’t come quickly enough for me and i often get up early and do some brain train work on the computer , then cheerfully wake up my partner with her morning cup of tea			0
' because i can memorise the words of almost a 100 songs , @entity19 encourages me to sing two or three of them before getting up and making the bed			2
' this is an excellent therapy for me and i ’m then ready to make the most of the remainder of the day			2
' he thoroughly believes that drinking urine is responsible for much of this well - being attitude			1
' in fact , i feel that life for me would not be worth living without it , ' he says			1
but while @entity19 is impressed with the fruits of his efforts , he says she ' finds it impossible to overcome her feelings of repugnance at the very thought of drinking her own urine '			1
' she has resisted all my attempts to persuade her to try the urine therapy , ' he admits			1
urine therapy is said to date back to the @entity81			1
historical documents suggest that the @entity83 disinfected wounds with it , while the benefits are also mentioned in @entity88 and @entity89 literature			2
urine is highly sterile , consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins , vitamins and minerals			0
during the digestive process , the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted			0
the blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine			0
but gp dr @entity272 said : ' over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine , but as far as i 'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back - up these claims			1
' the kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body does n't need , so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive			0
' personally , i believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking , eating a healthy diet , and keeping stress under control			0

believes the health and appearance benefits are so strong that without the therapy , ' life would not be worth living '
