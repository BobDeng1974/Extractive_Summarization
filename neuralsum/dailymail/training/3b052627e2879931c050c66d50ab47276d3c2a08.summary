by @entity1 reporter published : 20:40 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 4 october 2012 when firefighters got a call asking them to pump 20,000 litres of water at an art gallery , they may have expected to find a serious case of flooding when they arrived			1
but the crews were actually needed to help create a work of art which , unusually , required the water to be pumped into the first floor of the building			0
now the only way to get about the room at @entity17 's @entity16 arts centre is to walk on pieces of a 150 - year - old tree , arranged in the water like stepping stones			1
it is based on a movie by renowned @entity38 filmmaker @entity37 entitled @entity51 , which was never released but is thought to have inspired @entity41 's hit @entity42 the extra weight of the water on the art centre is estimated to be almost 20 tonnes and the building 's architects had to be consulted before the project could begin			1
the logs on the water are remnants of a @entity32 fir tree from @entity62 's @entity61 , which had to be felled due to an invasive fungus			1
preparations : firefighters from the @entity66 fill the exhibition space with water from a nearby hydrant			2
the building 's architects had to be consulted beforehand felled : the logs on the water are remnants of a @entity32 fir tree from @entity62 's @entity61 @entity74 , of the @entity75 , told the @entity76 at the time : ' as with all trees that have to be removed as part of the management of @entity61 's tree collection , this historic @entity32 wo n't be wasted			1
' @entity61 's trees go on to become a multitude of things , from woodcraft , tables and flooring to woodchip for the arboretum 's paths , but this is the first time we have linked with a major art exhibition			0
' we are all excited to see how the installation will look			0
' visitors will get the chance to see how the installation looks when the display opens on saturday			0
it is due to run until january 6			0
a series of talks , screenings and events will accompany the exhibition			0
necessary : the tree , from @entity62 's @entity61 , had to be felled due to an invasive fungus timber ! the tree comes down at @entity62 's @entity61 , ready to play an important role in the art exhibition video : and this was the tree that was felled especially !			2
