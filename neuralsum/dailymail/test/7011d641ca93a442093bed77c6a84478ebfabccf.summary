the news that @entity1 will leave @entity2 in the summer has raised the probability that key members of his squad will depart too			1
@entity1 has painstakingly built a team in his image during his seven - year tenure at the @entity9 and achieved considerable success			0
@entity2 were @entity11 champions in 2011 and 2012 before they reached the final of the @entity13 in 2013			0
@entity1 has announced he is to quit @entity2 at the end of the season @entity1 has enjoyed seven successful seasons at the @entity9 but has decided to call time but the signings of @entity19 and @entity20 helped @entity21 re-establish their dominance and @entity1 's exit is the end of an era			2
it could signal the break - up of the @entity2 squad and we take a look at four players who could follow @entity1 out of the club this summer			1
@entity33 even before @entity1 's shock announcement , it looked highly likely that @entity33 would be leaving at the end of the season , most likely to @entity37			2
the @entity40 @entity39 - winner is considered one of the best defenders in the game and would add steel to any back line			0
@entity1 revealed recently that @entity33 , 26 , had been ' thinking things over , ' adding that he believed he was good enough for @entity37			2
defender @entity33 has been linked with a move to @entity37 this summer @entity47 the 24 - year - old midfielder has also been linked with a summer move to the @entity50 , with @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 among those interested			1
at his best , @entity47 can take control of a midfield battle and is more than capable of unlocking defences with his range of passing			0
he hinted in february that he was ready to sign a new contract but then stalled and @entity1 's departure could make up his mind for him			0
midfielder @entity47 has been linked with a number of @entity50 sides @entity66 the @entity68 striker only arrived at the @entity9 from @entity69 last summer but has n't lived up to expectations as @entity20 's replacement			1
a measly return of 10 goals for the season has hardly compensated for the loss of their star striker to @entity21 last summer			0
there have been suggestions that @entity2 will listen to offers for @entity66 and he would most likely return home to @entity83 , perhaps to @entity84			2
@entity66 ( left ) has struggled to compensate for @entity20 's departure to @entity21 @entity86 the @entity88 defender had ears burning in the @entity50 when he said last week that he wo n't decide his @entity2 future until after his summer holidays			1
he also added they he yearns to play in a league that is more physical , saying : ' how can i do my work when my opponent starts crying without contact ? ' @entity86 has been linked with @entity37 and @entity51 , offering a possible alternative if @entity33 does n't want to make the move			1
