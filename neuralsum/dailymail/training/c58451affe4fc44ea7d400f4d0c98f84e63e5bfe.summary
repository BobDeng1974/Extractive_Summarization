the @entity0 have launched an investigation into allegations that @entity4 referee @entity3 was subjected to homophobic abuse by a small section of the @entity8 crowd during @entity10 ’s loss to @entity11 on saturday			1
a claim was made on wednesday that @entity3 , who came out in 2007 , was subjected to ‘ disgusting vitriol ’ by one member of the crowd and the sport ’s governing body has promised to investigate			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity0 condemns all forms of discrimination and aims to ensure that all people , irrespective of their age , gender , ability , race , religion , ethnic origin , creed , colour , nationality , social status or sexual orientation , have a genuine and equal opportunity to enjoy rugby union in whatever form , on or off the pitch , at all levels and in all roles			0
referee @entity3 ( left ) is one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby ' as a lifelong rugby fan , a straight man in his 60s , i could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty , foul - mouthed , racist , homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official , ' @entity51 , from @entity52 , wrote in a letter to @entity54 on wednesday			1
' my equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him , hearing this vitriol , was a little boy			1
' ‘ we take any allegations of any abuse very seriously and are investigating this matter			1
’ a national newspaper received a letter of complaint regarding an individual ’s behaviour during the game in which the fellow spectator complained about abuse directed at @entity3 , who considered suicide as a young man before coming out			1
@entity3 said : ‘ if someone has gone to the trouble to send a letter to the paper and say that this was disgusting and the behaviour was totally out of order , then i would think what they shouted was pretty bad and if that is the case then these people should be banned from the game			1
‘ they need to be told that some behaviour is not acceptable , that crossing the line of what is humour and banter is a fine line but if you cross it then you have to put up with the consequences			0
’ @entity3 , a role model for the gay community as one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby , is widely considered to be one of the world ’s best referees			1
he added : ‘ what has become more evident is that while we may not be so aware of it on the field , i think we become more aware of it now through social media			0
the @entity4 official is widely considered to be one of the world ’s best referees ‘ when you see things that are tweeted by so - called rugby supporters about opposition teams and some of the tweets that i have had , you begin thinking , “ bloody hell , are these type of people really in our game ? ” ‘ i have had homophobic tweets and messages on @entity125 from people who are shouting things that i could not repeat in your newspaper			1
‘ it is creeping into the game and some of the tweets i have had are pretty nasty , really			1
‘ sometimes you get these comments and read these tweets and you think , “ do i really need this ? do i really need to do this job ? ” ‘ it does get you down and i honestly feel sometimes like saying : ‘ enough is enough , i will walk away from it all			0
’ @entity3 has vowed to carry on and will take charge of @entity136 against @entity137 this weekend ‘ but then you get support from people and it makes you realise these are the minority and you have to pick yourself up and rise above it			1
it is not always easy to do that but you have to do it and get on			0
‘ i do n’t think it is a huge problem in rugby but i think it is an increasing problem as last saturday has proved			2
‘ people have said when i came out i would be a role model to young people who are dealing with becoming who they are within rugby and other sports and i understand that now			2
‘ but the people who do more good are not myself but are the people like @entity51 ( who highlighted the abuse in a letter to the media ) who stood up to these louts			2
‘ they are the true , genuine rugby people who can make a difference more than i can			0
a fan sparked the @entity0 probe by claiming he was ' ashamed ' at the abuse aimed at @entity3 ‘ i ’d be lying if i said it did n’t affect me — you get disappointed and down when you see it			1
it gets to you but you have to go out there and prove them wrong			0
it ’s about showing your character			0
you want to show them they wo n’t push you out of the game you adore			0
‘ we are only human and when people say horrible things about you , it gets in your mind			0
‘ but it ’s also about setting an example to those coming through the system			2
you want to show them you stood up for yourself and got through it			0
‘ i could n’t go out and do my job as a referee if comments made by fans or anyone else got to me			2
i ’ve had it since i started as a referee , but for a player it ’s different			2
‘ they ’re not used to putting up with that stuff from supporters — it ’s totally unacceptable			0
i ’ve had to take abuse as a referee and in my case it was a little different			1
‘ i ’m refereeing @entity136 against @entity137 this weekend which is a massive game			0
and i need to stick two fingers up to those who shouted abuse at me			2
i need to go out there and prove them wrong			0
