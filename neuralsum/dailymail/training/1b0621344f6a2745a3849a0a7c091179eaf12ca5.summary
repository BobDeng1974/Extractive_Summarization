the aristocratic @entity14 family successfully argued that a painting they sold for £ 9.4 million was part of ‘ plant and machinery ’ at their stately home and therefore a ‘ wasting asset ’ exempt from capital gains tax ( @entity24 )			1
the family said the picture by 18th century @entity27 painter sir @entity2 had been put on display to attract visitors and so was declining in value for tax purposes			1
wealthy aristocrats , nightclub owners and high - end restaurant chains are all eyeing the new tax break that could save them millions of pounds when they sell treasured collectors ’ items			2
the painting – a depiction of @entity3 , a @entity41 who spent two years in @entity27 in the 1770s after being picked up by @entity45 ’s ship adventure – was sold at @entity46 in 2001			1
the @entity47 , whose @entity49 home was the setting for @entity53 ’s 1981 adaptation of @entity55 ’s classic @entity54 , had been arguing with the taxman ever since			0
but this month ’s @entity58 judgment determined that there was no @entity24 due on the sale of the painting			2
mr @entity62 said : ‘ i accept that there is something surprising in holding that an asset of high value , and one liable to appreciate in value , with a predicted life of more than 50 years , was a wasting asset			1
‘ however , the painting was only a wasting asset because it satisfied the established test			1
’ @entity73 had argued that if famous paintings could be treated as plant , it would create a huge loophole for tax avoidance			1
@entity14 and his wife @entity78 successfully argued that the £ 9.4 ¿ million painting was part of ¿ plant and machinery ¿ at their stately home and therefore a ¿ wasting asset ¿ exempt from capital gains tax officials are now considering the judgment			1

‘ we will be raising it with our clients , many of whom have valuable paintings , ’ said @entity91 , a tax adviser at accountancy firm @entity93			2
‘ people will be looking to locate artwork where it is a part of their business			2
’ mr @entity91 said the ruling could have wide implications			0
‘ supposing somebody bought a @entity107 guitar			0
if you hang it on the wall of your nightclub , it ’s there for the ambience , ’ he said			0

it is not clear how much @entity24 the @entity14 family will avoid through the ruling			0
the painting was acquired by @entity124 , the 5th @entity125 , in the 1790s			0
mr @entity91 said the case showed that tax rules are a muddle			0
‘ the painting was not caught for capital gains tax because it was treated as a wasting asset			1
' a valuable painting is almost certainly going to survive for more than 50 years and rise in value			0

’ a spokesman for the @entity14 family said : ‘ for many years the painting had been on display to visitors			0
