it is considered the villain of the animal kingdom - a pilferer obsessed with stealing trinkets			0
but it appears the magpie has been unfairly maligned all along			0
for despite its centuries - old reputation , new research suggests that the bird is not attracted to shiny objects after all			1
in fact , as animal psychologists have discovered , magpies are actually quite repelled by unfamiliar items			1
psychologists from the @entity15 discovered that , contrary to popular belief , magpies ( stock image pictured ) are actually frightened of new and unfamiliar objects , rather than attracted to them the idea of the magpie as a pilferer that steals sparkly items for its nest is a common theme in @entity29 folklore			1
@entity30 made it the theme of his 1817 opera @entity33 , in which a servant girl is executed for stealing silver jewellery that had been pinched by a bird			0
suspicion of the bird is common in folklore and myth			0
in western @entity29 and @entity42 magpies are often thought to be bearers of bad omens , and associated with the devil			0
negative connotations surrounding magpies can be traced back to @entity48 , when their ' chattering ' was referenced , and moaned about			0
other myths claim the birds were the only ones not to join @entity54 on the ark. superstitious people will often salute and greet a magpie to avoid experiencing bad luck			1
the @entity64 comic ‘ @entity63 ’ has a similar plot , in which a prized emerald stolen by a magpie			0
but scientists at the @entity15 have now debunked the myth , proving that magpies are not the flighty thieves we thought they were			1
the researchers carried out a series of tests on wild magpies and a group of the birds housed at a rescue centre			1
under carefully controlled conditions , they were exposed to both shiny and non-shiny items and their reactions recorded			1
lead researcher dr @entity80 , from the university ’s @entity81 in @entity83 , said : ‘ we did not find evidence of an unconditional attraction to shiny objects in magpies			1
‘ instead , all objects prompted responses indicating neophobia - fear of new things			0
‘ we suggest that humans notice when magpies occasionally pick up shiny objects because they believe the birds find them attractive , while it goes unnoticed when magpies interact with less eye - catching items			1
‘ it seems likely , therefore , that the folklore surrounding them is a result of cultural generalisation and anecdotes rather than evidence			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity108 , used shiny metal screws , small foil rings and aluminium foil			0
the researchers carried out a series of experiments with both a group of magpies which had come from a rescue centre , and wild magpies in the grounds of the university ( pictured )			2
magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests			1
both times a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded half the screws and rings were painted matt blue while the rest retained their original silvery shine			0
in the experiments , shiny and non-shiny objects were placed on the ground 11 inches ( 30cm ) from a pile of food in the form of nuts			2
wild magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests , the researchers reported			1
on both occasions , a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded			0
both the shiny and blue objects were either ignored or avoided			2
often , the magpies exhibited wary behaviour by feeding less when the items were nearby			2
during the study with captive birds , no contact was made with any of the objects			2
co-author dr @entity149 said : ‘ surprisingly little research has investigated the cognitive mechanisms of magpie behaviour			0
‘ similarly to other large - brained members of the crow family with complex social systems , magpies are capable of sophisticated mental feats , such as mirror self - recognition , retrieval of hidden objects and remembering where and when they have hoarded what food item			2
‘ instead of being compulsively drawn towards shiny objects , magpies decide to keep a safe distance when these objects are novel and unexpected			1

psychologists from @entity15 carried out tests on magpie groups
the found that , contrary to popular belief , the birds do *n't* like shiny objects
in fact , the magpies studied were frightened of new and unfamiliar items
