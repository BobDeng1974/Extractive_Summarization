the world 's longest neutrino experiment has begun its probe into the mysteries of ' ghostly ' particles that may hold the key to understanding the universe			1
the machine , called @entity8 , is made up of two huge detectors – placed 500 miles ( 800km ) apart – to study one of nature 's most elusive subatomic particles			1
scientists believe that a better understanding of neutrinos , one of the most abundant and difficult - to - study particles , may lead to a clearer picture of the inner workings of the universe			1
tiny and nearly mass-less , neutrinos are everywhere and about 100 trillion pass through us harmlessly each second			1
they were created by the @entity39 and form in the sun and our own bodies , but they move so fast and small that scientists have barely detected them for study			2
' of the known particles , the neutrinos as a group are the most oddball , ' said @entity48 of the @entity49 , @entity49			2
neutrinos are a group because they come in three types , or " flavours " , and they can shift from one type to another , but scientists do n't quite know why			2
@entity8 's particle detectors were constructed in the path of the neutrino beam sent from @entity32 in @entity58 , @entity59 to @entity60			1
pictured is a view across the top of the @entity65 detector in @entity66 , @entity60 neutrinos interact so weakly with other matter that billions of them pass through our bodies every second without leaving a trace			0
they are the most mysterious of the known particles in the universe and could help unravel huge mysteries , such as why the cosmos is made of matter			1
but these elusive particles may also help scientists solve puzzles closer to home - including where exactly nuclear weapons are being made			1
scientists at the @entity86 at @entity87 are investigating just how accurate neutrinos are when detecting nuclear activity			0
it follows previous studies , such as a project by @entity93 and @entity94 , that created prototype neutrino detectors to sniff out nuclear weapons			0
neutrinos are produced by the decay of radioactive elements , and nuclear reactors produce large amounts of neutrinos that can not be shielded or disguised			0
measuring neutrino emissions allows scientists to know the plutonium content of a reactor from outside the building , according to the researchers			0
' by making moderate improvements in existing neutrino - detector technology , we can fit a detector system into a standard 20ft ( 7 metre ) shipping container to monitor the @entity116 heavy water reactor at @entity117 as part of a non-proliferation measure , ' said @entity120 , an associate professor of physics at @entity122 if a neutrino is eventually beamed from @entity33 , ' it starts out as a chocolate milkshake , but it 's partly strawberry by the time it gets to @entity128 , ' said @entity129 , a particle theorist at @entity131 neutrinos could give scientists clues about the mysterious dark matter of outer space and other strange astrophysical phenomena			1
@entity8 's particle detectors were both constructed in the path of the neutrino beam sent from @entity32 in @entity58 , @entity59 , to northern @entity60			1
the 300 - ton near detector , installed underground at the laboratory , observes the neutrinos as they embark on their near - light - speed journey through the @entity145			0
the 14,000 - ton far detector spots those neutrinos after their 500 - mile trip and allows scientists to analyse how they change over that long distance			2
for the next six years , @entity32 will send tens of thousands of billions of neutrinos every second in a beam aimed at both detectors , and scientists expect to catch only a few each day in the far detector , so rarely do neutrinos interact with matter			2
from this data , scientists hope to learn more about how and why neutrinos change between one type and another			0
the far detector in @entity60 is believed to be the largest free - standing plastic structure in the world , at 200ft ( 60 metres ) long , 50ft ( 15 metres ) high and 50ft ( 15 metres ) wide			0
both detectors are constructed from pvc and filled with a scintillating liquid that gives off light when a neutrino interacts with it			0
fiber optic cables transmit that light to a computer , which creates 3d pictures of those interactions for scientists to analyse			0
scientists will also probe the still - unknown masses of the three types of neutrinos in an attempt to determine which is the heaviest			2
this massive pivoting machine moves one block of the @entity8 far detector across the hall in @entity66 , @entity60 , to connect it with the rest of the detector			0

@entity8 is made up of two huge detectors placed 500 miles ( 800km ) apart
it will study neutrinos - one of nature 's most elusive subatomic particles
@entity8 , near @entity33 , will generate world 's most powerful neutrino beam
about 100 trillion neutrinos pass through us harmlessly each second
