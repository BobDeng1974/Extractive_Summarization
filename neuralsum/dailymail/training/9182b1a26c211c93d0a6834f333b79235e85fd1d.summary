by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:49 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 20:52 est , 5 november 2013 sheep should be put out to graze on council - owned parks and fields to save the cost of mowers , town hall chiefs were advised yesterday			1
cows and sheep could cut the grass without the expense of petrol , mowing machines and workers to drive them , a report said			2
and it also recommended sending children in care to boarding schools rather than expecting them to live in care homes			0
suggestion : a report from the @entity24 has suggested sheep could be put out to graze on council - owned parks and fields to save the cost of mowers school ties : the report also recommended sending children in care to boarding schools , which would be cheaper than expecting them to live in care homes the advice said independent schools would be better and cheaper than the care homes and care units used by local authorities , where costs to taxpayers can often rise higher than the fees of the most expensive public schools			1
the report also called for parking wardens to be made to pay to park their own cars when they drive to work			0
they should have to pay the price for using taxpayer - run car parks in just the same way as the shoppers and commuters whose cars they ticket , it said			1
recommendations : communities secretary @entity57 urged town halls to follow the advice according to the report from the @entity62 pressure group , local authority employees could also contribute in 198 other ways to keeping council tax bills down			1
ideas for saving money run from replacing bottled mineral water in meetings with tap water to sacking staff who abuse their taxpayer - backed official credit cards			1
councils , it said , should remove road humps and speed cameras , stop town twinning schemes , sack their climate change officers , and scrap the lady mayoress ’ clothing allowance			0
they should also consider saving money by encouraging council tenants to do their own repairs			2
the 201 ideas were put forward by the public spending pressure group the @entity62 with the aim of nudging councils towards giving better value for money			1
it warned that unless local authorities draw up schemes to cut waste there will be growing pressure for increases in council tax , which has already doubled in a decade			2
an average @entity100 bill in @entity101 is now £ 1,456 a year			0
the list of ideas was drawn up by @entity104 , a @entity105 councillor in @entity106 and @entity107 in @entity108 , who said it included items that ‘ could be shrugged off as mere common sense - missing the point that common sense is a rare and precious commodity in local government			0
’ communities secretary @entity57 urged town halls to follow the advice			1
‘ this report exposes how there is still massive waste in the public sector , ’ mr @entity57 said			2
‘ there is significant scope for town halls to save taxpayers ’ money , helping keep council tax down and protect frontline services			1
councils which complain about so - called cuts need to read through this report and justify their spending to local taxpayers			2
central government could learn many a practical tip from this too			0
’ @entity129 , the money - saving tip sheet said , could get rid of political advisers , freeze staff recruitment , and reduce the number of their press officers to match the number of reporters on their local newspapers			2
if they do have to recruit , they can save money by advertising on their own websites rather than in the @entity149			1
they should stop paying for translators , diversity officers , fair trade co-ordinators , five - a - day co-ordinators , work experience co-ordinators , and @entity156 officers			0
they could then save money by cancelling frivolous award ceremonies organised to make pointless staff think they have achieved something			1
there should also be an end to subscriptions for strings of umbrella organisations , including the @entity166 , which charges some councils as much as £ 80,000 a year for membership			0
councils should withdraw funding from ‘ sock puppet ’ charities - fake charities which exist to promote political agendas and which rely on taxpayer subsidies			2
mr @entity104 said : ‘ some items , such as outsourcing , sharing services and debt interest reduction , can each amount to tens or even hundreds of millions of pounds in annual savings for larger local authorities			0
‘ this amounts to more than a checklist			0
it is trying to engender an attitude of getting value for taxpayers ’ money			0
’ the ideas were condemned by the union unite			0
the union , which includes council workers among its members , said it would be dangerous for tenants to try to carry out their own electrical repairs			0
unite local government officer @entity198 said : ‘ the credibility of the @entity62 ’ @entity24 has to be seriously questioned when ideas taken from medieval times , such as grazing sheep , are wheeled out in its endless quest for publicity			1
‘ has the @entity24 worked out how much it is going to cost to buy these animals and pay the substantial veterinary bills ? ‘ the prospect we face is hundreds of these animals freely roaming around municipal parks ignoring health and safety considerations when children are playing - and being a prime target for urban rustlers			1
