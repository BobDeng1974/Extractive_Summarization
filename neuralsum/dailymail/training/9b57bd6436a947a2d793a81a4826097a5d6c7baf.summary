from the forest elephants of @entity2 , to @entity4 ’s tigers and even our own great white sharks , wildlife is losing the battle for survival all over the world			1
human activity has been blamed for the plummet in numbers , as the @entity13 reports dwindling populations of bumblebees and polar bears - and one of the world 's biggest decreases in sealife			1
our ever - growing need for land and resources , coupled with hunting and poaching , has halved the number of wild animals in world in just 40 years , according to a shocking report			1
the @entity30 by @entity31 and the @entity32 has found that wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970			1
the authors compiled data on 10,380 animal populations , including 3,038 different species , as an index to judge how global wildlife is faring as a whole			2
in the @entity13 , fish have decreased by 83 per cent between 1970 and 2010 - the second largest drop after @entity45 which lost 86 per cent in the same period			1
@entity13 amphibians have also struggled in the modern world , with an overall decline of 73 per cent recorded , while the total number of reptiles dropped by 48 per cent nationwide			1
the great white shark is one of the @entity13 ' worst - affected species , having lost around 50 per cent of its population in just 20 years , largely due to oil spills in the ocean			1
endangered : the population of great white sharks has decreased by around 50 per cent in just 20 years due to a number of factors including oil spills in the ocean worldwide problem : the common sight of monarch butterflies could soon be a distant memory as the population has plummeted almost 90 per cent in just 20 years little brown bats continue to plummet in numbers due to white - nose syndrome , which has killed seven million since 2006			1
in some states , the population has decreased by 99 per cent			0
the syndrome infects the bat 's body causing its organs to go cold and its heart to slow			0
experts are still struggling to determine the cause			0
the number of rusty - patched bumblebees - crucial pollinators - haven disappeared from 87 per cent of their territory in the past 25 years , and monarch butterflies are down 90 per cent in the same period			2
the global picture is worst for freshwater creatures such as amphibians , river fish and mammals , with average population declines of 76 per cent between 1970 and 2010 , says the latest data available			2
land - dwelling animals declined by 39 per cent over the same period and sea creatures fell 39 per cent , the report found			1
the authors said the main threats to wildlife are loss or damage to their habitat and exploitation through hunting and fishing			0
closer to home : animals are dying out across the @entity13 too , including the mountain yellow - legged frog , which has been threatened by farming on its habitat crucial : the rusty - patched bumblebee is a key pollinator in the ecosystem but it has disappeared from 87 % of its territories due to disease and pesticides they also warned that humans are using resources faster than the planet can provide , cutting down forests too quickly , overfishing and pumping out pollution faster than the world can cope with it			1
around 3.9 planets - worth of land and resources would be needed to sustain the typical @entity13 lifestyle as it is today for an extended period of time			2
@entity133 had the biggest ecological footprint , meaning they consume and waste more resources per head than any other nation , the report said , followed by @entity138 and the @entity139			0
@entity45 came eighth in the list , behind @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145			0
professor @entity146 , director of science at @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said : ‘ the scale of biodiversity loss and damage to the very ecosystems that are essential to our existence is alarming			0
this damage is not inevitable , but a consequence of the way we choose to live			0
’ @entity158 , chief executive of @entity31 , said : ‘ the scale of destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake - up call to us all			2
we all have an interest , and a responsibility , to act to ensure we protect what we all value : a healthy future for both people and nature			0
’ under the sea : the threat to our wildlife is not just limited to land animals - the short - nosed common dolphin and leatherback turtle are also dying out mr @entity158 said consumers could reduce their impact on wildlife by choosing products which were sustainable , for example fish with the @entity182 and timber with the @entity185 certifications			2
he said that they could also look at reducing their meat and dairy consumption			0
professor @entity190 , director of conservation programmes at @entity32 , said people should think about everything they do , from recycling to putting pressure on political and industry leaders , and getting their children outside to reconnect with nature .			0

@entity201 's need for land and resources , *combined* with hunting and poaching , are causing our wild animals to die out
wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970 , a new report has found
the likes of forest elephants , *african* lions and tigers are under threat , as well as @entity13 sharks
@entity222 numbers dropped 90 % in 40 years , tigers by 97 % in 100 years and elephants *60* % since 2002 , @entity31 reported
