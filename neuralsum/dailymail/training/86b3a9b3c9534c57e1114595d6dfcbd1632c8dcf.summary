in a stadium named after a company built on duty - free shopping , @entity0 watched two points disappear while weighing up the value of one final dash to the tills before the gate closes			2
at the @entity10 there was no late goal from @entity12 as there has been twice already this season , and no one stepping up to support the manager ’s theory that he has the strike options to survive the long haul			1
@entity20 was on target with his second goal in five days to put the visitors ahead but the lead lasted only two minutes			1
booked : @entity35 , @entity47 , @entity48 @entity60 : 7 @entity12 : @entity61 6.5 ; @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 6 ( @entity65 26 , 6.5 ) , @entity33 6.5 ; @entity37 7 , @entity66 6.5 ; @entity20 7 , @entity67 6 , @entity41 6.5 ( @entity68 77 , 6.5 ) ; @entity69 5 ( @entity70 77 , 5 ) subs : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 wenger : 6 @entity52 quickly levelled for @entity31 , who proved they are ready to compete in the @entity78			1
@entity60 ’s team were aggressive , committed and dangerous on the break as they were roared on by a boisterous home crowd			0
they are yet to win and they conceded long spells of possession to the visitors but they have taken two points which may be vital from a tough trio of fixtures against @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity12 and supporters filed out feeling positive about the campaign ahead			1
‘ we did n’t feel particularly threatened , ’ said @entity60 , and @entity0 agreed his team had lacked creativity and sharpness while over- complicating their approach play			0
@entity12 are yet to find any fluency this season			1
they needed a winner in stoppage time to beat @entity104 on opening day and a late equaliser by @entity106 , before he suffered the injury which will rule him out until the new year , at @entity91 last week			0
still , @entity0 remains reluctant to make a hasty call on signing a new centre forward when he has @entity20 , @entity39 , @entity70 and @entity75			1
@entity69 started up front but with little joy other than to assist with the opener in the 20th minute , when @entity31 allowed @entity12 too much space around their penalty box			1
@entity37 rolled a square pass to @entity41 , who scooped the ball forward			1
@entity69 turned and poked an unconvincing effort at goal and , as @entity43 sprang from his line to block the shot , the rebound spun to @entity20 , who crashed it in from close range			2
two minutes later , @entity31 were level when @entity64 misjudged @entity50 ’s cross from the left and @entity52 applied a firm header to beat @entity61 with his second goal of the season			1
@entity130 opened arsenal up for the @entity132 opener : the @entity134 makes no mistake from just outside the six - yard box immediate : @entity52 rises above a struggling @entity64 to level for @entity31 straight away vital : it was @entity52 's second @entity78 goal since joining from @entity141 side @entity140 this summer thorn in the side : @entity46 was a constant threat as @entity31 more than matched @entity12 in the first half @entity0 attributed the goal to @entity64 , who he said was uncomfortable after suffering a cut in an accidental clash of heads with @entity50 when the game was still goalless			1
@entity64 went off to have the wound tended but continued to have problems			0
‘ if he was n’t injured , we would n’t have conceded the goal , ’ said the @entity12 boss			2
‘ he was not concussed			0
he was cut on the top of his head			0
maybe he did n’t feel comfortable heading the ball after that			0
’ @entity64 came off soon afterwards , although he will be fit by the time his team are back in action , against @entity160 on saturday week			0
there were other injury scares for the @entity163 , one of which will concern @entity167 manager @entity166			0
@entity168 hobbled off at the end and @entity67 went down after twisting his right ankle and immediately signalled to be replaced before realising three substitutes had already been used			0
both @entity67 and @entity168 soldiered on but @entity12 found no way through @entity31 ’s defence			1
@entity52 was guilty of missing the clearest chance to win the game early in the second half , when he twisted clear of @entity177 inside the area and deceived @entity61 only to clip his shot into the side - netting			1
diving in : @entity181 and @entity48 both show their studs competing for the ball nervy bench : @entity0 watches on in the second half as his side struggle to break down @entity31 ‘ he will be disappointed not to finish that one , ’ said @entity60			2
‘ but it was super skill from him and he ’s proved already he has the capability to perform at this level			0
’ @entity52 was untidy at times but physical and made life awkward for @entity12 ’s central defenders			1
in many ways he typified what @entity31 did well			2
they surrendered much possession but unsettled @entity0 ’s team on the break and kept going to the end			0
@entity61 saved from @entity51 in the closing stages and @entity203 fizzed a low drive wide			2
as ever , it was @entity37 who drove @entity12 on , seemingly the only one able to inject any urgency into the passing sequences			1
even so , he failed to take advantage when @entity41 picked out one of his forward runs and clipped the ball on to his head			0
@entity37 seemed caught between going for goal and nodding down towards @entity69			2
in the end , he headed tamely at @entity43 , who also saved at full stretch from @entity69 , a striker whom @entity0 conceded had seen his confidence hit by the 17 - game wait for his first competitive @entity12 goal			2
‘ if you play up front and you do n’t score it ’s very quickly a problem , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ he did find it very hard , and he did n’t score			0
yes , it is on his mind , of course			0
’ golden chance : @entity39 had an opportunity to score his first competitive goal , but @entity43 saved blocked off : @entity50 stops @entity20 getting a cross in , during a competitive clash			1

@entity20 put @entity12 ahead after 20 minutes
@entity52 equalizes two minutes later
@entity52 and @entity51 miss *excellent* chances to win it for @entity31
@entity37 and @entity39 miss @entity12 's best opportunities
