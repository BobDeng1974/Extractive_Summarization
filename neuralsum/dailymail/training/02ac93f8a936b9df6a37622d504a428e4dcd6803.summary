@entity1 gun laws are careful not to deny firearm permits to any resident based on physical disability , even if they ’re legally blind			1
blind applicants are allowed under state law to purchase weapons and carry them in public , even if they are n’t allowed to hold a driver ’s license or are unable to read the application form			1
while some sheriffs have been granting gun permits to people with visual impairments , others have been denying them despite a 2011 law that gives blanket rights to hold such permits to all physically disabled @entity19			1
shoot ' em up : an @entity22 law that gives blanket rights to carry guns to otherwise eligible physically disabled persons is forcing county sheriffs to issue permits to the blind ‘ it seems a little strange , but the way the law reads , we ca n’t deny them ( a permit ) just based on that one thing , ’ sergeant @entity29 , a spokeswoman for the @entity31 sheriff ’s office , told the @entity32			1
county officials said they have issued at least three permits to people who ca n’t legally drive and had trouble reading the application			2
other counties have also issue permits , while others have not			0
‘ i ’m not an expert in vision , ’ @entity48 sheriff @entity47 said			0
‘ at what point do vision problems have a detrimental effect to fire a firearm ? if you see nothing but a blurry mass in front of you , then i would say you probably should n’t be shooting something			0
’ getting technical : even if the person ca n't drive a car or even read the permit application , the word of the law grants them the right to apply for a gun permit helpless : some @entity69 sheriffs have acquiesced to the laws , while others have not			1
' we can ¿ t deny them ( a permit ) just based on that one thing , ' said sgt. @entity29 with the @entity77 's office a man interview by the @entity32 disagreed			0
@entity79 , who is blind , was shopping at a gun store in @entity22 when he gave the paper his two cents			1
' when you shoot a gun , you take it out and point and shoot , and i do n't necessarily think eyesight is necessary , ' @entity79 said			0
it 's not clear how many people with visual impairments have permits to carry weapons in @entity22 because no one collects that information , but some advocates for the rights of the blind maintain that there should be no question — the blind should be allowed to carry firearms			1
following the law ? @entity104 sheriff @entity103 said that , if a blind person came to his office for a permit , he or she would be denied ‘ the fact that you ca n't drive a car does n't mean you ca n't go to a shooting range and see a target , ’ said @entity109 with @entity1			2
@entity115 said keeping legally blind people from obtaining weapon permits would violate the @entity118 with @entity119			0
some other states , including @entity121 , require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver 's license or doctor 's statement			2
@entity115 said she thinks someone could successfully challenge @entity121 's vision restriction because federal law requires states to analyze a situation individually before denying a service			0
even @entity137 , superintendent of the @entity138 , said guns may be a rare exception to his philosophy			0
‘ although people who are blind can participate fully in nearly all life 's experiences , there are some things , like the operation of a weapon , that may very well be an exception , ’ @entity137 said			0
some other states , including @entity121 , require anyone applying for a gun permit to provide proof of their visual ability by supplying a driver 's license or doctor 's statement			2
wild guess : county sheriffs can guess at how many permits they 've issued to the blind , but its a statistic no one keeps track of , so no one knows how many blind @entity19 currently carry firearms			1

no one knows how many blind @entity22 residents now legally carry guns because no one keeps track
the 2011 law that allows the practice gives blanket rights to hold a gun permit to all physically disabled @entity19
some county sheriffs are issuing such permits , while others refuse but some advocates say denied blind applicants could easily win appeals
