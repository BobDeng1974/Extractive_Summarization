@entity3 's top sedan : the 2014 @entity20 ( pictured ) was rated 95 points , out of a possible 100 by @entity12 only @entity23 's @entity22 ( 99 points ) and @entity26 's 135i coupe ( 97 ) scored higher than the @entity0 in this year 's report			1
the ranking by @entity12 is the latest symbol of @entity1 's effort to improve consumers ' perception of its brands - bringing some good news to the company 's hometown @entity37 , after the city filed for bankruptcy			0
the @entity40 historically was better known for its image as king of the rental cars			2
' it just shows that @entity1 is back and they 're making really desirable vehicles , ' @entity44 , director of auto testing at @entity12 , said in a telephone interview			0
' what 's really amazing about it is the vehicle in one year went from one of the worst vehicles in its category to the best			0
' the 2013 @entity40 scored 63 points in @entity12 testing			1
@entity44 said the new @entity40 's performance is part of a renaissance by @entity3 automakers that includes such redesigned vehicles as the @entity64 sedan , @entity65 and fusion sedan , and @entity67			1

the high rankings for its vehicles is welcome news for a company trying to put its 2009 bankruptcy and $ 49.5 billion @entity3 taxpayer - funded bailout behind it			0
@entity40 used to get 70 per cent of its sales from fleet customers , like car rental companies , and 30 per cent from consumers , but @entity1 officials want to flip that ratio			2

luxury vehicles : the mw 135i convertible proved tough competition for the impala and scored 97 points out of 100 , but was not in the sedan category @entity44 said many high - end cars suffer from over-complexity , while the new impala has many nice features but remains easy to use			1
