by @entity0 for @entity1 a rising number of women are complaining of ' mummy 's thumb ' , a form of tendonitis linked to lifting babies women being ' weaker than they used to be ' is to blame for a growing number of new mothers experiencing an injury known as ' mummy thumb '			1
older generations of women would regularly make their own bread , kneeding the dough , they would hand wash the clothes and perform other grueling daily chores			2
but in a world where bread makers and washing machines are a staple in the kitchen , women are suffering			2
chartered physiotherapist @entity26 told @entity1 a more sedentary lifestyle means women are ' generally weaker than they used to be '			1
that , she says , is the reason for an increasing number of women complaining of ' mummy thumb ' , known by its medical term @entity36 's tenosynovitis			1
it is a painful condition affecting the tendons in the thumb , that run down the side to the wrist			2
women suffering ' mummy 's thumb ' , commonly complain of pain every time they turn their wrist , go to grasp objects or make a fist			1
ms @entity51 said repeatedly lifting a baby can cause the condition to develop			1
she said : ' when you have a baby the ligaments in the body relax , and then all of a sudden , with weaker ligaments and floppy tendons you have to effectively weight lift all day			2
' statistically on average a new mother will lift their baby 25 to 30 times a day			0
' years ago we used to treat a lot of cases of washer women 's knee , when women would hand wash clothes regularly			1
' but as the times have changed , we no longer see that injury			0
instead we are seeing more cases of " mummy 's thumb " because historically women used to be stronger and so more prepared for the task of lifting a heavy baby all day			1
' while it is a common injury , ms @entity51 said as a physiotherapist she only sees the most severe of cases			1
' i am treating several mums with ' mummy thumb ' at the moment , ' she told @entity1			1
' but most mothers , busy with their babies , will put off going to seek treatment , instead researching the condition online			0
' being a new mum is a very special time so only those that are really suffering will find time to come and get treatment			0
' though referred to as ' mummy ' thumb ' , the condition is not a new one			1
physiotherapist @entity26 said one of the reasons behind the rise in the injury , treated using a splint , is the fact women are ' not as strong as they used to be '			1
a more sedentary lifestyle has resulted in women not building up the strength needed to ' effectively weight lift all day ' , after giving birth , ms @entity51 told @entity1 ' @entity113 's thumb ' known by its medical name , @entity36 's tenosynovitis is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist			1
people suffering de @entity36 's tenosynovitis , will probably feel pain every time they turn their wrist , grasp anything or make a fist			2
although the exact cause is not known , any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement - such as working in the garden , playing golf or racket sports or lifting your baby - can make it worse			2
symptoms of @entity36 's tenosynovitis include : pinching , grasping and other movements of the thumb and wrist aggravate the pain			1
chronic overuse of the wrist is commonly associated with the condition			0
people between the ages of 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing @entity36 's tenosynovitis			0
the condition is more common in women than in men , and it may be associated with pregnancy			0
baby care , which involves using your thumbs as leverage to lift your child hundreds of times a day , may also be associated with the @entity158 : @entity159 ms @entity51 said it has been around for years , and in recent years was known as ' texting thumb injury '			1
' as mobile phones started to get smaller , we started to see cases of what became known as ' texting thumb injury ' , ' she said			1
' it is the same condition , a form of tendonitis			2
different lifestyle factors mean we see it coming to the forefront			0
' ms @entity51 said new mothers can help reduce the risk of suffering ' mummy 's thumb ' by regularly using aids , including feeding pillows to bring the baby closer , without lifting			1
she added : ' for some mothers the condition will just burn out and ease off			0
' the condition is particularly prevalent when mothers are breast feeding			0
' when you breast feed the body releases a hormone called relaxin , which causes the collagen in the body to become more soft , leaving the joints more lax			0
' when mothers stop breast feeding , generally the condition will ease off in three to four months			0
' in more severe cases the condition needs hands - on manual therapy and in some cases hand splints			0
' she said women can take action before they fall pregnant , to build their strength and be mindful of the task ahead			0
researchers at the @entity159 , in the @entity209 say people aged between 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing @entity36 's tenosynovitis			0
