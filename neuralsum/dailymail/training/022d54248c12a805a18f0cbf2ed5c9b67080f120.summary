by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 15 january 2013 jumping out ahead of @entity2 , @entity1 has enacted the nation 's toughest gun restrictions and the first since the @entity7 school massacre , including an expanded assault - weapon ban and background checks for buying ammunition			1
@entity12 gov @entity11 signed the measure into law less than an hour after it won final passage in the @entity16 , with supporters hailing it as a model for the nation			1
but gun - rights activists are condemning it as a knee - jerk piece of legislation that wo n't make anyone safer and is too extreme to win support in the rest of the country			1
now it 's a law : @entity1 gov @entity11 signs @entity1 's @entity30 during a ceremony at the @entity32 @entity1 gov. @entity11 speaks during a news conference announcing an agreement with legislative leaders on @entity1 's @entity30 ' common sense can win , ' @entity11 said			1
' you can overpower the extremists with intelligence and with reason and with common sense			2
' owners of an estimated 1 million previously legal semiautomatic rifles , such as the bushmaster model used to kill 20 children and six adults in @entity48 , @entity7 , a month ago , will be allowed to keep their weapons but will have a year to register them with police			1
the sale of any more such weapons is prohibited			1
' when there 's a pileup of events , when the federal government does not do it , the state of @entity1 has to lead the way , ' said state assemblyman @entity60 , a @entity62 @entity61 and co-sponsor			0
in addition to outlawing a broader array of military - style weapons , the measure restricts ammunition magazines to seven rounds , down from the current 10 , creates a more comprehensive database of people barred from owning guns , and makes @entity1 the first state to require background checks to buy bullets			1
the system will also help flag customers who buy large amounts of ammo			2
in another provision , therapists , doctors and other mental health professionals will be required to tell state authorities if a patient threatens to use a gun illegally			2
the patient 's weapon could then be taken away			0
protests : a protester holds up a sign calling for a ban on assault weapons during a recent rally that demanded an end to gun violence in @entity97 @entity98 , president of the @entity99 of @entity100 , said @entity11 clearly understood gun violence is a complex issue requiring broader solutions than simply banning a particular weapon			1
' i think that 's an important message for the nation , ' he said			0
in a statement , the @entity107 said : ' these gun control schemes have failed in the past and will have no impact on public safety and crime			1
' ' while lawmakers could have taken a step toward strengthening mental health reporting and focusing on criminals , they opted for trampling the rights of law - abiding gun owners in @entity1 , and they did it under a veil of secrecy in the dark of night , ' the @entity107 said			1
president @entity125 will unveil his own proposals in response to the @entity48 tragedy on wednesday			0
he favors sweeping gun legislation , including a ban on assault weapons			1
but because of powerful opposition from the gun lobby , he is said to be weighing 19 steps he could take through executive action alone			2
those could include ordering stricter action against people who lie on gun - sale background checks , seeking to ensure more complete records in the federal database , and striking limits on federal research into gun use			1
deal : @entity11 shakes hands with @entity148 speaker @entity147 , as senator @entity149 , left , @entity150 , second from right , and senator @entity151 , right , look on @entity1 's law passed the @entity153 , which is run by a @entity155 - dominated coalition , 43 - 18 monday night			2
the @entity61 - controlled @entity148 approved it 104 - 43 tuesday afternoon			0
republicans complained the measure was rammed through the @entity16 and infringes on the @entity160 right to bear arms			2
' a lot of people say , ' why do you need these guns ? '' said assemblyman @entity166 , a @entity167 @entity155			0
' it 's part of the freedoms and liberties we have			0
... it 's for our public safety			0
it 's to protect us from our own government			0
' he said the bill was dangerous because it would give people a ' false sense of well - being			0
' ' you are using innocent children killed by a madman for your own political agenda , ' he said			0
' you are actually making people less safe			0
' the new law would make private sales of assault weapons to someone other than an immediate family be subject to a background check through a dealer @entity193 , president of the @entity194 , questioned whether other states or the federal government would follow @entity1 's lead and said he expects the law to be challenged in court			1
previously , @entity1 state law on assault weapons banned semiautomatics that have detachable magazines and at least two military - type features , such as a pistol grip , folding stock , muzzle flash suppressor or bayonet mount			1
the new law outlaws weapons with just one of those features			1
it also requires background checks for even private gun sales , except those among immediate family			1
in addition , it says handgun owners must renew their licenses every five years , and it increases prison sentences for using guns in various crimes or taking them onto school grounds			0
comfort : @entity11 consoles @entity226 , the mother of firefighter @entity227 who was shot and killed while responding to a blaze on @entity229 ' by making this a priority , the governor has not only saved lives but will hopefully inspire leaders in @entity2 also to take swift action , ' said @entity236 , president of the national @entity237			0
in a concession to the pro-gun side , local authorities will be allowed to withhold the identities of registered gun owners - an issue that erupted recently when a suburban @entity100 newspaper published the names and addresses of gun owners in its readership area			2
the @entity1 legislation sparked spirited discussion among customers at the @entity252 in the suburb of @entity254 , where business was so brisk that people had to wait in line in freezing temperatures just to get in the door			0
it 's absolutely - how to put it nicely - it 's prince @entity11 's bid for the @entity263 , ' said @entity264 , who was waiting to buy another handgun			0
' i want to do it before the right is taken away			0
@entity11 and @entity125 are two best gun salesmen in the history of the world			2

new law includes expanded assault weapons ban and background checks for buying ammo
supporters hail measure as a model for @entity97 on gun control
