' it stops me snacking and just gives me that oomph in the morning			0
i also love trampolining , it 's amazing for weight loss			0
i go to spin class and some days i dread it but always feel great after , ' she said			0

i ca n't wait to show off the results on my next holiday , ' she said			0
as for her diet , @entity1 says she never deprives herself and instead swaps her favourite treats for healthy alternatives			2
