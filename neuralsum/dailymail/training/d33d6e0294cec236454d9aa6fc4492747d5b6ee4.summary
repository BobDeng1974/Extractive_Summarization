using a dummy could protect babies from cot death , according to new @entity4 research			2
newborns who suck on dummies are less likely to die of @entity8 because they have better cardiac control , the research suggests			1
and scientists at the @entity11 in @entity12 found that the protective effects of the dummy remain even after it has fallen out of the sleeping baby ’s mouth			1
sucking on dummies reduces the risk of @entity8 because helps control a baby 's heartrate			1
associate professor @entity23 told @entity24 that previous studies have shown that using a dummy reduces the risk of cot death , however , she added that until now no one has been clear as to why this is the case			0
professor @entity23 explained that cot death is probably caused by the failure of the baby to wake itself up if its breathing stops , or if it experiences a dramatic fall in blood pressure			2
therefore , she believes that sucking a dummy must work either by increasing the baby ’s chance of waking up or by improving its cardiac control – its ability to regulate its heart rate			1
the professor then drew the conclusion that it must improve cardiac control as it would be counterintuitive to assume that a dummy increases arousal when it is given to a baby to help it get to sleep			1
babies who use a dummy have more variation in their heart rate , which is a sign that their cardiac system is responding to changes in their blood pressure to test her hypothesis , professor @entity23 and her team studied 37 healthy babies during daytime naps			1
they found that babies who were using a dummy had more variation in their heart rate , which is a sign that their cardiac system was responding to changes in their blood pressure			1
according to the @entity68 : you should not give a baby a dummy until breastfeeding is well established , at about one month old			2
dummies should be stopped when the baby is between six and 12 - months - old			1
you should place your baby on their back to sleep			2
do not smoke while you are pregnant or in the same room as your baby			2
do not share a bed with your baby			0
never sleep with your baby on a sofa or chair			0
never let them overheat - they should sleep in a room between 16 and 20 degrees @entity86 never allow their head become covered - their blanket should come no higher than their shoulders			0
for more information visit the @entity95 website this applied even at times when they were not actually sucking on the dummy			0
however , further research is required as professor @entity23 told @entity24 : ‘ i do n't think heart rate variability is the full story			0
’ professor @entity23 does not yet know why it is that sucking a dummy improves a baby ’s cardiac control			1
the @entity68 acknowledges that using a dummy at the start of sleep can reduce the risk of cot death			0
however , it says that there is not strong evidence to encourage the promotion of dummy use			0
it says that a baby should not be given a dummy until breastfeeding is well established , at about one month old , and that its use should be stopped when the baby is between six and 12 - months - old			0
@entity8 is the sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby			1
in the @entity123 at least 300 babies die from it each year with the most deaths occurring in babies under three - months - old			2
those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk , as are baby boys			0
most cot deaths occur at night and the exact cause is not known .			0

newborn babies that use dummies are less likely to die from @entity8
experts found that dummies improve a baby 's ability to regulate their heart beat even after finished sucking
