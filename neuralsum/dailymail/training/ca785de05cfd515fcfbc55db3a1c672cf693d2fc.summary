by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 17:24 est , 2 august 2013 as if health concerns were n't reason enough to perhaps avoid fast food , an @entity2 employee has provided another			0
in the latest instance of a fast food worker posting obscene behavior on - the - job to social media , a young @entity6 employee in @entity7 recently posted a picture of himself laying down on a pile of hamburger buns to @entity16			1
the fast food chain apologized and the employee was fired for his actions , according to a statement posted online			1
baka king : this former @entity6 @entity7 employee outraged people in the country with his on - the - job antics uploaded by @entity16 user @ inotayuta , who until recently slung @entity29 for the burger giant in @entity7 , the picture shows the young @entity7 sloucher relaxing with a huge grin on his face and the caption ‘ how many @entity36 do you think i 've made ? see if you can figure out it for yourself			1
’ as upsetting as the image of an employee lounging on buns is , several people were also upset by the filthy bucket next to the buns , in a posting of the picture to the @entity7 website 2ch			2
the same @entity16 user also posted a picture of himself sitting in a trash can while on the job			1
@entity52 rightly pointed out that the outrage among @entity7 stems from a culture where food and excellent customer service are considered very important			2
for an employee to deface the food in such a manner is reprehensible , if not unforgivable			0
hard at work : the now - deleted @entity16 account was a showcase for this employees less - than - stellar work ethic users on 2ch , the country ’s largest online forum , emailed the company en masse , demanding action be taken			1
in a statement , @entity6 @entity7 assured customers that the buns were trash and not served for consumption			2
it also said the employee was receiving a strict reprimand for the photos , which @entity80 reported was his termination			0
the offensive employee ’s @entity16 account has been deleted , but many on the site have taken to calling him ‘ @entity21 , ’ baka means ‘ stupid , ' but is also a play on the @entity7 spelling of @entity88 as ' ba - ga -			1
' the burger chain also said staff would be retrained on proper customer service and sanitation – hopefully that includes not sitting in the trash and adequate cleaning of buckets			0
at least he did n't lick the buns			0
not served to customers : @entity6 said the buns were disposed of and not served to customers , just as @entity103 asserted the taco shells licked by this employee were not served either			0

this is not the first photo the *ex-employee* posted to social media of on - the - job *goofing* off
@entity7 @entity16 users have taken to calling him ' @entity21 , ' a play on the chain *'s* name which *translates* to ' stupid '
