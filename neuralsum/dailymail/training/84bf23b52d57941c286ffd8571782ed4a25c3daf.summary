sound of music : actor @entity1 , can now hear ' the smallest noises ' after implant a revolutionary magnetic implant has restored the hearing of a young actor who went deaf in one ear at the age of 17 – and gives new hope to the thousands of @entity10 who can not benefit from traditional hearing aids			1
aspiring tv and theatre star @entity14 , 22 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , had the groundbreaking procedure at @entity18 , @entity16 , in march and says : ‘ i can now hear the smallest noises , like footsteps			1
‘ it sounds silly but these are things i ’ve not been able to hear for five or six years			0
i finally feel i ’m my normal self again			0
’ the new device is the bone anchored hearing aid ( @entity28 ) attract , and it replaces the older version of the @entity28			1
while the traditional implant uses a metal screw that is embedded in the patient ’s head and channels vibrations to the inner ear , the @entity30 involves a small magnetic disc being inserted beneath the skin behind the ear			1
this allows an electronic sound processor – the size of the bluetooth hands - free mobile phone earpiece – to be attached or removed as needed			1
when the receiver is not worn , the implant is completely invisible			2
@entity1 lost most of the hearing in his left ear after developing an infection of the inner ear bones called mastoiditis			1
he has full hearing in his right ear			1
after struggling with his hearing , he was referred to surgeon @entity55 at the hospital ’s @entity57 clinic earlier this year			1
@entity1 trialled the device using a headband to attach it behind the ear			2
then , a month after surgery to implant the magnetic disc , a sound receiver was fitted , giving him full hearing again			1
mr @entity55 explains : ‘ how we treat hearing loss depends on the physical cause of the problem			2
‘ @entity70 are suitable for patients who have problems with the outer and middle parts of the ear , usually due to infections or previous surgery			2
in these people , using a normal hearing aid in the ear canal wo n’t help because the transmitted sounds wo n’t reach the inner ear			1
‘ it ’s important to note these are not cochlear implants , which are for yet another group of patients – those with hearing loss due to problem in the inner ear			1
‘ @entity70 basically involve a titanium alloy peg being screwed into the skull behind the ear , so part of it pokes through the skin			1
in a similar way to a dental implant , the surrounding bone integrates with the screw , making it very secure and not removable			2
‘ the screw transmits sounds picked up by the receiver directly into the inner ear , bypassing the outer parts			2
but patients are left with a metal screw sticking out of the head behind the ear , which is visible when the receiver is removed – to swim , for instance			2
‘ this alone puts many off , but it also takes a lot of care and special cleaning on a daily basis to avoid infection			0
‘ the great thing about this new implant is there is no screw poking out			0
the receiver attaches to a small magnet under the skin so when it ’s removed , the head looks completely normal			0
’ the implant is attached during a 40 - minute procedure under general anaesthetic			1
the surgeon cuts a 2in semi-circular flap behind the ear and the implant is drilled about half an inch into the bone beneath			1
the magnet is attached to the screw and the flap is the stitched back into place			0
mr @entity55 adds : ‘ the skin heals in a fortnight , and the bone knits with the screw within a month			2
at this point it is stable , and we give the patient their receiver			0
’ approximately 1,500 patients with hearing loss who will potentially benefit from a bone - anchored hearing aid are diagnosed each year in the @entity10			1
up to half of these could benefit from the attract device			0
mr @entity55 hopes the attract will be adopted throughout the @entity154			0
he says : ‘ not every case is suitable due to the subtle differences in the causes of hearing loss , but it ’s worth discussing the option of the attract with your consultant should you be referred for a @entity28			0
’ @entity1 , who has had roles in doctors on @entity166 and @entity167 , had been offered an old - style @entity28 but turned it down as he felt a visible screw would affect his chances of success at auditions			0
he says : ‘ after the operation there was a bit of pain but i only needed a couple of paracetamol			0
‘ the moment they switched it on was a shock			0
being able to hear everything perfectly was distracting at first			0
but now when i take it off , it ’s as if someone has stuck cotton wool in my ear			0
having it on feels normal			0
