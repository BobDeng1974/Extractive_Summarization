by @entity1 reporter published : 23:43 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 24 september 2013 a video games sales clerk has penned a letter begging parents to think hard before buying young children a copy of the mega hit , and ultra-violent , @entity9 in a heartfelt letter posted to @entity13 , the game sales veteran says parents are often too preoccupied or indifferent to notice that they ’re buying sex and gore - filled games for elementary school children			1
‘ last week my store sold over a thousand copies of @entity9 , ’ he writes			1
‘ at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter			1
’ scroll down to see @entity9 trailer ... look carefully : a game store clerk says too many parents just buy extremely violent games like @entity9 without understanding their graphic content the fifth installment of the @entity9 franchise hit store shelves last week			1
in just one day , sales reached $ 800 million			1
game maker @entity34 says the launch is the biggest of any game in the company 's history			2
past versions of @entity9 have been derided by concerned parents and other groups as inappropriate for children and some would suggest that a game whose main objective is to cause as much property damage and bodily harm as possible is inappropriate for any age group			1
nonetheless , the @entity49 gives the game — as it has all @entity9 iterations — one of the strongest warnings possible : an m for mature audiences of 17 or older			1
a ' deeply disturbing world ' : the state - of - the - art game cost $ 270million to make and some fear its realism and ultra-violence will adversely affect children ' last week my store sold over a thousand copies of @entity9 , ' writes the sales clerk , ' at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter ' much like the ratings that deem who should , and should not view certain theatrical releases , a group called the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) rates all video game releases based on sexual content , violence , and other factors			1
they range from @entity81 for everyone — which includes games in the vein of @entity86 — to adults only , for the most explicit of @entity88 , like all its previous iterations , received an @entity54 for mature rating			1
this means the @entity49 recommends that only people aged 17 and over play the @entity95 with sales of @entity9 expected to exceed the $ 1 billion mark , it seems unlikely if not impossible that every parent is abiding by these guidelines			1
the concerned game seller is afraid an @entity49 rating is n’t enough			1
‘ over the years , i have watched the size , story , and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism			0
this is true for all kinds of games , including m - rated games , ’ he writes			0
but not every parent understand what the ratings are			0
‘ when i recite the phrases from the @entity49 ratings box on the back cover of an m - rated game and it just goes right over your head i feel the need to be more specific , ’ the writer continues			2
‘ so i mention things like a game having a first - person view of half - naked strippers or that the game has a mission that forces you to torture another human being			2
’ even such a forthright explanation is often not enough , he writes			0
‘ in response , i often hear things like , “ oh , it 's for my older son " or " all his friends already have it			0
” ’ sales of the game support this widespread indifference to its graphic content , and the writer admits his own love for such games			2
@entity148 : ' over the years , i have watched the size , story , and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism			0
this is true for all kinds of games , including m - rated games , ¿ he writes			0
the writer says he tries to convey to parents the graphic nature of games like @entity163			2
¿ in response , i often hear things like , ¿ oh , it 's for my older son " or " all his friends already have it			0
¿ ¿ ‘ then i wonder to myself how often the youngest child watches the “ older son ” playing and if “ all his friends ” were to jump off a cliff , ’ he writes			0
' now this is where those of you who are not parents will sound off with " you should let them judge " or " i killed hookers in @entity180 when i was five and i turned out fine			0
although , when your daughter comes home from elementary school crying because someone called her a b * * * h , you might change your tune			0
' the writer ends his plea with some simple advice : listen to the person selling you a game and just pay attention to what those games contain : ‘ i just ask that you look at the box , ask an associate for guidance , or just be more involved			2
lastly , when i try to describe the content and warnings of an m - rated game to you , please do n't ignore me and nod while scrolling through your @entity207			0
’ awfully popular : one day after its release , @entity9 had made a record $ 800 million in sales			1

' last week my store sold over a thousand copies of @entity9 , at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter , ' says the clerk
@entity9 launched september 17 and made $ 800 million in one day
the game has a mature audiences 17 and up rating but not all parents are paying attention
