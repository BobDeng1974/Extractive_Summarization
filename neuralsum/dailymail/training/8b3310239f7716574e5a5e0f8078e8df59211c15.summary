by @entity1 reporter created : 06:02 est , 29 may 2012 for years , it has been used as a metaphor for a never - ending job			1
now the @entity5 could soon be recognised for more prestigious reasons than simply the continual need to keep re-painting it			1

' extremely excited ' : @entity10 culture minister @entity60 said the @entity5 is a @entity10 icon that is recognised the world over ' this nomination should be regarded as a further tribute to the thousands of men who have contributed to building , maintaining and restoring the structure over the last 130 years			1
