@entity2 teenagers are falling behind those in high - performing @entity5 countries because too many parents in the @entity2 believe that ability is inherited rather than the result of hard work , an expert warned yesterday			1
sir @entity10 , chief education adviser to publishing giant @entity11 , suggested that higher expectations from ‘ tiger parents ’ in the @entity2 could boost school performance			1
‘ in the @entity22 cultures , there is a strong belief that effort will be rewarded , ’ said sir @entity10 , who advised @entity17 on education and policy delivery			1
sir @entity10 has warned @entity2 teenagers are falling behind in class and believes higher expectations from parents could boost performance in @entity2 schools ( picture posed by model ) ‘ if you try harder , work harder , you ’ll achieve higher standards , whereas in @entity2 and @entity35 , particularly , there is a perception that you are born either bright and the education system pulls that through , or does n’t			1
that has a big impact on attitudes			0
’ his remarks raise the prospect of a rise in ‘ tiger mothers ’ such as @entity45 , who described how she chivvied her two daughters to academic success @entity47 - style in a best - selling book which provoked fierce debate in @entity2			2
@entity51 , published in 2011 , was described by the @entity35 law professor , whose parents were ‘ very strict , @entity47 immigrant parents ’ as ‘ the story of my family ’s journey in two cultures ’			2
sir @entity10 made his remarks as the @entity2 came sixth in an international league table of education systems , behind @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
he said parental expectation in those @entity5 countries was ‘ very high ’ , with mothers and fathers spending ‘ long evenings ’ helping their children with homework			0
sir @entity10 , chief education adviser to publishing giant @entity11 , suggested that higher expectations from ' tiger parents ' in the @entity2 could boost school performance ‘ there is a contrast between those attitudes and here , where some parents do n’t exert that kind of pressure for achievement , do n’t expect effort to be rewarded and do think that either their child is really clever or is n’t – and sometimes reinforce that in a way that is unhelpful , ’ he added			1
‘ overall , there is a contrast that is deeply embedded in cultures			0
‘ the rise of @entity22 countries , which combine effective education systems with a culture that prizes effort above inherited “ smartness ” , is a phenomenon that other countries can no longer ignore			1
’ @entity2 ’s position in the latest @entity98 , published by @entity11 and compiled by the @entity99 , remains unchanged since the rankings were last produced , in 2012			2
@entity5 countries tightened their grip at the top of the table featuring 39 nations , while @entity106 slipped to fifth			2
a report accompanying the index found that ‘ parental expectations have a measurable impact on student motivation ’			0
sir @entity10 said the message needed to be ‘ spelled out ’ that there were risks associated with failing to gain a good education			1
he added : ‘ changing culture is an extremely difficult thing to attempt			0
‘ it is something that everybody involved in education needs to contribute to – it ’s not a job just for government			0
‘ the way schools relate to parents about their individual child is really important			0
that ’s an area where you can significantly change culture			0
‘ but in the end , it is about communicating with people about how different the 21st century is going to be from when they went to school			0
