by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 should be proud that @entity4 is isolated in @entity5 in the incr3asingly bitter row over @entity8 jobs , @entity2 claimed today			1
the health secretary backed the prime minister 's ‘ lonely ’ fight to block @entity12 from becoming @entity14 president amid brutal criticism			1
it follows claims from @entity19 ’s foreign minister @entity18 that mr @entity4 of ‘ f * * * * d up ’ attempts to veto the last @entity5 treaty			1
@entity23 leaders will meet at the @entity24 in @entity25 on thursday for a dinner to mark the start of the @entity28			1
but behind the scenes wrangling continues over mr @entity12 ’s candidacy , with almost every @entity23 country united in pushing the plan through despite opposition from @entity3			2
mr @entity4 is planning to push the issue to an unprecedented vote in @entity8 on friday to hammer home his argument that the former @entity39 prime minister is the wrong person to lead the @entity14			1
but mr @entity2 insists he is ' very proud ' that the @entity11 is taking the fight to @entity8			0
' sometimes leadership is lonely , ' mr @entity2 told @entity42			0
' but if it is the right thing to do for @entity3 i am glad that we have got a strong prime minister who is prepared to take those steps			2
' even if it means that he is isolated from time to time , i think people in @entity5 will respect the person who tells the truth that @entity5 needs to be reformed , that it ca n't carry on the way it is doing , it is unacceptable to put in place someone who does n't stand for reform and i am very proud that we have a prime minister who is prepared to do that , however difficult it is ... however isolated			1
' he is going out there , to these very difficult negotiations , fighting for the @entity3 national interest			0
' it is not comfortable			0
he is the first prime minister who has vetoed a @entity5 treaty and that was a huge shock to the system			1
' mr @entity4 yesterday held ‘ full and frank ’ talks with @entity72 , the current president of the @entity73			2
speaking in @entity74 , the @entity11 made clear he would fight ' until the end ' the nomination as his successor of the man seen by the @entity3 as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform			0
with a majority of @entity23 leaders - including @entity86 's @entity85 - throwing their weight behind mr @entity12 's candidacy , the prime minister looks certain to be out - voted under the qualified majority system , and is thought unlikely to secure enough support even to form a blocking minority of four or more member states			1
but the deep divisions caused by mr @entity4 ’s @entity23 strategy were exposed by extraordinary remarks made by @entity19 's foreign minister			1
mr @entity18 is reported to have accused mr @entity4 of ' incompetence in @entity5 affairs ' as part of a colourfully - worded private exchange with a former ministerial colleague			2
in a covert recording leaked to @entity19 magazine @entity103 , he is said to have accused the prime minister of falling foul of ' stupid propaganda ' and trying to appease his critics by feeding them scraps , only for the strategy to backfire			1
health secretary @entity2 backed the prime minister 's fight to block @entity12 ( right ) from becoming @entity14 president amid brutal criticism @entity19 foreign minister @entity18 was a member of the @entity115 at @entity116 with @entity117			1
@entity4 was also a member in the conversation , mr @entity18 is reported to have said : ' it 's either a very badly thought through move , or , not for the first time , a kind of incompetence in @entity5 affairs			1
' remember ? he f * * * * * up the fiscal pact			2
he f * * * * * it up			2
he is not interested , he does not get it , he believes in the stupid propaganda , he stupidly tries to play the system			0
' his whole strategy of feeding ( his critics ) scraps in order to satisfy them is just as i predicted , turning against him			0
' he should have said , f * * * off , tried to convince people and isolate ( the sceptics )			2
but he ceded the field to those that are now embarrassing him			0
' chancellor @entity140 has accused @entity5 leaders of saying one thing in private and another in public about the appointment			0
there has been speculation that mr @entity72 would prefer to delay a decision to avoid a row over the nomination overshadowing a visit by @entity23 leaders on thursday to @entity25 to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity28			1
@entity154 mp @entity153 dismissed the criticism			0
' when a system is being challenged and needs to be challenged , very often the vested interests in the system resort to abuse because they ca n't hear , they ca n't understand , what is going wrong , ' he told @entity42			0
‘ if [ mr @entity4 ] succeeded in reversing this decision it would be a huge triumph for @entity3 diplomacy but i suspect this is now a foregone conclusion , everyone has dug in			0
' but there are two messages in this : one is that @entity12 is the tip of a very large federalist iceberg			0
' there is a very , very strong and consensual agenda amongst the establishment and the majority of the member states to go down the root of a federal state			0
