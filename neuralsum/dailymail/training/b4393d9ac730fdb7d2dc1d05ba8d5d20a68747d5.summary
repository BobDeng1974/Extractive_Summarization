by @entity1 reporter published : 19:21 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 26 august 2013 a 9 - year - old survivor of last year 's tragic shooting at @entity4 in @entity5 has found comfort in a place many people would n't expect : a stocky , 73 - pound pit bull named @entity10			1
while many would see @entity10 and run for the hills , @entity4 fourth - grader @entity11 considers him one of her closest friends - she even plans to bring a miniature , stuffed version of the dog with her on her upcoming first day of school			1
despite his hulking size - and unwarranted bad reputation - @entity10 is a registered therapy dog whose job it is to put a smile on the face of a human who may be having a tough time , or suffering from a serious injury or disease			1
therapy : @entity11 ' never stops smiling ' when she 's with her friend @entity10 , a 73 - pound pit bull buds : @entity4 9 - year - old @entity11 and therapy pit bull @entity10 have developed a strong bond lucky dog : @entity10 was a stray scheduled to be euthanized when he was adopted by @entity37 in 2010 and @entity10 is very good at his job			1
' it all starts with a belly rub , ' @entity10 's owner , @entity37 , told @entity42 's today			2
' he meets you , he flops on his back			0
' @entity10 's healing powers almost were never realized - two years ago , he was one of hundreds of pit bulls in the @entity49 shelter system that was likely to be euthanized			1
then a pit bull rescue group called @entity51 took an interest and attempted to find him a home by placing him on its advocacy website			0
ms. @entity37 , a hospice worker in @entity56 , @entity5 , found @entity10 on the website and offered to adopt him just hours before he was scheduled to be euthanized			1
ms. @entity37 was never worried about @entity10 being a pit bull - a breed of dog that has a stereotype of being aggressive and dangerous , a stigma ms. @entity37 hopes to change			2
' both ends of the leash are responsible for the future of these dogs , ' said @entity67 , who also brings @entity10 to assisted living facilities , hospitals and school libraries to connect with elderly people , the sick , and struggling young readers			2
flying colors : @entity67 had @entity10 tested to see if he could be a therapy dog			1
he passed with ' flying colors ' popular pooch : @entity10 has more than 700 @entity78 followers and a full schedule of therapy sessions at 73 pounds , @entity10 will curl into a ball and roll onto his back on command			1
he 'll then paw the air with his signature painted toe nails , inviting people in for a belly rub			1
after adopting @entity10 , ms. @entity37 enrolled him in obedience training and ultimately took him to the @entity90 to have him tested to become certified for therapy			1
' he passed with flying colors , ' she recalled			1
' the examiner , he said if you do n't make this dog a therapy dog it would be a shame			1
' now , @entity10 is known as the ' @entity99 , ' and has more than 700 @entity78 fans , as well as a full schedule of therapy visits in the tri-state area			2
but @entity11 remains one of his favorite clients			0
' " @entity11 " is a special word in our house , ” @entity67 said			0
@entity11 and @entity10 first met in december - just weeks after the senseless shooting spree that left 28 people dead , including 20 first - grade students - at a @entity113 party for her classmates			2
@entity11 was thankfully tardy the day of the shooting and missed horrific event thanks to a doctor appointment that morning			0
but she lost several friends and teachers			0
bad rep : pit bulls like @entity10 have a bad reputation as being aggressive and dangerous - a stigma @entity67 hopes to change stylish : @entity10 's signature painted toe nails are a hit amongst his many fans ' it was still a really vulnerable time for her , and she just was comfortable sitting next to @entity10 , ' @entity11 's mother , @entity128 , told today			1
' he 's strong and i think she just feels safe			0
' the day after their initial meeting , @entity11 asked her mother if she could see the friendly pooch again , so ms. @entity11 got in touch with ms. @entity37 to arrange another play date for the two - the first of many			0
' i think for her , there 's a security in that it 's a dog and not another person , ' ms. @entity11 said			0
' @entity11 becomes free and runs and plays and smiles			0
it 's a very tender thing between the two of them			0
' @entity10 even attended @entity11 's 9th birthday party in april			2
he was wearing a hat in the shape of a birthday cake and let @entity11 and her friends climb all over him			0
after getting to know her new friend , @entity11 wants to be a veterinarian , and has helped her family train a @entity155 they adopted			0
' i think that she loves that @entity10 is a therapy dog — that he has a job and that there 's something special about him , ' ms. @entity11 said			1
@entity11 starts fourth grade on tuesday , and while the wounds of the @entity4 shooting are still there , @entity163 has helped them heal for @entity11			0
' @entity11 has a smile that could light the world , and i feel like we used to see that smile a lot more , but it 's definitely still there , ' ms. @entity11 said			0
