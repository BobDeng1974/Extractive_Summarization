the very first black @entity1 villain , @entity0 , has said the legendary secret agent role should only ever be portrayed by a white actor and ' political correctness be damned '			1
@entity0 , who starred as dr @entity5 in the 1973 @entity1 installment @entity7 , said the role was created by @entity9 for a white actor and should be portrayed on the big screen as such			1
his comments come in response to months of speculation that black @entity16 actor @entity15 is in the running to be named as @entity19 's successor			1
' he said : ' he was established as a white character , played by white actors			0
i do n't think it 's right for black actors or writers to do roles that whites have made historically white roles			0
' @entity0 argued that a black man could play 003 or 006 , but could not be 007 , and suggested new characters should be written for black heroes			1
last month veteran @entity1 actor @entity21 was widely condemned for his claim that @entity15 , 42 , could not be the next @entity1 because he was not ' @entity41 @entity41 ' enough			1
following the publication of the interview , sir @entity21 faced strong criticism on @entity45 over the statement			0
he made the ' @entity41 - @entity41 ' comments , even though former @entity49 @entity48 , @entity50 and @entity51 were @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0

@entity63 - born @entity15 ( pictured ) has been tipped to replace @entity19 as the next @entity1 actor current @entity1 @entity19 ( pictured ) has said @entity15 is the only possible choice to replace him he was born in @entity63 , raised in @entity66 , schooled in @entity67 , started work in @entity69 and he supports @entity70			1
however , with speculation rampant he is being lined up to replace @entity73 , @entity15 himself has said he has ruled out taking the role			2
today @entity75 reported him as saying : ' it 's a rumour that 's really started to eat itself			0
if there was a chance of me getting @entity1 , it 's gone			0
' he also responded to claims he was not ' @entity41 ' enough for the role , stating he was ' born and raised ' in @entity41			0
following @entity7 , @entity0 went on to take central roles in several successful @entity85 films , including @entity86 and @entity87			2
