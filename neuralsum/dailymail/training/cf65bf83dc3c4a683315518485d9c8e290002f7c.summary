as @entity1 threatens to attack the @entity2 , the @entity0 may be about to pull their ambassador out of @entity4			1
a sign outside the pariah state 's embassy - an ordinary home in west @entity4 - says they will be ' loading ' on tuesday morning			1
despite @entity0 warning that the safety of foreigners in their country ' can not be guaranteed ' beyond next wednesday , the @entity9 are refusing to pull their man out of @entity14			1
getting out ? a sign outside the @entity0 embassy suggests the ambassador could be quitting @entity4 - as there will be ' loading ' on tuesday morning quitting @entity4 ? the seven - bedroom ordinary home that is the @entity0 embassy where ambassador @entity21 lives although @entity23 are staying put , a sign pinned to a tree outside the oppressive regime 's base in @entity28 suggests ambassador @entity21 may be about to retreat			1
it said : ' advance notice			0
please do not park here during the following period when loading work will take place			0
' tonight a man who answered the phone at the embassy in @entity39 claimed they had no plans to quit @entity23			1
when asked why the sign was there , he responded : ' one guy , a secretary is leaving the country at the end of his term			2
he asked for a van to carry all of his belongings			2
' there is a new secretary coming soon			1
' he refused to give the name of the old secretary or say who the replacement will be			2
honour : @entity21 , the @entity0 ambassador , presents his credentials to the @entity61 in a private audience at @entity63 last year pressed on whether they were leaving , the official said ' no ' and added ' the embassy is open every day			1
there is no one here now			0
' when the @entity71 asked the man on the phone to identify himself he hung up			0
while other ambassadors get to live in some of @entity23 's most expensive properties near @entity76 , @entity0 mr @entity21 has to put up with a modest 1920s home			1
the seven - bedroom property , down the road from where @entity82 star @entity81 lived , has been home to the pariah state since 2003			2
demonstrators regularly gather outside the ordinary property which stands out only because of the 40ft flagpole in the garden			2
it was business as usual at the property on friday when mr @entity21 's wife was seen going out shopping			0
contrast : while the @entity0 ambassador is forced to make do with a semi-detached home - this is the @entity98 embassy near @entity76 although they keep the blinds drawn down , neighbours said they were nice people			1
one said : ‘ we had some of the diplomats round for a drink once , ’ he said			0
‘ they told us they love @entity107			0
‘ but i suppose that ’s no surprise coming from @entity0 , is it ? one of them said he was a big fan of @entity113			1
’ amid mounting tensions , foreign secretary @entity114 today insisted @entity23 ' should be concerned ' about @entity0 's activities			1
he said the ' danger of miscalculation ' by @entity1 's regime , which had worked itself up into a ' frenetic state of rhetoric ' , must be considered			0
@entity14 comes to @entity4 : website for the @entity0 embassy in @entity4 - which is an ordinary semi-detached home in @entity28 threats : dictator @entity1 , pictured here pointing a pistol , has repeatedly threatened to attack @entity128 and the @entity2 but he insisted it was vital the international community remained calm and stressed there were no signs that @entity0 was beginning to re-position its forces ready for war			1
speaking on @entity135 's @entity136 , mr @entity114 said : ' there 's a threat to the world from any country breaching the non-proliferation treaty , which @entity0 is doing , acting in contravention of a whole series of @entity145 resolutions and setting out to develop more and more longer range weapons , testing new nuclear weapons and indulging in the proliferation of many items to other countries as well			2
' we should be concerned about that			0
there is a danger in that			0
' but it is important to stress that we have n't seen in recent days , in recent weeks , a change in what is happening in @entity0 society			2
we have not been able to observe that			0
we 've have n't seen the repositioning of forces or the redeployment of ground forces that one might see in a period prior to a military assault or to an all out conflict			0
' mr @entity114 declined to speculate on whether the 29 - year - old dictator was ' nuts ' .			0

@entity0 embassy deny they are quitting @entity23 and claim a *removals* van is coming for a secretary on tuesday
property is an ordinary home on @entity39 in @entity28 , west @entity4
@entity0 ambassador ' is a big fan of @entity113 '
modest 1920s home is a far cry from *extravagant* embassies near @entity76 , west @entity4
