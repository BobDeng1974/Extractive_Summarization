@entity14 ( left ) has a new cologne named after him that smells ' woodsy and citric , ' while the late @entity25 president @entity24 ( right ) has a scent that features notes of mango and papaya ' they will be very attractive colognes , but the names also mean a lot to us , ' said @entity36 , vice president for research and development for @entity39 , which produces homeopathic medicines , cleaning products and dietary supplements			1
