by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 16:58 est , 9 november 2013 energy giants are to repay customers up to £ 2 billion which they have stockpiled from direct debit overpayments			1
in a move hailed as a victory for @entity10 , beleaguered bosses of the ‘ @entity7 ’ power companies agreed to the climbdown after a crunch summit with ministers			1
the deal means any customer who is in credit by more than one month ’s payment will be given an automatic refund , and comes two weeks after this newspaper exposed how the companies were making up to £ 36 million a year in interest from accounts in credit , leading to accusations of profiteering			1
energy minister @entity26 said last night : ‘ this looks like a real win for hard - pressed working people			1
delighted : energy minister @entity26 praised the announcement as ' a real win for hard - pressed working people ' ' thanks to the pressure from @entity10 and consumers up and down the country , we have together been able to get a better deal without having to resort to the blunt instrument of legislation , which means these changes should be in place by this winter			1
’ energy firms have also pledged to review customers ’ accounts twice a year to stop people amassing huge credit			1
more than 13 million households pay a fixed amount every month by direct debit , with many overpaying in the summer when usage is lower			0
it has led to huge credits on consumer accounts , earning interest for the energy companies			1
the new initiatives , which are still to be agreed , will be a welcome relief to millions of households facing inflation - busting price hikes in fuel bills			0
problem : when customers switch provider some suppliers did not always issue a refund to those still in credit accepted : directors at the @entity7 have agreed to make repayments after the @entity10 's exposé two weeks ago			1
( pictured clockwise from top left ) @entity73 , external affairs director at npower ; @entity75 , ceo of @entity76 ; @entity77 , @entity78 managing director ; @entity79 , managing director of @entity80 a well - placed industry source said the @entity7 had conceded they needed to act and had agreed ‘ in principle ’ to creating a best practice across the industry to tackle the issue			1
the source said that under the plans , twice yearly checks of customers ’ accounts would reveal those who are paying too much			1
the suppliers would then offer customers the choice of having their money back or leaving the money in the account			1
the source said : ‘ companies are looking at how to implement this			2
it may not be triggered by an amount , but by how much a customer spends each month			0
if an account has more than one month ’s money in credit , then it will be flagged up			1
pressure : the firms have made their compromise two weeks after @entity10 published an exposé mr @entity26 added : ‘ i had a very frank and candid meeting with the @entity7 last week ; it was cards on the table time			1
‘ i ’m very pleased to report that we appear to have made real progress for consumers			2
there ’s still detail to be agreed and i will not rest until we have scored a better deal for all energy consumers			2
’ @entity119 , an energy expert at price comparison website @entity122 , said suppliers need to reassure customers they wo n’t be sitting on their money			1
she said : ‘ establishing a blueprint for best practice – whereby all suppliers will review their customers ’ accounts at least twice a year with a view to refunding any overpayments – seems like a sensible solution			1
it means that consumers will know exactly where they stand			0
’ @entity137 , executive director of consumer group which ? added : ‘ with trust in the energy market at an all - time low , companies must quickly deliver on this commitment to promptly refund consumers who are in credit with their direct debit accounts			1
‘ as which ? told the minister and the @entity7 suppliers , some energy companies already automatically refund even very low credit balances , so there ’s no reason why the entire industry ca n’t follow suit			1
all companies need to play fair and charge more accurately			2
’ trust : @entity137 , chief executive of which ? , has warned companies to deliver on their promise quickly research by which ? in 2012 said the energy giants enjoy a £ 1.2 billion surplus each year from customers who are in credit – which they are then free to invest for an annual return of up to three per cent			1
but industry experts said the number was closer to £ 2 billion			2
four of the @entity7 have announced price rises on dual - fuel bills			2
@entity171 is raising its bills by 10.4 per cent from next month			0
@entity78 customers will pay 8.2 per cent more from this friday and @entity176 gas prices go up by 9.2 per cent on november 23			2
@entity178 customers will pay an extra 8.6 per cent from december 6			2
@entity80 has said it will not raise prices before january			0
@entity76 has refused to rule out an imminent price rise			0
a spokesman for @entity182 , the industry trade association , said : ‘ @entity10 has raised a very important issue			0
we are looking at this closely with our members			0
’ families will be able to see how much they are paying in green taxes on their fuel bills , under new plans being considered by ministers			0
a senior @entity193 source said @entity195 peers were looking at amending the @entity196 so power firms will be forced to include details of how much environmental initiatives are costing each consumer on every bill			0
the source said : ‘ this will make green levies more transparent for customers who will be able to see how much of their bill is made up of green levies and taxes			0
already pressed : recently announced price hikes will add £ 50 to every family 's bill - even £ 100 in some @entity211 in the @entity212 are pushing for an amendment to the @entity214 , which is in its final stages			0
' conservative ministers are sympathetic but it is yet to be agreed by the @entity218			0
’ @entity119 , an energy expert at comparison website @entity122 , said : ‘ telling consumers how much the additional green levies add up to would provide far greater transparency and could mean that they are better able to judge the fairness of future price increases for themselves			0
’ @entity137 , executive director of consumer group which ? said : ‘ we have called for a clear and consumer - friendly graphic on annual energy statements to show all the costs that make up our energy bills			0
‘ while this would be helpful , it wo n’t help the millions of hard - pressed households that are worried about getting into debt or cutting back on their heating this winter			0
‘ consumers need to see that the government is delivering more radical changes			0
the government must show how it is getting under control all the energy policy costs that are being added to people ’s bills			2
