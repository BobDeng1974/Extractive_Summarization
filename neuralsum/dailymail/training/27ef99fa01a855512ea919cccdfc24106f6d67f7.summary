a few days ago , the first reviews began to trickle in for the comedy @entity1 , which depicts a shambolic attempt to assassinate the @entity4 dictator @entity3			1
unfortunately , they were less than enthusiastic			2
one critic called it a ‘ non-stop sledgehammer … bereft of satiric zing ’ , while the @entity9 industry paper variety called it an ‘ alleged satire that ’s about as funny as a communist food shortage ’			2
even the film ’s makers probably imagined that having earned back its budget from its target audience of @entity21 teenagers , their picture would soon disappear into well - deserved obscurity			1
climb - down : @entity23 as @entity4 tyrant @entity3 in @entity1 , which has been pulled from release after @entity25 was hacked and confidential material leaked across the internet terrorists : @entity3 and his wife @entity30 remembered the three year anniversary of the death of @entity33			1
if @entity4 was to launch a cyber attack it could bring the @entity36 to its knees in 15 minutes how wrong they were			1
for it now seems certain that @entity1 will go down in history not as an indictment of @entity9 ’s obsession with the lowest common denominator , but as a chilling symbol of the future of international conflict			2
when , two days ago , the film ’s parent company @entity48 announced it was cancelling its @entity51 release , the decision was widely seen as an abject surrender to foreign pressure			2
all week , @entity4 hackers have been leaking secrets found in @entity48 ’s emails , from insider gossip about the star @entity58 to the script of the next @entity61 film			1
in an attempt to shore up wavering cinema chains who were uncertain as to whether to screen the film , @entity62 recommended that ‘ people go to the movies ’			2
but as pressure mounted , it became clear @entity48 ’s @entity21 bosses lacked the courage to stand up to @entity3 ’s cyber bullies			1
and when the hackers issued a terrifying warning to @entity21 audiences , telling them to ‘ remember september 11 , 2001 ’ , @entity48 simply lost its nerve			2
thus , @entity1 has vanished from the schedules , and it seems unlikely it will ever return			2
in the meantime , @entity9 figures have been queuing up to denounce @entity48 ’s decision as an awful setback for free speech			2
‘ today , the @entity21 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished bedrock principle , ’ said the director @entity83			1
the actor @entity87 went further : if @entity48 had been in charge of the @entity90 war effort in @entity91 , he said , then the @entity92 would have won			2
in many ways the story could hardly be a better metaphor for @entity21 foreign policy in the past few years			2
after almost a decade of reckless , ham - fisted over-stretch under @entity98 — typified by this month ’s appalling revelations about the @entity101 ’s torture programme — the @entity21 has turned inwards			1
@entity62 ’s policy in @entity106 and @entity107 has been a shambles , his attitude to @entity104 is dithering and pusillanimous , and he seems entirely bereft of ideas about how to fight back against the jihadists of @entity111			1
lending support : @entity87 said that if @entity48 had been in charge of the @entity90 war effort in the @entity91 then the @entity92 would have won in this context , therefore , @entity48 ’s surrender to the @entity4 merely looks like more of the same			1
but i think there is another dimension to this story — one that should frighten every man , woman and child in the western world			2
for years , military experts have been warning that our expectations of warfare are dangerously outmoded			0
we still think of war as something that happens on a foreign battlefield , fought out between professional armies with tanks and guns			0
but for more than a century , the front line has been moving closer and closer to the ordinary @entity137 household			0
from the horrors of the @entity141 to the pub bombings of the @entity143 , our illusions of living in an island fortress have been brutally dispelled			0
cyber warfare is merely the latest frightening development in the history of human conflict — a threat to @entity137 society that could have potentially devastating consequences for millions of families			1
we can not say , though , that we were not warned			0
as long ago as the spring of 2010 , the former @entity153 counter-terrorism chief @entity152 , who worked for the @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity98 administrations , published a book warning that the @entity158 might have lost the new cyber war before it had even officially started			1
as mr @entity152 pointed out , the @entity104 , the @entity160 and the @entity4 had already recruited legions of hackers , while @entity163 even boasts of having the world ’s largest cyber army			1
in his book @entity166 , he paints a petrifying scenario			0
if the @entity104 or @entity4 launch an all - out cyber attack , he suggests , then they could effectively bring @entity171 society to its knees within just 15 minutes because we are so utterly dependent on electronics , which run everything from nuclear power stations to our bedside alarm clocks			1
with bugs and viruses racing through computer systems , the military and the police might be paralysed			0
trains could crash , pipelines explode , the financial markets risk going into meltdown , the @entity182 might crash , hospitals could fall dark , cash dispensers might go dead and ordinary life might come grinding to a halt			0
last year , the @entity193 ’s @entity192 - based cyber unit was caught hacking into major @entity21 corporations such as the nuclear power company @entity196 and the @entity197			1
workers remove a poster - banner for @entity1 from a billboard in @entity9 , @entity201 , on thursday after @entity48 announced it was cancelling the movie 's @entity51 release due to a terrorist threat in @entity137 , the head of @entity206 and the director - general of @entity208 sent a letter to the bosses of all the @entity212 350 companies stating that cyber attacks against @entity137 companies are causing significant damage to their reputations and revenues			1
‘ it scares me to death , ’ one military insider told the economist			0
‘ the destructive potential is so great			0
’ it sounds like the stuff of science fiction			0
but all military technology sounded futuristic once , from tanks and atom bombs to drones and satellites			0
and some countries are already all too aware of the costs of losing a cyber war			1
in the spring of 2007 , @entity104 hackers paralysed government computers in the little republic of @entity237 , a member of @entity239 and the @entity240			1
it was a classic example of imperialist bullying , carried out not with tanks and gunboats , but with computer worms and viruses			0
seven years on , @entity137 and @entity21 military planners are still studying the @entity237 attacks for clues to the future of cyber warfare			1
even if you rarely use a computer , the dangers of a @entity104 or @entity4 cyber attack can hardly be exaggerated			1
a future in which hospitals risk being paralysed , the railways grinding to a halt , supermarkets running out of food and police computer systems collapsing is not one to be taken lightly			0
of course , the leaking of @entity9 secrets and @entity61 scripts is not in the same league			0
but if the @entity4 can beat a giant corporation such as @entity48 , then who is to say they can not take down @entity137 ’s public services , too ? as the furore over @entity1 has shown , the @entity36 is clearly on the back foot			1
the former @entity273 , @entity274 , remarked this week : ‘ no one should kid themselves			0
with the @entity48 collapse , @entity21 has lost its first cyber war			1
this is a very , very dangerous precedent			0
’ i think he is right			0
i believe the struggle over the interview is just the start			0
and i suspect the shock troops in any future world war will not be blood - streaked men in battle fatigues , but pale - faced computer geeks , hunched intently over their keyboards			2
in the years after the fall of the @entity293 , we in the @entity36 were too busy congratulating ourselves on our victory to grasp that a new and potentially even deadlier challenge lay ahead			0
too complacent , too confident in our mastery of the old technology , we failed to realise that war itself was changing			0
from @entity299 to @entity300 , the @entity36 faces implacable adversaries , equipped with the new digital weapons of the 21st century			0
if you want to see the battlefield of the future , just look around your living room .			0

if the @entity104 or @entity4 launch an all - out cyber attack they could effectively bring @entity171 society to its knees within just 15 minutes
