its success is a blow to @entity28 leader @entity27 who last week claimed the @entity1 was going backwards thanks to private sector involvement			1
@entity31 , the founder of @entity32 the @entity1 who helped expose the @entity34 neglect scandal , said : ‘ what this shows is the potential of allowing those on the frontline to lead , as @entity23 do			2

this dropped to £ 1million last year and the trust , whose chief executive @entity116 is a former @entity119 supply chain director , expects to break even this year before moving into the black in 2015			1

i do n’t know where that leaves @entity27			0

mr @entity116 said : ‘ two years ago , @entity4 suffered from a series of problems so severe it faced imminent closure			1
now , thanks to the incredible efforts of our leading doctors and nurses , we are the top - ranking hospital for quality of care in the whole of @entity193			1
‘ it is clear proof the growing number of hospitals in special measures across the @entity1 can be transformed too , staying open to deliver the critical services their patients need			0
’ a @entity202 spokesman said : ‘ patients should get the best possible care , regardless of who provides it			2
’ looked after : @entity207 at the hospital living only a short distance from @entity210 , @entity207 had heard plenty of ‘ horror stories ’ from other patients			2

yesterday i was bored out of my skull so i started drafting a couple of letters about people who deserve to be commended			0
’ the hospital also received glowing reviews from @entity252			2
she had ‘ hated ’ her first stay at the hospital in 1999 and when she was put on to a mixed - sex ward with seven other patients			2
but the 65 - year - old was overwhelmed by the remarkable turnaround at the hospital when she was readmitted earlier this year			1
mrs @entity252 said the exceptional level of care was so good that many older patients ‘ did not want to leave ’			2
after being admitted in february following a severe asthma attack , the mother - of - one said she ‘ could n’t believe ’ the number of nurses and doctors constantly on hand to provide assistance			0
‘ they were n’t there just to care			2
they were investigating all the possibilities of what was wrong with me , ’ she said			0
