@entity1 head coach @entity0 is targeting an historic @entity3 win in @entity4 and wants a marker to be set in tuesday 's tour opener against the @entity7			1
wales have never beaten the @entity9 on @entity11 soil and few are giving them a chance during this two - @entity15 series given the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 are missing through injury			1
@entity0 's men were beaten 2 - 0 when they last toured @entity4 in 2008 but , with the @entity26 15 months away , the @entity24 knows how important it will be for @entity1 to improve their poor record against the southern hemisphere 's big three of @entity4 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
good start : @entity0 is hoping @entity1 can put down a marker against the @entity7 ' the target is to win , ' he said			1
' i had only just been in charge when we were here in 2008			0
we were well beaten in the first test and came back and were unlucky in the second test			0
' we were in front and had a couple of rough calls go against us in the second test			0
' we need to start well and get some confidence and hopefully we can win			2
' a couple of years ago in @entity29 we were very unlucky , we were close to @entity4 in the autumn and we are not here to make up the numbers			1
' we are here to build , get some confidence and hopefully to win the series			2
' out : wales have a number of players out through injury including @entity18 ( right ) before the test series gets under way , @entity1 will face the @entity7 , who play in the domestic @entity58 tournament , in @entity59 on tuesday			1
@entity0 has handed @entity61 flanker @entity60 the captaincy as the tough - tackling @entity63 back - rower looks to prove his fitness after five weeks out with a hamstring injury			1
three of the four uncapped players in the touring party - @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity70 - are handed the chance to impress , with the experience of fly - half @entity75 , wing @entity77 and lock @entity79 also called upon			2
@entity0 is the first to admit he knows very little about the @entity7 , who are to enter @entity81 in 2016 and are coached by former @entity82 , but is demanding a good performance against a typically robust @entity11 side			1
' i do n't know a lot about them , ' he said			0
selected : @entity75 's ( right ) experience will be key against the @entity7 ' this is a cross as to whether they are in @entity58 mode or getting ready for @entity81			1
but we are looking forward to it , getting to @entity94			0
' it 's a lovely place and a good stadium and it will be a massive challenge			2
' just because we do n't know a lot about them does not mean they will not be typical @entity11 side , they will be tough and physical			0
' but we need to start this tour on the front foot and we will be looking for a good performance ahead of that first test			2
' it is the first time @entity60 has been asked to lead @entity1 , although he did skipper the @entity61 against @entity107 last summer			1
@entity108 ( @entity109 ) , a @entity77 ( @entity110 ) , @entity111 ( @entity110 ) , @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , @entity114 ( @entity113 ) , @entity115 ( @entity116 ) , @entity117 ( @entity113 ) , @entity118 ( @entity119 ) , @entity120 ( @entity109 ) , @entity121 ( @entity113 ) , @entity122 ( @entity113 ) , i @entity79 ( @entity109 ) , @entity124 ( captain , @entity63 ) , @entity126 ( @entity113 ) , @entity127 ( @entity109 )			0
replacements : @entity132 ( @entity110 ) , a @entity133 ( @entity109 ) , @entity134 ( @entity113 ) , @entity135 ( @entity116 ) , a @entity70 ( @entity113 ) , @entity136 ( @entity113 ) , @entity130 ( @entity129 ) , @entity131 ( @entity113 )			0
@entity0 has no doubt he is up to the task			1
he said : ' he did a good job captaining the @entity61 and i am sure he will do so again			0
he needs some rugby and has been unfortunate			0
' he was playing some good rugby towards the end of the @entity144 and was getting some more rugby with @entity63 , but he pulled his hamstring			0
' but he is a guy who gets better with rugby under his belt			0

@entity0 hoping for an historic @entity3 win in @entity4
@entity1 coach preparing his team for tour opener against the @entity7
