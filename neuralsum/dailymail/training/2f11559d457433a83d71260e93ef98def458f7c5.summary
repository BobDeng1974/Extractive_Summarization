by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 29 march 2013 a shark caught on a fishing line before being horrifically clubbed over the head and killed has been captured on video revealing the brutal reality of what is happening to global shark populations			1
as the shark is reeled out of the water its catcher picks up a large bat and repeatedly strikes it with blows across the head until it can be pulled on board and tossed onto a pile of other dead sharks			1
the shocking footage is mixed with clips from around the world showing health and beauty and food products made using parts of sharks being sold in markets and stores			1
he said : ‘ @entity34 are in trouble - global populations are getting devastated commercially			2
‘ the whole shark conservation focus has been on the shark finning industry which is horrible enough but the reality is there is a huge demand for shark products all over the world			2
‘ i made this video to share the jaws and teeth being sold in tourist shops , their oil and cartilage used for pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies , meat sold in the local markets and as fertilizers and dog food , their skins sold for fashion - the list goes on			1
‘ we had all this footage from travels to places like the @entity73 coast in @entity74 and @entity75 of our run ins with fishermen and after watching it all a story started forming in my head			2
footage of fishermen working on the @entity73 coast and in @entity74 shows the brutal treatment of sharks the future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are being harvested fails to slow according to @entity29 ‘ this story had to be told - photos just do n't really impact the way video does			1
i had to share what was really happening to our shark populations			1
if the world does n't know it 's happening then there is nothing to get up in arms about			0
‘ i hope people are shocked that this is happening and feel empathy i really do			0
it 's hard to care for sharks because they have such a bad reputation			2
‘ but the reality is sharks are not the monsters people believe them to be they are beautiful and amazing creatures who are highly misunderstood			2
‘ most people do n't know we have over 400 species of sharks in our oceans , they believe a shark is a shark , and ca n't really tell one species from the other			1
@entity29 said he finds the footage extremely painful because sharks are not just animals , but friends to him the sharks are killed for their meat and to make squaline from their oil which is used in cosmetic products sharks only give birth every other year so they are unable to breed as fast as they are being slaughtered for trade ‘ we need all our sharks as they help keep the ocean clean and in balance and every shark has a job in our ocean			1
for example , great whites help control the seal populations , tiger sharks help control the turtle populations , hammerheads help control the stingray populations and so on			1
‘ i spend a lot of time swimming with and interacting with sharks so they are more than just animals to me they are friends			0
‘ for me it 's extremely painful to see what 's happening			0
it makes me feel useless because it 's happening every day , it 's happening right now			0
sharks are killed for their meat , which is often cooked and eaten with fries in @entity160 shark teeth are sold commercially as tourist items and demand for such products fuels the industry of shark killing ‘ and unless we change how we feel about these animals and do something to help it will continue to happen until there are none left to care about			1
’ @entity173 mr @entity29 admits the future for sharks looks uncertain if the rate they are being harvested fails to slow - and claims to be certain some species will collapse commercially in the near future			0
he added : ‘ @entity34 just do n't breed fast enough to keep up with our commercial demands			0
by nature 's design sharks are only giving birth every other year and in some species sometimes only two pups			0
‘ commercial fishermen do n't take that into consideration when harvesting sharks , they have yearly quotas they have to meet , and they will fish for them until there is nothing left to fish			2
‘ @entity34 do n't have a chance against our technology , our boats and the amount of people targeting them			0
’ shark products are sold as souvenirs in tourist areas which increases the demand for shark fishing @entity207 footage shows the shark fins are laid out on the shore after they have been killed by fishermen at sea however it is not a fight mr @entity29 has given up on yet and insists people can still help save sharks by being more careful in what they buy			1
he said : ‘ the first thing is to stop buying shark products period			0
no shark tooth necklaces unless from a prehistoric shark , no shark steaks or imitation crab which is often made from shark			0
‘ fish and chips in @entity160 is often made from shark and people should stay away from makeup that does not use synthetic squaline - real squaline is made from shark oil			1
‘ there are also bigger shark movements going on in the world that @entity233 's are out there working on who always need support from the public to make their efforts a reality			0

animal rights activists claim shark populations will be *threatened*
