you ’ve heard of people who look like their pets , but how about people who look like their cars ? according to a study our faces can bear a striking resemblance to the front of our vehicles			1
and this apparently means that our pets , in turn , also look like our cars			0
researchers at @entity16 say cars look like their owners ( stock image shown )			1
they found people could associate owners with the front of their vehicles			1
this follows similar research that says people perceive faces in the front of vehicles - known as pareidolia the study was undertaken by @entity16 psychologists @entity30 and @entity31 , reports @entity32			1
it has long been said that dog owners look like their pets and it ’s a subject that has left scientists bemused for years			0
but researchers say that the resemblance is no coincidence and found strangers can identify owners and their dogs with an 80 per cent accuracy - and the clue is in the eyes			1
@entity48 psychologist @entity47 , of @entity49 in @entity48 , had been determined to resolve the idea after becoming doubtful over people ’s belief that there is any likeness			0
he took pictures of dogs and their owners at a ‘ dog lovers field festival ’ before asking 502 students to look at two sets of test sheets of the 20 dog - owner pairs with their faces @entity62 – one sheet was a real pair while other was fake			1
they were also put into four different ‘ masking ’ situations where they were shown either the entire face or versions that had certain features covered , for example the eyes or the mouth			0
participants were simply asked ‘ choose the dog - owner pairs that physically resemble each other ’			0
in the trial showing the full face , 80 per cent picked the correct pairing			0
the group that was only shown the dogs and owners with a panel covering the mouth scored 73 per cent			2
in the research they found that , when looked at from the front , cars seemed to resemble their owners			1
this follows similar research that says people perceive faces in the front of vehicles - known as pareidolia			1
‘ the initial idea was born as i was reading the article about “ dogs do resemble their owners , ” ’ @entity30 tells @entity102			2
‘ i thought , this could also replicate when using cars instead of dogs			2
this was some sort of everyday hypothesis because i frequently found that cars , to some extent , resemble their owners			1
’ in the study they rook 30 black and white photos of car owners and the front of their cars			1
one prerequisite though was that the owners had not been given the car as a gift , but had bought it for themselves			2
they then placed the real owner among images of several others who did n’t own the car , and they asked 160 participants to identify who was most likely to own the car on a scale of one to six ( most to least likely )			2
they found that people would assign particular traits to people and , more often than not , guessed correctly			0
‘ the real owner was in fact assigned rank 1 most frequently and rank 6 least frequently , ’ the researchers write			0
however , they add that sex and age were not considered important factors , with the face being the main indicator			0
think @entity140 ( left ) looks like the @entity141 she sold recently ( right ) ? the study involved asking volunteers to look at a selection of people			1
one was the owner and the rest were not , with the volunteers selecting the right person more often than other options spoiler alert : one of the people here is the correct owner , while the other five are incorrect			1
why not have a go at guessing who the right person is before you read more of this caption , as we 'll reveal the answer at the end			0
if you guessed the man in the top left , you 'd be correct they proved this by repeating the test for volunteers but showing them the side or back of the car instead			0
this time they were much less accurate in their guesses , suggesting that the appearance of the front of the car as compared to faces was the most important factor			0
the results of the study suggest that people are buying cars that look like themselves			2
and in a further study , the psychologists repeated the research with dogs - and found the same results when they viewed cars from the fronts			1
there was one stipulation , however - they could only achieve this feat for purebeed dogs , and not mixed breeds			0
of the overall research @entity30 said : ‘ i was surprised , indeed			0
‘ this was the reason why we replicated it further two times			0
but what surprised me most was that the effect basically remained after controlling for possible stereotypes			0
’ this graph shows how a score of 1 , most likely to own the car , was selected for the real owner more often than other options			2
the research goes on to say that dogs also look like their owner 's car			1
the researchers ruled out other facts that might have influenced the study			1
