when @entity1 first touched down on @entity2 , internet pranksters were quick to mock up photographs of alien life on the alien landscape			1
but it seems @entity7 has itself captured something very strange on camera , including a strange white light dancing across the horizon of the red planet , and four blobs hovering in the sky while the images are certainly a curiosity , @entity7 and photography experts insist that these are nothing more than blemishes on the images , picked up by the camera lens sitting on the rover at a distance of 350 million miles away			1
so what are the @entity2 anomalies ? view the videos below : 1 ) some internet users claim to be able to see a speck of light rapidly traversing the @entity2 horizon n the images below 2 ) it may not look like much , but on the dry and barren @entity2 landscape , any movement is unexpected - and some claim to be able to see a light which apparently lifts itself off the ground below 3 ) on some returned images from the @entity1 , strange pinpoints appear in the sky - are they spaceships , or just abnormalities on the camera ? the @entity2 landscape : but what is that hovering over the background ? dots appear to float in the sky , leading some observers to suggest an alien presence an inverse colour image shows the ' @entity51 's in sharper detail : experts say these are ' dead pixels ' on the camera - others are not so sure so far , @entity7 has not commented on any of the strange sightings , but alien hunters have suggested these are alien ships monitoring our baby steps into the universe			1
@entity62 user @entity61 , part of a group called @entity65 , spotted the anomalies on the @entity7 images , publicly available on the space agency 's website , and applied a series of filters to try to shed light on the mystery			2
referring to the four pin - points of light pictured in the skies of @entity2 ( below ) , he said : ' four objects caught by @entity1 , very difficult to make out on original image so i have used a few filters to highlight			1
' what are these four objects ? ufos , dust particles , or something else ? as always you decide			0
' however video analyst @entity86 - who , in the interests of full disclosure , has worked on projects for the @entity91 government - told the @entity92 that these are simply ' dead pixels ' in the image - a regular problem in the world of graphics			0
indeed , many computers and mobile phones develop dead pixel problems , as do modern digital camera			2
@entity86 said : ' after watching the video , it is actually quite clear that these are one - pixel sized image anomalies			0
' i fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager			0
' @entity109 [ cameras ] have them , and in a bland atmosphere like that at @entity2 , they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like @entity115 , where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone noticed them			1
' another video appears to show an object rising from the horizon , followed shortly afterwards by another small object			0
@entity7 has not publicly commented on either ' sighting '			0
@entity1 , a six - wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car , landed inside a vast , ancient impact crater near @entity2 ' equator on august 6 after an eight - month , 354 - million - mile voyage through space			1
earlier today , the rover was seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of @entity2			1
engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one - ton vehicle 's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days			0
the @entity2 motor was also shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time			1
the 7 - foot - long ( 2.1 - meter - long ) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera , a drill , a spectrometer , a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered rock and soil			2
the @entity1 zapped its first rock on sunday with a high - powered laser gun designed to analyze @entity2 mineral content , and scientists declared their target practice a success			2
the robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist - sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10 - second period , @entity7 said in a statement issued from mission control at the @entity171 near @entity172			0
the strange shimmering lights seen by @entity1 : the original image from the @entity7 website : the ' ufos ' are faint in this image , but observable through adjusting the contrast and brightness the @entity62 video - posted by a @entity181 - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence			2
a fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image a close - up of the blobs : are these glitches in the images - or something a bit more exciting ? decide for yourself : ufos or dead pixels ?			0

@entity51 hunters claim to have spotted lights in the @entity2 sky
experts insist they are nothing more than blemishes on the camera
