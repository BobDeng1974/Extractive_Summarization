by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 12 november 2012 the grainy video footage reveals a woman frail yet unbowed			1
in a series of intimate scenes we see her in her dressing gown ; moving with the aid of a walking frame ; performing her daily exercises			1
we can not see her face but the flaxen hair is instantly recognisable , certainly to the millions of @entity13 who watched this footage first on @entity16 and then on their television screens			1
for this is their former prime minister , @entity18 , in her cell in the @entity21 5 in @entity22 , known locally as the @entity23			1
video grab from a @entity23 tv station showing the jailed opposition leader @entity18 in her prison cell at least six cameras record every minute of the opposition leader 's day			1
already a gross invasion of privacy , last month video captured by the cameras was uploaded on to the internet in a bid to humiliate her in the run - up to the country 's parliamentary elections			1
though in prison , she still forms the main opposition to the president , @entity43			1
last week , @entity18 's daughter @entity44 , 32 , travelled to @entity45 to meet with human rights lawyer @entity46 to put together an appeal to the @entity48			1
she also came to plead for @entity50 's help , admitting that she wakes each morning terrified that this will be the day she learns her mother has died			1
@entity53 is her mother 's daughter , with the same blonde locks , penetrating brown eyes and determination			1
' my mother is under 24 - hour surveillance			1
it is like a mental torture			1
they 're trying to break her morale , to get her to give in and say , “ i 'm out of politics			1
” ' former @entity23 prime minister @entity18 during a trial hearing at the @entity70 in @entity71 , in july last year @entity18 , the heroine of @entity13 's @entity72 , was sentenced to seven years in prison in october 2011 for supposedly abusing her powers as prime minister when she forced through a 2009 gas deal with @entity78			1
the charges are widely acknowledged to be politically motivated , a way of removing her from public life			1
but 51 - year - old @entity18 refused to go quietly			1
still head of her fatherland party , she denounces the president as a crook and a dictator			1
in jail , she has been refused treatment for a serious spinal condition , and was attacked by prison guards in may , provoking worldwide condemnation			1
it is for this reason that @entity53 believes the authorities are trying to crush her mother			1
' she 's isolated from family , colleagues , friends : she 's not given access to the phone			1
it 's illegal to deny her phone calls but they do			1
all the time , in the cell , she has video cameras			2
she has done since her arrest , but the number of devices has increased exponentially			2
' @entity44 says her mother has been denied every last vestige of privacy			2
' we organised for her to have physio for her back			2
it meant she had to undress			2
the camera was over the bed			2
she asked if they would cover it during the treatment			2
they refused so she refused to have the treatment			2
' @entity18 was first held in jail in @entity71 , before being transferred to @entity22			1
@entity44 says of the cameras in her mother 's cell : ' whenever she finds a spot where they ca n't see what she 's doing , maybe where she can crouch down so she ca n't be seen , they put another one there			2
' @entity18 's family and supporters learnt there were six cameras keeping watch on her at all times			1
' we appealed to the court and the penitentiary said , “ yes we know about these six cameras but the other three we do n't know who put them there			2
” ' the authorities deny putting the footage in the public domain , yet it has been used by her opponents to suggest that @entity18 's medical condition is not as bad as she has suggested			1
@entity53 is incensed by such doubts			2
they 're trying to say , “ look , here she is doing exercises , there is nothing drastic			2
” i tell you what is drastic			2
one guard showed her a hidden camera , above her shower			2
so they always see her , even in the shower , the toilet , everywhere			2
' images of @entity18 doing exercises have been used by her opponents to suggest her medical condition is not as bad as she has suggested after the footage went on @entity16 , all the tv channels in @entity13 , which are owned by oligarchs linked to the president , began broadcasting it			1
in another clip , @entity18 bangs on a door			1
@entity44 says the release of the video proved to be a mistake by her mother 's enemies			2
she explains : ' she has the right to meet with her party colleagues every month			2
before the elections it was very important but , when they arrived , the guards would n't let them in			0
so in protest she started banging			0
the people loved it , they said we see her spirit , she still has her strength and power to fight			0
' @entity43 won the election amid allegations of flagrant vote - rigging			0
@entity18 is determined to oppose the results , which were described by international observers as a ' backward step for democracy '			1
many countries have spoken out against @entity211 's regime , but @entity45 has been markedly silent			0
@entity44 says : ' we 're really trying to understand the position of the @entity214			0
since her arrest my mother 's political team have met so many people , so many prime ministers , presidents , from @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224			0
they have all been so helpful			0
' maybe through this interview i could appeal to prime minister @entity50 to meet @entity211 or his foreign minister to talk about this			1
' it would be a signal to the @entity23 government that we can not accept this violation of human rights , these election violations of everything democracy should stand for			1
' we would really appreciate it if the prime minister would give this case attention and make his opinion public			0
that would really help us in our fight			0
' the day after the october 29 election , @entity18 announced she was going on hunger strike and has only had water since			1
@entity44 says : ' i went to see her and asked her to stop but she 's determined			0
no one can talk her into giving up			0
at least six cameras record every minute of the opposition leader 's day after the footage went on @entity16 , all the tv channels in @entity13 , which are owned by oligarchs linked to the president , began broadcasting it ' for her it 's the only thing she can do , to protest			0
she can not talk , she can not appeal , her voice is blocked			0
she said , “ you understand if i do n't do it , people who voted for me , the democratic opposition , will be disillusioned			0
by me doing this i am showing them i will fight to the end for their rights			1
” sacrificing her freedom was one of the costs – really high costs – she paid for this			0
' but @entity53 has paid too			0
her father , @entity271 , had to leave @entity13 before he was arrested and was granted asylum in the @entity274			0
educated at @entity275 and the @entity276 , @entity53 ran two restaurants in @entity13 but has rented them out so she can devote herself to the campaign			0
she never takes a break and can reel off articles of the @entity282 the way others might talk about books or films			0
@entity287 is appealin to @entity50 for help with her mother 's plight she travels the world , lobbying for her mother , but insists she will never go into politics			1
she 's already lost too much to it			0
' i try not to think deeply about this , ' she says , her composure crumbling for a second			0
' because if i start then i will lose my hope , my power to go on			0
our only dream is to have her back , for us to be left alone as a family			0
i want her to go back to being a mum , but she 's always been , for as long as i can remember , fighting and choosing not easy roads			0
' each day @entity53 dreads it might be the day her mother dies			0
she says : ' every morning i wake up with a feeling of horror			0
until i – or somebody – goes to see her , that horror does n't go away			0
' at 12 o'clock , that 's the earliest time we can see her			0
until then , each morning , it 's critical			0
she does n't have any contact with us			0
' if something was to happen to her , nobody would notify us , they would probably try to cover their tracks			0
' that is why i 'm appealing to @entity50 for help			1
' @entity45 has stood for justice for centuries			0
we always aspire to their standards , especially on human rights			1
we need their help to release not only my mother but all political prisoners in @entity13			0
because their lives are in danger			0
