a lineman who suits up for the @entity1 obviously knows his x 's and @entity3 's because he made it to the @entity5 - but it 's pretty clear this particular player is also quite familiar with the number line			1
offensive guard @entity8 recently had a math research paper published in the @entity10			1
the 23 - year - old pro , who goes by @entity12 on @entity13 after graduating from @entity14 with a 4.0 gpa and a master 's degree in math , also competed in a chess tournament for the first time earlier this month			1
a portion of the abstract reads : ' in this paper , we develop a cascadic multigrid algorithm for fast computation of the @entity42 vector of a graph @entity44 , namely , the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue			0
' this vector has been found to have applications in fields such as graph partitioning and graph drawing			0
' the paper was published on march 17 , just three days after @entity53			2
@entity8 , who refers to himself as a published mathematician and professional mathlete , celebrated both occasions on @entity13			1
the 23 - year - old pro posts many math - related things while using the handle @entity12 on @entity13 on march 14 , he wrote : ' @entity60 ! ! ! ! ' take some time to check out all of its properties and the amazing things it 's involved in			1
' my favorite is @entity68 's identity			0
' earlier in the month , he posted about competing in the @entity70			2
@entity8 wrote : ' @entity71 finished my first chess tournament ever			0
' scored 3 points in five rounds in the @entity75 of the @entity70 ! ! ! ' he wears no. 64 because eight to the power of two is a perfect square , @entity76 reported			1
@entity8 said : ' it 's a very nice number			2
' with football and math , i 'm very precise			0
with everything else , i 'm a simple guy			0

23 - year - old had 4.0 gpa during graduation from @entity14
he helped teach @entity93 math class and @entity13 handle is @entity12
competed in the @entity75 section of the @entity70 @entity70
paper he worked on was published in @entity10
