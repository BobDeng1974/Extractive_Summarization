any move by our national game to bring back football in place of professional wrestling can expect the support of @entity7			1
when @entity9 ’s president revealed exclusively to me in an interview screened at the @entity13 convention in @entity14 that he would be pioneering more new technology , we also discussed the plague of arm - grappling , head - locking , shirt - pulling and body slamming which is infecting and disfiguring the beautiful game			1
having disclosed his plans for following up goal - line technology with video challenges by managers and coaches against refereeing decisions , @entity7 addressed the epidemic use of arms in challenges , saying : ‘ this is the next issue we need to examine			1
’ @entity32 has now launched a campaign entitled @entity34 , which highlights how this abuse of the laws and spirit of the game is at its ugliest from corners and free kicks			1
this penalty box incident caused controversy in sunday 's @entity45 vs @entity47 clash - on the left , @entity42 wrestles with @entity49 while on the right , @entity50 grapples @entity52 this reverse angle shows @entity52 push @entity50 to the floor while @entity49 can be seen with his arm around the neck of @entity42 in the background proposals are being tabled for a summit meeting between leading referees and officials of the @entity62 , the @entity63 and @entity64 and the @entity65			1
since the laws of the game already prohibit the use of hands and arms , all it will take is for a consensus to be reached			2
then club managers can be advised how rules are to be applied more strictly			0
no matter how draconian the implementation of the regulations , they can act confident of approval from the governing body of the world game			0
in fact , they can set an example to be followed around the planet , all the way up to @entity85			2
@entity7 added : ‘ the name of the game is football and that needs to be respected			1
’ @entity91 's @entity90 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity95 's @entity94 last week @entity97 's @entity96 has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking similarly , the proper art of defending needs to be revived			2
attacking the ball rather than the opponent , clever positioning and well - timed tackling without loss of balance are skills being substituted by primitive tactics more suited to the @entity108			0
there is a revealing sequence of photographs which show @entity112 relieving @entity113 of the ball with an intervention of such immaculate precision that @entity118 ’s @entity117 - winning captain kept his footing throughout			0
if the most gifted of all @entity121 footballers – and one of the greatest of all time – could be dispossessed with such brilliant dexterity while in full flight , it should not be beyond today ’s super-fit defenders to deny comparatively lesser forwards without dragging them bodily to the ground			0
@entity112 ( right ) shows how it should be done , tackling @entity47 's @entity132 in 1970 @entity7 ( left ) and @entity133 spoke at length about the weighty issues facing the beautiful game cynically , the most blatant culprits are those who end to badger the referees to their faces whenever decisions go against them			1
that is another ill of which the game needs curing			0
but one step at a time			0
it is the wrestling which is spoiling our game as a spectacle			2
so @entity150 - and all over the pitch for the matter .			0

@entity32 has launched a campaign to stop @entity156 footballers wrestling , grappling and shirt pulling opponents in the penalty box
our campaign is called @entity34
any efforts to remove wrestling from the professional game can expect @entity7 's support
' this is the next issue we need to examine , ' @entity7 exclusively told me
the @entity156 and @entity173 can start a wave of reform which goes across the globe and will be *enacted* at @entity85
