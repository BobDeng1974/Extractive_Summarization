by @entity0 published : 23:14 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 08:16 est , 8 november 2013 on december 29th of last year in the small mining town of @entity2 , @entity3 , a 13 - year - old boy and his 10 - year - old sister walking under a railway bridge came upon the half - frozen body of man carrying only his @entity9 , a piece of paper with a @entity12 phone number and a check for $ 54,000			1
the mystery only deepened when it was discovered that the hypothermia victim was 60 - year - old @entity17 , a long - lost relative of the reclusive and eccentric @entity19 heiress @entity18 who stood to inherit a share of $ 34.5 million from her $ 300 million fortune			1
disappearing from his basic rented accommodation nine months before , @entity17 managed to avoid the many private investigators who came looking for him as relatives of @entity25 scrambled in courts to get their share of her money			1
@entity2 , @entity3 , @entity32 - @entity31 , 13 and his sister @entity30 , 10 , look towards the overpass where they found @entity35 the morning of december 29th			1
when the man did n't respond , they ran home to tell their mom they 'd found a dead man but why did a man who stood to inherit so much go out of his way to avoid it ? and what do those who briefly knew him say that says about his opinions on the battle for @entity18 's millions ? the search for these answers began with @entity19 photographer , @entity53			1
intrigued as to how such an apparent man of means and fortune could fall through the cracks of society and die cold and alone , @entity53 set off to rural @entity2 to discover as much of the truth as he could			1
all he had to start was the knowledge that the telephone number in his pocket belonged to his brother who had not heard from him since their mother 's funeral 20 years before			2
discovering @entity2 , population 12,359 , to be a stop for transients and truckers , @entity53 's search for the elusive life of @entity17 led him to the small apartment complex known as ' @entity74 '			1
it was here that @entity53 found @entity17 had no friends , only neighbors , some of whom lived next door to him for a decade , but frustratingly knew almost nothing about his life , let alone the fact he was heir to a multi-million fortune			1
paranoid : @entity85 had sporadic interactions with @entity17 and described him as paranoid , often whispering in conversations , ' he was kinda spooky , and he 'd come in at odd hours , but he 'd never do anything to hurt anyone			2
speaking to @entity90 , the owner of ' @entity74 ' , @entity53 discovered that the mining and copper heir had in fact left his apartment nine months before his death to live his life as a homeless hermit			1
' @entity97 lived here since 2002 , before he went off on his @entity100 phase , ' said @entity90			0
' he only ever talked to me and my son			0
never did i see him talk to anyone else			0
he was a complete loner			0
but sometimes we 'd shoot the breeze or talk mechanics			0
' gaining access into @entity17 's still relatively well - preserved apartment , @entity53 found that @entity17 had been hoarding scrap metal and had seemingly become obsessed with building or designing experimental aircraft - just like @entity100			1
hoarder : @entity115 's old apartment in the @entity74 , where he had been hoarding copper and aluminum scrap metal			2
' @entity118 and i spent days cleaning it out '' , said @entity90			0
' it was piled up to the ceiling			0
we hauled off two truckloads			0
lucky it did n't collapse the damn floor			0
' as he looked at the addresses on unopened letters , the photographer found that @entity17 had been renting an office in town for the past ten years too			1
the 40 - page settlement that was accepted in @entity134 's @entity133 in september combines elements from @entity18 's two wills from 2005 and includes : $ 34.5 million for @entity25 's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress $ 11.5 million for the relatives ' legal fees $ 85 million home in @entity142 , @entity12 and @entity25 's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation , the @entity145 , which was set up by the will $ 4.5 million cash for the art foundation $ 1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation $ 3.5 million for @entity25 's goddaughter , @entity151 , who wrote to her throughout her life $ 10 million for the @entity154 in @entity155 $ 1 million for the @entity156 , where @entity25 lived for 20 years $ 0 for @entity157 , the private nurse who had originally been in line for $ 30 million			1
she must also pay back $ 5 million in gifts $ 0 for @entity25 's attorney , @entity161 , and her accountant , @entity163 , who had been in line for $ 500,000 @entity85 the owner , also told a similar tale of a loner , with no friends , who while not threatening was certainly eccentric , to say the least			1
i think he mostly used it as a place to have mail sent , but for a time he was doing work , ' said @entity85			0
' something with computers and voice recognition , and i remember when he found out someone else had already done it , he was upset , because his plan was to be first in that			2
' @entity85 described him to @entity53 as paranoid , often whispering in conversations , ' he was kinda spooky , and he 'd come in at odd hours , but he 'd never do anything to hurt anyone ... there used to be aa meetings in the basement here			2
' i think that 's why he wanted this office			2
i also know he sponsored some kids in @entity193 , maybe @entity194			0
' it is still unknown where and how @entity17 accessed or indeed got his money from			2
no bank accounts have been found and the source of the $ 54,000 check to cash found in his pocket has never been properly accounted for			1
@entity90 believed that his obsession with collecting scrap metal holds the deepest fascination for him now he knows who his reclusive tenant really was			0
@entity17 was the great - grandson of former @entity32 senator @entity25 , who made his reputation as one of the copper kings of @entity212 , who also diversified into banking , building , railroads and reserves special fame as the founder of @entity220			1
since the death of @entity225 in 2011 and left all her money to doctors and nurses , the remnants of her family have been fighting in the courts to claim what they believe to be their fair share			2
in her will , @entity232 bequeathed no money at all to her family , leaving it all instead to her nurse , goddaughter , attorney , accountant , hospital , doctor , favourite museum and various employees and an art foundation she wanted established at her oceanfront estate in @entity142 , @entity12			2
it is thought that not one of her relatives had seen her in 40 years , although some had tried to keep contact with her through holiday cards and the occasional phone calls			2
because they did not receive a penny in her will , 19 of @entity25 's relatives stepped forward to challenge her will in a @entity19 court			1
a public administrator joined in on behalf of @entity17 who lawyers had tried to contact about the battle , but all they could find were belongings abandoned in a storage locker - private investigators were not able to find him			1
indeed , even if investigators could not contact @entity17 and he had been granted a share of the massive inheritance , his spouse or children would have been entitled to it - however he had no wife or kids			2
a homeless @entity272 vet in @entity2 who encountered @entity17 several times but asked not to be named			1
in between quotes from @entity274 , he described meeting @entity17 in the fall under the same bridge where he was later found dead			1
' @entity97 was already there , and he was n't very welcoming , so i went elsewhere			0
' in september of this year , members of the family eventually won $ 34.5 million after the lengthy legal battle concluded			2
' i got the impression @entity97 resented the family … thought they 'd squandered the money			0
i think he was ashamed			0
what is known is @entity17 left ' @entity287 ' to live under the railway overpass where he eventually was found dead by @entity31 , 13 and his sister @entity30 , 10			1
a @entity272 veteran who also calls the bridge home told @entity53 that he ran into @entity17 a couple of times over the last few months of his life			1
' i never saw him rise from his bedroll ; i was n't sure he could even stand up			0
' i tried once to bring him some clothes , and it was like ' he wanted them but did n't want them ' … on @entity301 i tried to get him to come get a hot meal in town , but he would n't budge			0
' i eventually asked if he intended to stay under that bridge all winter , and he said to me , ' that would n't be practical			0
' wealthy : @entity18 left an estate valued at $ 306.5million when she died last year and ( right ) pictured with her father , industrialist and senator @entity25 and her sister ( far right ) last year , @entity17 's older brother , @entity312 , said that @entity97 had worked as a cowboy and lived in the @entity314 states most of his life			1
' he was homeless essentially , ' said @entity312 to @entity316			0
' if we had proper mental health services in this country , we could have notified and known to do something			0
' that rang true with @entity90 who said that ' @entity97 had equestrian knowledge , which was funny because my wife at the time worked on horses			0
he knew @entity327 had @entity328			0
he knew @entity329 had @entity330			0
' intriguingly , @entity53 found a strong independent streak ran through everything he discovered @entity17 had done in @entity2			1
people who spoke to him around town described a man who admired the book ' @entity337 ' about @entity338 and his adventure 's in @entity340			0
ultimately , @entity53 found @entity17 to be just as enigmatic as his relative @entity18 .			1

@entity17 , 60 , was the long - lost relative of @entity19 heiress @entity18 who died in 2011 leaving a $ 300 million will
he was found dead in mysterious circumstances under a bridge in @entity2 , in rural @entity3 in december
he was carrying a $ 54,000 check and had apparently been homeless , by *choice* , for nine months
relatives had *desperately* searched for him as they battled in courts to get their share of @entity25 's fortune
photographer @entity53 set off to find out the truth
