@entity0 touched down in @entity1 after catching a private jet ahead of the @entity4 final against @entity5			1
@entity7 's side go into the clash as heavy favourites at @entity10 to compete for the first piece of silverware this season			1
@entity14 is already showing his commitment to his new club by travelling to @entity1 and staying with the team at the @entity18			1
the former @entity20 midfielder , who is on a sixth month loan at @entity0 , will not be playing , however			2
watch scroll down for ' @entity7 : new signings wo n't be ready for @entity4 ' all aboard ! @entity0 caught a private jet ahead of their @entity4 clash against @entity5 sunshine : @entity26 chilled with a pair of sunglasses before boarding the plane it 's good to talk : @entity31 was pictured on the phone as @entity33 hobbled on a pair of crutches moving on up : @entity14 embarked on the jet ahead of manager @entity7 following him closely : @entity14 walked on with @entity0 coach @entity36 before travelling to @entity1 @entity33 also hopped aboard despite being on crutches , but it 's @entity38 who is really causing a stir			1
the midfielder insists he is not affected by ' stupid ' abuse from @entity5 fans - and has risked further stoking up the animosity by appearing to dismiss their title hopes			1
the midfielder moved from north @entity1 to the north - west in 2011 and has been a target of the @entity50 boo - boys whenever the sides have met since			0
but having won two @entity53 titles and a @entity54 in that time , scoring in the final of the latter as @entity0 defeated @entity57 last season , he is comfortable the move was the best thing for his career			2
' the abuse does n't affect me on the pitch , i just think it 's stupid , ' @entity38 said			1
'' i 'm not an @entity5 fan , i am not from @entity1			2
if we want to be honest , we are players who look at what is in the the best interests for us and our career			0
' when @entity0 came , it was the best choice for me to come here			0
and today i have won trophies , i am really happy , i have everything and i have a better life			0
' several former @entity5 colleagues have made the same move to @entity0 and @entity38 continued : ' if the fans ca n't move on then it 's too bad			1
they love their club , maybe they saw it as treason or that i betrayed them			0
but it 's not that			2
i just look at for what 's best for me ; and that 's what @entity87 did , @entity89 , @entity90			2
' @entity38 - who has all but confirmed his retirement from international football , having been left out of the @entity94 squad by coach @entity95 - does not appear concerned with building bridges with @entity5 fans either as he prepares to face them again in the @entity4			1
new deal : central defender @entity26 is to be offered a contract worth Â£ 60million over the next six years looking back : @entity7 gets on the plane alongside @entity38 , who has angered @entity5 fans recently assessing the new season 's title race , he acknowledged the ability of @entity107 signing @entity105 but feels the main threat to his side comes from elsewhere in @entity1			1
' i think @entity20 will be the biggest threat , ' he said			0
' for me , @entity5 still have a weakness in defensive mid ( field ) and at centre - back			2
' @entity20 's signings have really caught my eye			0
@entity117 is a great replacement for @entity14 , i know that from playing with him at @entity5			1
they had a weakness up front so they 've signed @entity122 who was great for @entity123 last season			0
they lost @entity126 but bought in @entity127			0
' for @entity5 , @entity105 has the quality , but the @entity53 is not @entity129			1
it is really , really hard			0
we saw that with @entity133 last year			0
at the start of the season he was brilliant but he found out when every other league has a break in december , you carry on playing in @entity139			0
we had the same with @entity140 at @entity0			0
