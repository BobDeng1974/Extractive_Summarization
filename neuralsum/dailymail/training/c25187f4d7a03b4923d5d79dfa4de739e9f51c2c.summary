a first glimpse of @entity1 always stirs the soul			2
it does n’t matter whether you are @entity5 being rowed over the sea by @entity7 , a present - day passenger on the ferry from @entity10 , or a driver on the arched bridge that carries the @entity13 over the @entity14			1
we had taken the latter option			2
as we left the @entity18 mainland behind , that swarthy mountain range @entity19 rose ahead , a range of russet and mauve crowned by sawtooth ridges – a siren call to anybody who loves hiking in @entity28 ’s wildest extremities			1
at the very edge of it all : @entity1 is an example of the @entity28 at its most wild and gloriously rugged that includes my wife @entity34 and me			2
we had scheduled four days to dip in and out of the @entity37 – an 80 - mile walking route between the tail and the right pincer of this lobster - shaped island			1
better still , we had parked in @entity42 , at the @entity44 ’s eastern edge – leaving @entity45 to take the strain			2
this @entity48 - based hiking specialist would drop us wherever we needed to be , collect us if necessary , and drive our bags between the hotels they had booked for us			1
an ideal way to squeeze the best out of the trail			0
with just dry clothes and sandwiches in our day packs , we set out from the remote settlement of @entity59 , with its tiny quay			0
the precarious coastal path around the headland of @entity63 na h - @entity64 was an instant wonder , showcasing views across the wind - harassed @entity67 to the @entity68			1
seals bobbed in the @entity71 swell , while quarrelsome gulls screeched above us			0
eventually we reached @entity73 , a wave - pounded beach of grey pebbles strewn with driftwood and crab husks			1
here , the pink - tinged granite @entity19 rises 3,000 feet out of the sea in majestic fashion our next section of the trail was @entity83 , following an ancient track through expanses of bog , heather and shimmering lochs the colour of whisky			1
munching our sandwiches atop a huge boulder next to a chattering burn , we watched white lines of water pouring down from the heights			0
red deer patrolled the lower slopes , and i still maintain that the speck wheeling in the distance was a golden eagle ( @entity34 remains sceptical )			0
best feet forward : the @entity37 runs for 80 miles across this most dramatic of islands we agreed , however , that the @entity104 – which sits next to an old stone bridge at the head of the glen – is a gem			1
@entity110 images of tweed - clad mountaineers adorn the walls , and there is still an old - fashioned feel to the place			1
it would be hard to imagine a more inspiring location			0
we watched a fine sunset from the adjacent @entity119 – in the company of hikers , campers and a ‘ library ’ of 300 malt whiskies			1
for all its rousing beauty , the landscape is speckled with reminders that @entity1 has seen cruel times – the roofless ruins of crofts left when the @entity132 aristocracy evicted small - scale famers from their land to make way for sheep during the 19th century ‘ clearances ’			1
we pondered this brutal piece of history while admiring the scenic drama of @entity141			0
' @entity142 , we are proud of our heritage			0
but there is still resentment about the clearances , if you ask the @entity149 - speaking old folk , ' said @entity150 , our taxi driver			2
we were on our way to @entity152 , the port from which thousands of evictees left for @entity155 and @entity156			0
nowadays @entity1 ’s largest town is a tourist hub , with shops selling hiking gear and hand - spun knitwear			1
hotels , restaurants and pastel - painted pubs line the horseshoe harbour			2
we strolled along the quayside , appetites sharpened after all the walking			0
@entity1 taps its natural larder superbly			0
i asked as to when the island ’s famously silky oysters are in season			2
“ any month with an r in it , ” came the reply from our beaming waitress – who , according to her name badge , was called " @entity178 "			0
just wonderful : @entity1 's @entity19 range throws its reflection into the waters of @entity185 nan @entity184 ' that includes @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , ' she added			1
we sucked on langoustines with hard shiny shells , landed just yards away , then tucked into braised lamb with asparagus and celery , everything locally grown			0
our final day ’s walking was over the craggy escarpment of @entity200 , on the north - east coast			1
the still more remote isle of @entity203 was in constant view as we neared the @entity205 – a remarkable outcrop of crumbling basalt			0
on our final evening , we sat by the sea , watching surf turn to smoke as waves battered otherworldly shapes sculpted by the elements over the centuries			0
these rock stars provide just our sort of nightlife , we decided			0
a five - night hiking break , taken between march and october , costs from £ 410 per person with @entity220 ( 0141 530 1950 , www.macsadventure.com )			1
the price includes accommodation with breakfast in hotels and guesthouses , baggage transfers , taxis , maps and emergency back - up .			2

this *fabled* island of dramatic scenery sits in the north - west of @entity18
it is home to the @entity37 - an 80 - mile hiking route past *pristine* lochs
hikers can gaze at the high mountain flanks of the @entity19 range
