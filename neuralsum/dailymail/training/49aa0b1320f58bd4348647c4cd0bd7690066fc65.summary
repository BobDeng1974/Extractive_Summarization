using a furniture business as a front and freight trains for shipping , two brothers built a major @entity7 drug ring that imported two tons of cocaine a month , newly unsealed documents reveal			1
@entity9 and @entity10 vanished into a witness protection program after giving testimony about their illicit enterprise , including their connection to the @entity17 and its leader @entity18			1
the testimony that produced indictments against more than a dozen drug traffickers , including ' @entity22 , ' was only revealed recently , shedding light on how the brothers invented numerous schemes to import drugs and smuggle cash back into @entity28			2
' from 2006 through 2008 , we were coordinating , at its peak , the distribution in @entity7 to our customer base of 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms of cocaine per month			0
' that dizzying amount of important narcotics brought in $ 60million per month and was coordinated with the help of @entity55 , who prosecutors allege was logistics chief for @entity22 's cartel			1
according to testimony , @entity55 facilitated transportation of cocaine into @entity28 with trucks , planes and ' narco subs , ' semi-submersible , often high - tech watercraft that could bring narcotics shipments from @entity68			2
747s with the seats removed could ferry up to 13 tons of contraband into @entity28 as well , using the cover of a ' humanitarian aid mission ' providing clothing in @entity74			0
the brothers also testified they gave @entity55 $ 600,000 to set up a importing and logistics business that shipped furniture into @entity28 via freight trains			1
@entity22 : the @entity10 brothers ' testimony helped bring indictments against the presumed leader of the @entity17 , @entity18 ' @entity22 ' @entity18 flying high : @entity22 used 747s like the one pictured in this file photo to transport cocaine from labs in @entity68 to @entity28 , where it made its way north submersible : cartels also use homemade ' narco subs , ' which can evade detection as they transport drugs to @entity28 from @entity68 once the trains were in @entity28 , however , what came back across the border were tons of cocaine - literal tons - with cash heading back			1
with the help of a ' crew ' based in @entity7 , the @entity10 brothers said they distributed the cocaine throughout the @entity105 , even reaching over the border into @entity107			1
' @entity31 and i maintained approximately 30 large customers for cocaine and heroin , ' @entity10 's testimony reads , with buyers in @entity7 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			1
in the transcript of an audio recording also released , @entity55 appears to speak about trying out a @entity124 belonging to @entity22 's son			2
' i drive it during the day , so it can be seen			0
otherwise , what the f â€” is it for then ? ' @entity55 pleaded guilty in april to one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics , and though he claims he 's never met @entity22 , prosecutors allege he 's known the kingpin since childhood and is one of his closest lieutenants			2
though he was arrested by the @entity138 in 1993 and extradited to @entity28 , @entity22 escaped custody in 2001 by hiding in the laundry cart and being wheeled to freedom			0
over more than a decade , he eluded law enforcement , reportedly spending most of his time in the mountainous regions around @entity36 , reported @entity114			0
with the aid of a few trusted lieutenants , @entity22 continued to run his lucrative narcotics business , with the city of @entity7 announcing him to be @entity149 in 2013			1
finally , in 2014 , he was brought down by the @entity151 's special forces in a joint operation with @entity105 officials , though it still remains to be seen whether he will be extradited to the @entity105 to face charges			0
the @entity10 brothers have gone into protective custody , with their extended family moved from @entity28 to protect them from retribution			0
' i know that once the people i have talked about today found out i was cooperating , ' @entity10 says in his testimony , ' they would try to kill me and my family			0

@entity9 and @entity10 distributed narcotics shipped from the @entity17 throughout @entity164
their contact was a man named @entity169 , who allegedly ran logistics for the cartel 's leader , @entity18 ' @entity22 ' @entity18
with an *investment* from the brothers , @entity55 began a furniture importing business , using the cover to ship cocaine by freight train
the walls of rail cars would be lined with cocaine , then sent up to @entity7 to be distributed , cash flowed in the *opposite* direction
after his 2013 escape from prison , @entity22 , directed cartel business while hiding in the mountains
