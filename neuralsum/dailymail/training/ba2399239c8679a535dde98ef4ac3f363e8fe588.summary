by @entity0 a group of @entity3 supporters have raised £ 840 to fund an aeroplane to fly over @entity5 with an @entity7 message			1
the supporters have put the money together to hire the plane with the order : ‘ @entity12 – @entity13 ’ to go overhead during saturday 's @entity16 home match against @entity17			1
it is a direct challenge to the @entity20 group , who say they will not take down the ' @entity23 ' banner inside @entity5			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity25 react to this season 's @entity3 defeats get the message : @entity25 is being targeted by fans because of @entity3 's woeful season grounds for concern : the plane will fly over @entity5 during saturday 's match against @entity17 keeping watch : the @entity25 banner will stay up at @entity5 for now contrast : @entity7 ( left ) holds his head in his hands as the @entity41 bench go wild in the derby @entity20 spokesman @entity43 on why they 're keeping the @entity45 ' @entity23 ' banner - for now the @entity47 website , who first reported the plans , said : ' the message is a response to the @entity20 banner which reads " @entity53 "			1
following @entity3 ’s 3 - 0 defeat against @entity41 yesterday , stewards were sent to protect the banner at full time , after there were concerns that fans would want to remove it			1
' ' as yet , there have been no public protests within the ground , home or away , but it is expected that will change at the weekend when @entity3 face @entity17			1
' @entity43 of @entity20 told @entity68 that the group had thought about taking the banner down but ultimately decided to keep it up			1
he explained : ' it ’s rare that we commission banners for a player or manager who has just arrived			0
certainly it ’s almost unheard of that we would do one for someone who had n’t won or achieved anything with us			0
but we thought the @entity25 situation was different			1
' when he arrived , we had been urged by sir @entity82 to support him and this was just one of the ways we felt we could do that			0
now we are under some pressure to take it down			2
discontent : one supporter looks angry as he passes @entity7 and his staff ' the words " @entity53 " came from a rank - and - file @entity3 fan and we took it and ran with it			1
it was appropriate that it was first hung for the visit of @entity97 and @entity98 at the first home game of the season			0
we knew the " @entity106 " had wanted the @entity3 job and this was our way of telling him we had chosen someone else			1
' ' the feedback was largely good			0
a few people moaned that @entity7 should n’t get a banner until he had won something but on the whole the banner proved very popular , both as a concept and in terms of the wording			2
' all in all it probably cost about £ 500 to make and hang and all that cash came from supporters			2
some may donate a pound , someone else may donate £ 50			0
it ’s the way it always is			0
' over the course of the season there have been some moans and groans about results but the talk about removing the banner only really gathered pace on the sunday and monday ahead of the @entity134 home game			2
people started to get in touch on @entity137 and other social media asking us to take it down			0
taunt : @entity143 fans mock @entity144 with this message about @entity146 after the @entity144 ' relegation ' as we speak , there are still calls for us to remove it			2
there are polls saying that more than 90 per cent of fans want it down			0
but 90 per cent of how many ? is that truly representative of the average @entity3 fan ? i ’m not sure it is			1
' what we do n’t want to do is anything knee - jerk			2
so the banner will stay for now			0
it will stay for the @entity17 game on saturday and it will stay for @entity164			1
as i said before , the focus should be on the team ahead of the @entity164 game in particular			0
' there has been nothing particularly visible or verbal against @entity7 during games at @entity5			0
no ‘ @entity13 ’ flags or anything			1
so we do n’t think it ’s our place to initiate some kind of campaign for his sacking by taking his banner down			0
' planes are usually used by fans to taunt opponents , such as when @entity143 supporters flew a message over the @entity186 mocking relegated @entity144 and thanking their manager @entity146			2
they are even sometimes used by players - in the 1980s @entity190 striker @entity189 hired one to mock relegated rivals @entity191 .			0

a group of @entity3 supporters have put the money together to hire plane
it will bear the message : ' *wrong* one : @entity13 ' during saturday 's @entity16 match against @entity17
the *decision* is a challenge to @entity20 ' ' @entity23 ' banner
@entity20 say they will be keeping that banner up - for now
