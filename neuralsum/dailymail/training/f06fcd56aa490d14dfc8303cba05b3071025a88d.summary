@entity0 and the foreign secretary @entity1 today vowed not to send any troops to @entity3 - despite the country descending into bloody anarchy			1

a spokeswoman for the prime minister said : ' we have been clear that we wo n't be getting involved in putting boots on the ground militarily in this situation			1
' foreign secretary @entity1 added : ' we are not planning a @entity16 military intervention			1
' @entity0 and @entity1 today both insisted there would be no @entity16 military involvement in @entity3 the intervention came after the @entity22 president @entity21 refused to rule out ordering a bombing campaign - but said : ' we will not be sending @entity22 troops back into combat in @entity3			1
' mr @entity1 said @entity16 might help the wobbling @entity3 government with counter-terrorism expertise			1
speaking after talks on @entity3 with @entity22 secretary of state @entity30 in @entity31 , the foreign secretary added that a team from the @entity33 was now on the ground in northern @entity3 to see what humanitarian help the @entity16 could give			1
mr @entity1 said : ' we are looking urgently at ways to help - for example with counter-terrorism expertise			2
' work is under way on that now and we will continue to liaise closely with our @entity22 allies in particular on that			0
' we will also continue to work urgently within the @entity46 to help concert the wider international response			0
' the prime minister meanwhile this morning held talks with the secretary general of @entity52 , @entity53 , about the crisis			1
militants from the @entity60 - inspired @entity59 who earlier this week seized large areas of @entity3 's @entity64 heartland , including the cities of @entity66 and @entity67 , have now captured two towns north - east of the capital @entity57 , local officials said			2
mr @entity1 said that the situation was ' extremely serious , but added that , while fighting continues , ' attacks have thankfully slowed in recent hours '			0
he said that @entity16 had three priorities in @entity3 : ' first of all to stabilise the situation			2
this is primarily the responsibility of the @entity3 security forces , working in co-operation with their civilian authorities , including the @entity80 regional government			0
' secondly for @entity3 's leaders to come together in a united response this brutal aggression against their country			2
that requires their leaders to find ways immediately to put aside their differences , however strongly felt , and act together against the terrorism which threatens them all			0
' third , the half a million or more displaced people in the north who have been forced to flee @entity66 and the surrounding areas need urgent support so that the humanitarian situation does not deteriorate further			0
' president @entity21 rejected the prospect of boots on the ground at a speech from the @entity101 of the @entity102 in @entity103 today his remarks came before president @entity21 ended speculation that the @entity22 could send troops back into the country to halt the jihadists ' advance			1
he said he was considering a ' range of other options ' - but not boots on the ground			0
the president said : ' we will not be sending @entity22 troops back into combat in @entity3 , but i have asked my national security team to prepare a range of other options that could help support @entity3 ’s security forces and i will be reviewing those options in the days ahead			1
' i do want to be clear , though : this is not solely , or even primarily , a military challenge			0
over the past decade , @entity22 troops have made extraordinary sacrifices to give @entity3 an opportunity to claim their own future			2
' unfortunately @entity3 ’s leaders have been unable to overcome too often the mistrust and sectarian differences that have long been simmering there and that ’s created vulnerabilities within the @entity3 government as well as their security forces			0
' so any action that we may take to provide assistance to @entity3 security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by @entity3 ’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences , to promote stability and account for the legitimate interests of all of @entity3 ’s communities and to continue to build the capacity of an effective security force			0
we ca n’t do it for them			0
