@entity0 aimed to put their @entity2 loss behind them as they trained ahead of their @entity5 opener against @entity6			1
@entity8 's side were disappointing in their 3 - 0 defeat to @entity10 , but both the morale and the motivation appeared to have returned as they trained at @entity13			1
@entity14 and @entity15 were among a host of players unavailable to play on sunday , but both were pictured training today and could play against @entity6			1
the @entity21 manager spoke about his squad , and what he thinks will be different this year			0
he told @entity24 : ' last year we were in a different position than now			0
now maybe i know the players a little more			0
they know me , they know the way i want to play			0
' @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity14 and @entity45 are five players that give us something very important in defence and i hope attacking-wise we will be the same as last year because we have four important strikers and good midfielders			1
' @entity14 is a very important player for us			2
he has a lot of experience , he is a very important @entity55 player			0
' he had nothing to do until january with @entity57 – i proposed to him that he come here because i think he is a great player			0
' @entity58 : @entity59 played against @entity10 but @entity15 was not considered fit enough meanwhile , manager @entity8 admitted he must trim his squad before adding any further recruits , as @entity0 fight to comply with @entity63 constraints			1
@entity66 capture @entity45 could be @entity0 's final summer signing unless the club can offload @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity8 conceded			1
' it 's not finished , until the last day we can do different things , ' said @entity8 at the @entity5 launch			1
' but if you ask me at this moment if i am happy with the squad , yes i am very happy with my squad			0
happy : there were rumours that @entity82 wanted to quit the champions but the @entity84 refuted them ' we had a lot of problems also with @entity63 with the restriction of the amount of players we can put in our squad			0
' so maybe i do n't think that we are going to sign another player because we can not do it			0
' we have maybe too many players in the squad at this moment , players that need to play , that 's very important , especially for young players			2
' @entity70 or maybe @entity69 , they may need to play in a different team , so we 'll see from now until the end of the transfer window what happens with our squad			0
' but at this moment , yes we have too many players			0
' form : after @entity105 and @entity106 were injured last season , @entity104 had a good run of form @entity8 has added @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity110 , @entity14 and @entity111 to the champions ' squad , along with @entity45 this summer			1
city expect to stay within the £ 49million spending limit imposed by @entity116 for last term 's @entity63 breaches , while @entity8 is also mindful of sticking to the reduced 21 - man squad cap			1
@entity120 are understood to be keen on completing a permanent deal for 22 - year - old @entity122 forward @entity70 , who enjoyed a loan stint with the @entity125 club in 2011 - 12			0
@entity69 joined @entity0 from @entity126 in 2012 , but has made just three starts in his two years at the @entity128			2
competition : @entity130 faces competition from @entity110 for his starting place this season the 25 - year - old admitted after sunday 's 3 - 0 @entity2 defeat to @entity10 that he would seek a move if he can not secure regular first - team football			1
refusing to prioritise the @entity137 this term , @entity8 said @entity0 can not use @entity63 constraints as an excuse			1
' it 's easy to give excuses , but i do n't like to do that , ' he said			2
' i 'll always field the strongest team and we want to win every time we play , and in every competition			0
retired : @entity148 , who has retired from international football , had a poor game against his former club ' you do n't have five or six teams in any other major league where any one of them can win the title			2
' so the @entity5 is still the most important league , and it 's important for us also			1
' @entity0 start the defence of their @entity5 title by facing @entity6 at @entity160 on sunday			1
@entity8 admitted he is yet to rule on whether to restore @entity130 to his line - up after omitting the @entity163 goalkeeper from the @entity2 starting team			1
@entity165 keeper @entity44 made his club debut in the @entity10 defeat at @entity168 , after his summer move from @entity170			1
the city manager defended his rotation policy , claiming he has his players ' best interest in mind rather than sheer ruthlessness			2
action : @entity0 begin their title defence this weekend when they travel to @entity6 ' the best way to have high performance is to have two competitive players in each position , ' said @entity8			1
' nobody must be afraid of that : @entity130 had a very good second part of the season last year			0
' he 's the best goalkeeper in @entity163 , but of course when he did n't play well last year we played ( @entity190 ) @entity189			2
' it 's impossible for a player to play 60 games in a year , to play 18 games during december and january as we did last season			0
' it is sure that that player would be injured if that happened , so that 's why it 's so important to have two quality players in each position			0
' i always decide the best team for each game , this week the same , and on monday we will review @entity6 and start that process again			2
