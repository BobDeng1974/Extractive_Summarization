by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 29 january 2013 health experts are calling for a 7p - a - can ‘ fat tax ’ on sugary soft drinks to tackle the rising menace of childhood obesity			1
a powerful alliance of 61 organisations , including the country ’s most eminent doctors and the @entity10 , wants the move to be announced in the spring budget			1
the experts argue that the 20p - a - litre levy on bottles and cans of fizzy drinks could help cut consumption in the same way that tax is used to deter smoking and drinking			1
crackdown : experts claim adding 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of fizzy drink will cut consumption and help tackle childhood obesity the move , which would add nearly 7p to the price of a regular 330ml can of @entity31 or @entity32 , would raise £ 1billion a year to promote healthier eating			1
the alliance has been brought together by @entity35 , the campaigning food and health group			1
the prime minister has indicated some sympathy for the idea in the past			0
sustain campaigns director @entity42 said : ‘ sugar - laden drinks are mini health timebombs , contributing to dental diseases , obesity and a host of life - threatening illnesses which cost the @entity49 billions each year			0
’ most of the money raised through the levy would be ring - fenced for a children ’s @entity53 , which would be spent on improving children ’s health by , for example , providing free school meals or free fruit and vegetable snacks			2
epidemic proportions : one child in three is already obese or overweight before they leave primary school an independent body would be given responsibility to oversee how the drinks duty , which would apply to products with added sugar , is implemented and spent			1
the initiative has the support of the @entity72 , which effectively speaks for the entire medical profession			0
dr @entity74 , of the @entity75 at @entity76 , said : ‘ just as we use fiscal measures to discourage drinking and smoking and help prevent people from dying early , there is now lots of evidence that the same approach would work for food			0
‘ this modest proposal goes some way towards making the price of food reflect its true costs to society			0
' our obesity epidemic causes debilitating illness , life - threatening diseases and misery for millions of people			0
it is high time government did something effective			0
’ @entity99 is the fattest country in @entity100 , with one in four adults classed as obese while one child in three is already obese or overweight before they leave primary school			1
dealing with diet - related illnesses , such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease , costs the @entity49 £ 6billion a year , predicted to soar to £ 50billion by 2050			0
countries such as @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , and in some states in the @entity111 already impose a tax on unhealthy foods			2
@entity108 brought in a duty of 6p a litre on all drinks with added sugar or artificial sweeteners a year ago			0
the tax rises to 40p a litre on energy drinks			2
@entity121 , director general of the @entity99 @entity122 , said a fat tax on fizzy drinks would not reduce obesity			1
‘ obesity is a serious and complex problem , but a tax on soft drinks , which contribute just two per cent of the total calories in the average diet , will not help address it , ’ he said			2
‘ over the past ten years , the consumption of soft drinks containing added sugar has fallen by nine per cent while the incidence of obesity has increased by 15 per cent			2

*shocking* figures show @entity99 is the fattest country in @entity100
one child in three is obese or overweight before they leave primary school
