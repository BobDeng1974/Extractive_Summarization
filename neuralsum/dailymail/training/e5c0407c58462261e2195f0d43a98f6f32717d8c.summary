it is quite a way to start your day			1
astronaut @entity2 today tweeted this incredible image of his view when he woke up - the sun rising over the curvature of the @entity7			1
' tough to beat a good sunrise – on @entity7 or in low earth orbit , ' he told his 262,000 followers			1
the station crew sees , on average , sixteen sunrises and sunsets during a 24 - hour orbital period			2
each changeover between day and night on the ground is marked by the terminator , or line separating the sunlit side of @entity7 from the side in darkness			2
while the terminator is conceptualized as a hard boundary -- and is frequently presented as such in graphics and visualizations -- in reality the boundary between light and dark is diffuse due to scattering of light by @entity7 ’s atmosphere			0
this zone of diffuse lighting is experienced as dusk or twilight on the ground -- while the sun is no longer visible , some illumination is still present due to light scattering over the local horizon			0

in a trend pioneered by @entity66 @entity65 commander @entity64 , new recruits are now tweeting regularly from orbit			1
astronaut @entity2 , who is currently aboard the station , is a prolific snapper , along with his @entity71 colleague @entity70			1
earlier this week @entity2 tweeted this image , saying ' good morning from # space ' ' my favorite views from # space – just past # sunrise over the ocean ' @entity2 tweeted along with this snap on 2nd september			1
the pair have even developed their own styles , with @entity70 preferring abstract patterns on the @entity7 's surface , while @entity2 favours storms and cities			1
recently @entity70 took part in a live @entity89 to answer questions from people on @entity7			0
one included sir @entity92 , who asked : ' what do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years ' time ? pioneers ? guides ? or the norm ? ' @entity70 responded : ' my hope would be that in 50 years from now , space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts , but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience i am having right now			0
' anyway , i hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away			0
' on saturday , june 11 , 2011 , @entity65 astronaut @entity112 used a high definition camera to film one of the sixteen sunrises astronauts see each day			1
this image shows the rising sun as the station flew along a path between @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity124 .			0

astronauts aboard the @entity65 see 16 sunrises a day
