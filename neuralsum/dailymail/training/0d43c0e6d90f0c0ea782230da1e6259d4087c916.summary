she said : ' the last thing i remember is the taxi turning across @entity82 as i was on the phone to a friend			0
' the next thing , i woke up with people all around me			0
i had something in my mouth so i could n’t speak but i realised my belly had gone smaller and my baby was gone			0
' because i could n’t talk i kept just touching my belly and heard people saying " your baby is fine "			0
' i found out later the doctors had told my boyfriend to be prepared because they had n’t seen that many people survive things like this before			2
injuries : @entity4 suffered a severed artery above her heart , fractured ribs which pierced her liver , a fractured cheekbone , broken foot and shattered pelvis , in the smash but , incredibly , both her and her baby survived ' i think at one point he was asked if he would rather save me or the baby			1
my heart had stopped beating for a few seconds and they thought i was dead			2
' a few days later i woke up again and @entity5 was there in a wheelchair			2
that was when i got to hold @entity20 for the first time			0
' i still ca n’t work out how i survived			0
i just feel so lucky to be alive and that @entity20 is okay			0
' on the mend : @entity4 still needs a wheelchair to get around because of the injuries to her pelvis and she is also still suffering from memory loss @entity4 also suffered a fractured cheekbone , broken foot and a huge cut across her head , which needed 48 stitches			1
she is now back at her @entity15 home and is recovering well , but remains in a wheelchair and has memory problems			0
@entity5 was also injured in the crash on may 3 , needing surgery for a punctured lung , broken ribs and injuries to his feet			1
he said : ' i did n’t know what to do when they said i might have to choose between @entity4 and the baby , i was in so much pain			2
' i just did n’t want to go to the operating theatre myself until i heard the baby had been born - when i heard him cry i started crying too			0
i am devastated i missed him being born but so happy he and @entity4 are alive			2
' intensive care registrar dr @entity150 was part of a team of doctors fighting to save both @entity4 and her son			1
dr @entity150 said : ' their survival is entirely testament to the fact that we have had a really good major trauma system set up			0
' in @entity4 ’s case we checked her baby and found its heart rate was dropping , and found a major blood vessel coming from her heart had been cut in two			1
her and her baby ’s lives really were in serious danger			0
' but after surgery , within a few days she was ready to be awakened			2
her mother had come over from @entity175 and i took her off the ventilator and introduced them , then about an hour later we brought her baby in so she could see him for the first time			0
' the driver of the @entity12 , a 19 - year - old man , was arrested by police at the scene of the crash on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and other driving offences			0
