mr @entity7 continued to use the camera until his death in 1995 , including for a photo shoot with president @entity54			1
the only defect on the camera , which was a successor to the groundbreaking @entity58 , is a small dent on the underside of the camera , which resulted from the photographer dropping it which carrying out an assignment			2
the photograph of the kiss , a 17.5x12in print bearing mr @entity7 's signature on the back , also exceeded its estimate when it went under the hammer			1

however , the historic camera was not the most expensive sold at the auction on saturday			1

the company made a ' @entity87 ' model for the @entity3 air force but at the same time as supplying the @entity37 , staff at the company helped @entity103 employees flee the country			1
the @entity9 series helped pave the way for the small hand - held cameras which became commonplace in the 20th century			0
it was one of the earliest ' rangefinder ' cameras , which allowed photographers to measure the distance between them and their subjects in order to make sure their pictures were in sharp focus			0
the @entity30 was first made in 1935 , and represented an advance on its predecessors by allowing photographers to use a shutter speed of just 1/1000 seconds			2
the model used by mr @entity7 is mounted with a @entity85 2/5cm lens and @entity90 viewfinder mr @entity7 bought the camera when he was living in @entity3 , before emigrating to the @entity125 at the age of 26 in 1935 as the @entity96 government became increasingly oppressive towards the @entity103			1
before his departure , he photographed senior @entity37 including @entity129 , whom he snapped during a meeting with @entity131 , and @entity132 , who is scowling in his photograph - apparently because he had just discovered that mr @entity7 was @entity103			1

it sold for almost $ 31,000 at auction @entity170 , the sailor from the photograph , with his wife @entity172 last year the first @entity9 prototype was built by the company @entity174 in @entity175 in 1913 , but it was not until 1925 that the firm produced its first commercially available camera			2
the small , portable cameras became quickly popular , and established @entity9 's reputation as one of the world 's leading photography companies , which it remains today			0
like many @entity3 firms , @entity174 co-operated closely with the @entity96 government in the 1930s and 1940s - @entity132 encourage citizens to use its cameras to produced idealised depictions of the aryan race			2
however , behind the scenes the company was working to save its many @entity103 employees by helping them leave @entity3			1
@entity174 set up what would become known as the ' @entity195 ' , sending workers to its offices overseas to allow them to escape the racist @entity200 laws within @entity3 and start a new life in @entity202 , @entity203 or the @entity125 @entity174 never talked about his heroic deeds , which were brought to an end by the onset of war in 1939 , but @entity103 groups have recently paid tribute to his altruistic attitude			1
the identity of the two people in the photograph is not entirely clear , but they are widely believed to be @entity170 and @entity214			0
in 1979 , @entity215 wrote to mr @entity7 claiming she was the woman who was kissed , but experts later claimed she was too short to be the person depicted			0
however , when @entity222 asked the subjects of the photograph to step forward , a total of three women and 11 men claimed to be the kissers			0
an examination of the sailor 's scars and tattoos soon suggested that mr @entity170 was the man , and he identified ms @entity214 - who was a dental hygienist - as the woman			0
the sailor was at the cinema with a date when news came of the @entity14 surrender , and he says he kissed the woman because he considered her uniform showed she was part of the war effort			0
mr @entity170 's date , @entity172 , would later become his wife - she has since said she did not mind the passionate embrace , which took place right in front of her , but added : ' in all these years , @entity146 has never kissed me like that			0
' ms @entity214 played down the significance of the kiss in later years , saying : ' it was n't that much of a kiss			0
it was more of a jubilant act that he did n't have to go back [ to fight in the @entity253 ]			0
' she also paid tribute to the upbeat atmosphere in @entity26 on @entity50 : ' all throughout the day and the evening , people were there			0
it was like @entity260 , only better ! ' and she had no idea she was being photographed when the stranger grabbed her - she was just anxious to get back to her job at the dentist 's			0
