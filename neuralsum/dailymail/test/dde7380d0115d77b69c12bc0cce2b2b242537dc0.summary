' aides to the minister stressed that job satisfaction and work - life balance for those on zero - hours contracts were similar to other workers			1

' labour leader @entity64 today launched his party 's manifesto for young people in @entity68 @entity4 has pledged to ban exploitative zero - hours contracts , while unions have been pressing for them to be scrapped altogether			1
under the controversial contracts , workers are often told at the end of the week how many hours they can work the following week			0
launching @entity4 's manifesto for young people in @entity68 , party leader @entity64 said : ' young people are three times more likely to be on zero - hours contracts than the rest of the population			1
' @entity0 has tried today to rename zero - hours contracts as ' flexible contracts '			2
we do n't need to rename zero - hours contracts , we need to ban exploitative zero - hours contracts , and that 's what the next @entity4 government will do			1
' @entity87 , leader of the @entity89 union , said zero - hours contracts meant ' misery ' or workers and their families , leaving them on a ' hand to mouth ' existence			1
' this insecurity has exploded on @entity97 's watch , where we have an economy built on shaky jobs and chronic low pay			0
' @entity102 general secretary @entity101 said : ' whatever you call a zero - hours contract , it is still a recipe for insecurity and exploitation , where the boss holds all the power			2
' nothing sums up what is wrong with this government 's approach to work and how out of touch they are with the way most people live their lives than this celebration of the zero - hours contract			1
' if you put lipstick on a pig , it is still a pig			0

' shadow business secretary @entity46 accused the @entity8 of being out of touch @entity0 's ' @entity6 ' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the @entity8 are about the lives of working people			0

the @entity8 have a history of @entity154 moments			0
today 's comment comes from the minister who renamed the @entity157 the ' removal of the spare room subsidy ' and the party which insisted on calling the poll tax the ' community charge '			0
and three weeks ago @entity97 said that more people are using food banks because of better advertising – next he 'll be rebadging them as @entity167 supermarkets			0
this reveals an important truth about the @entity8 – they simply wo n't stand up for working people			0
just a few weeks ago @entity97 admitted he could n't live on a zero - hours contract			2
but the @entity8 seem happy for working people to be stuck in low - paid zero - hour contract jobs			0
it 's becoming increasingly clear throughout this campaign that they will only stand up for a privileged few			0
the reality – that the @entity8 refused to acknowledge – is that for too many people zero - hours contracts leave them without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will get			1
the number of people with zero - hour contracts has increased by almost 20 per cent in the last year and surveys show that over half of young people on these contracts are on them because they could not find a job with regular hours			0
companies such as @entity190 are hiring the vast majority of their workers on zero - hours contracts , even though they have predictable and manageable fluctuations in demand and many of these employees reportedly work regular hours in practice			1
this is insecurity dressed up as flexibility			0
it 's not acceptable , it 's not fair and @entity4 will act to stop it			0
@entity4 will ban exploitative zero - hours contracts			1
with @entity4 , if you work regular hours for 12 weeks or more you will get a right to a regular contract			0
we will also give workers on zero - hours contracts new rights to be protected from employers forcing them to be available at all hours or cancelling shifts at short notice without compensation			1
@entity4 is clear : we do n't need to rename exploitative zero - hours contracts			1
we need to ban them			0
