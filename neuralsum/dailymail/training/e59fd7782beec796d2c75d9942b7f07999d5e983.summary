by @entity0 a @entity2 actor has relived the day his three - year - old son came to the brink of death - after eating just one cashew nut			1
@entity7 was on a family holiday on the @entity10 island of @entity11 when a severe allergic reaction gripped his son @entity13 , covering his skin in hives and closing up his throat			1
by sheer chance a neighbouring holidaymaker had an adrenaline shot , a miracle which the 41 - year - old and his wife @entity21 are convinced saved their son 's life			1
by sheer chance a neighbour had an adrenaline shot danger : the three - year - old spent five days on a hospital ward in @entity11 ( right ) recovering from the reaction they drove @entity13 at breakneck speeds to a @entity10 hospital , where he spent five days recovering			1
at first his eyes were so swollen that he could not see , his father said , and his condition was so distressing that it prompted two junior nurses to burst into tears			0
nine years later , he is a happy - go - lucky secondary school pupil and a chorister at @entity46 's @entity45 - but still carries a rucksack with adrenaline shots everywhere he goes			1
mr @entity7 , whose film credits include @entity50 and @entity51 : voyage to the @entity53 , spoke out about the incident as a warning to other parents to have their children allergy tested			1
the actor , who lives with @entity63 employee @entity21 , their son @entity13 and @entity13 's six - year - old brother @entity60 in @entity61 , south east @entity46 , said the horror of the incident changed their lives			1
he became a prominent member of the @entity70 charity and raises awareness of allergic reactions , which the charity says kill 20 people a year			2
family trauma : mr @entity7 did not take photos of his son when he was first brought to hospital , but was able to play with him again as the family realised he was going to survive the reaction			1
pictured : the pair in hospital @entity83 : @entity13 after he was released from hospital , with his face still visibly swollen from the effects of the nut the charity recorded a heart - warming film of mr @entity7 recalling the incident on the unluckiest day of his life - friday 13 may , 2005			1
mr @entity7 said his son had eaten peanuts and other snacks all his life , but never a cashew nut			1
just 15 seconds after tasting one in their holiday villa , he ' came running into the room with a look of panic on his face ' , the actor said			2
recovered : @entity13 ( second from left with his parents and brother @entity60 ) is now 12 ' then he vomited uncontrollably on the floor , and he looked at me with a strange pleading look , ' he said			1
' i knew something was wrong , very wrong			0
instinctively i turned to @entity21 and said , " he 's allergic to nuts "			1
' i would like to say that my wife and i were the personification of calm			0
i 've played doctors on screen and stage , i 've watched endless doctors ' procedures on television , but all i could come up with was : " get some help "			0
' his skin covered in hives , @entity13 arrived with his parents at an emergency room on the @entity10 island which mr @entity7 said was full of ' @entity126 people with sunburn ' , and waited half an hour to see a doctor			1
by the time they were with the doctor , @entity13 was having a second reaction - but could not be treated at the clinic			1
his parents were told to take him to the island 's main hospital in a fellow holidaymaker 's car			2
' @entity13 took a turn for the worse , ' said mr @entity7			1
' he began panicking , he could n't stop convulsing			0
' our friend turned into a formula 1 driver - i do n't think he stopped for a single red light			1
he got us to the hospital in 15 minutes , not 30 , which i think is still a @entity147 island record			0
' we would later learn that this hospital was not equipped for the kind of emergency we had presented them with			0
from behind the double doors of doom i could hear my son screaming , yelling , pleading			2
' i went into the emergency room and @entity13 already had four needles in him			1
he was distraught , surrounded by people in white coats and every passing minute brought another doctor running through the doors			0
' of course the medical attendees never spoke @entity126			0
then two junior nurses looked at each other and started crying			0
i was n't feeling very confident			0
a lesson for all parents : @entity13 is now 12 years old and is a chorister at @entity45 in south @entity46 family : mr and mrs @entity169 said they learned a lot from the experience and now campaign on the issue ' then i left my body - genuinely and seriously - and i knew in an instant why people have out - of - body experiences , because their heart , mind and soul can not take what is presented to them			1
' i floated in the corner of that emergency room watching myself watch my son die			2
anaphylaxis is triggered when a sensitised individual comes in to contact with one of a huge range of allergens			2
these can include nuts , milk , eggs , bee and wasp venom , kiwi fruit , latex rubber and even exercise			2
a reaction can cause a drop in blood pressure , and swelling in the face , mouth and throat leading to a narrowing of the airways , difficulty breathing , collapse and even death			0
parents can have their children tested for most common allergies free on the @entity214 , via a gp			0
the skin prick test involves injecting a trace of the allergen into the skin and monitoring whether it causes a reaction			0
the @entity70 , which recorded mr @entity7 's story , offers advice to parents , schools and caterers to reduce the risk of fatal incidents			1
chief executive @entity229 said : ' @entity7 and @entity13 ’s story is very moving and could easily have ended in tragedy			1
' unfortunately , however , it is the sort of story we hear on a weekly basis at the @entity70			0
deaths from anaphylaxis do occur , in fact , there are on average 20 deaths every year			2
' for more advice visit anaphylaxis.org.uk			0
' @entity13 stared at me and said one word : " @entity245 "			1
i could n't tell whether it was a question , a statement , a plea , an affirmation or an acceptance			0
i answered : " i love you "			0
' the doctors managed to save @entity13 , who spent five days in hospital			1
he is now 12 years old and attends a secondary school near his @entity46 home , where he is even permitted to have school dinners			2
others are not as lucky as @entity13			2
this week an inquest heard how a teenager with a nut allergy died after eating ribs from a @entity263 takeaway			2
@entity264 , 15 , was unaware that the barbecue sauce he ordered near his home on the @entity267 was prepared with peanut butter			0
after a few bites he began struggling to breathe , the @entity269 heard			0
@entity264 was taken to hospital by ambulance but died shortly after			2
his father @entity273 , 45 , told the court how he ' cradled ' his son as he lay dying			0
speaking of the tragic case , mr @entity7 said : ' it 's horrible and it just makes me think how easily it could happen to us , to anyone			1
it 's heartbreaking for the family and my heart goes out to them			0
' in mr @entity7 's case , there was more than a hint of the supernatural about events of that day nine years ago			1
all day they had searched in vain for a traditional figurine of the @entity295 to take home as a souvenir for his father			0
and when mr @entity7 asked the mystery saviour with an adrenaline pen for her name , she turned to him and said simply : ' it 's @entity295 '			1
at the end of a harrowing day , he phoned his father			0
' @entity245 , ' he said			0
' i think i found your @entity295 ' .			0

@entity7 , from @entity46 , was in @entity50 and @entity51
his son @entity13 almost died after eating nuts on holiday in @entity11 , @entity10
by sheer fluke a neighbour had an adrenaline pen - saving @entity13 's life
experience turned into a short film to raise awareness of anaphylaxis
