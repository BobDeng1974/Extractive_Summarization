a 28 - year - old medical school student who had planned to auctioning off her virginity on the internet and had received a high bid of $ 801,000 now says she wo n't go ahead with her part of the bargain			2
in a blog post today , the student , who goes buy the name ' @entity8 , ' writes that she wo n't fulfill the terms of the auction as she wants to focus on her medical studies instead			1
' with the blessings of my management and the high bidders , i have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle ( to describe it nicely ) and return my focus to my medical training , ' @entity8 wrote , according to @entity21			1
' i still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity , prostitution , and a woman 's right to do as she damned pleases , but school is my first priority ( as it has been for my entire life )			0
auction : @entity32 offered up her virginity on a website , where she used the name @entity8 ' at this point , i no longer care about the auction , at all			1
this was a very easy decision			0
' while @entity8 initially said she was selling her virginity for the money , in recent days , her tone had changed and become more political			1
' it is no longer about the money , ' she wrote recently			2
' instead , very broadly , it is about how society continues to exercise control over female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality			1
' it is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past ( we all know male morality is not judged by the same standard ) , and that a woman still can not chose to do with her body what she pleases without eliciting condemnation and hate from those ( or some of those ) around her			0
' @entity8 launched her online auction on march 31 and initially hid her face to conceal her identity before later deciding it would help convince skeptical customers			1
initially , she said she wanted to do the auction as she is also attracted by the adventure , eroticism , scandal and the chance to challenge norms about virginity			1
at the time , she added that she 's been planning the auction for a year and it 's transformed her , making her more educated about prostitution , virginity and ' slut - shaming			2
' @entity8 told the @entity82 she was born in the southwest but spent much of her childhood in @entity85 because of her dad 's job in the oil industry			2
he mom died when she was 10 , which was tragic but the trauma is not the reason she is choosing this path to riches			0
she told news website that she 's still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments			0
cold feet : @entity32 pulled out of her online auction on wednesday , saying she wanted to focus on her studies ' i have a busy life			1
i am picky and guys were never a priority , ' she said			0
@entity8 claims to have bachelor 's degrees in both biology and engineering and is currently completing a combined md / phd program , but was concerned her ' business venture ' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she 's the ' @entity114			0
' ' lawyers have different opinions on whether i 'd get kicked out , but one lawyer i trust believes it wo n't happen , ' she said			0
if she had gone through with the deal , the sex would have taken place in @entity122 because prostitution is illegal in the @entity124 auction : despite attracting a bid of $ 801,000 , a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials			0
