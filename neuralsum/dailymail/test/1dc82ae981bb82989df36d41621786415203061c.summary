@entity0 fears @entity1 is ' running out of time ' to resurrect his @entity4 career			1
@entity0 , speaking at the @entity7 's @entity6 launch , sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for ' probably the premier tournament ' in this country			1
the dual @entity13 - winning all - rounder is less convinced , however , about @entity1 's prospects of forcing his way back into test contention			1
@entity1 scored 170 for @entity17 in @entity18 as he bids to earn a recall to the @entity4 squad former @entity4 star @entity0 thiks time is running out for @entity1 to resurrect his @entity4 career @entity1 already has three @entity13 series wins on his cv but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins , and @entity0 senses he no longer has age on his side			1
the controversial record - breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after @entity31 's team were whitewashed 5 - 0 in @entity32 , but has taken heart from incoming @entity7 chairman @entity35 ' hints that there may be a way back after all			1
@entity1 and his agent have both spoken of the ' clean slate ' being presented to him , and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against @entity41 in his first red - ball innings for @entity17 since june 2013			1
@entity0 is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for @entity1			1
' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the @entity4 team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' @entity0 told @entity49			1
@entity4 have won their last three tests under @entity31 , pre-dating a miserable @entity51 , and took a three - figure first - innings lead in the first match of three in the @entity54			1
@entity1 has not featured for @entity4 since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form			1
' which of them do you say " you 're not playing ! " for @entity1 to come in ? ' @entity0 said			1
' i just think @entity1 is running out of time a little bit			1
' if he 'd started the season last year with @entity17 , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the @entity13 and he 's just running out of time			1
' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future			2
' @entity0 is optimistic about @entity4 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without @entity1			1
' @entity31 is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the @entity4 set - up wants him as captain , ' he said			2
' he 's a popular lad , and a great player			2
' @entity82 , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke			0
' the former @entity4 star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket @entity4 , @entity0 believes , just need a little more support			1
' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added			0
' in @entity32 , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants @entity32 to do well			0
' with @entity4 , i 've never had a sense of that			2
' it 's about time we started talking them up			2
i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind @entity31 , @entity82 , the players			2
' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet			0
( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit			0
' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's @entity119 , insisting it is no poor relation of the @entity121 - or the @entity122 , in which he played last winter for @entity124			0
@entity0 says @entity31 is so important to @entity4 despite poor showing in the first test against @entity54 @entity0 said : ' the competition gets stronger			1
it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it			0
' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , @entity136 , @entity137 , ( @entity138 ) @entity139 , ( @entity141 ) @entity140			0
' i played in the @entity122 , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition			0
' you turn up at @entity147 for @entity148 , and get 25,000 people , then to @entity150 where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that			0
' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there			0
' we do n't really focus on what we 've got			0
@entity0 shares a joke with players at the @entity119 launch at @entity163 on thursday ' i did n't see anything within the @entity122 and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home '			2
' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping @entity148 to win the tournament last summer , is another matter			0
' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the @entity148 dressing - room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added			0
' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that '			2
' i do n't see failing as a problem			0
but i see not having a go as a crime			0
' so i thought " i 'm going to have a go " , and i certainly loved it			0
