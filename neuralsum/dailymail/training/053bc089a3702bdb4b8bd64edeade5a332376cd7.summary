boy , that was close			2
@entity2 looked like we might beat @entity4 for this first time in our history but , in the end , we were just not quite good enough			1
the @entity4 were there for the taking and we might never get a better chance to beat them			1
over the last number of years , i ’ve had to draw the positives out of defeat after defeat and sometimes it ’s been tough to do			0
there were so many positives , the main one being that @entity2 are a credible team on the international stage again			1
granted , this was not the @entity4 first team but has there ever been a poor @entity4 or a poor @entity4 side ? these players might not be first choice in @entity4 but they would be in many other countries			1
so to match them in many parts of the game , to completely dominate them at line - out time and to be in touching distance right at the end was hugely encouraging			2
@entity2 pushed @entity4 all the way before suffering a narrow defeat at @entity39 on saturday i would have loved @entity41 to have kicked over that penalty which would have given us the lead with eight minutes to go			1
i would have loved to see how @entity2 would have reacted to taking the lead and how @entity4 would have reacted to going behind			1
we probably know the answer to that one as they have been in that situation many times before and , more often than not , have found a way to win the game			0
what we do n’t know is how @entity2 would have coped with the pressure of trying to close out a game against a team they have never beaten before			1
but to be contemplating such a scenario proves how far this young team have come in these last two games			0
they put everything into the game and just came up short - but what a learning experience it was for so many players			2
he went toe - to - toe with the great @entity67 and more than matched him throughout the game			2
his effort and engine were phenomenal and he should take huge confidence from mixing it with that company and playing so well			0
@entity74 was another who was up against one of the best stand - offs of all time in @entity76			2
this time last year @entity74 was playing for @entity78 and there he was , one year on , smashing @entity76 back in the tackle and running the game for @entity2			1
he has , without a doubt , a big future and could be our stand - off for many years to come			2
@entity85 ( centre ) and @entity87 both scored tries in a 24 - 16 win for @entity4 i was really impressed with @entity2 ’s desire to play and to take the game to @entity4			1
they were prepared to try things even when deep in their own 22 and asked huge questions of the visiting defence			0
when it stood firm , @entity2 were still able to recycle the ball and try again which proves how good they were in contact			1
in the past , we would have conceded a penalty or a try from turnover ball			0
this team plays with real ambition but also has the accuracy and quality to back it up			0
it was a great experience being at @entity39 on saturday night			1
for years , the pre-match entertainment there has been the best of any venue i ’ve been to but then the team ’s performance has n’t matched it			0
the light show was amazing and created a wonderful spectacle and arena for the game to follow and , at last , we now have a team who can live up to the hype			0
they have real quality and real character			0
i liked how they reacted to conceding an early try			0
it came from a bad missed tackle by @entity130 but he shrugged it off and put in a huge performance			0
they did not stand off @entity4 and pressured them into making mistakes , like when @entity137 intercepted @entity67 ’s pass for our try			1
it was a brilliant example of reading the situation and making the right decision and it brought us right back in the game			0
considering the average margin of defeat in the last four games against the @entity4 has been 35 points , a defeat by only eight suggests real progress			1
@entity2 are definitely moving in the right direction			2
@entity153 has made a big difference , and the future looks bright .			0
