when you 're a size 30 , finding a beautiful wedding dress is n't always easy			1
but now two best friends from @entity4 have come to the rescue with a bridal boutique that only stocks plus size gowns			1
at @entity10 , sizes range from a size 20 to a size 36 - and bigger brides from all over the @entity14 are flocking to @entity15 and @entity17 's door			1
' why should you endure the humiliation of having a dress hung around your neck or pinned against your body or being paraded around in front of a group of size 10 skinnies in a dress that quite obviously does n't fit you ? ' says @entity15			1
' i think until recently , that 's been the only option			2
' now there are all these beautiful gowns and i feel like i want to try them on when they come in , ' says law , sadly			1
' because i could n't have that and it was quite upsetting at the time			2
if i could do it [ getting married ] again , i would			2
and i will one day			2
' for the customers , @entity37 and @entity15 's shop is a haven or , as @entity15 pithily puts it , ' a little slice of plus size heaven '			1
one such client is @entity58 , a 29 - year - old from @entity4 who turned to @entity10 and @entity60 ahead of her wedding to now - husband , @entity62			1
pretty and with long blonde hair , she says her experience of searching for dresses in ' normal - sized ' bridal boutiques left her so traumatised , the search had to go on hold for eight months			1
overjoyed : 29 - year - old @entity70 from @entity4 is one of the plus size brides to wed in @entity10 and @entity60 ' it 's such a big thing putting on your dress , ' she says			1
' if the venue burnt down , i would n't care but if my dress was n't right , i would n't get married			2
' i did n't really want to go wedding dress shopping , ' she continues			2
' i went to one place and had a panic attack in the dress			2
' i was like : " get me out of here , get me out of here , get me out of here "			2
i had such a bad reaction to the way they made me feel in the shop , i did n't try on any dresses for about eight months			1
' everybody deserves the chance to feel special on their day , whether they 're black , white , yellow , green , pink with polka dots , ' adds law , furiously			1
' we do n't care			2
' the only thing we specify is that you 've got to be fat , ' adds @entity15			1
' it 's no good coming here if you 're size 12 because we 've got nothing for you			1
' but what really tugs at her heart - strings is the reaction of the brides themselves			1
' it 's not unusual for someone to walk through those doors and cry , ' she reveals			2
' once we say we 've got this dress in a size 20 to a 36 , they can be quite overwhelmed that there is somewhere where you can try on those dresses			1
' we were those girls , we were there , ' she continues			0
' we 've been there , we 've done it			0
@entity17 had to wear a bridesmaid 's dress			1
' nerves : @entity128 , 28 , from @entity129 said just trying on dresses made her nervous at first now the pair are to star in a documentary , @entity132 , which follows three brides , among them @entity58 and @entity15 herself , in the run up to their weddings			1
but while @entity58 and @entity15 are confident in their stunning wedding gowns , for the final bride , @entity128 , 28 , from @entity129 , just the thought of putting on a wedding dress is hard to stomach			1
' when i first turned up [ at the shop ] , i was really anxious and concerned , ' she admits			1
' i was quiet and sort of ... not uncomfortable but panicking about it			0
' i suppose for me it 's the dress because i do n't wear dresses			1
but by the end of it , i was loving it and i wanted to try on every dress			0
and then i found my dress			0
' for @entity153 , the issue was compounded by the loss of her sister @entity155 who died in a car accident a decade ago			0
' in 2003 , my sister was killed in a car accident which devastated the family and for a while we did n't know what to do with ourselves , ' she says , sadly			0
' then i found @entity165 and started my new life with him , even though it was still very hard			0
but then i had my daughter and i saw my parents smile and it brought new light			0
' with the wedding , it 's extra emotional because i personally would have gone abroad to get married because i hate the whole being centre of attention thing			0
it 's just not me			0
' but after losing my sister , i think my dad has the right to walk me down the aisle			0
we were joined at the hip and i allowed my sister to do all the talking for me			0
thrilled : @entity15 says she felt like a bride for the first time when she renewed her vows with husband @entity186 ' now she 's not here , i have the responsibility to do that for him and i 'm going to make sure that happens			1
' such is @entity153 's lack of confidence , even fittings proved a challenge although she says the confidence classes run by @entity15 and @entity37 helped a lot			1
' the master class that they provide is really good and the fact that they offer it to brides and help with their confidence			1
she adds : ' i 've always been a bigger sort of girl but i put a lot of weight on after my sister [ died ]			0
@entity165 loves me for who i am and so do my parents			0
' my mum has tried to get me to lose weight but that 's not for my looks , it 's because she 's concerned for my health			0
my wedding will be a happy day but there 's a lot of heartache with it			0
' one bride who has no such qualms is @entity15 , who is renewing her vows with @entity186 , her husband of 15 years , in a dress from @entity10 and @entity60			1
' i want to look a million dollars , ' she says			0
' i 'm never going to be a skinny girl but i want to look good and like i 'm rocking that dress			0
and i want @entity230 to go , that will be my wife			0
' but even @entity15 , who has lost four stone over the last 12 months thanks to a tough new gym routine , admits to feeling nervous when it comes to looking at herself in her bridal finery			1
' i do n't look in the mirror if i can help it			0
i do n't look because i do n't like what i see			0
i do n't want to be skinny			0
all i 've ever wanted to do is be accepted			0
' my mentality is a fat girl 's mentality because i 've been a fat girl for over 45 years and i will always feel like a fat girl in a skinny girl 's body			1
' she adds : ' my first wedding dress was a size 26 and it was all there was			2
@entity230 has told me every day for the last 15 years that i look beautiful			2
' the only day he did n't tell me was on our wedding day and that 's stuck with me			0
so if he does n't do it this time , there will be no vows			0
' this will be the fourth time i walk down the aisle and the first time i feel like a bride , ' she smiles			2
' and i know @entity230 will love it .			0
