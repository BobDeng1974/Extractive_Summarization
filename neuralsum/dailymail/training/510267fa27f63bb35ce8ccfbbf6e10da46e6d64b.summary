reconnaissance photos captured by @entity2 - era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the @entity5 , revealing thousands of ancient cities , roads , canals , and other ruins			1
the archaeologists behind the new @entity11 of the @entity5 report that a survey of satellite images has revealed thousands of previously undiscovered sites in @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 – including long - lost cities that could be among the earliest in human history			1
‘ some of these sites are gigantic , and they were completely unknown , ’ said @entity21 archaeologist @entity20 at the launch of the atlas during the @entity25 ’s annual conference on thursday			0
reconnaissance photos captured by @entity2 - era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the @entity5 , for instance this 1961 satellite photo shows tell @entity30 in northwest @entity17 , which is now completely surrounded by a modern town ‘ we can see all kinds of things – ancient roads and canals			1
the images provide a very comprehensive picture			0
’ the images were taken by the first generation of @entity43 spy satellites - a system code - named corona - dating from 1960 - 1972			2
the photos were intended to expose @entity48 missile bases and military camps , reports @entity50			1
@entity54 images were acquired on large rolls of black - and - white film , and because no means of transmitting images remotely had yet been developed , canisters of film , once exposed , were ejected and parachuted to earth where they were intercepted in mid-air by a plane			0
the archive , consists of more than 860,000 satellite images covering much of the world , was declassified by president @entity66 in 1995			0
the 1960s image , left , captures an area of southern @entity15 's marshes , many of which have since been drained , while the photo on the right shows the same location in the early 2000s the @entity21 @entity75 for @entity76 ( @entity77 ) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of @entity54 imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database until recently the photos had limited use as the unique imaging geometry of the @entity54 satellite cameras , which produced long , narrow film strips , made correcting spatial distortions in the images a laborious task			0
the @entity91 ( @entity77 ) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of @entity54 imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database			0
the images of the @entity5 have proved to be an invaluable resource in the archaeology of the region because they pre-date the widespread construction of reservoirs , urban expansion , and agricultural intensification the area has undergone in recent decades			1
surveying land from @entity103 to @entity104 - and encompassing the @entity105 , the renowned cradle of civilization and location of some of humanity 's earliest cities – the spy - satellite images have revealed 10,000 sites that had previously been unknown			2
the largest sites , in @entity17 and @entity16 , are most likely @entity116 cities and include ruined walls and citadels			2
many of the @entity54 images cover other areas of great interest to archaeologists , including @entity124 and @entity125			0
signs of ancient habitation are visible in this satellite image of @entity129 in eastern @entity130 , which was declassified by president @entity66 in 1995 the photos were intended to expose @entity48 missile bases and military camps , a missile launch site near @entity137 in the @entity48 is outlined in this 1969 image			1
