the mastermind behind the @entity2 drug trafficking plot is allegedly currently enjoying an extravagant lifestyle in @entity4 , having literally won the lottery after he escaped all convictions			1
the unnamed man is living the high - life whilst two @entity10 men , @entity11 and @entity12 , face execution by firing squad this month			1
it 's alleged the ringleader won $ 5 million after the nine @entity10 were arrested in 2005 , according to @entity17			1
this comes as @entity20 's attorney - general said he plans to move this month 's executions forward , effectively ruling out the chance of of @entity11 and @entity12 's lawyers entering a fresh legal challenge against their death penalties			1
@entity10 @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , the mother of death - row prisoner @entity11 , and brother @entity29 ( r ) , leave after visiting @entity11 at @entity30 on february 10 in @entity31 , @entity32 @entity33 , the father of @entity11 , leaves after visiting @entity11 at @entity30 on february 10 the unnamed drug lord who masterminded the @entity2 plot had been the subject of previous police investigations into drug trafficking before the 2005 bust			1
however , he stepped away from his life of crime following his incredibly lucky lotto win , according to @entity17			2
@entity11 and @entity12 have never exposed the identity or the person or people they were working for , fearing they would put their families in @entity10 in danger			2
according to @entity51 , the mastermind behind the 2005 @entity10 to @entity20 drug run is suspected of having a high - level involvement in the syndicate			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were handed death penalties in 2006 and all subsequent appeals have failed			2
the @entity2 duo 's lawyers are planning a challenge of the presidential decree that denied them clemency in the @entity61			2
but @entity20 attorney - general @entity62 predicts the challenge will fail			1

the families have been visiting frequently following the government 's announcement that the two men on death row will be killed this month ' clemency is a prerogative which can not be hindered or challenged by anyone , ' he told reporters in @entity81 on tuesday			1
' that 's the prerogative right attached to the authority who has it			2
' the administrative court can not change that decision			0
' but the attorney - general also said it was also open to the president to reconsider clemency requests			1
the two men facing imminent death reportedly only had low - to - mid - level involvement			2
however , there are new reports that there is a possibility the execution of the two @entity10 will be further delayed			2

family members of @entity12 arrive for a visit at @entity30 jail			0
the two men on death row recently lost their final appeals for clemency despite arguing that they had rehabilitated themselves in prison the delay would occur due a conflict in @entity20 between corruption investigators and the national police force			1
however , attorney - general @entity117 contradicted @entity119 's claims , insisting that the executions would go ahead as planned			1

on the @entity129 @entity128 program she described his daily life as ' every day he is walking in the valley of death ' @entity64 , meantime , has on monday blamed the @entity134 for her son 's plight after they tipped off @entity20 authorities but those same officials insist they would do the same again and also into the future			1
' it 's a strange thing to wish to spend the rest of your life in prison			2
but we do n't want them to die , ' she said			0
the families of the @entity10 on death row have made a trip to @entity81 's presidential palace on to plead for the two @entity4 men to be spared			1

' this is what i am proud of			0
i feel that he is very down to earth - facing death every day , but not crying or making a scene			2
' therefore this time when i see him , although i am sad , i have inner peace			0
' her son @entity11 told @entity128 that he will continue to read and stay fit			0
' here i am , i sit here and i study			0

' i believe it 's not			2
i believe the @entity199 has a purpose for me			0
and it 's not here and it 's not to die			2
' @entity2 duo @entity12 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) could be executed by the end of the month @entity12 's mother @entity205 and his brother @entity206 along with @entity11 's mother @entity121 and his brother @entity29 will meet with @entity20 's national human rights organisation @entity209 to set forth the legal battle in a bid to save the condemned pair 's lives			1
' our days are very difficult , we ca n't stop thinking of what will happen and the violent way he will be killed			0
my mum keeps thinking about his and @entity11 's dead body being handed to her , she is having nightmares , ' @entity218 said			0
' why is it that the @entity20 president does not give him a chance and have pity on us being aged parents ? ' ms @entity26 told @entity128			2
' we are old and in poor health and we do not have long to live , therefore we would not like to see our son go before us			0
' it follows after the lawyer who represented the @entity2 ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the duo			1
australians on death row @entity11 and @entity12 are scheduled for execution this month			1
i did n't really think through the consequences or anything			0
somebody asked me to do something and i just sort of did it ' @entity12 said to @entity128 in an extraordinary twist , @entity247 says he has ' never revealed evidence ' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat ' for the @entity10 drug smugglers , @entity11 and @entity12 , who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month			1
' it 's something that implicates us , it could discredit me			0
but for them i will take it			0
i told @entity12 it 's okay , ' he said			0
' it 's one last thing i can do for them			0
' ' those judges , i believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death , they told me that was not want they wanted			0
' this highlights the problems that time , between the @entity20 government and the @entity10 government			1
' look , you know , i think every criminal , what rushes to their mind , they 're not gon na get busted , full stop , ' said @entity11 ' i see at that time , the judges were not independent in sentencing the case			0
' even though the families blame the @entity134 for the son 's fate , @entity282 , who led the @entity10 probe into the @entity2 , said : ' i think it 's a tragedy that we 've got young lives that are potentially facing the death penalty , but i believe it was a successful operation and , you know , taking eight kilograms of heroin , which is a very significant amount of heroin , off the streets is a significant operation			1
' @entity12 admitted on the @entity105 program : ' i was stupid			0
i did n't really think through the consequences or anything			0
somebody asked me to do something and i just sort of did it because they were my friends and i trusted them and i believed in them			0
' look , you know , i think every criminal , what rushes to their mind , they 're not gon na get busted , full stop , ' said @entity11			0
but a final clear warning from mr @entity282			0
' even with the aid of hindsight , should the same set of circumstances present themselves again with another syndicate or other people , we would exactly the same thing			0
