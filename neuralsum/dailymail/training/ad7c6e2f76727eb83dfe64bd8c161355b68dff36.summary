the winner of @entity2 's @entity1 has been crowned , but luckily for the owners their prize came in the form of a complete makeover for the unattractive space			1
what used to be a crowded , outdated and completely mismatched room in the house has been transformed into a bright and modern area perfect for entertaining or relaxing			1
@entity13 â€™s living space in their @entity16 , @entity15 , home is completely unrecognisable thanks to a $ 10,000 overhaul by online homewares retailer @entity20			1
before : @entity13 's living room was cluttered , outdated and in desperate need of a makeover after : the space is brighter , more modern and appears much more spacious originally it was her son @entity26 who entered @entity13 's house in the running , revealing his mother was too embarrassed to entertain even her own family in the living room			1
' my parents have struggled to pay off their mortgage for the past 16 years , leaving no money to fix up our home			0
' all my mother wants is to have an entertaining area to cater to her children and grandchildren without being embarrassed			0
she deserves this , ' @entity26 wrote in his touching entry			2
before the makeover @entity13 's living room featured bold green checkered couches , outdated wallpaper , cluttered corners and knick - knacks piled into every corner			1
before the makeover the room was crowded and full of green checkered couches now the space looks larger , and is filled with simpler furniture in an updated colour scheme @entity13 , pictured here with husband @entity60 , said she loves her new lounge room too much to pick just one piece that is her favourite there was a faded rug , ancient blinds on the windows , and pictures covering all the walls			1
now the room is full of vibrant colours , much more modern furniture and looks much more spacious than it previously did			2
speaking to @entity74 , @entity13 described the makeover as ' beautiful ' and expressed her gratitude for the helping hand renovating her home			1
' i just want to say thank you to everyone and i 'm really glad that my son entered us in the competition , ' she said			2
the winner also revealed how happy the new space makes her feel and the new living room provides a great starting point for renovating the rest of her home			0
the living space used to feature faded floral wallpaper over a pale pink paint job now the whole theme of the room is based around the powder blue colour on the walls stylist @entity98 said she designed the room to have a @entity101 feel about it when asked whether she had a favourite piece in the newly transformed space , @entity13 said it was too difficult to choose just one			1
' to tell you the truth i love it all together			0
' ' it makes me feel good , and thankful for him ( her son @entity26 ) ' , she revealed			1
@entity13 also revealed she looks forward to entertaining her family in the living room , but added there was a lot of them so it still might be a bit of a squeeze			2
@entity98 , stylist from @entity20 helped create the transformation , said the concept for the whole room began with the colour of the walls			2
' i made up a mood board and the first thing we decided was a paint colour and it all stemmed from there , ' ms @entity98 told @entity74			0
the @entity132 , pictured before the makeover , will now renovate the rest of their house around the new room next on their list to tackle is the kitchen , but @entity13 said the new living room gave them a great head start ' we wanted the wall to be not the average beige colour that people tend to go , ' she added , before saying she wanted to room to have a @entity101 feel to it			1
the owners moved all of the old furniture out and packed up their own possessions so nothing was lost , and in order to make room for the painters from @entity158			0
once that was completed it was simply ' a matter of assembling the furniture '			0
' the rug is one of my favourite pieces as well as the artwork above the smaller grey couch , ' ms @entity98 revealed			0
' and the floating shelf , the main idea behind doing that was so that we could display the family photos @entity13 had			0
' she had photos everywhere and we knew it was important to her to incorporate that into the room			0
