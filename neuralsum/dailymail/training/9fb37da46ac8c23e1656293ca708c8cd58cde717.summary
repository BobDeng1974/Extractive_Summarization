by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 13:32 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 20:48 est , 23 december 2013 the owner and the manager of a nursing home were criticised by a judge yesterday for their heartless neglect of elderly residents			0
@entity11 , 65 , was told he had put cost - cutting before welfare while @entity14 , 49 , was condemned as a liar and a bully			1
jailing them for 12 months , judge @entity17 highlighted fundamental failures of care at @entity22 nursing home in @entity23			1
neglect : @entity11 , 65 ( left ) , the owner of @entity22 care home in @entity27 , was found guilty of neglect along with manager and nurse @entity14 , 49 ( right ) , and the pair were sentenced to 12 months in jail problems included poor pressure sore management , insufficient toilet trips for at - risk residents , lack of cleaning materials and inadequate record keeping			1
@entity14 , who was described by the judge as ' a liar and a bully ' was found guilty of abusing the same patients , and another 68 - year - old @entity45 's sufferer who was hospitalised with a bedsore after only a week in the home			1
after that patient was taken away , @entity11 had tried to cover up the neglect by hiding the patient 's file , asking a nurse to lie on her report , and giving a dishonest statement himself			2
during the trial the court heard that in 2011 visiting nurses had found a patient lying in her own urine , that due to a lack of wipes patients were cleaned using their own underwear , and that one woman was left wearing the same incontinence pad for 13 hours			0
sentencing the pair at @entity67 , judge @entity17 said there were not enough cleaning materials at the home , records were poorly kept and that patients were not turned or taken to the toilet often enough			2
he also highlighted a lack of staff , saying that @entity14 's bullying manner drove employees away while @entity11 failed to recruit more in the mistaken belief that his head nurse could cope			1
he added that while @entity11 had bought the home in good faith in 1990 , by 2011 when the investigation started he seemed to have lost interest in			2
the victims included two @entity45 's patients , two people who could not move , and one 68 - year - old man who was hospitalised after only a week in the home ( file picture ) judge @entity90 said his actions were ' simply unforgivable ' and told him : ' you put the saving of money , perhaps your profit , over the welfare of elderly and vulnerable patients			1
' a home is not like stocks and shares			0
it can not be bought and used only as a means of collecting dividends and profits to be cashed in when the profit will be at its greatest			0
it is a gathering of humans			0
' today , @entity109 , from @entity110 and @entity111 , said : ' this was a very distressing case involving the wilful neglect of vulnerable , elderly residents at @entity22 care home in @entity23			1
' through not taking appropriate action , many residents developed pressure sores , or experienced rapid worsening of existing sores			0
' these were not treated properly , and the worst cases were not reported , as they should have been , for specialised external nursing treatment			0
' as a result these elderly people were left in conditions of unrelieved discomfort and some must have been suffering considerable pain			0
