@entity0 has risked the wrath of his manager @entity2 , after publicly stating his confusion at losing his place in the @entity6 team			1
the @entity8 defender was an important player under @entity9 but since he left the club , the left back has found his game time limited			1
speaking to @entity12 , he admitted he could n't get his head around the decisions being made			2
' i do not understand			2
i have also got no explanation as to why i do n't play			2
@entity0 ( centre ) says he 's baffled by @entity2 ' decision to drop him from the starting 11 ' even if my ( left - back rival ) is injured or suspended i do n't get a chance			1
that 's frustrating because i feel very happy in @entity23 and i have a good relationship with the fans			0
' @entity0 insists that he does n't want to be one of the those players to throw a strop but may be forced to consider his long - term future			1
he said : ' i will not cause trouble , because i am not that type , the end of the season is approaching and i am waiting for the club to tell me their plans			0
' after i played 15 good games , i know that some clubs have followed me			0
it is too early to talk about that , but i want to stay in the @entity41			0
' i have a good life here and at age 27 i think of everything			0
but i am also open to a new league			0
' it 's been a turbulent season for @entity6 but has improved since @entity2 took over from @entity9			1

since @entity2 took charge at @entity6 , @entity0 has found game time hard to come by and *midfielder* @entity52 *ahead* of him
the left back ca n't understand why he does n't get *picked* to play
@entity0 was a regular under @entity9 before he was *sacked*
