a police force is under fire after it asked candidates to send in a ' selfie ' before applying for the role of deputy chief constable			1
potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to @entity8 in order to request an application pack for the £ 117,000 - a - year job			1
but the force is now facing a backlash , with critics branding the request ' bizarre ' and ' demeaning '			1
some have warned that it could lead the legality of the process to be called into question , while others said that it could effect the opportunities of women and other minority groups			0
' bizarre ' : potential candidates have been asked to email a photograph of themselves to @entity8 in order to request an application pack for the £ 117,000 - a - year role of deputy chief constable the advertisement was posted on the @entity8 website with the tagline ' new year , new you , new force '			1
before listing the job description and salary details , the advertisement asks applicants to ' send a photo along with your name and force ' to an email address provided			2
the advertisement has been defended by chief constable @entity46 who said it was ' vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology '			1
but it was was criticised by @entity53 mp @entity52 , representing @entity54 & @entity55 and the @entity56 , who called the request ' strange '			0
he told @entity59 : ' this seems a very bizarre requirement and i can not understand what possible benefit there can be to such an ask			2
' i hope @entity8 will reconsider this strange decision			1
' @entity68 councillor @entity67 said it was ' demeaning and a bit discriminating ' , adding : ' it makes you wonder whether they want a new @entity74 or a new @entity75			2
' under fire : chief constable @entity46 defended the decision , saying it was ' vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology ' @entity81 , a psychologist and head of r&d at @entity84 , said that the photos have the potential to give away information such as an applicant 's age , sex and race			1
he explained that while there was no indication that @entity8 intended to make any decisions based on this information , just having it available could potentially ' be dangerous '			1
meanwhile the women 's organisation , the largest developer and deliverer of training and support targeting women in the @entity103 , warned that it could effect the opportunities of women and minority groups			0
@entity107 , the organisation 's ceo , said : ' the person posting this advert has proven they are really out of kilter with equal opportunities practice and they need to get a grip			2
' who issued this or approved it ? – i ’m happy to come up there and help them to get into the 21st century			0
' while it is not illegal for an employer to ask potential applicants to send in a photo , legal complications could arise depending on how those photos are later used			2
@entity128 , a partner at @entity129 , the @entity103 's largest specialist employment law firm , warned other employers not to follow the example of @entity8			1
ms @entity128 pointed out that it could potentially raise issues regarding discrimination and data protection			0
she said : ' there is the chance that unsuccessful candidates might consider that they have been discriminated against if they are not shortlisted for interview based on the photo , for instance if they are from a minority ethnic group			0
' also , there is the question of what the police do with the ' selfies ' afterwards			0
' broadly speaking , under data protection laws they 'd have to safely dispose of it once it was no longer necessary to them , but they are creating a compliance problem for themselves to ensure this is done correctly , especially where information is shared internally on emails			0
' apparently the police 's request is because they are looking for it - literate candidates			0
' i 'd strongly recommend that employers put in place a more appropriate way of testing candidates for basic it - literacy , such as a short test before a first interview '			0
@entity171 , @entity172 at the @entity173 , the professional body for @entity176 and people development , acknowledged the request for ' selfies ' could be relevant for roles where applicants need to be comfortable with social media and technologies			0
backlash : the move was criticised by politicians who branded the post , pictured , ' demeaning ' and ' bizarre ' she added : ' while legitimate questions should be asked about the wisdom of asking for ' selfies ' in job applications , @entity193 and @entity194 – where photos are expected – are increasingly important parts of many organisations ' recruitment processes , so the genie may well already be out of the bottle			1
but she warned that managers involved in recruiting should be given training to ensure ' that conscious and unconscious bias is not triggered by visual images of potential recruits			0
' chief constable @entity46 defended the move saying it was ' vital candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology ' as the force had invested heavily in new equipment to modernise the way they work			1
she explained the force had ' invested heavily in new technology in a bid to modernise the way we work '			0
chief @entity218 said : ' we currently have a vacancy for a deputy chief constable which is a key role within the force and as such it is vital that potential candidates understand the importance of embracing new technology within @entity8 at the point of applying for the role			1
' this is why we have created a recruitment advert that reflects our aims and ambitions as a force by encouraging candidates to get involved from the outset			2

@entity8 posted advert for deputy chief constable on website
asked those *interested* to send selfie in order to receive application packs
decision has been dismissed as ' bizarre ' and ' demeaning ' by critics
