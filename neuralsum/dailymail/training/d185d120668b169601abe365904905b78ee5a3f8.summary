@entity0 is going to great lengths to improve its image and win over customers , but it has topped a list of the ten least client - friendly airlines , according to a new consumer survey			1
the list , which places @entity9 joint sixth with four other major international carriers , is based on how passengers are treated when making complaints			1
@entity13 , a @entity14 consumer organisation which conducted the survey , claims @entity0 ' does not accept to resolve complaints amicably			1
@entity0 has topped a @entity14 consumer organisation 's list of the top ten ' least client - friendly ' airlines ticket surcharges and a lack of assistance during delays are common complaints about @entity0 ' it always demands legal action , but does not want to see a judgement go against it , so typically settles out of court before a hearing			1
' @entity13 also claims that , in the vast majority of cases , the airline denies clients the right to meals and refreshments in case of delays exceeding two hours			2
in addition , @entity0 has a ticket sales surcharge of € 2.50 ( approximately £ 2 ) each way to fund compensation in case of delays			0
in a statement , @entity0 told @entity47 : ' this survey , which was produced by a @entity14 claims website , is of dubious merit when @entity0 ’s traffic continues to grow strongly to 90m customers this year			2
' and according to the consumer organisation , @entity9 has the same policy as @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , which tied for sixth			1
@entity59 said : ' never mediate			0
to summarise , the approach of these airlines would be " step on you [ the client ] , do not answer "			0
@entity9 finished in sixth place with four other major international carriers ' and if they do respond , it is to say that the traveller is not entitled to compensation without further explanation			0
' @entity14 's national carrier , @entity72 , is listed on the consumer website as the third most unfriendly airline			1
the airline is part of @entity76 , which followed after its merger with @entity9			2
@entity14 national airline , @entity72 , is listed as the third most unfriendly airline to unhappy passengers @entity13 accused @entity72 of setting a benchmark ' to hinder the claims process with unnecessary bureaucracy			1
' it said : ' sell tickets at a click , yet when the time comes , even just to read claims , it requires signed handwritten documents , @entity89 [ identity cards ] , commute tickets , @entity93 complaint forms , etc. for you to receive an answer			0
' different excuses are given on the same flight to different customers , using standard templates with ambiguous content			0
' when you have to go to court , many times the company acquiesces , which means that it acknowledges guilt and pays one day before the hearing			0
' with this attitude , one gets delayed payment to travellers and the collapse of the @entity14 system to their advantage , showing a complete lack of respect to both			0
