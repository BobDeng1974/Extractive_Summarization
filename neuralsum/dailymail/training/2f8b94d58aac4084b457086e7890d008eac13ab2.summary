the @entity17 native , who describes herself as bisexual , said that she has n't told them that she has been writing sex columns , though she suspects her father may have caught wind of it what with the furor surrounding her much talked about piece			2
‘ i 'm not sure any parent expects this			0
but i mean , what can you do ? i just do n't talk to my parents about sex , ’ she said			2
@entity33 , a junior at the prestigious @entity35 school , went from a virtual unknown to a branded sex expert after writing a column for her college paper about how she had sex all over campus			1
the article published in the @entity43 caught the attention of global media outlets , among them the @entity47 and the @entity48 , which ended up hiring @entity33 as its newest sex columnist			1
but speaking to the @entity51 this week , the petite 20 - year - old dismissed her newfound exposure with a shrug and a sarcastic reply			2
' unless one day i 'm going to work for @entity56 , i think i 'm fine , ’ she said			2
while headhunters and job experts are busy warning young people to keep their online presence squeaky clean so as not to scare off potential employers later in life , @entity33 does n't seem to worried that a @entity64 search of her name yields the term ' sexcapade			1
' @entity4 student @entity3 's @entity69 reads : ' i like coffee , cats , and ice cream			1
and being the sex on tuesday columnist at the @ dailycal : ) ' online history : while educators warn young people about keep their web presence clean for professional reasons , @entity33 , seen here apparently smoking pot , is not concerned that her sex escapade would harm her career @entity33 's detailed account was part of her weekly column in the @entity43 , @entity4 ’s independent , student - run newspaper			1
@entity33 wrote that she and an unnamed male student started their romp in @entity4 ’s library , @entity93 , the day before @entity94 , when the campus was ‘ marvelously empty			1
' but other students were in the library studying while the two performed and more than one student walked by them in mid-act , @entity33 wrote			1
she and her partner then moved into one of @entity4 ’s classrooms , as she graphically described			1
‘ sex is n’t always about c * * * * * * and having orgasms			2
sometimes it ’s for s * * * * and giggles , ’ she wrote			0
‘ having expectations and goals can ruin the fun of it			0
besides , it ’s probably not a good idea to ejaculate in public places - just saying			0
keep this in mind should you ever attempt sex on campus			1
’ @entity33 wrote that her experience was inspired by a spring 2012 column for the paper , ‘ sex on campus : actually doable ? ’ her response : ‘ yes - having sex on campus is actually very doable , and it ’s lots of fun			1
it ’s also surprisingly easy			0

i intended to do it			0
i do n't really mind that people know i 'm having sex			0
and who cares if it 's online - what is n't ? ’ @entity33 was taken aback by the uproar over her piece			1
in her earlier sex on tuesdays columns , she has addressed the etiquette of taking part in a threesome , taking the stigma out of watching porn , and bisexuality , but her writing has generated little reaction on campus			2
even the now famous column drew only a few comments from fellow students , some of whom were critical of her purported exhibitionism , before the mainstream media became aware of her escapade			0
