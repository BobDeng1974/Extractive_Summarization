by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 16 august 2013 ' the whole reason i got braces was because @entity4 [ @entity5 ] got braces , ' says @entity7			1
' i did n't really need braces but i wanted them because they look good and because @entity4 had them			0
' @entity7 , a sweet - faced girl of 17 from @entity11 , is a ' @entity12 ' , which means like millions of other teenagers , she lives and breathes @entity15			1
but while teenage fandom is nothing new , the @entity12 ' love for @entity17 , 20 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity5 , all 19 , and @entity20 , 21 , goes beyond anything previously seen			1
and as @entity39 discovered when it straplined a @entity18 cover with the words he 's @entity42 , they are n't above sending eye - opening abuse to anyone who they believe has traduced their idols			0
' @entity49 * * * at @entity48 , ' read one			0
another @entity12 tweeted : ' i 'll f * * * you up @entity39 , i swear you 've messed with the wrong people '			2
so who are these extreme fans and what makes them go to such lengths to defend - and be noticed by - their idols ? those are just some of the questions director @entity59 attempts to answer in new @entity61 documentary , @entity63 about one direction			1
among them is @entity7 , a pretty girl with long dark hair who spends her spare time getting misty - eyed about @entity17 - and the rest caring for a disabled mother and younger brother			2
it 's hard not to warm to @entity7 and harder still not to feel a pang of sympathy when she says : ' i would do literally anything to be with @entity17			1
they 're like my identity so i 'll love them forever			0
' when you feel shy and you feel scared and that , when you divert your mind to @entity15 , you just feel happy inside			2
' popular : despite only managing second place on the x-factor , @entity15 are the planet 's biggest band not so lucky : @entity39 's @entity33 account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its @entity15 cover you sympathise again when she waits for hours outside a press conference only for the band to zoom past with barely a wave to acknowledge her			1
heartbreakingly , it 's probably the closest she 'll ever come to them			0
for @entity7 , finding Â£ 40 or more for a concert ticket is an impossible dream			2
at the same time though , you 're left with a sneaking sympathy for the boys themselves , who despite the millions in the bank and the adulation , deal with daily intrusion on a massive scale			0
one scene shows 19 - year - old @entity106 from @entity107 giggling as she runs through a hotel in search of the band			1
' @entity17 ! @entity17 just ran away from me , ' she giggles tearfully into her @entity114 moments later			0
in the end , @entity106 and her friends do get to meet the band , albeit after waiting all night			0
but while @entity106 's activities are pretty harmless , if pretty irksome for the band members themselves , others take their love for the band to bizarre and even sinister levels			1
' i 'd rather not be best friends with them because of all the girls who would tell you to die and i would n't like that , ' says @entity106 in a later scene , referring to the abuse directed at anyone suspected of harbouring a romantic attachment to any of the boys			0
excitable : one direction are met by crowds of tearful , screaming fans wherever they go teen idols : the much - admired quintet on the set of their hit song what makes you beautiful bizarre : speculation on @entity18 and @entity147 ' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by fan art such as this @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are just some of the women who 've endured a barrage of ire from @entity12 - to the point , in @entity153 's case , they left @entity33 altogether			1
then , there 's the popular @entity12 pastime of ' shipping @entity161 ' - speculating about the ' bromance , romance or just a nice friendship ' between band members @entity18 and @entity20			1
dubbed ' @entity166 ' by fans , conjecture about the boys ' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by toe - curling fan fiction and carefully drawn images detailing the ' proposal ' and the twosome curled with a baby between them			0
but not everyone is a fan of ' shipping @entity161 ' , it seems			0
' it makes me mad because it 's upsetting the boys , ' says one @entity12			1
@entity106 adds : ' some fans want them to be gay so they ca n't have a girlfriend			2
' ultimately , being a @entity12 is largely harmless and often fun , and allows fans the comforting sense of being part of something , of belonging , as @entity7 so clearly feels			1
' when you have all these other girls who love @entity15 , are mentally married to them , you feel part of this gang , ' she says			0
' i 'm part of being a @entity12 ... it 's like a cult or a sect or something			2
' a religion with @entity18 at its heart ? @entity153 ( ' i want to kill her for what she did to @entity18 , ' says one girl ) is probably quaking in her cowboy boots at the thought			0
crazy about one direction airs tonight on @entity61 at 10pm			2
