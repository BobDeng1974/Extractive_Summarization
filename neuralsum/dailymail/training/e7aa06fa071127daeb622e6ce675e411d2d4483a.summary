by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 25 december 2012 they do n't think much of @entity2 , @entity3 and do n't get them started on the @entity5			2
but for the past six years two pensioners from @entity7 have become household names thanks to their popular , no nonsense and heartwarming radio show			1
now @entity11 , 86 , and @entity12 , 91 , who with a combined age of 176 were a surprise hit at this year 's prestigious @entity15 , are getting ready to hang up their mikes at @entity17			1
the end of an era : @entity11 ( right ) , 86 , and @entity12 , 91 ( left ) will hang up their mikes on christmas day after six years broadcasting together the ladies met at the @entity22 afternoon club in @entity7 in 1999 after their husbands died and soon became firm friends			1
their radio show did not start until seven years later - in 2006 - when they and 15 other members of their ladies ’ @entity27 social group went on a tour of the @entity17 offices			1
producer @entity32 was looking for a new format for a show and was instantly charmed by the pair			2
he said : ‘ they were just very cheeky			0
they kept asking for records - first they wanted @entity40 , then @entity41 , then classical music			0
' then they started telling me i was good looking and ruffling my hair and giving me a squeeze			0
winners : @entity49 of @entity17 celebrates his award with ' co hosts ' @entity51 and @entity11 ‘ i was just interested in what older people had to say and what we could learn from them , and i thought lots of listeners would be , too			1
i think they thought it was a wind - up , but the second i heard their voices , i knew it would work			0
’ ' perfect man ' : the pair do n't think much of ' scruffy ' @entity2 , but they do have quite a thing for @entity68 friends at the station told the @entity71 they are a ' laugh a minute ' - a ' @entity73 ' pairing who often need a silencing nudge when talking about things they should not be			2
@entity51 ( described as the ' gobby one ' ) and @entity78 ( the @entity68 fanatic ) saw off established stars and much younger rivals to win the award for best entertainment programme at the @entity15 , the @entity83 of the @entity85 industry			1
the pair said they were more surprised than anyone to receive the award ahead of a shortlist of talent including comedian @entity92 and @entity71 's @entity93			0
at the time , the @entity15 radio award judges described the show as ‘ a joyous , entertaining double act , having fun with the medium and unconstrained by any ingrained ideas of what works and what does n’t			1
‘ they give a voice to a sector of society unrepresented on radio , and do it with a joy that puts many of their fellow broadcasters to shame			0
’ they put their success down to their very different personalities , and the fact they ' never stop talking '			0
mrs @entity12 said : ‘ and because we have lived full lives , people want to hear what we have to say			1
we are full of good advice			0
’ mrs @entity11 added : ‘ we are never scared to give a straight answer			2
if a caller has a dilemma , we do our best to help			0
and we do n’t get embarrassed , no matter what the subject matter is			0
’ while the firm friends will not be drawn on the reasons for their retirement , would they rule out a return to the airwaves , perhaps when mrs @entity12 reaches 100 ? ' i 'll make it , do n't you worry ' comes the reply .			1

@entity11 , 86 , and @entity12 , 91 , scooped a prestigious @entity15 for their show on @entity17
but after six years the firm friends have *decided* to hang up their mikes
