by @entity0 for @entity1 these touching pictures show baby chimpanzee @entity3 clinging to his mother for protection as he joins the rest of his family for the first time			1
with his fresh pink face , the eight - week - old and his mother @entity10 were integrated into the @entity13 enclosure at @entity14 today			1
the baby pure @entity17 chimpanzee – an endangered species – is the first to be successfully reared in @entity19 for 15 years			1
eight - week - old @entity3 is pictured clinging to his mother @entity10 ( left ) as he is welcomed at new enclosure @entity10 had been gradually integrated into the @entity13 enclosure at @entity14 but today was the first time @entity3 met his 18 other family members , who are originally from a zoo in the @entity24 he can be seen tentatively clinging to his mother while the rest of the chimps in his family ’s complex hierarchy swung on ropes and scavenged for food , though small and relatively bald at the moment , @entity3 will soon have a head of dark , spiky hair – but will probably stay tiny for another five years			1
his mother @entity10 is from a group of nine chimps who arrived at the zoo from the @entity24 in 2010			1
the @entity24 chimpanzees originally started life in a research laboratory , then were rehomed to @entity42 before moving to @entity14 , where they live in the @entity13 enclosure			1
after a shaky start , @entity10 is said to be a ‘ great mother ’ , grooming and protecting @entity3 who has been accepted by the other 18 chimps			1
there is some doubt over the paternity of @entity3 , but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the group , @entity54 or @entity55 , is the father and a test is due to be carried out in the future			2
@entity59 , team leader at the @entity13 , said : ‘ we are delighted with the arrival and successful integration of @entity3 into our chimpanzee group			2
‘ still very young , @entity3 will look like a baby for another five years or so			0
he currently has a beautiful pale , pinky - coloured face which will darken as he gets older and has a mass of spiky hair			0
the baby pure @entity17 chimpanzee – an endangered species – is the first to be successfully reared in @entity19 for 15 years and while small and relatively bald @entity3 is expected to grow a mass of spiky hair doubts remain over the paternity of @entity3 , but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the @entity54 or @entity55 - is his father			1
they will find out when they do a paternity test , which is due to happen in the future @entity10 ( pictured cradling @entity3 ) had a tricky start but is said to be coping extremely well with motherhood and zookeepers say she is a ‘ great mother ’ , grooming and protecting @entity3 who has been accepted by the group ‘ at @entity14 we are extremely proud that @entity10 is successfully raising @entity3 and that he has been accepted into the group			1
‘ chimpanzees learn from experience - they see their mothers and other group members give birth and raise youngsters - but unfortunately we suspect that @entity10 did not have this experience in the earlier part of her life			0
‘ however , after a tricky start , @entity10 is coping extremely well and developing into a great mother - she is nursing , grooming and protecting her baby			0
’ chimpanzee groups have a complex social hierarchy and can be a volatile species , so staff at the zoo had to take care when reintroducing @entity10 and @entity3 to the group			2
zookeepers intervened as little as they could but had to bottle - feed him in the first few days as @entity10 ( right ) showed little interest in @entity3 ( clinging to her ) the birth has boosted @entity10 ’s status in the group and @entity3 will probably grow to inherit his mother ’s ranking , the zoo said			1
‘ after the birth , we slowly integrated @entity10 and her baby back into the main chimpanzee group - starting first with other females and her closest male allies , then building up to them both going back into the main group , ’ ms @entity59 said			2
‘ this has been successful to date and , although chimpanzee babies are always vulnerable , we are confident @entity10 is fully integrated back into the group and has a lot of support from her chimp friends			0
‘ hand - rearing a chimpanzees has a huge impact on the individual as they are extremely intelligent with complex needs			0
a hand - reared chimp may , in fact , never fully be an independent chimp			0
‘ with this in mind , keepers intervened as little as possible - @entity3 had to be bottle - fed by keepers for a few days at the beginning of his life because @entity10 put him down and showed little interest in caring for him herself			2
‘ however , he was never out of @entity10 ’s sight and she was able to watch him being fed until she decided she wanted to take him back , which she did , to everyone ’s delight			0
’ chimpanzees are found in the rainforests of west and @entity149 and staff at @entity14 have tried to recreate the habit in the @entity13 enclosure			2
it features three pods which vary in degrees of temperature , light and humidity to reflect different conditions of the rainforest			0
‘ chimpanzee babies are absolutely gorgeous and the great thing about them from a visitor ’s point of view is that they stay babyish for a very long time , ’ ms @entity59 said			0
‘ a baby chimp does n’t really start growing up until they are five years old , so he ’ll be on his mother ’s back and be very playful and look cute for several years			0
