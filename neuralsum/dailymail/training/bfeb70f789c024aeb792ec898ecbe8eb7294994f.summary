by @entity0 honestly ! you 'd think i 'd have grown out of celebrity crushes by now , would n't you ? ok , i no longer stick posters of boy band hunks on my bedroom wall , but my fascination for famous faces remains			1
despite the fact that i now get targeted by paparazzi photographers and even sign the occasional autograph , i still love celebrity gossip and i 'm obsessed with @entity14 fashion and beauty			0
my latest superstar style crush is @entity17 , the gorgeous actress and girlfriend of @entity19			1
famed for her glossy brunette locks and sultry beauty , i think she 's incredible , so for this week 's blog i decided to recreate her signature smoky - eyed glamour			1
this creates a perfect even canvas for colours , as well as fixing eye make - up in place and preventing eyeshadow creases			2
@entity46 @entity17 has fabulously strong , dark brows so use the dark brown eyeshadow shade from the @entity49 in @entity50 to emphasise your own			2
simply follow the natural line of your brows , applying colour with a small , angled brush			0
@entity0 recommends using a primer to fully prep your face in order to prevent makeup from slipping @entity58 next , using a larger brush , blend the nude / brown shade from the @entity62 palette across your lids , creating a subtle base of pretty colour and adding depth to the eyes			1
going back to the darker brown shade , add a stronger wash of colour at the corners of your lids , winging it out towards your brows , along the lower lash line and around the eye			0
next up , apply the sparkly grey - brown shade from the same palette along your upper and lower lash lines , using a small , angled brush			2
finally , apply the glistening golden shade from the @entity62 palette to the centre of your lid			0
this look calls for quite a lot of colour on your eyes , so the key is to blend carefully so each shade merges subtly into the next			2
@entity0 says it 's important to blend your eyeshadow so that one shade merges into the next fine lines now draw a dark eyeliner along your upper and lower lash lines , and inside the water line - i used @entity94 in @entity95			1
this will emphasise your eyes and really strengthen that dark , smoky - eyed effect			1
finish up with lashings of @entity100 mascara to really finesse your eye make - up			0
@entity102 a @entity0 look has to include bronzer - even if it 's a @entity17 - influenced @entity0 look ! take a large fluffy brush and swish it across both shades in the @entity107 , then apply the colour anywhere the sun would hit your face			1
next brush a soft , shimmery blusher across the apples of your cheeks - i used @entity116 in @entity117 - to add a healthy @entity119 glow to your complexion			0
a perfect @entity121 the focus of this look is the sultry eyes , so i 've taken a tip from @entity17 's book and stuck to a nude lip colour			1
apply @entity128 straight from the tube and smudge your lips together to achieve a soft , neutral finish			0
i reckon this a gorgeous result , one @entity17 herself would be proud of ! if there 's a @entity14 star whose hair or make - up look you 'd like to recreate , just drop me a line and i 'll try to help out			1
you 'll find all the products i 've used today at online beauty boutique escentual.com			0
the focus of this look is sultry eyes so @entity0 recommends keeping to subtle colours for your lips on another note , i ’m currently testing my willpower by taking part in the @entity147 launched by @entity148 @entity149 @entity151 – it ’s a challenge encouraging the nation to give up caffeine for 10 days			1
so far , so good … i ’ve replaced my usual coffee with the tasty new @entity156 and have been exercising first thing in the morning to kick - start my metabolism			0
