she might have been asked for a kiss during her trip to @entity3 last week , but the @entity4 got a very different reception when she met a bashful little flower girl in @entity7 today			0
@entity8 , who was at the breakfast reception to launch the @entity12 's @entity11 bid at the @entity13 in @entity7 with her father , was overcome by nerves when the royal guest approached and buried her face in her father 's shoulder			1
luckily , the @entity4 , who was dressed in pretty nautical - inspired cream and navy shift dress by high street favourite @entity24 , was n't at all put out and smiled and chatted with @entity8 and her father @entity26 , a three - time @entity11 veteran , as she - eventually - was handed her posy			1
the pair were joined by another famous sailing fan , @entity61 star @entity60 , who is also supporting the @entity12 bid to take the @entity11 , the oldest trophy in sport			1
known affectionately as the ' @entity11 ' , the cup was first offered as a prize by @entity67 in 1851 , who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the @entity72			2
after a schooner named @entity74 from @entity75 took the trophy , which was made especially for the race by jewellers @entity79 , the cup was renamed in its honour , and both cup and race have carried the moniker ever since			0
a two - yacht race , the @entity11 is fought between the previous year 's winner - known as the ' defender ' - and a challenger , which is usually the best boat from a series of run - off rounds			2
all smiles : @entity40 of @entity41 seemed in good spirits as she toured the @entity13 and met supporters of the @entity11 bid close inspection : @entity40 of @entity41 takes a closer look at the @entity11 or , as it 's also known to sailing fans , ' the @entity11 ' @entity98 to meet you : @entity40 of @entity41 chats to @entity100 , ceo of jewellers @entity79 which made queen @entity103 's trophy , and giggles with sir @entity37 @entity105 plans : sir @entity37 hopes to have found a boat - and the crew to man it - capable of taking the oldest trophy in sporty by 2017 prestigious : @entity40 was at the @entity13 and was joined by sir @entity37 who is fronting the bid for an @entity11 team eyes on the prize : @entity40 of @entity41 joins sir @entity37 in front of the @entity11 which has never ( yet ) been won by a @entity12 team tour : @entity40 of @entity41 was shown around the @entity13 by sir @entity37 before posing for photos with the bid team and the cup blooming lovely : @entity40 was handed a pretty posy of summer flowers as she toured the @entity13 and met well - wishers @entity24 crepe dress with navy trim at @entity125 ( now £ 99 ) @entity126 sizes available ! visit site dressing to the occasion is one of the @entity4 's many talents so it was fitting to see her embrace the warm sunny spell wearing one of the freshest pieces your wardrobe will ever own ; the white dress			1
@entity139 is working an effortlessly elegant aesthetic in her sleek white pencil dress from @entity24 which features contrast navy piping around the neckline , shoulders and waist			1
the ladylike , knee - length style combined with the crisp white crepe fabric make this a stunning summer season staple so if you want to emulate @entity139 's look then click right to @entity151 now where it 's currently on sale for just £ 99 ... did n't manage to get one in time ? tap into the chic trend by shopping our pick of similar styles below from the likes of @entity159 and @entity160 before teaming with a pair of understated courts like @entity139 for the most sophisticated of finishes			1
@entity159 black and white pencil dress visit site @entity167 insert dress visit site @entity170 animal textured shift dress visit site the one dress from @entity174 at @entity160 visit site gusty : despite the clear skies , a stiff breeze played havoc with the @entity33 ' hair surprise ! @entity40 gasps as her carefully coiffed hair is blasted by a breeze interesting plans : @entity40 looked on intently as she listened to sir @entity37 chivalrous : olympic gold medal winning sailor sir @entity37 was on hand to greet the @entity4 as she arrived at the @entity13 in @entity7 looking good : @entity40 , a keen sailor herself , plumped for a nautical look and even wore a delicate gold starfish chain in addition to her trademark drop earrings it might be named for the new world , but the @entity11 has very @entity12 origins			1
first offered by @entity67 in 1851 , the inaugural @entity11 race was run around the @entity72			2
after a boat from @entity75 named @entity74 triumphed , the cup was renamed and teams from the @entity201 have dominated the winner 's roll call of honour ever since			0
but while @entity206 might rule the waves in other respects , a @entity12 team is yet to take the trophy which , despite having been won by @entity211 and @entity212 teams in the past , has for the most part been doggedly defended by the @entity201 - among them last year 's winner , @entity216 's @entity215 - throughout its 132 - year history			1
that , however , is something @entity40 of @entity41 and sir @entity37 hope to change , and hope , given enough sponsorship , to assemble a race - winning boat and the sailors to crew it over the next three years			1
after chatting with sponsors , among them former @entity61 star @entity60 , the @entity4 toured the museum and was handed a posy by a little flower girl who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the royal visitor			0
it was a far cry from the @entity4 ' last engagement - a tea party in @entity237 for d - day veterans , where she was given a peck on the cheek by one octogenarian who asked her whether it was ' ok to kiss a princess '			0
@entity244 , 88 , was one of 50 veterans to meet the royal couple and was told , ' of course it is ' when he made his cheeky request			0
but the @entity250 's kiss from a princess did earn him a jokey telling off from the @entity41 - much to his delight			2
mr @entity244 , from @entity254 , added : ' as the @entity255 left he said to me : " were you chatting up my wife ? " i told him i only gave her a kiss			0
@entity261 laughed but i ’m chuffed i ’ve chatted up a princess			0
i bet i ’ll be picked up now and taken to the @entity263 ! ' it was a lovely kiss – she is very sweet and very lovely			0
i lost my wife 10 years ago and i ’m on my own now so i do n’t get many opportunities for kisses any more			0
' afterwards , the @entity4 and her husband @entity261 continued on to @entity269 , which was was one of two subjected to an assault by @entity12 troops , and where they were shown a reconstruction of the events of that day			2
leading the charge was the @entity277 commanded by major general @entity278 , and the 8th @entity279 , but despite the presence of some of the veterans , the fierce fighting also saw more than 400 @entity12 soldiers lose their lives			0
grand arrival : @entity40 of @entity41 arrives for a breakfast reception to support the launch of @entity12 's bid for glory in the @entity11 2017 looking good : @entity40 was at the @entity13 to help sir @entity37 launch @entity12 's bid for the @entity11 in 2017 a venue fit for a princess ! sir @entity37 leads the @entity4 into the @entity13 in @entity7 for the @entity11 reception looking good : the ever - thrifty @entity4 chose a £ 150 cream and navy crepe shift dress by @entity12 high street brand @entity24 that is now reduced to just £ 99 @entity298 : despite the beautiful sunny weather in @entity7 , a stiff breeze blowing in off the @entity301 appeared to play havoc with the @entity4 ' glossy locks meeting : sir @entity37 introduces the @entity4 to some of the sponsors and well - wishers supporting the @entity12 bid to win the @entity11 solo : former @entity61 frontman @entity60 ( left ) was on hand to support the @entity4 as she made her first solo public appearance since the @entity212 tour friendly chat : @entity40 of @entity41 was greeted by crowds of well - wishers as she arrived at the @entity13 in @entity7 launch : @entity40 is supporting the @entity12 bid to win the @entity11 which has mostly been won @entity201 throughout its 132 - year history			1
