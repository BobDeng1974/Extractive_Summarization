hungry : this greedy gator saw a pink flip - flop as a meal jaws - some : the huge alligator was spotted eyeing up the strange snack before chomping down on it in @entity14 in @entity16 the gator was spotted by @entity12 , who lives just metres from the salt marshes the reptile frequents @entity12 , who was just a few feet away from the action , said he often came face to face with hungry alligators on the hunt for food but was shocked to see this one polish off the rubbery flip flip in a matter of seconds			1
he said : ‘ i was watching this alligator as it slowly floated around in the marsh pond			0
‘ i could immediately tell something along the edge of the pond caught his attention as he started going into a stealthy stalking mode			0
fishing : maybe the alligator was looking for some sole surprised : the photographer was convinced the alligator would spit the shoe out flip flops might be too much even for an alligators sturdy stomach ‘ i figured he had spotted a crab or big fish and was headed over to see if he could snag it			2
‘ there was some sort of pink coloured debris there in the reeds that i had previously noticed but i did n't think the gator was interested in that			0
‘ well it turns out that was precisely what caught the alligator 's attention and once he grabbed it and lifted it up , i recognized it as a pink rubber flip flop sandal			2
‘ at this point i assumed he would bite down on the shoe , realize it was inedible , and spit it back out			2
down the hatch : in the end the animal swallowed the flip flop - but later had a confused look on its face , according to the photographer who took these shots of it ‘ but to my surprise he proceeded to carry the flip flop out from the reeds and back into the pond			1
‘ i was still waiting for him to discard the rubber shoe but to my horror the alligator chewed down on the pink sandal a few more times before finally gulping it down whole			0
‘ i know that alligators will pick up and sometimes eat all sorts of things but i 'm not sure if it can successfully break down and pass a rubber shoe , or if it will clog up the alligator 's digestive system			0
‘ after swallowing the flip flop the alligator floated over near to my location and had a bit of a confused look on his face as if he was trying to decide if perhaps eating that shoe may not have been a wise decision			1
‘ i 've been keeping my eye out for him ever since and will continue to do so			0

the shoe - loving animal was spotted at @entity14 in @entity16
it eventually swallowed the flip flop whole - then ' looked confused '
