and so at lunchtime on monday comes what could be the last formality in the life of @entity4 , reigning @entity5 champion - opening up the @entity7 programme at the allotted time at 1pm			1
save for the traditional set played on saturday between four lady members it will be a pristine new grass court , reserved for last year ’s winner and free of the dusty ruts that will develop between now and a week on sunday			1
come july 6 there is , genuinely , the chance that @entity4 will be holding the trophy aloft again and taking us back to that extraordinary afternoon 50 weeks ago , the memory of which even now has a surreal tinge			1
this fascinating alteration of personnel apart , in most ways @entity4 ’s reign as champion has been more notable for what has not happened during it rather than what actually did			1
the 27 year - old @entity47 did not sweep all before him on the court , he did not multiply his personal fortune many times , his victory has not led to a wider upturn in @entity54 tennis fortunes , he has not changed discernibly as a person			1
he did not even go out and treat himself to something special as a reward for achieving his life ’s dream , although he did buy and renovate a hotel near his hometown of @entity63			2
mentor : @entity4 shakes hands with his new coach @entity66 ( right ) following the practice session last time a @entity54 man successfully defended a @entity69			1
@entity70 won @entity5 from 1934 to 1936			1
he also won the @entity71 in 1933 and 1934			1
@entity4 himself is pleased , even relieved , that this is the case			1
it may have been the most unexpected bonus that came with ending @entity54 ’s 77 - year drought in terms of a male champion			1
maybe abroad i get recognised more than i used to but in terms of what i do on a day - to - day basis , nothing is different , ' he says			2
' for me , that has probably been the nicest part about it because that was something i was worried about			2
i had spoken to psychologists before and told them that was something that concerned me			2
i spoke to @entity35 about it			2
' what is nice is coming back and seeing your name on the wall because there 's great history attached to the tournament			2
most of the greatest players who have ever played have won here - it ’s something no - one can take away from you			1
the wait is over : @entity4 became the first @entity54 man for 77 years to win the @entity5 title in 2013 ' nowadays it is a place i like going to because it is quiet			1
i like to go to @entity5 to practise sometimes , or just to be there			2
it is a place where i can go and i do n’t get bothered			2
' @entity4 ’s kit from the final now sits on show in the @entity115 ’s museum , although he has never been to inspect it , while the trophy is in a room at home he rarely enters			1
you sense that he does not want to allow himself too much reflection until retirement , partly due to the admission that winning sapped his determination for several months afterwards			0
' it was different , not having motivation , that ’s not a nice feeling because i ’m used to being extremely motivated , so there are parts that made me happy and there were some things like struggling to get up for practices and training - that was n’t that nice			0
when i decided to have surgery ( in late september ) , that was when i moved on			0
' the existential feelings after @entity5 and three - month hiatus caused by surgery are clearly major factors in why he has not even reached a final since @entity5 last year			1
all set : @entity4 hits under the watchful eye of coach @entity66 ( centre ) and assistant @entity146 ( left ) the reluctance to put himself out for the corporate world and a lack of enthusiasm for material gain are among the factors why he has barely cashed in on last year ’s triumph ( although he has still chosen to chase beefed up appearance fees on occasion			1
) in fact , until signing a patch deal last week with @entity158 he was looking the most undersponsored superstar of any sport			0
asked if this has cost him much money he sheepishly nods			0
' there have been quite a few offers but for me it about doing the right stuff and working with people who understand what my goals are and what i am trying to do			0
it is very easy to sign five or six deals but i want to play tennis and concentrate on trying to win more			0
' this past week , for example , it is incredibly important for me to prepare properly and train properly and practise and stuff and i do n’t want to give up loads of my time			0
for a lot of those companies , that is a bit off - putting as this is the time of the year that they want to be doing loads of things			1
' some players are fine doing a lot the week before a @entity69 , but that ’s not for me			0
' focused : @entity4 will open the play on @entity7 against @entity194 @entity193 on monday one other thing has not happened since last year : despite him pledging to do so @entity4 has not declared his thoughts on @entity198 independence , opting instead to drop subtle hints of pro-union tendencies			1
another of those may be his choice of new sponsor – @entity158 being among the companies who have warned they may move south in the event of a @entity209 vote			0
of more relevance to this fortnight is the fact that the name " @entity66 " is likely to be used more than that of ‘ @entity70 ’			1
if there is ever to be a matching statue at @entity5 bearing the name ‘ @entity4 ’ he wants it to be earned			1
' i do n’t know if there will ever be one			0
@entity70 won @entity5 three times			2
i ’ve still got a long way to go			0
i never met him but he is a very relevant person in my career because i got asked about him for a long , long time			0
' with history out of the way , it should in theory be easier to add to his two @entity69 titles			0
i am moving well and my body feels good			0
it is not sore , so it is down to me to perform and to play well			0
i have prepared pretty much the best that i could			0
' meeting the press : @entity4 speaks to the media during a press conference at the @entity28 on sunday this is just as well because there is no sign of the competition going away and after some wobbles and injury concerns the old ‘ @entity243 ’ are still the quartet to beat			1
for @entity246 it is a case of needing to lift himself after yet another @entity69 disappointment when he lost in the @entity250 final to @entity21			0
the @entity251 has reached two semis and three finals in his last five majors and not converted one into a title			2
that may be more relevant than concerns last week over his wrist			0
@entity21 ’s latest win in @entity261 had all his traditional hallmarks , publicly expressing fears about form and fitness early on and then brilliantly building up to a crescendo of form by the end			0
on the lawn ; @entity21 takes a seat during a practice session ahead of the @entity5 championships that kind of pattern suggests he will not fall flat again at this year ’s @entity5 , although his grass court defeats in recent years have come often enough to have left some mental scar tissue			1
should he get through some awkward - looking early opponents he will be hugely dangerous , the clear favourite to me as he is the man who best knows how to win when it most matters			0
@entity282 looks threatening again this year , and this is the one place he may be able to sustain a run of seven matches			2
the clearest outside threat to the @entity243 – and potentially @entity4 in the quarters - may be @entity289 ’s champion @entity288 , or the gargantuan - serving @entity290			1
you suspect this @entity5 will go more to form than was , gloriously , the case in 2013 , with better weather a factor			0
expect to see three of the main four joined by one interloper in the semi-finals .			0

the @entity301 is *hoping* to defend the title he memorably won at @entity303 last year
