three quarters of gps want to charge foreigners for appointments , figures show			1
they say too many migrants and tourists are abusing the @entity8 , which is already under immense pressure			1
many want foreigners to be regarded as private patients and made to pay at the surgery reception either by card or cash			0
three quarters of gps want to charge foreigners for appointments as they fear too many migrants and tourists are abusing the @entity8 , which is already under immense pressure ( stock picture ) a private gp appointment typically costs £ 70 and from then on overseas patients would also have to pay for blood tests , scans or drugs			1
ministers have warned that the @entity8 is becoming an ‘ international health service ’ and overseas patients not entitled to free care racking up bills of up to £ 300 million year			1
they have proposed a series of measures to crackdown on the problem including a pilot scheme last month to check the documents of all new patients registering with a gp			0
at present , gp appointments and treatment are free for all overseas patients although they are meant to pay for most hospital procedures			1
but family doctors say that the current system makes them a gateway for foreigners abusing free hospital treatment			2
dr @entity47 , deputy chair of the @entity48 , argues the @entity8 should remain free for anyone who needed to use it this is because staff rarely bother to check patients ’ nationalities and whether they should be paying as they assume that if they have a gp referral they are eligible for free @entity8 care			1
a survey of 515 @entity57 found that 77 per cent were in favour of ‘ upfront ’ charges for foreign patients			2
one , dr @entity61 , a gp in @entity62 , @entity63 , said : ‘ it is a sad reality but there is abuse of the @entity8 by foreign visitors			2
‘ it is only fair that they pay upfront if they are not entitled to free care on the @entity8			1
‘ the @entity8 is in trouble and it is only right that the government stops anyone from taking advantage of a system that is already under immense pressure			1
another dr @entity81 , a gp in @entity82 , @entity80 pointed out that @entity84 patients do n’t get free care abroad there is no reason the @entity8 should pay for foreigners			1
‘ we do not get free care abroad			0
another anonymous gp said : ‘ gp should be able to charge patient as if he is private patient and give private prescription			0
why should we do work free of charge for patients not entitled to @entity8 treatment			1
one other doctor , who did not reveal their name said : ‘ these patients need to be treated as private patient			0
‘ gps should charge fee and give private prescription			0
most of money should go to @entity38			0
’ but other doctors said the @entity8 should remain free for anyone who needed to use it			2
dr @entity47 , deputy chair of the @entity48 , which represents doctors said : ‘ quite a significant majority of gps for as long as i have known have supported charging foreign visitors for @entity8 care			1
‘ they see this as one of the solutions for the demand			0
‘ but i think they are mistaken			0
i believe in universal health care			2
if they bring in these charges , where do you stop ? this will be counterproductive			0
’ last month the @entity122 announced a pilot whereby all new patients registering at a gp would have to prove they are either @entity84 citizens or if from the @entity126 , show their @entity125			0
the scheme will initially involve ten practices as part of a series of measures aimed at getting gps in the habit of checking if patients are entitled to free care .			0
