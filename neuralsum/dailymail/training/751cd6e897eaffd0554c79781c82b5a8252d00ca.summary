by @entity0 in a blow to ‘ green ’ fuel campaigners , a recent study has shown that biofuels made from the leftovers of corn plants are worse than petrol in releasing harmful emissions			1
the find directly challenges both @entity11 and @entity12 policymakers who claim biofuels are a much cleaner oil alternative and could help combat climate change			0
but a $ 500,000 ( £ 297,000 ) by the @entity12 government claims that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 per cent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared with conventional petrol			1
in a blow to ' green ' fuel campaigners , a recent study has shown that biofuels made from the leftovers of corn plants are worse than petrol for global warming while biofuels are better in the long run , the @entity28 study claims they wo n't meet a standard set in a 2007 @entity12 energy law to qualify as renewable fuel			1
however , the biofuel industry and @entity12 administration immediately criticised the research as flawed			2
they said it was too simplistic in its analysis of carbon loss from soil , which can vary over a single field , and vastly overestimated how much residue farmers actually would remove once the market gets underway			1
' the core analysis depicts an extreme scenario that no responsible farmer or business would ever employ because it would ruin both the land and the long - term supply of feedstock			2
it makes no agronomic or business sense , ’ said @entity56 , global business director for biorefineries at @entity58			2
while biofuels are better in the long run , the study claims they wo n't meet a standard set in a 2007 to qualify as renewable fuel			1
pictured is equipment inside a pilot plant in @entity67 which turns corn cob into cellulosic ethanol , a precursor to a commercial - scale biorefinery planned for @entity72 , @entity73 later this year the company is scheduled to finish a $ 200 million ( £ 119 million ) facility in @entity76 , @entity73 , that will produce 30 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol using corn residue from nearby farms			2
an assessment paid for by @entity58 said that the ethanol it will produce there could be more than 100 per cent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions			1
the research is among the first to attempt to quantify , over 12 @entity88 states , how much carbon is lost to the atmosphere when the stalks , leaves and cobs that make up residue are removed and used to make biofuel , instead of left to naturally replenish the soil with carbon			1
the study found that regardless of how much corn residue is taken off the field , the process contributes to global warming			0
‘ i knew this research would be contentious , ’ said @entity104 , the lead author and an assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the @entity28			2
‘ i 'm amazed it has not come out more solidly until now			0
' motorists could pay almost £ 200 ( $ 336 ) a year more for petrol when a new green fuel is introduced in line with @entity115 rules , experts have warned			2
their tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient , increase @entity121 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles			1
it is set to be introduced because of an @entity115 directive saying that major suppliers must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol			2
many oil companies have decided to use bio-ethanol , made from corn , sugar cane and rapeseed			0
the new eco-fuel , @entity135 , contains 10 per cent bio-ethanol , compared with up to 5 per cent in the @entity138 unleaded blend currently on sale			2
the @entity140 requires 5 per cent of road transport energy to be from renewable sources this year , and 10 per cent by 2020 , in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming			1
but while ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol , it supplies around 30 per cent less energy			1
this means cars will use more of the new fuel , costing drivers more			0
what car ? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump , hose filter and injector blockages			2
it is also corrosive to some seals , plastics and metals ‘ and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure ’			0
the fuel leads to increased @entity121 emissions from car exhaust pipes			0
however , green groups such as the @entity170 say this would be offset since crops used to make it absorb co2 as they grow			0
what car ? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump , hose filter and injector blockages			0
it is also corrosive to some seals , plastics and metals ' and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure ' the @entity186 's own analysis , which assumed about half of corn residue would be removed from fields , found that fuel made from corn residue , also known as stover , would meet the standard in the energy law			1
that standard requires cellulosic biofuels to release 60 per cent less carbon pollution than gasoline			1
cellulosic biofuels that do n't meet that threshold could be almost impossible to make and sell			1
refiners would shun the fuels because they would n't meet their legal obligation to use minimum amounts of next - generation biofuels			1
the study claims biofuels made with corn residue ( right ) release 7 per cent more greenhouse gases when burned compared to petrol ( left ) @entity186 spokeswoman @entity211 said in a statement that the study ‘ does not provide useful information relevant to the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from corn stover ethanol			1
’ but an @entity218 investigation last year found that the @entity186 's analysis of corn - based ethanol failed to predict the environmental consequences accurately			0
the departments of @entity223 in the @entity12 have initiated programmes with farmers to make sure residue is harvested sustainably			0
for instance , farmers will not receive any federal assistance for conservation programs if too much corn residue is removed			0
a peer - reviewed study performed at the @entity234 's @entity233 in 2012 found that biofuels made with corn residue were 95 per cent better than gasoline in greenhouse gas emissions			1
that study assumed some of the residue harvested would replace power produced from coal , reducing greenhouse gas emissions , but it 's unclear whether future biorefineries would do that			1
professor @entity104 agrees that using some of the residue to make electricity , or planting cover crops , would reduce carbon emissions			0
but he did not include those in his computer simulation			0
still , corn residue is likely to be a big source early on for cellulosic biofuels , which have struggled to reach commercial scale			0
last year , for the fifth time , the @entity186 proposed reducing the amount required by law			0
it set a target of 17 million gallons for 2014			0
the law envisioned 1.75 billion gallons being produced this year			0
‘ the study says it will be very hard to make a biofuel that has a better greenhouse gas impact than gasoline using corn residue , ’ which puts it in the same boat as corn - based ethanol , said @entity261 , a professor at the @entity262 who has done research on biofuels ' emissions from the farm to the tailpipe			1
professor @entity261 said it was the best study on the issue he has seen so far .			0

biofuel release 7 *%* more emissions compared to petrol in its early years
@entity28 study said while biofuels could be better in the long run , they wo n't meet a standard set to qualify as renewable fuel
study criticised for being too simplistic in analysis of carbon loss from soil
@entity58 said that the ethanol it will produce there could be more than 100 per cent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions
