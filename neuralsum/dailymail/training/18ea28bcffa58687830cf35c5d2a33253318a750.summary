by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 6 august 2013 wanted : police released this mugshot of @entity3 when he was wanted for questioning about an armed robbery a criminal who was hauled to court to face robbery charges after a two - month manhunt has walked free after a judge ruled the ' wanted ' picture of him issued by police had contaminated evidence			1
detectives had released a mugshot of career criminal @entity3 , 32 , when he was wanting for questioning over a £ 20,000 robbery at an @entity19 supermarket			1
but witnesses due to testify against him at his trial told police they recognised his face after seeing the wanted picture - despite all the robbers wearing balaclavas during the raid			1
on the first day of the planned trial , prosecutors said there was ' huge potential for contamination ' in the evidence against him			1
apart from the eyewitnesses , whose identification of @entity3 was ' contaminated ' , the only other evidence was that his dna was found on a distinctive jacket linked to the robbery			1
but prosecutors said there was no evidence that @entity3 was wearing the jacket at the time of the attack , and he could have worn it previously			1
@entity50 , prosecuting told @entity51 that he would offer no evidence against @entity3 , adding : ' suspicion is n't enough			1
' @entity3 , who had previously been jailed for six years for conspiracy to rob , was suspected of being one of four men armed with a sledgehammer and handgun who had attacked security guards filling atm machines at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			1
one of the guards was punched twice in the face during the raid in 2011 , while another heard one of the robbers shout ' just shoot him '			2
the thieves made off with a cash box containing £ 20,000			1
suspects @entity74 , 33 , and @entity75 , 34 , were arrested but @entity3 fled to @entity76 in december 2011			1
the following july he called police from @entity78 in @entity79 to say he wanted to give himself up			2
arrangements were made for him to board an aircraft to @entity64 because officers were legally unable to go to @entity83 to escort him back to @entity84			0
@entity3 agreed to be arrested by officers when he arrived at @entity86 but when he touched down at @entity87 from his @entity89 flight he fled before he got to passport control			1
suspected : @entity3 ( left ) was found not guilty because the evidence against him was ' contaminated '			1
his friend @entity74 ( right ) was jailed for nine and a half years after admitting robbery while officers were waiting in @entity87 , he forced his way through a locked door into @entity97 and disappeared into the crowd before escaping in a taxi			2
it was then that police issued his mugshot in a wanted appeal			1
they failed to track him down until nearly two months later , when he arrived at @entity105 with a bullet wound to his chest			0
@entity3 staggered from the passenger seat of a @entity109 , which drove away as he was helped by paramedics outside the hospital on august 26 last year			1
it is not known who shot him , why or where			0
speaking at court , prosecutor mr @entity50 said : ' firstly , the main priority for everybody concerned is that they had to save his life			0
it was n’t until later in the year that he was arrested			0
' on november 12 last year he was arrested , answering “ no comment ” to questions			0
the only evidence in the robbery case centred around a very distinctive jacket that had his dna on the collar			1
' initially the offenders were described as having their faces covered by balaclavas and the victims said they could n’t identify the men due to this			0
' but about a month before @entity3 was arrested , the victims said they had seen articles in the press and recognised him , despite the fact he wore a face covering			2
' there is huge potential for contamination			0
many articles said he was the man responsible for the robbery and then the victims gave a statement saying they recognised his face only after his picture had been released			2
attack : four men armed with a sledgehammer and handgun carried out a £ 20,000 raid at @entity153 at @entity62 , in @entity63 ' aside from this identification , the only evidence is his dna on the collar of the jacket			1
there is no doubt the offender wore that jacket			0
however our expert confirms that it is not possible to tell when that was			0
' mr @entity50 said @entity3 was an acquaintance of those convicted of the robbery and said he went to the gym with @entity74 , so it was not possible to confirm when he had worn the jacket			1
that meant the only evidence was witnesses ' identification of @entity3 , which was ' contaminated			1
’ mr @entity50 added : ' the prosecution are n’t confident relying on the evidence			2
there is an overwhelming likelihood that the identification is contaminated			2
' his dna is bound to be on the getaway car as he goes to the gym with the other offender			0
he said he has been in the car plenty of times and he has worn that jacket and it is likely that he has			0
' but can we say he was the last person to wear it ? no , we ca n’t			0
for that reason , i offer no evidence			2
suspicion is n’t enough , your honour			0
' @entity3 's family smiled and gave the thumbs up as he was found not guilty by the judge			2
judge @entity200 said : ' i do n’t know enough about the case			0
it ’s not for me as a judge to intervene or make any further comment			0
' if there is not sufficient evidence to go before a jury , it would be wrong for that to now take place			0
' defending @entity3 , @entity213 said : ' it comes as no surprise that the prosecution have taken this view			2
' @entity75 , of @entity218 , was jailed for nine and a half years in august last year after pleading guilty to robbery			0
@entity74 , also of @entity218 , was jailed for six years , eight months .			0

@entity3 , 32 , faced robbery charges over £ 20,000 @entity223 raid
but prosecutors presented no evidence saying police mugshot had ' contaminated identification by witnesses '
