by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:27 est , 28 february 2014 after the implosion at the @entity6 ended the chaotic reign of @entity8 , @entity4 ’s target was @entity10 survival			1
as hope has replaced resignation with improved performances , a new and welcome objective has appeared which may bring the club ’s first major trophy since their famous @entity18 victory in 1973			1
five months ago , when @entity20 took over as head coach , cup competitions were a distraction			1
video : scroll down to see @entity20 speak on selection issues for the @entity26 final bringing the fun factor back : @entity4 boss @entity20 watches his team during training ahead of sunday 's @entity26 final against @entity30 lifting the gloom : @entity20 took over with @entity4 in disarray but has taken them to the @entity34 final and given the @entity4 hope they can stay in the @entity10 silverware : @entity4 's @entity35 lifts the @entity18 in 1973 after the @entity4 beat @entity36 1 - 0 - the last time the club won a major trophy when his side face @entity30 in the @entity26 final on sunday he is acutely aware of what a triumph against the odds will mean to the club and their success - starved fans			1
@entity20 knew that his first job when he was appointed in october was to build bridges after the @entity8 regime had managed to create so many chasms			1
the @entity50 became the first @entity4 manager for more than a decade actually to live in the city			1
he is constantly out and about and meeting the fans			2
happy in their work again : @entity20 , right , shares a joke with his players during @entity4 training emotions : there was never a dull moment on the touchline when @entity8 was in charge of @entity4 at the club , he made it a priority to rebuild the links between the playing and backroom staff			1
he knows the name of every cleaner , chef and office worker			2
he shakes their hands , gives hugs , high fives and smiles			2
he was the same at @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity20 quickly set about unpicking some of the more troublesome @entity8 diktats			1
for instance , the @entity83 ordered his players to eat in specific groups but the only meal @entity20 wanted his players to attend , with their partners , was in their first full week together			1
what happened in the @entity4 restaurant called @entity90 stayed in @entity91 but a decision was reached never to mention you - know - who again			1
and it ’s the one name you will not hear uttered by the players this weekend			2
@entity99 stint : @entity20 was manager of @entity100 side @entity81 before he joined @entity4 capital gain : @entity20 , seen here sharing a joke with @entity104 boss @entity103 in 2008 , spent time as assistant coach at @entity80 @entity106 , one of a handful not on international duty , remembers @entity20 ’s first day			1
‘ i was looking forward to his company , ’ the midfielder said			0
‘ there was relief in the dressing room			0
‘ i remember playing against his @entity81 team and we did n’t touch the ball for the first 20 minutes			2
‘ i knew that was the sort of manager he was and it was n’t a style of football i ’d been involved with before so i was looking forward to it			0
‘ @entity20 is very detailed in what he does			1
he looks for things and angles you might not have thought of			0
he ’s serious when he needs to be but calm at other times and relaxed when he wants to be			2
‘ he brings a spirit and camaraderie into the squad and it ’s a good mix. his staff are the same as well			0
he has got an angry side and rightly so at times			0
there have been times we ’ve not played well and he lets us know about it			0
‘ when he first came in everyone wanted to impress and he just said “ relax ”			0
he did n’t try to come in and change everything but he tried to change things slowly			0
’ fan of the current boss : @entity4 midfielder @entity106 , seen here challenging @entity104 's @entity144 , likes the style of play @entity20 wants the team to adopt the drills emphasise passing , the training - ground matches encourage passing , even shooting practice is based on passing			1
there are smiles and laughter in the sessions , but a hardworking environment			0
and , when @entity20 wants a word , he takes the player for a little walk and a chat round the pitches			2
there is no shouting and screaming and no former pro in his forties , showing off his torso , or how it should be done			0
players are treated like adults again			2
while @entity20 ’s influence has been remarkable , he would be the first to praise the initial work done by @entity173 coach and former captain @entity174 , who was called on by owner @entity175 to step in after @entity8 departed with just one point from the first five league games			1
caretaker : @entity4 initially turned to @entity174 when @entity8 was sacked it was @entity174 ’s job to repair the damage , install a more realistic code of conduct and restore some belief , fitness , confidence and even enjoyment on the training ground			1
ball ’s team , with @entity191 at the heart of midfield , beat @entity194 2 - 0 in the second round of the @entity26			1
it followed the 4 - 2 first - round win over @entity198 , notable for a @entity200 goal and being @entity8 ’s only victory in six before he was sacked			2
sensing this was his opportunity to stake a claim to manage a club close to his heart , @entity174 approached the job as if it was his already			0
@entity191 , like @entity208 , was ostracised by @entity8 and while their recall and welcome back into the first - team dressing room was an obvious decision , it was still a significant one			1
recalled : @entity20 brought back @entity208 , left , and @entity191 into the first - team dressing room ball , who was in the last @entity4 team to reach a @entity217 final in 1992 , said at the time : ‘ the players are professional and know we ’re disciplined and work hard and wo n’t tolerate things we feel are unacceptable , so there ’s not a great deal of change			1
they ’re all going to be treated as individuals and as men			0
’ @entity20 had watched every @entity4 game after @entity8 ’s departure			1
he saw a change in body language and commitment and was impressed by @entity174 ’s obvious influence			0
his first meeting after being appointed was with his under 21 coach			0
@entity174 ’s disciplinary changes merely needed tweaking , leaving @entity20 , coaches @entity235 , @entity237 , goalkeeping coach @entity238 and fitness coach @entity239 to concentrate on making a real difference on the training ground			2
happy times are back : @entity20 and his coaching staff celebrate @entity4 's third goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity246 one player who has benefited from @entity20 ’s calm hands - on approach is @entity250 , now back in the form of his life and on the fringe of the @entity255 squad			1
‘ it was just like having a chat with one of my friends talking about football , ’ the winger said			0
‘ that ’s the type of guy he is			0
that ’s why we ’re benefiting			0
‘ it was more just having a chat with me to see how i was			0
i do n’t think it was really , “ you ’ve got to do this , you ’ve got to do that ”			0
he just wanted me to play with freedom and confidence			0
fans at every club i ’ve been at have loved me			2
it ’s more the managers having the trust in me playing			0
back on form : @entity4 winger @entity250 has flourished under the guidance of @entity20 and on the fringe of the @entity255 squad big scalp : @entity250 and @entity4 team - mate @entity284 celebrate after beating @entity285 on penalties to reach the @entity26 final ‘ i just wanted to play and have a manager who had trust in me			1
the gaffer came in , tweaked the way we ’re playing so i get the ball a bit more and it seems to work			0
’ the major achievement of @entity20 ’s reign at @entity4 was the dramatic penalty shootout victory over @entity285 in the semi-finals			1
triumph over @entity30 on sunday would elevate @entity20 to the same status as @entity301 — and end the club ’s 41 years of hurt .			1

@entity20 has been a *breath* of fresh air after @entity8 's reign
@entity4 stand on brink of first major trophy since 1973
@entity30 their *opponents* in sunday 's @entity26 final
@entity20 had built bridges with the team and its fans
players never mention @entity8 's name
relaxed approach of boss is paying off with improved results
players have *responded* to his *methods*
