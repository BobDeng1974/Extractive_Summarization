@entity0 ended their pre-season tour of @entity2 with a 0 - 0 draw against @entity4 in @entity5			1
the @entity0 recovered from their narrow defeat to @entity7 last time out as they avoided a similar result against @entity4 , however in truth it was a dull affair with few chances of note			2
the @entity14 side were very unfortunate not to receive a penalty in the second period after @entity17 appeared to be taken down in the box , but his protests were waved away			1
find a way : @entity21 tries to find a way past the @entity4 defence applause : @entity24 applauds the travelling @entity0 faithful in @entity2 @entity0 : @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity21 ( @entity33 76 ) , @entity17 , @entity34 , @entity24 ( @entity35 59 )			2
@entity4 : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			0
the former @entity52 winger also went closest to breaking the deadlock when his long - range effort went just wide of goal			0
after a quiet opening it was the home side who showed the first signs of threatening to break the deadlock , having the ball in the net as early as the 12th minute through @entity40 - but the goal was correctly ruled out for offside			0
just minutes later the hosts were again unfortunate not to take the lead when @entity67 ' effort was brilliantly blocked by @entity26 at point blank range			0
the visitors stepped up their game slightly in the second half , with @entity17 's long - range strike inches away from giving the @entity0 the lead			1
@entity75 's side ended their three - match tour with a win , defeat and a draw , scoring one goal in the process			1
@entity0 face friendlies against @entity83 and @entity84 before their season opener away at @entity86 in a fortnight .			2

@entity75 's side managed a draw at the @entity91
@entity0 had *previously* drawn and won in their first two tour games
the @entity0 were unfortunate not to get a penalty in the second half when @entity17 was taken down in the box
