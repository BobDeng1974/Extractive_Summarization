by @entity0 with the ability to fly at 630mph while making barely a whisper of noise , this poor bird never stood a chance			2
this is the moment a buzzard was hit and killed by a @entity10 @entity9 b - 2 stealth bomber as it quietly landed at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
photographer @entity14 was taking pictures of the aircraft with friends but did not realise the bird strike happened until he examined his pictures the next day			1
clear of danger : the bird seemed to be a safe distance from the @entity24 as it flew away from its wing final moments : but quickly the bird was in trouble and can be seen here on the left hand side of the picture already under its fuselage pictured : the moment a buzzard was hit by a @entity9 @entity24 at @entity11 near @entity12 and disappeared in a puff of feathers ' i could n’t believe it at first ' he said			2
' the @entity24 has n’t been in the @entity38 for five years and to get a glimpse of it landing is a sight itself for plane - spotters , but to actually witness the moment a bird hits it is truly extraordinary ' he added			2
the bird , believed to be a buzzard based on the pattern on its wings , is seen in the distance at first			0
the next image shows how it glides the the right of the $ 737million aircraft			0
but the bomber is quickly behind it and then the buzzard was sucked into the engines followed by a puff of feathers			0
graceful : photographer @entity14 did not notice the bird strike until he inspected the pictures the following day graceful : the bomber continued its landing and touched down at a @entity65 base in @entity13 undamaged expensive : the @entity24 cost $ 737million each but with engine3rring and testing they cost well in excess of $ 1billion mr @entity14 , of @entity70 , said : ' military aircraft can not sustain birds in their engines as well as conventional ones			1
' they usually have less engines , one or two and can have a serious effect when the plane loses one ” he said ' it did n’t seem to have suffered any damage , as it took off again later on in the day ' he added			0
the @entity9 b - 2 stealth bomber cost $ 737million each to build but $ 2.1b in 1997 usd including development , engineering and testing			1
