@entity1 's @entity0 has spotted a huge eruption of dust around a young star			1
they believe the dust cloud was the result of a smashup between large asteroids			2
this type of collision can eventually lead to the formation of planets , researchers say			0
the aftermath of a large asteroid impact around @entity17 - @entity18 , a 35 - million - year - old sun - like star			1
@entity1 's @entity0 witnessed a giant surge in dust around the star , the result of two asteroids colliding			1
the viewing offers a glimpse into the violent process of making rocky planets like ours			1
rocky planets begin life as dusty material circling around young stars			1
the material clumps together to form asteroids that ram into each other			0
although the asteroids often are destroyed , some grow over time and transform into proto - planets			1
after about 100 million years , the objects mature into full - grown , terrestrial planets			2
our moon is thought to have formed from a giant impact between proto - earth and a @entity48 - size object			0
scientists had been regularly tracking the star , called @entity17 - @entity18 , when it surged with a huge amount of fresh dust between august 2012 and january 2013			1
' we think two big asteroids crashed into each other , creating a huge cloud of grains the size of very fine sand , which are now smashing themselves into smithereens and slowly leaking away from the star , ' said lead author and graduate student @entity63 of the @entity64 , @entity65			1
while dusty aftermaths of suspected asteroid collisions have been observed by @entity69 before , this is the first time scientists have collected data before and after a planetary system smashup			0

in the new study , @entity69 set its heat - seeking infrared eyes on the dusty star @entity99 , which is about 35 million years old and lies 1,200 light - years away in the @entity101 constellation			2
previous observations had already recorded variations in the amount of dust around the star , hinting at possible ongoing asteroid collisions			2
astronomers were surprised to see these data from @entity1 's @entity0 in january 2013 , showing a huge eruption of dust around a star called @entity17 - @entity18			1
in this plot , infrared brightness is represented on the vertical axis , and time on the horizontal axis			0
in hope of witnessing an even larger impact , which is a key step in the birth of a terrestrial planet , the astronomers turned to @entity69 to observe the star regularly			2
beginning in may 2012 , the telescope began watching the star , sometimes daily			2
a dramatic change in the star came during a time when @entity69 had to point away from @entity17 - @entity18 because our sun was in the way			1
when @entity69 started observing the star again five months later , the team was shocked by the data they received			0
' we not only witnessed what appears to be the wreckage of a huge smashup , but have been able to track how it is changing -- the signal is fading as the cloud destroys itself by grinding its grains down so they escape from the star , ' said @entity145 of the @entity64 and co-author on the study			0
' @entity69 is the best telescope for monitoring stars regularly and precisely for small changes in infrared light over months and even years			0
' a very thick cloud of dusty debris now orbits the star in the zone where rocky planets form			1
the viewing offers a glimpse into the violent process of making rocky planets like ours			1
our moon is thought to have formed from a giant impact between proto - earth and a @entity48 - size object			0
as the scientists observe the star system , the infrared signal from this cloud varies based on what is visible from @entity165			1
for example , when the elongated cloud is facing us , more of its surface area is exposed and the signal is greater			0
when the head or the tail of the cloud is in view , less infrared light is observed			0
by studying the infrared oscillations , the team is gathering first - of - its - kind data on the detailed process and outcome of collisions that create rocky planets like @entity165			1
' we are watching rocky planet formation happen right in front of us , ' said @entity190 , a @entity64 co-author of the new study			0
' this is a unique chance to study this process in near real - time			0
' the team is continuing to keep an eye on the star with @entity69			0
they will see how long the elevated dust levels persist , which will help them calculate how often such events happen around this and other stars , and they might see another smashup while @entity69 looks on .			0
