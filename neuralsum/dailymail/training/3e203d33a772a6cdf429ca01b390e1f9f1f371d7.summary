they are admired for their incredible ability to hover in mid-air and to beat their wings at up to 200 times a second			0
now , a new study has uncovered more if the hummingbird ’s secrets			1
researchers have discovered the migration patterns of hummingbirds and say they can live for just over a decade – up to five times as long as previously thought			1
researchers have discovered the migration patterns of hummingbirds and say they can live for just over a decade – up to five times as long as previously thought			1
here , a female black - chinned hummingbird is captured and tagged so that researchers will be able to learn more about here migration habits for the last decade , experts have been placing tiny numbered bands on the legs of birds , enabling researchers to identify a creature - and its vital statistics - when it is recaptured			1
the exercise has so far revealed astonishing migrations , with one rufous hummingbird tagged in @entity29 showing up six months later more than 3,500 miles ( 5,630km ) away in southeast @entity30			1
experts are not sure if the bird made the long trip in one go or if it stopped off along the way			1
some birds have even been discovered wintering in areas where temperatures drop below 18 ° c ( 0 ° f )			1
‘ we 're learning a lot about hummingbirds through banding we never would have learned otherwise , ’ said @entity39 , chief of the bird banding laboratory for the @entity42 's @entity41 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
since the 1990s , experts have been placing tiny numbered bands on the legs of birds to monitor them.the exercise has revealed astonishing migrations , with one rufous hummingbird tagged in @entity29 showing up six months later more than 3,500 miles ( 5,630km ) away in southeast @entity30			1
a @entity52 hummingbird is pictured bird banding or ringing is the process of attaching a small , individually numbered metal or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a wild bird			2
this enables the individual bird to be identified should it later be recaptured or recovered			2
it 's common to take measurements - such as fat content , age , sex , wing and tail - during the capture for ringing			0
the subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration , longevity , mortality , population studies , territoriality , feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists			1
it 's thought that the earliest attempt to mark a bird was made by @entity86 officers between 218 and @entity87 when they sent a crow by a besieged garrison			2
one of the soldiers tied a thread on the bird 's leg to send a reply			2
hummingbirds are protected in the @entity96 under the @entity97 and permits are need to capture them			1
they live in the @entity101 as far north as @entity30 and as far south as @entity102 and are known to migrate to the southern states , @entity104 and @entity105 for winter , with some birds based in warmer locations staying put instead			1
mr @entity39 said that there are 225 hummingbird banders in the @entity96 and around half of them are considered experts – a huge increase from around a dozen in the mid- 1990s			1
@entity115 , 68 , was among the early banders and caught 1,900 of the tiny creatures in @entity118 last summer			0
he said : ‘ they know exactly what 's going on			0
they know humans are supposed to put up the feeders			0
they consider us to be their personal servants			0
’ mr @entity115 flew fighter jets before retiring from the @entity126 in 1988 and finds hummingbird flight amazing			2
‘ i envy them greatly for being able to fly like that - how they can manoeuvre , from 0 to 50mph ( 0 to 80 kph ) about 10 feet ( three metres ) , ’ he said			2
@entity131 beat at about 70 times per second in normal fight and about 200 times per second during a high speed dive			0
the metal bands – which the banders prepare themselves – have become more advanced , as have traps and techniques used to collect the information gathered			0
some birds have even been discovered wintering in areas where temperatures drop below 18 ° c ( 0 ° f )			1
here , a make @entity52 hummingbird ( pictured left ) and a male black - chinned hummingbird ( right ) are studied hummingbirds are the only birds to hover in the air by relying on their strength alone			1
in august , scientists found that it is the ratio of the bird ’s wing length to its width that makes them so efficient			1
the discovery is helping experts compete with 42 million years of natural selection to build helicopters that are increasingly efficient , which could match the performance of the best hummingbird			1
@entity162 , an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at @entity164 in @entity165 , tested wings from 12 different species of hummingbirds , which he sourced from museums			2
he positioned them on a machine used to test the aerodynamics of helicopter blades - so they spun around like man - made blades			0
together with his team , he used cameras to capture airflow around the wings and measured the drag and the lift force they exerted at different speeds and angles			0
professor @entity162 ’s team used the same machine to test the rotor blades from a @entity189 autonomous micro helicopter , which is one of the most efficient on the market and is used by the @entity193 ’s army in @entity194			0
they found that the micro-helicopter 's blades are as efficient at hovering as the average hummingbird			2
but while the micro-copter 's blades kept pace with the middle - of - the - pack hummingbird wings , they could not keep up with the most efficient hummingbird 's wing			0
the wings of @entity205 - a species common throughout the @entity208 of the @entity96 – were found to be about 27 per cent more efficient than the man - made micro-copter blades			1
@entity211 , a research biologist with the @entity212 at @entity213 in @entity118 said : ‘ you need to have a standardised protocol			0
you just ca n't be willy - nilly			0
’ her group last year caught a record 635 hummingbirds , including 105 recaptures , during nine capture days between may and august on private property located about a mile ( 1.6km ) south of @entity220			2
key to capturing hummingbirds , she said , is to go where there is an established feeding site put up by humans that has had time to attract generations of hummingbirds			2
‘ they 'll bring their kids , and their baby hummingbirds will bring theirs the next year , ’ dr @entity211 said			2
‘ so you just get more and more every year			0
’ @entity234 , another hummingbird bander in @entity118 , captured a record 768 hummingbirds in the state			0
he 's discovered that a new species of hummingbird - the @entity205 - is starting to move into @entity118			0
‘ this year we caught two juveniles in august , the first documentation of juveniles in @entity118			0
’ his theory is that the species , which thrives in urban environments with human helpers , is moving from coastal areas to @entity118 expecting to find hummingbird feeders at the ready			0
while the information has shed light on hummingbird habits , it has also generated new questions			0
mr @entity39 said that it 's unclear whether hummingbirds on their long migrations fly hundreds of miles at a time and make long layovers to refuel , or if they are making relatively short 30 - mile ( 48km ) flights			1
the longevity of hummingbirds is also unknown , with mr @entity39 predicting birds in their teens will likely start showing as the banding program continues			1
banders in @entity118 are at a loss to explain why record numbers of hummingbirds were captured last summer			0
dr @entity211 believes that reasons may include a good breeding year to better migrating conditions , but researchers can only speculate			0
‘ our knowledge has increased and made us realise how little we know and how much there still is to learn about hummingbirds , ’ mr @entity39 said .			1

ornithologists in the @entity96 say hummingbirds can live longer than 10 years
they have been tagging the birds for a decade to study their habits
*experiment* has revealed that one bird flew 3,500 miles ( 5,630km ) for winter
hummingbirds have been found wintering in relatively cool areas below 18 ° c
thousands of birds have been ' banded ' and experts hope to learn about whether they migrate in one go , or stop off along the way
