warzone : some 250 bullets were fired , four pipe bombs thrown and a home - made pressure - cooker detonated in a confrontation that would leave one of the bombers dead and the street in ruins the bombers : @entity10 and @entity11 had just murdered three people and wounded 264 at the @entity13 when officer @entity14 spotted their black @entity15 driving along @entity16 in @entity17 ' as i drove by , i made eye contact with @entity10 … we both kind of looked at each other , ' he told the @entity41			1
' @entity10 got out and started walking toward me			1
he lifted up his arms and started firing at me			0
' bullets whistling past him , officer @entity14 dived behind his patrol car and returned fire , desperately hoping back up would soon arrive			1
a minute later , sgt @entity47 came on the scene , thinking he was responding to a routine carjacking			0
but as shots rang out , he pulled up near his colleague and reached for his gun			0
' i saw that [ @entity10 ] went from @entity14 ’ car to my car and shot , boom , right through the windshield , ' he said			2
' i got sprayed with glass as i was putting it in park			0
i said , ‘ @entity62 s * * t , they ’re shooting at us			0
' @entity64 : at one point , the elder brother then threw his first pipe bomb , which exploded yards from the two officers who dived for cover behind a car , the other side of which was shredded by shrapnel so in a bid to create a diversion while they held out for more officers , sgt. @entity47 put his car into neutral , leapt out and sent it rolling towards the brothers			1
' i needed to create some sort of diversion … they were engaging the vehicle and it was totally empty			0
' the elder brother then threw his first pipe bomb , which exploded yards from the two officers who dived for cover behind a car , the other side of which was shredded by shrapnel			1
then another pipe bomb , which bounced into the road and failed to detonate			2
heroic : the officers have been hailed as heroes for putting their lives on the line to protect the residents of @entity17 as @entity14 radioed for backup , the brothers threw a third pipe bomb which also turned out to be a dud			1
finally , officer @entity103 , officer @entity104 , and sgt. @entity105 , 57 , a married father of two with 33 years on the force , arrived to join in the fight			2
as they shouted at the brothers , telling them they were surrounded , @entity10 threw another pipe bomb which ravaged three cars , narrowly missing its cowering targets			1
caught : @entity11 , 19 , is searched by law enforcement officers			1
he had already fled the scene of the gunfight , running over his brother with a stolen suv officer @entity118 , a 25 year old with only four months on the job , pulled up next , to be met with an almighty blast			2
' just as i 'm looking up to see what 's going on , the big pressure cooker went off , ' he recalled			1
' that was a very loud bang , and a big glow that lit up the entire night			0
' i felt like someone dropped a bunch of stones on my head , and it ended up being the shrapnel from the explosion , falling down from the sky			1
' but by now the officers outnumbered the bombers and were gaining the upper hand			0
sgt. @entity105 , meanwhile , had snuck through a back garden in a bid to surprise the brothers from behind			0
he saw their feet from under a car and tried shooting their ankles			0
but @entity10 spotted him before he could fire a clean shot			2
in an apparent last stand , @entity10 is reported to have shouted : ' you want more ? i give you more			2
' he rushed at @entity150 , gun blazing			0
but then his weapon jammed so he threw it at the officer , striking him in the bicep , and fled			0
quick - thinking @entity105 chased and tackled him to the ground			0
but at that moment he was blinded by the lights of the black suv			0
he looked up to see @entity11 was now behind the wheel , revving the engine			2
@entity11 hit the accelerator and sped towards the tussling pair in the apparent hope of freeing his brother from @entity150 's hold			2
pandemonium : three people died and 264 were wounded when the brothers detonated two home - made devices near the finish line of the @entity13 but @entity105 leapt out of the way			1
@entity11 ran over his brother , dragging him 25 yards along the street			2
he then sped off into the night , leaving his brother , who by now had been shot nine times , to his fate			0
the relieved officers cuffed @entity10 , who was groaning in pain and read him his rights			1
he died of his wounds hours later			0
@entity11 was later discovered wounded and hiding under the tarp of a boat in a local resident 's garden less than half a mile away			1
he was arrested and awaits trial for the atrocity .			0
