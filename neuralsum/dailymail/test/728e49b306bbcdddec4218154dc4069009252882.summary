@entity2 's @entity1 victory over city rivals @entity4 on wednesday night marked the eighth match @entity6 has not started this season ... and @entity2 have won every single one			1
the @entity8 has received some criticism from sections of the @entity12 support despite a bright start in @entity2 , and these remarkable stats will do nothing to help his popularity at the club			2
the £ 86million man has missed out on just eight starts in @entity2 's 50 matches this term , but his team - mates have picked up a 100 per cent win record when he has been away , scoring 25 and conceding just one goal			1
@entity6 has not started eight of @entity2 's matches this season , through injury and omission his latest injury , suffered against @entity31 , meant he missed wednesday night 's @entity1 game @entity6 's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against @entity39 , two @entity1 ties with @entity35 ( in which he entered the fray as a 62nd - minute substitute at the @entity12 ) , and wednesday night 's @entity43 quarter - final against @entity4 ... but it seems the rest of the @entity2 squad are just fine without him			1
in the first half of the season , @entity6 suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with @entity54 , and he missed @entity55 matches against @entity56 ( 5 - 0 win ) , @entity39 ( 3 - 1 win ) , @entity47 ( 4 - 0 win ) and a 3 - 0 @entity1 victory against @entity35			2
he was in contention for the return leg against @entity35 at the @entity12 , but did not start the match , instead coming on as a second - half substitute			0
real were 1 - 0 up when he came on , and the score remained the same until the final whistle			0
in december , @entity2 were already leading 4 - 1 against third - tier side @entity64 in their @entity65 tie heading into the second leg , and @entity67 opted to rest some of his biggest names			0
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity6 were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as @entity2 recorded a comfortable 5 - 0 win			2
that 's six games without @entity6 in the starting line - up , and six wins for @entity2			2
moving into 2015 , @entity6 played a major role in the team 's start to the year , scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against @entity86 and his omission against @entity88 on april 11			0
@entity6 was sidelined for @entity2 's 3 - 1 win over @entity39 , in which @entity69 scored a penalty @entity70 scored in a 3 - 0 win against @entity35 at @entity92 in october ... @entity6 was injured for the game @entity67 stated in the build - up to the match that he had decided to rest the @entity8 , while the team went on to win 3 - 0 against their struggling opposition			1
@entity6 again returned the side for two matches , a goalless draw against @entity4 in the @entity1 and a win against @entity31 in @entity55 , but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash			0
instead of taking to the field in the crucial @entity43 match on wednesday night , @entity6 was resigned to watching the match from home , where he tweeted his support of the team			0
@entity112 's goal against @entity4 ensured real have won all of their eight matches without @entity6 the @entity8 took to @entity116 on wednesday to wish @entity2 good luck against city rivals @entity4 @entity112 's late goal ensured another victory for @entity67 's men , taking their bale-less record to eight wins , no draws and no losses			1
with the @entity8 , @entity2 have a 69 per cent win record , far from disastrous , recording 29 wins , four draws and nine losses			1
but the stats without him will surely give ammunition to those unhappy with their £ 86million man .			0

in the games he has missed , @entity2 *boast* a 100 per cent win record
@entity2 have scored 25 goals and conceded just one without the @entity8
