@entity0 was in town as the event kicked off after @entity4 and @entity5 , it 's @entity6 's turn to have a say as to how women will dress for the spring - summer 2013			1
if the first day of previews was any indication , next summer will feature a lot of bold colour and patterns			1
while the more structured , usually daytime , looks were in heavier fabrics , evening or playtime came in airier , diaphanous materials like chiffon and tulle			1
' sophisticated and essential ' : @entity23 's @entity22 collection featured bold shades romantic looks : some of the delicate prints were reminiscent of @entity28 floral wallpaper and the bell sleeves of a simple cocktail sheath ( left ) underlined the couture feel of the collection @entity6 designers are offering more romantic looks rather than their trademark slinky and sexy			1
long and loose pants were paired with ample tunic tops while voluminous long skirts offered a nice sweep			1
the accessories - high - heels and bags alike - often replicated patterns in the outfits			1
hair styles were long and simple , either tucked up in a chignon or behind the ears			1
over the next six days , more than 60 of @entity49 's top designers , including @entity23 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 will present their take on next summer 's well - dressed woman			1
‘ sophisticated and essential ’ is how @entity23 designer @entity58 described the elegant collection that kicked off @entity60			1
dreamy : models walk the runway during the @entity65 catwalk show based on a simple elongated silhouette with artful cutouts and decorative flounces , accessorised by skinny high - heeled cage sandals and oversized 1970s costume jewellery , the collection came in bold shades of fuchsia , coral , kiwi green , mustard yellow and electric blue			1
total black or total white underlined the couture feel of the collection , as did the delicate prints reminiscent of @entity28 floral wallpaper , penthouse pyjama pants or the bell sleeves of a simple cocktail sheath			2
but @entity58 is very much a contemporary designer , and her couture came with an edge			2
this is seen in the sophisticated ankle straps of the sandals decorated with the logo horse bit , the plexiglass clutch bag and the snakeskin patterns for evening wear			2
next up was @entity96 , and the diaphanous , dainty and above all delicious collection for the spring - summer 2013 is sure to be a hit wherever sophisticated maidens gather , from beach clubs to garden parties to summer weddings			2
while a mega-screen projected silently moving water , model after model came down the runway wearing gowns so light they looked like a second skin			2
@entity111 and dainty : the @entity96 catwalk show featured beautiful gowns of various colours , from pearly white to sea green and @entity117 blue with their hair gelled back as if they had just come out of the water and many gowns ending in a delicate train , the models looked like a parade of beautiful mermaids			2
the colours of the gowns ranged from pearly white to sea green and @entity117 blue			0
sometimes the light fabric was adorned with shimmering sequins , at others it came in dainty lace			0
sheer nude tulle , which allowed the skin to shine through , held the gowns together , creating the mermaid effect			0
the overall look was young , demure and very special with every outfit unique			0
when asked what inspired the dreamy light look , the @entity49 designer said she felt the need to ' make up for the heavy moment we are all going through			0
' meanwhile @entity65 dug into the archives for 1970s graphic prints for next year 's warm weather looks			0
bold : @entity65 's collection included vibrant pink colours jetting in : supermodel @entity0 attended an event at the @entity150 , in @entity6 on wednesday the collection at @entity60 featured zigzag , confetti or gum - wrapper prints in dreamy pastels or more vibrant pinks , sea - foam green or gold			1
many of the daytime looks were two pieces , allowing for endless combinations and coverage			0
cropped tops were shown over belted short skirts that flair , long - sleeved tunic tops were over super-wide trousers for an elegant , all - covered feel			0
designer @entity170 played with volume , accenting short skirts with a pair of inverted pleats on each hip for a bubble effect that contrasted with tighter fitting bodices , sometimes off the shoulder or with cap sleeves			0
and @entity180 turned the volume way up for evening wear , offering romantic flowing pleated or tiered skirts that swept along the floor			0
the evening colour palate was mostly pastels , a soft pink skirt with an ivory off - the - shoulder top , pulled together by a belt accented with crystals			0
