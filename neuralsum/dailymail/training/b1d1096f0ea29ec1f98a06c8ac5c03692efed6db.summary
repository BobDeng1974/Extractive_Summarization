in the retrial , the jurors will not see the $ 200,000 @entity30 ( pictured ) that @entity11 was driving at the time of the crash in the case , the new jury will not be shown the $ 200,000 @entity30 that @entity11 was driving when he allegedly ran a stop sign and smashed into mr @entity13 's car at speed , sending it into a canal			1
they will also not see the @entity40 that the engineering graduate was travelling in when he plummeted into the water and drowned , according to @entity43			2

' his car was a crucial piece of evidence in the first case , ' said @entity57 legal analyst @entity56			0
crumpled : they will also not see the @entity40 ( pictured ) that mr @entity13 , an engineering graduate , was travelling in when he was struck by @entity11 's vehicle			1
the student then plunged into a canal and drowned surveying the damage : this is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after @entity11 ( pictured with his damaged @entity30 ) was convicted in his first trial			1
the cars were to be crushed ' this is a much better case for the defense this time around			2
' earlier this week , @entity48 homicide detective @entity71 told the new jury that @entity11 appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the fatal crash			2

on trial : earlier this week , @entity48 homicide detective @entity71 told the new jury that @entity11 ( seen , left , in court ) appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the crash tragic : @entity11 said he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the @entity93 graduate ( pictured with his mother ) , who was driving home to @entity15 to visit his family at the time evidence presented in court showed that the mogul 's bill at the venue came to around $ 272			1
however , @entity11 's lawyers claimed that he was not driving while drunk , but instead had a drink following the incident to calm his nerves			0

at the time , @entity153 ' attorney , @entity152 , said @entity11 was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets			0
a @entity157 appeals court later ruled that the businessman could not adopt ms @entity141			0
@entity11 's appeal for a retrial was granted after juror @entity161 , 69 , was found guilty of misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife 's @entity6 during jury selection			1
couple : in march 2012 , @entity11 tried to adopt his girlfriend @entity141			0
above , the couple together lap of luxury : the @entity168 , which @entity11 founded , attracts a range of a-list celebrities ' a juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer 's worst nightmare , ' @entity11 's attorney @entity171 wrote in a statement at the time			1
