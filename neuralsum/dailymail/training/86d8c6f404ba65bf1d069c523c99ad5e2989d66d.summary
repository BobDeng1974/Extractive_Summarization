by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 21:12 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 1 august 2013 @entity4 director @entity3 jousted with a few hecklers as he defended the @entity8 spy agency 's surveillance programs at the @entity10 security conference on wednesday , but largely kept the crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers on his side			1
' read the @entity15 ! ' one heckler shouted at the 61 - year - old four - star general as he responded to polite but tough questions selected in advance by conference organizers			1
so should you , ' @entity3 shot back , triggering sustained applause			2
@entity3 has been under fire from many civil liberties advocates and lawmakers since former @entity4 contractor @entity45 leaked documents revealing previously secret telephone and internet surveillance programs run by the @entity8 government			1
@entity45 , facing @entity8 criminal charges and holed up in @entity52 , disclosed details on how the @entity4 gathers and stores telephone calling records of virtually all @entity8 , and works closely with @entity55 , @entity56 and other technology companies to obtain communications from users in other countries			2
the @entity4 is the @entity8 spy agency that monitors foreign electronic communications			2
the @entity4 protects some of the companies represented at the conference and hires some of their best employees			1
at the same time , many security experts have profound enthusiasm for the causes of internet freedom and privacy			2
hecklers : @entity3 was heckled by protesters during wednesday 's conference @entity3 's comments in @entity34 did not go beyond those he previously gave before @entity76 and at other public appearances in the past two months			1
he argued that the @entity4 surveillance programs helped disrupt more than 50 " terrorist - related " plots but said he supported wider discussions on how to balance national security priorities with privacy rights			2
@entity3 , who is also in charge of the @entity84 that handles military cyberspace operations , said the @entity4 initially examined only several hundred phone numbers , then looked outward to see who else those people had spoken to			1
his tone was mostly conciliatory , though he asserted that allegations of indiscriminate eavesdropping by the @entity4 had not been borne out by a @entity93 committee investigation , internal audits or reviews by administration officials			2
' we get all these allegations of what they could be doing , but when people check , like the intelligence committee , they found no times ' that @entity4 internet surveillance had been willfully abused , he said			0
overseas businesses the furor over the @entity4 surveillance programs threatens the overseas business of some @entity8 companies , as technology buyers look to local alternatives to replace @entity8 services that can be intercepted			0
leaks : former @entity4 contractor @entity45 is seeking asylum after leaking sensitive documents about the @entity4 's electronic surveillance programs the first question from the audience for @entity3 after his conference speech was whether he believes the @entity4 is hurting the ability of @entity8 technology companies to compete for foreign customers			1
he said that companies should be able to disclose how little they actually turn over , as the industry is asking to do			0
@entity3 also said the vast majority of countries have similar ' lawful intercept ' programs and the @entity4 's version was an unusually good model because it was subject to @entity8 court review , albeit in secret			1
though not as critical as @entity76 and the courts , the security professionals at @entity10 still represent a key audience for @entity3			1
' this is the greatest center of technical gravity in the world , ' he said of his audience			0
' it is important that we put the facts on the table			0
' @entity10 conferences bring together corporate , government and independent cybersecurity experts including some hackers			1
asylum : @entity52 president @entity149 has declined to hand @entity45 over the @entity8 officials because information on so many @entity8 is subject to collection without any suspicion of wrongdoing , @entity45 's revelations have provoked a large privacy outcry			0
' i 've never sensed this level of tension or apprehension in the community , ' said @entity10 founder @entity162			0
he recalled the debate over @entity8 restrictions on cryptography exports in the 1990s but said that " pales in comparison " to the fight about mass communications interception now underway			0
the @entity8 @entity169 voted last week not to cut funding for the @entity4 's calling - records program			0
the @entity8 government on wednesday released some declassified documents on the @entity4 's mass collection of telephone data			0
the documents included an april order by the @entity8 @entity178 that directed @entity179 to hand over data from millions of @entity8 ' telephone calls and described how the data should be stored and accessed .			0

hecklers told @entity4 director @entity3 to ' read the @entity15 '
@entity3 spoke at the @entity10 security conference in @entity34 , which *attracted* about 7,000 cybersecurity experts and hackers from the private and public sectors
