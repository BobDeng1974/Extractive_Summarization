but rooms in the @entity3 tend to be much smaller than in other countries			1
‘ all the evidence suggests that years of tight planning controls restricting house building has led to us having the smallest space per household in @entity5			2
’ the figures were compiled as part of a report which confronted some of the most widely - held views about the cost of living crisis			1
the @entity15 contests the claim that @entity3 has enough houses but too many people live in particular areas and should move to less populated parts of the country			1
instead , it said , house building simply has not kept up with the growing population			0
@entity3 live in the smallest homes in @entity5 , a report has revealed - pictured are six houses in @entity59 , south @entity60 that were sold for just £ 100 in 2009 the number of people in the @entity3 has risen by five million over the past 12 years and is growing faster than anywhere else in @entity5			1
last year , the number of people in the @entity3 rose by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time , according to figures from the @entity68			1
the @entity15 report said : ‘ throughout more than three decades , the @entity3 has been building fewer new homes than any other country in @entity5			1
‘ as a result , residential floor space per household is now the lowest in @entity5			1
this shows that the housing problem can not be solved through redistribution … for the simple reason that there is not a lot to redistribute			0
the housing stock is inadequate in total			0
there is no “ excess housing ” in any region , only different degrees of shortfall			0
’ the report also claimed that areas which were in the most desperate need for new homes , including @entity27 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , had a ‘ disproportionate share of greenbelt land and have particularly virulent anti-development campaigners ’			2
it added : ‘ paradoxically , the regions where demand is lowest account for a disproportionate share of the construction activity			0
’ the report came as a separate study by the @entity68 revealed that the number of houses built in the @entity3 fell from 378,000 in the financial year 1969/70 to just 141,000 in 2013/14			1

@entity135 , housing economist at @entity120 , said : ‘ there has been a significant increase in first - time buyers since 2010 compared with a modest decline in the number of those moving home			0
‘ this difference is reflected in a bigger rise in prices over the past five years for those property types that are most popular with first - time buyers – flats and terraces			0
’ first - time buyers accounted for almost a third of flat sales over the last decade , compared to just five per cent of sales for detached homes .			0
