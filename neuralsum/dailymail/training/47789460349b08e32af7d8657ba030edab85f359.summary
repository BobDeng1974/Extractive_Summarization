and what have you done ? in the case of @entity6 , and its damnable task force , they have done as expected			1
they have come up with a compromise that is n’t and a solution that was never going to be			0
everyone knew how this was going to pan out , but seeing the news in black and white makes it suddenly real			0
not just for fans , or armchair followers , but those who run football clubs , particularly those living from hand to mouth			0
@entity22 's @entity6 is set to ruin the @entity24 tradition of @entity1 football during the 2022 - 23 season fans could be deprived of memorable games like @entity28 ’ 5 - 3 defeat of @entity30 on @entity31 it is not just the elite programme of fixtures that has been surrendered to accommodate the @entity35 in @entity36			1
@entity38 clubs will have to plan without the @entity1 and @entity40 schedule in 2022 , too			1
revenue streams will be disrupted , payment plans reorganised			0
you know the way your mortgage comes out after payday ? it works like that in football , too			0
clubs settle debts at times conducive to revenue			0
the holiday period is a good earner and comes just before the transfer window			0
not so perilous at @entity57 but potentially disastrous at @entity58			0
not that too many on a big , important @entity6 task force will be thinking about them			1
@entity63 chief executive @entity62 is among those on the @entity35 task force the @entity6 task force members , including @entity62 , in discussion on monday in @entity68 the task force , though , are picking up the pieces for the real culprits			1
@entity72 , the chairman of the @entity73 , had it right			1
‘ we would not be doing this if @entity6 had done their work properly , ’ he said			1
‘ this is something @entity6 brought on itself by not reading the report of the safety inspector			1
it tells you the technical assessment was not being used as the basis for the decision			2
’ tuesday ’s news goes to the very heart of @entity6 corruption			1
this would not be necessary if the @entity35 had not been awarded to @entity36 ; and the @entity35 would not have been awarded to @entity36 if — well , who knows why the @entity35 was awarded to @entity36 ? who knows why it is still there , considering recent revelations have linked the bid , and the hosts , to bribery and slave labour and established connections to some of the vilest men on the planet ? @entity36 's delegate party celebrate being awarded the @entity36 back in december 2010 who knows why it was ever there when @entity6 ’s technical inspection team may as well have stamped danger in big red letters across @entity36 ’s bid , due to the extreme summer heat ? the idea that the november - december @entity35 is the least worst solution only works if we abandon the idea of starting again			1
this is what should have happened the moment the @entity35 @entity6 voted for — taking place in a desert in 50 degrees — was deemed unworkable and treacherous			1
the tournament that replaces it is one that was never discussed and ruins domestic competitions that have been running for longer than @entity6 ’s jamboree , and with greater integrity			2
@entity72 said the @entity73 would try to preserve all the traditional @entity1 and @entity40 dates but that is a forlorn hope			1
with the @entity35 final slated for december 23 , it is unthinkable that @entity24 football could return before the @entity134 third round taking place the first weekend in january			2
even that may be too soon			0
@entity138 president @entity137 ( right ) will be relieved the @entity139 wo n't have to adjust in 2022 - 23 the announcement has been coming but , even so , @entity63 chief executive @entity62 looked genuinely shocked			1
maybe he truly thought disruption to the @entity24 calendar could be avoided			0
ultimately , just about every other event has been prioritised : the @entity144 , religious festivals , the @entity146 and the @entity139			0
@entity138 , to the surprise of few , ratted out the @entity149 leagues by pushing for dates that would least affect their prestige competition			2
they can rush through the @entity139 group stages early , break mid-winter as always , and reconvene with the @entity35 a memory			2
anything else would have been a huge embarrassment for president @entity137 , considering he voted for @entity36 in the first place			0
@entity161 bid chairman sheik mohammed bin @entity160 is all smiles ( left ) also on his soapbox was @entity164 of @entity165 and the @entity166 ( to put his responsibilities in his order of priority )			0
he was talking money — specifically compensation for the @entity149 clubs			0
as someone who received two free @entity174 watches worth £ 84,000 when the @entity166 held its annual assembly in @entity36 in 2013 — the @entity36 organising committee also picked up the £ 500,000 tab for the event — he will know the hosts are good for it			2
@entity1 has come early , it seems — although not in @entity58 .			2

@entity6 task force *recommend* 2022 @entity35 starts later in the year
decision expected to be *ratified* by @entity6 's executive committee next month
@entity62 says @entity63 are *disappointed* by the decision
@entity72 says @entity73 will try and *protect* annual @entity1 fixture schedule
decision will have knock on affect down the @entity38
