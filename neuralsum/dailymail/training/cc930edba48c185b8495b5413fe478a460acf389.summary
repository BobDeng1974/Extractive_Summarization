by @entity1 reporter published : 19:03 est , 1 december 2013 updated : 04:43 est , 2 december 2013 ministers are under pressure to bring in new anti-begging laws to cope with an anticipated invasion of aggressive street beggars from @entity7 and @entity8			1
they have been pressed by five local government chiefs and a police and crime commissioner for stricter laws so that intrusive hustlers can be arrested and kept off the streets			1
in a letter to home office minister @entity17 , they warned of ‘ professionalised , aggressive begging ’ which hovers ‘ inconveniently , or perhaps conveniently , between high - level anti-social behaviour and low - level criminality ’			1
five local government chiefs have written to the @entity22 asking for tough laws to tackle beggars ( file pic ) they want tougher clauses written into the government ’s @entity27 so that beggars face arrest if they repeatedly ignore a new order known as an injunction to @entity33 and @entity34			1
it is claimed the measure , which replaces @entity37 , ‘ will bark but wo n’t bite ’			2
immigrants would use an independent @entity40 as a ‘ barn door ’ to set up home in the rest of the @entity44 , a campaign group has warned			2
they would use a more ‘ liberal ’ migration policy north of the border to head south – and stopping them would mean border controls that could harm tourism and business travel , says @entity51			2
chairman sir @entity52 said the issue must be a ‘ red line ’ in negotiations if @entity40 vote ‘ yes ’ to independence in next september ’s referendum			0
‘ this would not just be a back - door to the rest of the @entity44 ; it would be a barn door , ’ he said			0
the letter was written following growing difficulties in some @entity63 boroughs with organised gangs of @entity67 migrants and was signed by leaders of councils in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
it was also backed by @entity76 and crime commissioner @entity77			0
@entity70 councillor @entity78 said : ‘ we are not concerned about working people from @entity7 and @entity8			0
we are worried about begging gangs coming here to get money			1
they will start in central @entity63 , then they will spread out to @entity71 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and other cities			0
they will go further afield			0
’ she added : ‘ as things stand , we wo n’t be able to arrest them			0
’ the letter has also won support from other local authorities			1
@entity96 , @entity97 leader of @entity98 in north @entity63 , said : ‘ the ripple effects of crime associated with new waves of @entity67 immigrants and rough sleeping are already creeping further out across @entity63			1
‘ they even targeted our @entity106 fair on saturday , where @entity107 was appearing			0
if @entity107 is in their sights it does n’t bode well for the rest of us			0
’ the concerns come amid increasing pressure on @entity114 over the lifting of @entity44 labour market restrictions on @entity7 and @entity8 in january			0
mr @entity17 said : ‘ we will listen to the views of local authorities regarding antisocial behaviour as we have done throughout the development of the @entity121			2
’ the move comes ahead of an expect influx of beggars from @entity7 and @entity8 next year			1
