by @entity0 published : 13:51 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 15 october 2012 @entity1 will bring home 4,000 troops from @entity3 next year under plans to speed up the pace of @entity1 withdrawal			2
defence secretary @entity7 revealed the mass pullout , the first senior minister to put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown			1
@entity13 has previously announced that @entity1 combat operations in @entity3 will be over by the end of 2014			1
@entity16 pullout : @entity1 soldiers from @entity18 , 2 @entity19 , board a @entity21 helicopter on an operation in @entity23 , @entity24 province but mr @entity7 said commanders have advised the government that @entity3 forces will be able to cope if nearly half of the @entity1 's 9,000 - strong force in @entity24 province pulls out next year			1
initial plans would have seen the vast bulk of @entity1 troops withdraw in 2014 , but commanders now consider that they can move faster in 2013			2
army chiefs have also come under pressure from chancellor @entity36 , who confronted commanders at a recent @entity38 meeting , demanding to know why they could n't pull all @entity1 troops out of @entity3 now			2
the @entity39 is keen to save money to help reduce the deficit and operations in @entity3 have already cost in excess of Â£ 17 billion on top of the core defence budget			1
@entity1 currently has 9,500 military personnel on the ground , a figure which will be cut to 9,000 by the end of this year			2
mr @entity7 said reductions next year would be dramatically bigger : ' following my last visit to @entity3 , i detect a change in mood among the senior @entity56 commanders , that it will now be possible to have a significant reduction in force numbers by the end of next year , after the next fighting season			1
defence secretary @entity7 revealed the mass pullout , the first senior minister to put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown welcome home : @entity67 @entity66 with his son @entity68 , aged four , as soldiers from @entity70 ( the @entity70 ) are reunited with their families after returning from @entity3 ' that is because of the evidence , this year , that as the @entity73 has withdrawn its surge , the @entity3 have in fact stepped up to the plate and taken over those positions			1
' i would expect it to be significant			2
which means thousands not hundreds but i would not expect it to be the majority of our forces			0
' asked , by the @entity86 's @entity85 whether that meant around 4,000 troops would be brought back , mr @entity7 nodded and said : ' something [ like that ]			1
' by the beginning of 2013 , we 'll have 9,000 troops there and by the end of 2014 we 'll have virtually none			1
i would expect there to be a significant step at the end of 2013			2
' the ability of the @entity3 forces to take on the @entity102 has been questioned as a result of a series of ' green on blue ' incidents which have seen @entity102 sympathisers infiltrate the local security forces and murder @entity1 soldiers			0
but mr @entity7 said the @entity111 has shown that it will be able to contain the @entity102 once @entity1 and @entity73 troops leave			1
' in two of the three districts that we , the @entity1 , are responsible for , in @entity116 and @entity117 , the @entity3 are doing all the day - to day security work already			0
' transition is well advanced in those areas			0
' our forces are mainly in the main operating bases , going out occasionally to support them			0
but by and large the @entity3 already , two years ahead are in control of security			0
' the defence secretary confirmed that the chancellor questioned whether troops could be withdrawn now , but he said mr @entity36 was simply being provocative			1
' the chancellor 's style is quite properly to challenge received wisdom , ' he said			0
' i think he was asking us to justify our current plan by putting it to us that there is an alternative , we could just come out now			0
and we take that challenge			0
' the @entity38 is expected to meet again in december to discuss options for the @entity3 force , with a decision likely before february			0
some 433 @entity1 service personnel have died in @entity3 since the 2001 operation that toppled the @entity102 .			0

@entity13 previously said operations will be over by the end of 2014
defence secretary @entity7 has now put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown
