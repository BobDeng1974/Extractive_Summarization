' mr @entity22 , the @entity1 minister for europe and @entity25 , last night said mr @entity4 's response was ' pitiful ' and challenged him to sack mr @entity0			1
mr @entity22 is now taking legal advice following the ' islamophobic ' slur , and will subsequently consider reporting the issue to the police			2

he claimed that mr @entity22 was supposed to appear on the programme , and said : ' @entity22 , or as i call him , @entity11 , did n't seem to turn up			1
' challenged by the @entity18 during the conversation , mr @entity0 said the remark was intended to be private			2
however , there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off - the - record			0
hook - handed @entity11 was earlier this year given a life sentence by a @entity57 judge for supporting terrorism			0
the hate cleric was convicted last may of multiple charges , including hostage - taking and plotting to set up a terror training camp in the @entity63			0
the @entity1 @entity18 telephoned @entity2 leader @entity4 yesterday to ask for his response to mr @entity0 's remark			1
he replied : ' i really have n't read them in full , to be honest with you , i 've been busy doing other things			0
' informed of what was said and told that mr @entity22 has called for disciplinary action against mr @entity0 for making an ' islamophobic ' comment , mr @entity4 replied : ' what , for telling a joke in poor taste ? ' he added : ' it looks to me like a joke			1
i have n't spoken to mr @entity0 at all , but i assume it 's a joke in poor taste			1
' pressed if he would suspend mr @entity79 , he said : ' no.			0
. come on , this is nonsense is n't it ? ' the bloke has made a joke in poor taste is my interpretation of it			1
i think one should make jokes in good taste , not jokes in poor taste			1
' asked again if he would take any action , mr @entity4 said : ' not right now			0
i have many other things on my plate , this is not top of my list			0
i do n't deal with party discipline , i 'm the political leader			0

' last night , mr @entity22 said : ' racism and @entity110 are no laughing matter			0
' this is a pitiful response from mr @entity4 - at best it shows he does n't have a clue of what 's going on in his own party and at worst it indicates he does n't see anything wrong in what mr @entity0 has said			1
' mr @entity0 is not fit for public life and must be sacked by his leader			2
' the @entity10 minister said he is seeking legal advice on whether the remark may have broken laws on racial and religious hatred			0
terror cleric @entity11 has been deported to the @entity63 he added : ' it has been heartening to see the opposition parties condemn mr @entity0 's comments - and i have also been overwhelmed by the many messages of support and encouragement i have received from people across the country			1
' first minister @entity97 said the slur was ' reprehensible '			0
@entity137 leader @entity136 said of the @entity100 : ' people across @entity1 , including even those who voted for him , will now want to see the back of him			2

@entity155 , president of @entity156 , said : ' @entity0 's unacceptable @entity110 has no place in a tolerant , diverse @entity1			1
' @entity158 have spent years rightly distinguishing the true teachings of @entity160 against the actions of terrorists			0
for an elected member to refer to @entity22 as a convicted extremist is beyond the pale			0
@entity0 's remarks have deeply insulted the entire @entity158 community in @entity1			1
' @entity168 , of @entity169 , said : ' @entity2 claim that they are not a racist party , therefore they must treat the racist language and behaviour of their members seriously			2

however , @entity2 's @entity1 chairman , @entity179 , claimed his colleague had made a ' slip of the tongue ' and ' got a name wrong '			2
he said : ' i very often get referred to as @entity185 , which i believe is a character from @entity188 , but i do n't take offence and run greeting to the papers about @entity191			0

in an email to mr @entity22 , headed @entity195 , he wrote : ' in reference to a private comment i made , reported to you by @entity199 , i am very sorry that i have offended you as i clearly have			2
