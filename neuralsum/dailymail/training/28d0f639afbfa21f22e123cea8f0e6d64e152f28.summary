@entity1 's hopes of unleashing @entity2 in the @entity3 appear to be slim after the @entity5 centre revealed that he is unlikely to be fit before the end of next month			1
initial medical reports suggested the 23 - year - old would be back in action by @entity11 after suffering a groin injury in october , but his recovery has been hit by several setbacks and he could now miss the @entity15 against @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity19 was short of options without @entity2 ’s physicality during the autumn internationals , and the @entity1 coach will once again turn to his midfield reserves when he names his squad on wednesday for the next campaign , which kicks off in @entity27 on february 6			1
@entity5 centre @entity2 has been struggling with a groin injury since october @entity2 could miss the games against @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 after several injury setbacks in recent months ‘ it ’s slow but it ’s getting there , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ the end of february would be all right — that would be ideal but i have to get this right			0
it ’s not like a sprained ankle you can strap it up and get on with it			0
i have to make sure that if i need to take another week or two then i take it			0
‘ when it first happened the doctor said it would be six to eight weeks			0
i was pretty happy then			0
when i realised it was going to be longer it was hard to stay focused mentally because it ’s my second time out for a long time , after a pectoral injury			2
it ’s part of the game , you have to ride it out and come back			0
’ @entity2 suffered a heavy strain to his adductor , which tore away from his pubis bone during the @entity59 tie against @entity60			1
surgery is not seen as an effective means to fix the problem , so prolotherapy treatment has been used to aid the recovery			0
‘ it ’s a sugar injection that goes straight into the bone and it basically holds it together like chewing gum sticking together , ’ said @entity2			1
@entity2 has not featured for @entity1 since the three - test summer tour of @entity71 in 2014 ‘ those injections worked really well			1
when i did it i could hardly walk and could feel the pubis going up and down but now it works really well			0
with the pubis , not many people have operations there as it ’s quite hard to get fixed			0
’ while @entity1 are still scratching heads over their best combinations for the @entity83 , @entity16 have a far more settled feel about their squad			1
@entity85 will name his @entity3 party this morning and the @entity87 is expected to call upon his countryman , @entity88 , who won the @entity89 with @entity71			2
the no 10 joined the @entity91 from @entity92 in november and is eligible for selection through his @entity27 - born mother			2
@entity88 will compete with @entity97 fly - half @entity95 for the starting jersey , but hopes of a call - up for @entity5 ’s @entity101 were looking slim when the selection committee convened yesterday afternoon			2
former @entity92 fly half @entity88 ( above ) is set to be named in the @entity104 squad @entity105 understands that , despite his decision to turn down a return to @entity16 , @entity101 was in the running last week , before he was dropped ahead of a potential showdown with @entity110 in @entity5 ’s @entity59 tie against the @entity112 on friday			1
@entity115 fly - half @entity113 will miss the @entity3 and could be out for up to four months after surgery on his right bicep			1
@entity2 is a @entity118 ambassador			2
@entity118 is the only place to watch top live matches from the new @entity59 , @entity121 and the @entity122 .			0
