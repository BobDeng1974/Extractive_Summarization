coalition relations are at breaking point as a furious row saw @entity3 branded a ‘ w * * * * * ’ by conservative colleagues			2
the row followed home secretary @entity7 ’s bitter attack on the @entity10 leader ’s refusal to give police and intelligence services powers to monitor internet , email and phone use of terror suspects			1
mrs may , increasingly tipped as a future @entity19 leader , accused the @entity10 of being ‘ outrageously irresponsible ’ in blocking legislation to address a ‘ crisis in national security ’ , claiming they had put children ’s lives at risk			1
the row between @entity7 and @entity3 came after the @entity10 leader 's refusal to give police services to monitor phone calls of terror suspects yesterday , mr @entity3 demanded an apology over what he called ‘ a new low point in @entity36 relations ’ , accusing mrs may of ‘ false and outrageous slurs ’			1
he said : ‘ i have made it very , very clear to her that i expect an apology from her			0
’ but the prime minister backed mrs may last night and mr @entity3 ’s complaint was ridiculed by senior @entity43			1
one told the @entity44 that mr @entity3 was a ‘ w * * * * * ’ , and claimed his request to see the home secretary ’s conference speech in advance this week had been rejected			1
another source close to mrs may repeated the accusation that the @entity10 were putting children at risk			1
‘ it ’s interesting to see how the @entity10 react to the logic of their position being aired in public but the truth is that they are putting lives at risk right now , ’ the source said			1
‘ if they want to do something about that , they can start talking to us about returning to the @entity67 that @entity3 first torpedoed on his radio show two years ago			2
’ last night @entity10 mp @entity69 called for an official investigation into the use of derogatory language to describe mr @entity3			1
he said the aide had breached the special adviser code of conduct			0
@entity76 backed the home secretary , saying : ‘ i thought @entity7 made a very strong speech about how important it is that we protect people from the dangers of terrorism on our streets and she set out a series of measures we have taken			0
' she set out some measures that a @entity19 - only government would take to make us even more safe			0
’ mr @entity3 has now demanded an apology over what he called ‘ a new low point in @entity36 relations ’ government sources suggested the @entity36 had entered a ‘ new phase ’ with just over 200 days to go before the @entity94			1
‘ the two parties are going to make it clearer than ever where they disagree , ’ said one @entity19 minister			0
yesterday ’s row focused on plans for a @entity103 , which would have meant telecommunications firms storing details of the time , duration , location and recipients of messages sent on social media , emails and mobile phones for up to 12 months			0
mrs may said it was vital to allow the authorities to gain more insight into terrorist plots and other crimes			0
but last year , mr @entity3 announced he was blocking the plans			2
the @entity119 claims that as a result , over the past six months the @entity120 dropped 20 cases because of missing communications data , 13 of which involved a threat to the lives of children			2
mr @entity3 , speaking on @entity128 , said : ‘ to say i ’ve put children at risk is a level of misinformation i ’ve not witnessed in four and a half years of this government			1
’ mrs may , increasingly tipped as a future @entity19 leader , accused the @entity10 of being ‘ outrageously irresponsible ’ in blocking legislation ‘ the reason the @entity120 had to drop some of these cases was because ip addresses were not properly matched to individual mobile devices			1
‘ i have been saying for months that that is a problem we should deal with , and guess who has been dragging their feet to do something about it – the @entity119			2
' i think i am entitled to be a little bit aggrieved to hear a conservative home secretary somehow claiming that my party is putting children at risk when it is their inactivity that is doing just that			2
’ meanwhile @entity19 mps are pressing mr @entity76 to move more quickly on his pledge to raise the 40p tax threshold to £ 50,000			0
the prime minister has pledged to raise the starting threshold from its current level of £ 41,865 by 2020			0
but mp @entity160 suggested the tax cut could be implemented in three years			0
he said : ‘ we have always got to take care of the deficit and for that reason it ca n’t be done in one go immediately			0
' but we need to do it as quickly as possible , and there is no reason why we could n’t do it in three years			0

row comes after mr @entity3 refused to back powers for intelligence services
@entity7 has accused @entity10 of being ' outrageously irresponsible '
also claimed that they have being putting children 's lives at risk
but mr @entity3 *denied* this saying the @entity119 is ' dragging their feet '
