a wildlife park has banned visitors from wearing leopard print clothing - because it is confusing the animals			2
@entity4 today introduced the zero - tolerance policy on animal print and even brought in bouncers to enforce it			1
zookeepers noticed the trend for animal print clothing had caused animals to try to communicate with those wearing it - or to run away in fear			1
you 're a funny - looking leopard : a wildlife park has banned visitors from wearing animal print clothing - because it is confusing the animals the ban follows the launch of a new experience ' @entity23 : @entity25 ! ' , which sees visitors journey off - road on a safari adventure			1
they come face - to - face with white rhinos , giraffes , flamingos , waterbuck and other antelopes such as blesbok			0
since the launch of the 22 - acre @entity41 - style trail , @entity38 's zookeepers have noticed the wildlife ' becoming puzzled ' when spotting visitors that look like them			0
@entity23 spokeswoman @entity45 said : ' @entity23 lets visitors get so close to wild species that if someone wears the same pattern to the animal 's coat they can become over friendly			2
' if they wear the pattern of its predator , it has the opposite effect and the animals become afraid and run away			1
' animal print - wearing visitors will be handed grey boiler suits and ordered to wear them everywhere in the park so as not to antagonise or excite other animals including lions and tigers			1
spots and stripes : @entity4 today introduced the zero - tolerance policy on animal print and brought in bouncers to enforce it the resort has hired @entity72 to identify anyone wearing leggings , coats , tops , hats or dresses which flout the regulations			1
banned prints at @entity4 include zebra , giraffe , leopard , cheetah , tiger and even hyena and african wild dog			1
ms @entity45 added : ' since the launch of @entity23 , guests have interacted with the animals more closely than ever before			2
' we have noticed a lot of animals becoming baffled by animal - print - wearing guests			1
' the enclosures at @entity23 have been designed to replicate the conditions species face in the wild			0
' therefore it 's no wonder animals are getting confused when they see what looks like zebras and giraffes driving across the terrain in a 7.5 tonne truck			2
animal behaviour consultant dr @entity107 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , said colours and patterns can provoke strong reactions in animals zero tolerance : those who break the rules will be forced to wear boiler suits ' we kindly ask guests to refrain from wearing animal print at the park			1
' animal behaviour consultant dr @entity107 , of @entity109 , @entity110 , said colours and patterns can provoke strong reactions in animals			2
she said : ' certain colourations give warning signals to other animals			0
' for instance the yellow and black stripe of a bee is there as a warning and leopard print or tiger print will trigger some sort of instinct as well			0
' colours and patterns are there for a reason in nature - it 's about predator - prey interaction			0
' my dog has probably never seen a snake in her life but i would expect her to act with trepidation if she saw a stripey snake as opposed to a plain one			0
' movement is also a key trigger			0
big cats will start getting interested if someone limps past their enclosure because they look weak			0
' possibly the worst thing you could do is limp past the lion or tiger enclosure in a zebra print outfit			0
