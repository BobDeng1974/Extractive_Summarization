the @entity0 ! cast always assembles a lists of curious characters and this year is no different			2
with a list ranging from former sporting heroes to @entity7 ( or is it @entity7 be these days ? ) regulars , there seems to be plenty of scope to draw in viewers			0
one such sporting hero is @entity12 , and @entity13 gives you the lowdown on the former superbike champion video : scroll down to watch @entity12 take part in the snake trial in i 'm a @entity20 ! @entity12 is one of the stars on a new series of @entity0 ! debut : @entity23 1989 race starts : 219 @entity25 : 4 ( 1994 / 1995 / 1998 / 1999 ) @entity26 : 21 podiums : 108 race wins : 59 seconds : 32 thirds : 17 @entity29 : 16 total points : 3,008 so , @entity31 is a former champion - did he have just one fortunate season to win a title ? behave yourself			1
' @entity12 ' is a four - time @entity36 champion , dominating the sport in the 1990s with title wins in 1994 , 1995 , 1998 and 1999			1
the 49 - year - old was also runner - up in 1997 and 1993			0
where has he been since the turn of the millennium ? unfortunately , after a promising start to the 2000 season and looking in a good position to win a fifth title on his much loved @entity48 , @entity12 crashed heavily during the fourth round at @entity52 's @entity51 which prematurely ended his racing career			1
@entity31 won four @entity36 championships in the 1990s as he dominated the sport foggy waves the @entity57 after winning the @entity58 at @entity23 on his @entity48 i see , very unfortunate			1
was his whole career spent winning @entity58 titles on a @entity48 ? in between his title wins , @entity12 had a year at @entity64 in 1996 where despite struggling he still managed to win four races			1
the @entity67 enjoyed success in other disciplines too , winning @entity71 tt championships in the 1980s as well as the @entity72 in 1992 - winning the @entity74 24 race in the same year ( the two wheel version , obviously			0
) as well as a handful of @entity77 starts where he had a best finish of sixth , he also triumphed in the @entity81			0
@entity12 passed his @entity83 trial in the jungle , completing the challenge of having to lie in a pit of snakes 1999 - world superbike champion 1998 - world superbike champion 1997 - 2nd - @entity36 1996 - 4th - @entity36 1995 - world superbike champion 1994 - world superbike champion 1993 - 2nd - @entity36 1992 - 9th - @entity36 1st - @entity72 1991 - 7th - @entity36 1990 - @entity92 f1 @entity90 champion @entity93 and @entity95 races 1989 - @entity97 champion 1st - 750cc @entity81 1988 - @entity98 the @entity81 ? ! no wonder he barley flinched when he came up against snakes - it 's fair to say he is a celebrated @entity102 sporting hero then ? you said it			1
even before he won his third and fourth @entity58 titles he was awarded an mbe in the 1998 @entity109 ' honours list			0
his abrasive up front character reflects an aggressive approach , but even @entity12 has admitted in recent times he is not as mentally tough as many would think			2
so what 's he been up to since ? apart from putting up with @entity83 trials and @entity116 ' snoring ? @entity31 started his own @entity58 team , @entity118 , in 2001 which ran for five years and achieved a couple of podium finishes before folding			0
@entity12 's outside interests include trail riding , motocross , sea fishing and even football with the racing legend a fan of hometown club @entity130			2
after his racing career , @entity12 started up his racing team with @entity134 which folded in 2006 @entity31 supports @entity130 who won the @entity136 in 1995 as the @entity67 was winning his second @entity58 title			0
