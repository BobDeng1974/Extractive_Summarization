@entity0 ( right ) was in attendance for the @entity28 draw in @entity29 @entity32 scores from the penalty spot during the @entity34 2 - 1 victory over @entity23 in october the main objective , however , is next june and given that @entity2 were knocked out of the group stages in the last two tournaments in @entity38 ( 2013 ) and @entity16 ( 2011 ) without winning a game , @entity0 appreciates @entity2 have to change perceptions			1
‘ it is a cracking group , a group to get excited about , ’ @entity0 told @entity41			1
‘ they are really good fixtures , they are fixtures that will capture the imagination			0
yes , they are difficult teams but they are bound to be if you get to this stage			0
it is on to the next challenge			0
‘ we are effectively in the quarter - finals of this competition and i have never heard of anyone having any easy time at this stage			2
that is the mentality that we have got to have			0
if we want to win the tournament , which we do , then we can not complain about who we have got to play			2
@entity63 forward @entity32 has earned his first call - up to the senior squad after his fine form this season ‘ you have to deal with whatever is thrown in front of you			2
if we want to be a winning team , that is how it must be			2
we ’ve been very good at qualifying for tournaments but we have got to take that to the next stage			0
now we have got to prove that we can be very good at tournaments			0
’ a delegation , headed by @entity0 , will begin their search today for a suitable base next summer and with the group only having a restricted amount of time between now and next june , the head coach appreciates that every second counts			2
‘ what is important now is that we do not waste a single minute when we get together , ’ said @entity0 , whose squad will also face @entity86 in @entity87 this month			1
‘ preparation , for the group as a whole , is limited and we have got to take advantage of the time we have together			0
‘ i am not quite sure how the ( @entity7 ) team we play next week will compare to the one we play next summer			1
they have had a few players moved up to the senior team , as have we			0
but it will still be interesting			0
it will be a good test for us			0
