at that point he turns and says : ' it 's all getting a bit @entity40 [ a @entity26 journalist known for her investigative interviewing ]			0
' the horror was clear to see on @entity10 's face as he questioned @entity8 about where he was trying to take their chat but @entity10 is n't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning			1

the presenter questions him : ' do you worry about @entity130 around your mum as he seems to like older women ?

during the segment @entity160 played @entity55 a clip of @entity178 insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact			0
