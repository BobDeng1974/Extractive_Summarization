by @entity1 reporter published : 12:12 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 14:22 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 has introduced her baby to horseracing by taking the newborn to a @entity8 equestrian center			1
@entity3 , 31 , gave birth to her son @entity10 on christmas eve in @entity11 but the baby has already become a jetsetter			2
@entity3 was spotted cradling the little boy alongside her boyfriend , the boy 's father @entity16 , at the @entity18 in @entity19 on sunday			1
happy family : @entity3 and boyfriend @entity16 pose with their newborn son @entity21 during a trip to a @entity8 equestrian center on sunday new title : ms @entity3 , 31 , gave birth to @entity27 on christmas eve in @entity11 looking out for the little guy : ms @entity3 said that she has been ' lucky enough ' to afford to hire help big name : the baby 's full name is @entity10 , with his two middle names as clear homages to her parents - @entity37 and @entity38 the couple had massive grins across their faces throughout the visit as @entity3 held the baby in her arms while watching the horse jumping			1
they were joined by an unidentified woman at one point during the event , but the new mom was completely focused on her little baby			0
@entity27 's early introduction to the world of horse racing comes as little surprise as both his parents are professional equestrians			1
' @entity16 and i have known each other since i was 15 ; we met doing the same horse shows			0
then in october of last year , we were both single and decided we were mature enough for a real relationship , ' she told @entity63			0
similar interests : @entity10 and @entity37 are both professional equestrians and met when she was 15 support : the new parents were joined by an unidentified woman during their sunday visit to the horse arena doting : ms @entity3 and her friend tried to stop the baby 's cries , tying his white cap on more securely to see if that helped the little tot ' when we realized we wanted to become parents , i stopped taking birth control			1
( i was in @entity82 when i realized i was pregnant — good thing i found out on the early side of the trip ! ) ' the horse - loving pair are going to waste no time in getting their son out in the arena , and in august she revealed that she had ' one little rescued mini ' named @entity93 she plan on giving to their son			2
' we 're gon na try popping a little saddle on him , and get him ready , ' she told the @entity99 at the time			0
' we have a couple of years to get him all trained up			0
solution : @entity21 calmed down instantly once he got his bottle natural : ms @entity3 said that she and her boyfriend intend to co-parent the child and are very much together but she never had any desire to marry after her parent 's marriage ended in divorce during her childhood milestone : @entity27 is the first grandchild for @entity37 , @entity3 's billionaire father happy surprise : @entity3 previously revealed that while she and @entity16 started their relationship in october before realizing that she was pregnant during a trip to @entity82 in the spring tropical climes : @entity21 was born in @entity11 but the family has been in @entity8 for much of his life ' i kind of always said when i first rescued this little mini that i wanted him to be my first child 's pony			1
' though @entity10 and @entity37 are very much together and will be raising the child together , marriage is not on the horizon for the pair			0
because of her parent 's divorce , @entity3 explained that she has never planned on getting married , telling @entity63 that she does n't ' need a marriage license and a party '			2
that sentiment does n't run through her entire family , however , as her older sister @entity136 , 34 , has been married since 2005 though she and her husband @entity137 do not have any children			0
back on the party circuit : @entity3 got right back into gown 12 days after giving birth , as she attended the @entity143 hosted by @entity144 on january 5 , pictured with @entity145 and @entity146 ms @entity3 said that she has hired help , but enjoys spending as much time with the little tot as possible			1
' i am lucky enough to be in a position to be able to afford help , but i really want to be involved and experience the responsibility and , of course , the bonding , ' @entity3 told the @entity99			0
' having a baby is something i ’ve always wanted and i ’m obviously going to do as much for him myself as i possibly can			0
' it has n't stopped her from getting back on the social circuit , however , as she was seen earlier this month at an event at @entity144 's @entity19 golf course			2
barely showing : the heiress attended a @entity166 benefit in mid november ( seen here with her father ) , just shy of six weeks before her due date men in her life : @entity3 is the younger daughter of @entity37 , who has temporarily left public life after finishing his third term as @entity11 's mayor , and @entity16 was her date to the @entity166 benefit			1
