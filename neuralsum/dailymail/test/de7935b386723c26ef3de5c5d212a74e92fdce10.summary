rating : what on earth makes us think the @entity3 do off - beat restaurants with rooms better than us ? they do n't			2
we are streets ahead when it comes to fetching up at a place like @entity9 and hoping to find somewhere decent to eat and sleep			2
very decent , in fact , here at @entity13			0
happiness on a plate : the @entity17 has been around for ten years , and revels in an understated luxury we are paying £ 100 for two people , dinner , bed and breakfast			1
dinner alone would usually be about £ 60 ; breakfast at least a tenner each			0
so that means the room costs a mere £ 20			0
i am almost embarrassed and seek clarification from a friendly young man called @entity32 , who shows us to our room on the top floor with wonderful views across the @entity37 , where swans preen themselves as the sun sets and the tide recedes			1
we are in @entity41 , just down the road from @entity43			1
seafood dining : mersea oysters are available year - round - as are @entity47 natives , when in season connected : the hotel is a two - minute walk from @entity9 station which has services to @entity53 @entity52 i had never heard of @entity9 , but what a fascinating spot , with a grand twin - towered church ( designed by @entity64 ) that originally was meant to be a spa , gorgeous terraces of @entity57 houses , industrial buildings near the quay that have not yet been dolled up , a @entity60			1

we kick off with nibbles that include a stupendous olive tapenade			0
then i 'm on to six @entity102 oysters followed by superb sea bass , while my wife raves about her chowder , followed by moules with chips			0
everything feels relaxed because it is so well - organised , unpretentious and welcoming			2
@entity32 rushes around purposely , and is still doing so in the morning , putting tables and chairs outside in the spring sunshine , papers in the rack , milk in the jug , and arranging eggs from ' happy hens ' owned by one of the managers			0
and there you have it			0
