in an effort to ensure global food security , 10,000 new varieties of crops from around the world are being added to the ' doomsday ' seed vault in the @entity7			1
the @entity11 , on an island off @entity10 's northern coast , already stores 825,000 samples of seeds , which represent 13,000 years of agricultural history			1
the vault provides a back - up to the network of seed banks around the world , which store seeds but can be threatened by war , accidents and natural disasters			1
a series of deliveries of seeds to @entity11 this month will help in that fight , the @entity35 said			1
four shipments from major genebanks based in @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are delivering varieties from more than 100 countries			1
the shipments include types of wheat , barley , corn , sorghum , peal millet , chickpea , groundnut , @entity58 and @entity60 aubergine			1
the @entity11 , on an island off @entity10 's northern coast , already stores 825,000 samples of seeds which represent 13,000 years of agricultural history the shipments include types of wheat ( pictured ) , barley , corn , peal millet , chickpea and groundnut seeds of a number of indigenous @entity60 vegetables , including okra , amaranth , spider plant and jute mallow are also being deposited			1
preserving different food plant varieties will help breed and develop crops that can withstand a changing climate , for example , by being more drought resistant or able to cope with higher temperatures , the trust said			2
the @entity86 is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the @entity89 desert violent turmoil in the @entity92 could indirectly lead to millions of people starving from food shortages , research suggests			2
scientists have found that the highest concentration of wild crop plants needed to produce new food varieties lie in an area known as the @entity86			2
however , this area is also at the centre of a number of civil wars that are placing valuable crop species at risk of extinction			0
the @entity86 is an ancient area of fertile soil arcing around the @entity89 desert from @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and ending in @entity114 and @entity115			0
it has the largest diversity of ' crop wild relatives ' ( @entity117 ) - species closely related to our crops which are needed to create future ' super crop ' varieties			0
given that the human population is set to expand from the 7.26 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050 , @entity124 will be needed to improve crop yields and feed the extra people			0
but researchers at @entity129 have shown that 12 per cent of @entity124 are threatened with extinction and all are likely to be already suffering a loss of genetic diversity			0
@entity134 , executive director of the @entity35 , said : ' the @entity11 symbolises how we can create a long - term , sustainable and positive solution to feed the world forever			1
' the issue of hunger is global , and increasingly urgent			0
if we continue as we are , food production will be reduced and food prices will rise			0
even more people will go hungry			0
' crop diversity is essential if we are to provide more food , more nutritious food and affordable food for the poor			0
' maintaining crop diversity , and the genetic wealth it provides to current and future generations , is beneficial not just to crop breeders , but to the farmers that feed all of us on this planet			0
' the @entity35 is calling on governments , businesses , foundations and wealthy individuals to contribute to a Â£ 500 million ( $ 800 million ) endowment fund which will pay to conserve crop varieties in perpetuity			2
the seed vault is located in @entity11 , a @entity10 archipelago in the @entity167			1
it is situated north of mainland @entity170 , it is about midway between continental @entity10 and the @entity171			2

@entity11 is located on @entity11 off @entity10 's northern coast
vault provides a back - up to network of seed banks around the world
seeds from @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are been delivered
shipments include wheat , barley , maize , chickpea and groundnut
it will be vital to ensuring food security in the face of climate change , warns @entity35 , the organisation which manages the vault
