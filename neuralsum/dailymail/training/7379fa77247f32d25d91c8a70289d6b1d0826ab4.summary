by @entity0 published : 01:23 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 02:42 est , 9 july 2013 he has been jabbing his finger at wannabe apprentices for almost a decade			2
but it seems @entity5 may be preparing to quit the @entity7 show that turned him into the nation ’s most recognisable – and irascible – business tycoon			1
the 66 - year - old , who is chairman of the @entity13 group of companies , may leave to devote more time to his other work , his right - hand man has claimed			1
@entity16 ( left ) said he ' would n't be surprised ' if @entity5 ( centre ) quit @entity18 next year five candidates are left in this year 's series - the ninth - but the opening episode was watched by six million viewers , down on the 8.1million who tuned for the 2008 series opener @entity16 , who sits next to @entity5 in @entity18 boardroom , said he ‘ would n’t be surprised ’ if he left after the tenth series next year			1
he told the @entity28 : ‘ he wo n’t get bored			2
but he is all over this show for 12 months of the year , every task , every aspect of the scheduling , marketing , and press – everything			1
‘ do n’t think he just pops in , does his little bit and pushes off home			0
he ’s very devoted : possibly , i think , to the detriment of his other business interests			0
‘ i would n’t be surprised if at some point after ten years he said , ‘ actually lads , i think i ’ve done my bit			1
’ @entity16 first met @entity5 in 1983 when his @entity46 company was chosen to represent the businessman ’s company @entity49			1
since then , they have become firm friends as well as business confidantes			0
the 69 - year - old , who hosts countdown as well as helping with @entity18 , said he was ‘ only speculating ’ about @entity5 ’s future , but felt the tycoon had ‘ done his duty ’			1
he added : ‘ he might say he ’s only going to do 11 or 12 series , but then find it hard to walk away because it ’s his baby			2
’ in recent years , @entity18 has seen its audience ratings slump			0
this year ’s opening episode was watched by 6million viewers , down on the 8.1million who tuned in for the 2008 series opener			1
@entity16 said @entity5 has been so devoted to the programme it has been to the ' detriment of his other business interests ' @entity16 was speaking to @entity28 about the future of the show the show has brought @entity5 other headaches			1
earlier this year , he was forced to give evidence to an employment tribunal after a former winner , @entity77 , claimed she was treated like an ‘ overpaid lackey ’ in her prize job			2
in 2009 , senior @entity83 called for him to quit the programme after he became @entity86 ’s ‘ enterprise tsar ’ , but he stayed on after agreeing to suspend public activity during the airing of his shows			0
@entity16 said the @entity7 should not attempt to replace @entity5 with another host if he does decide to leave the show			1
he said : ‘ people would pay to do that job			0
but as a broadcaster , the @entity7 would have a really tough decision whether or not to rest this programme			0
‘ if @entity5 says , “ look , i ’ve done my ten years , ” or whatever it is , if he thinks he ’s done his bit , i think they would be crackers to run it the next year with someone else			1
‘ because it ’s his show , and he ’s made such an impression that you would need to be a suicide merchant to take it on after @entity5 in the next year			1
‘ rest it for three years , let the memories dim , and then bring it back			0
but , you know , somebody will say , “ are you mad ? we want those eight million viewers , ” or whatever it is			0
it ’s a huge show			2
nobody wants to say " cheerio " to such a successful format			0
that will be a hard decision			0
’ @entity16 added the @entity7 should not attempt to change the format of @entity18 to try to attract more viewers			1
he said : ‘ if you have a great format , you tinker with it at your peril , because there ’s a little bit of magic in that format			0
this series has been as fresh as ever , and i think the grit in the oyster is the jeopardy			2
‘ that someone sat on their squashy sofa in @entity138 who has n’t got a job can quite legitimately shout at the telly , “ do n’t do that , you idiot , i could do better			0
” that ’s the magic			0

@entity16 said he ' would n't be surprised ' if @entity5 left show next year
said he may leave to concentrate on his @entity13 group of companies
@entity16 believes lord @entity5 could leave after the tenth series
