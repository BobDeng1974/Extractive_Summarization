by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 has described @entity4 traumatic reign as @entity6 manager as an ' absolute disaster '			1
@entity2 , a graduate of the lauded class of ' 92 , was hired by @entity4 as his first - team coach last summer and he witnessed the disintegration unfold before his very eyes			1
@entity6 slumped to the club 's worst finish in 24 years , ending the season in 7th place in the @entity17 table amid a chorus of disapproval from the @entity21 crowd			1
we must all take responsibility , not just @entity4			0
i take responsibility and so does everyone involved			0
' @entity2 , who continued to work with the first - team as part of @entity42 ' backroom staff when @entity4 was sacked in april , has now left the club following a summer of uncertainty			2
@entity2 will work as a @entity30 pundit on @entity46 but he harbours little resentment towards @entity6 and he has even tipped @entity48 to lead the club to the @entity17 title			1
' i think we ’re going to win the league			0
i ’m sure that ’s what @entity48 will be saying to the players because second is n’t any good at @entity6			2
' we ’ve got a great chance this year because there ’s no @entity61 football			1
' it ’s about regrouping and all the lads have come back for pre-season and look like they ’re ready to win the league again			2
' @entity2 also remains on good terms with lifelong friend @entity42 , who has remained at the club as @entity69 's assistant manager			0
when a fan asked who the best player he had played with was , @entity2 joked : ' @entity42			0
and he 's just sacked me as well ! ' fresh start : @entity48 will hope to perform a little better than his predecessor at @entity21 this year			0
