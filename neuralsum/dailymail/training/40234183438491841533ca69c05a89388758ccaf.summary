@entity1 's early season form may have led to comparisons with the @entity5 ' @entity4 ' side , but @entity6 believes they are n't even as good as the @entity1 side from 10 years ago			1
@entity10 's side are currently four points clear at the top of the @entity13 , but after letting leads slip against both @entity16 and @entity17 , their killer instinct has been called into question			1
' if a team are going to be playing for a 1 - 0 then you better see it out , ' @entity6 said on @entity22			2
' when i saw @entity10 two weeks ago he talked about the 2005 ( @entity1 ) team and ( compared ) the team he had then to the team he has now and he said the killer instinct 's missing			1
@entity1 have dropped more points from winning positions this season than they did in the whole of 2004/05 @entity1 took the lead against both @entity17 and @entity16 , but drew both matches ' when i look at the statistics they are staggering - 28 times they ( the 2004/05 team ) scored first ( in @entity13 matches ) , 27 the season after and they only dropped two and four points ( respectively )			1
' this team this season , even though they 're at a really high level , have scored first seven times and already dropped four points			2
they 've got to get to that next level			0
' ' when ( @entity48 ) @entity16 went down to 10 men i thought @entity1 let them off the hook and yesterday at 1 - 0 up i think @entity1 let @entity17 off the hook			1
' there 's a mentality shift			0
@entity6 was talking on @entity54 ' @entity22 show with @entity56 's @entity55 @entity58 scores @entity17 's injury - time equaliser against @entity1 at @entity60 the away side had appeared to be in control of the game but were undone with just moments remaining ' at @entity16 they went from 55 per cent possession for the 10 minutes before the goal , and the 10 minutes after they went to 26 per cent possession , and @entity16 had 10 men			1
that ca n't be an instruction from the manager			0
that 's a shift in the players			0
' yesterday ( against @entity17 ) they went from 64 per cent ( possession before scoring ) to 45 per cent ( after scoring )			2
' this is not the manager changing it			0
the players who have worked themselves into a 1 - 0 lead have then sat deeper			0

@entity1 are four points clear at the top of the @entity13
@entity10 's side have proved themselves to be early title *favourites*
but @entity6 believes there is still room for *improvement*
the former @entity17 *defender* *criticised* their lack of killer instinct
@entity1 dropped points against both @entity48 clubs
