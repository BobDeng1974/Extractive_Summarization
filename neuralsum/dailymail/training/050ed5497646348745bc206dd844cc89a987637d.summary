border guards have been banned from asking @entity2 nationals how long they intend to stay in the @entity3 or even what they plan to do here			2
the @entity6 move , confirmed by the @entity7 , prompted incredulity among @entity9 , who called for @entity3 to regain control of its borders			1
@entity2 officials claim asking new arrivals even basic questions would breach free movement rules			2
the diktat 's existence , revealed last night in a report by @entity9 , means the @entity7 is powerless to count net migration to @entity3 accurately			1
a @entity6 diktat that bans border guards from asking @entity2 nationals how long they intend to stay in the @entity3 has prompted incredulity among mps instead , ministers must continue to rely on a voluntary survey – the one that , as the @entity27 revealed earlier this month , underestimated the number of new arrivals from @entity29 by 350,000			1
the @entity2 rule is another blow for the £ 500million e-borders programme unveiled in 2003 to check the details of passengers arriving and leaving the @entity3 and to screen them for security purposes			1
the scheme has been dogged by it problems and is still not working fully			0
mps on the @entity39 had said that e-borders – when complete – should be used by the government to produce accurate figures on net migration			1
but yesterday the @entity7 said this would not be possible because visitors from the @entity2 can not be asked how long they plan to stay			1
only those who intend to live here for more than a year are officially classed as immigrants			0
as a result , the e-borders data would not be complete			0
in a letter to mps , the @entity7 said asking @entity2 migrants detailed questions ' would be subject to challenge as disproportionate '			1
@entity56 mp @entity55 said : ' it 's bad enough that @entity2 law has stripped @entity3 of proper border controls ' it continued : ' it should be noted that @entity2 free movement legislation supported by historical @entity63 judgments prevent @entity64 from routinely asking additional questions ... beyond those necessary to establish nationality and identity			2
' last night @entity56 mp @entity55 said : ' it 's bad enough that @entity2 law has stripped @entity3 of proper border controls			2
' but it adds insult to injury that , having invested heavily in a system that would enable the authorities to keep track of who is coming and going , @entity6 has now banned us from using it			0
' the fiasco leaves @entity3 reliant on the @entity79 , which is based on voluntary interviews with migrants and was described by mps as ' not fit for purpose '			0
earlier this month , the @entity27 revealed that the @entity79 had failed to count 350,000 eastern @entity85 immigrants because inspectors were at the wrong airports , with only a handful at places such as @entity90 and @entity91 , where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving			0
the @entity2 rule is another blow for the £ 500million e-borders programme unveiled in 2003 to check the details of passengers arriving and leaving the @entity3 in addition , immigrants on many ferry routes were rarely or never checked and tens of thousands of children were missed			1
failures meant that between 2001 and 2011 , net migration – the population change after both immigration and emigration are counted – was underestimated by 346,000 , equivalent to a city the size of @entity108			1
nearly a quarter of a million went uncounted between 2005 and 2008			0
the @entity7 said improvements had been made to the @entity79 , adding : ' we do not agree with the conclusion that the @entity79 is inadequate for measuring , managing and understanding levels of migration			2
' officials said the @entity116 had made a number of improvements and the estimates ' are at the national level as reliable and accurate as is possible to achieve under current survey design and levels of funding '			0
a @entity7 spokesperson said : ' the @entity7 agrees with both the @entity116 and @entity125 that the @entity79 is the best measure of net migration			1
data from the @entity129 is supplied to the @entity116 to help improve estimates of net migration			1
@entity131 , chairman of the @entity133 select committee , said the public have been ' badly let down ' the spokesman added : ' under this government all passengers are now subject to checks , the majority before they even arrive in the @entity3 in addition to at the border			0
' while @entity2 freedom of movement legislation prevents @entity64 from routinely asking @entity2 citizens questions in support of migration statistics , @entity64 officers do routinely examine passengers seeking entry to the @entity3			2
' passengers can be detained for further questioning , including those from within the @entity2 , if the officer suspects the individual is presenting a false identity or nationality or they have reason to suspect the individual is involved in crime , terrorism or immigration offences			0
' but @entity131 , chairman of the @entity133 select committee , said : ' i am deeply concerned by the @entity7 's response			0
' the e-borders programme has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds , taken more than a decade and now we know that a key original objective will never be achieved			1
the public have been badly let down			0

@entity7 is powerless to count net migration accurately
instead , ministers must continue to rely on a voluntary survey
the @entity6 diktat has prompted incredulity among mps
@entity2 rule is another blow for the £ 500m e-borders programme
