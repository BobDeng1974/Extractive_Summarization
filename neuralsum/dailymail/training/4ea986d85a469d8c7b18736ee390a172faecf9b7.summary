@entity2 's @entity1 page shows you the profile @entity2 has built up of your interests - based on information gleaned from your visits to site 's within @entity2 's advertising network it has been said that @entity2 knows more about what you like than your own partner now the search giant has given a glimpse on just how much information it has collected - and who thinks you are			1
but it seems the famed @entity2 algorithms are far from infallible			2
and people taking advantage of the facility that allows the public to view what kind of consumer @entity2 thinks they are have been amused to find themselves listed with the wrong age and even sex			1
nevertheless , the knowledge that @entity2 works so hard to profile its 350m account holders is bound to intensify the debate about privacy which flared up again this week with the announcement that the company was going to start tracking users across all of its sites , including @entity38			1
the detailed personal ' profile ' sums up many of a user 's interests , along with age and gender			0
@entity2 builds a detailed profile by harvesting the history of its account holders ' visits to sites in its advertising network			1
but your age and gender are decided by those of other @entity2 users who have visited the sites you visit , leading to the mistakes			1
25 years out and the wrong gender			0
@entity61 , @entity60 says i 'm 65 + and male ... last time i checked i was 42 and female ! @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity66 seems i 've aged 20 years because i like home , gardening and cats			0
i may well turn into the mad cat lady in 20 years , but i 'm not there yet ! @entity74 , @entity75 one blogger from tech site @entity78 found this week that @entity2 's @entity1 page assume that she was middle - aged - and a man , simply because her interests included technology and computing			1
the profile page , called @entity1 , is hidden away inside a settings menu in @entity86 , but can be accessed directly here			0
this sort of in - depth profiling raises alarm bells with privacy activists			0
' consumers have increasingly digital lives and they are developing an unfathomably large data trail every day , ' says @entity94 , activism director for privacy group @entity95			0
' there has never been another time in history where privacy was under the kind of assault it is today			0
' you can opt out of the tracking , or manually edit your details			0
@entity2 also does not store information on controversial subjects such as pornography			1
the ad preferences page came to public attention following a sweeping change to ' privacy policy ' which comes into effect on march 1 , although the preferences page was launched some time ago			0
@entity38 data , @entity116 information and search data will all be used to build up ever more accurate advertising profiles and also the company claims it will make searches more personalised			0
the @entity78 writer 's interests meant that @entity123 identified her , wrongly , as being both middle - aged and a man in most cases , though , the data is eerily accurate , bringing up a breakdown of interests , age and sex			2
the @entity132 information that @entity2 gathers is sent out as a ' cookie ' - a packet of information sent out by your browser - whenever you visit other @entity2 partners , who then serve up ' relevant ' adverts when you visit their sites			1
users who are fearful of the amount of information @entity2 holds can block the profiling by disabling ' cookies ' in their internet browser settings			2
@entity2 says , ' we associate interests with your ads preferences based on the types of websites that you visit within the the @entity154			2
' ' for example , when you browse many gardening - related websites in the the @entity154 , @entity2 may associate a gardening preference with your cookie			1
' ' if the sites that you visit have a majority of female visitors , we may associate your cookie with the female demographic category			0
' some users reported that @entity2 had identified bizarre interests such as ' sweets and candy ' , and was duly serving them adverts appropriate to that ' interest '			2
you can manually change your ' interests ' from your @entity170 - although you can not , of course , stop @entity2 from sending you adverts .			1

' @entity1 ' sums up who @entity2 thinks you like
information collected from sites you visit
@entity2 ' guesses ' your age and sex - often wrong
information used to serve you adverts as you browse
