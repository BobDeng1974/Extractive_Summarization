conspiracy theorists started forming their theories about the @entity3 bombings just hours after the attack , as they claimed the explosions were set up by @entity7 government forces			1
in the first press conference following the fatal explosions that left three dead and 176 injured , a conservative blogger asked whether it was a ' false flag staged attack '			2
false flag attacks are instances where governments are thought to have arranged a violent incident - theoretically like monday 's bombing - in order to scare its citizens into handing over controls to the federal authorities			2
runners continue to run towards the finish line of the @entity3 as an explosion erupts near the finish line watch the video here @entity31 governor @entity30 flatly denied the claim , though that has not stopped conspiracy theorists from finding supposed proof that they believe backs up an alternate version of events			1
@entity39 of right - wing site @entity40 posited the loaded question , implying that the bombing was designed to increase federal authority			0
' why were the loud speakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bombs went off ? is this another false flag staged attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security while sticking their hands down our pants on the streets ? ' mr @entity39 said			1
though @entity60 governor @entity30 flatly denied the implication and moved on to the next question , that did n't stop conservative bloggers from running with the theory			0
the second of two explosions rocked the last 1050 yards of the @entity3 course , sending shrapnel into the crowd , severing limbs , and ending lives conspiracy theorists : @entity39 ( left ) asked governor @entity30 about the possibility of a false flag attack while fellow @entity40 writer @entity77 ( right ) continued to push the theory throughout the day wheels turning : @entity40 founder @entity77 pushed the ' false flag ' theory the sole alleged piece of evidence supporting the false flag theory is that several witnesses said that there was a recording over the loudspeaker just moments before the explosions that asked spectators to ‘ keep calm ’ and other reports that bomb sniffing dogs were used at the start of the race for a supposed training exercise			1
neither detail has been confirmed by investigators			0
@entity77 , the controversial radio show host and @entity99 who runs @entity40 and gained a national audience after having an on - air meltdown during an interview with @entity104 , followed @entity106 's lead and took to @entity107			0
' our hearts go out to those that are hurt or killed # @entity3 - but this thing stinks to high heaven # falseflag , ' he wrote			0
false flag attacks derive from nautical military strikes , where the crew on a ship would change the national flag to that of a friendly nation in order to approach its target and then attack			0
prior claims : other conspiracy theorists believed that the @entity125 shooting was designed by the government in order to help them pass stricter gun control laws now instead of limiting its use to naval warfare , conspiracy theorists apply it to any situation where a terrible act could be used by the perpetrators to influence a change in policy based off public outcry following the tragedy			1
prior to yesterday 's @entity143 bombing , the most recent example was the @entity125			0
gun rights advocates posited that the attack that left 20 children and six educators dead was planned by @entity149 administration officials in order to shore up support for stricter gun regulation			2
the conspiracy theorists have been able to disseminate their version of events largely because the federal authorities are still trying to compile theirs			1
different kind of flags : the term ' false flag ' comes from nautical warfare , where an attacker would use the flag of a friendly nation to trick the target into allowing them to approach no formal suspects have been identified , though the revelation that one of the bombs was located inside a pressure cooker - which is a preferred weapon of @entity173 terrorists and listed as the ' most effective ' weapon of jihad , according to in an @entity177 terror magazine - hinting that the perpetrator may be foreign			2
so far no terror groups have claimed responsibility			1
the @entity181 denied any connection to the attack , instead suggesting that it was an anti-islam conspiracy at work			1
@entity143 police are working with the @entity187 and are calling for the public ’s help in searching for the suspect , asking for any pictures or video taken near the finish line at around the time of the explosion to be sent in for analysis .			0

no suspects in custody and no terror groups have claimed responsibility
