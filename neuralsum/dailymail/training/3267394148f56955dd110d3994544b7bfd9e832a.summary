the head of @entity1 was accused yesterday of failing to get a grip on the ' chaotic ' scandal of shredded police corruption files			2
in a stuttering performance before mps , sir @entity5 admitted he did not even know how many documents had been destroyed			1
his extraordinary confession comes nearly two months after his officers found that potentially thousands of files from an internal probe were missing			0
the metropolitan police commissioner also revealed he had not asked to see a key memo that summarises the destroyed documents			2
yesterday @entity36 said a full parliamentary inquiry into the ' structure , governance and culture ' of the @entity21 would be launched by the home affairs committee			1
the @entity43 mp , who chairs the @entity45 panel , said sir @entity5 had yet to get a grip on the issue of the ' chaotic ' filing operation and his answers were not reassuring			2
he pointed out the @entity21 chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding operation on february 4 and it was now march 25			2
in his evidence sir @entity5 also told mps : revelations that the documents , gathered under @entity58 , were destroyed came in @entity60 's review of the @entity62 investigation , published on march 6			1
dark chapters : questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined investigations into the deaths of @entity62 , left , and @entity69 , right sir @entity5 was asked repeatedly if the shredding was malicious and corrupt			1
he could only reply : ' did the shredding happen ? it seems like it did			0
the question is about the motivation for the shredding			0
' there is an innocent one – it is a normal process of weeding and getting rid of documents – and there is a malicious one			0
what we have to establish is which one it is			0
' asked what is missing , he said : ' i just do n't know – that is what we are going to have to have an investigation to discover			0
' sir @entity5 said the shredding is now believed to have taken place in 2001 – not 2003 – as originally thought			2
a female officer had come forward with details of the destruction of the files , which was carried out when sir @entity5 was an assistant commissioner			2
under fire : met commissioner sir @entity5 was questioned by the home affairs committee today mps heard the @entity21 chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding operation on february 4 sir @entity5 , who told mr @entity36 it was a ' nonsense ' to think that an inquiry was needed , insisted the @entity21 was in good shape			1
but mps were left exasperated by sir @entity5 's failure to answer a series of key questions			1
they included whether the documents might have been shredded to comply with human rights law and data protection			0
asked repeatedly if this was the case , he could say only that : ' it is entirely possible '			0
there was astonishment when mr @entity36 asked whether sir @entity5 had read three key reports into possible corruption in the @entity21			1
he replied that he had read only part of one of the dossiers and had not seen the other files			0
@entity1 failed to act on death threats made against the mother of murdered teenager @entity62 , it was claimed last night			2
baroness @entity127 discussed the threats – believed to have been made on @entity129 – at a recent meeting with @entity21 chief sir @entity5 but nothing further has happened , the @entity126 heard			1
committee chairman @entity36 told sir @entity5 : ' she said she had a meeting with you , in which it was put to her that you had evidence of people making death threats against her			1
' this was done in the presence of a solicitor , yet nothing has happened as far as she can see with regards to anyone coming back to her about this very serious issue			0
' sir @entity5 replied that he would ' look into it immediately '			2
in a statement @entity1 said it contacted @entity127 's legal team soon after the meeting to access the @entity129 account , and that she was contacted directly a few days later			0
an investigating officer emailed the @entity153 on march 21 and 24 , it added			0
mr @entity36 also asked sir @entity5 if he had seen the devastating 2012 memo written by detective superintendent @entity155 that summarises the destroyed files			1
mr @entity36 said : ' could i ask have you seen the memo written by @entity155 ? ' sir @entity5 replied : ' i have n't			1
' mr @entity36 said : ' sir @entity5 , normally i find you very reassuring , i 'm afraid i do n't think we 're reassured at the moment			1
' disturbing questions now remain over whether corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the murders of @entity62 and private eye @entity69 in 1987			2
@entity62 's parents @entity167 and @entity168 have long feared that corruption played a part in the years of police failings over his racist murder in 1993			1
mr @entity69 's family believes the same network of officers shielded those behind the axe killing of the married father of two			0
yesterday sir @entity5 told @entity21 that the @entity21 should n't be involved in any future corruption investigation into a former detective called @entity181 , who worked on both murder inquiries			1
but he indicated that he is considering whether a sixth investigation should be started into the unsolved murder of mr @entity69 , who was said to have been preparing to expose police corruption when he was killed in a @entity187 pub car park			0
mr @entity189 's report found that an undercover police officer was working within the ' @entity191 ' in the late 90s as evidence was being taken for the judicial inquiry led by sir @entity194 into @entity62 's death			1
mr @entity189 found there is evidence to suspect mr @entity181 acted corruptly			0
it is claimed that he had links to @entity200 , the gangland boss father of @entity62 , one of the two men who were finally convicted in 2012 of the teenager 's racist murder			1
it is also claimed that mr @entity181 had links to the failed investigation into the death of mr @entity69 in @entity208			0
mr @entity181 disputes the allegations and has always denied them .			0

a ' lorry load ' of destroyed information relates to a corruption probe
the information could have shed light on @entity62 's murder
@entity21 commissioner @entity5 faced mps to *explain* shredding
but he admitted he did not know how many documents were destroyed
@entity126 chairman @entity36 remains *unconvinced* he has a grip on force
