turned the ' air blue : angry mother @entity15 and three - year - old daughter @entity7 with the hair bobble , left , and the effects of the dye on her hair , right offenders : the blue hair ties which ran while @entity27 was playing in the snow she has tried a variety of ways to clean the dye off - including using washing - up liquid to wash her hair - but they have all failed to work			1
the mother - of - two asked a hairdresser for advice , who told her the stubborn dye can only be removed by bleaching her daughter ’s hair - or chopping it off			1
furious @entity42 said she contacted high street discount store @entity43 - only for staff to tell her that the hair clips were n’t suitable for blondes			2

' i have tried everything and even contacted a hairdressers ’ for advice			0
' they said that i ’d either have to bleach @entity7 ’s hair or cut it			2
' there ’s no way i ’m going to bleach a three - year - old girl ’s hair so the only thing is to have it cut			1
' it would have to be cut very short to get rid of all the blue , so we might wait a bit which means she ’s stuck with it for now			0
' i called the store to complain but they were really snotty with me - one woman even said " what do you want me to do about it ? " ' i could n’t believe my ears when they told me the bobbles were n’t made for blonde children - how would i have known that ? streaks : parents and staff at the youngster 's nursery school thought that @entity7 's parents had died her hair deliberately @entity102 : mother @entity15 has washed her daughter 's hair 15 times since friday in a bid to get rid of the dye ' if there ’s that big a risk they should put a warning on the label			1
