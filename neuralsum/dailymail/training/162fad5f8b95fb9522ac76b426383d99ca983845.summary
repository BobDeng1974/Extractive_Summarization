with the most instinctive extension of his leg at the far post last night , @entity0 moved one step closer to immortality			1
this is how the really great goal scorers do it ; without fuss			0
it ’s their job and to people like @entity0 it comes naturally			1
in scoring the 15th goal of his remarkable @entity15 career , the @entity18 centre forward – on as a second half substitute – edged level with the @entity22 ronaldo at the top of the all - time table			0
perhaps just as importantly to him , he moved ahead of his compatriot , the great @entity26			0
goals : @entity61 51 , @entity0 71 @entity35 : @entity37 7 ; @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 ; @entity51 ( @entity66 51mins 6.5 ) , @entity67 6 , a @entity66 7.5 , @entity68 7 ( @entity69 71mins 6 ) ; @entity70 6 ( @entity71 77mins 6 ) ; @entity72 8 goals : @entity66 54 , @entity72 63 referee : @entity73 but , most importantly of all , @entity0 saved his team and his nation last night			1
reeling from a stunning @entity35 assault midway through the second half , @entity29 were trailing 2 - 1 in @entity78			1
for a few moments they looked as though they would join @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 in the @entity15 hall of shame			0
important players do important things , though , and when the big @entity18 defender @entity54 rose to flick on a corner 19 minutes from time , @entity0 was in the right place to earn his team a point			1
in recent times , @entity0 has replaced the somersault that used to follow his big goals with a simple pump of the fist			1
last night , though , the acrobatics were back			0
' i do n't know how long it ’s been since i did a somersault			0
but at least it worked out , ' he smiled afterwards			0
@entity0 now has 70 international goals to his name from 133 games			1
it is a remarkable record and he had been tied with @entity26 in the @entity15 list since he scored twice in a 4 - 0 quarter - final win over @entity112 four years ago in @entity113			0
level best : @entity114 ( right ) rises above the @entity18 defence to head home for @entity35 no chance : a full stretch @entity50 is unable to stop @entity114 equalising for @entity35 saviour : @entity114 celebrates scoring for @entity35 against @entity29 on saturday night these days , of course , he is not first choice			1
@entity124 ’s @entity123 is the modern go - to man and @entity0 perhaps arrived in @entity22 not expecting to see much action			1
this was his first appearance of the tournament and his goal came from pretty much his first touch			0
@entity29 needed it , too , as another night of gripping , unexpected drama threatened to provide us with one more upset			2
how odd that was , too , as @entity29 did look as though they were going to coast to the top of the group with maximum points after shading the first half and then taking the lead			1
the @entity18 midfield functioned brilliantly at times in the opening period with @entity147 ’s @entity59 imposing himself on the tournament for the first time after a quiet game against @entity151 and @entity58 looking the measured , astute passing footballer we know him to be			0
there were chances for the @entity18 during this time but they could n’t take them			0
they almost scored a super goal in the eleventh minute as a @entity123 back heel gave @entity58 the chance to shot			0
the ball may have found the corner , too , had it not struck a defender ’s shin			0
@entity58 and @entity59 were combining very well as the half progressed and the two of them created an opening for @entity56 in the 18th minute only for the goalkeeper to save			0
@entity59 then crossed low from the right for @entity123 who was denied by a tackle from @entity65			0
stunner : @entity72 fires past @entity50 to put @entity35 ahead against @entity29 dancing feet : @entity72 and his @entity35 team - mates celebrate in spectacular after going 2 - 1 up @entity178 was certainly building for @entity29 but for a while they could n’t break through			1
@entity58 shot over from distance and then @entity59 chipped a pass through for @entity41 , whose volley found the goalkeeper ’s midriff			2
@entity41 was eventually to score the opening goal but he had to wait until the 51st minute to do it			2
a cross from @entity123 deep on the right found the @entity124 player squeezing in between defenders and his header ended up in the net off his own right knee			0
in the lead at last , @entity29 looked set to consolidate as they often do			1
it did n’t happen , though , and three minutes later @entity35 caught them cold with an equaliser before taking the lead and turning the whole night on its head			1
again the cross came from the right for the equaliser and it was @entity114 who climbed above the static @entity52 to head powerfully to @entity50 ’s right and in to the corner			2
@entity206 : @entity68 tries to curl the ball around @entity53 as @entity35 search for a goal flexible : @entity211 spectacularly falls to the ground during @entity35 's game with @entity29 for @entity29 to concede one goal was careless but for them to concede again a few minutes later was criminal			1
this time they were architects of their own downfall as they gave the ball away in midfield and watched the superb @entity72 race away and score powerfully with his right foot			2
with @entity35 energised and full of adrenaline now , @entity29 all of a sudden looked a different team and the @entity225 poured forward			1
had the irrepressible @entity72 found the corner instead of @entity50 ’s midriff after flying down the left in the 66th minute then the game could have been over			2
as it was , @entity0 and @entity57 were sent on immediately and after the former scored the latter ambled forwards to head another chance over			2
in to the final stages and @entity29 could have won it			2
the breaking @entity123 was tackled brilliantly by @entity64 and then – two minutes in to added time – @entity0 spurned the chance to make history			0
with three weeks of this tournament to run , you would n’t bet against it happening would you ? bloodied : @entity123 goes down after a colliding with @entity65 of @entity35 ( not pictured ) down and out : @entity123 and @entity65 cllashed on the final whistle family affair : @entity29 's @entity51 ( left ) embraces his brother @entity244 before kick off			1

@entity29 had taken the lead through a @entity41 header
@entity114 equalised for @entity35 before @entity72 put them ahead
@entity0 equals @entity252 's record of 15 goals at @entity31
