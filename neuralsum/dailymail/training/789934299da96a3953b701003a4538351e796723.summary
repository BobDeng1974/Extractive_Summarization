the @entity9 playmaker , who broke @entity11 's hearts with a last - minute try and conversion in the semi-finals of the 2013 @entity15 , produced a man - of - the - match performance in the 2014 @entity18 final in @entity19 last month as the @entity20 defeated @entity21 to lift the title - a performance that impressed the 13 - man @entity3 voting panel			2
for the second successive year , @entity26 forward @entity6 - who swapped @entity29 for @entity30 in october - came second in the voting but , whereas 12 months ago @entity6 was within seven points of @entity33 , this time @entity0 was a decisive winner , collecting almost twice as many points as his nearest rival			1
@entity0 becomes only the fourth @entity37 to win the prestigious award , following in the footsteps of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1

to receive it is pretty unreal to be honest			0
' i felt i finished the year really well and was able to take that into the @entity18 and was really happy with how i played for the @entity20			0

' throughout the entire tournament he provided a devastating mix of organising the @entity2 side and producing moments of individual brilliance himself			2
