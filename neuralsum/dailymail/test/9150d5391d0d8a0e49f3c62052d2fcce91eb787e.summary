police are using tiny plastic @entity2 figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in @entity8			1
officers from @entity12 ’s @entity11 division – which has seen break - ins soar by nearly 40 per cent – posted pictures of the @entity2 models on their @entity17 page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime			1
last night , victims branded the move as ‘ insensitive ’ and ‘ a joke ’			2
hands up : plastic @entity2 figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking			1
but the move received a backlash , with victims branding it as ' a joke ' the police internet posting showed scenes of @entity2 criminals attempting to break into people ’s homes before being arrested by officers – and were accompanied by a @entity44 dialect poem giving advice			1
but the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes			1
break - ins in @entity11 rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to april 2014 , with 4,101 homes hit			1
across @entity8 , housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period			2
the row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations , rather than pounding the beat			1
last year , critics claimed many officers were having to ‘ backfill ’ – being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers			2
be vigilant : the @entity2 figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people 's homes			1
last night @entity12 defended the campaign last night , @entity12 defended the campaign , pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times			2
but @entity8 conservative chief whip @entity76 said : ‘ with housebreaking on the increase , officers should be out solving real crimes , rather than relying on @entity2 to try and prevent it			1
’ the pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive , @entity84			1
they were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city ’s housebreaking problem			2
one image shows a @entity2 figurine in a hat and standing beside a door			1
another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below			0
poems were posted alongside the pictures , with one reading : ‘ staying in or goin oot ? lock the windaes ‘ n ’ front door			1
a simple step maybe , that ’ll prevent access tae them on the chore			0
’ ‘ keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go , by usin ’ timers on lights ‘ n ’ even the radio , timers are cheap ‘ n ’ it takes seconds tae do , and it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue			0
’ ‘ look how ye get access tae the back o ’ yer hame , if it ’s easy others wull dae the same , restrict access tae the rear , and help prevent others fae choring yer gear			0
’ one victim of housebreaking , @entity132 from @entity134 , @entity11 , was not impressed			1
the 20 - year - old was alone in her home last july when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower			2
the man grabbed her from behind , punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape			0
speaking last night , she said police had done little to help her since the incident			0
‘ we had to keep phoning them [ @entity12 ] , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m still going to a psychiatrist and they ’re putting a lot of anxiety down to this			0
i was n’t sleeping for months			0
i did n’t feel safe at all			0
’ speaking about the online campaign , she said : ‘ they ’re [ people online ] not going to look at it and think , “ that ’s interesting ” and do anything about it			0
’ her father , @entity154 , added : ‘ why would they bother doing that ? @entity2 ? it ’s a joke			1
@entity12 is a waste of time			0
‘ it ’s a money - saving thing , obviously to the detriment of policing			0
get the guys back on the street			0
’ another housebreaking victim , @entity166 said the pictures were ‘ terrible ’ and ‘ insensitive ’			0
his house in the @entity171 area of @entity11 was broken into just before @entity172 , with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents , as well as his @entity177			2
mr @entity166 , whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident , said : ‘ could they not have used the resources elsewhere , rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with @entity2 sets ? ‘ when i saw that , i thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries			1
they have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on @entity17			2
’ watch out : the campaign was shared on social media with fun poems			0
pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling @entity11 's housebreaking problem he added : ‘ most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s			1
they do n’t have @entity17 or social media , so how are they supposed to get the message ? ’ chief supt @entity207 , @entity11 divisional commander , said : ‘ over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages			1
‘ social media is an important tool for communicating with the public			0
it allows us to provide vital information on crime prevention and advice on keeping safe			0
