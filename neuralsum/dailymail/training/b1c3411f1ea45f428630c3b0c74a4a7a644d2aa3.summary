by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 has used secret talks to urge @entity4 to face down opposition to his radical education reforms			1
the former @entity8 prime minister has held at least two meetings in recent months with the conservative education secretary urging him to press ahead in the face of criticism , including from the @entity8			1
the private support from such a surprising quarter has emboldened the @entity16 minister to go further in his plans to overhaul the @entity19 education system			2
mr @entity2 has also privately dismissed @entity21 's current education strategy as ' bunkum '			1
@entity16 education secretary @entity4 has been buoyed by the support of @entity23 @entity2 the disclosure of an alliance between the two men is likely to provoke deep unease in today ’s @entity8 , which has sought to turn mr @entity4 into public enemy number one			1
while mr @entity4 has previously confessed to being a @entity30 , it will prove highly controversial for mr @entity21 that his predecessor is offering advice to the @entity16			1
to add to the division mr @entity2 has previously dismissed @entity8 ’s current education policy of ‘ standards not structures ’ as empty rhetoric which failed to deliver results when he was in power			1
mr @entity2 is known to be an ardent supporter of mr @entity4 ’s academies programme , freeing schools from local authority control			1
bunkum : @entity8 's shadow education secretary @entity44 has said his policy is focused on ' standards not structures ' - something mr @entity2 has dismissed as pointless rhetoric he has also hailed free schools as a ‘ great idea ’ and accused the teaching unions of standing against ‘ necessary educational change ’			1
by contrast @entity44 , the current shadow education secretary in mr @entity21 ’s team , has condemned much of what mr @entity4 is doing			1
last week in a @entity57 debate mr @entity44 insisted : ‘ the first plank in @entity8 ’s schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures			1
‘ we do not think that the job is done simply because a school has changed its name to that of an academy or a free school			0
‘ we think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil , and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state - funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status			0
’ but mr @entity2 has already rubbished the ‘ standards not structures ’ mantra as a good soundbite which ignores the need for better structures to improve standards			1
writing in his 2010 autobiography @entity82 , mr @entity2 wrote : ‘ we had come to power in 1997 saying it was “ standards not structures ” that mattered			1
‘ this was fine as a piece of rhetoric ; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics			0
unfortunately , as i began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking , it was bunkum as a piece of policy			0
the whole point is that structures beget standards			2
how service is configured affects outcomes			0
’ in a major speech yesterday mr @entity4 set out plans to raise standards in state schools so they become indistinguishable from private schools			2
he suggested that a @entity108 state school @entity106 primary school in @entity108 - where most children are brought up with @entity19 as a foreign language - offers a better education than the private @entity112 attended by @entity113 and @entity114 just around the corner			0
mr @entity4 used a speech yesterday to set out plans to break down the ' @entity117 ' between state and private schools @entity8 's education spokesman @entity44 : ‘ the first plank in @entity8 ’s schools policy is to focus on standards and not structures			1
we think that the most important relationship is between a teacher and a pupil , and we would therefore ensure that all teachers in state - funded schools were qualified or working towards qualified teacher status			0
' january 2014 former @entity8 prime minister @entity2 : ‘ we had come to power in 1997 saying it was “ standards not structures ” that mattered ... this was fine as a piece of rhetoric ; and positively beneficial as a piece of politics			1
unfortunately , as i began to realise when experience started to shape our thinking , it was bunkum as a piece of policy			0
' september 2010 mr @entity4 vowed to ‘ break down the @entity117 ’ between state and private schools to drive up standards			2
he proposed state schools checking 13 - year - olds ’ progress by making them sit the common entrance exam , which is used by leading private schools to select pupils			0
the school day could be lengthened to up to 10 hours to improve academic performance and offer more activities including cadets , choir and sport			0
and he urged a return to old - fashioned discipline , including writing lines , sweeping up and removing graffiti			0
but once again mr @entity44 ’s response to the wide - ranging speech focussed on @entity8 ’s policy that every teacher should be qualified and registered			0
he said : ‘ improving school standards starts with a qualified teacher in every classroom			0
until @entity4 commits to this , he is ruling himself out of any serious debate about how we raise standards in our schools			2
’ a source close to mr @entity4 : ‘ @entity44 is turning out to be a one - trick pony			0
he ’s got nothing to say on the longer school day , discipline or rigour			0
‘ instead he trots out the same hypocritical policy on teacher qualifications that would deny ordinary kids at state school the top class education he enjoyed			2
’ mr @entity4 is not the only @entity184 member of the government linked to mr @entity2			2
@entity186 , the chancellor , was reported to have referred to mr @entity2 as ' the master ' and used his memoir as a reference book for reform .			2

*ex-labour* *pm* has held two meetings with @entity16 education secretary
@entity2 backs free schools , academies and taking on the unions
@entity21 's policy has focused on ' standards not structures '
but in his memoirs @entity2 dismissed this ' rhetoric ' which ignored reality
