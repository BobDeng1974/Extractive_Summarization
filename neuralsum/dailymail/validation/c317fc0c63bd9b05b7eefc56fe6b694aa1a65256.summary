yesterday , the @entity0 published a poignant photograph of actress @entity3 's family , showing how cancer has claimed the lives of many of her relatives , including her mother , aunt and grandmother			1
her mother , the actress @entity12 , died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007			0
her grandmother @entity16 died of cancer aged 45 and her aunt @entity19 - her mother 's sister - lost her battle with the disease at 61			2
this strong family history comes from a mutation of the @entity25 gene , which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer			1
this comes two years after a preventative double mastectomy because of her raised risk of breast cancer			2
but while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited , what is less well known is that it 's not just down the female line ; the risk can be passed on from your father 's side of the family , too			1
@entity54 , a 44 - year - old commercial manager from @entity55 , inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty @entity25 gene			1
' i never knew you could inherit a breast and ovarian cancer gene from a male relative , ' she says			2
she only became aware of the faulty @entity25 gene in her family tree last june , after suddenly hearing from her father @entity70 , 68 , a retired teacher , after years of little contact			1
' i received a text from my dad saying : " can we talk ? " ' she says			2
her parents divorced when she was four and her mother brought her up with her sister @entity76 , 40 , and brother @entity77 , 39			0
' when i phoned my dad that evening , he explained that my cousin - his sister 's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer , and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty @entity25 gene , ' she says			1
@entity54 inherited the ovarian cancer gene from her father ' my aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s			1
after my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40 , the rest of that side of my dad 's family went for genetic testing			1
' that 's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene			1
' @entity54 's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer , and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer			1
he was concerned that the faulty gene could have been passed to his children			2
' i was aware of the @entity25 connection because i had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer , ' says @entity54			1
' but i assumed it was something related to women and did n't know it could be passed by men , too			0
' it 's a common misconception , says dr @entity113 , a gynaecological oncologist at @entity114			2
' unfortunately , many women and some doctors disregard the paternal side of the family			0
they do n't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father 's side , so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk			1
' we all inherit two copies of every gene - one from our mother and one from our father			2
so if either parent has a mutant copy , a child has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it			0
assuming it 's just the mother 's line that you need to worry about is an understandable mistake , says dr @entity113 , as these genes tend to cause female cancers			2
' however , they are not passed down on the female sex chromosome , like some inherited diseases			2
men carry them just as easily as women , ' he says			0
' but women are more vulnerable to the effects			0
' while a faulty brca gene raises a man 's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent , they raise a woman 's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent , and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent			1
' no one knows why the risk is higher in women , but it may relate to female hormones acting with the faulty gene to promote cancer , ' says dr @entity113 , who is also consultant gynaecologist at @entity173 , @entity174			2
he says it 's crucial people are aware of any history of cancer in their family			2
' men need to be careful not to disregard their mother 's side of the family in the same way women should not ignore their father 's side , ' he says			0
' if you 're in any doubt about the implications of a pattern of cancers in your family , discuss it with your gp			0
they can refer you for genetic testing			0
' after hearing the news from her father , @entity54 contacted her brother and sister , warning them they needed to be checked			1
her gp put her on a waiting list to have genetic testing			0
her father had waited almost ten months to be tested , but @entity54 did n't want to wait this long			1
' i was 43 , which felt quite old to find out you have faulty @entity25 , ' she says			1
' the thought of it kept me awake at night			0
my fear was that i might already have cancer - i knew ovarian cancer was notoriously hard to diagnose			0
' it led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain , bloating and nausea after eating , as well as feeling full quicker			1
@entity54 paid Â£ 700 to have a test at a private screening clinic , which involved giving a blood sample			1
there are hundreds of different mutations of the @entity25 gene , but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis			1
three weeks later , @entity54 went back with her husband @entity237 to be told her test results			1
' i had a bad feeling from the outset , ' says @entity54			1
' but when the gene counsellor said i had the defective gene , i began to cry			0
i knew from that moment that my life was on a different path			0
i texted my dad and family straight away with my news			0
' @entity54 was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer			1
but for reasons experts do not fully understand , in her family the mutant gene more commonly manifested itself as ovarian cancer in the female line and prostate cancer in men			0
women with a faulty @entity25 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy			1
there is no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer			0
@entity54 quickly decided what she wanted to do			1
' my close friend who had the faulty brca gene relied solely on annual breast screening			0
she did n't make it			0
i wanted to take away any risk of getting either cancer through surgery while i still could			0
' in september , she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by dr @entity113			1
examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells			1
' i felt it confirmed that i had made the right decision in pushing to have surgery as soon as possible , ' says @entity54			2
' no one could have said when the cells would have turned into something more serious			0
' two months later , she underwent a double mastectomy , with surgeons using tissue from her stomach to form new breasts			0
the breast tissue was found to be clear of cancerous cells			0
a report published a few months ago in the @entity299 found more widespread genetic testing for cancer - causing mutations would save lives and reduce the amount spent on treating cancers			0
the @entity306 , the @entity307 charity dedicated to gynaecological cancer research , is calling for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer to be tested for faulty brca genes			0
chief executive @entity312 says it would increase experts ' understanding of these cancers and allow women to warn their family members , too			0
though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing , @entity54 's sister heard shortly before @entity321 that she , too , has the defective gene			1
she will undergo the same surgery as @entity54			2
' i have thanked my cousin for alerting us , ' says @entity54			2
' i 've been able to take action to protect myself from cancer			0

@entity54 , 44 , from @entity55 , inherited @entity25 gene from her dad
she then had a mastectomy and her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed
@entity3 last week revealed she 's had the same surgeries
