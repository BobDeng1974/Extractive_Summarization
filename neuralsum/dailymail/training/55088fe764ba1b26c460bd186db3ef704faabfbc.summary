no @entity1 wedding would be complete without an extreme pre-nup in case of an unhappy ending			0
but while most pre-wedding contracts are drawn up to protect spouses in cases of wandering hands or financial misdemeanours , controlling @entity10 is said to have demanded a clause banning his wife - to - be from having any more surgery			1
according to reports in this week 's @entity20 magazine the musician , whose mother died on the operating table , hit the roof when he saw messages between @entity23 and her surgeons discussing her next bout of body maintenance			1
and so the 36 - yr - old demanded @entity23 refrain from ' lipo , botox , another nose job			1
' this will be a bitter pill to swallow for the 33 - year - old reality star who has seemingly spent years perfecting her face			1
fortunately one of the ways that @entity23 maintains her youthful looks does n't have anything to do with a doctor 's scalpel			2
@entity23 's face has changed dramatically since she first hit the headlines in 2006 ( left ) but now her future husband @entity10 has banned her from anymore surgery since she first hit the headlines in 2006 @entity23 's face has changed dramatically and her rising hairline has been the source of constant speculation			1
while some have hinted at a full hairline lift , a painful and expensive procedure that can leave scarring , most experts agree that @entity23 has used laser surgery on her forehead to remove hair and give her a new hairline			1
surgeon @entity59 , hair loss expert on @entity63 medical show @entity64 , said that @entity23 has almost certainly had the ' baby hair ' from the front of her hairline removed			1
he said this can be done temporarily by waxing or more permanently through laser removal			0
dr @entity59 , from the @entity71 hair transplant centre in @entity72 , agreed : ' it is very likely that @entity23 has had the baby hairs around hairline removed			1
@entity23 , pictured here in 2007 and 2008 , has transformed her hairline over the years and experts claim that she has undergone laser hair removal ' this can be done by waxing - a similar procedure to how women remove hair from their legs or bikini line			1
' but it is more likely that @entity23 has opted for laser surgery , a more permanent form of removal			1
' dr @entity59 , @entity89 's leading hair transplant surgeon specialises in female hair treatments and is the first surgeon in the @entity89 to perform an @entity93 transplant			2
he added that around 10 % of women have facial hair removal - most commonly on the upper lip and chin			1
but hair removal around the hairline as may have happened to @entity23 is much rarer			1
he said the procedure was still fairly uncommon but publicity around celebrities was sure to increase demand because many women would have been previously unaware that there was a solution to the problem			2
he explained : ' this kind of procedure around the hairline is much less common			0
obviously some women - particularly celebrities - are very sensitive about their appearances and may feel hair growth in this area is a little unfeminine			2
' the baby hair can be removed permanently in around four to six laser surgery sessions lasting around 30 minutes to an hour each time			0
prices start at around £ 50 a session in the @entity89 , though treatments at top clinics in @entity122 are considerably more expensive			0
dr @entity59 said : ' it is relatively straight - forward procedure that can be done in the lunch - hour with very quick recovery time			1
' laser treatment will remove hair permanently in four to six sessions - the key is to catch the hair follicle throughout all of its growth cycles			0
on monday @entity23 was in @entity134 with her sister @entity136 ' it is fairly painless , as pulses of light from the laser of a pre-determined wavelength pass down the hair follicle and kill it at the root , preventing re-growth , without any sort of damage to the rest of the body			2
it is a proven , extremely popular treatment , that can remove unwanted hair permanently from anywhere on the body			0
' the procedure is carried out by a fully qualified esthetician			0
the laser works specifically to attack hair by travelling through the pigment in the hair , down to the root , where the energy is absorbed by the bulb			0
during this process the follicle gets killed and stops producing hair			0
' due to the way the body works and produces hair , you will typically need more than one session per course of treatments as the hair grows in cycles , so you can not ' catch ' and disable all follicle in one treatment			0
you will find that following each session , you will be able to go about your daily business as per usual , without any negative laser hair removal side effects			1
' the discomfort during a laser hair removal treatment is minimal			1
laser hair removal patients can opt to use soothing cream to minimize discomfort in the most sensitive areas			1
most patients say it is far less painful than waxing			0
' the ' no - surgery ' pre-nup clause will see @entity23 suffer a financial penalty of around $ 500,000 if the couple divorce			1
as well as banning @entity23 from having surgery musician @entity10 is also insisting that the mother of his child stop her mother @entity195 from interfering with their private and professional lives			1
@entity23 and @entity10 recently welcomed @entity198 to their family 2006 : at @entity201 ( left ) and 2007 : during an @entity203 appearance ( right ) 2010 : on a trip to @entity205 ( left ) and 2011 : during a fragrance launch ( right ) 2008 : a new fringe at a @entity122 premiere ( left ) and 2009 : at a @entity210 party in @entity211 ( right ) 2012 : at a @entity213 party ( left ) and 2013 : at the @entity215 show in @entity216 ( right ) sustained @entity218 use gives the appearance of an elongated forehead @entity222 - @entity221 , non-surgical director at @entity224 * believes that @entity23 's love of @entity218 may also have had an effect on her hairline			1
she says : ' looking at the images of @entity23 , it appears to me that her shiny , line - free , elongated forehead is showing classic telltale signs of recent and long term @entity218 use			2
' @entity23 is in danger of looking over done , with her skin beginning to look too taut and shiny			0
regular use of @entity218 , with what appears to also be work on the eyebrows , and the tidying up of her hair , gives the appearance of a higher hairline			0
' many celebrities are keen @entity218 users and many also have this shiny , elongated look			0
a good example is @entity247			0
' it ’s unusual for either men or women to request to have their hairline higher , in fact , it ’s quite the opposite – many people look to reduce the appearance of a large forehead or hair recession			2
' @entity23 undoubtedly looks great and is loved by many women wanting to look good and stop the signs of ageing			2
a combination of @entity218 , dermal fillers in the cheek area , regular non-surgical treatments and fantastic contouring by her make - up artist has resulted in this smooth appearance			0
' we would always recommend that less is more			0
once you ’ve reached the stage where you ’ve achieved the appearance you want , you should leave more time between treatments , and also minimise the amount of product you are having injected			0
you should always seek the advice of a qualified aesthetician or doctor , so that you can achieve a natural look without looking overdone and unnatural			0
