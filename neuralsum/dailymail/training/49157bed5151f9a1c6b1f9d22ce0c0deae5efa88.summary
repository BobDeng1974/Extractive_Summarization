@entity1 captain @entity0 has demanded his team - mates show ‘ personality ’ to prevent their @entity4 disaster against @entity5 turning into a full - blown crisis			1
@entity0 watched in near disbelief as @entity1 had @entity9 and @entity10 sent off in an embarrassing 2 - 1 defeat at an eerily quiet @entity12 on wednesday night			1
once again , they gave a performance in @entity15 that was a far cry from their domestic form			2
city are bottom of @entity20 and need maximum points from their remaining fixtures against @entity23 and @entity24 to stand any realistic chance of qualifying for the knockout stages			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 looks dejected after @entity1 's shock defeat to @entity5 @entity0 has demanded his team - mates show ' personality ' to avoid a @entity4 disaster ‘ everyone will jump on the bandwagon , but i am going to go the other way and say i still believe in my team , and still back everyone at this club 100 per cent to turn it around , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but personality will have to show in the next games , otherwise we will have to wait another year			2
’ unfortunately for @entity1 , a number of factors suggests just such a wait lies in store			1
@entity45 in a muddle manager @entity47 was dignified post-match , refusing to blame referee @entity49 for his team ’s poor result			1
the @entity52 knows @entity1 ’s failings went beyond one hapless official and tactically he must accept blame			1
allowing his team to be overrun in midfield was naive given that one key central player , @entity10 , is already a loose cannon when it comes to holding position and tracking back			0
@entity47 must shoulder blame after @entity1 were stunned by their @entity65 opponents the plans against @entity5 were a mess			1
@entity68 was expected to stop @entity70 ’s counter-attacks almost single - handedly while @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity10 ineffectually stood by			0
he sent on @entity9 at half - time to rectify the problem but then gambled by taking @entity68 off for @entity75 — again leaving only one natural holder			0
@entity9 ’s red card compounded the error			0
toure in turmoil for so long an idol , @entity10 has developed into a caricature of a sulky footballer this season			0
already booked , his pointless shove on @entity86 in the second half saw him get a straight red card and follow @entity9 down the tunnel			0
it killed any @entity1 prospects of salvaging a draw			1
at least the @entity93 had the self - awareness to apologise			0
his younger brother died of cancer during the @entity100 and the racial abuse he has received on @entity102 is disturbing and unpleasant			0
@entity10 saw red for a shove on @entity5 's @entity86 to end hope of a fightback yet in this kind of form he is a liability			1
his lack of positional discipline and desire to track back made the job for central midfield partner @entity68 impossible			0
we never really got to the bottom of the birthday cake debacle , when @entity10 was allegedly seething that @entity1 ’s @entity119 owners had n’t marked his birthday with due respect			1
the suspicion is that he was trying to engineer a move back to @entity124			0
when @entity124 failed to show much interest , he pledged his loyalty to @entity1 rather unconvincingly			1
fans turning off when @entity1 were struggling in the third tier of @entity131 football , their supporters were known as the best in the country			2
but now they are among @entity15 ’s elite , there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the @entity12 compared to @entity138 or @entity139			0
after seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against @entity24 , @entity1 allowed fans to buy two - for - one against @entity5			1
it swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere.the first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval when they were 2 - 1 down			0
@entity150 endured a nightmare against @entity70 as @entity1 's @entity4 hopes were left in tatters @entity150 conundrum @entity150 joined @entity1 from @entity155 , presumably for much higher wages			1
but some of his defending against @entity5 was distracted to the point of being ridiculous			2
he conceded the free - kick that allowed @entity160 to head the opener for @entity5			2
even worse , after @entity10 had equalised , @entity150 hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent			0
three touches later , @entity160 had restored @entity70 ’s lead			0
executive stress they ca n’t avoid some degree of responsibility , from @entity171			0
their historic breaking of @entity172 regulations means @entity47 has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the @entity4			1
@entity176 and @entity177 have been loaned out because there is no room for them , leaving @entity47 having to chase four trophies with just three strikers			2
@entity47 has been left short in attack after @entity176 was loaned out to @entity184 he has said @entity185 and @entity186 were never options because @entity1 could n’t afford the transfer fees or wages under the @entity172 restrictions			1
the @entity15 effect @entity15 ’s governing body might deny it but their rules have made it far more difficult for @entity1 to compete			2
for @entity1 to be seeded lower than @entity155 , and therefore given a harder @entity4 group , is ridiculous given that they won the @entity196 and @entity155 finished fourth			1
their fans were banned from the away game in @entity70 while @entity5 supporters seemed to sneak in			2
... on the bright side @entity1 have been here before in both title - winning seasons			1
they were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed and came out on @entity207 through , second spot is still up for grabs			0
victory against the @entity210 would set up a likely winner - takes - all meeting away to @entity24			0
@entity213 admits players are nervous in @entity15			0

@entity1 's @entity4 hopes are in tatters after *losing* to @entity5
@entity47 's men are six points behind @entity221 in title race
@entity1 have won just once in their last five outings in all *competitions*
@entity1 face @entity227 away in @entity196 at *5.30pm* on *saturday*
