@entity0 is openly defying the @entity1 , insisting that ' the structure of sanctions has cracked and its collapse has started			1
' the statement from @entity6 came thursday night via the state - run @entity8 news service , even as a top @entity11 official sought to reassure the world that ' the sanctions pressure on @entity0 will continue to mount			1
' @entity0 walked out of talks in @entity15 designed to implement a deal struck on nov. 24 , following the @entity19 administration 's decision to take a hard line on enforcing sanctions against companies that assist @entity6 with its nuclear program			1
treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence @entity27 claimed in wednesday 's @entity28 that ' @entity0 will be even deeper in the hole six months from now when the deal expires than it is today			0
' but @entity0 maintained that its crude oil sales ' will be maintained at the current level and @entity0 ’s oil revenues will also be released			0
' no guarantees : secretary of state @entity35 has sidestepped questions about the nuclear deal with @entity0 , telling @entity38 that he ca n't promise what the outcome will be big problem : @entity0 's @entity43 nuclear facility is home to the nation 's enrichment of plutonium , which is used for nuclear weapons but has no peaceful purpose ' sanctions on @entity0 ’s petrochemical sector will be completely removed and the sanctions on the country ’s auto industry will also be lifted , ' the @entity51 's regime claimed			1
the @entity57 cut a deal with @entity6 in @entity15 last month that dangled the carrot of sanctions relief on the condition that @entity0 keep its end of a bargain that would temporarily curtail its nuclear program and open its facilities to inspectors			1
a limited set of sanctions , however , have already been put on track for a rollback			0
@entity71 , the top @entity1 nuclear negotiator , said thursday in a @entity74 hearing that ' between $ 6 - 7 billion ' in relief was agreed to in the @entity76 between @entity0 and the @entity78 nations , which include the @entity1 , the @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity83			2
through his government - controlled news agency , @entity0 president @entity84 has insisted that his nation will escape from @entity1 's harsh sanctions regime and regain access to much of its international trade program the sanctions relief represents a ' modest fraction of the approximately $ 100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible or restricted , ' @entity92 assured the senators			1
but the crack in the international community 's previously rigid position has given @entity0 room to made sweeping claims			2
a group of @entity1 senators led by @entity105 democrat @entity104 is busily preparing legislation that would ramp up sanctions , not relax them , if @entity0 renegs on its nuclear agreement in the next six months			2
the @entity109 has tried to wave lawmakers off , saying that its negotiations will maintain enough pressure on @entity0 to ensure its compliance with the nuclear restrictions it accepted			2
over objections from @entity6 , the @entity19 administration moved on thursday to blacklist 19 companies and individuals linked to @entity0 's nuclear program			1
' @entity120 reached in @entity15 does not , and will not , interfere with our continued efforts to expose and disrupt those supporting @entity0 ’s nuclear program or seeking to evade our sanctions , ' @entity27 said in a statement			1
after the @entity1 announced the move , @entity6 abruptly broke off talks			0
one diplomat told @entity129 that @entity0 negotiators said ' they had received instructions from @entity6 to stop the discussions and fly back to @entity6			2
' the @entity109 hopes aggressive enforcement of existing sanctions will help persuade @entity38 to take a wait - and - see attitude instead of embracing a new round of sanctions in the near future			1
distraction # 1 : the @entity1 has paid for billboards throughout the @entity143 world promising a reward for information leading to the return from @entity0 of @entity147 , who was outed this week as a @entity150 asset operating in @entity0 distraction # 2 : a @entity153 newspaper published a claim in november that president @entity19 was looking for a way to visit @entity6 relaxing sanctions on businesses that sell cars , airplane parts , petrochemicals and precious metals , worried @entity163 sources told @entity164 , could allow @entity6 to stockpile enough supplies and sell enough material to sustain it for more than a decade if sanctions should tighten in the future			1
' we 're worried that if @entity0 can suddenly buy aircraft parts , and then we shut off that spigot six months from now , they will already have had enough time to warehouse enough material to outlast whatever we might throw at them next , ' a senior @entity171 @entity74 aide said			0
and critics worry that @entity0 could sell gold and oil in sufficient volume to fund whatever nuclear ambitions it secretary harbors			0
' think of it this way , ' former @entity184 administration @entity183 official @entity182 said in an email			0
' @entity0 has a bowl of popcorn , a popcorn machine and kernels , but they 're broke			0
' ' we 've just given them some money in exchange for the bowl of popcorn			0
they 've still got the machine and the kernels			0
they can always make more popcorn			0

@entity0 recalled its negotiators from @entity15 after the @entity1 moved to blacklist companies that help @entity6 build its nuclear program
the @entity109 is suddenly talking tough on enforcement as @entity38 *threatens* to upset the apple cart with a new round of sanctions
@entity0 's state - run news agency immediately insisted that ' the collapse ' of all sanctions ' has started '
the @entity19 administration insists that the limited relief it has offered @entity0 is ' a modest fraction ' of the *penalties* already in place
but *observers* worry that opening the door a crack will allow @entity0 to sidestep future sanctions by stockpiling needed materials all at once
