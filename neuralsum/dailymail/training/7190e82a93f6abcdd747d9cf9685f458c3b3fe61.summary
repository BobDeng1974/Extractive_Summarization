by @entity0 more has been spent on rebuilding @entity1 than the entire cost of lifting @entity3 from the ruins of the @entity5 , according to a @entity7 government report published yesterday			2
corruption and waste have pushed the price of reconstructing @entity1 to more than £ 62billion – and exceeding the amount the @entity12 provided under the @entity13			2
named after @entity7 secretary of state @entity15 , the 1948 scheme provided $ 13billion – the equivalent of £ 61billion today – over four years and helped rebuild 16 @entity3 countries			1
corruption and waste : endemic corruption and waste have been blamed for the the country 's international aid bill , which has exceeded £ 61.7billion ( $ 104billion ) in the 13 years since the @entity23 were overthrown yet despite the money spent in @entity1 , it remains mired in a political crisis and is likely to remain dependent on donors for years to come even as @entity28 and other foreign troops prepare to withdraw at the end of the year			1
development projects meant to provide @entity1 with a sound structural foundation have cost @entity7 taxpayers £ 61.5billion and @entity28 a further £ 890million			1
but in a report presented to @entity35 this week , @entity36 , the @entity37 , says most of the projects he audited were hampered by ‘ poor planning , shoddy construction , mechanical failures and inadequate oversight ’			0
huge clean up : by contrast , the @entity45 's initiative to aid @entity3 following the end of the @entity5 - amounted to about £ 60.5billion ( $ 102billion ) at today 's prices out of time : in five months , the mission changes from a military operation to a relatively small ' advise and assist ' initiative - and most of the remaining allied soldiers will leave he calculates that ‘ by the end of 2014 , the @entity7 will have committed more funds to reconstruct @entity1 , in inflation - adjusted terms , than it spent on 16 @entity3 countries after the @entity5 under the @entity13 ’			1
the 259 - page report includes a photograph of a pile of school chairs in @entity63 province that have been stripped to the metal so the wood could be burned for heat			0
billions were spent on ill - fated agricultural and infrastructure projects that failed to take into account @entity1 ’s terrain and culture , said the report			0
expensive : almost two - thirds of @entity7 's investment in @entity1 's reconstruction has been funneled into building its military and police forces building : the @entity1 government approved £ 4.5billion ( $ 7.6billion ) in spending this fiscal year , despite anticipated revenue of £ 1.6billion ( $ 2.8billion ) more than £ 2billion was spent ‘ improving ’ the @entity1 police yet tens of thousands of ‘ ghost ’ officers collect their pay but never turn up			2
nearly half of the 747,000 firearms provided for @entity1 security forces have vanished			0
the report says the annual cost of maintaining @entity1 ’s police and military is likely to be double what the country collects in tax revenue .			0

by contrast , the @entity13 amounted to £ 60.5billion at today 's prices
