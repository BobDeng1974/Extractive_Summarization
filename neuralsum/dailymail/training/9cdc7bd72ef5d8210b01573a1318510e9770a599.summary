the race is on to build a self - driving car that can negotiate difficult driving conditions , with auto manufacturers trialling a number of different technologies			2
and now @entity6 has revealed it is testing autonomous cars that can slide round corners at high speeds , with the sort of precision it takes racing drivers years to perfect			1
the @entity16 car company ’s new prototype cars use ‘ advanced technology to demonstrate maximum safety up to the car ’s dynamic limit , ’ by enabling them to negotiate turns and obstacles at high speeds			2
@entity6 has revealed it is testing autonomous cars that can slide round corners - or ' drift ' - at high speeds , with the precision it takes racing driver years to perfect @entity6 showed off a modified 2 - @entity29 and 6 - @entity30 sporting its latest technology , at the 2014 @entity32 in @entity33			1
both cars are fitted with a lidar system - a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analysing the reflected light - 360 degree radar , ultrasonic sensors and cameras that track the environment , enabling them to make driving decisions			1
@entity6 showed off a modified 2 - @entity29 ( pictured right ) and 6 - @entity30 ( pictured left ) sporting its latest technology , at the 2014 @entity32 in @entity33 sensors monitoring road conditions as well as picking up other data feed information to the car 's computer so that it can make autonomous decisions			1
understeer – where the car pushes over its front wheels – is controlled by ‘ opening ’ the steering and a sliding rear end ( oversteer , which is used to drift ) is caught using a carefully gauged combination of countersteering and brake inputs			0
this allows a driver to slide around a corner at speed but also in safety			0
the programmable electronic steering required to make this possible carries out carefully targeted and rapid adjustments such as braking at the perfect time			0
these technologies , coupled with electric braking , throttle and steering control that comes with all new @entity76 , means that the cars can change lanes , slide round corners and even perform a slalom at high speeds without any intervention from the driver			1
@entity6 said : ‘ the prototype can pilot its way at high speeds and with exceptional precision on a slalom run between cones , adheres to a marked out circular course regardless of the friction coefficient of the road surface and executes an obstacle - evading lane change to perfection			1
’ the fact that the cars are able to ‘ drift ’ by themselves has excited motoring enthusiasts , as it is a tricky technique used by professional drivers who intentionally oversteer so that the rear tyres slip but they maintain control of the car			0
this move enables them to take corners quickly and efficiently			0
while the technology will excite would - be racers , it could help people in dangerous driving conditions such as aquaplaning to give a regular driver the skills of an expert			2
here a demonstrator keeps his hands on his lap as the car takes a corner at high speed the fact that the cars are able to ' drift ' by themselves ( pictured ) has excited motoring enthusiasts , as it is a tricky technique used by professional drivers who intentionally oversteer so that the rear tyres slip but they maintain control of the car to take corners quickly ‘ even when deliberately provoked into oversteer – the clearest way of highlighting a vehicle ’s dynamic limit – the highly automated prototype follows its path safely and along almost identical lines time after time , ’ the car company said			0
while the technology will excite would - be racers , it could help people in dangerous driving conditions off the track			0
it would give a regular driver the skills of an expert when aquaplaning , for example			0
the cars constantly factor in the condition of a road surface to respond intelligently and @entity6 has tested them on the famous @entity151 circuit			0
look , no hands ! the new autonomous technologies , coupled with electric braking throttle and steering control that comes with all new @entity76 , means that the cars can change lanes , slide round corners and even perform a slalom at high speeds without any intervention from the driver the intelligent systems actively intervene in the direction - changing , decision - making process and @entity6 says its technology goes ‘ a crucial step further than current systems ’ that which react to the onset of understeer or oversteer with carefully calculated braking inputs , to keep drivers safely on the road			1
@entity6 is testing the high - speed autonomous system as it believes only one that can master all driving situations will gain the trust of the public			2
the cars are fitted with a @entity181 system , 360 - degree radar , ultrasonic sensors , and cameras that track the environment , enabling then to make driving decisions and the driver to put his hands in the air ( pictured )			1

@entity6 's modified 2 - @entity29 and 6 - @entity30 went on show at the 2014 @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in @entity33
both cars are fitted with a lidar system , radar , sensors and cameras that track the environment , enabling them to make driving decisions
the cars can change lanes , slide round corners and even perform a slalom at high speeds without any intervention from the driver
