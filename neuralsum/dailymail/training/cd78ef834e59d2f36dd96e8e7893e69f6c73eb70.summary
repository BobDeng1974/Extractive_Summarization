by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:20 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:01 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 has a new mascot - in the shape of a newly - formed volcanic island in the likeness of cartoon dog @entity8			1
the island , off the country 's @entity9 , rose from the sea over the past few weeks as a massive undersea volcano erupted and spewed out magma which cooled to create the new land mass. by @entity16 , the island 620 miles south of @entity18 had expanded and it has now linked with existing @entity21 island			1
new island : in this aerial image , a new islet is seen connected with @entity21 island in @entity26 , @entity3 spot the difference : the island bears an uncanny resemblance to @entity8 after aerial photographs of the two islands were released , @entity31 users pointed out how much they resembled @entity35 's faithful companion			1
the likeness to @entity38 's creation is realised even further as a pool of reddish seawater , in between the two islands , looks like @entity8 's collar			2
the @entity42 reports experts say the volcano is still active and there is the possibility it will continue to change shape as the magma continues to rise			0
the long - term future of the island is unclear and there has been specualtion over whether @entity53 will claim the island			1
at the moment , it is part of the @entity26 chain			0
@entity8 : @entity35 and his dog @entity8 whose likeness has been spotted in the new island the @entity62 could soon be getting a new island too			0
a series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the @entity67 in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow			0
the largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of @entity73 - the smallest island in the @entity62 - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches			1
if the volcano was to erupt , the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the canary chain			2
it would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated			0
@entity73 itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high .			0

@entity91 is off @entity3 's @entity9 and has been created over weeks
the islet , 620 miles south of @entity18 , is linked with @entity21 island
the long - term future of the island is unclear
