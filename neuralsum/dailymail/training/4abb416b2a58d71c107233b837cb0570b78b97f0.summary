a photographer is challenging society 's views about what makes a glamorous model by transforming real women into beautiful pin - ups			1
@entity8 native @entity7 founded @entity9 in 2009 , with the aim of helping women to ' feel safe , beautiful , and empowered ' and has since photographed dozens of subjects			1
' doing this work has transformed my life , ' ms @entity7 told @entity17			1
' i 've met the most amazing people , and they 've been brave enough to share their fears and dreams with me , and to have that become part of the photographs			2
' you 'd be amazed how many truly beautiful people have no idea that they 're beautiful , and it has a huge affect on what they feel is possible for their lives			2
' the @entity49 graduate hopes that her photographs will inspire other women to embrace their own beauty , rather than shying away from the cameras or the spotlight			2
she insists that nobody should not feel as though models and actors are the only people allowed to enjoy the limelight , and during each shoot , she encourages her subjects to embrace an aspect of role play and fantasy			2
' the tools of makeup , lighting , and photography can create images that are part fantasy , part reality , ' she explains on her website			2
' it is a powerful thing to enter the realm of fantasy , and to know that you can do so whenever you choose			0
no model or movie star owns the realm of fantasy - we all do			1
anything is possible : the shameless photography team have worked with women from all over the world on a variety of stunning images be yourself : the pin - up shoots are aimed at inspiring women to embrace their own bodies and their own beauty , rather than aspiring to look like someone else fantasy v reality : according to ms @entity7 , a lot of women feel that actors and models are the only people who can have fun with fantasy or role play			1
she wants to change that perception the perfect bombshell : ms @entity7 explains on her website that everyone , ' no matter what shape , size , age , color , or ability ' can be a model ' in some small way , we hope that our business can help women to feel more empowered and embodied - and to see femininity as a space of play and possibility rather than shame			1
' so in order to ensure that every model feels entirely comfortable and confident during their shoot , ms @entity7 and her team offer a variety of additional services to help each and every person truly step into the pin - up role			1
' we ’re in this to prove that you can be a bombshell , no matter what shape , size , age , color , or ability , ' the website adds			0
' we ’re here to help every step of the way - from wardrobe to makeup to hair styling to pose and expression coaching - so that you can see your own beauty more clearly			1
' @entity9 also operates an annual @entity146 , which is currently in its fourth year			1
the competition sees women from around the world writing love letters to their own bodies , which are then posted onto the company 's @entity153 page , in the hopes of winning the chance to take part in a shameless photoshoot			1
video from @entity160 light up : the women in ms @entity7 's shoots come from all walks of life , but many admit to lacking confidence when it comes to their appearance role model : @entity171 ( pictured ) won @entity9 's annual @entity173 competition last year , after writing a heartwarming love letter to her own body transformation : ms @entity7 told @entity17 that her work and the people that she has met through doing her shoots have helped to change her life for the better sit ! the women involved in each of the shoots are encouraged to be silly and have fun during the past three years , the team have had letters from a number of different women , all from different walks of life , from cancer survivors to pole dancers , rape victims to trans women			1
last year 's winner , @entity171 , described in her letter her ongoing struggle to try and embrace and love her body for what it - instead of always comparing it to someone that she felt was better or more beautiful than her			2
' @entity205 , ' she wrote at the start of her letter			0
' you have not always been easy to love			0
' or rather , others have not always made it easy to love you			0
' you were always too tall , too round , and too fat			0
' her letter ended on a positive note however , as she remarked the ways in which she has slowly learned to appreciate her own body for what it is			0
be proud : ms @entity7 and her team want the women to feel confident and happy about themselves age is just a number : the shameless photography team have worked with women of all ages , shapes and sizes i 'm a survivor : the company 's @entity173 competition sees entries from women around the world , including cancer survivors , rape victims and trans women strength is beauty : ms @entity7 admits that confidence is a ' rare and precious ' thing ' it took some time , body , but i see that , yes , you are tall and round and fat , and you are everything i need to be			1
' ... i understand , too , that it does not require a sickness to love you			0
' people may admire you , body , for you are beautiful and capable of amazing things			0
' i am sorry it took me so long to know and love you in this way , but you are tougher than you appear , and you waited for me to come around			0
' the roller derby fan credited her discovery of the sport with helping her to realize how powerful her body is - and how strong and effective it is when it comes to competing alongside her team			2
' these women , some with bodies just like you , gave themselves names like " @entity266 " , ' she added			0
' they told us to " get low " and , amazingly , to " be big "			0
and our wounds began to heal			0
