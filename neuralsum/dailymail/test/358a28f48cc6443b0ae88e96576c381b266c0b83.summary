this incredible video shows the stomach - churning moment a man performed surgery on himself at the top of the mountain using items from his first aid kit			1
the @entity9 man , who was filming a documentary in snow - covered mountains , found himself injured and unable to continue the ascent			1
it is believed the man , whose nickname is ' @entity15 ' , was struck by a huge falling icicle , causing a collection of blood under the skin called a haemotoma			1
the blood formed a clot which caused a huge swelling and bruising , leaving him in pain and unable to walk			2
speaking in @entity9 in the video , he said : ‘ if you mountain climb , fish or hunt , you must be ready for difficulties and think of safety			2
' the insignificant trauma can cause serious problems if you do n’t take the right actions			0
’ carrying out the operation - with some surgical instruments he had in his backpack - was ‘ the most reasonable and effective action ’ , he said			0
viewers must be aware the footage contains extremely graphic content			0
first , he decides to use snow as an anaesthetic , and rubs it on his leg to numb the injury			1
then , he burns a scalpel on a gas torch in order to make it sterile			2
‘ now it is possible to start the operation , ’ he explains in the video			0
in the original film , which has been edited by @entity84 , the man is seen making a deep incision into his leg with a scalpel , and blood is seen flowing out			1
he reaches into the cut with his fingers and scoops out the coagulated blood – almost black in colour – which had formed into a clot			1
with no sign of pain – or any emotion at all – he says : ‘ as you can see here it is n’t necessary for special anaesthesia , snow perfectly coped with this task			2
’ he cleans away all the clotted blood , until fresh , red blood is seen			2
he then pours hydrogen peroxide on the wound to clean it , which fizzes and clears away the blood			2
hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic			0
the man decided to perform a procedure to remove the blood clot himself , rubbing snow on his leg as an anaesthetic he used items in his first aid kit which included a gas lamp , a scalpel , surgical string , a needle holder and a curved needle as well as a hydrogen peroxide antiseptic ‘ we consider that a tiny wound , we will sew it up now , ’ he said after wiping the cut clean with a tissue			1
using some surgical string , a needle holder and a curved needle , he then sews up the wound , creating large , rustic - looking stitches			1
once again , he comments on how remarkably unpainful the whole procedure has been			0
‘ it is worth noticing that anaesthesia by means of snow is very effective			0
pain is n’t felt , ’ he tells the camera			0
wrapping a bandage around the wound , he stamps his leg on the snow to indicate he can walk again			1
‘ @entity142 is finished , ’ he declares			0
he cuts a deep incision in his own leg using a scalpel , which he sterilised by heating it with a gas lamp using his own hands he scoops out blood which has coagulated and formed a clot , before sewing the wound up with surgical string incredibly , ten days later the seams were removed and the wound healed completely , leaving barely any scar two weeks later , he is seen casually sitting on an armchair in the snow , having completely recovered			1
‘ i did n’t die of gangrene , ’ he exclaims , adding that wound did not become infected and there was no need to discharge any pus from it			0
incredibly , the seams were removed in ten days and the wound healed completely			1
the camera pans in on his leg and , amazingly , he was left with barely any scar			1
while others may have waxed lyrical about their ordeal , his concluding thoughts are that it is essential to have a surgical needle in one ’s backpack			0
‘ it is possible to use a sharp penknife instead of a scalpel and flat nose pliers instead of a needle - holder , ’ he said			0
‘ but unfortunately it is difficult to replace a surgical needle with something else so i advise having it in the first - aid kit			0
