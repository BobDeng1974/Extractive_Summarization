the government has suffered a massive defeat over plans to outlaw ‘ annoying ’ behaviour which could have outlawed noisy children , carol singers and nudists			2
dozens of @entity8 and @entity10 peers in the @entity11 struck out the plan to impose new injunctions on people accused of creating ‘ nuisance and annoyance ’			1
critics said the legislation would have had a ‘ chilling effect on lawful conduct ’ and insisted the @entity20 public must show ‘ tolerance and forbearance ’			0
nudists groups warned parks and beaches could be out of bounds for naturists under the new laws aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour the row centres on the @entity33 which includes power for the courts to grant an injunction against someone who ‘ has engaged in , or is threatening to engage in , anti-social behaviour ’			1
the government wants to replace anti-social behaviour orders ( @entity41 ) with injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance ( @entity44 )			1
under the new rule , an injunction could be granted if a person has ‘ engaged in conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person ’			1
but opponents warn people behaving perfectly legally like street preachers , trick - or - treaters , church bell ringers and clay pigeon shooters could fall foul of the law just because some people are annoyed by their hobbies			1
it was warned bell ringers and carol singers would be silenced under the law if someone claimed they were being annoying @entity66 was warned that @entity67 and @entity68 would be ‘ annoyed ’ about a man wearing a @entity71 suit outside @entity72 , the @entity11 was told			1
lord @entity73 , a former met police chief , revealed that he was warned the @entity75 and home secretary would be angered by a publicity stunt on @entity78 in 2007			2
he branded the proposed @entity80 law ‘ a piece of absolutely awful legislation and we should seek to avoid it ’			0
the independent crossbench peer said that in 2007 when @entity67 came out of @entity87 to deliver a budget there was a man standing ‘ amid the cameras dressed in a full @entity71 outfit with a notice saying " @entity68 for prime minister "			1
‘ it was reported to me as commissioner that the chancellor was likely to be annoyed , ’ lord @entity73 said			2
‘ it was reported to me in very firm terms that ( home secretary ) @entity68 was going to be extremely annoyed			2
‘ as the commissioner i was annoyed because the home secretary was annoyed , but nobody used the words harassment , distress or alarm			2
‘ the difference between the words about annoyance and how that will be interpreted on the street by housing officers , by police officers and so on is so important			0
‘ this is n't a matter for judges , people will be told to move on to get out of the way by people who are in authority because that is the easiest thing to do when they have got somebody complaining			2
’ @entity121 , a former chief constable of @entity122 , was backed by several prominent @entity8 and @entity10 to strike out the phrase ‘ nuisance and annoyance ’ in the legislation with ‘ harassment , alarm or distress ’ - the same wording used for @entity41 introduced by the @entity130 government			1
@entity132 defeated the government by 306 to 178 , majority 128			0
lord @entity121 said @entity44 could be used for anyone over the age of 10 , only required proof ‘ on the balance of probability ’ , could last for an indefinite period of time and result in a prison term if breached			0
he warned a power which had worked for dealing with housing issues would be inappropriate to be used in the ‘ public environment ’			0
he insisted the current wording of the legislation would result in practitioners leaving it to the courts to decide , which would cause a ‘ chilling effect on lawful conduct ’			0
he told peers : ‘ it risks it being used for those who seek to protest peacefully , noisy children in the street , street preachers , canvassers , carol singers , trick - or - treaters , church bell ringers , clay pigeon shooters , nudists			0
‘ this is a crowded island that we live in and we must exercise a degree surely of tolerance and forbearance			0
‘ because i shall continue to be privately annoyed at those who jump the bus queue , those who stand smoking in large groups outside their office , drinkers who block the footpath outside a pub on a summer 's evening , those who put their feet on the seats on public transport , those who protest noisily outside @entity177 or my local bank , but none of that surely should risk an injunctive procedure on the grounds of nuisance and annoyance			1
@entity194 , a leading qc and @entity130 peer , said : ‘ my main concern is the extent to which lowering the threshold to behaviour capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person has the potential to undermine our fundamental freedoms and in particular the way in which the proposed law might be used to curb protest and freedom of expression			1
’ peers were told that under coalition plans the police , @entity211 , the @entity212 , local authorities , @entity214 , the health secretary and housing providers would be among the bodies able to apply to use @entity221			0
conservative @entity222 of @entity223 , a former lord chancellor , also opposed the government , telling peers : ‘ one of the fundamental freedoms is the freedom of speech and it is surely clear that in exercising that one may annoy other people , one or more			0
’ former attorney general @entity231 of @entity232 criticised the @entity233 for bringing forward ‘ ill thought out ’ proposals with ‘ little regard for the consequences ’			0
home office minister @entity237 earlier tried to placate opponents by offering to put forward an amendment which he said would address the ‘ concerns of the breadth of the nuisance or annoyance test ’			1
the government amendment would have changed the wording of the legislation so that it covered behaviour ‘ that could reasonably be expected to cause nuisance or annoyance ’ instead of behaviour ‘ capable of causing nuisance or annoyance ’			1
he denied the @entity256 would create a ‘ chilling effect ’ on free speech			0
but the government was still defeated on @entity121 ’s amendment , which was backed by 25 @entity8 rebels and 16 @entity10 rebels .			2
