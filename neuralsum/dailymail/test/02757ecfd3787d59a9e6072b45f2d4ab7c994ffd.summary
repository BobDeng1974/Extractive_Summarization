a few weeks ago , some members of @entity2 ’s ground staff thought the club ’s principal owner @entity3 had arrived for an impromptu visit to the training ground when a @entity7 pulled into the car park			2
@entity3 is an infrequent visitor to @entity9 , exiled for tax and lifestyle purposes in the @entity12 , where he conducts much of his business on his enormous yacht			0
results on the pitch had taken a bit of a downturn and there was an air of anticipation when the driver got out to open the door for his wealthy passenger			0
@entity26 pictured on his last start for @entity2 against @entity28 back in early november @entity26 travelled in style to training earlier this year in a @entity7 age : 31 @entity32 : @entity33 clubs @entity34 ( 2001 - 2003 ) : 53 appearances , 19 goals @entity37 ( 2003 - 2006 ) : 115 apps , 26 goals @entity40 ( 2006 - 2009 ) : 142 apps , 62 goals @entity43 ( 2009 - 2012 ) : 45 apps , 19 goals @entity46 ( 2011 ) : 22 apps , 8 goals @entity2 ( 2011 - ) : 106 apps , 41 goals @entity51 @entity37 - @entity53 runner - up ( 2003 - 04 ) @entity46 - @entity54 ( 2010 - 11 ) it was then that the grinning figure of @entity26 emerged , throwing sand in the face of his employers with another outlandish display of his extravagant lifestyle			1
he went on to train as normal with the first team , while his driver waited in the @entity7 before returning the forward to his @entity65 home shortly after @entity66 had finished the morning session			0
since @entity26 ’s last start in the @entity69 for @entity2 , when he was dragged off the pitch after 58 minutes at @entity28 on november 2 , he has pocketed £ 3.4million in wages			1
it was that day at @entity73 when @entity74 came on as a substitute , scoring his first @entity69 goal of the season for @entity2 and diving , @entity79 - style , in front of the travelling fans after he scored the winner			1
by then @entity26 had taken his seat on the bench after one of the most listless , lifeless displays of his entire career			2
that day he had just 32 touches of the ball and none of them were good			0
on the bad days at @entity2 , when he is in a particularly confrontational mood , he tells people that he is only prepared to leave @entity2 if they can fix a move to @entity46 or @entity96			2
he played for @entity46 once before , a short - term solution for @entity98 during his spell at the @entity100 , and he has always craved the chance to play for @entity96			0
this has not been a good year			0
he has scored just twice - in the 4 - 0 victory over @entity104 on august 24 and the defeat by @entity106 on october 26 - under their new head coach			1
@entity26 has spent a large chunk of the campaign on the substitutes ' bench for @entity2 @entity26 's last goal was against @entity106 in october - one of only two scored this season this is the final year that @entity43 will make a contribution to his salary , topping up his £ 100,000 - a - week wages at @entity118 with another £ 70,000 each week as part of the deal that took him south			1
they , like @entity2 , did not get their money ’s worth out of him either			2
his last appearance for @entity66 was as a substitute on march 15 , sent on to the pitch at @entity127 when the team were already 3 - 0 down against @entity129			1
he has no future at @entity2			2
last season , @entity131 made a point of saying his job was ‘ to manage men ’ when @entity26 went through something of a renaissance under the former @entity2 head coach			1
getting him off the wage bill this summer will be a problem , with @entity2 in hock to him for one final year on £ 100,000 a week until his contract expires on june 30 , 2016			1
talks aimed at removing him from the list of players on the club ’s wage bill are already underway , but @entity26 will not go easily			2
naturally , like anyone else in his position , he will want his money			0
this could have been solved in february , when @entity152 came to the table with an offer to take the forward on loan for the rest of the season			0
@entity159 , son of former @entity40 vice president @entity160 , was brokering a deal that gave @entity152 , @entity26 and @entity2 the option to make his move permanent			1
throw in the £ 75,000 a week the @entity152 were willing to contribute to his complicated salary and it looked like pretty good business for @entity2 @entity26 did have something of a renaissance under former @entity2 manager @entity131 ( right ) @entity26 , pictured during a session , turned up at training in a @entity7 @entity74 ( left ) has 30 goals in all competitions for @entity2 this season @entity174 ’s intransigence on the issue is well known , highlighted by @entity176 ’s tweet - ‘ no matter how hard you try there are some people out there that you just ca n’t do business with ’ - when the deal collapsed			1
in recent weeks @entity26 has been named a substitute on occasion , making up the numbers on the bench because of an injury to another troubled forward , @entity189			1
the thing with @entity26 is that it is not all bad , despite goading his employers with pictures on his @entity195 account when he is goofing around at home when his team are travelling for a @entity199 tie			0
he is capable of extreme acts of generosity , such as the house he rented out in @entity203 for all his friends and their girlfriends last summer during the @entity206			0
@entity26 footed the bill for the lot			0
as ever , though , @entity26 ’s clubs will continue to pay the biggest price .			0

@entity26 is behind @entity74 and @entity189 at @entity2
@entity26 last appeared for @entity2 in 3 - 0 defeat at @entity129 in march
