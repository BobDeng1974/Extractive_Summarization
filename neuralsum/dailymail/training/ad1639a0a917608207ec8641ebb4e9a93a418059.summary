by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:31 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 10 december 2013 it might not seem very statesmanlike but at least it is festive			0
deputy prime minister @entity4 revealed his official @entity6 card today , complete with him in a @entity8 hat and wife @entity9 reindeer ears and @entity12 's red nose			1
the humorous image is the work of their sons , and is a marked departure from the carefully stage - managed portraits chosen by the other political leaders			1
joke : deputy prime minister @entity4 allowed his sons to use an @entity22 to doctor this photograph of him and wife @entity24 @entity26 and @entity27 have both opted for more serious photographs with their wives and children , designed to present themselves as relaxed family men			1
in the past mr @entity4 has opted for traditional drawings or paintings by his children , but this year @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 have used a photograph of mum and dad as a starting point for their masterpiece			1
the picture was taken at the family home in @entity46 by photographer @entity47			2
the @entity4 boys then used an @entity22 to add the christmas tree and transform their parents into @entity8 and @entity12			1
mr @entity4 has consistently refused to place his children in the media spotlight in the same way as other political leaders			1
by contrast @entity54 leader @entity27 yesterday released his smart - casual @entity6 card , featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue			1
labour leader @entity27 and his wife @entity62 take their children @entity65 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) for a walk along @entity69 beach , in a photograph chosen for his official @entity6 card the @entity27 family portrait shows mr @entity27 and wife @entity62 with their sons @entity65 and @entity75			1
it was taken during a walk along @entity69 beach at the start of the @entity54 conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way			1
in smart trousers and a grey pullover , mr @entity27 appears to be straining to look relaxed			1
when the pictures were taken in september it was noted that they were markedly different to @entity90 ’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children			0
but @entity54 strategists made clear that they wanted to give mrs @entity93 a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost			2
the release of the @entity100 's card comes after @entity101 revealed @entity26 ’s three - year - old daughter @entity102 has been given a starring role in the prime minister ’s official @entity6 card - for the second time			1
greeting : prime minister @entity26 and his wife @entity106 photographed with daughter @entity102 at 10 @entity108 for their 2013 @entity6 card the striking black and white portrait features mr @entity26 and wife @entity106 hugging their daughter inside @entity101 in october			1
the card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries , as well as to senior figures in the @entity119			2
captured by award - winning photographer @entity121 , the picture shows the @entity122 ’ youngest child gripping her father ’s neck while she snuggles against her mother			0
- @entity128 leader @entity127 it is striking that the three - year - old features so prominently because @entity26 has closely guarded his children ’s privacy since moving to @entity101 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated			2
mr @entity26 has opted for a photograph of himself and wife @entity106 each year since taking power in 2010 , when they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby @entity102 on the steps of @entity101			1
the outspoken mep @entity142 does not take himself so seriously			1
after a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments about aid to ‘ @entity149 ’ and women being ‘ sluts ’ for not doing the cleaning properly , the 64 - year - old and his wife have posed for a self - mocking @entity6 card			0
@entity142 holds bongos in their @entity6 card and wife @entity156 does her best ' slut ' impression the @entity142 for @entity159 and the @entity160 , who quit the @entity119 @entity128 in september to sit as an independent , clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife @entity156 is dressed as a ‘ slut ’			1
the photo , taken in the kitchen of the couple ’s house in a village near @entity170 , @entity159 , will be on cards posted to friends and family			2
but his old boss , @entity128 leader @entity127 , takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards			2
' rest assured , any cards sent from family @entity127 will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it , ' he said			2
@entity185 first minister @entity184 revealed his official @entity6 card last week , an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who turned up too late to see @entity189			0
he opted for the bleak , sinewy painting of @entity191 by @entity185 artist @entity192			0
festive ? this painting of the fourth wise man @entity194 by @entity192 will grace the front of the first minister @entity184 's 2013 charity @entity6 card the artwork will be sold to raise money for charity , but some questioned whether its choice for a @entity6 card was not very festive			0
since 2007 mr @entity184 has raised £ 148,000 for charities in @entity185 through sales of the original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card			0
today he unveiled the @entity210 painting , which will be sold at auction in the @entity212 with the proceeds shared between the @entity214 ( @entity215 ) , @entity216 , @entity217 ( @entity217 ) and @entity218 , the charity chosen by the artist			0
he insisted the image of @entity191 is a ‘ hugely appropriate ’ work for his card			0
mr @entity184 said : ‘ the legend of @entity191 , or the fourth wise man , is based on a novel by @entity225			0
it tells the tale of a @entity229 scholar who , delayed by helping the vulnerable , follows the star to @entity231 but arrives just too late to herald the birth of the @entity234 child			0
‘ thirty years on in @entity235 , at passover , @entity194 is still searching			0
‘ now an old man , he parts with the last of his three gifts to @entity189 , a sapphire , a ruby and a pearl , to save a young girl from slavery			0
however , in a dying vision , @entity194 is comforted that his devotion to the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven			0
‘ the story reminds us that hope , faith and self - sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things .			0
