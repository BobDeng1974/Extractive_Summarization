invisible to the naked eye , and smaller than a grain of sand , this etching of a formula 1 car is so tiny it fits onto the front of a razor blade that is thinner than a beam of light			1
experts used a scanning electron microscope ( @entity10 ) with an electron column and needle to make the miniature engraving			1
the result is an image that is just 250 micrometres by 700 micrometres in size ( 0.25mm by 0.7mm )			1
the result is an image that is just 250 micrometres by 700 micrometres in size - a quarter of a millimetre			1
the average grain of sand is around 1mm in diameter by comparison , the average grain of sand is around 1mm in diameter			0
sems are typically used to inspect specimens in labs			0
the @entity10 uses an electron beam to trace over the specimen , while creating an digital replica on a screen			1
this digital version is a 3d image that can be manipulated			0
as the electron beam traces over the object , it hits the surface and sends secondary electrons from this surface into unique patterns			1

as the electron beam traces over the object , it hits the surface and sends secondary electrons from this surface into unique patterns			1
a secondary electron detector attracts those scattered electrons and , depending on the number of electrons that reach the detector , registers different levels of brightness on a monitor			2
these patterns and images can be used to learn about the surface topography and composition			2

these patterns and images can then be used to learn about the surface topography and composition			2
the electon beam itself is controlled by a microscope , and the @entity10 creates a magnetic field using a scanning coil			1
by changing the voltage , experts are able to manipulate the strength and position of the beam			1
in this case , they used this to control the movement of the needle			0
the nanoscientists from @entity99 - based @entity98 worked with @entity100 on the project , and the car featured on the blade is the @entity104 - 29			2
the autographs of @entity108 drivers @entity106 and @entity109 were also etched onto the surface			1
the team spent around 25 to 30 hours trying various different designs , sizes and ratios , to get the precise final result			0
dr @entity116 , research officer in @entity117 from the @entity118 was involved in the project			0
he said : ' this was a unique project because it was the first time i had ever tried to engrave a signature , or a formula 1 car			0
' i ’ve never engraved a razor blade before			1

the engravings were made to demonstrate the precision engineering used by both brands ' the technology used is a feat of precision technology , so we ’re dealing with images that are typically 250 micrometres , to 700 micrometres - that ’s a quarter of a millimetre			1
' it ’s been challenging , but it ’s a real achievement of 21st century technology			0
' the engravings were made to demonstrate the precision engineering used by both brands , and five @entity98 razors will be framed and given to fans			0
its release also coincides with the final grand prix of the season in @entity159 this weekend			0
the autographs of @entity108 drivers @entity109 ( pictured left ) and @entity106 ( pictured right ) were also etched onto the surface			1
the images have been released to coincide with the final grand prix of the season this weekend @entity98 and @entity100 will now apply to @entity167 to measure the engraving on the razor ( pictured )			2
@entity98 currently holds the record for the world 's smallest advert , which measured 100 microns and was etched into a whisker			0
this record was set in 2011 and used similar technology @entity106 said : ' the role of a racing driver is the management of high - precision performance - in a grand prix , finding the last millimetre on the track or the final thousandth of a second of laptime sometimes counts the most			2
' and when you spend so much time chasing those tiny fractions , you can become obsessed with them			0
the results are really incredible			0
