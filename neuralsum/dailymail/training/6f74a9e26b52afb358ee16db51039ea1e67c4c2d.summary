the @entity1 machine is allows a person to control and monitor their washing using their smartphone finding time to put a load of washing on and take it out again before it starts to dry can be taxing when trying to juggle other household chores			1
but @entity11 has set out to make the job less onerous with the launch of a smart washing machine that can be operated using a smartphone app. the @entity1 machine is the first domestic @entity17 washing machine to be sold in the @entity18			1
it is also the first to be made by the company that allows a person to remotely control and monitor their washing using their mobile – letting them get about and about while their clothes are being cleaned			1
@entity11 is not the only manufacturer to offer machines that can interact with a smartphone			0
@entity30 and @entity31 have smart models and @entity11 itself has equipped some current machines with a feature called @entity36 , which allows people to detect and diagnose errors with an app. but the @entity1 is the only one in the range to let people start and stop a cycle from their mobile			1
the futuristic washing machine , which will go on sale in may across @entity45 , also has a ‘ super speed wash setting ’ that cleans clothes in under an hour by quickly filling the drum with water through its twin water supply			1
it is not known if or when the model will be sold in the @entity53 or @entity54			0
an ' auto optimal wash ' option uses four sensing technologies to determine the right wash cycle , looking at temperature , washing time , rinse cycle and spin speed , based on the size of the laundry load and how dirty the clothes are			2
it has intelligent settings to tackle specific kind of stains , including gardening and cooking , as well as sports and hygiene care functions , but @entity11 has not yet said how much the smart machine will cost			1
the futuristic washing machine , which will go on sale in may across @entity45 , also has a ' super speed wash setting ' that cleans clothes in under an hour by quickly filing the drum with water through its twin water supply the array of options can be navigated by a 5inch colour touchscreen instead of knobs and dials so that the machine can easily display the most used and favourite settings to let users navigate all the options easily			1
the machine has been designed to reduce the amount of energy used by using an ‘ ecobubble ’ generator to dissolve detergent quicker			2
air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles , dissolving and activating the detergent , which then penetrates faster and more evenly throughout the wash load , according to @entity11			2
this helps to dissolve washing detergent , creating rich soapy foam that penetrates clothes faster , so less hot water is required , and therefore saves energy on every load , it claims			2
the @entity1 model has an extra large door and a ‘ translucent deep blue crystal finish ’ that @entity11 says ‘ creates a beautiful spectrum of colours when it comes into contact with light ’			1
an array of washing options can be navigated by a five inch colour touchscreen ( pictured ) instead of knobs and dials so that the machine can easily display the most used and favourite settings design : a big door is placed higher up than usual on the machine so that people do not have to bend down as far to retrieve their washing from the machine , which has a streamlined appearance			1
easy to use : a five inch colour screen lets people choose cycles , including their most - used cycle , by touching a button			2
the washing can be started and stopped using a smartphone app. auto - optimal wash : sensing technology is used to gather information about the size and dirtiness of the load as well as how much detergent is needed			0
based on this information , the setting determines the most suitable wash cycle , temperature , time , rinse cycle and spin speed			0
@entity145 : laundry can be done in 60 minutes as the machine uses a twin water supply to fill the drum quickly			0
specialty cycles : these are cycles designed to blitz garden and cooking stains , among others			0
energy saving : the washer uses ‘ ecobubble ’ technology			0
air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles , dissolving the detergent faster so that temperatures can be lower and less energy is used			0
quiet : a 3d vibration sensor system keeps the drum well balanced at high spin speeds by ensuring 14 stainless steel balls spin together in the opposite direction to the laundry load			0
at lower drum speeds , powerful magnets hold the balls firmly in place and significantly decrease vibration and noise , the company said .			0
