by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 6 february 2013 when @entity3 was born with a smudge in the corner of her mouth , her parents thought nothing of it			1
but they were horrified after it developed into a tennis ball - sized tumour that meant she could n't eat or drink			1
now after years of pain , disbelieving doctors , name - calling , and surgery , little @entity3 can finally smile			1
her mother @entity17 , 39 , said : ' she had her final plastic surgery on her mouth last year and it 's made such a difference			2
now she has normal lips like me , which is what she wanted			0
' amazing girl ' : @entity3 's parents said their daughter ( pictured left as a baby ) never complained about the pain she suffered over the years			1
she loves her new lips created using plastic surgery ( right ) ' she 's confident and happy , with no side effects from all the nasty comments from strangers in the street			1
' she 's one amazing girl			0
' mrs @entity3 , from @entity34 , had a normal pregnancy apart from @entity3 being born four weeks early			1
it was n't until they she and husband @entity37 , 42 , took @entity3 home that they noticed the red mark near their baby 's lip			1
they showed it to the health visitor who came to inspect @entity3 and were reassured it was probably a @entity50 birthmark			1
but it quickly grew bigger and then when @entity3 was three months old she scratched it with her nail , leaving a nasty , weeping wound			1
@entity17 said : ' we took her to the hospital but they said nothing was wrong with her			0
@entity3 was crying all the time			1
she was n't feeding and was getting thin			2
' i knew it was infected			0
' @entity3 was just a few days old when her parents spotted a smudge in the corner of her mouth medics discovered @entity3 had 36 haemangiomas in total , including one on her nose ( l ) , she had laser surgery to fade the birthmark ( seen right with her sister @entity71 ) the couple were so desperate for help that @entity17 's concerned grandfather , @entity74 , offered to pay for @entity3 to see a specialist privately			1
they spoke to a nurse at @entity78 in @entity79 who told them to bring @entity3 in immediately after mrs @entity3 said she was n't eating			1
it was then @entity3 was diagnosed with a haemangioma - blood vessels that grow and turn into benign tumours - and she was immediately given morphine			1
@entity17 said : ' the doctor described the pain she was in was like someone cutting open her mouth with a knife			2
' i 'd been told there was nothing wrong by our local hospital so she 'd had no pain relief			0
' @entity3 was severely dehydrated and so was put on a drip and tube fed. doctors had to remove her infected and scarred flesh because her mouth had become so @entity102 also gave her steroids to help shrink the haemangioma			1
her condition eventually improved to the relief of her parents but then the infection returned and she stopped drinking again			2
two weeks later , she was allowed home from hospital			0
but at six months old , the tumour burst while @entity3 was with her father out shopping			1
she was rushed to hospital because it would n't stop bleeding and she was treated with a special type of fibre glass			0
@entity3 with her proud parents and sister medics discovered @entity3 had 36 haemangiomas in total , including one on her nose and another on her liver			1
she was treated with steroids but these had no effect and her parents were forced to put up with stares wherever they went			2
mrs @entity3 , said : ' normally , when you have a baby people tell you how beautiful they are but that did n't @entity129 discovered @entity3 had 36 haemangiomas in total , ' people would stop her buggy , look in and say horrid things like " look at your baby 's disgusting face "			1
' i liked to take the girls on the bus into town and one day , when @entity3 was 18 months old , i saw a lady watching me			1
' as she got off , she said she felt sorry for my daughter and threw Â£ 5 at her			0
'' i would try and hide her face when we were out			0
it was n't because i was ashamed			0
to me , she was gorgeous but i hated people staring			0
' people could n't see her for who she was because she had this huge growth on her face it was really upsetting			0
' @entity17 and @entity37 with @entity3 as a baby			1
@entity17 said : ' to me , she was gorgeous but i hated people staring ' at two years old , @entity3 had her first laser surgery , which helped the birthmark to fade			2
but she needed further operations to remove the tumour			2
mrs @entity3 said : ' we did n't want it done to make her more ' acceptable '			1
we asked @entity3 and it was her choice to go ahead with the surgery			2
she said : " i want normal lips like @entity164			0
" ' before her mouth and nose were wonky but now it 's much better			0
her face is more symmetrical			0
she 's really happy with it			0
' she will need check - ups now until her teens then another tidy up surgery but it finally feels like our nightmare is over			2
' mr @entity176 added : ' it was horrendous watching her go through what she did			0
as a parent , you want to take away their pain			0
' she 's never complained though			0
@entity3 is very matter of fact and just gets on with things			2
