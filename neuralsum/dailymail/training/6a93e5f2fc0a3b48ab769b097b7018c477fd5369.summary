a protruding belly , high blood pressure and intense sugar cravings			1
this is what happens to the body after drinking 10 cans of @entity7 a day , according to one man who took up the challenge			1
@entity10 prior , 50 , decided to embark on a ' @entity7 diet ' in order to show the harmful effects of the high levels of sugar found in the world 's most popular drink			1
in just 30 days he saw drastic changes to his formerly healthy and muscular physique			2
he developed a protruding stomach and waistline and his weight ballooned from 12 stone ( 168lb ) to 14 stone ( 192 lb )			1
his blood pressure soared from 129/77 to 145/96			1
this is way above the ideal level of 120/80 - and above this level , the risk of heart disease or stroke is greatly increased			0
he is pictured before ( left ) and after ( right ) embarking on the challenge mr prior also saw his blood pressure soar from 129/77 to 145/96			1
high blood pressure is linked with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke ' the most dramatic change was in weight : 23lb of gain over thirty days , ' mr prior said			1
his weight is pictured rising throughout the experiment ( left )			2
after a month he weighed almost 14 stone ( right ) as well as the fast weight gain , mr prior , a father - of - two , said he feared he was becoming addicted to @entity7 after experiencing intense cravings			1
while he tried to stick to his normal @entity53 diet – a low - carbohydrate diet which focuses on eating lean meats , vegetables and berries – he began experiencing sugar cravings that were difficult to ignore			1
' the most dramatic change was in weight : 23lb of gain over 30 days , ' mr prior , who lives in @entity60 , said			0
' i also seemed to develop a craving for @entity65 , or other sugars , during the time i was drinking @entity65			0
' ' [ as a result ] , i 'm urging people to examine the amount of sugar in their diets			0
' people need to be aware of the real and powerful damaging effects of sugar on their health			2
mr prior 's experiment comes shortly after @entity80 assemblyman @entity79 said fizzy drinks ' are the new smoking ' and called for sugar - laden beverages to carry warning labels similar to those found on cigarette packets			2
mr @entity79 said the aim of his bill , which would introduce warning labels on drinks , is to educate the public , and lower the consumption of the drinks			0
earlier this year , the @entity93 published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than five cubes of sugar a day			1
the guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco			0
the number of obese @entity105 adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £ 50 billion a year			0
the @entity93 said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts , muesli , sauces , fizzy drinks , juice and smoothies			2
however , low - fat foods have also come under fire from experts , after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full - fat alternative			2
who also said children should try for less than five cubes of sugar a day and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as @entity7 , which contains seven cubes			1
instead five cubes is the ideal figure that people should aim for			0
in march , the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) called for the recommended daily intake of sugar to be slashed from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day			1
a regular can of @entity7 contains 35g of sugar , the equivalent of seven cubes , so that alone would exceed this limit			1
as part of his challenge , mr prior drank 10 cans of @entity7 a day - a total of 350g of sugar - the equivalent of around 70 cubes			1
experts warn fizzy drinks contain sugar but have no other nutritional value , and mr prior said he found it hard to eat as much food because the @entity7 left him full at lunch and dinner times			1
the bbq accessory entrepreneur said he wanted to stir up debate : ' i did the experiment to get people thinking and talking about how much sugar they eat and how unhealthy it is			1
' i would prefer not to do it again			0
' i do n't like being this heavy			0
' the actual drinking of the 10 @entity65 got to be an irritating chore every day			2
' there were a lot of visits to the restroom , a feeling of constant fullness , and a clutter of cans everywhere			2
' after mr prior stopped drinking the fizzy soft drink he lost 5lb in four days			2
he now concerned about the effect of sugar can have on children			0
he said : ' kids should n't drink @entity65			2
' but then kids should n't drink juices , either , and that 's going to be a very hard sell to parents who believe that juice is " natural " , or even " organic "			2
' it 's sugar , and not only do kids not need it , it 's bad for them			0
indeed , past research has found sugary drinks are a primary contributor to type 2 diabetes and tooth decay , especially in children			0
as part of his challenge , mr prior drank 10 cans of @entity7 a day - a total of 350g of sugar - the equivalent of around 70 cubes			1
pictured are the cans left over from his experiment a 330ml can of @entity7 contains 35g of sugars , the equivalent of sevent cubes			1
this is more than the recommended daily intake of 25g , or five cubes , set by the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) a 500ml bottle of @entity7 contains even more sugar - 53g or almost 11 cubes			1
this is twice the who 's recommended daily allowance for a normal adult and experts warn that fizzy drinks are also fuelling the obesity epidemic - and , in turn , other serious illnesses , including cancer , heart disease and stroke			1
mr prior added : ' i think there are a lot of people suffering health problems like diabetes and heart disease , who are n't aware they could help themselves by just stopping sugar			0
' he also blasted @entity7 for their marketing techniques to make consumers believe ' they care ' when they are just creating more products to sell			0
' the latest member of the @entity7 family , called @entity243 , is marketed as having less sugar than regular @entity7 but none of the artificial sweeteners that increasingly worry @entity248 drinkers			1
the new naturally sweetened drink - which contains a third less sugar and calories than regular cola - has been created amid calls for the company to do more to tackle the global obesity epidemic			0
sold in a green can or a recyclable bottle , it is already available in the @entity105 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and is due to hit @entity263 shelves in april			0
@entity265 mr prior said : ' @entity267 's legal , soft drinks are legal , ' he said			0
' the responsibility is with consumers			0
' @entity7 's genius plan is " reduce " the amount of sugar in their drinks			1
' it 's genius because it makes them look like they care , but still continue to sell sugar			0
' i 'd like to see controls on the lobbying and spending of big corporations who sell sugar and do n't want the government to tell people how bad it is			0
' @entity287 has approached @entity7 for comment .			0
