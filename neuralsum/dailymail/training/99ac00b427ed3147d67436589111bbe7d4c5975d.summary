by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 18 april 2013 twelve - year - old @entity1 suffers from muscular dystrophy - a cruel degenerative disease which confines him to a wheelchair and will make him weaker and weaker over time			1
but with these beautiful pictures , entitled ' @entity8 ' , friend and photographer @entity5 has allowed him to explore an imaginary world where he can shoot a basketball , climb stairs and even perform a handstand			2
amazingly , the images did not require any digital trickery , @entity5 simply used coloured sheets and carefully placed objects and took the pictures from above			1
shooting hoops : the clever images allow @entity1 to explore a world where he can try sports like basketball trickery : the images were created without the help of @entity25 simply using coloured sheets and household objects @entity29 world : the touching images allowed @entity1 , 12 , to experience pleasures beyond the confines of his wheelchair deep sea dive : wearing flippers and with some carefully placed ping pong balls , @entity1 appears to be underwater inspired : the idea for the pictures came when @entity1 said he would like to see himself in photographs getting up to mischief due to his condition , @entity1 is unable to do even the most basic of everyday activities such as washing himself , dressing , and eating			1
his physical capability is mostly limited to tiny movements of his fingers , which allow him to move about in his electric wheelchair			0
but he is also able to hold a coloured pen , with which he can slowly turn his imagination into drawings in a notebook			0
the idea for the photographs came from a conversation @entity58 photographer @entity5 had with @entity1 when he said he would like to see himself in pictures , getting up to mischief			0
he pictured @entity61 from above as he posed on the ground , capturing the boy â€™s fighting spirit , positive attitude , and fun personality			0
personality : the images gave @entity1 the chance to showcase his determination , positive attitude and mischievous character black canvas : a world of opportunity was opened up to @entity1 , using just these coloured sheets			2

@entity1 is confined to a wheelchair by the degenerative disease
beautiful images were created without using @entity25 - just coloured sheets and household objects
pictures show him flying , playing basketball and even performing a handstand
