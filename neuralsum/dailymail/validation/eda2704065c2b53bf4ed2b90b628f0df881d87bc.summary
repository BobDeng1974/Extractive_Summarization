top earner : the @entity1 have voted to make @entity3 the best - paid politician in @entity4 the @entity1 has voted to make @entity3 the best - paid politician in @entity4			1
the @entity5 , which is controlled by the @entity1 , rubber - stamped a pay rise for all its members that takes miss @entity3 ’s official salary to £ 144,687 a year			1
her pay is now well above @entity11 ’s £ 142,500 earnings as well as the £ 143,911 that @entity12 is paid for his role as mayor of @entity15			1
aides to the first minister sensed a looming pr disaster and have insisted she would not take her salary in full			2
the row follows the @entity5 ’s vote on a 0.7 per cent salary rise yesterday			1
the move – which was passed unopposed – increases the first minister ’s official salary by just over £ 1,000 to £ 144,687			1
@entity26 are currently paid 87.5 per cent of an mp ’s salary , a figure that reflects their lesser responsibilities			2
but they voted to break that link , saying it was because they could not accept a 10 per cent pay rise mooted for mps after the election			0
however , the move means that @entity26 ’ wages will rise by 0.7 per cent to £ 59,089 on april 1			0
miss @entity3 will earn more than any other politician despite having no control of defence or foreign affairs , and only limited say on issues such as tax and benefits			2
critics pointed out that she only serves about five million people , compared to 64million served by mr @entity11			1
her aides said that she would actually draw a more modest salary of £ 135,605			1
but @entity50 @entity35 accused the @entity1 of treating voters in the rest of the country with contempt			2
@entity55 said @entity56 should pay for any @entity26 ’ pay rise by levying taxes in @entity59			2
every person living in @entity59 already gets far more spent on them than my constituents in @entity65 , and it ’s no surprise to see @entity1 politicians wanting their share of it			2
‘ if people in @entity59 want to pay for @entity3 and her @entity26 then that would be one thing – but it is taxpayers in @entity65 who are picking up the bill for the @entity1 ’s profligacy			1
‘ people in my constituency are sick to death of being asked to pay up so that @entity59 can have more spent on them			0
@entity3 's pay is now well above @entity11 ’s £ 142,500 earnings - even though she only serves about five million people ‘ they are also sick to death of seeing the @entity1 , who wanted out of this nation six months ago , now wanting to run the country			1
’ fellow @entity50 @entity88 said the pay rise underlined the threat posed by the @entity1			2
‘ this is a harbinger of what the @entity1 would do if they ever got into government , ’ he said			0
‘ we would get more spending , more borrowing and a total lack of restraint			0
‘ @entity3 is obviously not worth more than @entity11 – the idea is laughable			1
but the @entity1 have no appreciation of the struggle faced by millions of people who work hard , pay their taxes and do their best to make ends meet			1
it ’s all someone else ’s money to them			0
’ on monday , @entity56 made a speech in @entity15 in which she vowed to work with @entity107 to ‘ lock the @entity108 ’ out of power			0
she insisted voters would welcome her influence as a way to end austerity policies			0
@entity3 's pay is also above the £ 143,911 that @entity12 is paid for his role as mayor of @entity15			1
the pay row came as @entity107 ’s leader in @entity59 claimed that the funding deal under which @entity59 receives more than its fair share of cash for public services would be made ‘ permanent ’ if @entity107 wins power			0
the so - called @entity124 means that public spending per head in @entity65 stands at just £ 8,529 , compared to a staggering £ 10,152 in @entity59			0
@entity50 @entity35 – and many @entity127 in @entity65 – want the formula to be scrapped as part of any deal to give @entity59 additional powers			0
but @entity132 said : ‘ the @entity134 view is that the @entity124 is permanent – it is here to stay			0
’ and he added : ‘ abolishing the @entity124 would be a form of maximum austerity that @entity59 has never seen the like of before			0

@entity1 vote to make @entity3 best - paid politician in @entity4
salary boost to £ 144,687 was rubber stamped by the @entity5
pay now above @entity11 's £ 142,500 and @entity12 's £ 143,911
but aides say she would actually draw a more modest salary of £ 135,605
critics point out that @entity56 only serves about five million people
