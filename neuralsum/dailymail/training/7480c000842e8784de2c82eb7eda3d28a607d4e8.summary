for as long as people have been drinking too much , they have been searching for a cure for that dreaded morning after hangover			1
raw eggs with or without @entity6 sauce is apparently one cure ; others eat chocolate or a bacon sandwich - but the answer could be as simple as to carry on doing what you were doing that caused the hangover â€“ have a drink			2
@entity17 , the author of @entity18 , is of the opinion that the ' @entity20 ' makes you feel better , but the question is why it does this , and importantly whether it 's really a good idea			1
carry on drinking : apparently the best way to treat a hangover is to have another drink ( file photos ) every alcoholic drink contains , as well as ethanol , small traces of the poisonous methanol			2
in high doses methanol can make people go blind or even die because the body converts it to formaldehyde , a poison used as a preservative in some laboratories			0
doctors treat methanol poisoning by giving patients ethanol to prevent its change into formaldehyde			0
' if methanol poisoning is at least in part responsible for a hangover , having a drink the next morning may alleviate symptoms , ' said mr @entity17 although he was at pains to point out that the theory was ' hypothetical ' at best			1
drinking water if you have a hangover will have little or no effect on the way you feel ( file photo ) @entity58 , a psychopharmacologist at @entity59 and a member of the @entity61 , agreed that there was some scientific support for the idea			1
' alcohol acts on a number of chemicals in the brain to increase feelings of pleasure , ' she said			0
' reduction of hangover symptoms by " @entity20 " may also be due to the activity of alcohol on neurotransmitter systems			0
' one thing that appears to have no scientific basis is rehydration			0
mr @entity17 said : ' you can get rid of the dehydration and you are still hungover			2

most hangover cures do *n't* work and best idea may be to have another drink
author @entity17 points out that the theory is ' hypothetical at best '
drinking water has little or no effect on hangovers and will not help
