challenges : findings from a government - funded study show that the number of schoolchildren needing help for speech and language difficulties rose 71 per cent between 2005 and 2011			1
the rise has been blamed on the growing use of gadgets the number of children with speech difficulties has leapt 70 per cent in six years , according to a new study			1
as many as 1.2million youngsters are now estimated to struggle with speech			1
half of pupils in some areas start school unable to put sentences together			0
the rise is being blamed on the growing use of screen - based gadgets as convenient ‘ babysitters ’ and a trend for hard - working parents to spend less time with their children			1
teachers are also said to be identifying speech difficulties among pupils more readily			2
findings from a major new government - funded study show that the number of schoolchildren needing expert help for speech and language difficulties rose 71 per cent between 2005 - when reliable records began - and 2011			1
the analysis , part of the @entity42 , found that 2.2 per cent of youngsters aged five to 16 were classed as having difficulties in 2011 - some 135,700			1
but the figures do not capture pupils who are identified as having speech difficulties and are helped within their schools without recourse to specialists , for example using small group tuition			2
responding to the findings , the children ’s charity i can said other studies had suggested that 1.2million youngsters of all ages across the @entity60 have some form of communication problem			1
they include children with specific conditions that lead to speech problems and others whose environment may play a part in their language difficulties			1
the charity said that 50 per cent of children in some parts of the @entity60 - particularly areas of social disadvantage - start school with delayed language			1
worry : the study , published by the @entity77 , blames growing use of screen - based gadgets as convenient ' babysitters ' and a trend for hard - working parents to spend less time with their children for speech difficulties @entity86 , the government ’s former speech and language tsar and a trustee of i can , said the sharp rise in cases of speech difficulties was likely to be down to 21st century living , as well as better identification by parents and schools			1
screen - based technology - including tvs , games consoles , smartphones and computers - was increasingly used to occupy children instead of traditional family activities such as learning nursery rhymes and eating together , she warned			1
meanwhile both mothers and fathers were increasingly working long hours to make ends meet , forcing them to rely on childcare which can be patchy in quality			0
‘ head teachers are telling me they are seeing a real increase in the number of children who struggle to string words together , ’ she said			2
many reasons had been put forward to explain the trend , including the demise of family meal times and even the advent of central heating , which put an end to the days of families congregating around the fire in one room , she said			0
‘ head teachers also suggest that parents are just so busy these days trying to pay the mortgage and keep things together , ’ she said			0
difficulties : 2.2 per cent of youngsters aged five to 16 were classed as having difficulties in 2011 - some 135,700			1
posed by model ‘ they may not have as much time to play on the floor with their children and talk to their children			2
’ this affected ‘ cash - rich time - poor ’ middle - class parents as well as poorer households			0
in one case described by a head teacher , the parents of a five - year - old who could barely speak was given a @entity147 as a present			0
she added : ‘ it ’s not about parents not wanting to talk to their children but about the stresses of modern life			0
‘ this is n’t going to change but what parents can do is use the times they do have with their children - car journeys , bath times , meal times - to talk and listen to their children			1
’ she added : ‘ increased use of screen technology in all its forms is also suggested as a reason			0
’ mrs @entity86 said television programmes could be educational after the age of two if used as a springboard for family conversations rather than a substitute for them			0
problems : in one case described by a head teacher , the parents of a five - year - old who could barely speak was given a @entity147 as a present ( stock image ) she added that teachers were also thought to be ‘ getting better at getting under the skin of why children are struggling with learning ’			2
the latest study , published yesterday by the @entity183 , found that parents may face a long wait - in some cases up to two years - to access specialist support once they have raised a possible problem with their children ’s speech			1
it found that children who struggle with language during their early years were more likely to struggle at school			0
early intervention was crucial , it said , yet in many primary classes there was limited use of approaches to help children ’s language			0
@entity201 , chief executive of i can , said the research ‘ demonstrates that parents are having to wait as long as two years between noticing a child ’s difficulties and getting help			0
' this is n’t acceptable when every day matters to a child ’s language development ’			0
she added : ‘ we know there is a “ golden window ” between 0 to 5 where help and early interventions can make a material difference to a child ’s language			0
early years settings and schools can put programmes and interventions in place so that children do not slip through the net			0
’ @entity226 , children and families minister , said : ‘ communication is fundamental to all learning			2
it is vital that children with speech , language and communication needs get the support they deserve as soon as possible			2
