by @entity1 reporter a former @entity3 student was mistakenly suspected as a terrorist and placed on the government 's ' no - fly ' list for nine years because an @entity8 agent checked the wrong box on her form			1
@entity11 , 48 , an architect and scholar , is finally allowed to return to the @entity13 after fighting to clear her name since 2005			2
in january of that year , @entity15 was arrested and detained for two hours at @entity16 as she boarded a flight to her native @entity19 with her 14 - year - old daughter			1
@entity22 officers told her she was a terrorist watch - list , but then said it was a mistake and that she was clear to fly , reports the @entity26			2
when she tried to return from @entity19 two months later , she was told that her student visa had been revoked under a terrorism law			1
@entity30 , a scholar from @entity19 living in the @entity13 on a student visa - had been fighting the federal government for years trying to figure out why she was placed on the @entity33 @entity15 and her daughter were deported back to @entity19 , where they are believed to have remained since			1
@entity13 district judge @entity36 of @entity16 presided over @entity15 's trial , which was the first - ever challenge to the no - fly list and held behind behind closed doors because of the government 's insistence on secrecy			2
on thursday @entity43 released most of his 38 - page ruling			0
he found that the government had violated @entity15 ’s rights , has admitted that she poses no threat to national security and must allow her to apply for re-entry to the @entity13 but he did n’t order her readmitted and said such decisions are within the government ’s discretion			0
@entity43 said the reason for the initial mistake was that @entity8 special agent @entity57 , who was investigating @entity15 for reasons the government wo n’t disclose , had ' misunderstood the directions ' on a government form and ' checked the wrong boxes ' — ignoring written instructions that she should not be placed on the no - fly list , according to @entity26			1
@entity43 did n’t say what boxes @entity57 was supposed to check or why			0
where it all started : @entity11 was flying from @entity69 to @entity19 with her daughter in january 2005 when the problem first started			1
she was arrested and detained for two hours ' this was no minor human error but an error with palpable impact , leading to the humiliation , cuffing , and incarceration of an innocent and incapacitated air traveler , ' @entity43 said , noting that @entity15 was then using a wheelchair after undergoing surgery			0
' whether true or not , she reasonably suspects that ( her current travel restrictions ) are traceable to the original wrong that placed her on the no - fly list			2
' the judge said the @entity13 government must clear up @entity15 ’s records and tell her whether she is back on the terrorist watch - list			0
but he said the government still has the authority to deny a visa to @entity15 , after reviewing her forthcoming application , and there ’s not much that the courts could do about it			0
@entity15 is now a professor and dean of a college of design and architecture in @entity19 .			0
