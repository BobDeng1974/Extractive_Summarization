by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 17 july 2013 it 's not unusual for traffic wardens to be on the receiving end of abuse from the public as they dish out parking tickets and clamp poorly - parked cars			2
but when traffic stopped for a row in @entity11 , @entity12 , it was because it was between two traffic wardens			1
the female officers were caught on camera as they fought on the job while they were supposed to be directing traffic during rush hour			1
the pair hit and punched each other in the head and face , knocking off their white caps and ignoring the cars that honked as they drove past			2
they are stopped by another female officer , who leaves her post across the road , marches over to the pair and grabs them by the arms			0
as she reprimands them , the officers continue to grab each others ' hair			0
vicious : the women slapped each other and threw punches			0
they were fired the next day because of their unprofessional behaviour break it up ! another officer intervenes to separate the women , who squirm under her grip dressing down : the women are reprimanded by their colleague , who wears the same white and navy outfit			0
she left her post directing traffic to resolve the fight calm after the storm : an officer in a navy uniform gives the women a stern telling off according to @entity79 , the traffic police assistants were hired to help police direct the traffic and are not full time employees			1
assistant officers are used on the busy roads of @entity12 's major cities , which are prone to congestion			1
the dispute , which turned into a street brawl , broke out just before 9am on july 8			0
local police told @entity79 that the women were fired following the fight .			2
