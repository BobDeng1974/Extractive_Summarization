by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 4 december 2013 a @entity2 artist has found a bizarre way to create colourful floor tiles – by using snail poo			1
@entity6 thought of the concept when she noticed a plague of snails in her garden who enjoyed eating paper and cardboard			1
the designer noticed that snails not only ate coloured paper , but also recycled it in that same colour because their bodies reject the colour pigments			1
@entity6 thought of the idea to create these coloured tiles when she noticed a plague of snails in her garden who enjoyed eating paper and cardboard the snails are fed paper which they then excrete			1
the waste product is coloured because the snail 's body rejects the paper 's pigments			2
the poo , which has a malleable texture , is the collected and fed it into a specially - designed portable machine that mixes and presses it into floor tiles of the same colour			2
the faeces can also be pressed into a mould using a spatula to create delicate 5 - mm thick thread			0
one metre of thread takes around an hour to create and contains six grams of snail excrement that is ground before processing			0
to see how colourful the poo could be , ms @entity6 brought close to a thousand snails and built a laboratory test that measured the colour of snail poo based on the type of paper eaten			1
‘ walking outside , in the garden or on the streets , we are constantly walking on snail excrement , ’ said ms @entity6			2
‘ but because these excrements are very small and look like normal dirt , we are not aware of this			0
this made me think of a situation where these excrements are in colour			0

‘ my work is not only about rational results , but also on the image and associated power of the image , ’ said ms @entity6			0
‘ the photos of defecating snails are therefore part of the project			0
’ the project will be presented at an exhibition called @entity112 at @entity113 in @entity114 , which continues until 5 january 2014 .			0

a @entity2 artist found noticed that when snails ate blue paper in left in her garden , their poo also comes out the same colour
@entity6 *set* up a study to see what colours snails could create
she is now *harvesting* snail poo to make into floor tiles and coloured thread
