one by one , they take their turn in front of the camera ; flaunting a red shirt , striking a pose , striving for a smile which smacks of pride			2
some are familiar , others are little more than rumours , but each comes with the personal endorsement of @entity13 , and their collective cost is stratospheric			1
when finally they are gathered together in one place , they will put on those red shirts and call themselves ‘ @entity18 ’			1
so let ’s hear it for @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and , if terms can be settled , @entity19 and @entity20			1
you may recall that @entity32 enjoyed a rather successful season ; so successful , in fact , that @entity13 decided to buy them			1
he may have missed out on one or two players , but in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 he purchased the heart and soul of a club which was embarrassingly eager to sell hearts , souls and practically anything else which could be converted into cash			1
some of the others do not trip off the tongue			2
@entity28 , whose surname is destined to inspire a thousand predictable headlines , is a 20 - year - old , bought from @entity57 for £ 10 million			1
@entity26 , also 20 , cost £ 20m from @entity58 , and @entity59 came from @entity60 for £ 10m			1
it would be unfair to suggest that his talents are not widely renowned , but the official @entity18 website is carrying a feature called ‘ the @entity65 ’			1
it runs for 57 seconds			2
potential : @entity27 joined the @entity68 club after a couple of impressive showings at the @entity71 international : @entity59 , centre , helped @entity74 advance to the last - 16 of the tournament in @entity76 still , @entity13 , their manager , believes that @entity78 is ‘ exciting ’ , @entity26 is ‘ really exciting ’ , while @entity59 has the potential to become ‘ world - class ’			1
in any case , in the moment that shirt is pulled over their heads , they will instantly become heirs to the legacy of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , celebrated in song and in story , revered legends of the @entity95			0
for they are @entity18 ’s summer signings , the best that £ 100m can buy			1
now , in a league which contains the two @entity104 clubs , along with the likes of @entity100 and @entity101 , it may seem unfair to concentrate on @entity18 ’s spending			1
in a relatively short spell as a @entity108 manager , @entity13 has espoused civilised principles and created teams who play with flair and invention			1
his methods have been admirably supported by fans and board alike			0
in a fairer world , the club might well be entering the new season as defending champions			1
so we can have no quarrel with @entity18			1
imminent buy : @entity19 , of @entity123 , is said to be on the brink of completing a move to @entity126 graceful : @entity13 has been effusive in his praise of @entity26 , right , since he joined the club no , it is the system which makes us uncomfortable			1
when @entity132 offered @entity18 £ 75m for @entity133 , @entity13 — if dear @entity133 will forgive the phrase — bit their hands off			1
but with that £ 75m burning a hole in their pockets , what did they decided to do ? for instance , did they even briefly consider lowering admission prices to make @entity126 more accessible to hard - pressed followers ? not at all			2
they did what every other club does			2
they spent it ; further enriching a flock of wealthy young men , a gaggle of grasping owners , and a plague of parasitical agents			0
it all felt a touch knee - jerk , automatic , the kind of thing that long ago @entity161 winners used to do when the man from @entity163 came knocking			0
i spend , therefore i am			0
naturally , the chosen ones were at pains to declare their loyalty			0
@entity25 described his move as ‘ a dream come true ’ , while @entity23 announced : ‘ this means everything to me			1
’ @entity19 and @entity20 have yet to effuse but @entity13 himself set the gold standard for gush when he referred to @entity24 as ‘ a great human being ’			1
' a great human being ' : the @entity18 boss has also spoken very highly of @entity24 , left join the club : @entity28 , a purchase from @entity57 , controls the ball against @entity180 of course , all managers feel obliged to hurl superlatives at their acquisitions , in the knowledge that they will be judged by the players they have bought			1
i daresay that @entity188 paid fulsome tribute to the silken touch of @entity191 and @entity192 when he flourished @entity18 ’s chequebook in that long - distant winter			2
but the description of @entity24 seems a little excessive , even if you have just laid out £ 25m for his services			2
in the midst of all this conspicuous consumption , @entity198 said something interesting			0
interviewed on @entity18 ’s pre-season tour of @entity205 , the @entity203 midfield player declared his determination to ‘ carry on from last season			1
to keep learning from the people around me , keep getting better all the time ’			0
stuck in the middle : @entity198 , one of @entity18 's stars last year , could find himself pushed out smiling now : @entity213 led @entity18 to within a few points of the title last season he added : ‘ we can take a lot of confidence from last season because we played so much good football			1
we went on such a long , unbeaten run ... we were so close to winning the league			2
@entity133 was a huge factor , of course , but so too were names such as @entity213 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity198 himself			2
they now enter a new season knowing their manager thinks there was nothing much wrong last time that six or seven vastly expensive new players wo n’t fix in the months ahead			2
a gesture of faith in the old guard would have been certainly cheaper and possibly more effective			0
incidentally , @entity13 is reported to be in the market for a new striker			1
inevitably costly , hopefully a great human being			0
with perfect wrist action , subtle @entity243 made his point when the test was won and the series was squared , @entity243 found himself at the centre of attention			0
six @entity251 wickets had secured him the spotlight , and while he did not relish the fuss , he fulfilled his duties with appealing grace			0
the noises off were fascinating			0
@entity257 , having earlier described @entity243 as a ‘ part - time spin bowler ’ , was hurriedly reclassifying			0
the selectors were congratulating each other on their perspicacity and the @entity263 public was celebrating the pivotal part which @entity243 had played in a rare and precious victory			0
proving a point : @entity203 bowler @entity243 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity269 batsman @entity268 @entity243 wore the air of a man enjoying a private joke , the way he had reacted three days earlier when the world was staring at his wrist			0
he knew precisely what convulsions he would cause by walking out to play for @entity203 while wearing wristbands which bore the slogans ‘ @entity279 ’ and ‘ @entity280 ’			0
@entity281 , the former @entity203 bowler , announced that @entity282 had been ‘ a silly boy ’ and patronisingly informed him that sport and politics do not mix. some of us recalled the sentiment from the days of cricket ’s apartheid tours and it was as fatuous then as it is now			0
more interestingly , the @entity290 declined to ban the bands , on the grounds that they were not a political slogan but a humanitarian statement and by the time the @entity295 eventually forbade the wearing of such adornments , @entity243 had made his point and had tapped into the widespread sympathy for his cause			0
match - winner : @entity243 holds up the match ball as he celebrates his fifth wicket , bowling out @entity303 the entire operation was conducted with the finesse of a diplomat and the fact that the wristbands were quietly set aside next day only enhanced the subtlety of his argument			2
of course , there are those who may never be completely reconciled to the sight of a man with a beard as bushy as @entity316 representing @entity203			0
mercifully , their numbers are few and are swiftly diminishing			0
for the fact remains that , in the space of a single week , @entity243 has won a reputation which far outstrips his wicket - taking or run - making abilities			0
these are early days , but one suspects that before his career is done this formidable @entity325 muslim may well emerge as one of the most significant figures in @entity263 sport .			0

@entity13 has signed @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 for @entity18 this summer
@entity126 side look set to add @entity19 and @entity20 to that list
the big spending by @entity18 puts huge pressure on the set of players that came so close to winning the @entity108 last season
@entity68 club are also said to still be interested in signing another striker
