by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 05:42 est , 14 october 2013 the dust has barely settled since last week 's launch of @entity4 's new iphones , but that has n't stopped the rumour mill starting up again - this time about the imminent arrival of a second - generation ipad mini as well as an @entity9 5			1
reports suggest that @entity4 will launch successors to its current range of tablets at an event on 15 october , and leaked photos hint at what the tablets could look like , including a range of colourful cases			1
the speculation comes as sales figures show @entity4 's gamble with colourful @entity3 is paying off , with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined			1
almost half of @entity28 sales are of the pink model , according to @entity30			2
the blue model is second most - popular , accounting for 32 per cent of @entity28 sales			1
in third place is green , at 12 per cent , followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear , accounting for just 1 per cent of sales the plastic @entity28 range , pictured , is the first time @entity4 has released its handsets in a selection of colours			1
the strategy was used on earlier ipods , and @entity4 may be looking to follow suit with a range of colourful @entity9 5s , or at least more colourful cases , according to leaked images @entity4 announced it has smashed its own records by selling nine million @entity50 and @entity28 handsets during the first three days - working out as 125,000 an hour , on average , or around 2083 a minute			1
the tech giant also announced that 200 million devices are now running the @entity55 software , despite download problems and divided opinion			0
last year 's iphone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in september 2012 , yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year 's two - and it was n't sold in @entity62 from launch			2
reports from @entity65 found that the blue model is the second most - popular device , accounting for 32 per cent of @entity28 sales			1
in third place is green , at 12 per cent , followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear , accounting for just 1 per cent of sales			2
@entity4 could be looking to take this strategy into the @entity9 part of the business			2
experts have already said there could be at least two new @entity77 released as soon as next month			0
@entity4 is yet to officially confirm the date of its next product launch , but analysts have begun pointing towards the 15 october			1
during the @entity28 announcement on 10 september , @entity4 's ceo @entity81 said : ' our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware , software and services that we ca n’t wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014			0
' the current ipad mini came out in november 2012 and if @entity4 follows suit , this would suggest a mid-october announcement followed by an early - november sale date , all in time for @entity93			1
the price of the current @entity77 is also being cut in various regions , suggesting a new tablet is coming			0
a new range of @entity77 are expected to launch on 22 october			0
these leaked images from technology site @entity99 , allegedly show the rear shell of the @entity9 5 , pictured , with coloured cases			1
@entity4 could also unveil a second - generation ipad mini it 's likely the ipad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9 - inch screen and not drop to 7 - inches , in a bid to stay slightly bigger than @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity111 's new @entity110			1
if @entity4 adds the @entity113 seen on its new iphones and larger @entity77 , its possible the second - generation ipad mini will be heavier and thicker			2
however , leaked photos of casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting @entity4 will wait to add the high - definition display to later models			1
according to @entity4 site , @entity120 , the rumoured @entity9 will also keep the 9.7 - inch , high - resolution screen seen on older models			0
the camera is due an upgrade and is rumoured to move to an @entity127 rear - facing lens , with the possibility of even a @entity130 camera being added			0

the camera is due an upgrade and is rumoured to move to an @entity127 rear - facing lens , with the possibility of even a @entity130 camera being added leaked images from @entity99 additionally suggest the @entity9 5 will be thinner than its predecessors			1
technology site @entity140 believes @entity4 will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models			0
for example , the @entity146 is expected to cost around £ 399 , this raises to £ 479 for @entity148 and £ 559 for @entity149			0
if @entity4 additionally follows its ipad 4 launch and introduces a @entity152 ipad 5 model , this should start at around £ 639 for @entity152 , while @entity154 - ready models will cost more still			2
similarly , the ipad mini is expected to launch with at around £ 269 for @entity156 and then in £ 80 increments for the @entity158 and @entity149 models			2
models with @entity161 and @entity162 will cost more			0
because the colourful @entity3 have proved so popular , case manufacturer @entity164 has created a range of cases in purple , green , pink , red and blue for the older @entity28			0
the cases are known as juice packs because they can also be used to give the phone a battery boost			0
@entity164 claims the cases offer 80 per cent more power			0
