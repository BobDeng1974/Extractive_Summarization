published : 17:32 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 17:32 est , 15 october 2013 the study rated key aspects of care including support for families and control of symptoms breathlessness the controversial @entity8 has little clinical benefit for dying patients , according to a major new trial			0
based on findings published in @entity14 , the researchers suggest that any initiative to replace the @entity8 ( @entity16 ) in @entity17 should be ' grounded in scientific evidence ' and tested in controlled trials before it is implemented			1
the @entity16 was jointly developed by the @entity20 and the @entity21 in the late 1990s with the aim of rolling out the best practice of hospices to hospitals , to provide uniform , high - quality , dignified care for dying patients in the last days or hours of life			1
however , its effectiveness for improving care for the dying has not been assessed in a randomised trial until now			0
in the study , the @entity35 assessed the impact of the @entity39 version of the @entity16 ( @entity40 ) on the quality of care of adult patients dying with cancer and their families in 16 general medicine hospital wards across @entity39			1
@entity48 and palliative care teams chosen at random , were trained in the @entity16 - i programme or to follow standard healthcare practice			0
bereaved family members of cancer patients were interviewed within four months of their relative 's death , and the quality of end - of - life care assessed using a scale of 0 to 100			2
they rated key aspects of care including information and decision - making , co-ordination of care , support for families , and control of symptoms such as pain and breathlessness			0
no significant differences in the overall quality of care between the wards in which the @entity16 - i was implemented and the control wards was noted			1
and two dimensions assessed - respect , dignity , and kindness and control of breathlessness - also showed some improvement in the @entity16 - i wards			0
no significant differences in the overall quality of care between the wards in which the @entity39 version of the @entity16 was implemented and the control wards was noted however , no differences in survival times between patients in @entity16 - i and control wards were noted			1
study leader dr @entity91 said : ' although we found no significant difference in overall quality of care for those on the @entity97 , we did see a small improvement			2
this could indicate that the @entity16 - i may have the potential to close the gap between hospice care and hospital care as we know families rate quality of hospice care more highly			2
while the results of this trial should be interpreted with caution because there were slightly fewer participants than expected , and we observed some variability in implementation of the @entity16 between the hospitals , this is a robust trial and the findings should be used to inform strategies to care for dying patients			2
' there could be fundamental components of the @entity16 that might be beneficial , and the next steps are to establish this			0
' professor @entity126 , co-author of the study and director of the @entity129 at @entity130 , said : ' our findings demonstrate just how important it is for any initiative that replaces the @entity16 in @entity17 to be grounded in scientific evidence and tested in controlled trials before being rolled out across the board			1
' we must face this challenge head - on and ensure scientific evidence forms the foundations for any new initiative if end - of - life care is to be genuinely improved for patients and their families in @entity17			1
' commenting on the findings , @entity146 , of @entity147 in @entity148 , and @entity149 , from @entity150 in the @entity151 , said : ' across healthcare there is a need to improve care for people who are dying , which has led to widespread uptake of the @entity8 before adequate assessment			0
' a decade after widespread uptake , the results of this , the only adequately powered study of @entity16 so far have not shown clinically meaningful differences for patients - the ultimate measure of useful health policy			0

study compared care provided under the @entity39 version of the @entity16 and hospitals that do not implement the program as end of life care in @entity39
found ' no significant differences ' in quality of care between the wards
suggested that any initiative to replace the @entity16 in @entity17 should be ' grounded in scientific evidence ' before it is implemented
