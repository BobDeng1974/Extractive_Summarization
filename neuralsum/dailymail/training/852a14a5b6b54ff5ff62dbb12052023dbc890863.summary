battle : @entity27 forces clash with @entity13 during the @entity28 in 1645			1
the @entity29 in 1644 was regarded as one of the key turning points in the war battlefield : the fighting , which happened over ten days in 1644 , occurred close to @entity20 on the outskirts of @entity14 , @entity15 they have now been added to the @entity37 which protects historically significant sites from development			1
the @entity11 , who had around 12,000 footmen and 7,000 cavalry , pursued the outnumbered parliamentarians to the outskirts of the town			2
when the @entity47 invaded @entity15 , a @entity11 stronghold , he wrongly believed that he would have significant support in the area			1
although he had around 10,000 men under his command , and at the end of the two battles which lasted 10 days , they were forced to surrender			2
the @entity56 eventually fled the site in a fishing boat			2
@entity3 i was present during the battle and is said to have slept with his troops under a hedge			0
@entity63 , an @entity9 designation team leader , said that the victory for @entity3 i was one of the key battles in the @entity7 between 1642 and 1651			1
artifacts : remains of @entity7 weapons found in a field near @entity14 , @entity15 , which have enabled experts to pinpoint exactly where the battle in 1644 was fought weaponry : these are thought to be round shot ( left ) and musket balls ( right ) which were recovered from a field @entity7 turning point : this is a lead cannon shot recovered from the field near @entity14 battlefield : a sign at @entity82 which marks the victory of the @entity11 over the @entity13 in the battle in 1644 battlefields : the spots where fighting occurred during the two battles in 1644			1
the sites are now on an @entity9 register which helps protect them against future development ' the @entity14 campaign of 1644 was one of the most wide - ranging battles of the civil war , marking a turning point in the war by delivering a @entity27 victory , thus prolonging the war for several more bloody years , ' she said			1
' we are pleased that the significance of this decisive battle , to the south west and the nation , is recognised through designation			0
' it is appropriate that such an important battle becomes the first addition to the list for some years			0
' the addition of the two sites takes the total number of sites on the @entity9 register to 45			1
@entity116 , chairman of the @entity21 said : ' these are the first battlefields to be registered in @entity118 since 1995 and shows that the @entity119 is a living document			0
fighting : the battles took place on land surrounding @entity20 ( pictured ) in 1644 civil war : the battle took place near @entity14 , @entity15 , in 1644 as the @entity13 invaded the county which was loyal to the @entity11 ' we have asked @entity9 to look at registering other battlefields , including the @entity131 site at @entity132			1
' we hope @entity9 resolves these requests in the same positive way			1
' the @entity14 sites were not originally included on the register because it was unclear exactly where the battles took place			1
the registration of the battlefield does not mean development on the site is forbidden , but the status of the site must be taken into consideration			1
troops : roundhead soldiers - troops loyal to thwe @entity13 - during the @entity7			1
at the @entity29 they had around 12,000 footmen the @entity21 explained that the government 's @entity151 says that development of historic battlefields should be ' wholly exceptional '			2
@entity21 development officer @entity155 said : ' development and unsystematic metal detecting without professional archaeological input are the main threats to battlefields in the @entity161			2
' but designation ( as a battlefield ) offers no absolute protection from either			0
' battlefields are ultimately local issues and having people who who own or live near battlefields interested in them is the best form of protection and that 's what the @entity21 is all about			0
' when @entity3 took the throne in 1625 , his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent when @entity3 took the throne in 1625 , his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent			0
his was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule			0
this bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of @entity118 , while in @entity191 tensions with the @entity118 boiled over into bloody conflict			0
the embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640 , and within this a vocal and highly critical @entity196 faction began to grow			0
when a violent @entity200 rebellion broke out in @entity201 , disagreements over how to respond split @entity118 in two , and in 1642 the @entity7 broke out			0
the @entity11 , based largely in the north and west , fought for the king , while the @entity204 , also known as @entity13 , came mainly from the south and east			2
they took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair , which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly @entity11			0
the battles that followed saw @entity3 's forces , bolstered by the @entity214 and @entity215 , clash with a @entity204 army swollen with @entity217			2
the @entity11 looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643 , until their enemies joined forces with the @entity191			0
in 1644 , the king 's men suffered a crushing defeat at @entity224 , @entity225 , effectively conceding the north			2
a further loss at @entity28 , @entity228 , was the final nail in the coffin			0
