@entity0 had two goals ruled out in controversial fashion as @entity3 were denied a @entity5 victory over @entity6 at the @entity7			1
the @entity9 striker had given @entity11 's side the lead in first - half injury - time - but either side of that he had two efforts ruled out for offside , with television replays suggesting they should have stood			1
and @entity18 's side secured a 1 - 1 draw as former @entity3 player @entity20 netted emphatically from the spot in the 54th minute , after @entity22 had been tripped by @entity23			1
@entity0 scores the opening goal for @entity3 in their championship clash with @entity6 @entity0 celebrates scoring in first - half injury time at the @entity7 on saturday afternoon @entity6 forward @entity20 equalises from the penalty spot in the 54th minute of the match the visiting players congratulate @entity20 after he scored against his old club @entity31 was taken off injured in the first half and replaced by @entity33 @entity6 goalkeeper @entity34 produced a string of outstanding saves to hold @entity3 at bay as the home side pushed for a winner			1
the two major incidents of the first half both involved @entity0 prodding home from close range			2
in the 22nd minute , the striker found the back of the net from close range , when he deflected a @entity48 cross-shot beyond keeper @entity34 - only to see his effort ruled out for offside			0
it looked a close decision and replays suggested that it was a wrong one , as @entity22 looked to have played @entity0 onside			0
the former @entity57 man was not to be denied for a second time , however , and when he forced the ball home in similar circumstances at the end of the first half , this time there was to be no intervention from the officials			0
this time it was a header from @entity67 that @entity0 steered into the back of the net , from close range , to give the home side the lead			2
while @entity3 will have felt a sense of injustice at having a goal ruled out , @entity6 will themselves have been scratching heir heads over how they had not scored			1
@entity6 president @entity77 hides his head in his hands while watching the match goal scorer @entity0 chases former @entity82 and @entity83 defender @entity81 in the first half former @entity85 midfielder @entity84 tries to protect the ball from @entity6 midfielder @entity87 @entity88 of @entity6 pulls on @entity90 's shirt as he attempts to tackle the @entity3 man @entity92 heads the ball while being slapped in the face by midfielder @entity84 in the 14th minute , @entity88 saw a driven shot , from the periphery of the box , take a massive deflection that sent it spinning inches wide of the post			1
almost immediately afterwards , @entity101 's shot was brilliantly saved by @entity102 , who should have been beaten when the ball rebounded to @entity104 , just a few yards out - but the defender skied his shot wildly over the bar			0
@entity6 did draw level after the break , as @entity23 stuck out a leg to trip @entity22 , with referee @entity111 pointing to the spot			0
@entity20 blasted the spot - kick down the middle			2
this sparked @entity3 into life , with the home side coming close to scoring three times			2
@entity90 shot straight at the keeper when he might have done better , @entity119 forced a superb save with a driven shot and @entity122 sent a free header over the bar			0
then came another moment of controversy , as @entity0 had another goal chalked off for a debatable offside decision , again @entity3 thought the goal should have stood			1
in the space of a few minutes @entity122 , @entity84 and @entity119 were denied by outstanding stops from @entity34 , who was in inspired form			0
however , @entity102 had to make a strong save of his own at the other end in the closing stages , to prevent @entity20 snatching all three points for the visitors .			0

@entity3 's @entity31 went off injured in the first half
@entity0 opened the scoring in first - half injury time
