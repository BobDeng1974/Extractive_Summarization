@entity3 , 42 , kissed and led the child away while she was deciding how to spend her pocket money in the gift shop at the world famous @entity16 tourist attraction			1
the ' highly predatory ' paedophile is believed to have lived in the country illegally for 13 years prior to the offence but shortly after being arrested claimed asylum in the hope of avoiding deportation			1
after pinning the child in a corner of the gift shop , @entity3 began touching her chest until a group of @entity31 tourists stopped him , @entity24 heard			1
@entity33 , judge @entity34 said : ' this defendant had been , in the time preceding the commission of these offences , in the habit of going to @entity6			0
' @entity39 , prosecuting , told the court that since his arrest , @entity3 had applied for asylum			1
she said : ' he is an @entity8 national known to the immigration authorities			0
at the time of his arrest he had not made a claim for asylum and had failed to sign with the immigration authorities			2
' he apparently has now made a claim and that is being considered , ' she added			0
however , @entity52 , defending , said his client intended to return home after serving his sentence			0
he said : ' the fact of the matter is , this man has been in this country since 2001			0
he has no convictions recorded against him for anything of this nature - either violent or sexual			1
' he added : ' once he has served his sentence , and he has already served several months , he wants to return to @entity8			0
' ' he realises that his life is not well here and he wants to return to his home country where his mother and sisters are			2
' @entity69 evidence showed @entity70 had spent a ' significant period ' of time in the waxwork museum ’s coffee and gift shops , with no apparent purpose on august 5 last year			1
describing the moments before the attack , the judge said : ' the victim asked her mother whether she could go into the gift shop			1
' she did n’t tell her why , but her planned motive was to buy a small present with her pocket money to give to her mother on her forthcoming birthday			1
' it was at this point that the @entity8 , who was living illegally in the @entity88 under the name @entity90 , saw his opportunity and approached the schoolgirl			0
no reason : @entity69 evidence showed @entity70 had spent a ' significant period ' of time in the waxwork museum 's coffee and gift shops , with no apparent purpose on august 5 last year the judge continued : ' he approached her and engaged in conversation , he offered her praise			1
' he probably kissed her in some way that was not sexual , but was designed to encourage her to believe the he was a harmless person , someone rather like a father figure			2
' he took the degree with some minor degree of force from the main body of the gift shop into part of it that was little more than an alcove			2
he took her into the corner of it which was not fully covered by @entity69			1
' ' the whole of the evidence satisfies me beyond any doubt whatever that while he had her pinned into the corner , he sexually assaulted her , ' the judge added , branding the @entity8 national a ' dangerous ' offender , the judge said he needed to be given an extended sentence for public protection			0
@entity70 , of no fixed address , was found guilty of one count of sexual assault of a child under 13 , and one count of abducting a child			1
he must serve five years in prison before being released and serving eight years on an extended licence			0
a @entity132 spokesman said he was unable to comment on whether @entity3 would be deported			2
he added , however , that any individual from outside the @entity134 that has been sentenced to more than year in prison while their asylum is pending is eligible for deportation after their term has been served			1
although the @entity132 issues automatic deportation papers to all non @entity145 convicts sentenced to more than a year in prison , hundreds of the orders are challenged on human rights grounds			2
a series of cases have emerged in which criminals including killers and rapists have successfully claimed deportation would breach their human rights , to the fury of conservative mps			2
@entity70 fled @entity6 after the group of @entity31 tourists stopped him assaulting the girl , but returned a few days later and was arrested			1
the judge said : ' this was not in any sense a chance encounter ... whatever he may have been doing on previous day with whatever motivation , on this day i have no doubt at all that he was where he was , doing what he did , because he was in a manner that was highly predatory awaiting the arrival , if it were to happen , of a child who he could make his victim			0
' he added : ' this child has been significantly harmed by what happened and there is at least a risk that that harm will persist as she grows up and matures			0
it is to be profoundly wished that she can overcome it			0
' return : @entity70 fled @entity6 ( pictured ) after the group of @entity31 tourists stopped him assaulting the girl , but came back a few days later and was arrested the judge praised the child for the ' immense fortitude ' she had shown in giving evidence during the trial			1
in court @entity39 , prosecuting , read a statement the victim 's mother had prepared on behalf of her daughter , saying she had since lost confidence and become unable to leave her mother ’s side			2
ms @entity39 continued : ' she [ the victim ’s mother ] said , she [ the victim ] is wary of men and men of particular ethnic origin , which was n’t the case before this incident			0
' the now 10 - year - old ’s mother also provided a statement to the court			1
ms @entity39 said : ' she says she feels blame , guilt and anger and upset as a result			0
' ' she also says that she felt ashamed and embarrassed that this had happened to her daughter when she was in her care			0
' she says it is hard to put her trust in people , and the world , because her trust has really been rocked to the core			0
' defending , @entity52 said the abduction committed by his client only resulted in the child being taken ' a few yards ' from the ' chocolate section of the gift shop over to the marbles section '			1
while accepting that @entity70 had still not admitted his actions , he added : ' he was at the time down on his luck			2
' ' he had been badly assaulted in the spring and had to have operations on his face			0
he had lost his job - he had been working on the market , he was having to sleep rough			0
' alongside his five year sentence , @entity3 was made subject to a sexual offences prevention order until further notice			1
the order states he must not contact children under the age of 16 , must not engage in conversation with children under the age of 16 , and must not work in an environment where he would come into contact with anyone under 16 .			0
