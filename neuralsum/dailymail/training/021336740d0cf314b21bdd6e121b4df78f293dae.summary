@entity1 manager @entity0 believes his side can now compete with the best clubs in @entity4 for some of the game 's big names			1
on tuesday @entity0 signed @entity9 international and @entity11 defender @entity10 on loan until the end of the season , with a view to a permanent move in the summer			1
more surprisingly , @entity1 were this week linked with a club - record deal for @entity19 star @entity18 , who instead signed on loan for @entity21 from @entity22 ahead of a Â£ 12million summer switch			1
centre back @entity10 could make the move from @entity11 permanent in the summer it was no cheeky attempt by @entity0 to snatch @entity18 , who was also linked with @entity25 and @entity28 's @entity27 opponents on sunday in @entity29			1
@entity0 feels it is a measure of how far @entity1 have come throughout his tenure that agents are willing to listen to his overtures rather than snub the club			2
' we get the opportunity to discuss things at that level now , and i do n't think that was the case here before , ' said @entity0			2
' it 's fair to say in the past we 've said to agents ' we could be interested ' and the response has always been ' do n't bother '			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 had been linked with an audacious bid for @entity22 ace @entity18 ' that was probably the case in previous years , but that 's certainly changed in my time here			1
' we 've brought different types of players here and players talk			0
they understand what we 're trying to do , the football grapevine is everywhere and we become an option			0
' of course , we need to be in the top half of the table , that 's the key to it , and if you 're a consistent team you are an attraction			0
' do n't underestimate the power of the @entity27 as well			0
we can offer a good club , a well - run club , with good players already here			0
@entity0 look set for a busy january as he continues to strengthen his side during the transfer window ' it 's a good environment , a good situation to come into , with an opportunity to progress if you do well , so we 've a lot to offer if you look at all the boxes we tick			2
' it remains to be seen if @entity10 will be given his debut against @entity29 , although given @entity1 's record away to the @entity75 they need all the help they can muster			1
@entity1 have lost on their last 12 visits , be it at @entity79 or the @entity80 , with their last success in that part of @entity83 dating all the way back to 1981			2
@entity0 is hoping the stunning 3 - 2 success over @entity87 's side just five weeks ago at the @entity88 in early december will play a part			2
@entity90 ( left ) will be joined in defence by fellow @entity92 @entity10 who joins the @entity93 on loan ' if you look at our record at @entity29 it is n't great , and neither is my own personal record with other teams before @entity1 , ' said @entity0			1
' but this is an opportunity for us as we 're playing them quickly after a very positive performance and result last month			0
' hopefully , from a psychological point of view , it might help us more than @entity29			0
we hope it 's a benefit			0
' we certainly have to improve our record down there , and if we are to do that then we have to force them to work harder than they have done in the past			0
' @entity0 has four players on the brink of a comeback from injury in defenders @entity118 and @entity120 , midfielder @entity121 and striker @entity122			1
@entity1 duo @entity122 and @entity118 are closing in on a comeback as they return from injury			1

@entity0 made the comments despite *missing* out on @entity18
*ex-man* @entity28 boss *bolstered* squad with signing of @entity10
the @entity92 centre back could make his @entity1 debut against @entity29
@entity122 , @entity118 and @entity120 close to return to first team
