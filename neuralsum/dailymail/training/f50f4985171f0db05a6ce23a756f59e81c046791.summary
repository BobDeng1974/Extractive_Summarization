' i thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters			1
but what he did to me in the attic felt different , ' she said			0
what followed next was a drawn - out process in which @entity12 was dragged from one psychologist to the next , recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying			0

on the night of the @entity53 ceremony , @entity149 , @entity3 's would - be son , brought up his sister 's alleged assault in a scathing tweet			1
' missed the @entity3 tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after @entity85 ? ' the newly hired @entity157 host wrote			2
