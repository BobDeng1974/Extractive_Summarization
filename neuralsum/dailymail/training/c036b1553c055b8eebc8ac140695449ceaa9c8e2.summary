@entity1 supporters are threatening to withdraw backing from the conservatives at the next election unless ministers act to ease the hunting ban			1
as more than 250,000 people across the country gather for the traditional @entity10 meets , supporters are said to be ‘ exasperated ’ by the @entity11 ’ failure to see through a pledge to hold a @entity15 vote on scrapping the ban			2
many of those taking part in events on the biggest day of the hunting calendar are likely to be children – some as young as five – reflecting the growth of a new generation of supporters spurred on by the ban			1
@entity28 - @entity27 , seven , on horse @entity29 and her brother @entity31 , 11 , on horse @entity32 pictured prior to the @entity1 in @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 , aged one , at one of her first hunts ( right ) the @entity39 said hunts had attracted increasing numbers of children since the sport ’s profile was raised by the 2004 @entity45 that banned hunting foxes with a pack of hounds			1
membership of the @entity50 has more than doubled since the ban to more than 1,000 members , with children as young as five attending regular meets			1
@entity54 , the hunt ’s chairman , said : ‘ there are more people taking part now than before the ban			2
we have seen a marked increase in children coming along with their parents or minders			2
’ most of the gatherings practise trail - hunting , where huntsmen follow a trail across the countryside laid with a rag steeped in fox scent			1
environment secretary @entity72 has dismayed the hunting community by indicating there is no imminent prospect of the @entity11 delivering on their manifesto pledge to hold a vote on repealing the hunting ban			1
mr @entity72 has pointed to the fact that many @entity80 , and some @entity11 , do not support repeal , adding : ‘ there ’s only a point having a vote if you ’re going to win			0
’ but he is also accused of prevaricating over a plan to ‘ relax ’ one element of the ban , which supporters say would help control fox numbers			1
11 - year - old @entity91 out hunting in the @entity93 countryside mr @entity72 has now been warned that he needs to make it clear by the end of next month that he will deliver on the issue , or face the potential desertion of hunt supporters at the election			1
@entity11 mp @entity100 , a former chief executive of the @entity39 , acknowledged that the patience of rural supporters was wearing thin			1
he said hunting was one of a number of factors fuelling ‘ disgruntlement ’ , along with issues like planning reforms , wind farms and @entity111			2
he said : ‘ if you are a rural voter and activist who turned out to help in 2010 with a spring in your step for the new dawn the @entity3 were promising , do you still feel the same way ? no , you do n’t , and there is only so much you can blame the @entity80 for			0
’ mr @entity72 and mr @entity119 have both publicly voiced support for the idea of a small relaxation in the hunting ban , which would allow farmers to use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it			2
one senior figure in the hunting community said : ‘ our people have had a bellyful			0
we ’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers , but they have n’t actually lifted a finger to help us			0
we want this relaxation and it is completely deliverable if they show a bit of leadership			0
’ @entity142 , 39 , and her children @entity28 , seven , and @entity31 , 11 , are all involved with the @entity1 in @entity34			0
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ they love it – they want to go out as often as they can			0
it is a family day out			0
’ @entity150 - @entity149 , who runs the @entity151 selling hunting clothes and equipment in @entity154 , @entity155 , said : ‘ we have been providing more and more for children – from about the age of eight upwards			1
‘ with our local hunt , the @entity159 and @entity160 , i know there is a tremendous amount of children out , many more then i remember from when i was young			0
’ @entity165 , of the @entity39 , said the ban needed to be scrapped because no fewer foxes were being killed now than before it was introduced			1
she said : ‘ they get shot by farmers as they still have to reduce the number of foxes out on the land			0
we believe hunting is a very humane and natural way to get rid of them			0
’ while welcoming the surge in support for the sport , she said hunting was different than before the ban			2
‘ it is now much more predictable – it takes out the element of not knowing what is going to happen , ’ she said .			0
