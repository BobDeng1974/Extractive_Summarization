a member of the grand jury that declined to indict the @entity3 police officer who fatally shot 18 - year - old @entity4 asked a federal court monday to remove a lifetime gag order preventing jurors from discussing the case			1
the @entity9 filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of @entity15 law by doing so			1
the lawsuit also questions @entity19 prosecutor @entity18 's characterization that ' all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges			1
' scroll down to read full lawsuit ... misleading ? the @entity9 filed the lawsuit on behalf of an unnamed juror who wants to speak about the investigation but would be in violation of @entity15 law by doing so			1
the juror also claims prosecutor @entity18 misled the panel in @entity33 's favor the suit was filed against @entity18 , who oversaw the investigation , because his office would be responsible for bringing charges against the juror , according to the @entity9			1
@entity18 's spokesman , @entity38 , said his office had not seen the lawsuit and declined immediate comment			1
' right now there are only 12 people who ca n't talk about the evidence out there , ' @entity9 attorney @entity41 said			0
' the people who know the most — those 12 people are sworn to secrecy			0
what ( the grand juror ) wants is to be able to be part of the conversation			2
' the suit does not seek to allow grand jurors in all @entity15 cases to be free to discuss proceedings			1
but it argues that the @entity3 case was unique , and that allowing the juror to speak would benefit the national debate about race and police tactics that was sparked by the shooting			1
@entity4 , who was black , was unarmed when he was fatally shot after a confrontation in august with then - @entity3 police officer @entity33 , who resigned from the department late last year			2
@entity18 , prosecutor in the @entity33 case , speaks to reporters in august how many jurors serve on a @entity15 grand jury ? twelve jurors serve on a @entity15 grand jury panel			1
how many votes are needed to indict ? in order for a grand jury in the state of @entity15 to indict , nine out of 12 jurors must vote to ' hand up ' the case			1
whose ultimate decision is it for a case to move forward ? only the jury may choose to indict			0
however , the prosecuting attorney 's wish to ( or not to ) indict is extremely influential			0
per @entity85 of @entity86 : ' the prosecutor typically has de facto control over the grand jury			0
except for usually minimal instructions from the judge , the prosecutor is the only person the grand jury deals with			0
' the grand jury can decide to call witnesses on its own , but that does n't happen often			2
usually the grand jury is pretty subservient to the prosecutor			0
if prosecutor wants an indictment , he can almost always get it			0
' is a prosecutor required to hold a grand jury ? no. @entity105 juries are only guaranteed under the constitution in federal cases			0
a prosecutor may choose to forgo the process if he / she has probable cause			0
however , around half of high - level felonies and nearly all police - involved shootings go through the process			0
who gets to present evidence ? the only lawyer who presents evidence to the grand jury is the prosecutor			2
what 's more , he or she has almost unrestricted control of what evidence is presented to the jury			2
the prosecutor is the only lawyer in the room in an official capacity during the proceeding			0
source withheld evidence ? @entity19 prosecutor @entity133 takes questions after announcing the grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity33			2
a lawsuit filed by the @entity9 on monday on behalf of one of the jurors claims the prosecutor released some evidence presented during the hearing but mischaracterized it as all the evidence shooting : officer @entity33 shot @entity4 dead in august			1
a suit filed on behalf of a grand juror in the case alleges the prosecutor in the case @entity18 blamed @entity4 in the shooting as he handled the case differently from the countless others they 'd seen the shooting led to widespread unrest in an around the @entity19 suburb , including some protests that resulted in local business being burned and looted			1
protests again turned violent on nov. 24 , when @entity18 publicly announced that the grand jury investigating the case had decided there was n't enough evidence to indict @entity33			1
the grand jury — which included nine white people and three black individuals — met on 25 separate days over three months , hearing more than 70 hours of testimony from about 60 witnesses			2
those witnesses included medical examiners and experts on blood , toxicology and firearms , according to @entity18			2
the grand juror behind the lawsuit believes ' the current information available about the grand jurors ' views is not entirely accurate — especially the implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges , ' the lawsuit contends			1
' moreover , the public characterization of the grand jurors ' view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with @entity191 's own			1
' @entity41 , the @entity9 attorney , noted that the grand jury convened in may and heard hundreds of other cases before devoting its attention to the @entity33 case in august			1
protest : widespread demonstrations swept @entity198 under the ' hands up , do n't shoot ' slogan following the slaying of @entity4 , who was unarmed the suit contends that @entity18 's office handled the @entity33 case far differently than the others , with ' a stronger focus on the victim			1
' the suit also contends that legal standards were discussed in a ' muddled ' and ' untimely ' manner			1
he also said the @entity3 case was unique in how it sparked a national debate			0
' the @entity212 has said that grand jury secrecy must be weighed against the juror 's first amendment rights on a case - by - case basis , ' @entity41 said			1
' the rules of secrecy must yield because this is a highly unusual circumstance			0
the @entity220 prevents the state from imposing a lifetime gag order in cases where the prosecuting attorney has purported to be transparent			0
' @entity225 , associate professor at @entity226 and a grand jury expert , said the lawsuit will add to concerns about how the case was handled			2
" believe me , there 's already more than a fair amount of skepticism about whether this process was fair , notwithstanding mr. @entity18 's cynical attempt to pretend that it was fair , " @entity225 said			1
@entity225 believes the juror has a strong argument in the lawsuit			0
" this matter has been discussed by virtually everybody in the universe with the exception of any person actually subjected to the presentation of evidence , " he said			0
last month , state rep. @entity246 , a @entity19 @entity247 , asked a joint @entity249 and @entity250 committee to investigate whether @entity18 " manipulated " the grand jury			2
it was n't clear if the committee would take up that request			0
messages were left monday with may and state sen. @entity255 , the committee 's chairman			0
grand juror @entity258 v. @entity133 by @entity259			0

the unnamed juror argues @entity18 *insinuated* @entity4 was the *wrongdoer* and discussion of legal standards was ' muddled ' and ' untimely '
suit also *challenges* @entity18 's public ' implication that all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges ' following the no vote
' the public characterization of the grand jurors ' view of witnesses and evidence does not accord with @entity191 's own , ' reads the suit
the juror alleges @entity18 presented the case differently from all the hundreds of others the panel heard
juror contends ' heavy *redactions* and *absence* of context ' mean publicly released evidence mischaracterizes what jurors were presented
