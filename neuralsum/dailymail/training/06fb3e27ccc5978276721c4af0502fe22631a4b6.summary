police have launched a hunt for poachers who beheaded 100 deer and left the remains scattered across woodland in the @entity9 and @entity10 region of central @entity6 ( pictured ) ' we came to a clearing in the forest and just saw all these heads and bodies littered all over the place			1
' i nearly vomited , it was so gross and the smell was unbearable			2
' most of the heads had antlers missing and some of the carcasses had no legs			0
' it looked like a massacre had taken place			0
' now animal rights groups have vowed to have the people responsible brought to justice			1
a spokesman for the @entity42 , a public organisation responsible for nature and the environment , said : ' preliminary investigations suggest the animals were trapped in snow and weakened by lack of food			0
' hunters took advantage of this and killed them before chopping them up			0
' we also have reports from locals saying they had seen people driving cars full of deer heads			1
' it is not the first time in these mountains that poachers have taken advantage of the snow and killed animals that are tired and hungry			1
' but we have never seen it on this scale before			0
this type of hunting is illegal and forbidden as the animals have no chance of escape			0
' horrified ramblers stumbled upon the macabre sight during an afternoon stroll a police spokesman said they were now trying to trace the poachers			1
a local huntsman @entity81 , 49 , said : ' they call themselves hunters but this is n't hunting			0
' it is poaching at its most barbaric and it brings the sport a bad name			0
keeping down the numbers of deer is important for the environment , but it needs to be done at the right time of year , and in the right way			2
