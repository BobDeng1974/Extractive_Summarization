by @entity0 last updated at 12:22 am on 10th january 2012 new findings : researchers have discovered that babies understand what their mums say - even though they do n't know the language she is speaking babies understand what their mothers say , even when they speak in a language their children have never heard before , scientists claim			1
they found one - year - olds reacted in exactly same way to their mother ’s voice regardless of whether she was speaking in @entity19 or @entity20			1
it proves what mothers have long known – that babies pick up on tone of voice rather than the words			2
the researchers , from @entity30 ’s @entity29 , observed babies as they watched their mothers perform actions with toys using the @entity19 words ‘ whoops ’ and ‘ there ’			1
the scientists studied reactions from one - year - old babies to their mum ’s voice even when she was speaking either languages			1
. and the same process was repeated in @entity20 with the same tone in the voice			1
the academics found that babies reproduced the same reaction regardless of whether they knew the language - proving it was all @entity20 to them			1
study leader dr @entity50 , of @entity30 ’s @entity29 , said : ' what this work showed was that children could have access to understanding using simply the tone of voice			2
' we did “ whoops ” and “ there ” in two languages and got exactly the same results - whether in @entity19 or @entity20 , which none of the children understood			1
' the research published in the journal @entity66 was conducted with 84 babies , aged between 14 and 18 months , in @entity68 over the course of a year with none of the babies having any previous exposure to @entity20			1
dr @entity50 said that children respond to ' tone ' clues in their parents ’ speech from an early age			2
interesting : researchers said that children respond to ' tone ' clues in their parents ' speech from an early age she said : ' tone of voice is a really useful signal to what someone is thinking			0
' we never have access through to other people ’s minds , except the signals in language that we give out			0
' she said that the study results meant that it was less important what parents said , but ' how they said it '			0
she said that even swearing , or anger could theoretically be ' covered up ' by disguising tone - but that it was better to use another word in its place			0
dr @entity50 said : ' it could be the child asks us if you like their drawing			0
' you might say yes , but if you do n’t sound enthusiastic , it could be that meaning does n’t get across			0
' at the stage of life before children get access to words and language , parents ’ tone is exaggerated when speaking to babies			2
' there is a group of parents that may not be as confident as other parents and feel very self - conscious			0
' if a health visitor says : “ talk to the baby ” sometimes these parents say that they do n’t know what to say			0
' but this study shows that they should n’t worry so much about what to say , but rather pay attention to the tone			0

babies reacted in the same way to their mother whether she was speaking in @entity19 or @entity20
