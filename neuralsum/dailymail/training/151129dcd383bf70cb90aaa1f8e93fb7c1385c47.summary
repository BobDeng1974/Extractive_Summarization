by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 slammed in what looked to be a strike derived of frustration as his goal put a stop to @entity9 's pre-season blip as they beat @entity12 @entity11			1
@entity13 's side - watched by @entity15 , who was there but not in the squad for the penultimate friendly ahead of the @entity18 campaign - looked at ease throughout			1
in truth , @entity9 will face a much sterner test when they host @entity23 at the weekend , while @entity2 is hoping for redemption after a nightmare two years			2

subs : given @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76			0
goal : @entity2 28 the former @entity79 man put the visitors in front after indifferent defending - @entity11 allowing a routine ball to bobble across the box and the right wing - back to lash home with minimal fuss			1
in a fixture that rather meandered along , the top flight outfit - operating in a 3 - 5 - 2 - always looked the brighter and created the better chances at the @entity90			1
@entity64 went close with an early header while @entity67 curled wide soon after			0
@entity65 nodded wide after the break when he ought to have done better while @entity69 sent two rasping drives over the top of @entity37 's bar			2
this result comes as a timely boost for the boss , who has seen @entity9 lose heavily against @entity99 and @entity100 recently			0
battle : @entity69 rides the challenge of @entity35 in the middle of midfield on tuesday night good workout : @entity69 and @entity2 ( right , who scored in the first half ) both put in impressive displays @entity109 ca n't see @entity27 working as a no.2			0

@entity13 's side kick - off @entity18 campaign against @entity113
they had lost the previous two friendly matches
