two murderous rapists will be put to death today at executions in @entity3 and @entity4			1
@entity5 , who raped and killed an 11 - month - old baby girl , will today become the first @entity3 inmate to be put to death since the botched execution of @entity9			1
@entity9 writhed on the gurney , moaning and trying to lift his head after he had been declared unconscious , prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony			1
the same three - drug method will be used on @entity5 and @entity4 death row inmate @entity16 , who shot a man in the head before raping his wife			1
despite the obvious suffering @entity9 went through , the same lethal cocktail of drugs will be used on @entity5 and @entity16			2
@entity16 , who , along with two accomplices , killed a man in 1993 with a gunshot to the back of his head and raped his wife , will be executed an hour earlier in @entity4			1
he wants his sentence to be reduced to life in prison as that is what his accomplices are serving			0
both @entity3 and @entity4 plan to start the executions with the sedative midazolam , which was used in @entity9 's botched execution			1
@entity47 has been challenged in court as ineffective in rendering a person properly unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered , creating a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering			0
attorneys for @entity3 say a failed intravenous line and a lack of training led to the problems with @entity9 's injection , not the drugs			2
@entity5 and three other death row inmates have filed a petition with the @entity62 , calling for their executions to be called off			2
@entity3 's last execution saw murderer @entity9 writhe and moan in the gurney after he was declared unconscious the same three - drug method used on @entity9 , involving sedative midazolam , will be used on @entity5 the appeal states : ' there is a well - established scientific consensus that [ midazolam ] can not maintain a deep , comalike unconsciousness			1
' @entity9 moaned and tried to lift his head , prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony @entity3 has increased the amount of midazolam to be used by five times to mirror the recipe used in 11 successful executions in @entity4			1
but the drug was used in other botched executions in @entity84 and @entity85 last year , where inmates snorted and gasped after lethal injections			0
@entity3 has ordered new medical equipment such as backup iv lines and an ultrasound machine for finding veins and has renovated the execution chamber with new audio and video equipment to help the execution team spot potential problems			0
last year @entity97 , the mother of the raped and murdered baby , told @entity99 that she did not want @entity5 to be executed			2
she said : ' i do n’t want to see him to be sentenced to death			0
' if they truly want to honor me then they will do away with the death penalty for him and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole because that ’s the only thing that ’s going to honor me			0
' i do n’t see any justice in just sentencing someone to die			0
' to me , the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you to your family , and having to live with that the rest of their life knowing they will never get to walk out those doors			0
