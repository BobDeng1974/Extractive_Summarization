' disapproving ' of the interference , it is alleged @entity28 hatched the plot to kill @entity3 as they made their way back to central @entity11 from the @entity13 surgery			1
solicitor @entity2 , 63 , known as @entity3 , died in october last year , after falling in front of a train at @entity10 , central @entity11 as they waited for a westbound @entity59 train at @entity61 underground station , @entity28 allegedly struck just after 6.35pm at the height of the evening rush hour on october 25 of last year			1
prosecutor @entity64 said : ' she had been pushed from behind into a path of an oncoming train , which was travelling along the busy platform , in front of a number of shocked onlookers			2
' the push was entirely deliberate and it was executed with the intention of killing @entity73			2
' after all it could hardly have been done with any lesser intention than to send @entity3 to her death			2
the person who did that was this defendant			2
' each was well known to the other , and had been in the company of the other for around an hour - and - a - half before that calculated push that was to end @entity73 's life			2
' the @entity18 was told that @entity3 was born a man called @entity2			2
in her professional life as an immigration and human rights solicitor , she was known by her male name			2
but in her personal life the divorcee was known as ' @entity90 ' or @entity73 and her three children , two daughters who live in @entity92 and a son who live in @entity94 , were happy with her lifestyle			0
mr @entity96 added : ' she was gender variant			0
she had no desire to become a woman through gender reassignment and all that that entails			0
' everyone including her children both accepted and embraced this			0
the evidence suggests this made her happy and her happiness being of importance to her children made them happy for her			0
' the devout @entity109 worshipped at @entity110 in @entity111 near to her home in @entity113 in @entity11 's theatreland and was on hand to help others			0
he said : ' as a person she was caring and generous with her time			1
she was tolerant of others and habitually helped others with their problems			0
the defendant was one such person			0
' he told the court @entity28 was born a man called @entity127 in @entity128 and came to the @entity129 in 2000			0
by 2010 he was ' going through the process of gender reassignment ' and ' it had become his desire to pass as a woman			0
' @entity3 befriended @entity28 after they met at a bar or club but ' at first @entity3 was wary of the defendant because she suspected @entity28 , as she knew @entity12 , was having hormonal treatment			1
' from past experiences she had had , this could render the person volatile , over emotional and unbalanced			0
' because @entity28 was temporarily homeless , @entity3 allowed her to use her flat to shower but over time found her ' needy ' and was ' lapsing into psychosis			1
' on the day of her murder @entity3 sent a text to a friend that said she was waiting to see a doctor and added ' i have a transphobic friend			1
' when @entity3 later raised her concerns , the doctor saw a disapproving look on @entity28 's face			0
mr @entity96 said : ' the prosecution say the text message provides an important insight into what became the developing tension between @entity3 and @entity28 , culminating as it did in the defendant deciding quite deliberately to push @entity3 under the train at @entity61 a mere hour later			0
' it was , say the prosecution , born of anger and malice			0
' the jury heard @entity28 , who know wishes to be known by his male name @entity12 , denies murder but has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
however mr @entity96 said the plea was not acceptable to the prosecution			0
the trail expected to last two weeks continues .			0
