discarded cigarette waste may be a blight on our streets , but researchers are hoping they could someday repurpose it into something useful			0
so far , studies have looked into how cigarettes can power mobile phones , make shipping pallets and create stronger concrete			0
now a group of @entity14 scientists has come up with a method of using cigarette ash to filter dangerous arsenic from water supplies			1
a group of @entity14 scientists has come up with a method of using cigarette ash to filter dangerous arsenic from water supplies @entity22 , a well - known poison , can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods			1
but in places that lack the equipment or technical know - how required to remove it , it still laces drinking water and makes people sick			1
a team , led by @entity34 of the @entity35 in @entity36 , coated cigarette ash with aluminium oxide			1
@entity22 , a well - known poison , can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods			0
but in places that lack the equipment or technical know - how required to remove it , it still laces drinking water and makes people sick because it has a porous consistency , they suspected that the ash would be better at filtering arsenic than other materials that have been tried previously , such as banana peels			1
when they tested the material with contaminated ground water , they found it removed more than 96 per cent of the arsenic , reducing its levels to below the standard set by the @entity61			1
naturally occurring and industry - related arsenic contaminates groundwater at high levels in many countries , including @entity67 , @entity14 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
worldwide , around 5.6 trillion used - cigarettes , or 766,571 tonnes , of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year researchers from @entity74 believe they can convert cigarette filters into a material that could be used by computers , electrical vehicles and wind turbines to store energy			2
this material can be used to coat the electrodes of supercapacitors , which are components that can store extremely large amounts of electrical energy the researchers claim the material 's performance is even better that the commercially available carbon , graphene and carbon nanotubes currently used to do the same job			0
worldwide , around 5.6 trillion used - cigarettes , or 766,571 tonnes , of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year			0
that 's equivalent to the weight of 380 @entity97			0
co-author of the study professor @entity100 , from @entity101 , said : ' our study has shown that used - cigarette filters can be transformed into a high - performing carbon - based material using a simple one step process , which simultaneously offers a green solution to meeting the energy demands of society			2
the odourless , tasteless element can cause skin discolouration , stomach pain , partial paralysis and a range of other serious health problems			0
while the technology for removing arsenic from water exists , it is expensive and impractical for rural and developing regions			2
because cigarette ashes are discarded in countries around the world and can be easily collected in places where public smoking is allowed , it could be part of a low - cost solution for a serious public health issue , they claim .			0

arsenic laces water in countries including @entity67 , @entity14 and @entity69
to create a filter , scientists coated cigarette ash with aluminium oxide
when they tested the material with contaminated ground water , they found it removed more than 96 per cent of the arsenic
