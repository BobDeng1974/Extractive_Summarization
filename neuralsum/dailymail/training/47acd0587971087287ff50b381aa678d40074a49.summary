there 's a lot of talk about @entity4 ’s midfield diamond but @entity5 could have played any formation and still beaten @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity4 have not been properly tested since the @entity9 but there were positive signs			0
@entity12 had a good game and i was impressed with his range of passing			2
@entity12 ’s not a natural defensive midfielder , but @entity5 ca n’t go and buy one — at the moment @entity12 ’s the best man for that role			2
@entity21 and @entity22 also covered well			1
they are both selfless midfielders and recognised that whenever @entity12 went forward , they had to cover for him			2
@entity24 and @entity4 midfielder @entity12 takes a shot at the @entity8 goal on sunday evening @entity5 could have safely played any formation against @entity7 and @entity4 would have still won this graphic from tuesday 's @entity29 shows how @entity5 could go about ordering his @entity4 formation that all leaves whoever is playing at the tip of the diamond — @entity34 , @entity35 or @entity36 when he ’s back — freedom to roam			1
the only worry i have is that against better teams we could be outnumbered			0
at times with @entity12 , @entity22 and @entity21 rotating , they left some gaps			1
against 10 - man @entity8 that ’s not a problem but against a good side the ball can change hands quickly and all of a sudden they spring on you			0
@entity4 are still learning but the good news is that @entity5 now has so many midfield options			0
the diamond has been fine so far and it allows you to play two up front			0
it ’s in vogue but it ’s not the only way to play — just look at @entity59 and @entity60			0
@entity21 had to cover for @entity12 whenever the attacking @entity4 midfielder moved forward @entity22 also did well for @entity4 in the midfield engine room and covered @entity12 well on sunday if @entity4 stay as they are , i would keep the same midfield that started against @entity8 with @entity36 challenging for the attacking role when he returns			1
alternatively , we could get more midfield numbers by playing a three , but that changes the dynamic of the strikers — is @entity5 bold enough to leave out @entity71 , @entity72 or even his captain , @entity73 ? both systems leave some talented players on the bench but it ’s good to see @entity4 now have a real range of attacking options			0
@entity81 's @entity80 feels @entity4 's midfield looked an ideal fit and it should remain unchanged			1

@entity12 played for *90* minutes against @entity8 on sunday evening
@entity21 and @entity22 covered @entity12 well whenever the @entity24 midfielder moved forward in attack
@entity81 's @entity80 feels the midfield should remain unchanged with @entity36 back fighting for a place in the diamond
