by @entity0 convicted murderer @entity1 was headed to the @entity3 death chamber for lethal injection as appeals courts considered arguments from attorneys a federal appeals court has halted a convicted @entity3 killer 's execution so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing he 's mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty			1
@entity1 , 41 , would have been the first @entity14 inmate executed since a botched execution in @entity16 two weeks ago			1
he had two separate appeals , one claiming mental impairment and another that challenged the state 's plan to use a drug for which it will not reveal the source , as was the case with drugs used in @entity16			1
the @entity28 prevailed , ' @entity1 said from a cell just outside the death chamber in @entity31 , @entity3 , before being returned to death row at a prison about 45 miles to the east			1
the drug secrecy issue was pending before the @entity14 @entity36 when the 5th @entity37 halted his punishment about two and a half hours prior to his scheduled execution			0
@entity1 was set to die for killing a @entity41 bank teller in 1991			1
' @entity1 and his attorneys have not had a fair opportunity to develop @entity1 's claims of ineligibility for the death penalty , ' a three - judge panel of the @entity44 - based court said			1
' in light of the evidence we have been shown , we believe that @entity1 must be given such an opportunity			1
' that appeal contended @entity1 was n't mentally competent for execution because he has a 69 iq			2
courts generally set a 70 iq as the minimum threshold			0
in 2002 , the @entity36 ruled mentally impaired people can not be executed			0
@entity1 's attorney , @entity60 , argued @entity61 officials failed to turn over three intelligence tests from @entity1 's earlier imprisonment that bolstered his claims of mental impairment			2
the records had been requested 10 years ago by a previous attorney who was told they did n't exist and only recently surfaced , he said			0
state attorneys contended defense lawyers never asked for the records until march			0
the next @entity3 execution is scheduled for august			2
@entity74 has an execution scheduled for may 21 that now would become the first one since the botched injection in @entity16			0
unlike @entity16 , which uses a three - drug combination , @entity3 uses a single dose of pentobarbital to kill inmates @entity1 's lawyers also made an issue of the drug to be used in the execution and the source not being identified			1
like @entity16 , @entity3 wo n't say where it gets its execution drugs , saying it needs to protect the producer 's identity to prevent threats by death penalty opponents			2
unlike @entity16 , which used a three - drug combination in the april 29 botched execution of @entity104 , @entity3 uses a single dose of the sedative pentobarbital to kill inmates			2
during @entity104 's lethal injection , the inmate 's vein collapsed , prompting @entity16 prison officials to halt the procedure			0
@entity104 later died of a heart attack			0
@entity16 has put executions on hold while an investigation is ongoing , but authorities there have suggested the trouble started with @entity104 's vein rather than the drugs			0
@entity1 's attorneys were among several arguing the incident demands greater execution drug transparency			2
@entity104 writhed and grimaced after the lethal injection was administered , and corrections officials did not realize not all the drug had entered his body for 21 minutes			0
@entity1 's attorneys say @entity104 's failed execution proves what many inmates have argued since states turned to made - to - order drugs : that the drugs put the inmates at risk of being subjected to inhumane pain and suffering			2
@entity3 ' attorneys said @entity1 's claims were speculative and fall ' far short ' of demonstrating a significant risk of severe pain			1
' the @entity142 does not require the elimination of all risk of pain , ' argued @entity146 , an assistant @entity3 attorney general			0
@entity1 's execution would have been the eighth this year for @entity3 , which kills more inmates than any other state , and the fourth in recent weeks to use the compounded pentobarbital			1
@entity3 invoked confidentiality in late march when it obtained a new supply of pentobarbital to replace a stock that had reached its expiration date			0
the @entity158 late on monday rejected an appeal on the drug secrecy issue , saying mere speculation was n't enough to prove the claim @entity1 could be subjected to unconstitutionally cruel pain if executed with drugs from @entity3 ' unidentified provider			1
@entity1 was convicted of capital murder for the 1991 slaying of @entity41 bank teller @entity168 , who was abducted while putting gas into her car , robbed , raped and shot			1
@entity172 , 20 , had been making wedding plans and was buried wearing her recently purchased wedding dress			0

@entity180 , 41 , has had two separate appeals
' i am happy . the @entity28 prevailed , ' @entity1 said from his cell
the @entity3 was convicted of capital murder for the 1991
