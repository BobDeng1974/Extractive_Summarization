by @entity0 a powerful new model to detect life on planets outside of our solar system has been developed by researchers a powerful new model to detect life on planets outside our solar system has been developed by @entity15 - @entity14 researchers			1
the new model focuses on methane , the simplest organic molecule on @entity17 , widely acknowledged to be a sign of potential life			1
at least 90 per cent of the methane in @entity17 's atmosphere is created by living organisms			1
as a result , many researchers regard methane on other planets as a possible indicator of life			2
researchers from @entity31 and the @entity32 in @entity33 have now developed a new spectrum for ' hot ' methane which can be used to detect the molecule at temperatures above that of @entity17			2
they estimate that they can now detect methane at temperatures of up to 1,500k/1220 ° c - something which was not possible before			1
to find out what remote planets orbiting other stars are made of , astronomers analyse the way in which their atmospheres absorb starlight of different colours and compare it to a model , or ' spectrum ' , to identify different molecules			2
professor @entity53 , co-author of the study said : ‘ current models of methane are incomplete , leading to a severe underestimation of methane levels on planets			2
' we anticipate our new model will have a big impact on the future study of planets and " cool " stars external to our solar system , potentially helping scientists identify signs of extraterrestrial life			0
’ the study , published today in @entity71 , describes how the researchers used some of the @entity15 's most advanced supercomputers , provided by the @entity75 utilising @entity77 project , to calculate nearly 10 billion spectroscopic lines			0
each line has a distinct colour at which methane can absorb light , meaning it can give much more accurate information about methane at a broader range of temperatures			0
methane ( molecules pictured ) is an organic molecule present in gaseous form in the @entity17 's atmosphere			1
it widely acknowledged as being a sign of potential life , as on @entity17 it is produced as a byproduct of many living organisms methane ( @entity99 ) is an organic molecule present in gaseous form in the @entity17 's atmosphere			1
it widely acknowledged as being a sign of potential life , as on @entity17 it is produced as a byproduct of many living organisms			1
at least 90 per cent of the methane in @entity17 's atmosphere is created by living organisms			1
however , the presence of methane itself does n't necessarily indicate alien life			0
if a planet 's air does contain methane , it could come from living organisms , extinct organisms , or geological processes within the planet itself			1
another possibility is that it could have been carried to the planet from elsewhere in space			0
the new list of lines is 2,000 times bigger than any previous study , which means it can give more accurate information across a broader range of temperatures than was previously possible			0
lead author of the study , dr @entity130 , added : ‘ the comprehensive spectrum we have created has only been possible with the astonishing power of modern supercomputers which are needed for the billions of lines required for the modelling			0
' we limited the temperature threshold to @entity138 to fit the capacity available , so more research could be done to expand the model to higher temperatures still			0
' our calculations required about 3 million @entity144 ( central processing unit ) hours alone ; processing power only accessible to us through the @entity148 project			0
‘ we are thrilled to have used this technology to significantly advance beyond previous models available for researchers studying potential life on astronomical objects , and we are eager to see what our new spectrum helps them discover			2
the new model has been tested and verified by successfully reproducing in detail the way in which the methane in failed stars , called brown dwarfs , absorbs light .			0

90 *%* of the methane in @entity17 's atmosphere is created by living organisms
as a result , methane on other planets is regarded as an indicator of life
methane is detected by the way a planet 's atmosphere absorbs starlight
previous models of methane were incomplete , making method *inaccurate*
new model can detect methane at temperatures of up to 1,500k/1220 ° c
this could *increase* chances of finding methane on another planet
