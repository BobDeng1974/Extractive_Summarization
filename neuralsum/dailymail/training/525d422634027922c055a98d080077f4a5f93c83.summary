by @entity0 a simple @entity2 thread lamenting the loss of a @entity5 bagel store turned into an amazing and unusual heartfelt apology from one 50 - something man to another after he recognized the name of someone he had stolen from more than 30 years ago			1
@entity12 was reading a thread about the closure of @entity15 on @entity5 's @entity16 when he recognized a name that brought memories flooding back from years before and an incident that he had never fully been able to forget			1
that name was @entity21 , who @entity12 recalled accosting on the steps of @entity23 sometime in the late 1970s and mugging for his bus pass			1
@entity12 , right , was reading a @entity2 thread about the closure of a @entity5 bagel store when he recognized @entity21 's name , left , as the person he had robbed of his bus pass back in the late 1970s ‘ for some reason there were undercover police right there & i was arrested on the spot			1
my @entity38 had to leave work & come & get me ( i was minor at the time ) & was not to ( sic ) happy with me to say the least ! , ’ wrote @entity12			2
as well as confessing to his distant misdemeanor , @entity12 also admitted that his brush with criminal activity had had a lasting impact on his life			2
‘ i have never forgotten the incident or your name ( it has sort of haunted me a bit throughout my life ) & then here i am on fb			0
reading about my favorite bagel store in the world closing down …			0
my brain was blown ! , ’ he wrote			0
‘ finally i can say ~ i " m very sorry that you had to go through that crap that day long ago , i wish it had never happened but it did			0
the apology came about after both men were reading a @entity2 thread about the closure of @entity15 on @entity5 's @entity16 ' like i said i was trying to look tough to impress some guy who did n't believe i was in a gang , pretty frickin ' stupid huh ? so once again i 'm truly sorry for taking your bus pass back then - forgive me & thanks for reading this " strange " & very long message ! peace & love to you my brother ... ! ! ! ’ while the post enabled @entity12 to get his guilt off his chest , it was not a foregone conclusion that @entity80 would react or even remember the incident			1
@entity12 had to sweat it out for almost ten hours before @entity21 replied to confirm that he too remembered their meeting so many years before			1
‘ @entity85 , clearly your a " bigger man " today			0
memory is a funny thing , i recognize your name now , as well			0
so , apology accepted , ’ he wrote			2
@entity21 was not only willing to accept @entity12 ’s apology , but he went on to describe the man who had bullied him as a hero for being man enough to say he was sorry so publicly so many years later			1
@entity12 had to sweat it out for almost ten hours before @entity21 replied to confirm that he too remembered their meeting so many years before way back when : @entity21 , left , told @entity12 , right , that he has forgiven him for stealing his bus pass and that he was a ' hero ' for admitting what he had done so publicly so many years later ‘ interestingly , i have dedicated a large portion of my life to helping other men be the man they have always wanted to be , and moments like this one continue to fuel my faith that the battle may be uphill but so rewarding , ’ wrote @entity21			1
‘ any man who draws aline for himself , " today i step forward for myself , my family , and humanity " is a hero to me			0
so let us now , jointly , put this in its proper place , behind us			0
’ suddenly a @entity2 thread about a closed bagel store had been transformed into a special moment which seemed to have finally brought closure for @entity12 on an event which he had admitted had had a lasting impact on his life			1
other posters , touched by what they were reading , could n’t resist and also had to comment on what they were reading			0
i 've been waiting for messages like that , but they never come			0
good for both of you ! , ’ wrote @entity128			0
while @entity135 commented ‘ @entity85 , this thread made my day			2
’ scene of the crime : @entity12 has admitted and apologized to stealing @entity21 's bus pass on the steps of @entity23 sometime in the late 1970s a clearly emotional @entity12 , who now lives in @entity141 , @entity142 , could n’t leave it there and once again addressed @entity21 with an open message to thank him for his graciousness			1
‘ @entity21 , thank you for your words & forgiveness ... i 'm also glad that this thread brought some joy to those who read it , i know i finally feel peace on this subject & dare i say even joy ! ' the original bagel - related thread was started last week by @entity158			2
@entity21 was one of the first to comment , recalling how he used to enjoy salt bagels from the store after he had been out drinking			0
' 2am , 2 salt bagels and a night cap at the @entity164 , ' he recalled			0
in @entity12 ’s original message to @entity80 he too admitted that he ‘ used to go to ( the bagel store ) all the time , & get 1 onion & 1 salt bagel & eat it at the @entity169 back in the day			2
’ who knows perhaps @entity12 and @entity21 may have unwittingly passed each other in the bagel store or at the @entity169 @entity164 over the years , but it took until a @entity2 thread in 2013 for them to come to peace over the incident from some many years ago			1
‘ i know i finally feel peace on this subject & dare i say even joy ! ’ : the full transcript of @entity12 very public apology to @entity21			1

in the late 70s @entity12 got in *trouble* with the police after he accosted @entity21 on the steps of @entity23
some *34* years later @entity12 was reading a @entity2 thread when he came across the name of the man that he had always *regretted* bullying
in a touching @entity2 thread @entity12 *spilled* his heart out , admitted the incident still ' haunted him ' and that he was very sorry for his actions
@entity21 wrote back saying he accepted the apology and that @entity12 was a ' hero ' for being man enough to admit his *mistake* more than 30 years later
@entity12 then thanked @entity21 for his graciousness and that he felt ' joy ' now that he had closure on the matter
other posters also *chimed* in to comment on how the *feelgood* thread had ' made their day '
