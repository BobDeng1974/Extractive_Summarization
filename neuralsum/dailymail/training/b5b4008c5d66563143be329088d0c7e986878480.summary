when @entity0 placed a heartrending little note in her local paper asking for people to turn up at her funeral when she died , little did she know how it would change her life			1
the 90 - year - old , who tragically lost all of her 17 children shortly after they were born or while they were still young , has finally been gifted the family she always craved after dozens of people decided they did n't want to wait for her funeral to show they cared			2
used to spending the @entity15 festival alone , all of a sudden @entity0 's home in the village of @entity19 on the outskirts of @entity21 in southern @entity24 's @entity23 province , was overrun with well - wishers touched by her lonely plea			1
over the moon : @entity29 ( right ) with one of dozens of people who have come to share @entity15 with her a meal to savour : the 90 - year - old is having food made for her for @entity15 for the first time in 40 years allow me : dozens of well - wishers have arrived at @entity0 's home in @entity19 on the outskirts of @entity21 a friendly face : the village in @entity24 's @entity23 province has been overrun with strangers touched by @entity0 's plea all smiles : @entity0 has already enjoyed one feast ( right ) before the actual day of @entity50 this thursday she was so overcome at the attention after years of isolation that , with the day itself fast approaching on february 19 , she burst into tears and declared it already the best @entity15 's festival she has ever had			1
@entity0 said : ' i married when i was young , just 17 , but i lost my first two children and then my husband abandoned me saying i was unlucky			2
' then i remarried but the next nine children which i had almost every year died at birth or not so long after			0
' my second husband died when i was 33			0
but i married a third time and we had six children together , though i stopped hoping after that about having a family			0
' my child who lived the longest was aged three when he died , it broke my heart			0
i lost all the children and then my third husband died			0
' desperate and alone , she adopted a girl at the age of two , but when the girl was 19 years old she tracked down her original parents , a wealthy couple from the @entity50 capital @entity81 , and left @entity0 never to return			1
for the last 40 years since then she has lived on her own with no immediate family or friends but when her sad story was published in the run up to @entity50 , when families traditionally get together , she was inundated with offers of people who wanted to visit her			2
it means that her home has been decorated for @entity15 for the first time , people have started turning up bearing gifts for a @entity15 's feast , and there has been music and laughter from her new - found family			1
struggling to get by : @entity0 had a hard life on her own but now has a family after the community embraced her shut away : @entity0 has been lonely since her adopted daughter left aged 19 after tracking down her original parents , a wealthy couple from the @entity50 capital @entity81 , and going back to them instead here to help : volunteers touched by @entity0 's plight have rushed to her village to start the @entity15 party one young man , @entity110 , 25 , has put up a tent in her loft and promised to spend the entire @entity15 with her			1
another visitor , @entity113 , 29 , said : ' i lost both my parents in a car accident so when i heard about this woman i was very happy to visit her and give her what she never had			2
' she really is a wonderful and remarkable woman			1
' and @entity119 , 30 , who also visited , said : ' i live near my family and i will be spending @entity15 with them , but i wanted to take one day to visit this woman and give her a little something as well to also honour my own family			0
' @entity0 is not somebody who complains and she gets by on a pension of just £ 100 - a - month and some help from her neighbours , who bring her food and help her occasionally around the house			0
she said : ' i managed to save up enough money for a coffin and gravestone , and i only spoke to the paper because i wondered if they might be able to help me to find somebody to mourn at my grave			0
' i was n't expecting anyone to care or to turn up like this			0
' here to stay : @entity110 , 25 , has put up a tent in @entity0 's loft and will stay for the whole @entity15 with her no trouble : volunteers decorate in preparation for the festivities , for which @entity0 now has plenty of company scraping by : @entity0 is not somebody who complains and she manages to live on a pension of just £ 100 - a - month tragic : @entity0 incredibly lost all of her 17 children shortly after they were born or while they were still young in the styx : @entity0 lives on her own in the village , but now has company thanks to her local paper			1
