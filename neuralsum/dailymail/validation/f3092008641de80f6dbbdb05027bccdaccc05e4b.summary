a woman who ate live frogs as a child had to have an 8cm - long parasite removed from her brain			1
@entity5 , 29 , had been complaining of headaches for six years when she keeled over at work			1
she was rushed into hospital in @entity9 in south - western @entity11 's @entity10			0
there , doctors discovered something growing inside her brain			2
@entity5 then took medications to try and control the increasing number of headaches and seizures she was experiencing - before collapsing again			1
her boyfriend @entity27 , 30 , said : ' i was getting increasingly worried about her as her fits and seizures were getting worse - and so too were her headaches			2
' so when she collapsed again that was the last straw			0
' @entity5 was admitted to hospital and this time surgeons agreed to operate - despite the risk			1
during surgery , they removed the thin , 10cm - long white parasite			2
a hospital spokesman said : ' the woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called @entity41 which had been growing inside her for years			1

' @entity41 can be contracted by drinking contaminated water , or eating a carrier of the infection such as a frog or a snake			0
danger : during surgery , doctors removed the thin , 8cm - long white parasite ( pictured )			2
a hospital spokesman said : ' the woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called sparaganosis ' harm : the parasite ( pictured ) was attacking @entity5 's nervous system , triggering seizures and headaches it can also be transmitted through coming into contact with an open wound from the host			1
it most commonly affects the brain or the eye			0
upon waking and being told about her condition , the patient immediately realised what had happened			0
' she said that when she was a child , around five - years - old , she used to catch and eat live frogs with her grandmother , which must be how she contracted the parasitic infection , ' the spokeswoman said			1
' she said she could remember the feeling of the frog ' jumping ' as it went down her throat			0
she added : ' the damage to her nervous system is quite extensive but we hope we can prevent it from being permanent as the brain has an amazing capacity to heal itself			0
