@entity4 met with @entity3 ’s @entity18 coach for just over an hour and then addressed the squad asking them to get back to the kind of form they were showing before @entity23 when they out - performed everyone in the group stages of the @entity27 and established a healthy lead in the league which has now been trimmed to just one point by a resurgent @entity31			1
