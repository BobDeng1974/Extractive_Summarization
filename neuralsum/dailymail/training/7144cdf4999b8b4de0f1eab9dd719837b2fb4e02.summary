emails from reporter @entity1 to friend expressing concerns about management interference ' blocked by @entity5 from appearing in show ' by @entity7 published : 02:41 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 03:08 est , 23 october 2012 calls : @entity9 , @entity10 's shadow culture secretary , called for an independent inquiry into the @entity13 's handling of the allegations @entity13 boss @entity15 will be quizzed about the handling of the @entity18 sex abuse scandal by @entity19 today as calls were made for an independent inquiry into the @entity23 's actions			1
@entity9 , @entity10 's shadow culture secretary , called on the government to set up an independent inquiry into the @entity13 's handling of the allegations surrounding the late @entity27 it comes after excerpts from last night 's @entity5 highlighted the different explanations given by @entity13 bosses about a @entity33 documentary , which planned to expose @entity35 's crimes , and reasons why it was dropped			1
mr @entity15 faces the @entity39 select committee a day after @entity33 editor @entity40 stepped aside after the @entity13 said his explanation of why the show dropped its investigation was ' inaccurate or incomplete '			1
in a statement last night ms @entity9 said : ' with every day , new information comes to light of the pervasive and appalling nature of @entity18 's sexual assaults			1
' tonight 's @entity5 programme means that the @entity13 will have to answer more questions about who knew what and when ; and why the @entity35 tribute programmes were aired while the @entity33 investigation was axed			1
' this will be a very distressing time for the many victims of @entity18 and they will understandably want an independent inquiry which gets to the truth about what happened - not just at the @entity13 but at the other places where he committed these terrible crimes			1
' it is not good enough for the government to leave the @entity13 - and other institutions - to investigate themselves in such a serious scandal			0
' all this underlines the need for the government to establish an overarching inquiry and for it to be truly independent			0
' this morning 's select committee is expected to quiz director - general mr @entity15 , who took up his post last month , about the two reviews into the case set up by the @entity13 , the corporations vetting procedures at the time it employed the late dj and its existing policies on sexual harassment			2
questions : @entity13 director - general @entity15 leaves his home in south @entity84 this morning ahead of being questioned by @entity19 , and right , @entity40 , editor of @entity33 who stood aside from his role yesterday mr @entity40 has handed over control of the flagship current affairs show while the inquiry headed by @entity90 , the former head of @entity91 , into how the @entity13 handled the scandal is carried out			1
earlier this month , he defended his decision to axe the report in a @entity13 blog but yesterday the corporation issued a correction			0
he originally said there was no evidence staff at the @entity100 approved school in @entity102 , which @entity18 regularly visited , could have known about allegations @entity18 abused children , but the @entity13 said : ' in fact some allegations were made ( mostly in general terms ) that some of the @entity100 staff knew or may have known about the abuse			2
' mr @entity40 also said the women who spoke to @entity33 journalists had already spoken to police , but the @entity13 now says that is untrue and @entity33 actually uncovered new evidence about @entity18 's alleged crimes			1
when @entity13 director - general @entity15 appears before the @entity118 today there are key questions that must be asked if the truth is to emerge about why the @entity33 investigation into @entity18 was dropped			1
the corrected blogpost also said that while no allegations were made @entity13 staff ' were aware ' of @entity18 's behaviour , @entity33 did hear allegations of ' abusive conduct on @entity13 premises '			1
a @entity13 spokesman said : ' on the basis of material now available , it is apparent from information supplied by the @entity33 editor and programme team that the explanation by the editor in his blog of his decision to drop the programme 's investigation is inaccurate or incomplete in some respects			1
' after @entity33 shelved the programme @entity15 wrote to all staff saying the investigation was into ' @entity148 's inquiry into @entity18 towards the end of 2011 '			1
but producer @entity150 immediately emailed mr @entity15 countering that , writing : ' @entity153 - the investigation was into whether @entity18 was a paedophile - i know because it was my investigation			0
' we did n't know that @entity148 had investigated @entity18 - no - one did - that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his victims			0
' mr @entity15 will also face questions about a reported conversation he had with @entity13 director of news @entity161 who told him - in his then role of director of vision - about the @entity33 investigation and its possible impact on planned tributes to @entity18 during an awards lunch on december 2			2
she told him if the @entity33 investigation went ahead , he might have to change the @entity173 schedules			0
last night 's @entity5 heard from mr @entity150 and reporter @entity1 who both claim they interviewed at least four alleged victims of @entity176 - and confirmed with @entity148 they had investigated sex abuse complaints against the @entity178 'll fix it star in 2007			1
they say when they told bosses the @entity181 ( @entity181 ) did not charge @entity18 because of insufficient evidence , they were told to end the investigation - and the show was withdrawn			0
abuse : after @entity33 shelved the programme @entity15 wrote to all staff saying the investigation was into ' @entity148 's inquiry into @entity18 towards the end of 2011 ' - and not the allegations of paedophilia last night it emerged that @entity148 had found evidence of ' three further potential offences ' by @entity176 as a result of its investigation			1
@entity197 's @entity198 was a programme that left open more questions than it answered			0
' we still were n’t given a convincing explanation as to why @entity40 decided to pull the @entity33 investigation at all – and , in particular , to pull it completely , instead of allowing it to gather more evidence			0
' @entity207 's @entity206 : ' the noble reason for this acute and sometimes embarrassing navel - gazing is the need to protect the @entity13 's impartiality and integrity '			1
@entity213 ‏ @ piersmorgan : ' this # @entity5 expose of @entity35 is absolutely horrifying			0
which makes it all the more scandalous that @entity33 covered it up			0
' @entity218 ‏ @ @entity219 : ' i am watching # @entity5 about # @entity221 , i am speechless , shocked and revolted by the cover - up			0
we must expose other celebrities ... @entity225 ‏ @ @entity226 : ' what a shame @entity40 chose not to talk to @entity5			0
# @entity13 # @entity5 @entity10 mp @entity228 ‏ @ tom_watson : ' ca n't believe # @entity5			1
if i was the @entity13 's impressive @entity1 or @entity150 i would be furious			1
what do you think ? ' but a @entity181 spokeswoman said charges were not brought because in each case ' the evidence showed that none of the alleged victims would support a prosecution '			0
the horror stories about @entity18 emerged only after @entity240 broadcast a documentary at the start of this month - sparking mayhem at the @entity13 over losing its scoop and leading to the allegations of a cover - up			2
a @entity5 statement said : ' @entity40 has always maintained the story was pulled for ' editorial reasons ' and not because of a potentially embarrassing clash with planned @entity13 tributes to @entity35 over @entity173			2
' @entity5 has found no evidence to contradict that view			0
' mr @entity150 and ms @entity1 told programme - makers bosses wanted them to stand up a suggestion @entity18 was not prosecuted because the @entity181 thought he was too old and frail			2
when it emerged that was not true and he was not prosecuted because of insufficient evidence , the pair were told to abandon the investigation rather than get more proof , @entity5 reports			0
ms @entity1 said : ' ever since the decision was taken to shelve our story , i 've not been happy with public statements made by the @entity13			2
' i think they 're very misleading about the nature of the investigation we were doing			0
' ms @entity1 said mr @entity40 went cold on the story and she was left with the clear impression her editor was feeling under pressure , writing to a friend : ' @entity275 ( @entity40 ) says if the bosses are n't happy ... ( he ) ca n't go to the wall on this one			2
' controversial : last night 's edition of @entity5 highlighted the different explanations given by @entity13 bosses about a @entity33 documentary , which planned to expose @entity35 's crimes , and reasons why it was dropped reporter : @entity1 , a @entity33 reporter , said in the programme last night that she has ' not been happy with public statements made by the @entity13 ' since they decided to shelve their @entity18 story ms @entity1 told @entity5 : ' i was very unhappy the story did n't run because i felt we 'd spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard and they were n't heard and i thought that was a failing ... i felt very much that i 'd let them down			1
' mr @entity150 emailed mr @entity40 five days later to warn him about what would happen if the investigation was dropped			0
' i was sure the story would come out one way or another and that , if it did , the @entity13 would be accused of a cover - up , ' mr @entity150 tells @entity5			2
' in fact , i wrote an email to @entity40 saying ' the story is strong enough ' and the danger of not running it is ' substantial damage to @entity13 reputation '			0
' traumatic : @entity307 , one of @entity18 's victims of child abuse , gave an interview to @entity33 11 months ago while she was suffering from cancer			2
she spoke out in last night 's @entity5 over the scandal footage of @entity35 surrounded by girls was aired on last night 's show entitled what the @entity13 knew more footage of @entity35 on one of his many shows lifting up the skirt of one female member of the audience according to @entity197 three emails sent by ms @entity1 expressing concerns about management interference to an unnamed friend were blocked by @entity5 's lawyers from appearing in last night 's programme			1
the newspaper claimed that publication was prevented because of the potential for legal action			0
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' it is ridiculous to suggest in the circumstances that @entity5 is not prepared to take @entity13 management to task			1

@entity9 , @entity10 's shadow culture secretary , calls for an independent inquiry into the @entity13 's handling of the abuse claims
follows last night 's @entity5 which highlighted different explanations given by @entity13 bosses about why the @entity33 documentary was canned
