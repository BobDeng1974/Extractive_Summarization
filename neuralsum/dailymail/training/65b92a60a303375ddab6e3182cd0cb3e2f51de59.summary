by @entity0 a @entity2 father - of - three is being interviewed by police today after it emerged he was the mystery man seen driving from the camping ground with a girl who looked like @entity6 days after she vanished in 2007			1
@entity7 , 41 , is a @entity8 - speaking @entity2 native who lives near the capital bern whose own daughter was in the family car and who , he says , was mistaken for the missing toddler by a @entity15 eyewitness			1
the potential sighting came three days after @entity17 was abducted from @entity18 in @entity19 , a few hours drive away			0
sighting : a blonde girl identical to @entity6 was supposedly seen with a @entity8 family at the @entity23 campsite on @entity25 's @entity24 ( pictured ) just three days after the @entity15 toddler went missing five years ago it emerged yesterday that @entity15 detectives investigating her disappearance have been told a @entity8 family paid extra after arriving at the campsite with one more child than expected on may 6 , 2007 , according to @entity33 but mr @entity7 , who was spotted with the blonde girl , has since insisted the youngster was not @entity17 , and was infact his own daughter			1
mr @entity7 also pledged to speak to police to clear himself of any connection to missing @entity17 following the media reports yesterday			1
missing : @entity17 was abducted from @entity18 in @entity19 , a few hours drive away from the @entity25 campsite , in may 2007 ' i am turning myself over to police , ' said mr @entity7 , a self employed businessman , ' before these media reports get me arrested			2
' he told @entity45 , @entity2 's biggest daily paper ; ' i did have a girl around about @entity49 's age in the car - she was my own daughter who also happens to have blonde coloured hair and was about the same age as @entity49 at the time			1
' @entity54 , 49 , the @entity15 woman who reported the sighting to police , said the girl ' looked groggy ' and seemingly ' alienated ' from the family she was with			1
she said the car had @entity8 plates that began with @entity61			0
but the be registration for the town and district of @entity65 in western @entity8 went out of use 38 years ago			0

mr @entity7 added ; ' i was at the camping ground with my family			2
it is really unbelievable that i am some kind of suspect because we read about @entity49 's disappearance on a notice at the campsite			0
we were shocked and we felt for the parents			0
' it is quite possible that my daughter appeared distant			2
she was tired after a very long road trip			0
the blonde girl was said to be with a @entity8 family driving a @entity91 people carrier ( pictured ) that was first manufactured in 1996 parents : @entity94 and @entity95 pose with an artist 's impression of how their daughter might look now at the age of nine ' we spent 12 days at the camping ground we journeyed further around @entity19			2
