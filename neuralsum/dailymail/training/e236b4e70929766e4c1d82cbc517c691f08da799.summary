by @entity0 published : 13:50 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 14 february 2013 his first burial was an undignified one - dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud following the @entity6 in 1485			2
but after its discovery under a @entity11 car park , the body of @entity8 will finally be laid to rest in surroundings fit for a king , as the first pictures of his potential tomb are revealed			1
computer - generated images show the 7ft ( 2.1 metre ) long , magnesian limestone tomb that the @entity19 hopes he well be buried in			1
fit for a king : the @entity19 unveiled computer - generated images of the tomb which it hopes will be the final resting place of the king optimistic @entity27 , who led the society 's eventual discovery of the last @entity32 monarch 's remains , commissioned the designs in 2010 before the remains had even been discovered			1
the designs , which have only now been released , incorporate the white rose of @entity37 and several inscriptions wrought in stone and on a metal plaque			0
it also features the @entity42 , symbolic of his devotion to the @entity46 faith and @entity8 ’s personal emblem , the white boar			0
@entity49 , where the remains are expected to be re-interred next year , have yet to make a final decision on the tomb 's appearance and its exact location			1
some were left disappointed when a decision was taken not to bury the notorious @entity58 's body at a state funeral in @entity60			2
the cathedral is to commission architects on march 12 and is expecting to receive draft designs in the summer			0
foresight : optimistic @entity27 , who led the society 's eventual discovery of the last @entity32 monarch 's remains , commissioned the designs in 2010 a spokesman for the @entity19 said : ' the tomb design was commissioned by @entity27 in september 2010 at the very beginning of the @entity74 project			1
' it is based on @entity8 's life , and what was important and meaningful to him , and the design was undertaken by a team of specialists with over 40 years of research into @entity8 ' the society is looking forward to working with the cathedral and @entity84 to honour the return of the king			2
' the designs would cost around £ 30,000 to implement , which the society hopes will met through donations			1
it said 65 per cent of the costs had already been met for the tomb , which would take four months to construct			2
the centuries - old mystery of what happened to the body of @entity8 was answered earlier this months when scientists from @entity11 university confirmed the remains were those of the king			1
their tests revealed how appallingly he was treated in death after defeat at the hands of @entity107 at the @entity6 in 1485			2
new resting place : it is expected that @entity8 's remains will now be re-interred at @entity11 cathedral the hunchback king : the skeleton , unearthed in a dig last september , showed evidence of the same curvature of the spine and battle injuries thought to have been suffered by the last @entity32 king the face of a king : there were cheers from media who had gathered from around the world as the announcement was made at the @entity128 this morning clues : @entity8 's skeleton showed signs of horrific injuries and the curved spine also matched accounts of the humpback king stripped naked with his hands tied , and scarred by multiple ‘ humiliation wounds ’ inflicted as his body was paraded through @entity11 , @entity8 was dumped in a shallow grave with no coffin or shroud			1
using historical maps , archaeologists had traced a friary where the king was rumoured to have been buried , which now lies beneath a social services department car park in @entity11			1
screenwriter miss @entity27 described the chill she felt when walking through the car park in august 2009 : ‘ it was a hot summer and i had goosebumps so badly and i was freezing cold			0
' i walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew i was walking on his grave			0
’ the cut mark on the right rib of @entity8 : it is thought this and a number of other injuries found on the skeleton are evidence of ' humiliation injuries ' inflicted after his death two vertebrae of king @entity8 , showing some abnormal features relating to the scoliosis : the find corroborates historical accounts of @entity8 which described him as a hunchback only three weeks into the dig in september 2011 , her instincts appeared to be confirmed when researchers found the skeleton of an adult male in a badly - dug grave who had a severely curved spine : @entity8 was famously nicknamed @entity179			2
the bones were subjected to ‘ rigorous academic study ’ by a team from the @entity128 , and those involved were all sworn to secrecy			0
the remains had lain almost completely undisturbed less than three feet below ground , but were almost destroyed when a 19th century outhouse was built just inches away			2
dna from the skeleton was matched with two of @entity8 ’s living descendants – @entity194 - born furniture maker @entity192 , whose mother was a direct descendant of the king ’s sister @entity197 , and a second anonymous individual			1
the curved spine of the skeleton and its numerous wounds also helped confirm the ‘ astonishing ’ discovery , even if @entity8 ’s so - called withered arm appears to be a myth			0
as they were found : the remains of @entity8 were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in @entity11 last september , in what were once the precincts of @entity213 church the skull of the king as it was found by archaeologists : trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a sword and a halberd hunched in death as he was in life : the skeleton was found in good condition with its feet missing the @entity6 : @entity8 , pictured on the white horse , was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at @entity6 , in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the @entity237 studies revealed the remains dated back to the era of the @entity241 , while the individual was found to be in his late 20s to 30s			1
@entity8 was 32 when he died			0
his skeleton was found to have suffered ten injuries at the time of death , but only two skull wounds were potentially fatal and were most likely inflicted by a sword or a halberd – a spiked axe on a pole			0
the corpse was subjected to ‘ humiliation injuries ’ – including a sword through the right buttock – likely to have been inflicted after death			0
the pronounced curvature of the spine , caused by severe scoliosis , supports the @entity260 description of the monarch as ‘ rudely stamp ’d , deformed , unfinish ’d ’			0
but the findings suggest the @entity264 used dramatic licence when describing @entity8 as having a withered arm			0
@entity8 ruled for only two years following the death of his brother , @entity268 his body was discovered at @entity213 , a @entity213 friary destroyed during @entity272 ’s @entity271			0
the search for the lost king : the announcement follows months of analysis of the remains since they were unearthed last september in a car park behind a council social services building in @entity11			1

computer - generated images reveal the £ 30,000 magnesian limestone tomb
design was commissioned by @entity19 who led search for remains
@entity49 has yet to make a decision on tomb 's final appearance
remains were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in @entity11
historical records say he was taken to the city after he was killed in 1485
dna sample matches that of a descendant of the king 's *maternal* line
