by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:29 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 16:29 est , 23 june 2013 double pay : @entity3 remained on a £ 100k - a - year salary while working outside the @entity5 a senior manager at the @entity5 is to leave the organisation next week with a six - figure redundancy cheque after taking a six - month paid sabbatical			1
@entity3 has been allowed to work for an outside organisation while still picking up her £ 100,000 - a - year salary from the quango that distributes public money to the arts			1
the sabbatical leave has meant she has qualified for a redundancy payment of at least £ 100,000 because the @entity5 is abolishing her job next month			1
miss @entity3 would not have been entitled to a redundancy payment had she resigned last autumn to take up her new role in charge of @entity21 , a largely taxpayer - funded enterprise that makes sets for the @entity24			2
the deal means miss @entity3 will have been paid close to £ 200,000 by the @entity5 since she left the organisation last autumn			1
she is understood to have been on annual leave , on full pay , between october and the beginning of this year , when the paid sabbatical period started			2
however her real job for the past eight months has been chief executive of @entity33 , which is heavily funded by public money			0
her appointment as chief executive of @entity33 was announced last autumn by @entity36 , now @entity38 director general but then chief executive of the @entity24 and chairman of @entity33			0
miss @entity3 has not been paid by @entity33 since last october			2
but one of her first actions in the new job was to join a party which made a taxpayer - funded visit to @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 ‘ to create new dialogues about social and personal transformation through the arts ’			0
miss @entity3 began working at @entity52 's @entity24 while on sabbatical leave from the @entity5 the arrangement for @entity55 drew condemnation from taxpayer pressure groups			1
@entity59 , of the @entity60 ’ @entity58 , said : ‘ this is another example of the @entity5 squandering public money			0
’ the deal is likely to prove embarrassing to mr @entity36 as well as to @entity5 chairman sir @entity65 and the minister in charge of the government department that pays for the @entity5 , culture secretary @entity69			0
miss @entity3 , who began her career as a community theatre director in @entity52 , joined the @entity5 in 1999			1
among grants it announced last year were £ 10million for the @entity24 and £ 1million for the @entity33 operation			0
the @entity5 said miss @entity3 was entitled to a sabbatical as part of a long - standing contract			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we are not able to publish an individual ’s redundancy payment until after they have been made			0
this is because until the final payment is made the calculations are subject to change			0

@entity3 began new job during sabbatical from @entity5
as a result she will still receive £ 100,000 redundancy pay
