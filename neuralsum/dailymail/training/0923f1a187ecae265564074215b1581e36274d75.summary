@entity0 , one of the @entity2 commandos who carried out the legendary ' heroes of the @entity5 ' raid , has died aged 101 one of the last two survivors of the legendary @entity8 ' heroes of the @entity5 ' raid , which helped thwart @entity10 's plans to build a @entity12 nuclear bomb , has died aged 101			1
just 31 at the time , @entity13 was the oldest member of the team who successfully destroyed the heavy water production facility at the @entity18 plant in @entity5 , southern @entity2			1
the raid , which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in @entity8 , was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross country skiing 250 miles into @entity26			2
the heavy water , or deuterium oxide , which the @entity18 plant produced was essential to the @entity31 scientists working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to destroy it			1
but it was no soft target			0
perched on an icy ravine , surrounded by machine gun - toting guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable			1
an earlier attempt to destroy it had ended in bloody failure when some of gliders carrying the team of 30 @entity46 crashed in bad weather			1
those who escaped were captured by the @entity48 , tortured and then executed			0
for the second attempt the @entity49 gambled on a small six - man squad , all @entity2 , who would parachute in			1
after intensive training using a mocked up model of the basement of the plant painstakingly recreated at the explosives base in @entity58 , @entity59 the team were ready for action			1
they were issued thick nordic - style woollen jumpers and brilliant white camouflage smocks to protect themselves from the elements			2
crack squad : some of the saboteurs back in @entity68 after the raid			0
aged 31 at the time mr @entity70 ( circled ) was the oldest member of the team the plan was for them to meet up with four members of the previous mission 's advance team who had manged to survive a harsh winter living in an abandoned cabin and eating lichens and moss scraped off rocks			1
mr @entity82 would play a vital role			0
an explosives expert , he was known for having a cool head - something that would prove invaluable if things did n't go to plan			2
and of course they did n't			0
@entity88 began in ernest on february 17 1943 and got off to a disastrous start when bad weather resulted in the team landing some 18 miles form the planned drop zone			2
they were forced to spend five days struggling through fierce snow storms before finally linking up with their compatriots			0
by february 27th the team had regrouped and was ready to launch their assault			2
the @entity18 plant was connected by a bridge stretching over the steep ravine so to avoid the @entity31 guards the commandos opted to climb down one side of the ravine , wade across the icy river @entity108 and scramble up the other side			1
they would then follow a railway track that led all the way into the plant , get inside through a door which a plantworker was supposed to leave open , set their charges and escape			0
leaving their radio operator at the top of the ravine in case anything went wrong , the rest of the party struggled for hours through thick snow to make it to the river before beginning the arduous task of climbing up the other side			0
exhausted and soaking wet they eventually scrambled to the top and broke into the grounds of the facility using a pair of bolt cutters			0
the raid was hailed as the most successful act of sabotage of @entity8 and was later made into the @entity139 film heroes of the @entity5 staring @entity140 when they arrived at the basement door which was supposed to have been left open they were devastated to find it still locked			0
they split up into two parties @entity0 and @entity147 found a window at the back of the basement and took the risk of smashing their way in			1
meanwhile the other party , led by the 23 - year - old commander @entity155 , managed to crawl through a cable duct before taking a @entity158 plant worker by suprise			1
@entity155 heard @entity0 smashing the window as he began to lay charges and when @entity0 and @entity161 entered the room they were nearly shot by their own colleagues who had mistaken them for guards			1
@entity0 then placed the remaining charges while @entity155 set the fuses			1
fearing the @entity31 could discover them at any moment they used 30 second fuses instead to the planned two minute ones			1
the team dashed outside the plant as the charges went off with a dull thud			1
mercifully the guards were not alert			0
the mission had been a stunning success and around 1000lbs of heavy water - so vital to @entity10 's dreams of world domination - was washed away			1
now there was just the small matter of escape			0
the commandos managed to make it all the down the ravine and back up the other side before the @entity31 were alerted , but now a chase was on			1
@entity0 and his comrades ploughed on into a snowstorm , using their wooden cross country skis to make the epic 250 mile journey into neutral @entity26			2
' they did n’t reckon that they would get out alive , ' mr. @entity0 ’s son , also named @entity0 , recalled			2
' they were n’t sure of that			0
they were scared in some ways , but there was no panic			0
' back in @entity68 the the @entity49 chiefs were delighted at their success - and heralded the mission as the most successful act of sabotage of the @entity8			0
@entity139 treatment : @entity140 , ( left ) , and @entity211 keep a watchful eye for @entity213 in the 1964 film the nazis were forced to relocate their heavy water project and move their remaining supplies of the essential ingredient @entity219			1
but the ferry they used to move it was subsequently sunk by a @entity158 resistance			0
in his report the mission 's commander @entity155 described @entity0 as ' beyond doubt the best member of the party '			1
for his part in the mission , @entity0 was awarded the @entity230 and the @entity232 medal , the @entity234 medal of @entity235 and the @entity236 and @entity237			2
his escapades were later given the @entity139 treatment in the 1965 film heroes of the @entity5 starring @entity140 and @entity211			0
mr @entity0 and his wife were among the many @entity2 who fled to @entity242 when the @entity213 occupied their country in 1940			1
although he had never been a soldier he became part of @entity68 's @entity49 , which had been set up to coordinate resistance in occupied @entity246			0
following the assault on @entity248 , mr. @entity0 would join mr. @entity155 on a series of other missions			2
he is survived by a son , a daughter , four grandchildren ; and three great - grandchildren			0
his wife , @entity255 , died in 1997			0
@entity155 is now the mission 's only living survivor aged 93 .			2

@entity2 @entity0 was one of the last two living survivors of operation @entity259
key member of the six - man team that blew up heavy water facility at the @entity18 *hydroelectric* plant in @entity2
the attack *effectively* ended @entity31 's chances of developing a nuclear weapon
