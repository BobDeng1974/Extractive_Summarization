a mother who spent months feeling unwell was horrified to discover she probably had cancer - after spotting all her symptoms on a @entity5 post			1
@entity6 , 36 , had experienced bloating , lower back pain and constipation over a three - month period			1
she also frequently needed to urinate			0
but having previously suffered irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis , she put the symptoms down to those conditions			1
it was only when she stumbled across a post on her @entity5 timeline , which detailed all the same symptoms , that she realised it could be cancer			1
tests later revealed she had an aggressive ovarian tumour - and the disease had begun to spread			1
she had been suffering from bloating , back pain , constipation and frequently needing the loo in october 2014 , mrs @entity6 underwent a hysterectomy to remove her womb and her ovaries			1
she is pictured with husband @entity33 , and her five - year - old son , @entity34 , before being diagnosed with cancer after performing a hysterectomy to remove her womb as well as her ovaries , surgeons revealed the cancer had already begun to spread			1
mrs @entity6 is now undergoing chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can beat the disease			1
she hopes her story will raise awareness to the symptoms of ovarian cancer , prompting other women to see their doctor if they are worried			1
warning signs of the disease can be difficult to recognise , particularly in the early stages			2
this is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity56 ) or pre-menstrual syndrome ( @entity58 )			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' the symptoms are the same , so i thought it could have been irritable bowel syndrome ' i went down the gluten free route but that did n't make any difference			1
' the idea of cancer had n't even entered my head			2
you just never dream this going to happen to you			0
' by early 2014 , she had been suffering with her symptoms for three months			2
the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise , particularly in its early stages			1
this is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity56 ) or pre-menstrual syndrome ( @entity58 )			1
however , three main symptoms are more frequent in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer			1
they are : other symptoms , such as back pain , needing to pass urine more frequently than usual , and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area			1
however , they may be present in some women with ovarian cancer			1
source : @entity97 idly scrolling @entity5 one evening , she noticed a post raising awareness of ovarian cancer			1
' a friend had shared a post from a friend of theirs about her experiences of cancer and what she 'd been through , ' said mrs @entity6			1
' there was a list of symptoms and i realised i had them all			2
' i called my doctor straight away and told her that i thought i might have cancer			2
' medics confirmed mrs @entity6 had a cyst , which was removed and sent away for a biopsy			1
she was also referred for an internal examination , which revealed abnormalities			0
in october 2014 , she was called into @entity122 hospital			0
' i thought i was just going in for check - up so i did n't think to take anyone with me , ' she said			2
' i was told i had clear cell carcinoma			0
' it all sounded very medical and i had no idea what that meant			0
finally , it dawned on me that it was a type of ovarian cancer			1
' i was on my own finding this out			0
i spent ages with the @entity136 nurse afterwards , sobbing in shock			0
' i phoned my husband @entity33 as soon as i came out of hospital and told him over the phone			0
i could n't keep it to myself , i had to tell somebody			0
' having to tell my son @entity34 was horrible			0
he knows i have ovarian cancer , but he 's only five so he does n't quite understand what cancer means			1
' two weeks later , mrs @entity6 met with surgeons , who gave her a heartbreaking choice – whether to have one ovary removed , or a complete hysterectomy , which would leave her unable to have more children			2
' i already had @entity34 , but i would have liked to have had more children , ' she said			0
' it was difficult but i decided on the full hysterectomy – i did n't want my cancer coming back			2
' afterwards doctors told me i 'd made the right choice			2
i had stage 1c cancer , meaning the cancer cells were n't contained in my ovary			2
after the hysterectomy , mrs @entity6 underwent a course of chemotherapy , with each round leaving her sick for a week afterwards			1
she also lost her hair - which she says was an emotional experience ' i 'd have needed the hysterectomy eventually anyway			1
' now , mrs @entity6 is nearing the end of her course of chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can be cured			1
her treatment has been gruelling , however , with each round leaving her feeling constantly sick for a week afterwards			0
she has also lost her hair			2
' my hair started coming out in clumps , so i decided to just get a friend to shave it , ' she said			0
' i did n't want to just watch it fall out			0
it was nice to regain a little control			0
' it was a really emotional experience			0
my mum and dad came round and everybody cried – even my friend that was shaving my head			0
mrs @entity6 has been promoting @entity192 charity , hosting a coffee morning to raise money ' my mum held my hand throughout			2
it was tough but i felt better afterwards			0
' mrs @entity6 has also been busy promoting @entity192 , hosting a coffee morning to raise money for the charity			2
she is also keen for women to be more aware of the symptoms of ovarian cancer			1
' i do n't think people are sure of symptoms			0
there 's not a definite list , they 're all a bit vague and lots of them could mean other things , ' she said			0
' i think that uncertainty puts people off going to the doctors			0
' there 's no screening for ovarian cancer like there is with the smear test for cervical			1
' women need to know the signs because early diagnosis is the best chance of survival			0
' it 's easy to dismiss and ignore symptoms , but it 's not worth the risk			0
' clear cell carcinoma is normally treated with a hysterectomy operation @entity234 cell cancer of the ovary is an uncommon type of ovarian cancer			1
epithelial ovarian cancer means the cancer started in the surface layer covering the ovary			1
it accounts for 3 to 5 per cent of patients with ovarian cancer in the western world and 20 per cent in the @entity245			1
it is likely that the cause of clear cell cancer is different from the common variety			0
the prognosis for women with clear cell cancer is greatly influenced by the stage of the disease			2
@entity234 cell cancer may also arise more commonly in women with a history of endometriosis			2
the first treatment is the same as for the common form of epithelial ovarian cancer – a hysterectomy			1
in some circumstances removal of the lymph glands in the pelvis and back of the abdomen may also be included			0
as well as removing the pelvic organs ( ovaries , fallopian tubes , uterus and omentum – the fatty tissue that covers the abdominal organs ) , fluid will be collected from the abdominal cavity for testing for any cancer cells			0
a pathologist will examine the tissue and fluid removed to try and decide how advanced the cancer is			0
some tumours are just in the ovary and so will have a better prognosis , about 20 per cent are stage 1			0
however , in some cases , tumours will have spread through the outer lining ( capsule ) of the ovary and to other organs including the uterus ( womb ) , fallopian tubes , the lymph glands and the omentum			0
usually post-operative treatment involves chemotherapy			0
