by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:30 est , 12 august 2013 @entity3 : 09:08 est , 12 august 2013 a @entity5 website believes it has confirmation that the successor to @entity8 will be called the @entity9 , and that @entity11 ’s rumoured low - cost @entity8 will be known as the @entity12			1
the website @entity13 said that its ' sources in @entity17 ' have confirmed the names , which have long been under speculation			1
the c in the @entity12 is thought to stand for ' colour ' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours , rather than the standard black and white options			1
@entity11 is set to officially unveil the new generation iphone at an event next month , insiders say			2
the new generation @entity8 expected to be launched on september 10 will run new software @entity31 and possibly include a finger - print scanner it is believed the event , allegedly on september 10 , will see the launch of the upcoming @entity9 and possibly also a rumoured @entity12 ' low - cost ' device			1
indicated updates on the @entity9 include sensor which can identify the owner by his or her fingerprints			1
photographs have leaked of a smartphone dubbed ‘ @entity12 ’ , supposedly intended as a cheaper version of the popular @entity8 , with a plastic case			2
due to its relatively expensive price tag , @entity11 is struggling to succeed in emerging markets , something which the rumoured september event could change , according to @entity49			2
previously the company has solved this problem by offering its old models at a lower price , but cheaper @entity56 phones have seen their market share dip , the tech - website said			2
rumoured updates on the new @entity9 include an slow - motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest @entity64 implied a scanner function			1
according to @entity67 , values can range depending on a variety of factors , including device colour , physical damage and liquid damage the code describes a user touching the home button with their thumb			0
a fingerprint then appears on the screen , that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the ' recognition is complete '			0
more code discovered in @entity31 suggests phones running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 frames - per - second ( @entity88 ) rather than around 30 frames per second			0
this is fast enough to allow @entity8 users to create slow - motion films			0
the @entity31 software also lets users swipe between menus , select apps and control the device 's screen using just head movements			0
a string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of @entity11 's @entity31 software , pictured , gives the strongest indication to date that either the @entity9 or the @entity104 could have a fingerprint scanner when the @entity108 feature is enabled , it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps			1
when the required section is highlighted , users can move their head to the left to select it			0
other new features include @entity117 in @entity118 that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark			0
the new @entity64 software for @entity8 includes a radical redesign of menus and icons as well as improved notifications and better photo - organising abilities .			0

new generation @entity9 and @entity12 believed to be weeks away
