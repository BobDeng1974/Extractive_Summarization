by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 08:56 est , 28 january 2013 @entity1 is taken for a walk by wildlife sanctuary assistant manager @entity3 foxes and hounds are usually enemies , but @entity1 has lived for 13 years alongside dogs , going for ' walkies ' , playing fetch and chewing bones			1
she was rescued by staff at @entity11 and @entity12 , after being found almost strangled hanging off a bridge from rope around her neck			1
but as volunteers at the sanctuary nursed the red fox back to health , they noticed she had canine tendencies and was used to human interaction			2
when @entity24 had recovered enough to be released back into the wild , staff were worried she had become too domesticated to survive - and were forced to let her stay at the sanctuary full time			0
lucky @entity24 now enjoys a dog 's life - playing with squeaky dog toys , chasing balls , and chewing on bones in the sanctuary 's gardens			1
she enjoys a daily walk with the centre 's dogs , and walks to heel on the lead			1
she even snuggles up to staff for tummy tickles and wags her tail in appreciation			0
@entity42 , who runs the sanctuary , said : ' we found @entity24 dangling from a bridge , caught in a rope			1
she was very lethargic , and obviously very ill. ' she seemed to be used to human interaction , so we believe someone had tried to hand rear her for a time			0
' as we nursed her back to health , we realised she was far too tame to ever survive in the wild , so she made her home here			0
' we have six foxes at the sanctuary , and although @entity24 will occasionally have a sniff as she walks past them , she much prefers playing with the other dogs			2
' but she seems to love human interaction most of all			0
she 's very spoilt but she 's such a lovely girl she deserves it			0
' she 's a bit of a diva - she turns her nose up at raw meat , and will only eat cooked chicken			1
' we do get a lot of funny looks walking her around @entity11 town centre on a lead with the other dogs - people tend to do a double take			2
' she might not be your average fox , but she 'll have a home for life here , and she 's a delight to be around			0
' the @entity96 advises against hand rearing foxes unless absolutely necessary , because they become ' imprinted ' and lose the ability to fend for themselves			0
@entity24 has been described as a ' diva ' because she sleeps in a dog basket and will only eat cooked chicken video shows @entity24 at home in the wildlife sanctuary			1
