@entity0 will not play for @entity1 again until 2015 following the latest setback in his nightmare season			1
the @entity5 striker is set for another six weeks on the sidelines after scan results confirmed he had suffered a grade two thigh strain during training at @entity11 on monday			2
it is the same thigh @entity0 damaged whilst on @entity5 duty in september but it is a completely different injury			1
the rehabilitation programme , however , is the same and that means he will miss a huge chunk of @entity1 's stuttering campaign			2
aside from that , @entity0 will also be absent for huge clashes in the @entity45 against @entity32 at @entity46 ( december 14 ) and @entity34 at @entity47 ( december 21 ) , as well as a tricky @entity49 quarter - final away at @entity33			2
@entity1 said in a statement : ' @entity51 confirmed scans have revealed @entity0 has sustained a new thigh injury			1
the player will remain unavailable for selection but will be monitored and assessed during his recovery			0
' given @entity22 's injury history , it is unlikely he will be back inside six weeks and he has still not kicked a ball for @entity1 since signing a new contract , which is has the potential to be worth £ 150,000 per week , on october 3			1
it is a massive blow for @entity20 , who had been hoping to relaunch @entity0 's campaign at @entity25 on sunday , but his patience will now be being tested by how much the 25 - year - old has been out			2
@entity0 arrives at the side entrance of @entity1 's @entity68 on wednesday @entity0 scores for @entity1 during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity70 on the first day of the season @entity72 host @entity19 believes @entity20 ( right ) is frustrated with @entity0 's fitness issues ankle ligaments - @entity5 v @entity75 may 2013 , returned for pre-season			1
ankle ligaments - december 2013			0
thigh - during @entity5 training , september 2014			0
calf - during @entity1 training , october 2014			2
thigh - during @entity1 training , november 2014			1
after @entity1 drew 0 - 0 with @entity82 last month , @entity20 gave a glimpse of his feelings of being without @entity0 when he said : ' he wo n’t become a top @entity86 striker until he plays consistently			1
it does n’t matter about potential			0
' when @entity0 first damaged his thigh at @entity93 on september 5 , his recovery was slower than expected and he ended up back at square one when he pulled a calf muscle in training			1
@entity0 resumed full training once again at @entity11 last week but he now has to start the rehabilitation process all over again and , for @entity20 , it could not have come at a worse time			0
@entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 have failed to score in 998 minutes of @entity45 football for @entity1 and @entity20 would be entitled to feel worn out by the situation by his side 's lack of goals			0
in an attempt to find a solution , they would be prepared to offer @entity112 more money to secure @entity115 's release from a season - long in january			0
they signed the @entity118 striker for £ 10million in the summer but agreed to loan him back to @entity112 immediately			0
video we need to chip in with goals - @entity121			0

@entity0 has injured his thigh in another injury setback
the @entity1 striker could now be out for as many as 12 games
@entity0 has not played for *struggling* @entity1 since august 31
