by @entity0 discovery : a study of letters written by @entity4 reveal the theorist 's attitudes towards women changed over his lifetime he once wrote that a future wife would be an ' object to be loved and played with - better than a dog anyhow			1
' but researchers studying letters written by evolutionary theorist @entity4 have discovered that his attitudes towards women later changed			2
@entity17 , a research associate at @entity18 , found that @entity4 went out of his way to back women 's scientific work and often wrote to campaigners for women 's rights			1
dr @entity17 told @entity24 : ' @entity4 was no feminist			2
' but our research has shown that his views on gender were a lot more complex than has been acknowledged			0
' as a published scientist , @entity4 usually reflected and reinforced middle - class , @entity33 gender ideology , which saw women as domestic creatures who should look after children and the home			0
' in his letters , though , we encounter a world of private thoughts and actions , which defied those ideals			0
' early letters written by @entity4 would certainly raise eyebrows in modern day society			0
when contemplating whether to marry in 1838 , @entity4 noted that one advantage to doing so was that a wife would be an ' object to be loved & played with — better than a dog anyhow '			1
later in his famous work @entity52 , published in 1871 , the scientist attacked @entity54 's discourse in @entity55 by writing : ' woman seems to differ from man in her mental disposition , chiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfishness			0
' however , only one year later , he wrote to naturalist @entity62 treat urging her to make sure her work on butterflies was taken seriously in the science world			1
in one letter , he advised her to get the work published ' in some well known @entity68 '			0
dr @entity17 's , whose work is called the @entity70 , also told the newspaper that @entity4 's archive includes supportive letters to women who campaigned for gender equality			1
change of attitude : @entity4 's wife @entity77 , portrait above left , who he compared to a dog , and equal rights campaigner @entity77 , right , who received letters from the scientist @entity4 held correspondence with women who went beyond traditional gender roles , writing warmly to @entity77 , a traveller , writer and hunter who called for votes for women			2
she also published a novel - categorised as ' fantasy ' at the time , in which men and women lived as equals			0
another of @entity4 's exchanges is a letter to @entity101 , secretary of the @entity102			1
in the correspondence , @entity4 makes clear that he did not endorse her views			0
however , he did send her scientific papers that were discussed at the @entity106 - a forum to discuss science for women			1
dr @entity17 said that @entity4 may have kept his real views on gender quiet because he felt his work was controversial enough .			2

in 1838 , @entity4 said a future wife would be an ' object to be loved & played with — better than a dog anyhow '
however , @entity18 researcher @entity17 has found evidence that his attitudes towards women later changed
in 1872 he wrote to @entity62 treat urging her to make sure her work on butterflies was taken seriously and published in a scientific *journal*
later wrote to @entity101 , secretary of the @entity102 of @entity127 , with papers discussed at a science forum
