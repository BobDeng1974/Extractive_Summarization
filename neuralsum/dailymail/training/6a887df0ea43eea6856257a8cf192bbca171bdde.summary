' @entity22 said she was forced to take part in the fraud by conmen who threatened to publish photos of her online			1
she wept as she told how her friends and family had deserted her after the naked ' sexts ' , which she had sent to a previous lover and had already ended up on a @entity100 porn website and fake @entity102 profile			1
she said : ' it is a very , very difficult subject			0
when he told me it was going to happen for a second time it made me even more scared because it would have involved @entity14 ’s family and we would not be able to get married			0
' they would have thought very bad of me			0
for me to know he could have been taken away from me at any point because of that , it frightened me , it scared me , and to know that he could have been hurt at the same time			0
' @entity14 claimed he and his now ex-wife @entity22 were subjected to a campaign of harassment by @entity120 , who earlier admitted fraud			0
he said he did not benefit from the scam and only did as he was told because he was scared of @entity120			0
