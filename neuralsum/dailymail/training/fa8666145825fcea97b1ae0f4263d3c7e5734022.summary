by @entity0 last updated at 4:54 pm on 14th december 2011 an eight - year - old boy with an aggressive form of cancer has fallen victim to a ' postcode lottery , ' after his health authority refused to fund his place on a trial that could save his life			0
@entity10 has undergone two - and - a - half years of intensive treatment since he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma , which affects the nerve tissue			1
doctors say immunotherapy - which is offered in @entity16 - could slow down the condition and even provide a potential cure			0
battling on : @entity10 has continued to go to school in between treatments for his rare condition his consultant at the @entity23 applied for funding in june but the request was turned down by @entity10 's local @entity27 trust			2
yet his parents had met families from @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 who all had children receiving @entity27 funding for the treatment			1
his father @entity37 said today : ' it is totally unacceptable for @entity10 to be treated differently from children from other parts of the @entity41 - he should not be discriminated against simply because of where he lives			1
' this is n’t a life prolonging treatment for @entity10			1
this is potentially a cure - the difference between him making 90 or his ninth birthday			0
' refusing to be beaten , his parents set up the charity @entity48 , which has funded his ongoing treatment			2
he now spends two - and - a - had weeks in @entity16 getting treatment and the same amount of time at home			0
mr @entity10 , 40 , and his wife @entity54 , 41 , from @entity55 in @entity56 have two other children who are 10 and 12 who stay with other family members when they take @entity10 abroad			1
the whole family are now going to @entity16 this week so they can be with @entity10 while he has treatment over @entity63			1
good spirits : @entity10 undergoes an @entity65 to check on his seizure risk during treatment however , they said there were many other children who would not be able to raise the £ 68,000 needed to pay for the whole trial			1
' life is simple hard hard enough as it is when things out of your control make it harder still you just resent it , ' said mr @entity10			2
' however , i am doing it for other families who may be in the same situation as ourselves , who can not raise the money - it is simply not right			0
' he added that he still strongly disagreed by the decision made by the @entity87 to refuse to pay for @entity10 's treatment			1
' we do question the unfairness of @entity10 being treated differently from other children throughout the country - how can that possibly be justified ? ' he asked			1
mr @entity10 father said the @entity95 had decreed during an appeal for another boy with neuroblastoma that funding would be made available for overseas trials of immunotherapy if children did not qualify in @entity41			2
however , some @entity103 were not honouring this			0
the charity , @entity105 , has helped the family throughout @entity10 ’s illness			0
@entity10 , pictured here in june , is heading over to @entity16 for more treatment over @entity63 , after his parents raised the necessary funds ' it seems very unfair that children do not receive the same treatment from the @entity27 across the @entity41 , ' said the charity ’s chief executive , @entity115			1
' there really is a postcode lottery in terms of receiving this potentially life - saving treatment , which is something that the government urgently needs to address			0
' @entity123 , head of pharmaceutical commissioning at @entity125 , acknowledged that requests for the specialist treatment would only be considered under an individual funding request policy and needed to demonstrate “ exceptional ” clinical circumstances to be put forward			0
she said the decisions made by other primary care trusts to fund the treatment were ' local decisions which take into account individual circumstances			0
' ' i understand that @entity10 is currently receiving monoclonal antibody treatment and we wish him well , ' she said			1
' clearly , @entity10 ’s family are disappointed with our decision to not fund his treatment abroad - our decision takes into account the clinical evidence available , individual circumstance and an assessment of the benefits to the patient			2
' monoclonal antibody treatment is only available in clinical trial in the @entity41 - unfortunately , where patients fall outside the eligibility criteria for entry into this trial this has left the patients and their families in very difficult situations			0

@entity10 is receiving treatment after parents raise tens of *thousands* of pounds
