experts said resin used on one of the ' mini mummies ' was made in the 19th century they may look like the real thing , but at least two of the mummies in the @entity8 ' collection have been found to be fakes			1
using ct scans , x-rays and carbon dating , experts said the resin used on one of the ‘ @entity15 ’ mummified bodies was actually made during the mid- 19th century			1
while a scan of another revealed a mixture of male and female bones , as well as a ‘ modern nail			1
’ the experts , led by @entity22 , are due to present their findings at the museum on thursday			1
the @entity25 of @entity15 and the @entity26 of the @entity8 set up the @entity27 in 2007 with the aim of cataloguing , studying and restoring its collection of mummies			2
the @entity8 collection holds nine complete @entity15 mummies , and eighteen body parts made up of heads , hands and feet			2
led by ms @entity22 , the team used x-rays and electron microscopes to study chemical elements in the bandages , as well as ct scans to create 3d images of the contents inside			2
this involved carbon dating the mummies to determine their age , plus infrared and ultraviolet scans to show markings that would traditionally be hidden to the naked eye			2
the two so - called ‘ mini mummies ’ were originally believed to date back to @entity15 , and contain a child or animal			1
during the tests , the researchers discovered that the wrappings around the 23 - inch ( 60cm ) long mummies were from approximately 3,000 @entity57 , which suggested they could be real , but the bones found inside were from the @entity59			1

a ‘ modern nail ’ was also found in the contents there was a mixture of male and female bones , as well as various body parts , including an adult tibia and fibula , foot bones and a vertebrae			1
embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual in @entity15			0
the earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around @entity85 , but recent evidence suggests it may have started earlier			2
religious ceremonies accompanied the preparation of the body for the afterlife			0
priests wrapped the mummy with linen strips containing resin , placed the internal organs in the specially prepared canopic jars and blessed the entrance of the mummy ’s tomb at the funeral			0
the mummified remains remain in good condition because the process successfully removed moisture from the body to slow down the process of decay			2
the @entity108 believed the body was the house of the soul so even after death the spirit could only live on if the body was preserved forever			0
if the body decayed , so too did the soul			0
in @entity15 religion , the soul was made of the ka , which remained in the tomb , the ba , which was free to fly outside the tomb and the akh which travelled to the underworld for judgement			0
a ‘ modern nail ’ was also found among the contents			1
‘ what a disappointment to find that the mummy in question was only a tangle of bandages arranged to simulate an ancient artefact , ’ said ms @entity22			1
‘ the mummy is an important witness to this phenomenon of forgery that was able to masterfully deceive collectors and often scholars			2
‘ scientific investigations , carried out under the direction of @entity143 and his assistant @entity144 , have allowed us to reconstruct the manufacturing technique and probably the area and the period in which these forgers have operated			0
‘ scattered in a dozen museums , there are forty examples of this particular type of mummies that @entity155 have commonly referred to as ‘ mummies child ’ or animal mummies			1
’ following further tests , the cartonnage - painted plaster and linen surrounding the mummified remains - was found to contain a resin that was typically used on antiques during the mid- 19th century in @entity164			1
in particular , traces of zinc and tin were found in the paints that included pigments that would n’t have been used at the time			0
previous studies also found that a mummy in the collection identified as a female on the sarcophagus contained the remains of a male			1
there have been a number of fake mummies found in collections globally , but the reasons for the forgeries are not known			1
during the 18th and 19th century , @entity185 ’s expeditions to @entity15 caused a so - called ‘ mummy mania ’ , in @entity164 in which people became fixated on the process			1
embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years in @entity15			0
the earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around @entity85 , but recent evidence suggests it may have started 1,500 years earlier			0
traces of embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies in @entity15 cemeteries ( pictured ) this caused a rise in fake mummies being created and put on display , and in some cases , criminals would publicly ‘ unwrap ’ these forgeries to a group of tourists who would pay large sums to see it			1
the @entity8 were set up by @entity208 in the 16th century to promote knowledge of art history and culture			0
the @entity212 was established in 1837 and added archaeological finds discovered during excavations carried out from 1828 onwards in southern @entity215			0
two years later , the @entity216 was opened that houses ancient artefacts from explorations in @entity15 , together with other pieces already conserved in the @entity8 and in the @entity221			0
in the year 2000 , the @entity8 opened a new large entrance that provides visitor information and other services , and on display are many new artworks , two of which were specially created for this hall			0

the @entity8 collection holds nine complete @entity15 mummies , and eighteen body parts made up of heads , hands and feet			2
ms @entity22 told the @entity238 that ' mummies were in high demand from the @entity59 up to the @entity241 because they were burned and used as a powder in apothecary potions for various ailments			1
' she said that two pounds of ' mummy dust ' would be equivalent to $ 17,000 ( £ 11,270 ) today			0
mummified bodies were also used to create brown oil paints			1
embalming was practiced for more than 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual in @entity15			0
the earliest mummies were said to have been embalmed in around @entity85 , but recent evidence suggests it may have started earlier			0
in august last year , traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient @entity15 cemeteries			2
the formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern @entity15 by more than a millennium			0
experts identified a pine resin , an aromatic plant extract , a plant gum , a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at @entity274 , in the region of @entity276			0
this suggests the practice began around 1,500 years earlier than first thought .			0

experts claim two of the nine mummies in the collection are forgeries
@entity287 used on one of the mummified bodies dates to the mid- 19th century
while scans revealed male and female bones in the same mummy
one of these bones was a tibia that is thought to date to the @entity59
a ‘ modern nail ’ was also found among the *skeletal* remains
experts are due to present their findings at the museum on thursday
mummy forgeries have previously been used to scam people out of money
