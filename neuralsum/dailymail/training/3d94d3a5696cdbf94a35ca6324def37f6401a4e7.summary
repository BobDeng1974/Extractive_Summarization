@entity0 is banking on the @entity3 public maxing out credit cards in a £ 360billion spending spree to make his figures add up			1
by the end of the decade , official forecasts expect us to have run up almost £ 800billion in unsecured loans , overdrafts and credit cards , up from just £ 430billion today			1
the huge increase in household debt is required to fuel the economic growth which the chancellor hopes will help to balance the books by 2018			1
the @entity25 this week said it expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year , then 2.4 per cent in 2015 , 2.2 per cent in 2016 , then 2.4 per cent , 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent in subsequent years			1
getting more people into work and improving productivity will help boost tax revenues and cut borrowing , but up to £ 30billion of savings will need to be found to eradicate the deficit as planned			2
now it has emerged that part of the growth will be fuelled by a boom in personal debt over the next five years			1
if the spending fails to materialise , it means growth could come in lower			2
the @entity25 now expects an extra £ 360billion in unsecured loans by 2020 , which is £ 41billion higher than its forecast in march this year			1
it means families ’ unsecured loans will account for 55 per cent of total household incomes by 2020			1
even before the financial crash the peak was only 44 per cent			0
chancellor @entity0 is hoping a boom in mortgages and personal debt will fuel growth the @entity25 also forecasts a sharp increase in the value of secured loans , such as mortgages , by 2020 @entity55 , of the @entity57 think - tank said : ‘ the idea that households are either willing or able to take on so much new debt at such a rapid pace is questionable at best and highlights significant imbalances in the shape of the economic recovery			1
‘ the apparent reliance of economic growth in the coming years on another surge in private debt should worry economists and politicians alike , ’ he told @entity65			2
the warning came as mr @entity0 was told he will have to impose spending cuts ‘ on a colossal scale ’ to meet his targets			2
the independent @entity76 said the chancellor would have to slash welfare or put up taxes by £ 21billion just to keep cuts down to the same level as @entity3 has seen in the past five years			0
without this , £ 55billion in cuts will be needed after next may ’s election if the @entity84 win , compared with the £ 35billion made since the @entity85 came to power in 2010			0
the respected think - tank suggested cuts on this scale would mean a ‘ fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state ’			0
it urged mr @entity0 to spell out before the election what the cuts would mean for public services such as transport , policing and defence			0
@entity76 director @entity100 said : ‘ it is surely incumbent upon anyone set on taking the size of the state to its smallest in many generations to tell us what that means			0
' how will these cuts be implemented ? what will local government , the defence force , the transport system look like in this world ? ‘ one thing is for sure			0
if we move in anything like this direction , whilst continuing to protect health and pensions , the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond all recognition			0

by 2020 total unsecured household debt will hit almost £ 800billion
@entity25 *dramatically* increases forecast
@entity129 hopes rising debt will fuel spending to encourage growth
