ever wondered who can find out where you are and discover what you ’re doing by looking at your mobile data ? the answer , according to security researcher , @entity5 , is just about anyone			0
that is , anyone , who has access to a @entity11 computer , a few over-the - counter sensors and a plastic box			0
with $ 57 ( £ 37 ) mr @entity5 managed to create a device , named ‘ @entity15 ’ , which can track the movement of everyone on the street			1
with £ 37 mr @entity19 managed to create a device , that he has named @entity15 which can track the movement of everyone on the street			1
the sensors in the device look at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device , including smartphones and tablets the sensors in the device looked at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device , including smartphones and tablets			1
he then connected each of the boxes to a command and control system , and constructed a data visualisation system to monitor what the sensors picked up			2
‘ actually it ’s not hard , ’ said mr @entity5 in a @entity36 interview			0
‘ it ’s terrifyingly easy			1
’ ‘ it could be used for anything depending on how creepy you want to be , ’ he said			0
mr @entity5 found that he could pick up the websites he browsed when he connected to a public @entity43			1
mr @entity19 found that he could was able to pick up the web sites he browsed when he connected to a public @entity43			1
he got the unique identifier connected to his mobile and managed to get huge amounts of unencrypted information about where he had been he got the unique identifier connected to his mobile and managed to get huge amounts of unencrypted information about where he had been			1
when he was n’t connect to a @entity43 , his sensors were still able to track his location through @entity43 ‘ pings			1
’ a ping test is used to determine whether your device can communicate with another system over the network			1
the @entity62 boxes are small enough to be hidden under a table , or scattered around city streets without being noticed			0
by placing the sensor boxes near the places a person visits , you can spy on just about anyone			2
‘ it eliminates the idea of “ blending into a crowd ” ’ , said mr @entity69			0
most people are willing to take their mobile phone wherever they go			0
according to research by @entity76 , 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them , 24 hours a day the @entity78 is hacking people 's mobile devices so that they can turn the mic on and listen in on conversations			2
this is according to court documents and interviews with people involved , uncovered by the @entity87			0
the records show that only members of organised crime , terrorist cells , and child pornographers have sofar been subject to this sort of surveillance			0
the @entity78 is also reportedly only using these techniques when ' they have no other choice			0
' ‘ if you have a wireless device ( phone , @entity101 , etc. ) , even if you ’re not connected to a network , @entity97 will see you , track your movements , and report home			1
’ he added that no one can guard against the invasion of privacy , adding that applications leak more information than they should			2
for instance , a vpn connects to tunnelling software after connecting to a @entity43 hub , meaning that at least for a few seconds , their web traffic is known to anyone wants to find out			1
alongside this , every @entity43 that your mobile has ever connected to in the past is also stored in the device and can be shared			1
‘ these are fundamental design flaws in the way pretty much everything works , ’ he said			2

he is also a law student at the @entity127			2
he told the @entity36 that he only used the device to spy on himself due to a law called the @entity130			2
one of his fellow students , @entity132 , was sentenced to 41 months in prison for exploiting a security hole in the computer system of @entity136 , which made e-mail addresses accessible for over 100,000 @entity101 owners			0
‘ i have n’t done a full deployment of this because the @entity143 government has made a practice of prosecuting security researchers , ’ he said in the interview			0

student @entity19 said device was ' terrifyingly easy to make '
named the ' @entity97 ' , the device can keep tabs on anyone on the street
it uses the unique identifier code on tablets and mobiles to get information about a person 's location from public @entity43 connections
works even if someone is not connected to a network by using @entity43 ' pings '
