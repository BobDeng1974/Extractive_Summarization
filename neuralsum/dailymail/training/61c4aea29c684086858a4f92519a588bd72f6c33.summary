these pictures show how blind @entity3 husky dog @entity1 overcame his handicap to do what he does best - pulling tourists on 50 mile overnight sled tours across @entity9 's @entity8			1
with the help of his brother @entity11 , who acts as his eyes , @entity1 has kept his place in the eight - dog teams , although admittedly not as a front runner			1
@entity1 is one of 120 dogs at @entity17 in @entity9 , a temporary home for retired professional sled dogs and rescue dogs			1
all wear booties @entity17 houses dogs until owners are found for them			0
sadly many people consider retired sled dogs to make poor pets , although kennel owner @entity40 says this is nonsense together they make up multiple eight - dog sled teams that pull tourists across trails that can run from 20 minutes to 50 miles overnight tours			1
staff first noticed something was n't quite right with @entity1 when he started to trip over his food			2
once blindness was diagnosed the vet 's advised that rather retiring @entity1 he should be kept running and that 's exactly what he 's been doing			2
' even though he 's blind , he still knows when hook - ups are happening			0
he 's still very aware , ' @entity17 manager @entity55 told @entity56			0
' when you have a dog such as @entity1 , with such a want and a drive and a desire you try it , you hook up , you see what happens			0
' kennel owner @entity40 described a time when @entity1 's brother @entity11 plucked him out of the snow by grabbing his harness with his teeth			1
the dogs are said to love getting harnessed up and taken out			0
those that do n't make the eight - dog team on any given day will go back to their kennels and howl sled dogs howling in the snow			1
some sit on top of their kennels , others choose to wait inside until they hear the familiar jangling sound of the harnesses which means they might be in with a chance to get a run out tourists come from all over to experience being pulled along by a team of sled dogs in @entity9 @entity40 said			1
' i 've run dogs in a lot of places , all over the country , and it was the most amazing thing i 've ever seen sled dogs do			2
' now @entity1 leans into his brother when out on sled runs and uses him to get a feel of the direction and pace of the run			1
' at first , he 'd be a little bit nervous when @entity1 would lean into him			2
and then somehow - i do n't know how dogs communicate - he learned that he was utilising him to determine where the turns are and how fast they were going			0
and he would let him do that â€” he would n't get as grumbly as he did in the beginning , ' @entity106 added			0
the pair are always partnered together and usually towards the back of the eight - dog team			0
while all the other dogs look straight ahead when they run , @entity1 tilts his head to the right , to make the most of his sense of smell and hearing			2
kennel owner @entity40 ( left ) and kennel manager @entity55 ( right ) mr @entity40 got into the dog sledding business after he volunteered to take care of a team of dogs on the 1,000 mile @entity124 dog sled race ten years when the dogs ' owner dropped out			2
the same owner then said she never wanted to see a sled dog again and he found himself taking them on full time			0
he later gained experience helping a friend run sled tours from a hotel before starting his own business			0
the money he makes now from running tours is used to find loving homes for sled dogs that sadly so many owners consider unadoptable			1
' for myself and the entire crew here , we know that 's false			0
they are very adoptable , ' he said @entity55 guides a team of sled dogs , including a blind dog @entity1 and his brother @entity11 through a field below the @entity151 in the @entity152 in @entity25 , @entity9 @entity40 looking out across the @entity17 dog kennel			1
