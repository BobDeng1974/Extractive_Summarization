you might be happy popping a homemade ice cube into your drink to cool down , but celebrities and the super wealthy are now demanding premium blocks to go with their elaborate cocktails			1
‘ luxury ’ ice cubes have been designed to accompany premium drinks - and a bag of 50 will set you back a staggering $ 325.50 ( £ 194 )			1
while the price tag may be high , the company that makes them in @entity12 , @entity13 , claims they last longer and are healthier than the ordinary cubes found in a freezer			1
cool ? luxury ice cubes ( pictured ) have been designed to accompany premium drinks - and a bag of 50 cost $ 325 ( £ 194 )			2
they are perfectly clear and are individually cut form giant blocks of ice @entity26 ’s cubes provide ‘ minimum dilution and maximum cooling ’ and claim to be completely tasteless to allow consumers to ‘ maximise the beverage experience ’ at parties such as @entity32 and at the @entity33			1
but all these attributes come at a cost - with a bag of 50 ice cubes priced at $ 325 ( £ 194 )			0
while most people are happy filling up a plastic tray with tap water and stashing it in their freezer for a sunny day , the company said that such common methods could be detrimental to their health			0
‘ traditional machine - ice , generally made with local tap water , may contain upwards of 150 impurities and carcinogens , resulting in poor tasting and potentially unhealthy ice , ’ the firm claimed			2
in contrast , @entity53 – which comes in both cubes and perfect spheres – is completely clear and contains no impurities			1
@entity26 's cubes and spheres ( pictured ) provide ' minimum dilution and maximum cooling ' and claim to be completely tasteless to allow consumers to ' maximise the beverage experience ' at parties such as the @entity32 and at the @entity33 the ‘ @entity67 ’ spheres are the ‘ most mathematically efficient way to cool your drink , ’ the company continued			1
its ethos is that quality drinks deserve quality cooling			0
‘ @entity74 of minerals , additives and other pollutants that may contaminate the taste of premium spirits and drinks , @entity53 pieces are meticulously crafted to deliver the finest complement to top shelf liquors , ’ according to the company ’s website			2
the company claims that normal ice made in machines and plastic trays ( pictured ) can contain up to 150 impurities and carcinogens like fine wine , the firm recommends the ice cubes are left to breathe for a few minutes before any liquid is poured onto them , but they do not break apart like ‘ less deserving ice ’ upon contact with a warmer liquid			1
the cubes are ‘ individually carved ’ from a 300lb ( 136kg ) block of purified ice , which might go some way to justify its price tag			2
their shape measures 2.5inches ( 6cm ) across			0
the spheres can last in a drink for 20 to 30 minutes , while the ' g - cubed ' ice shapes endure for up to 40 minutes - although there is no comparison to similar sized and shaped ‘ normal ’ ice cubes available			1
giant blocks of pristine ice , from which the cubes are carved , are made by freezing water from the outside so the centre of the ice is stirred to allow gases to escape			2
when it is almost frozen , it is drained and replaced with sprayed layers to make it perfectly clear , @entity122 reported			0
the company was founded by @entity125 , a business school lecturer at the university of @entity127 who came up with the idea for his company when he was dreaming up the ' perfect ' business that is niche , high margin and scalable			0
it is calculated that a block of ice measuring 8,000 cubic inches ( 20,320 cubic cm ) costs between $ 60 ( £ 36 ) and $ 100 ( £ 60 ) and is enough to make 500 of the luxury ice cubes			0
as @entity136 sells them for $ 325 ( £ 194 ) for a bag of 50 , one $ 100 ( £ 60 ) ice block could make a staggering $ 3,250 ( £ 1,937 ) for the firm – although this has not be verified			0
and if the ice cubes do melt , they are contained in re-sealable bags with a one - way air valve to push out possibly dirty ambient air , so at least you will have a bag full of luxurious clean water .			0

a company in @entity13 makes ice cubes for celebrity events
it claims the cubes provide ‘ minimum dilution and maximum cooling ’
the blocks do not taste of anything , so do not ' ruin the taste of drinks '
they also take longer to melt and are completely clear
@entity26 said that , *unlike* homemade ice cubes , their *products* contain fewer impurities and carcinogens
ice cubes and spheres are individually cut from giant blocks of ice
