more like a play from @entity2 's 11 than the standard operating guidebook for @entity5 undercover operations , agents tricked their way inside three luxury villas at @entity8 , @entity9 , to gather evidence to bust an illegal sports betting ring			1
to get away with their incredible ruse , federal agents first turned off internet access to the villas then impersonated repair technicians to gain entry to get around a warrant , according to defense lawyers challenging the practice			1

an @entity5 agent , @entity64 , accompanied him also undercover			1
the @entity65 obtained about 30 minutes of audio and video recordings of the covert reconnaissance			0
inside the @entity9 villa , @entity60 appeared to try to fix an internet outage for several minutes while glancing around the room and asking more than once to view a laptop screen to verify that internet connectivity was still down			0
defense lawyers said in their filing that @entity64 , the @entity5 agent , was sent inside because he spoke @entity76			2
still undercover , @entity60 appeared to call @entity58 from inside the villa and asked him to ' check the frame , ' the code they had previously worked out			0
in a brief back and forth , @entity58 responded that he would ' trace the wire and make sure it 's tied down good			0
' the @entity5 employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant @entity85 attorney , @entity84 , according to lawyers for four of eight men charged in the case			1

caught out : @entity97 , second from left , and his son @entity99 , third from left , were two of the eight men arrested in july for their role in the multimillion - dollar @entity29 betting scheme trickery : the @entity5 agents obtained their secret surveillance in a manner that @entity109 ( played by @entity110 , in the @entity112 trilogy ) would have been proud of after the agents left the villa , @entity60 was recorded saying he saw the internet address of the website that defendant @entity116 was operating , adding , ' @entity99 had the odds up on his page the whole time			1
' federal authorities described @entity99 , 50 , as a high - ranking member of the @entity121 , a @entity76 organized crime group			2

none of defendants has entered a plea , but @entity89 said they all deny wrongdoing			0
@entity99 also faces charges of running an illegal sports gambling business in @entity145			0
he was arrested in the @entity76 gambling enclave on june 18 and flew to @entity9 a few days later			2
the @entity5 employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant @entity85 attorney , @entity84 , according to defense lawyers			1
they filed a 54 - page motion late tuesday night in federal court in @entity9 to dismiss evidence in the case			2
according to a conversation recorded by an investigator for the hotel , the prosecutor told @entity5 agents ' it was a consent issue , ' the lawyers said			1
over two days in early july , @entity5 agents worked with a hotel computer contractor and the state 's gaming control board to shut off the internet at different times and at one point delivered a laptop computer to try to see what was happening , according to the court filing			1
investigators eventually gained access after they turned off the internet connection to two suites , impersonated repair technicians and recorded video inside			1
authorities later used the videos to obtain a warrant to arrest the men			1
in the criminal complaint , federal agents said the videos showed evidence of an illegal online sports gambling operation being run out of the villas			1
prosecutors did not mention in the criminal complaint what caused the @entity165 outages			0
defense lawyer @entity89 said lawyers learned about the ruse only when they reviewed the video recordings and heard an official make reference to turning off the internet access			2
ongoing case : all eight men face charges of transmission of wagering information , operating an illegal gambling business , and aiding and abetting - they all deny wrongdoing ' they were trying everything they could to get inside without a warrant , ' @entity89 told the @entity65 a former federal prosecutor , @entity206 , said the ploy probably will not stand up in court			1
' police are allowed to use a certain kind of subterfuge , but what they ca n't do is create a certain kind of circumstance , ' @entity206 said			0
