seven days on from their @entity2 - ruining wobble in @entity3 , this was transmission impressively resumed by @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
the proud performance was n’t without imperfection but their way more direct , full of running approach was enough for them to surpass the points target set by @entity13 earlier in the afternoon			2
then it was all eyes on @entity16 before the result at @entity18 brought confirmation that @entity5 ’s side could party like it was 1949 all over again – the last time the country won back - to - back championships			1
the @entity4 players celebrate as they are crowned @entity25 champions after @entity16 failed to beat @entity26 by the 26 points they needed captain @entity29 holds aloft the @entity25 trophy at @entity31 after @entity4 were crowned champions for the second consecutive year the @entity33 squad celebrate their @entity25 success as fireworks are set off from within @entity31 following @entity16 's win @entity33 fans celebrate their side winning the @entity25 after watching @entity16 beat @entity26 55 - 35 at @entity18 @entity39 of @entity4 goes over to score the second try during the @entity25 match between @entity42 and @entity4 at @entity31 no one can begrudge them their triumph			1
with just four tries scored this term , this tricky away assignment had become even trickier in the hours before kick - off , as @entity13 ’ runaway win in @entity52 meant @entity4 required a 21 - point win to reclaim the top spot which they had initially lost to @entity16 last weekend with defeat at the @entity56			1
that would have considerably heightened the pressure to deliver but they were largely unfazed , throwing off the shackles and looking a side emboldened by finesse and hungry for scores			0
meddling @entity42 initially refused to go along with @entity4 ’s best intentions			1
they may have offered up a dozen turnovers and bled on the penalty count by a rate of 12 to six , but they were still combative to a degree despite getting held scoreless in a second half where @entity4 dominated territory			2
they came close , mind , rallying well during @entity74 ’ sin - binning and knocking on just metres short			0
even then they sent @entity33 hearts a flutter , believing they had scored in the corner with only minutes left only for the @entity81 review to prove @entity82 had excellently shunted the ball from @entity85 ’s hands before he grounded			0
it was superb scrambling , an appetite which epitomised @entity4 ’s attitude in comprehensively winning an entertaining battle played out on a fast track vastly superior to the state of previous pitches laid at @entity31			2
@entity4 players celebrate at the end of the match at @entity31 before later being crowned @entity25 champions @entity42 's @entity97 is tackled by @entity4 's @entity98 and @entity99 during their @entity25 rugby match at @entity31 @entity4 rectified many of the issues that had affected them last weekend , buoyancy greatly helped by a tonic start			1
referee @entity105 turned a blind eye to a scrum collapse , telling @entity98 to play the ball			0
he did , @entity109 looping with @entity110 before sending @entity111 haring through the gap , a linebreak that eventually resulted in @entity114 going over off the side of a @entity117 ruck			0
@entity109 added the conversion and a 10th minute penalty before @entity42 finally found their legs and a series of errors led to a @entity125 penalty riposte before the momentum swing was pierced by penalty - winning breakdown foraging by @entity99			2
with @entity129 , shining in his first start in four years , linking well with @entity117 , @entity4 pounced for their second try on 24 minutes after well - worked set - piece			2
@entity99 threw to the rear , @entity132 gathered and his slick transfer before landing resulted in @entity135 stepping @entity136 to score			0
@entity109 converted for a 14 - point lead , just seven short of the all important @entity13 target , but there was quickly a painful reminder that there was still much work to do to even win this game first			1
@entity39 of @entity4 goes over to score the second try during the @entity25 match between @entity42 and @entity4 at @entity31 @entity117 failed to deal with a grubber kick send his way and the spilled possession led to a three - on - one overlap numerous phases later where @entity151 could n’t prevent @entity97 nabbing the try converted by @entity125			1
it was another example of @entity4 getting exposed on their righthand side off quick ruck ball , as @entity26 and @entity13 scored this way and @entity16 nearly did so too in the final minute in @entity157			1
they now needed to better mind themselves and a scrum collapse allowed @entity109 to grab the 20 - 10 advantage they took with them to the break			1
the out - half added another five minutes after the resumption and then ushered in @entity110 under the posts on 50 minutes after another metre - eating maul had eaten away at the @entity168 defence			2
@entity109 added the extras , 20 points was now the margin and @entity4 were now level with @entity13 ’ points difference but on tries scored			1
@entity42 : 15 - @entity85 , 14 - @entity136 , 13 - @entity181 ( @entity182 ) , 12 - @entity179 ( @entity180 ) , 11 - @entity178 , 10 - @entity97 , 9 - @entity125 ( @entity183 56 ) ; 1 - @entity184 ( @entity185 29 ) , 2 - @entity186 ( @entity187 52 ) , 3 - @entity177 ( @entity74 11 ) , 4 - @entity175 ( @entity176 52 ) , 5 - @entity174 , 6 - @entity188 ( @entity189 56 ) , 7 - @entity190 , 8 - @entity191 replacements : 16 - @entity187 , 17 - @entity185 , 18 - @entity74 , 19 - @entity176 , 20 - @entity193 , 21 - @entity194 , 22 - @entity180 , 23 - @entity182 @entity4 : 15 - @entity117 , 14 - @entity111 , 13 - @entity110 , 12 - @entity151 , 11 - @entity129 , 10 - @entity109 ( @entity195 ) , 9 - @entity98 ( @entity196 79 ) ; 1 - @entity197 ( @entity198 54 ) , 2 - @entity99 ( @entity199 61 ) , 3 - @entity200 ( @entity201 45 ) , 4 - @entity132 ( @entity202 61 ) , 5 - @entity29 ( captain ) , 6 - @entity204 , 7 - @entity39 ( @entity205 72 ) , 8 - @entity82 replacements : 16 - @entity207 , 17 - @entity198 , 18 - @entity201 , 19 - @entity202 , 20 - @entity205 , 21 - @entity196 , 22 - @entity195 , 23 - @entity208 referee : @entity105 touch judges : @entity211 ( @entity26 ) & @entity212 ( @entity213 ) @entity81 : @entity214 ( @entity16 ) scorers : @entity42 – try : @entity97			1

@entity218 : @entity109 ( 4 )			0
@entity42 's @entity174 wins line out ball during the @entity25 rugby match between @entity42 and @entity4 at @entity31 in @entity221 @entity4 's @entity39 and @entity132 get away from @entity42 's @entity174 during the 2015 @entity25 match at the @entity31 @entity4 's @entity39 scores a try during the 2015 @entity25 match at @entity31 despite their growing dominance , it was n’t until the 62 minute that they managed the score that put them top of the pile			1
@entity109 inexplicably hit an upright with a close - in ruck penalty , a shocking aberration which indicated the high stakes involved			0
he then missed another , kicking wide to the right from the 10 - metre line after @entity74 was yellow carded			0
however , with uncontested scrums now required during the replacement prop ’s absence , @entity129 probed off a set - piece to offer @entity109 another glimpse of the target and he was third time lucky			0
he then signed off with cramp after the kick - and - chase that closed down @entity246 to win the lineout that engineered @entity135 ’s 72nd minute try , the back row demonstrating great agility to stretch out beyond @entity185 and ground			0
@entity85 ’s near - miss followed , as did a penalty miss from @entity195 , before all eyes switched to @entity16 .			0

@entity16 needed to beat @entity26 by 26 points to win @entity25 title after @entity4 secured battling win over @entity42
but @entity261 's side could only manage a 20 - point winning margin as @entity4 were crowned champions
@entity13 *cranked* up the pressure beforehand with a pulsating second - half display against @entity267 giving them the win
