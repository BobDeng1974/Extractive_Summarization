the chef , who this week marched to @entity75 , insisted the programme was ' meticulously researched ' in fact , the @entity53 receives no funding from fishing firms			1
in a letter to @entity28 , dr @entity7 wrote : ‘ you implied that the research i do is paid for by licence money received from the krill fishing industry , and that i am therefore unable to speak freely about my opinions of that industry			1
