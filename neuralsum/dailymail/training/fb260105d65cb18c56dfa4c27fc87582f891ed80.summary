by @entity0 the sight of @entity2 shimmying off to the promised land of @entity4 while @entity5 shuffled into @entity6 is yet another sign the sun is setting on the heyday of the @entity10			1
much like the sun - starved hordes who stream from our shores to the @entity18 each summer , the true greats of football are heading to one destination			0
and it ’s not dreary old @entity21			0
sure , the ' greatest league in the world ' will still be a draw for some			0
but it is not too much of a stretch to say @entity28 is now merely a home for @entity31 ’s cast - offs			2
@entity31 had not even had their hands on a @entity49 when the @entity28 midfielder packed his bags at @entity52 in 2003 and accepted the untold riches offered by @entity34			1
he was closely followed by @entity54 a year later			0
both were undoubted stars for the two @entity57 clubs with the biggest world - wide appeal , yet both were cashing in on wealth and opportunity abroad			0
perhaps , though , it was @entity65 ’s switch from @entity52 to the @entity66 in 2009 which was the clearest indicator that the @entity10 was no longer the go - to place for the game ’s greatest talents			1
@entity65 had undoubtedly latched on to a football nation on the up when he switched to @entity31 just a year before their first @entity71 triumph			1
top gunner : @entity37 sold @entity5 to @entity6 to help fund their move for @entity2 @entity10 : @entity74 moved to @entity75 and @entity76 to @entity77 but reasons for his move must go deeper than that			1
@entity77 were still one of the game ’s super-powers under the leadership of sir @entity85 ; there was every reason for one of the world ’s greatest players to stay at one of the planet 's premier clubs			2
@entity34 , despite their standing on the world stage , have a stark record of underachievement in the last five years , with just one league title			2
added to that , they have won only three @entity102 cups since the 1960s			0
@entity65 is not alone , there is now a talent drain to @entity31			1
despite @entity34 ’s lack of recent achievement , @entity32 , one of @entity106 ’s finest players of a generation , still saw fit to move to @entity34 from @entity110 last year			1
record breakers : @entity34 broke the world transfer record twice , first with the signing of @entity65 then @entity32 @entity114 : ronaldo highlights perfect tenth : @entity32 celebrates winning the @entity117 , @entity34 's 10th @entity117 , in his first season wanted : @entity77 were interested in @entity33 but the @entity71 winner chose @entity34 the @entity10 ’s best reply was for @entity6 to gamble @entity121			1
this summer , @entity31 gets @entity2 , we get @entity5 ; @entity77 wanted @entity33 , he went to @entity34 ; @entity31 gets @entity125 ’s @entity124 winner @entity123 , and we ca n’t top that			1
the money on offer from @entity31 ’s leading clubs is undoubtedly one of the biggest lures for players on the transfer @entity133			2
but even if the @entity10 ’s leading clubs stump up sufficient cash to tempt @entity138 , @entity65 , @entity139 , there are inescapable realities which will always give @entity141 the edge			2
madridista : @entity124 winner @entity123 is on the verge of a move to @entity31 golden balls : @entity46 moved to @entity34 after falling out with @entity77 boss sir @entity85 red - letter day : @entity54 also made the move to @entity34 , from @entity149 the attraction of climate and lifestyle should never be underestimated by @entity106 clubs attempting to land the leading players			1
but there is a harsher , more blunt reality			0
the physicality of the @entity10 , one of the reasons it stands proud , is also one of its biggest drawbacks			2
@entity75 and @entity162 may believe they can buck the trend , but money does n't buy you everything			0
when it comes to the true legends of the game , the pockets of the @entity10 ’s top clubs will never be deep enough to overcome the other obstacles			0
and @entity31 will continue to reign			0
return : @entity173 returns to the premier league after failing to make the cut at @entity37			0

@entity2 joins @entity65 and @entity32 in @entity31
@entity10 falling behind @entity4
@entity33 chose @entity34 over @entity77
@entity6 sign @entity121 and @entity5 but standard is not the same
