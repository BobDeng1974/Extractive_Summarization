the three very unlikely friends were rescued from a drug dealer 13 - years ago and have been *inseparable* ever since
the @entity226 brown bear , tiger and lion would never come into contact in the wild
the three apex predators have formed their own *special* family at @entity234 in @entity22
live in their own *special*ly *designed* enclosure and spend the whole day nuzzling up to each other for comfort
