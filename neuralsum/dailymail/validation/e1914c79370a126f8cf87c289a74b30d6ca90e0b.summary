it 's a milestone age that many women face with trepidation			2
however , approaching 50 does n't appear to be phasing @entity3			2
@entity4 has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row , she has a lead role in the new ( and unapologetically daft ) @entity9 series the @entity10 and her swimwear line is selling well in @entity12 and @entity13			1
it 's now nearly 21 years since the @entity16 actress , model and businesswoman was catapulted into the spotlight at the @entity20			1
she calls the dress ' a landmark dress in fashion history ' just being on @entity37 's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black @entity28 dress saw her steal the entire show , even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as ' @entity37 's girlfriend '			1
@entity3 tells the @entity43 that the moment was actually less about her and all about the dress : ' it was such a landmark dress in fashion history			2
like nothing to do with me			0
' the black , strappy ensemble , seemingly held together with large gold safety pins , kickstarted her previously quiet career which , two decades on , has seen her try her hand at everything from acting and modelling to owning her own organic food company and designing her own swimwear			0
her looks have very much remained flawless despite the ageing process			0
still pin thin , there 's barely a wrinkle on her , something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least @entity72 if she 's in the sun - and a great diet			1
if plenty of older female stars have spoken out about ageism against women recently , any obvious discrimination seems to have passed @entity3 by			0
she says there are ' a lot of girls who are doing advertising campaigns who are my age or more			0
it 's a very nice time as far as that 's concerned			0
' ' quite sexy ' : @entity3 's new show the @entity10 sees her play @entity90 , based on an ' obviously fictitious ' royal family living in modern - day @entity92			1
@entity94 plays her mother and was handpicked by @entity3 flawless skin ( ... and plenty of diamonds ) : @entity99 ( pictured left in a recent selfie ) says she has n't experienced ageism in @entity102 and has had her 21 - year contract with @entity4 renewed it 's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured ' for years ' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she does n't find it easy to make time for working out			1
her current schedule , she says , sees her picked up at dawn and not home until 8:30pm in the evening			0
new show @entity10 , described as ' obviously fictitious ' sees @entity3 playing the character of @entity90 @entity116 reigning over modern - day @entity117 , with @entity94 , who was handpicked by her , playing her mother			1
she says of the show : ' it 's fun , it 's a drama - it 's not a comedy but it 's lighthearted			2
' she admits that her 12 - year - old son @entity127 , born in 2002 to entrepreneur @entity128 , was privy to some of the racier scenes , having spent part of his school holidays on the set			1
father and son : @entity3 fell pregnant in 2001 by business magnate @entity128			0
although mr @entity128 denied that @entity127 , now 12 , ( right ) was his child , a dna test proved otherwise taking a sabbatical from relationships : after plenty of romances including a marriage to @entity142 , an engagement to @entity144 and a short friendship with financier @entity146 , @entity3 is enjoying a break still the one ? they 've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of @entity3 and @entity37 are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one 's child			1
@entity37 is pictured above with @entity3 's son @entity127 at a fundraising event in 2013 after a string of high - profile relationships , @entity3 seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties			1
speaking on the @entity161 show , she said : ' i am single			0
i 'm busy at the moment , family , work , i 'm working more now than i ever have been , no time for love			0
' her life is , she readily admits , still entwined with former beau @entity37 's			1
although the couple have now been apart for longer than they were together , there seems to be few signs of the friendship fading			0
the actor is godfather to her son @entity127 , born in 2002 to entrepreneur @entity128 and she has returned the favour , being godmother to one of @entity37 's daughters , @entity179			1
she told @entity161 : ' we 're best friends			0
he lives next door to me and he 's godfather to my son and i 'm godmother to one of his children			1
' we 've been apart for longer than we were together			0
we were together for 13 years and then we 've been best friends for 15			0
' when pushed by the television presenter on a possible romantic reunion , she dismissed the idea , saying : ' i do n't think that 's going to happen ... but he 's the best friend that anyone could have			2
' after a brief dalliance with @entity128 which resulted in a dna test to prove his paternity of @entity127 , she married @entity196 textile heir @entity142 in 2007 after a five - year relationship , with a ceremony in the @entity16 and a lavish six - day ceremony in @entity200 , @entity196			1
a new episode in the life of @entity3 : the star has been promoting new @entity204 show the @entity10 when the relationship crumbled five years ago , a series of headline - grabbing romances followed including an engagement to @entity209 cricketer @entity144			1
her most recent paramour was said to be hedge - fund financier and wildlife photographer @entity212			2
it seems , with son @entity127 , a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs , chickens , alpacas and piglets , that she already has more than enough affection in her life			1
' i am much more country girl than town girl			0
when i had my son , it got quite difficult in @entity92 to get any privacy and so i bought a farm in the country , in @entity231 and lived out there for a while and did full - time farming			2
' the actress has a rather clever way too of filtering out calls to her office too			2
she 's known by close family not as ' @entity3 ' or ' @entity3 ' but an undisclosed moniker			0
' no - one calls me @entity3 or @entity3			2
if someone rings the office and says anything about ' @entity3 ' , we know they 've never met me			0
