@entity0 was joined by @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 as a host of tennis stars attended the annual @entity6 in @entity7 on sunday ahead of the @entity8			1
the 20 - year - old admits change can be ' scary ' , but also believes splitting from her long - time coach was necessary to build on her brilliant performances in 2014			1
@entity0 reached the semi-finals of the @entity8 and @entity13 before making her first grand slam final at @entity15 , where she lost to @entity16			1
the pair had worked together since @entity0 was 12			1
' it was definitely a different off - season for me			1
i made a lot of changes , ' admitted @entity0 , who is currently working with @entity38 as she seeks a coach to take her to the ' next level '			1
' i kind of wanted to wait till the end of the year to do that when we have a few months off			1
i think it was better to not do it in the middle of the season			1
' @entity48 can be scary , but change can also be good			1
it 's just about adapting now , i think slowly putting the pieces in the right place			2
' @entity2 was another tennis star who dressed up for the party in @entity7 , @entity54 @entity0 reached the semi-finals in @entity7 12 months ago in just her fourth grand slam , losing to eventual winner @entity57 in straight sets			1
but while that came out of the blue , her subsequent performances at @entity13 and the @entity60 ensured that the seventh seed will be expected to reproduce that form in 2015			2
' i try to see it as just a new year , ' added @entity0 , who takes on @entity67 's @entity66 on monday evening			1
' i 'm not concerned about defending points from last year			2
to me it 's 2015			2
i start at zero and try to do as well as i can			2
@entity71 's @entity70 also posed for photographers at the event in @entity7 ' my past results do n't mean anything when i 'm going to walk out on the court tomorrow			1
i still have to fight and try to play as well as i can			2
i have great memories from last year , but it does n't really mean anything to me this year			2
' this was a great tournament for me last year			0
it kind of started a great year for me			0
i think i gained so much more experience after that as well , more big matches , more high - pressure situations			0
but it 's great to be back			0
i just have memories flooding in all the time , any court i practice on , the locker room , this press room			0
it 's great memories from last year			0
' second seed @entity2 is also in action on the opening day against @entity97 's @entity96 , with third seed @entity98 up against @entity100 's @entity99			1
@entity67 's @entity101 ( left ) and @entity16 ( right ) pose for photographers at the event @entity98 opens proceedings on @entity105 and will be followed on court by fifth seed @entity107 , who takes on @entity109			1
top seed @entity110 and @entity15 champion @entity16 must wait until tuesday to play their first round matches , with @entity16 keen to make amends for losing at the same stage 12 months ago			0
' i would like to forget about last year			0
unfortunately it 's impossible , ' @entity16 said			0
' on the other side i know i can do only better , so that 's the good thing			0
' i 'm excited to play , of course			0
it 's a grand slam			0
it 's what i love to play			0
i just will do everything that i can to be just better than last year because it was very disappointing			0
it was n't really a nice time for me			0
