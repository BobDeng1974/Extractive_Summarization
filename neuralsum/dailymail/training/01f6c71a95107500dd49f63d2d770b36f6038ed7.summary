by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 14:40 est , 28 january 2014 appeal : @entity3 arriving at the @entity4 today as he battles for compensation from @entity6 a man who has bankrupted himself by spending £ 250,000 on legal fees in a 16 - year court battle over a laptop today took his case to the @entity4 in a bid to claw back the money from banking giant @entity14			1
@entity3 , a 44 - year - old father of two , claims that @entity6 ruined his credit rating after he tried to back out of an agreement to buy a computer from @entity18 for £ 1,499			1
in an earlier hearing , a court ordered the bank to pay him more than £ 100,000 in damages , but after that decision was reversed he has launched a new appeal at the highest court in @entity26			1
mr @entity3 , an offshore construction surveyor , bought the laptop from the @entity30 branch of @entity18 in 1998 , paying a £ 50 deposit and signing a £ 1,499 credit agreement with @entity6 - now part of @entity14 - for the remainder			1
he claims he was told he could get a refund if he had a problem with the computer , but when he complained that it did not have an inbuilt modem a manager said he could not have his money back			2
although @entity18 eventually relented , @entity6 told mr @entity3 he was obliged to carry on making payments , arguing that the credit agreement was legally unrelated to the purchase of the computer			1
he was put on a credit blacklist until 2005 , which he believes prevented him from buying a new home in @entity49			1
mr @entity3 insisted all along that the credit agreement with @entity6 was dependent on the purchase of the laptop , meaning that it was void as soon as he returned the computer			1
in 2008 , @entity55 ruled that he was entitled to cancel the agreement and awarded him damages of £ 116,000 , but two years later the ruling was overturned at the court of session in @entity60			1
today mr @entity3 opened his appeal at the @entity4 in @entity62 , which is reserved for cases ' of the greatest constitutional importance '			1
speaking before the case , mr @entity3 said it was ' too late ' to give in and concede defeat in the 16 - year case			2
claim : mr @entity3 has bankrupted himself thanks to the legal bills incurred in his 16 - year court case ' it 's too late for me to throw in the towel now , and besides , i 'm a very determined chap , ' he told @entity74			2
' i 've spent so much on lawyers i 'm bankrupt already - i might as well go bankrupt for doing the right thing			2
' until you get a credit blacklisting you have no idea how much damage it can do - it has wrecked my life			2
at first i thought i would just take it like a man , but a bad credit rating affects everything			0
i ca n't do anything			0
' it 's no longer about the money for me - it 's the principle			0
why should these companies and banks be allowed to get away with treating consumers like this ? ' @entity96 , representing mr @entity3 , told the @entity4 today : ' this case is when a consumer goes into a credit or debit agreement and whether he has the right to leave that agreement			1
' we have the surprising situation from the consumer 's point of view that he paid for something he no longer has '			0
court : the case has now reached the @entity4 in @entity62 and is being heard in front of five senior judges refund : mr @entity3 bought a laptop from @entity18 in 1998 , but tried to return it the next day but @entity115 replied : ' the credit agreement is conditional of that deal and continues to exist upon sale or transaction			1
' otherwise we have a rather strange conclusion that the price of the computer is paid by way of advance to the supplier of the goods '			0
outlining @entity6 's case to the panel of five justices , @entity128 said : ' the creditor has advanced a sum of money on behalf of the consumer , £ 1,449 , to the supplier			0
' so the supplier has parted with the goods to the consumer who now owns the goods			0
' the consumer rejects the laptop in this case and he says he has rescinded the contract			0
the supplier says there is no basis for that			0
' the question must be what is the basis for the consumer rescinding the credit agreement ? ' @entity115 said that mr @entity3 's credit contract with @entity6 seemed to be dependent upon there being an ongoing sales contract with @entity18 , which had already been ' lawfully ' terminated			1
' £ 1,449 is paid by the creditor to the supplier towards the price of a laptop under the contract of sale ' , the judge said			2
it would seem to me on the face of it that there was a right to rescind '			0
he added : ' you have lawful rescission so the money , on the face of it , has to be paid back from the supplier to the creditor who paid it			0
that surely is the only and inevitable conclusion '			0
the panel reserved judgement on the case .			0

@entity3 , 44 , bought laptop in 1998 but returned it the next day because it did not have a modem
@entity14 - owned bank which gave him credit refused to cancel the agreement
@entity185 ended up on credit blacklist and was unable to move house
