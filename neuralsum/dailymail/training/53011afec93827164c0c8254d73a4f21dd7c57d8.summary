hearing : @entity0 ( right ) , who has not played for the @entity7 since week one of this season while dealing with the child abuse allegations in @entity73 , was placed on paid leave while the legal process played out running back : however , @entity0 ( pictured in 2012 ) may have his hopes up following the league 's highly - controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against @entity64 star @entity63 form of ' discipline ' : @entity0 disciplined his son using a thin branch last may , leaving severe cuts , welts and bruises on his body			1
photos of the boy 's injuries ( above ) were later released by @entity85 but @entity53 , who imposed the season - long suspension on november 18 , told the player in an open letter : ' you have shown no meaningful remorse for your conduct			2
' when indicted , you acknowledged what you did but said that you would not " eliminate whooping my kids " and defended your conduct in numerous published text messages to the child 's mother			0
' you also said that you felt " very confident with my actions because i know my intent "			0
' these comments raise the serious concern that you do not fully appreciate the seriousness of your conduct , or even worse , that you may feel free to engage in similar conduct in the future			0
' @entity0 , who said he was similarly disciplined as a child , was backed by the @entity126 , which called the punishment ' unprecedented , arbitrary , and unlawful			0
' reinstated : @entity0 may have his hopes up following the league 's highly - controversial recent decision to overturn its indefinite suspension against @entity64 star @entity63 ( pictured with his wife , @entity65 ) partying : @entity63 , who was suspended after being filmed knocking out his wife in an @entity67 elevator , won his appeal last friday , meaning he is now eligible to sign with any @entity4 team			1
he later went out partying ( pictured ) the union has argued that the player should get credit for time served on the exempt list			1
although @entity63 was reinstated by the @entity4 last week , @entity0 's case is very different			1
the former had already served an initial two - game suspension when he was suspended indefinitely by the league			2
this led an arbitrator to argue that he was a victim of double jeopardy			0
meanwhile , @entity0 's indefinite suspension is the first and only punishment he has received			0
in addition , while @entity63 faced a former federal judge with no @entity4 affiliation , @entity0 is making his case to judge @entity156 , a longtime counsel to the league , @entity151 reported			1
