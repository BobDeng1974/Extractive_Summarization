on - trend : the store , owned by sir @entity88 's @entity32 , hopes to add some sophistication to women 's wardrobes this @entity92 ( animal print tunic , £ 50 , natural animal print back cardigan , £ 60 ) but it is n't all sweets and rich foods , @entity51 also shares pictures of the healthy meals she enjoys , most recently a plate of sashimi			1

the @entity73 model , who starred on the march cover of @entity73 's @entity108 , said that she was initially disheartened after she left her @entity110 hometown			1
' we 'd send beauty companies pictures of me , and they 'd reply saying do n’t ever send us " plus - size " models , ' she explained			2
however , after landing the cover of @entity6 and @entity116 in 2011 and then a @entity118 campaign in 2012 , she said the industry is slowly becoming more accepting of models that do n't fit into the size zero ideal			1
' the industry was different back then			0
now everyone ’s nicer ; they ’ve realised it works better , ' said @entity51 , who is currently taking silversmith lessons while also djing			0
it was negative attitudes to her size that forced @entity51 to take a hiatus from modelling at 17			0
' after i quit i moved overseas for a gap year			0
when i came back , that ’s when i gave it another go , because i ’d found out about " plus - size " models , ' she said , adding that it 's a term she is n't a fan of			1
' it puts women down and it puts a label on them , ' she said			0
in a recent interview with @entity143 , the six - foot - two - inch brunette emphasised her bemusement at being considered ' plus - size ' - despite being the owner of a toned , healthy body			2
' people think plus - size models do n't exercise - we do ! ' she told the magazine			1
' but it 's about health , not forcing my body to be something it 's not meant to be			2
' foodie : the @entity73 model writes a food blog and is even preparing to launch her very own cookbook in 2015 calorie - laden treats : @entity51 has shared images of a carb - filled white roll oozing with melted cheese , an apple strudel teamed with home made vanilla ice cream , a burger and a @entity81 spanakopita filled with feta she admitted that as a teenager she tried to slim down to satisfy the demands of mainstream modeling , but said that even though she was starving herself , achieving size zero proved impossible			1
' even at my lightest , i just could n't get there , ' she explained			2
' i genuinely really tried			0
i was counting calories , i was taking diet pills , i was dabbling in starvation			0
' i thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful			0
and i thought i would never be beautiful at this size			0
' who 's laughing now ? @entity51 recently revealed that when she first moved to @entity104 to pursue modeling in 2010 , beauty companies rejected her for being ' too big ' but she is now one of the most sought - after models since giving calorie - counting the boot , @entity51 has shot to fame and has followed in the footsteps of fellow high - profile models , @entity190 and @entity191 - both of whom are as much admired for their curves as they are for their beauty			2
although she was recently signed by @entity196 to front its new plus - size range , @entity198 , which starts at a size 12 , @entity51 is irritated that the industry continues to see her as only catering to a ' niche ' market			0
