by @entity0 for @entity2 , and @entity3 , the @entity1 now gets very real			1
on thursday , for the first time since qualification was confirmed on october 15 , 2013 , it can be taken away from them			2
there is a permutation of results in @entity11 that would see @entity2 removed from meaningful competition by 3pm , local time , on friday			1
another sequence would make progress a possibility in mathematical terms alone			2
lose to @entity17 and , if @entity18 and @entity19 draw , @entity2 are out			1
lose to @entity17 and , if there is a winner in the other game , @entity2 would need to be the first team in the history of the @entity1 to go through having been defeated in their opening two games			1
even then , it would require a favour from @entity18 in the last round of group matches			2
@entity32 : @entity2 ready for action : @entity2 captain @entity34 arrives at the team hotel after touching down in @entity36 relaxed : @entity37 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) share a joke but it will be all business against @entity17 on thursday evening under pressure : @entity2 boss @entity3 is in desperate need of a win after defeat to @entity18 in @entity44 knockout football , @entity3 called it , and he is right			1
from here , any team that lost its opening game can not afford a second reversal			2
even a draw would leave @entity2 perilously close to a humiliatingly early return — with @entity19 able to play for a single point in the final match in @entity55			1
for all the praise afforded @entity3 and his players after a spirited performance in @entity44 , the reality is that no margin for error remains			1
@entity2 are vulnerable : to rotten luck , to random events and in particular to the kind of dark arts @entity66 , the @entity67 manager , spoke of when he explained the clash of cultures that will unfold in @entity36			1
‘ i know that for you a handball on the goal - line is cheating , ’ he said			2
‘ but not for us			2
it ’s part of the game			2
’ @entity66 ’s admission suggests that , in @entity17 , the ‘ by any means necessary ’ speech that @entity78 gave on monday would have more sinister meaning			1
@entity78 insisted he did n’t mean he would cheat to win			2
anyone who has seen @entity82 ’s tumble against @entity83 in the victory that helped secure @entity17 ’s play - off place would not be similarly assuaged			1
@entity17 vs @entity2 fan predictions preparation : @entity2 were put through their paces at the @entity89 on wednesday expectation : @entity34 says @entity2 will not treat the @entity17 game like a @entity1 final swap : @entity93 could drop back to his favoured no 10 role in @entity36 on thursday key moments : @entity2 manager @entity3 knows his side must deliver against @entity17 without doubt , @entity82 is a changed man in @entity99 football			1
like @entity100 , @entity101 and many imports to the @entity103 , he has discovered that diving is considered one of football ’s foulest acts in his adopted home			2
if anything , last season , the times he should have had a penalty and was unjustly spurned by the referee must have neared double figures			0
at a @entity1 , in @entity17 ’s colours , it is different			1
a large number of players here see any form of contact as justification to fall			0
there is no controversy , no inquest , no consequence for them			0
@entity129 ’s theatrics saw @entity130 sent off in @entity132 ’s win over @entity133 but passed with barely a comment in @entity135			0
@entity36 ’s stadium may be the home of a club called @entity139 , but there that spirit ends			1
and this is do or die , when @entity82 ’s almost deranged desire to win takes over			0
the downside for @entity17 is no different to that for @entity2 — the threat is greater , in fact , as they have @entity18 to play last			1
@entity82 has been rushed back from injury in what amounts to a rare gamble from coach @entity151			0
@entity2 ’s hope , therefore , is that another bold forward display succeeds in putting distance between the teams , so one fateful moment can not influence the outcome			1
undoubtedly , @entity17 ’s defence is weak			1
it needs to be hit , and hard , to counter the @entity82 effect			0
danger man : @entity17 forward @entity82 , pictured in training on wednesday , is fit to face @entity2 determined : @entity78 admitted he will do everything he possibly can to help @entity2 emerge victorious in @entity36 honest : @entity67 boss @entity66 ( right ) believes @entity17 will go to any length necessary to get a result against @entity3 's side ‘ we believe @entity82 will be back and that will be a big confidence boost for their whole team , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i think we ’d be very foolish if we started basing our ideas about them on one game against @entity19			0
i think we have got to see beyond that and be ready for a very difficult encounter			0
‘ there is no doubt @entity17 are different when @entity82 is in the team			1
football is about the players			0
a team can be organised or not but the bottom line is always “ what players have you got and how many are exceptional ? ” an exceptional player can lift a team			0
we saw @entity188 do it with @entity189			0
’ @entity3 added : ‘ they had never won anything really in @entity18 and then suddenly @entity188 pitched up and they become champions and won the @entity194			1
it does n’t really matter whether you have played against someone or know his game , great players are great players			0
when you talk about @entity83 now it always comes back to @entity199			0
in every team there is one name that is a bit exceptional			0
‘ it is not as if we ’re going into the unknown , though			0
we know how good @entity82 is			0
our players will have to make certain that they deal with him as they do when they play against @entity206			0
‘ he ’s a front player			0
he plays all along that line			0
he makes runs behind defenders , he comes off and gets the ball short			0
he does all the things you want a top player to do			0
all we can do is ensure our defence is compact and we do n’t give him the space to play as he wants			0
’ point to prove : @entity82 is hoping to knock @entity2 out of the @entity1 and get @entity17 's campaign back on track if this is seen as @entity3 reverting to cautious type , he should be indulged			1
against all expectation he went to @entity44 with a very open mind and an even more open game plan , and while @entity2 are likely to field the same attacking team , with perhaps the odd tweak in the positioning , he will win no plaudits this time for an entertaining or encouraging defeat			1
@entity17 were the last of @entity229 ’s qualifiers — needing to win a play - off against @entity231 — and looked distinctly unimpressive without @entity82 against @entity19			1
repeat the level of performance against @entity18 and @entity2 are expected to win			1
fail , and the inquest will delve deeper than the general acceptance that it just was n’t @entity2 ’s day again			1
@entity3 seemed to leave a degree of uncertainty around @entity93 when , asked if he might alter his position from wide on the left , he started talking about refusing to say whether he was in or out			1
nobody had suggested he might be out			0
he is n’t , and should n’t be , but it indicates his future as a certain starter for @entity2 is now up for discussion , behind closed doors as well as in the public arena			2
by returning @entity93 to the middle , as seems likely , @entity3 is hoping to make a virtue of having @entity2 ’s leading goalscorer nearer to goal , where he can inflict most damage			1
he insisted @entity93 ’s performance in @entity44 was not dissected at any great length , suggesting he was happy with what he saw			2
it would be a ferociously brave decision to ditch @entity93 for a match of this significance — and harsh , considering the selfless way he played against @entity18			2
he needs to be given a chance to influence this @entity1 as a match - winner , to come to the party as others with his scoring record have done			0
finding his feet : @entity82 is set for his first piece of action since undergoing a knee operation last month centre of attention : @entity17 fell to a surprise 3 - 1 defeat to @entity19 without @entity82 ( centre ) on saturday the temperature in @entity36 will certainly be friendlier to @entity2 than the @entity278 heat of @entity44 and , bar @entity279 , everyone is fit			1
time to deliver is the hoariest old cliche for @entity2 at @entity1 tournaments , but it is coming round to that moment just the same			2
‘ we did n’t go all - out attack against @entity18 and we wo n’t be saying that against @entity17 , either , but we do have the sort of players that are capable of hurting them , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i thought we played at a very good pace the other night and i do n’t know whether we ’re capable of playing much faster than that			0
we saw that even a top team like @entity18 was tested by the quality of our attacking play and we ’re not going to dispense with any of those weapons			0
’ yet , this time , going down fighting wo n’t be so well received			0
o jogo bonito is worthless without its cutting edge			0
there are a lot of good , attacking teams at this tournament and @entity2 need to join them in the second round			2
this is a match @entity2 should win ; they can get no further here on looks alone .			2

@entity2 face @entity17 in @entity36 needing victory to keep fate in their own hands
@entity3 faces *selection* *dilemma* with @entity93 or @entity312 in no 10 role
