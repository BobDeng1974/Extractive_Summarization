companies use complex international tax structures to divert revenues away from @entity4 , meaning companies including @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity9 are paying minimal amounts of tax despite raking in massive profits locally			1
@entity33 has made an estimated profit of $ 1.01 billion in @entity4 since 2003 but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $ 103 million and paid $ 31 million in tax			2
in 2013 @entity34 paid $ 36 million in tax despite making $ 6.1 billion in @entity4 , while @entity9 paid just $ 7.1 million despite making $ 46.5 million			1

@entity33 which has made an estimated profit of $ 1.01 billion in profits in @entity4 since 2003 , but has only declared a pre-tax profit of $ 103 million and paid $ 31 million in tax mr @entity0 says @entity4 led the charge on tax avoidance throughout last month 's @entity51 summit in @entity52 and is also cracking down on the practice domestically			1
the government has injected 60 new staff into the @entity56 to uncover culprits			0
mr @entity0 says there are ' new and stronger ' links between the @entity56 and other tax offices around the world and clever accounting to hide profits is ' coming to an end '			0
