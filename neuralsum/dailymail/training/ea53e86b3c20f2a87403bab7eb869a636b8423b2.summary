two @entity1 actors who dressed up as police officers in a candid camera style stunt have been given suspended jail sentences after one of the people they tried to fool collapsed with a heart attack			1
and ironically the man who almost died and who was left permanently disabled and in a wheelchair as a result of the prank was being filmed as part of a @entity15 charity project tackling the issues of disability			1
the project organisers had hired two well - known @entity1 actors and dressed them up as disabled policemen who flagged down motorists and told them they were being fined for speeding			1
one was in a wheelchair while the other used crutches , with the idea being to gauge people 's reaction to being stopped for speeding by disabled policeman			2
as a result @entity49 , 50 , and @entity50 , 48 , ended up in court charged with impersonating police officers after an investigation prompted by a complaint from the man 's family			1
the @entity58 in @entity48 stressed that both actors were not on trial for causing harm to the man but for impersonating police officers , together with the director and the producer of the short clip , which was shown on television , although not including the part where the man collapsed with a heart attack			1
trial : actors @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 were found guilty of impersonating police officers however video director @entity74 and producer @entity75 were found not guilty because they did not wear police uniforms			1
judge @entity78 said to the pair : ' it needs to be made quite clear why you are here			0
impersonating a police officer is a serious offence regardless of how good the intentions			2
' the actors however have pleaded not guilty and said that they thought it was obvious , given the bad quality of the uniforms , that it was just a sketch			2
the two actors are now considering taking legal action against @entity15 for getting them to break the law			0
in the latest hearing , the actors through their lawyers , claimed that they had simply ' followed the screenplay and contract as provided by @entity15 '			0
one of the drivers , who was not named in the trial , collapsed with a heart attack when he realised he was being filmed by @entity1 tv cameras but this was rejected by the judge @entity78 who said : ' both of them are mature adults and quite capable of thinking for themselves			1
they must know what the law is			0
and they were not forced into doing this			0
' but outside the court @entity49 rejected the judge 's remarks saying : ' according to the verdict of the court it now seems that all of my acting colleagues will have to make sure they take a lawyer with them into the dressing room to avoid being prosecuted			2
if they do n't , they could also end up with the same thing happening to them			0
' his fellow actor @entity50 however was less combative and reserved his comments to apologise for what happened to the victim			2
he said : ' i am really sorry about it			0
i did not expect that there would be someone who would n't recognise us			0
' @entity50 is a well - known @entity140 theatre and film actor , who is himself a disabled man			1
he became confined to a wheelchair after damaging his spine in a car accident in 1988 .			0

two @entity1 actors dressed as disabled policemen for a tv prank
the idea was to raise awareness about disability - but it backfired
*tragically* , they gave a motorist a heart attack after issuing a speeding fine
the pair , @entity49 and @entity50 , then ended up in court
they were found guilty of impersonating police officers by a @entity48 court
