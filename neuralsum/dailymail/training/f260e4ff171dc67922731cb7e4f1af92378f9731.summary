' denial of service attacks have become increasingly common offences in recent years and can have a devastating effect on the victim ’s online business			2

' they used their intimate , expert knowledge of online business to attempt to bully the victims into submission			2
but make no mistake , they may have been using the latest technology , but this was simply good old - fashioned blackmail			2
' they behaved like a couple of sinister playground bullies who thought they could use the threat of financial annihilation to extort compliance from these companies			0
' but their greed was ultimately their downfall as they failed to reckon with the victims ’ bravery in the face of extreme intimidation			0
' the moment our officers arrested them will no doubt live long in their memories as it as at that point they must have realised the game was up			0
