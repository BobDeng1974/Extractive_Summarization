at @entity2 ’s training ground , the staff are getting used to @entity3 walking around sipping the traditional @entity5 drink mate			1
he orders the stuff by the box load , sharing it with his coaching staff in the manager ’s office as they swap ideas after training sessions			0
it is a reminder of home and yet @entity3 has already settled into life as the the club ’s latest new manager			1
it feels like a good fit			0
in @entity3 they have a manager without any connections , historical or otherwise , to the club , or loyalty to the players and coaching staff			1
the @entity52 is a clean break from the club ’s past			0
@entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were all championed by the chairman when they were appointed			0
they all left via the back door			0
@entity66 pretty much cracked it with those two , fourth placed finishes , but the club has to move on from those glorious @entity71 nights at some point			0
this is as good a time as any			0
life is good for @entity3 , with two impressive victories in his opening two matches in the @entity40			1
at @entity81 , on the opening day of the season , it was important to break the cycle of three successive defeats - ‘ @entity89 ’ as @entity85 fans had come to call it - against @entity88 ’s team			0
last sunday , when they picked off @entity38 at @entity92 , there was a swagger about their football			1
that ’s what @entity2 fans are after and that is what they deserve after so much mediocrity			1
@entity3 is the man to give it to them after transferring the methods he used so successfully at @entity105 to the grander stage at @entity2			1
more is expected of him now			0
inevitably he has repaired the fractured relationship with @entity108 , the @entity52 winger who made just a handful of appearances last season			1
after spending £ 30m to sign him from @entity113 last summer , it was important to get back onside			0
@entity3 , who spoke at length with @entity116 about the winger ( he and @entity108 played together at @entity113 ) , wasted no time			1
@entity108 , who was 21 when he was signed by @entity60 , struggled to settle in @entity118 initially			1
he spent most of last season recovering from a fractured vertebra and vowed to make an impact under @entity2 ’s new regime			1
@entity108 idol ? @entity2 winger @entity108 has started this campaign well after a poor first season @entity126 words : @entity3 spoke to @entity116 about @entity108 , to try to get the best out of the winger in the 4 - 0 destruction of @entity130 last sunday , he showed that he will be able to light up the place with that magic left boot			1
he is a shy and introverted boy , but @entity3 is determined to bring the best out of him when he pulls on the @entity2 shirt			1
that is the art of management , something @entity3 was noted for during his spell on the south coast at @entity105			1
he formed a bond with the best players , sparring with @entity143 , captain @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 when they arrived for training each morning			2
it 's all about you : @entity3 ( left ) points at his coaching staff @entity150 ( third right ) , @entity150 ( second right ) and @entity152 ( right ) during the victory over @entity38 goalden wonder : @entity29 heads in to cap a superb move , encapsulating @entity3 's start at @entity92 @entity3 warmed to @entity143 , encouraging the left back when he broke into the @entity105 team and telling him that he could go on to be one of the best in the world in his position			2
he also has an exceptional coaching team , with goalkeeper coach @entity162 ranked among the best in the world in this highly specialised position			0
@entity162 , a former @entity166 keeper , won gold at the 1992 @entity168 with @entity169			0
by all accounts , he is the business			0
@entity172 and @entity152 , who also worked with @entity3 at @entity105 , are integral members of his coaching unit			2
he trusts their judgement , using them as assessors in the opening weeks on the training ground as they worked out the best way to play with the team he inherited			0
@entity3 ’s training sessions are first class , played at high - tempo and in line with the pressing game that he introduced when he was manager at @entity105			2
he takes the sessions himself			0
it has been a neat and tidy start to life in north @entity118 for @entity3 , bring a smile to the face of @entity43 after yet another traumatic period at the club			2
in their sights : @entity2 are determined to sign @entity146 ( right ) before the transfer deadline he intends to back the head coach again in the transfer market and the pair are determined to sign @entity146 before the deadline on monday			1
before that they play @entity203 , the team who trampled all over them at @entity92 last season			2
@entity207 ’ side scored five without reply in december last year and @entity60 was sacked by @entity43 the following day			0
this time @entity203 feel vulnerable as @entity207 puts together a new team following the departure of @entity211			2
win this one and @entity3 really will be drinking to the future			2
progress gauge : @entity203 lost to @entity215 on monday but will be a big test for @entity2 @entity217 of the table no concern for @entity3			1

@entity3 shares ideas with @entity2 coaches over cups of mate
@entity3 has impressive wins in his first two @entity40 matches
@entity2 fans want to watch a side playing with swagger
a chat with @entity116 helped @entity3 get the best out of @entity108
@entity2 will make another bid for @entity146 before monday
@entity203 on sunday will be the big test for @entity2
