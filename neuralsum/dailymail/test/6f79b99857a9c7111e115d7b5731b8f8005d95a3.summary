@entity0 has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ‘ experiment ’ which has enraged heritage experts			2
furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at @entity9 in @entity10 earlier this year and replaced with four brown leatherette bean bags			1
the move was designed to encourage visitors to ‘ dwell and take in the atmosphere ’ in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the move ‘ misguided ’			1
@entity0 has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library of @entity9 , @entity10 now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nine other of its venues around the country			1
art historian @entity28 , whose blog post on his @entity30 about @entity31 sparked the controversy , told @entity33 : ‘ i suspect the hoo - ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do			1
@entity0 said the beanbag experiment was ' short - term ' pictured : @entity9 , @entity10 ‘ i do n’t think you ’ll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it			2
experimentation and bringing in new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things people might want to see			0
’ @entity0 ’s director of strategy , curatorship and external affairs @entity55 told @entity57 that the trust ‘ presents each house in context ’ and that each is different and treated appropriately			0
he said : ‘ we are not a museum that takes objects , shows them in a display case , shines a light on them and labels them ’			0
but he said this meant that ‘ many visitors find a vast array of objects in front of them , cast a cursory eye over them and do n’t get a great deal from the experience			2
’ he said the beanbag experiment was a short - term arrangement which would not necessarily continue for the whole year			0
but he added : ‘ some of our staff think we should have used a rather different sort of seating and others think it is good as an experiment			0
