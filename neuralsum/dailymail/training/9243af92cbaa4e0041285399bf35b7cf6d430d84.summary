wealthy people hire their children as a way of holding onto their money , the study said			1

the study examined elite businessmen in @entity2 and @entity52 and found the proportion of sons sharing an employer with their father is high			0
the professor of economics at @entity59 , studied workers in @entity2 and @entity52 , but noted the pattern is very probably applicable to the composition of workplaces in more places , including the @entity43 the study said a rise in income of the top one per cent of businessmen , their access to sources of high quality education and enrichment for their children and the inter-generational transmission of employers and wealth , ' implies a much higher rate of transmission of economic advantage at the very top , in a way that many will perceive as evidence of inequality in opportunity '			0

writing in the study , he said : ' evidence suggests that more inequality of incomes ... is likely to make family background play a stronger role in determining the adult outcomes of young people , with their own hard work playing a commensurately weaker role			0
' the research found inter-generational earnings mobility is low in countries with more inequality , such as the @entity43 @entity113 and the @entity114			2
earnings mobility is much higher in @entity117 countries such as @entity52 where income is distributed more equally			0

dr @entity25 said countries with more inequality at one point in time also experience less earnings mobility across the generations , which he has illustrated with a chart dubbed ' @entity124 ' the study says : ' the interaction between families , labour markets and public policies all structure a child 's opportunities and determine the extent to which adult earnings are related to family background '			1
dr @entity25 suggested these factors will probably curb earnings mobility across generations and arguably deter less advantaged @entity43 coming - of - age from climbing up the corporate ladder in a polarised labour market			2
he wrote : ' this trend will likely continue unless there are changes in public policy that promote the human capital of children in a way that offers relatively greater benefits to the relatively disadvantaged '			0
