a mother of five whose two - year - old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she ' cried with happiness ' after her campaign to stop her son ’s help being cut was successful			1
@entity9 pleaded with the @entity10 after they announced they were going to take away the highly - trained nurse who helps look after her son @entity13 one day a week			1
@entity13 has @entity14 and also has a tracheostomy , which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment			1
‘ we have to monitor him around the clock			2
it 's already highly stressful and exhausting , and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by , ’ mrs @entity9 wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people			1
two - year - old @entity24 has a tracheostomy , which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment @entity13 is feed with a tube and his mother @entity28 has to monitor him 24 hours a day the 27 - year - old found out on friday morning that the @entity30 will reinstate @entity13 ’s nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help			1
the family live in @entity36 , in @entity37 , about an hour and a half from @entity39 , and living rurally means their local hospital is n't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy			1
mrs @entity9 , who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet , said the response has been ‘ overwhelming ’			1
‘ i cried i was so happy			0
it just means so much			2
it means i will be able to manage , to look forward to things and plan things again , ’ mrs @entity9 told @entity49			1
on mrs @entity9 ’s moving change.org petition she wrote : ‘ it 's a scary weight to carry around , knowing that it 's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive ' mother @entity9 pleaded with the @entity10 after they announced they were going to take away the carer who helps look after her son @entity59 one day a week ‘ i can do all the things everyone takes for granted again – one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death			1
‘ i can get in the car and just breathe , ’ she said			0
mrs @entity9 is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays			1
‘ @entity13 ca n’t go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out , ’ she said			2
‘ and i can get my hair done and go food shopping , pay the bills , get in and out of the car , have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things			0
’ the mother described how @entity13 ‘ absolutely adores ’ the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is ‘ very particular with people ’			1
having a nurse for @entity13 means mrs @entity9 can take her four other children , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , to the cinema and the beach in the school holidays @entity13 ' absolutely adores ' the nurse who looks after him one day a week , mrs @entity9 said over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the @entity95 as @entity13 begins major re-constructive surgery			1
the relief mrs @entity9 feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help – at least for the foreseeable future – is palpable			1
‘ if anything it will get worse , not him but the issues he faces			0
for example he does n’t get head colds , it goes straight through his lungs … he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick , ’ she said describing the challenges ahead			0
@entity14 syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head			0
it prevents the skull , cheek and jawbones from developing properly , causing facial defects and hearing loss			0
about one child in every 50,000 is affected			0
problems range in severity from mild to very severe			0
in most cases , the child ’s intelligence is normal			0
‘ he will also have some big surgery			0
from next year he will have a jaw … they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward			2
he will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood			0
‘ there is no guarantee that he ’ll ever not need a feeding tube			0
’ on mrs @entity9 ’s moving change.org petition she wrote : ‘ it 's a scary weight to carry around , knowing that it 's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive			1
it 's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies should n't have to bear just because they live in a rural area			2
‘ that 's not right			0
we ca n't easily just move			0
we own our home , we 'd need to uproot our other children , we have family here , we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town			0
we just want to safely be able to include our son in that future			0
’ the family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals			2
‘ this is my son 's life at stake			2
it 's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected			1
right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens , and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients , ’ she wrote			1
the family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals			2

@entity9 lives with her son @entity13 and four other children in rural sa
@entity13 has a tracheostomy , which means his airway is compromised
he needs to be monitored around the clock so that he can breathe
the government told @entity28 they were *scrapping* @entity13 's nurse
the highly - trained nurse visits the boy one day a week
it gives @entity28 a break to run *errands* and take her other children out
she pleaded with the government in an online petition which 37,000 people signed and on friday they announced they would reinstate the nurse
