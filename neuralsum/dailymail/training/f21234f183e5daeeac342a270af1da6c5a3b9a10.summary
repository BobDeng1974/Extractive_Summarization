because i do n't have to tell you that all over our country today , there are people working harder and harder , but standing still : families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages ; young people , taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education , only to find themselves with no job at the other end ; and an @entity59 where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need			0
