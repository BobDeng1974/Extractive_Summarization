by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 11:09 est , 1 january 2014 @entity2 scouts have again been in attendance at @entity5 's fixtures as they continue to monitor @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity5 have asked about @entity10 's teenage striker @entity9			1
the father of the highly - rated 17 year - old , @entity11 , admits his son could be on the move after claiming @entity14 have been trying to hide him from @entity15 and @entity16 by keeping scouts away from games			1
@entity19 is continuing to look for younger talent as well as those ready to step into the first team			0
@entity5 's playing staff is ready for an overhaul and they are keen to have better quality youngsters coming through which will also mean further tweaks to @entity5 's scouting set - up at home and abroad			1
@entity31 quality : @entity6 ( centre ) is being tracked by @entity2 @entity33 asked about taking @entity34 on loan but @entity5 are not keen to do their rivals any favours			1
@entity34 is available but a move abroad is more likely			1
@entity19 still wants a left - back but will not be bidding for @entity40 or @entity41			0
@entity33 have already moved onto other left - back targets and are determined to sign a second striker in the january window			0
@entity45 's much - heralded £ 6million move to @entity47 should be formally announced by the @entity49 side next week with the @entity51 striker linking up with his new team ahead of the @entity49 season in march			1
no go : @entity19 will not bid for @entity40 ( left ) or @entity41 meanwhile , @entity47 defender @entity55 is keen on a return to @entity51			2
the 24 - year - old has offers from @entity59 and @entity60 but the former @entity2 full back is open to a deal in the @entity63			0
@entity64 face a tough task to persuade @entity66 to leave @entity67			1
chairman @entity68 has moved to save his club by changing tack on their initial transfer policy and putting an offer to @entity67 for the 31 - year - old @entity51 striker			0
@entity64 were planning to just bring in two strikers on loan mindful that relegation would leave them with a financial headache			2
now they have opted to take a gamble and make a bid that would be attractive to @entity67 and the player			0
goal threat : @entity66 ( right ) may bolster @entity64 's goal - shy attacking line - up @entity66 is very settled at @entity67 but , as he is n't starting every week , @entity84 senses an opportunity to bring him to @entity86 with the prospect of regular football every week in the build up to the @entity90			1
should @entity92 make his return , it could also prove an @entity51 audition for a rumbustious partnership which few defences would fancy facing			0
@entity64 are still lining up other options in case the plan fails			0
they have asked about @entity100 at @entity101 although that has been rebuffed but loan deals are ready to move over the next week should they get the ok on finance			2
they have considered @entity107 , 21 , from @entity108 but he is expected to move elsewhere			2
@entity110 's @entity109 will be announced as a @entity64 player in the next few days			2
@entity112 may yet turn down @entity114 's overtures when they make a move for him this week			1
manager @entity116 is considering a £ 4million bid for the @entity118 forward but @entity112 may yet see out his contract			1
@entity120 have also made approaches for @entity112 , who has been watched by @entity123 and @entity108			1
@entity124 have made the 21 - year - old a new contract offer but , if he goes abroad , the @entity63 side will get around £ 155,000 in compensation , as opposed to a few million if he moves in @entity51			0
snub ? @entity124 forward @entity112 may turn down @entity114 's advances in the january window @entity16 's @entity132 could be the latest @entity134 export to the @entity49			1
the 31 - year - old is ready to leave @entity136 with clubs in the @entity138 and across the @entity139 alerted by comments from his agent @entity141 early this week			2
@entity132 has been linked with @entity143 but he has grander ambitions the west @entity146 club , who formally completed the signing of 18 - year - old midfielder @entity149 on wednesday , are monitoring @entity151 winger @entity150 but are unsure about a bid as the player looks a few years short of development			1
the 21 - year - old @entity155 has impressed scouts but seems more likely to move to @entity157 with @entity123 among his potential suitors			1
frozen out : @entity132 has spent much of this season on the bench for @entity16 @entity161 are continuing to develop their youth ranks and will hold talks with another @entity165 teenager on thursday			1
@entity166 is from the @entity167 in @entity168 and is a teammate of striker @entity170 from @entity173 's @entity172 squad			2
@entity166 is a left - sided midfielder who can also play behind the striker or as a left - back			2
he is due to fly to @entity51 with his parents tomorrow for talks in the hope of concluding a dream transfer to @entity161			1
@entity170 's deal with @entity161 now looks back on after hitting a hitch , seemingly over money , last @entity182 football website @entity180 reported : ' both the agents in the @entity187 and those in @entity146 are now co-operating to get visas to the @entity190 for the @entity191 so that they meet with @entity161 officials on the contract they have signed			1
you could therefore say the transfer is back on track			0
' winning feeling : @entity161 , who are after 17 - year - old @entity165 @entity166 , beat @entity114 3 - 2 with @entity198 ( right ) scoring the third issues to be discussed would include the january 2015 payments to the player , his father and the @entity203 in @entity204			1
the @entity191 recently signed for @entity161 in @entity205 , @entity206 , after @entity170 passed a medical attended by @entity161 ’s chief scout @entity208			1
however , when they discovered they would not be paid immediately due to his age , they explored the possibilities of reviving interest at @entity212			0
there were rumours too that @entity170 ’s @entity187 - based agent tried to offer the 17 - year - old to @entity219 @entity218 club @entity217			0
@entity101 have made an enquiry for @entity222 defender @entity221			0
the 17 - year - old has also been a target for @entity225			0
the @entity228 @entity227 star can play at centre half and full back and @entity101 may make an offer this week			0
they are continuing to work the @entity234 market with success and , as reported previously in @entity236 , are ready to have another go for @entity239 striker @entity238 who is out of contract in the summer and attracting interest from @entity243 and @entity120			0
on his way ? @entity238 could be the latest @entity228 star to sign for @entity246 club @entity101 @entity101 defender @entity247 is still keen to get back playing top - level football and is looking to leave @entity249 on loan			1
the 27 - year - old defender has not figured since being sent off against @entity161 in august and has been urged to wait for his chance by manager @entity253 but although he could figure in the @entity255 this weekend , his patience could run out if the situation continues			1
even though @entity247 is a supporter of the club , he is prepared to leave on loan to revive his career			2
meanwhile , @entity101 winger @entity260 is wanted by @entity262 side @entity261			0
which @entity134 star is looking to leave the country after running into trouble with too many female friends ? the powerful midfielder is a popular figure at his club in more ways than one			1
although not married , he has three regular girlfriends on the go and is keen for a fresh start			2

@entity314 remains keen on @entity2 's @entity315 also as do @entity114 and is continuing to monitor developments with @entity317 and the more expensive target , @entity319 of @entity320			1
in demand : @entity312 is sought after by both @entity310 and , surprisingly , @entity205 @entity120 are hoping to tie up a deal for @entity324 defender @entity323 amid talk he is leaving his long - time agent			0
@entity324 are keen to lose @entity323 's estimated £ 35,000 a week wages and have other eyes on other defenders			1
