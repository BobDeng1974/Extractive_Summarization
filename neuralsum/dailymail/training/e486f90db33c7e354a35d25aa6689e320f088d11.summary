@entity0 and @entity1 will learn if they have futures at @entity4 in the coming days			1
the former long - serving players were both involved in the coaching set - up last season but are unsure if they will be asked to continue under new manager @entity8			1
@entity1 helped out with the reserves prior to @entity28 sacking , before working under former interim boss and current assistant manager @entity32			1
when speaking to @entity33 said : ' i am still at @entity4 , and think my future will be resolved in the next five days			1
' i am speaking to the chief executive very soon and then it will all be sorted			0
it might be the case that i might have to go and pursue other areas for next season			2
' but i think i will always be involved in some capacity at @entity4			2
once you are a part of @entity4 you are part of it for life			2
on the ball : @entity1 and @entity0 keep a watchful eye on events at the @entity9 ' i came back into football 12 months because @entity28 asked me to come back			1
' i probably would n’t have come into coaching if it had n’t been for the fact i was working for @entity28 at @entity4			2
the opportunity was too good to turn down			0
' i thoroughly enjoyed my 12 months in coaching			0
it is something i really want to do and it will be something i do in the future			0
' heads up : @entity1 rolls back the years by getting involved in the training session on thursday @entity0 and @entity1 in action for @entity4 during their playing days @entity1 , 39 , worked as assistant to @entity62 with the under - 21 side and managed the under - 19s in the @entity65			1
the under - 19 role will not be available next season as the @entity65 mirrors the @entity68 , which the @entity4 senior side have failed to qualify for			1
@entity1 said : ' it is a bit unstable at the minute because the manager has not been with us			2
' he has had bigger things on his mind with @entity76 but hopefully over the next couple of weeks he will be in training and we will sit down and discuss what role , if any , i have got			0
' if i have , then great			0
if not , i ’ve had a fantastic time			0
i am back in training now but if there is not a job for me there is no point staying			0
' pointing the finger : @entity0 in conversation with former @entity4 manager @entity28 and @entity88 at a training session at @entity90 last season reunited : @entity4 assistant manager @entity32 with @entity93 at a @entity15 training session on thursday ' they want me there , and i want to be there but it has got to be for a purpose			1
the only one that can make that decision is obviously the manager and the owners			0
' despite that uncertainty , @entity1 feels @entity4 have much to look forward to under a manager who impressed in guiding @entity76 to the @entity108 semi-finals			1
he said : ' it is an exciting time			0
i think everyone will be pleased when he finally arrives and takes his first training session and starts drilling our players like he did with the @entity115 lads , because he got some great results out of them			0
' the pair , along with @entity93 , @entity118 and @entity32 , invested in @entity119 @entity10 earlier this year .			1
