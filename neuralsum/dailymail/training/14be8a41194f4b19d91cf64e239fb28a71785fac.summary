@entity0 has shown @entity1 just what they were missing as the former @entity1 captain throws punches and kicks in a personal training session			2
it was , perhaps , the style of defence that @entity1 could have done with as @entity9 and @entity11 striker @entity10 almost single - handedly left @entity13 's @entity12 in tatters			1
@entity0 has had no competitive football to prepare for , having retired from the national team in 2012 , but looks to be keeping himself in shape ahead of @entity20 's next @entity19 campaign			0
missing : former @entity1 captain @entity0 in a gym session throws punches with his personal trainer wanted : @entity1 could have done with that kind of defence to stop @entity9 menace @entity10 kicking out : @entity0 retired from international football in 2012 but is keeping himself fit for pre-season @entity0 , who retired before a contentious trial for alleged racial abuse of former @entity32 player @entity31 , has taken to the social media platform with time on his hands over the summer			1
along with the video , @entity0 wrote : ' @entity36 done @entity37 ' @entity0 's displays at @entity20 warranted calls from the media for him to return for the tournament in @entity42 , but the defender had already decided 78 caps were enough			0
instead , @entity13 took @entity0 's @entity20 team - mate @entity45 , @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 duo @entity48 and @entity50 to act as his four central defenders			0
@entity1 now go to their final game against @entity53 in the hope of pulling off the seemingly impossible in @entity55 they need @entity56 to beat @entity9 , and need to claim their first win of the @entity12 themselves			0
all but out : @entity1 's @entity12 campaign took a major hit , courtesy of @entity11 talisman @entity10 gutted : @entity1 are as good as out after their loss to @entity9 in @entity55 - their second of the tournament clinical : @entity9 striker @entity10 scored twice as @entity1 's @entity12 was left in tatters @entity68 needs @entity70 miracle			1

@entity0 won 78 caps for @entity1 before retiring internationally
@entity0 retired in *september* 2012 *shortly* before being found *guilty* of racially
@entity1 lost 2 - 1 to @entity9 as @entity10 scored twice in @entity55
