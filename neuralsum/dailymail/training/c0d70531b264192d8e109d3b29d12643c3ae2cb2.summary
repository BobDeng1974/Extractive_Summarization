by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity1 is @entity3 football 's most expensive defender ever , but the new @entity5 recruit was put through his paces in training on tuesday , and may have realised the step up from the @entity9 to the @entity10 is bigger than he thought			1
@entity5 needed more numbers at centre - back after injuries to @entity19 and @entity34 left them short last term			1
@entity36 also left on a free transfer to @entity38			0
@entity1 , who is eligible to face @entity39 at @entity40 on sunday , is expected to form a centre - back partnership with captain @entity19 , but admitted the holiday period was ' too long ' upon his arrival at @entity5			1
working hard : @entity1 admitted he tried to keep fit in what was a ' long summer ' for the @entity46 taking a break : @entity1 takes a drink ( right ) as manager @entity49 looks on ( left ) @entity1 said : ‘ i am happy now because i will be able to start a new adventure			1
i will be able to train again			0
it was good to be on holidays , but after a time i started to find the time quite long			2
‘ i went on a run every day and trained in the gym			2
holidays are great but if the time is too long , it is difficult to come back			2
i think that i will need a bit of time but i will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible			2
' @entity1 , 23 , became @entity5 ’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five - year deal , and manager @entity63 is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in @entity66 will prove to be well worth the money			1
recruit : @entity1 is the most expensive defender in @entity3 football history at £ 31.9million ‘ i ’m delighted to have added a player of @entity1 ’s quality in the squad , ’ said @entity63 , who saw his defence struggle in the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity73 in sunday ’s @entity74			1
‘ he is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental , physical , technical and tactical attributes to become one of @entity66 ’s very best defenders			0
' record breaker : @entity1 has finally signed for @entity5 for £ 32m rarely seen : @entity1 , consoling @entity83 , did not play a minute at the @entity84 @entity5 tried to sign @entity1 and @entity12 pal @entity29 in january but it ’s taken until the summer to seal deals			1
why the delay ? everything seemed ready to go last month , but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights			0
@entity12 only received £ 23m of the £ 31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to @entity95			0
but is n’t he @entity46 ? he was born in @entity97 but moved to @entity98 at five , where he started as a striker			1
@entity102 converted him to a defender and sold him to @entity12 for £ 6m			0
he is one of four frenchmen at @entity105 , along with @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
despite his fee he could n’t get a game for @entity111 at the @entity84 and was their fourth - choice centre back			0
did n’t @entity25 want him ? and @entity26			0
asked about his preference in may , he said : ‘ @entity5 or @entity26 ? @entity26 because it ’s @entity115			2
’ how will he fit into @entity5 's backline ? @entity1 has the tools — power , pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for @entity19			1
and does n't he still retain some of that striker 's instinct ? he does - last season he scored three times in @entity126 competition ( in the @entity127 and @entity128 )			2
did n’t @entity66 cap @entity5 ’s net spend this summer at £ 49m ? yes , and they ’ve spent £ 49.9m on @entity1 , @entity29 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
@entity106 was free and @entity134 is on loan			0
they got £ 10m from @entity137 for @entity138 and £ 12m will follow when @entity139 joins @entity140			0

@entity1 trained for the first time since his big - money move to @entity5
the @entity46 defender has become @entity63 's sixth summer signing
he is eligible to face @entity39 at @entity40 this sunday
@entity1 looked tired after a tough workout at @entity14 on tuesday
