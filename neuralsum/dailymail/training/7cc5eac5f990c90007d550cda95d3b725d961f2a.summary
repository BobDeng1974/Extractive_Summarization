by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 03:01 est , 18 december 2012 broadside : conservative justice secretary @entity2 has accused @entity4 lawmakers of overstepping their authority and deciding matters best left to domestic courts a senior cabinet minister last night accused @entity4 human rights judges of ‘ overstepping the mark ’ - in a significant ratcheting up of hostilities with the @entity14 court			1
justice secretary @entity2 ’s remarks are the strongest condemnation to date of the controversial court from a @entity19 minister			1
he accuses the judges of prying ‘ more and more ’ into areas that should be decided in domestic courts or by mps in @entity24			1
his explosive comments came ahead of the publication today of the final report by a panel of experts set up to examine a replacement to @entity32 ’s @entity31			2
but the ‘ @entity34 on a @entity35 ’ which was set up by @entity36 to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws - is expected to recommend yet more rights			1
these could include a right to claim benefits , to have a pleasant environment to live in and to enjoy a comfortable standard of living			2
insiders said the commission had split ‘ down the middle ’ between @entity19 and @entity47 placed on the commission by @entity49			0
mr @entity2 accuses the judges of moving ‘ further and further away ’ from the original @entity51 - written in the aftermath of the @entity53 to protect citizens against the horrors of @entity56			1
and he says a @entity58 view of human rights is that ‘ with rights come responsibilities ’ - and that rights should not be used as an excuse for operating outside societal norms			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the human rights agenda that frustrates so many of us today has little to do with the freedoms that all of us still believe are worth fighting for			1
‘ over more than half a century , the @entity69 in @entity14 has moved further and further away from the intentions of those politicians who shaped the original convention			0
‘ it has pried more and more into matters that should be routine issues for national courts and parliaments to deal with			1
' he added : ‘ as conservatives we remain absolutely committed to the importance of human rights around the world			1
but we do not believe that people should be able to claim the right to family life as an excuse for operating outside the norms that apply to most people in our society			0
we believe that with rights come responsibilities			2
‘ and we believe that the @entity69 has overstepped its mark , and that things have to change			0
' mr @entity2 ’s comments will be welcomed by @entity19 backbenchers who have demanded ministers confront the @entity4 court over its rulings			1
@entity100 : the @entity69 in the @entity102 city of @entity14			0
mr @entity2 says it has moved too far from its purpose of protecting the vulnerable they are particularly robust given his other position in @entity108 as lord chancellor , who by tradition does not criticise members of the judiciary			1
article 8 has been used by hundreds of foreign prisoners to stay in @entity115 despite committing horrific crimes using spurious claims about their right to a private and family life			0
it has also allowed paedophiles and rapists to demand removal from the @entity124 ’ register			0
the commission ’s interim report in july recommended creating a right to claim benefits , and other so - called ‘ socio - economic rights ’			2
it also called for new children ’s rights and a ‘ right to equality ’			2
at the time , critics said the commission had been hijacked by the human rights lobby and would lead to further rights inflation and an extension of the compensation culture			1
an eminent academic , dr @entity140 , quit the commission warning that the ‘ the @entity47 tail is wagging the @entity58 dog ’ as he claimed @entity49 and @entity144 had instructed the commission to ignore the will of @entity24			0
mr @entity2 is engaged in a standoff with the court over its demands for an end to the ban on prisoners voting			1
rights : the original @entity51 was written after @entity53 to try and prevent horrors similar to @entity155 ( pictured ) @entity14 has threatened to hand inmates compensation of £ 1000 each if @entity115 does not pass a law giving them the vote - despite mps voting overwhelming against a change			2
earlier this month , 71 @entity19 mps , including former crime and justice minister @entity163 called on ministers to scrap the @entity31 in a parliamentary vote			2
the vote , and the commission ’s likely outcome , will heap pressure on @entity36 to take a tougher line on @entity14			0
last night dr @entity140 said @entity115 should withdraw if it can not negotiate a ‘ democratic override ’ to allow @entity24 to reject @entity14 rulings			0
dr @entity174 , constitutional affairs expert at @entity176 said : ‘ even if the @entity34 does decide to publish a @entity115 @entity35 , it is likely that the @entity14 court will have final say on matters of national significance such as prisoner voting			0
‘ the @entity115 must alter its relationship with the international court			0
firstly by trying to negotiate an ‘ override ’ so that national parliaments can overrule @entity14			0
‘ if this proves impossible then the @entity115 should give serious consideration to withdrawing from the @entity51			0

justice secretary says @entity4 human rights judges are *interfering* with domestic issues
they have ' lost sight ' of the core principles behind human rights
rights are ' too open to abuse ' , mr @entity2 added
