the five were released to perform for the crowds as part of the launch of a pre-christmas ' @entity10 ' at a shopping centre			0
but last night the event 's organisers were condemned after it emerged they are actually @entity15 penguins – tropical birds which will never have seen ice before			1
professor @entity37 , of @entity38 , who has studied penguins for 32 years , said : ' @entity40 are a tropical penguin used to a very warm climate in @entity35 and they will never , ever come across ice in their natural environment			1
if they looked cold then they probably were			0
' a spokesman for @entity46 said of the event at @entity49 's one shopping complex three weeks ago : ' this can only have left them petrified and disoriented			1
' tv cameras rolled as a keeper tried to coax the birds with fish as they walked around the arena			0
@entity46 , which has celebrity supporters including @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , slammed the event as ‘ disrespectful , out of touch and tragic ’			1
entertainment : children and parents watched as the penguins walked across the ice rink in @entity49 out of their comfort zone ? @entity46 said the animals could have been left petrified and disorientated away from home : the animals belong in the water and on rocky islands off the coast of @entity26 , @entity46 said this is unlike other species of penguin , such as the emperor penguin , which enjoys the snow and ice and freezing conditions of the @entity28			1
a spokesperson from @entity46 said : ‘ anyone who has seen the beautiful film @entity84 would find this publicity stunt disrespectful , out of touch and tragic			1
‘ as the movie illustrates these fascinating birds have a rich and free life			0
‘ they do not deserve to be exploited as props , kept in tiny enclosures and denied all that is natural and familiar to them			0
‘ forcing penguins to endure the stress of being hauled around and released onto a patch of ice in front of hordes of shoppers can only leave them petrified and disoriented			2
’ on show : the five penguins were coaxed across the ice as spectators looked on day out in @entity49 : the penguins were showcased to shoppers in the city they added that penguins can transmit numerous diseases that can be harmful to pregnant women			2
‘ it is reckless and cruel to take @entity15 penguins or any animals and deliberately place them in a frightening and wholly unsuitable environment such as a tiny ice enclosure when they belong in the water and on the rocky islands off the coast of @entity26			1
’ @entity122 , a vet at @entity123 in @entity124 , which owns the penguins , said : ' at no time have the penguins exhibited any distress in their surroundings			2
' a spokesman for @entity23 said : ' @entity23 prides itself on only working with reputable suppliers , we have a robust process in place to ensure that the health and safety of our shoppers , staff and suppliers is always of paramount importance in everything we do			0
' the company that brought the penguins to @entity23 is held in high regard in their industry			2
they have worked with high profile entertainment and educational organisations on an international scale and are experts in their field			0
' based on expert advice we are confident that the welfare of the penguins was always their priority			0

@entity15 penguins live on rocky islands on the warm @entity33 waters of @entity34 and @entity35 - not in the @entity28
