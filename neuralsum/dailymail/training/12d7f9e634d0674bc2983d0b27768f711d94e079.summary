iron - fisted @entity1 house speaker @entity0 is moving quickly to punish conservative @entity2 who tried to oust him tuesday during the biennial leadership election			1
hours after the contentious vote , @entity5 rep. @entity4 – who actively campaigned against @entity0 and persuaded 12 @entity7 members to support him – found himself left off the membership list of the powerful @entity10 , where he served for the last two years			1
rep. @entity11 , a fellow @entity5 who voted for him , suffered the same fate			0
' my philosophy , ' @entity4 told reporters after he heard the news that he had been bumped from the committee in a vindictive move , ' is do n’t burn any bridges , do n’t make it personal			0
' ' but that 's not everybody ’s philosophy			0
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) were left off a powerful committee that serves at @entity0 's discretion after they joined a conservative cabal and tried to oust him the speaker of the @entity10 chooses members from his or her own party to serve on the @entity10 , which moves the procedural levers of power as decisions are made about which bills to move to the @entity10 floor 0 and how they 'll be considered			1
@entity0 attracted high - fives among his supporters in the @entity10 for flexing his muscles , even as conservatives ' flak bursts all around him			1
' it 's about time , ' a @entity2 congressman told @entity52 on tuesday evening			1
' this is a new ball game , and the speaker does n't have to put up with childish antics anymore			0
you mess with the bull , you get the horns			2
' the lawmaker spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the changing landscape he referred to reflects a new and enlarged @entity2 majority that will give @entity0 and his allies new breathing room and spare them the strategic problem of how to attract the support of tea party members and others on the party 's right wing			1
with 246 out of 435 @entity10 seats in @entity2 hands – @entity76 control just 188 – centrist @entity2 leaders can now afford to alienate conservatives without risking the embarrassing failure of key pieces of legislation			1
members on @entity0 's right flank , 25 of whom refused to support him on tuesday , have complained that he gave away the store in december with a so - called ' @entity87 ' budget that funded the @entity90 law 's implementation for the rest of the government 's fiscal year			1
the trade - off was putting the @entity95 on a shorter leash – its funding is only guaranteed through the end of february – in the hope of forcing president @entity100 to back off from his promised amnesty of millions of illegal immigrants			2
@entity1 's immigration authorities are part of the @entity95 apparatus			0
but tea party - minded @entity2 who fear @entity0 will give away that bargaining chip next month , rather than risk the backlash that would come with shutting down critical terror - fighting agencies , are now in a much weaker position			1
they could be seen as mere annoyances when the time comes to fight with their speaker again			0
' they p * * * ed him off , ' the @entity7 lawmaker told @entity52			1
' that 's not a good thing to do on the first day of a new @entity118			2
it 's going to be a long two years for some of those guys			0
' @entity122 : @entity0 won his gavel for a third term despite the best efforts of 25 right - wing opponents who had hoped to oust him other congressmen groused on tuesday about the tight discipline and strict loyalty @entity0 has demanded in the past			1
@entity132 rep. @entity131 , who voted for @entity4 in the speaker election , told @entity134 that his decision had cost him a chance to regain a seat on the @entity138 that he lost in 2012			2
' i am already hearing from my colleagues , and myself , about retaliation against those who voted their conscience , their constituents , their principles , to change the status quo , ' he said			2
' my colleagues fully expect that			0
that ’s what they expect out of this leadership team			0
' @entity131 and @entity151 rep. @entity150 also lost their slots on the @entity154 in 2013 after they were among 12 republicans who opposed @entity0 the last time around			1
@entity157 rep. @entity156 and @entity159 rep. @entity158 found themselves dropped from the @entity161 for the same reason			0
but @entity0 and his aides had promised in the run - up to tuesday 's mini-drama that there would be no recriminations			1
' @entity0 has said publicly that there will be no retribution for " no " votes , ' his spokesman @entity168 told @entity172 last week			0
the speaker also told @entity174 in september that no @entity2 would lose their committee assignments if they opposed him			0
' i just do n't think it 's necessary , ' he said then			0
but he also predicted that ' very few ' would defect			0
the 25 who bolted on tuesday – the largest such group in a century – appear to have changed his mind			2
@entity182 @entity181 rep. @entity181 , who chairs the @entity10 , told reporters that the panel ' works at the behest of the speaker , and the speaker – i believe any speaker – would want and need a person focused on that agenda			1
' he added that the @entity10 is a place where ' we do things for the team , ' throwing a rhetorical elbow at ' self - serving ' members			1
' welcome to the new @entity197 ' : rep. @entity198 of @entity182 ( left ) and rep. @entity199 of @entity5 ( right ) were among @entity0 's challengers on tuesday , and @entity199 later said @entity0 's reprisals were ' something i would assume @entity204 would do ' conservative rep. @entity205 of @entity206 joined the cabal and vented his anger after news surfaced that payback was in the air @entity5 rep. @entity199 , who ran for speaker against @entity0 and cast his vote for himself , reacted with frustration on tuesday when he learned that revenge was in the air			1
it was ' a sad day for @entity1 politics , ' he told @entity220 , and ' something i would assume @entity204 would do			1
' as he stepped on an elevator , he shared the news about @entity4 's and @entity11 's demotions with fellow members – well within reporters ' earshot – saying , ' hey , welcome to the new @entity197			2
' @entity182 rep. @entity198 , who was one of the loudest voices calling for @entity0 's ouster , vented on tuesday that the speaker 's retributions risked turning him into ' a sore winner			1
' @entity0 won his gavel for a third consecutive term easily on tuesday despite the coordinated effort to oust him , securing 11 votes more than he needed			2
with 408 lawmakers present , it took 205 votes to win ; @entity0 got 216			0
eighteen @entity76 were absent , mostly due to the funeral of former @entity244 gov. @entity243			0
@entity246 @entity245 rep. @entity245 was waylaid by a flight cancellation caused by snow			0
@entity7 rep. @entity249 officially resigned his seat tuesday following his guilty plea to a charge of tax evasion .			2

25 republicans broke with their leadership and voted against @entity0 on tuesday when he was *re-elected* speaker of the @entity10
some of them saw *swift* retaliation , *including* two who lost seats on the *influential* @entity10 – which the speaker runs
one *likened* the payback to ' something i would assume @entity204 would do '
@entity0 chairs the @entity10 , known as the ' speaker 's committee ' because it 's his principal tool for *maintaining* order day - to - day
he had *pledged* months *ago* that there would be no retaliation against *dissenting* @entity7 members
one congressman said of @entity0 that tea *partiers* ' p * * * ed him off ' and should expect *consequences* : ' you mess with the bull , you get the horns '
