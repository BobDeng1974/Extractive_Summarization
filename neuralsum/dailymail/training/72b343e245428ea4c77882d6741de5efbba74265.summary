the @entity1 government policemen and soldiers in @entity3 abandoned their weapons and uniforms with barely a fight against the army of black - clad killers from the @entity9 terror group			1
the gunmen quickly laid their hands on a mass of abandoned @entity15 military equipment to add to their massive arsenal , ranging from @entity18 vehicles to night - sights and body armour			0
among the first acts of this ruthless force of @entity9 militants was to liberate 2,500 prisoners from two jails - many of them terrorists who immediately joined their ranks			1
the evening before , @entity9 chiefs phoned @entity36 ’s sheiks , and told them to warn policemen and soldiers to lay down their arms or be killed			0
who are @entity9 and why do they inspire such fear ? could they really , as serious commentators and political leaders suggest , threaten not only the entire stability of the @entity51 but also bring a new reign of jihadist terror to the @entity54 ? one thing is certain : this formidable army is a very different beast to the @entity1 branch of @entity59 from which it originated and which fought the @entity15 and the @entity1 government from the 2003 invasion until @entity15 troops left in 2011			1
@entity9 fanatics are hardline followers of the @entity65 creed			0
they despise @entity31 ’s leadership - as well as the majority of the country ’s population - who follow the @entity72 version of the faith			2
this @entity65 / @entity72 divide has been a source of violence across the @entity51 since the 7th century			0
it was kept in check by brutal dictators such as @entity39 , @entity80 and president @entity81			0
extreme : the fighters were once part of @entity59 , which has cut ties with the group			2
they have now taken control of @entity39 's home town tensions : the @entity9 fighters are from the @entity65 branch of @entity92 - as was @entity39 - in contrast to the current @entity72 government but their removal - attempted in the case of @entity97 ’s @entity81 - by gung - ho @entity99 leaders such as @entity101 and @entity102 has re-ignited the bitter hatred with terrifying fervour			1
and @entity9 is the living embodiment of that hatred			0
the sectarian civil war in @entity97 has been the terror group ’s biggest asset			0
in the past they would have been crushed ruthlessly by @entity81 ’s forces , but during the past two years , the war has enabled them to train and shelter militants in the increasingly ungoverned areas between @entity97 and @entity31			1
the group originated in @entity31 and incorporated the @entity116 ( @entity97 ) into its name two years ago to reflect its spearheading of the fight against @entity81			1
later , it fell out with the @entity59 leadership in @entity120 - and redefined itself to become a far more lethal and powerful army than ever operated against @entity99 troops in @entity31 , eclipsing @entity59			1
today , it effectively governs a nation - sized area stretching over north and west @entity31 and @entity97			1
‘ this is a force that is ideologically motivated , battle - hardened and incredibly well - equipped , ’ explains @entity125 , of the @entity126 , who advised the @entity128 and @entity102 administrations on @entity31 and served two tours of duty there			2
‘ it also runs the equivalent of a state			0
it has all the trappings of a state , just not an internationally recognised one			0
’ territory : the above map shows the areas of @entity31 and @entity97 currently controlled by @entity9 forces whereas @entity59 concentrated on counter-insurgency , @entity9 transformed itself into a full - blooded army with thousands of fighting men to call on			1
‘ @entity59 in @entity31 did n’t really fight the @entity15 , ’ explains @entity125			1
‘ they were great bomb - makers and kidnappers , but if caught in a firefight , they would probably get killed because they were n’t good line - infantry , ’ he said			0
‘ now that has been fixed			0
’ the @entity15 congratulated itself on beating @entity59 in @entity31 before it withdrew its troops in 2011 and handed power to the @entity37 government , dispersing $ 14billion of military aid to the @entity1 army			1
but since then , @entity1 jihadists under the control of @entity9 have won control of key towns , such as @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 - and now @entity3 - while carrying out suicide bomb attacks in @entity37 that are causing 1,000 fatalities a month			2
within those areas it has conquered , it is imposing a vicious form of hardline @entity9 sharia law , which has involved crucifixion of ‘ spies ’ , as well as beheadings and amputations			2
violent and mysterious : this undated photograph is one of only a few in existence showing @entity179 , the head of @entity9 the transformation of @entity9 came about under the command of a shadowy 42 - year - old ex-preacher called @entity179 - who was captured in southern @entity31 in 2005 after being identified as @entity59 ’s point man in a flyblown town in @entity31 ’s western desert			1
according to a @entity188 document , he was ‘ connected to the intimidation , torture and murder of civilians , ’ as well as publicly executing ‘ entire families ’			0
astonishingly , he was released in 2009 , possibly because of some amnesty agreement or through confusion - his name is a @entity197 used by several people			0
‘ we either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times , ’ explained lieutenant - general sir @entity199 , a former @entity200 special forces commander who fought @entity59 in @entity31			1
today , with a $ 10million bounty on his head , @entity179 wears masks and avoids being photographed - the only image of him is a @entity15 prison mugshot of a thickset man with cropped hair			0
@entity9 became the richest terror group ever yesterday after stealing £ 256 million from @entity3 ’s central bank			0
@entity214 also comes from shadowy opponents of president @entity81 ’s regime , and it extorts more than £ 600,000 each month from the prosperous citizens of cities such as @entity3 , where it has long been a covert presence			0
in the meantime , it has been recruiting foreign fighters for the war in @entity97			2
some 12,000 have flocked to fight in @entity97 from as far away as @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 - 3,000 of these foreign volunteers are @entity99 , including an estimated 400 @entity200			1
@entity9 ’s aim is to create a @entity230 - style caliphate , where political and religious leadership are fused , in @entity31 and @entity97 , countries which it considers meaningless colonial constructs			1
in order to achieve its vision , the terror group is not only simultaneously fighting @entity81 and the @entity1 regime of pm @entity238 , but also other @entity97 rebel groups that object to its appalling brutality - brutality that has proved even too much for @entity59			1
in addition , to the deep concern of @entity99 governments , @entity9 is encouraging its foreign fighters to commit atrocities in their home countries - particularly if these countries intervene in this conflict			1
earlier this month , a @entity248 who spent more than a year fighting in @entity97 was detained after three people were shot dead and another critically wounded outside a synagogue in @entity252			0
he was carrying a kalashnikov automatic rifle , a handgun , a 40 - second film in which he appears to claim responsibility for the shootings - as well as an @entity9 banner			2
carnage : @entity9 fighters devastated @entity3 , to the north of the country , on monday			2
pictured is a member of the @entity1 security forced gunned down by the militants strewn : uniforms though to belong to @entity1 soldiers were seen scattered on the road in @entity31 's second city - in this smartphone image from the conflict it can only be a matter of time before a @entity274 , indoctrinated in @entity97 by @entity9 , tries to launch a terror attack here			1
can anything be done to defeat this monstrous army ? certainly , we ca n’t rely on the @entity1 prime minister @entity238 , a dour , joyless figure who failed to win a majority in @entity31 ’s elections this april , and will not have a ruling coalition for months			0
his regime is not only at loggerheads with @entity31 ’s @entity285 - who see him as a puppet of @entity289 ’s @entity72 regime - but also with the ethnic @entity290 in the north of @entity31 , who enjoy all the trappings of independence and are in dispute with @entity238 over the country ’s oil wealth			2
the @entity290 ’ own ferocious 250,000 - strong peshmerga militia could probably make mincemeat of the jihadis , but they refuse to help unless @entity238 meets their demands on oil revenue			0
the result is that we are rapidly advancing to the point where @entity31 disintegrates into three separate states , with the @entity290 demanding full independence , @entity9 establishing its own territory in the north and west , and @entity31 ’s @entity72 population settling for the rest of the country			1
this would destabilise the whole region , compounding existing refugee problems and inflaming the @entity65 / @entity72 conflict			0
it is also what the @entity54 has desperately tried to stop happening for the past decade - but the cost in the blood of @entity200 , @entity15 and other countries ’ soldiers means no @entity99 leader will countenance sending troops back into @entity31 .			2

@entity9 ( @entity9 ) rules nation - sized *swathe* of land
