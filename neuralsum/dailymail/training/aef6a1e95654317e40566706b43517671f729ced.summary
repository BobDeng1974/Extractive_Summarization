the @entity1 ’s biggest banks were last night accused of being ‘ fundamentally corrupt ’ after selling worthless insurance to up to two million customers			2
the victims included vulnerable customers who had contacted their bank after their credit card had been lost or stolen			1
they were then duped into paying for insurance to protect themselves against fraudulent transactions made on their replacement card			1
claim : banks have been branded ‘ fundamentally corrupt ’ after selling worthless card insurance ( file photo ) but the insurance was useless as banks are legally obliged to refund fraudulent payments to customers anyway			1
typically the policies were sold when people contacted their banks for help over lost or stolen credit cards			1
yesterday the @entity24 watchdog announced 11 lenders and credit card firms , including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , would have to pay compensation for the latest scandal to shame the @entity34			1
other big names to have been caught out include @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
the @entity40 said 2million customers who took out ‘ card security ’ policies will start receiving letters later this month informing them that they could be line for a pay - out			1
in many cases customers will have been shelling out annual premiums of between £ 20 and £ 40 for insurance they did not need			0
they could be in line for hundreds of pounds in compensation			2
banks have already had to set aside more than £ 23billion to compensate customers duped into buying payment protection insurance – with @entity27 alone putting aside more than £ 11billion			1
attack : @entity58 mp @entity57 ( left ) said it ' sounds like fraud ' and @entity61 ( right ) hit out at ' dodgy products ' last night @entity63 expressed exasperation at the banks ’ latest transgressions			1
lord @entity61 , a former member of the @entity67 , said : ‘ you wonder when banks will learn their lessons and stop selling dodgy products			2
‘ this is yet another mis - selling scandal which underlines the conclusions we came to in the banking commission that the sales practices used by banks were fundamentally corrupt			2
’ there are striking similarities between the latest compensation package and a previous mis - selling scandal			2
two years ago it was revealed that up to 7million people were sold card protection policies manufactured by a @entity1 firm , @entity85 , by the major banks			1
a key , but entirely worthless part of these policies was they promised to provide insurance cover for customers if fraudulent transactions were made on their credit cards			1
@entity94 ( above right ) took out a ‘ @entity99 ’ policy on her @entity98 credit card in 2001 – but only discovered 12 years later that it has been a waste of money			2
mrs @entity94 , 54 , was a regular shopper at @entity98 , had used an @entity98 credit card since 1986 and did not expect to be duped into buying insurance which was worthless			2
but she was telephoned by a salesman in 2001 and coerced into taking out the policy , even though @entity105 automatically offers the fraud protection for free			0
mrs @entity94 , a widow from @entity107 , @entity108 , is not sure exactly how much she has paid for the policy over the years			0
but she said : ‘ it makes me angry that i ’ve paid out for something i did not need every three years for the last 12 years			0
’ @entity111 , a @entity112 member of the @entity113 , said : ‘ this is another awful example of banks mis - selling products			2
if the sector ever hopes to restore public trust , it needs to pull out all remaining skeletons from the cupboard			0
’ and @entity58 mp @entity57 said : ‘ this sounds like fraud			1
if this was any other walk of life they ’d all be heading straight to prison			1
it ’s very strange that banks have n’t even been fined for this			0
’ the insurance was provided by a little - known @entity133 firm called @entity134 , based in @entity135 , @entity136			0
but the policies were widely sold by the banks , which received money for each sale			1
now the @entity34 lenders face having to return hundreds of millions of pounds – plus 8 per cent interest – to customers			0
the compensation scheme has to be approved by customers and the @entity147 before it goes ahead			0
it will be available to anyone who bought @entity134 ’s policies between january 14 2005 and august 2013			0
given names such as @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity99 and @entity155 , the policies cost £ 25 a year on average but range up to £ 40			0
after receiving an initial letter informing them about the compensation scheme , customers will be sent a follow - up letter in april or may providing them with a voting form			0
if they back the scheme , then a @entity147 hearing will take place on july 9 to approve it			0
customers will then have seven months to fill out a form to request compensation , with the first pay - outs expected in the autumn			1
the @entity40 yesterday urged customers to vote for the scheme and said they will be provided with a dedicated helpline and website to assist them			0
but last night mp @entity111 raised concerns that victims could miss out			1
he said : ‘ i do not think a seven - month time limit for claims is long enough			0
’ yesterday @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity29 refused to apologise to customers and @entity30 declined to comment			1
a spokesman from @entity134 , which has escaped a fine , said the @entity40 had not found any fault with the company .			0

11 firms including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 to pay compensation
issue centres around ' card security ' policies for when stolen cards used
but banks have to refund fraudulent payments to theft victims anyway
mp @entity57 : ' in any other walk of life they *'d* go straight to prison '
