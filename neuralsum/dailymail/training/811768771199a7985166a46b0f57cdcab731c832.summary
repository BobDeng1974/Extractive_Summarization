by @entity0 burrowing tracks made by a centimetre - long prehistoric slug have pushed the earliest traces of animal life back 30 million years			1
the soft - bodied creature left its marks in a region of silty sediment in central @entity9 called the @entity10			0
rock dating has determined that the tracks are 585 million years old , 30 million years older than any previously known animal traces			1
signs of life : burrowing tracks made by a centimetre - long prehistoric slug have pushed the earliest traces of animal life back 30 million years unlike simpler life forms , true animals such as the slug are ‘ bilaterian ’ and have a front and back as well as an upper and lower side			1
the new findings suggest that bilaterian animals appeared between ice ages during the early @entity28 period			0
this pre-dates the ‘ cambrian explosion ’ when life diversified into a myriad different forms			0
scientists believe the slug - like creature grazed through sediments at the bottom of a shallow sea			0
the team , led by dr @entity40 from the @entity41 in @entity42 , wrote in the journal @entity44 : ‘ it appears as though a maximum interval of 50 million years exists between the earliest definitive evidence of sponges and the bilaterians found in the @entity10 , which implies that early animal evolution took place on a geologically rapid time scale once environmental conditions proved favourable for higher forms of life to colonise the ocean realm			2
’ prior to the new discovery the oldest evidence of bilaterian animal life , found in @entity59 , dated back 555 million years .			2

@entity61 burrowed through sediment in @entity9 585 million years *ago*
@entity65 known animal *remains* by 30 million years
