@entity0 is set to start making its own smartphone chips in a bid to move ahead of @entity3 in the smartphone wars			1

@entity0 , the world 's @entity16 smartphone maker , has been one of the @entity21 company 's top customers			2
@entity0 's latest handset , the @entity23			1
the firm is set to use its own chips in new handsets , it has been claimed previous leaks from @entity28 say the @entity29 , the codename believed to be assigned to the @entity31 , will feature a @entity32 ( 2560 x 1440 resolution ) 5.5inch display			1
it will also have an octa - core processor , @entity39 - @entity38 graphics processing unit , and a 16 - megapixel rear - facing camera			2
the handset is expected to be unveiled at @entity43 , a trade show in @entity45 , which takes place from 2 - 5 march			1
however , @entity8 's new @entity48 chip overheated during @entity0 's testing , @entity5 reported			1
the @entity14 company will use its own processors instead , @entity5 said			1

@entity0 has already used its own @entity80 processors in flagship devices such as the @entity82 to some extent , though analysts said @entity8 's @entity48 chips were more widely used			1
greater adoption of @entity80 chips in @entity0 smartphones would help boost sales for the struggling foundry business			0
' @entity0 will likely show off the new @entity11 phone in about a month and a half , so one would have to assume that the chips have been tested a fair amount in order for them to be used , ' said @entity97 analyst @entity96			0
@entity3 already designs its own chips - some of which are made by @entity0 successful deployment of @entity80 chips in flagship @entity0 smartphones will help burnish the company 's credentials as a chip designer and manufacturer , @entity96 said			0

the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity141			2
however , @entity142 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode ' you will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them , ' explained @entity122			0

instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with @entity0 devices , the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets , better			2
