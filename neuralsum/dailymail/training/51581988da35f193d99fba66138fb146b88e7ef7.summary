by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 20:30 est , 5 may 2012 embroiled in a fresh row : @entity2 @entity2 was embroiled in a fresh row over his local hunt yesterday after the @entity5 launched an unprecedented prosecution for unlawful foxhunting			1
the animal charity is already taking action against one member of the @entity12 hunt , which the prime minister has ridden with and which is popular with fellow members of the so - called @entity15 in the @entity16			1
but now it has laid fresh charges against the hunt and four of its members – provoking accusations that the charity ’s actions are ‘ politically motivated ’			1
the four accused of unlawfully hunting a fox with dogs in contravention of the @entity28 are @entity29 , 29 , who is a @entity30 of the hunt , @entity32 , 67 , @entity33 , 32 , and 48 - year - old @entity34 , a professional huntsman			1
the @entity36 revealed last august that mr @entity34 was already facing two counts of unlawfully hunting a fox			2
that case is due to be heard by magistrates later this year			2
the new charges have shocked the @entity12 ’s supporters , who include @entity43 , the former chief executive of @entity44 , her racehorse trainer husband @entity45 , and @entity47 presenter @entity45 , who has allowed the hunt to ride on his land			1
critics have questioned how the charity can afford such a move – pro-hunt campaigners believe the case could cost up to £ 1 million in legal fees – at a time when it is planning to make staff redundant			2
ms @entity29 said last night that all four defendants would deny the allegations when the case comes before magistrates in @entity60 , @entity61 , on june 1			2
she said : ‘ the rural community is amazed that the @entity5 has the staffing , the money and the time to pursue what is clearly a politically motivated campaign against a hunt which operates within @entity2 ’s community			1
’ the @entity5 last night confirmed it had laid charges against both the hunt and the four named individuals following a ‘ careful examination ’ of the evidence			1
but a spokeswoman declined to comment on claims that its actions had a political agenda			2
she said : ‘ while proceedings are active in this matter , we can not comment further			0
’ @entity83 supporters : @entity43 , left , and @entity45 , right , are both part of the @entity15 set allegations : professional huntsman @entity34 ( pictured ) is one of four accused of unlawfully hunting a fox with dogs in contravention of the @entity28 apart from his personal connections with the hunt , which he rode with in 2003 , mr @entity2 could find the legal action politically sensitive			1
the @entity93 has promised to hold a free vote in @entity95 on the hunting ban introduced by @entity97 in 2004			0
since the law came into force in february 2005 , there have been only five successful prosecutions involving more than 300 registered hunts in @entity103 and @entity104 , leading to eight individual convictions			0
seven other prosecutions have failed and a verdict is due in one further case involving the @entity110 and @entity111 hunt in @entity112 later this month			2
according to pro-hunt campaigners , the @entity5 ’s decision to step up its offensive suggests that there are internal tensions in the anti-hunting movement			0
the @entity119 had been taking the lead on prosecutions and the @entity5 appears to have been pressurised by its own ruling council to follow suit , following criticism that it was not adopting a sufficiently firm approach			0
steeped in tradition : mr @entity2 has spent time with the @entity128 ( some members pictured here at @entity131 in 1999 ) @entity5 council members include dr @entity133 , who was director of the @entity134 which donated £ 1 million to the @entity97 before the 1997 general election			1
the @entity5 is currently consulting on 130 redundancies because of a serious financial shortfall			0
a spokesman for the @entity140 said : ‘ the @entity5 ’s decision to bring such a huge prosecution is a blatant political attack on hunting and an abuse of the court system			0
‘ it is no accident that the @entity5 , which was a major part of the campaign to ban hunting , only brings private prosecutions against hunts in the prime minister ’s constituency			0
we believe that these allegations , like 99 per cent of those made about hunts , are groundless and we are confident that the prosecution will fail			0
’ in a newspaper article in 2003 , mr @entity2 recalled a day he spent with the @entity12 hunt			1
‘ nothing had prepared me for the sheer terror of a day ’s hunting , ’ he wrote			0
‘ i battled in vain to control my powerful steed and careered through trees and bushes – completely out of control			0
