a potentially dangerous wave of food fraud affecting everything from olive oil to tuna , spices and pomegranate juice has been exposed			1
extra virgin olive oil is being diluted with cheaper vegetable oil , while tea bags might be bulked up with lawn grass or fern leaves , according to @entity13 researchers			1
apparently healthy white tuna on a menu may actually be the less - expensive escolar , a fish that has been banned in many countries because of its links to food poisoning			1
food fraud : some manufacturers are selling cheap escolar - a fish that has been linked to a type of food poisoning - masquerading as tuna , a report warns there is evidence from @entity31 that manufacturers are secretly adding cheap pear and grape juice to pomegranate , which is highly sought after as a health drink			1
while spices such as black pepper , paprika and saffron may be bulked up with other plant material and coloured with industrial , and potentially dangerous , dyes			1
the warnings come from the @entity44 ( correct ) convention , an independent scientific body which sets quality standards for food and medicine			2
the organisation says many foods contain ingredients which consumers would not expect to have bought - akin to the recent scandal in @entity55 involving horse meat being found in beef burgers			1
according to the report , called the @entity59 , many of the added substances are less expensive and some are harmful			1
the situation mirrors warnings from @entity55 trading standards chiefs who say the current economic climate means manufacturers , retailers and restaurants may be more inclined to cut corners			2
@entity55 experts have found that honey , cheese , eggs , organic meat and produce , basmati rice , even fish and chips are not necessarily what they seem			0
just before christmas one @entity55 firm was fined more than £ 20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet			2
@entity85 claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and @entity89 cheese , when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper @entity92 cheese			1
' fillers ' : pomegranate juice , left , has been said to slow the spread of cancer , while olive oil , right , can help lower cholesterol - but both have appeared on a list of foods that often contain unexpected additives at the same time , pubs and restaurants are not immune to boasting of offering local quality food , when this actually means the nearest supermarket or wholesaler			1
one estimate suggests @entity55 families are wasting as much as £ 7billion a year paying over the odds for food that has been faked in some way			0
there are cases of imported beef from @entity118 cattle , which have a distinctive hump on their neck , being imported from @entity31 and sold in pubs as ‘ @entity55 ’			0
meat from cross-breed cattle containing @entity118 genes from @entity125 is cheaper than @entity55 beef , however critics point out that it can also be much tougher			0
vast quantities of cheap honey is being imported into @entity130 from @entity131 and used to bulk up other types in a scam that has become known as ‘ honey - laundering ’			2
in some cases honey is not honey at all , but rather corn syrup or just sugar			2
butcher shops and leading restaurants have been found selling conventional meat and produce as organic , along with a premium price			0
in the past , even @entity144 has been found selling farmed salmon as wild			0
but the fakery does not stop at salmon , for some fish and chip shops have been prosecuted for passing off @entity149 , which is farmed in the rivers of @entity152 ’s @entity151 , as battered cod. the fish sells for less than half the price of real cod in wholesale markets , however chip shop customers are being charged as if it is the real thing			0
director of policy at the @entity162 , @entity163 , warned that a squeeze on spending means his members find it increasingly difficult to stem the problem			0
mr @entity163 said : ‘ wherever there is a few pounds to be made someone will try to exploit it			0
‘ in times of recession , when people are looking for a bargain and going to different places , that is where you start to find more fraud introduced to food			0

healthy ingredients added to a list of foods *regularly* being bulked out with cheap - and sometimes harmful - substitutes by manufacturers
