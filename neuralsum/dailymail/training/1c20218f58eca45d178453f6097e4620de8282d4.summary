by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 5 august 2012 updated : 06:17 est , 6 august 2012 a @entity2 engineer is hoping 21st century technology will finally uncover the multimillion pound ' loot of @entity6 ' which has eluded generations of intrepid adventurers			1
@entity9 is heading up an archaeological expedition to try to uncover treasure buried on the @entity13 island of @entity14 worth an estimated £ 160million			1
the plunder could contain 113 gold religious statues , 200 chests of jewels , 273 swords with jewelled hilts , 1,000 diamonds , solid gold crowns , 150 chalices and hundreds of gold and silver bars			1
intrepid : a painting of a pirate ship landing at @entity29 in the @entity13			1
a £ 160million treasure trove containing gold , silver and jewels is believed to have been buried there by @entity2 seafarer captain @entity35 but finding it will be no easy task for mr @entity9 and his 15 strong team of researchers from the @entity40 and the @entity41			1
for nearly two centuries a string of famous explorers have led failed attempts to find the hidden stash on the uninhabited island , situated about 350 miles off the coast of @entity49			0
depression era @entity54 president @entity53 , swashbuckling @entity51 actor @entity50 and racing driver sir @entity52 all tried and failed to locate the treasure in the 20th century			2
@entity59 explorer , @entity57 spent nearly two decades living on the island attempting to hunt the treasure but returned home with just six gold coins			1
however , according to @entity64 mr @entity9 is hopeful that hi - tech machinery will be able to pinpoint the spot where @entity2 seafarer captain @entity35 buried the immensely valuable items in 1820			1
the team plan to use a small , unmanned helicopter , fitted with specialist cameras , to fly above the nine mile square island , to make a computer - generated 3d map of the landscape			1
a snakelike robot will be dragged across likely ' hotspots ' and use radar to detect voids and cavities up to a depth of 60ft			2
the information will be combined with the map to identify possible submerged caves			0
piracy : the treacherous captain @entity35 , right , was entrusted to transport the £ 100million treasure loot from modern - day @entity86 to @entity88 by viceroy @entity89 , left for nearly two centuries a string of famous explorers have led failed attempts to find the hidden stash on the uninhabited island , situated about 350 miles off the coast of @entity49 once possible spots have been selected , a ' keyhole ' drill will drive through up to 100ft of soil and a one - inch wide probe camera will be sent down to act as an underground treasure eye			1
the 10 - day expedition will also involve extensive archaeological , geological and ecological research and mr @entity9 is eager to point out that the quest is not solely for treasure , but also to carry out ecological , geological and archaeological research			1
mr @entity9 said : '' given the amount of treasure , it would have been too heavy to carry far from sea level and stories suggest the use of caves			0
we can also rule out where others have looked , dug up and detected – like on the beaches			0
' if it is there , it will be in a natural cave which was hidden by one of the many landslides that occur on the island			0
" it is not a case of following a map and ' x ' marking the spot			0
it is about using a bit of logic to establish the likelihood of some areas where it could be			0
" the nine - mile square island is the inspiration for @entity138 's famous novel @entity139 and the modern blockbuster dinosaur film @entity141			0
treasure hunter : engineer @entity9 from @entity143 in @entity144 is leading a mission to try and discover lost treasure on the island of @entity148 in the @entity13 such is the beauty and wealth of wildlife on the @entity13 paradise it is classified as a @entity153 status site and it took mr @entity9 around 18 months of negotiation with @entity49 authorities to get permission to lead the first mission there in 25 years			2
mr @entity9 runs an engineering company which provides specialist electronic exploration equipment			0
while the team are funding the expedition themselves , they hope a television company may help to cover the overheads			0
the quest will begin in november after the end of the rainy season and anything discovered will be passed on to the @entity49 government who will be expected to pay the salvage costs			0
the treasure had originally been accrued by the @entity175 in @entity6 , now the capital of @entity86 , but in the face of a revolt , the city ’s viceroy , @entity89 , asked captain @entity35 to ship the valuable goods to the @entity175 colony of @entity88			1
however , after leaving the port of @entity184 on the @entity185 , @entity35 killed the viceroy 's six men and took a new course to the @entity29			2
once there they buried the treasure , planning to return at a later date			2
however they were captured by a @entity175 warship and all the crew members bar @entity35 and his second in command were executed for piracy			2
in return for their lives the pair said they would show the @entity175 the location of the loot , but after landing back on the @entity14 they fled their captors			1
they are said to have been picked up by a passing ship a year later , but without the treasure .			0

treasure on @entity29 thought to contain gold religious statues as well as silver and jewels
loot was stolen from the @entity175 by @entity2 pirate who then buried it on @entity217
expedition also archaeological , geological and ecological goals
