lawyers for @entity2 bombing suspect @entity1 have asked to move his upcoming trial from @entity4 , proposing @entity5 , as the new location			1
in a motion filed in @entity9 late wednesday , @entity1 's public defenders said a survey of potential jurors in @entity4 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity5 suggests the nation 's capital would be a more suitable location for a trial			1
the lawyers , who cautioned that they still need more time to study the issue , said @entity4 residents were the ' most prejudiced ' on a number of critical measures , based on the may survey 's preliminary findings			1
more than 50 per cent of @entity4 respondents said they or someone they knew had participated in or attended last year 's marathon , at which three people were killed and more than 260 others were injured			2
about 37 per cent of @entity5 residents surveyed ' definitely ' believed @entity1 was guilty , 19 per cent said he deserved the death penalty and about 12 per cent said they or someone they knew had participated in or attended the marathon			1
prosecutors say @entity1 and his brother planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the 2013 marathon			2
his brother died following a shootout with police several days later			0
@entity1 has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges			2
his trial is expected to begin in november			0
among @entity4 respondents aware of the case , they said , nearly 58 per cent ' definitely ' believed @entity1 was guilty and 37 per cent believed that if convicted he deserved the death penalty @entity1 's lawyers said their motion has precedent : they noted that ' tremendous local impact and galvanizing community reaction ' prompted the trial of @entity62 bomber @entity61 to be transferred to @entity63 in 1996			1
the lawyers argue that the marathon bombings present an even greater impact to the @entity4 - area community			2
they pointed to the ' trauma ' of the four - day police search , capped by the dramatic final day , on which thousands of @entity4 - area residents were ordered to shelter in place until @entity1 was found			1
defense lawyers also noted the intense and sustained media coverage after the bombings and the ever - present ' @entity76 ' billboards , t - shirts and other paraphernalia			0
the request to change trial venues capped a busy day in the case			0
earlier , @entity83 district court judge @entity82 ruled that ' betrayal of the @entity83 ' should not be among the factors prosecutors cite when arguing whether @entity1 , who lived in the former @entity88 republic of @entity89 and in @entity90 before moving to the @entity83 , gets the death penalty if convicted			1
the judge said it was ' highly inappropriate ' for prosecutors to draw a distinction between a ' naturalized ' and a ' natural - born ' @entity83 citizen			0
@entity1 has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and his trial is expected to begin in november federal prosecutors have argued , in part , that @entity1 , 20 , deserves the death penalty because he betrayed his allegiance to the country that granted him asylum and later citizenship			1
@entity1 's attorneys have said the argument is unprecedented in death penalty cases			1
the judge on wednesday also denied a request by @entity1 's lawyers to allow them to meet with their client and his sisters in prison without federal agents present			0
instead , prosecutors agreed to have an @entity118 agent or other federal official not assigned to the case monitor the meetings , for security purposes			0
and the judge issued a stern warning to prosecutors about former or current members of their team speaking to the media			0
the warning came after the defense objected to interviews retired @entity118 agents gave around the april anniversary of the bombings			0
prosecutors said the interviews contained information already public .			0
