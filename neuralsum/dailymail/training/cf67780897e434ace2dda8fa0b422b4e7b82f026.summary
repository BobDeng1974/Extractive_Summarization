cutting it fine : over 90 % of doctors say @entity3 training is not enough to be able to carry out facelifts doctors and patients have overwhelmingly called for the introduction of new specialist training for cosmetic surgeons to remove cowboy practices from the industry			1
the latest survey , the results of which are exclusive to @entity15 , polled 500 clinicians and 2,000 women and was carried out to coincide with the @entity19 ’s largest plastic surgery conference , next month ’s @entity21 and @entity22 ( @entity20 )			1
hundreds of doctors said newly qualified consultants were not competent enough to perform specialist operations like boob jobs and facelifts – despite the fact there is currently no requirement for them to complete any further accredited training			1
only seven per cent – just one in 14 clinicians – said they believed @entity3 training alone was enough			1
about a third of doctors said clinicians should undergo at least three months ’ training before injecting cosmetic fillers and @entity36			1
the same number thought medics should have a minimum of three months ’ training to carry out laser treatment for acne , skin rejuvenation and hair removal			2
three - quarters of women would feel more confident having cosmetic surgery if doctors were forced to take a special qualification			2
patients thought training for fillers and @entity36 ought to last at least six months			0
the shock results are revealed days after @entity53 ( @entity54 ) released the first part of its review into training for non-surgical cosmetic procedures			0
officials have recommended that anyone injecting @entity36 or fillers has specialist qualifications			0
the proposals include undertaking minimum training hours , being taught to spot patients with mental health issues and shadowing clinicians – they will be allowed to inject patients only once deemed competent			2
in their hands : there is currently no requirement for newly qualified consultants to complete any further accredited training after that provided by the @entity3 the @entity15 ’s long - running @entity76 campaign calls for tougher regulation			1
we want a minimum standard for surgeons , proper regulation for those practising cosmetic surgery and an end to hard - sell tactics			0
overwhelmingly , doctors felt professional associations such as the @entity88 and the @entity89 should be responsible for training			2
many specialists will argue that the @entity54 proposals do n’t go far enough			0
for example , the @entity54 is not expected to recommend a mandatory register of accredited clinics			0
the organisation @entity96 is compiling a voluntary register of non-surgical cosmetic practitioners who are thoroughly vetted by doctors before being accredited – so consumers can have confidence in selecting a clinic .			0
