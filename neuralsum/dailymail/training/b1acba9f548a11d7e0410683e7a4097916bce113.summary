the ‘ consultancy charges ’ are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker , rather than the boss , will pick up the bill			1
the report , from the influential @entity22 , warns these charges can be ‘ extremely high ’ and have ‘ the potential to cause serious consumer detriment			1
’ dame @entity26 , the committee ’s @entity27 chairman , said : ‘ the plethora of costs and charges that can be applied to pension pots are not only confusing			2
‘ they can seriously impact on an individual ’s retirement income			0
’ she is ‘ particularly concerned ’ about consultancy charges , including those paid by current workers as well as workers who have left the company but were members of its pension scheme			1
dame @entity26 said : ‘ neither can be justified			0
’ it gives the example of two workers called ‘ @entity49 ’ and ‘ @entity50 ’ who both contribute the same amount of money into their pension , but miss @entity56 pays a lower charge			2
after 43 years paying into their pension pots , her pension is worth £ 78,000 , but his pension is worth only £ 63,000 after paying an extra £ 15,000 in fees			0
the report warned : ‘ we are very concerned by the high level of such charges quoted in some advisers ’ literature and the potential for this to reduce significantly the size of scheme members ’ pension post , and ultimately their income in retirement			1
’ last night , the @entity79 said it has already begun an investigation into the controversial issue of consultancy charges			1
@entity83 , the @entity84 , wrote to the @entity85 last year saying he is ‘ increasingly concerned ’ about them			0
he warned : ‘ they should only be deducted from an individual ’s [ pension ] pot where there is a tangible benefit to that individual			0
’ the timing is urgent because millions of workers are currently being signed up into a company pension scheme for the first time in their life			0
' consultancy charges ' are made when a boss takes advice about signing up his workers to a pension scheme - but the worker , rather than the boss , will pick up the bill under new rules , introduced in october , all workers who do not currently have a company pension are being ‘ auto - enrolled ’ by their boss into a retirement scheme			1
a @entity79 spokesman said : ‘ we have been gathering evidence on consultancy charging and will announce a decision in due course			0
’ one pension expert , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ consultancy charges could just wipe out the whole point of saving			1
‘ it will put lots of people off			0
they will get a letter after their first year of saving into a pension and think : ‘ where has all my money gone ? ’ dr @entity130 , an independent pensions expert and former number 10 adviser , said workers must be protected from ‘ unfair and inappropriate charges			1
’ she said : ‘ at the moment , it is perfectly permissible for unqualified , unregulated advisers to charge auto - enrolled workers for advice that is only given to the employer			2
‘ anyone giving advice to the workers themselves would need to be fully qualified and regulated , but because the advice is going to the employer , the regulatory protections are not being applied			0
‘ that is despite the fact that the workers ’ pension fund is paying for the advice that the employer receives			2
this is clearly wrong and should be banned immediately			0
’ @entity150 , head of pensions research at the advisers @entity152 , said : ‘ i am particularly concerned about lower paid , frequent job changers who could see a substantial portion of their retirement savings lost as a result of consultancy charging			2
