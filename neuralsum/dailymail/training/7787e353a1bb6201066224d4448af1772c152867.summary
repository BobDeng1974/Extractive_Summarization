by @entity0 created 2:12 pm on 23rd february 2012 a schoolgirl who suffers from a rare liver disorder must eat nearly twice her bodyweight in raw cornflour every year just to stay alive			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is one of just a handful of children in the @entity10 who suffer from glycogen storage disease			1
the disorder means the 12 - year - old 's body is unable to release glucose , which provides energy , from her liver			2
@entity19 : @entity5 , 12 , with some of the boxes of cornflour she must guzzle constantly just to stop her from slipping into a coma and dying there are no medicines that can tackle the rare condition so the youngster has to eat 250g of cornflour every day - equivalent to more than 91kg per year , nearly twice her weight			1
the starch in the cornflour creates a slow release of energy throughout the day , stopping @entity5 from slipping into a coma or suffering liver damage			1
in order to consume the dry powder , @entity5 must mix it with water and gulp down the gloopy mixture			1
her mother @entity40 , 48 , even has to set an alarm for a daily 2am dose so @entity5 ’s body can continue to create energy throughout the night			1
doctors diagnosed @entity5 with the rare disorder when , aged just three years old , she was rushed to @entity47 in terrible pain			1
' @entity50 connoisseur ' : @entity5 with her mother @entity40 , 48 , who is a voluntary worker with the @entity51 examining the youngster , specialists found her liver had enlarged by about 6cm and suggested that she might be suffering from glycogen storage disease			1
experts at @entity58 , @entity56 confirmed the diagnosis of the condition which affects about only one in every three million people			0
for three years she had to be fed through a nasal gastric tube until her body was strong enough to just have the cornflour			0
@entity5 , who has an older brother , @entity66 , 17 , who does not have the illness - takes her cornflour drink at 8am , 3pm , 8pm and then her dose in the night			2
although she is now able to go to sleepovers with her friends , she still has to get up at 2am to have her glucose hit			0
she said : ' some of the cornflour doses make me gag but i found the one that i like the best and just stick to that			0
' i am just used to having to have it now and my friends are used to what i have to do			0
' it sometimes gets a bit annoying but i guess i just get on with it			0
' @entity5 's mother , a voluntary worker with the @entity51 , said : ' @entity5 is amazing - she just gets on with it every day and does not ever complain			2
' i hand her the drink , she knocks it back and then just carries on doing whatever she is doing at the time			0
' she has even become a cornflour connoisseur and can tell which ones she likes and which ones make her feel ill. ' it ’s just amazing how much of it she has to have every day but it means that she can live quite a normal life			0
' @entity5 faces the prospect of having to eat cornflour for the rest of her life although her family hope developments in gene therapy might one day offer a cure			2
until then , they are able to claim back £ 22 per month from the @entity51 because the cornflour is deemed to be a treatment for her .			0
