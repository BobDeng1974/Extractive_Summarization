by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:47 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 08:23 est , 26 august 2012 it is an audacious gamble that could determine who the next @entity4 president will be			1
in a last - ditch attempt to reconnect with the @entity4 people , @entity14 will parade his family on stage on the first day of the @entity10 presidential convention in @entity11 tomorrow – all 140 of them			1
the four - day convention is the biggest event of the former @entity21 governor ’s stuttering bid to become the 45th president of the @entity4			1
@entity23 begins : @entity14 ( centre ) addresses supporters while standing with sons ( from left ) @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , wife @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 after winning the @entity34 primary on 10 january 2012 four hundred and fifty days into @entity14 ’s campaign , and with just ten weeks to go until the election , the @entity10 ’s presumptive nomination is struggling to overcome the negative impact of his various gaffes , his apparently contradictory positions on several key issues including healthcare and abortion , and questions about his business career and wealth			1
most polls have @entity48 very slightly ahead , but in real terms the contest is neck and neck			1
the convention , which is likely to focus on economic issues and will be watched by a tv audience of more than 20 million people , will be the make - or - break moment for @entity14 because it will mark the point at which the majority of @entity4 will start to take notice of the presidential campaign			1
conventions usually have a significant impact on a candidate ’s prospects , and with six out of ten @entity4 saying they find it impossible to relate to his impassioned defence of traditional values , the former @entity67 bishop is pinning his hopes on his family			1
he calculates that by portraying ‘ @entity74 ’ as a typically dysfunctional @entity4 family , he will win over voters			1
the family : @entity78 governor @entity77 with his wife @entity79 and children ( left to right ) @entity14 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 against the backdrop of a tasteful wood - panelled set – originally built for @entity86 – the 65 - year - old billionaire will introduce relatives who range from his sister @entity82 ( who was obliged by a failed marriage to take up an acting career ) to a brother who was excommunicated for his sexual sins by the @entity67 church			1
‘ the @entity101 are believing @entity102 but they are neither saints nor are they exempt from the influences of the world around them , ’ one of his cousins , @entity97 , observes in his new biography , @entity14 : an inside look at the man and his politics			1
behind the good looks , @entity81 confides , the family ’s attempts to adjust to ‘ pressures and temptations ’ make the confessions that will be aired on stage worthy of any reality show			1
married to @entity30 , the blonde granddaughter of a @entity118 coalminer , @entity14 has five sons and 18 grandchildren , which historians say may make him the most fecund @entity124 candidate ever			1
@entity28 , 42 , is @entity14 ’s oldest son			1
like his father , he is an investment banker and so will help emphasise his father ’s economic credentials			1
@entity28 and his wife @entity128 have six children , and his four brothers also have families , but three of them ‘ have wrestled with fertility issues , ’ says @entity81 , and resorted to @entity135 treatment , seemingly inconsistent with their father ’s moral views			1
showing their support : @entity14 's siblings @entity81 and @entity82 are set to appear at the convention ‘ they even employed a fairly compensated surrogate mother , ’ claims @entity81			1
he declined to identify which sons but notes that surrogacy is ‘ strongly discouraged ’ by the @entity67 church , to which all the family belong			2
@entity148 , 41 , the second son , is a property developer			2
he and his wife @entity149 have four children			2
the couple irked @entity14 ’s fellow republicans last year when they attended a @entity153 dressed as @entity154 and her husband @entity155			2
@entity32 , 37 , is considering a political career			2
the son and his wife @entity158 have five children			2
after serving in @entity160 as a mormon missionary , he became a male model in @entity163 , but @entity81 says he became disenchanted by the ‘ meat market decadence ’			2
@entity4 audiences love a dramatic narrative			2
@entity167 , 34 , is a doctor			2
the son and his wife @entity168 have one child			2
@entity31 is said to be the most ‘ un-romneylike ’ of the brothers			2
though he has agreed to appear with his family at the convention , he has no interest in politics			1
@entity175 , 31 , is the youngest son and a former advertising executive			2
he and wife @entity177 have two children , one of whom , @entity179 , is playing a major role in his grandfather ’s attempt to soften his image			0
all to play for : @entity10 presidential candidate @entity14 speaks as vice presidential running mate rep. @entity185 listens during a campaign rally he has repeatedly given interviews about how the four - year - old once fashioned his hair into a mohawk using egg whites and glue			1
‘ man , that was one bad hair day , ’ he says			0
@entity195 , 77 , is @entity14 ’s elder sister			0
she had eight children by her late husband , federal prosecutor @entity197 , and the convention will hear she has lived a self - effacing life , devoting herself to the care of her youngest son , who has @entity203 ’s syndrome			1
@entity83 has grappled with other difficult issues			0
@entity14 opposes abortion but she is expected to tell the audience he will not ‘ force ’ his beliefs on women because her sister - in - law ( @entity197 ’s sister ) died during a botched backstreet termination			0
@entity212 , @entity14 ’s sister , is expected to reduce the house to tears with a deeply personal story			0
now 74 , the immaculately preserved bottle blonde dreamed of following her mother , @entity79 , into a career as an actress			0
but she put aside her ambitions to start a family when , aged 20 , she married a nephew of @entity223 , the head prophet of the @entity67 church			0
after more than two decades of marriage , and four children , the couple had an acrimonious divorce			0
‘ family members told me @entity82 had a terrible divorce , ’ said @entity81			0
‘ it destroyed her life			0
her husband had been a terrific philanderer			0
’ aged 42 , she decided to ‘ resume ’ her acting career , although roles have been few			0
in @entity11 she is expected to admit to another skeleton in the @entity14 family closet : she once campaigned for two of @entity241 ’s best - known @entity240 politicians			0
however , she now says she is a committed @entity10			1
tight : there 's not much in it for the race to be president between @entity14 and the current premier @entity48 ‘ i ’ll be at the convention for six or seven days , ’ she told @entity248			1
‘ i have a big story to tell			0
’ @entity252 , @entity14 ’s 71 - year - old brother , is expected to deliver a frank testimonial about ‘ sin and redemption ’ , says a party insider			0
@entity81 shared his brother ’s passion for politics , yearning to follow in the footsteps of their father , @entity260 , a millionaire car tycoon and governor of @entity78			0
but he failed to become @entity78 ’s chief law officer			0
he was ‘ sealed for eternity ’ in a mormon temple ceremony to a tv presenter , @entity267			0
after bringing up six children – five of their own and hers from a previous marriage – they divorced in 1992			0
later , he was ‘ disfellowshipped ’ from the @entity67 church when he married @entity272 , a tv host who , in what @entity81 ’s book calls a ‘ religious transgression ’ , was pregnant with his child			0
he and @entity272 divorced in 2009			0
in july last year , he married a widow , @entity277			0
first wife , @entity278 , now 68 , will attend the convention , with @entity277 and all seven of his children ( including two by @entity272 ) and their seven grandchildren			1
it should all make for dramatic viewing			0
will it prove to be car - crash tv , dashing @entity14 ’s presidential ambitions ? or a masterstroke that sets his campaign alight ?			1

@entity10 convention , starting tomorrow , is the defining moment of the campaign
