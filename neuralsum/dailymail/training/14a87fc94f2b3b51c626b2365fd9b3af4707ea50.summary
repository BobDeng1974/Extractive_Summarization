many of us will have suffered the disappointment that comes with discovering than an online date is not all they seemed			1
however some reactions can be more extreme than others			0
in a recent study it was revealed that the number one fear that women have about dating online is that they will meet a serial killer			1
for men , it is that their date will be fat			1
this shocking statistic prompted the men behind the dating website @entity18 to conduct a social experiment to see if men really are as shallow as the study claimed			1
@entity25 is a dating app where strangers who are in close proximity can ' like ' a profile by swiping right			1
if the person in the profile swipes right too then the couple are able to chat via the app. @entity23 , 24 , whose profile contains images of her petite frame in a bikini , had no problem securing five dates for the experiment			2
@entity23 worked with dating website @entity49 to test her dates ' reaction when she turned up to their date several stone heavier than they anticipated in her @entity25 profile images , @entity23 appeared slender showing off her svelte figure in a bikini @entity23 's original tinder profile managed to fetch her five dates who were all keen to leave once they saw her in her fat suit however , @entity23 looked completely different when she turned up to meet her potential suitors			1
ahead of the date , with the help of make - up and prosthetics , @entity23 transformed her slender body into that of an overweight woman complete with bingo wings and a double chin			2
@entity23 then waited for her dates at the agreed location surrounded by secret cameras ready to video the reactions of her dates			2
@entity23 agreed to take part in the experiment after a study found that men 's worst fear about online dating is that their date will turn out to be fat while some of the men attempted to hide their disappointment and engage in polite conversation at first several were n't shy when it came to pointing out @entity23 's flaws			1
every single man featured in the video remarked on @entity23 's appearance , ranging from the polite ' you look a little different than your photo ' to one brazen man telling her she appeared more voluptuous and even asking if she was pregnant			0
one man asks @entity23 how long it has been since she had her picture taken and @entity23 remarks that it 's ' not super old ' and had been taken six months ago			0
the cheeky actress plays on the men 's obvious confusion and when they remark on how different she appears she reacts with sarcastic remarks			1
@entity23 underwent a huge transformation using make - up and prothestics she tells one date that he is the first person to point out how different she looks and says to another that her new lipstick might be the reason for her altered appearance			0
certain men take her deception a little more personally than others with one particularly upset date telling @entity23 that ' he does n't appreciate people lying to ' him before leaving			2
in total four out of the five men come up with a reason for them to leave the date			2
out of the five dates that @entity23 invited only one ( pictured ) lasted the date with others making excuses to leave such as being married or needing the toilet they range from the reasonable , with one man saying that he ' ca n't do this ' because it was n't what he expected , to the sneaky - with another date hot footing it to the bathroom and never returning , ending in the completely absurd with one man claiming that he overlooked that fact that he is actually married			0
despite having several dates lined up @entity23 only manages to keep one at her table and he is the only one who discovers @entity23 's true identity			0
when the 24 - year - old confesses that the entire date has been part of a social experiment he seems somewhat relieved if a little shocked			1
the polite date says ' well i try to be nice ' before adding ' sucks to be them ' when finding out that the four other men had abandoned @entity23			0
now see what happens when the roles are reversed after the shocking results of their first experiment the men behind @entity18 could n't resist trying it again with the genders swapped			1
and the results could n't be more different operating under the same structure as the original set - up , this time @entity161 , 28 would take on the role of the fat date			0
as with @entity23 , when @entity161 's dates first meat him they are a little taken a back pointing out that he appears rather different from his profile			0
however , unlike the men who met @entity23 the women who meet @entity161 seem happy to go along with the date			1
one of his dates tells @entity161 that she ' loves all men ' and she ' does n't discriminate as it 's like having a smorgasbord			2
' only one of the women seems genuinely upset by @entity161 's deception refusing to believe that @entity161 could be the same man she had been talking to on @entity25 , he explains his different appearance with the fact that his pictures are two to three years old			1
unlike @entity23 , whose dates could n't be keener to leave the uncomfortable situation , the women who meet @entity161 are happy to stay for a chat and @entity161 even manages to secure several second dates with one of the girls asking him to a farmers market			0
one particularly eager lady is so keen on @entity161 she ends their date with a kiss			0

men 's *biggest* online dating fear is that their date turns out to be fat
women are most worried about meeting a serial killer
dating site conducted a secret social experiment using @entity25 matches
a slim woman organised five dates and then attended them wearing a fat suit
four out of five men left within minutes of meeting her
they then tried the experiment with the genders switched
