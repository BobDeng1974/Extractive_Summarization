by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 04:29 est , 18 november 2013 @entity1 , the grand old lady of letters who has died at 94 , lived long enough to turn against practically all the strongly held convictions of her youth			1
an avid communist in her younger days , she later rejected not just communism but feminism and political correctness , too			1
still , though , she retained some shocking political thoughts			1
days after the attack on the @entity11 in 2001 , she was belittling the act of terrorism , saying : ‘ it was neither as terrible nor as extraordinary as the @entity15 think			1
’ some years earlier , @entity16 were in her sights			1
in her 1962 feminist classic novel , @entity18 , she attacked their uselessness , particularly their inability to satisfy their wives sexually			1
but , despite her scorn , it was to @entity25 that she came , from colonial @entity26 — now @entity27 — more than 60 years ago , settling into a gloriously ramshackle , tall , slim house in @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
@entity31 : writer @entity1 , pictured in 2006 , has died peacefully aged 94 at her home in @entity30 she derided literary prizes , but scooped them all including , in 2007 , the @entity34			1
at 88 , she was the oldest woman ever to win it and only the 11th woman to receive the award			1
her triumph came as no surprise to a woman formidably confident in her own intellectual abilities			1
while the @entity43 praised @entity1 for her ‘ scepticism , fire and visionary power , ’ when informed about winning the prize , the writer responded : ‘ oh @entity48 !			1
i could n’t care less			1
’ but she later said : ‘ i ’ve won all the prizes in @entity50 , every bloody one			1
so i ’m delighted to win them all			1
it ’s a royal flush			1
’ born @entity1 in 1919 in @entity54 ( now @entity54 ) , she moved as a child with her @entity57 family to @entity26			2
her father , who lost a leg in @entity60 , ran a rundown maize farm , where he was looked after by an increasingly desperate wife , a former nurse , whom the young @entity1 was at odds with from earliest childhood			2
her mother was refined , cold and unemotional , always beautifully dressed and more interested in perfectly polished silver and whether the piano was in tune than in @entity1 and her brother			2
‘ i have sacrificed myself to my children , ’ she would complain in their hearing			2
still , it was her mother who helped to forge @entity1 ’s extraordinary literary career , shipping huge parcels of books from @entity25 for her daughter			2
recognition : @entity1 who was born in @entity54 - now @entity54 - was awarded the @entity34 aged 88 in 2007			1
she was the oldest woman ever to win it ‘ i was never educated , you see , ’ said @entity1 , who left convent school at 14			1
‘ without the books , i would have come to grief			2
’ determined to escape what she described as a stifling , provincial , expat world , she entered a doomed marriage to @entity89 , a civil servant ten years her senior			2
she was only 19 and it was the eve of @entity91 ‘ everyone got married , ’ she explained			2
a fter less than five years and with two children , @entity94 and @entity95 , the marriage came to an end			2
rather than subject the boy and girl to the cool neglect she had suffered from her own mother , she decided it would be preferable if she abandoned them , leaving their father to bring them up			2
in due course , in 1944 , she married a @entity108 internee , @entity107 , and had another child			2
that marriage , too , failed after five years			2
in 1949 , she fled to @entity30 with her youngest son			1
honor : @entity1 shows off her @entity34			1
she responded to the accolade by saying ' i could n't care less ' @entity1 later said : ‘ i ’m very proud of myself that i had the guts to do it			2
i ’ve always said that if i had n’t left that life , the intolerable boredom of colonial circles , i ’d have cracked up and become an alcoholic or had a mental breakdown			2
’ such callousness was hard to forgive			2
her older son , @entity94 , later told her : ‘ i understand why you left , but it does n’t mean i forgive you for it			0
’ just as the @entity126 began , @entity1 joined the @entity127 , but later came to see that it had been a mistake			0
‘ we believed this rubbish , absolutely			0
but i think there is something about politics that makes people mad , really			0
’ whatever the shortcomings of her political and private life , she was undeniably a literary titan			0
controversial : @entity1 's novel @entity18 has been hailed as a classic feminist text the grass is singing , her 1950 debut novel about the racism of white colonials in @entity143 , was a sensation			1
a tide of novels , poems , operas , autobiographies and short stories followed			0
over 60 years she published almost 60 books			0
they were not all rapturously received			0
after she won the @entity34 , the acerbic @entity15 literary critic @entity154 said : ‘ although ms @entity1 at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities , i find her work for the past 15 years quite unreadable			1
fourth - rate science fiction			0
’ those early , admirable qualities were most in evidence in her controversial novel @entity18			1
explaining its genesis , she said : ‘ i had been listening to women talk about women ’s issues and about men			0
suddenly when i wrote down these private conversations , people were astounded			0
it was as though what women said did n’t exist until it was written			0
’ the sexually graphic book tells the story of @entity179 , a deeply frustrated woman at the dawn of the sexual revolution and women ’s liberation movement			0
it is unremitting in its detail			0
it deals candidly with menstruation , the female orgasm and men ’s sexual shortcomings			0
@entity1 called @entity25 a country ‘ full of men who are little boys and homosexuals and half - homosexuals ’			1
she made it clear that she thought that public boarding schools had a lot to answer for			0
the @entity197 was widely venerated by feminists and declared ‘ the @entity199 of the women ’s movement ’ , though @entity1 refused to become a feminist poster girl			1
she said : ‘ what i really ca n’t stand about the feminist revolution is that it produced some of the smuggest , most unself - critical people the world has ever seen			1
’ indeed , in the introduction for a 1993 reissue of @entity18 , she said it was not a ‘ trumpet for women ’s liberation ’			1
‘ i think a lot of romanticising has gone on with the women ’s movement , ’ she said a few years ago			0
‘ whatever type of behaviour women are coming up with , it ’s claimed as a victory for feminism — does n’t matter how bad it is			0
we do n’t seem to go in very much for self - criticism			0
’ and she told the @entity223 book festival that modern men were ‘ cowed ’ by women			0
‘ they ca n’t fight back , ’ she said			0
‘ and it ’s time they did			0
’ return : @entity1 's novel was reissued in 1993 - a move called a ' trumpet for women 's liberation ' @entity1 wrote her later works from a messy , chaotic home in @entity29 , @entity30 , with worn - out carpets — more student digs than elegant literary salon			1
her black and white cat @entity238 ( named after a character in @entity240 and @entity242 ’s light opera @entity243 ) would keep her company			0
so fond was she of her various cats that she wrote three books about them			0
she was desperate to escape categorisation as a particular kind of writer			0
@entity1 noted that over the years she had been given ‘ every conceivable label ’ — starting off as a writer about the colour bar , then a communist , then a feminist , then a mystic			1
the mystic label came about because of her interest in later life in @entity260 , a form of @entity263 mysticism			0
she saw herself as none of these things , but as a storyteller			0
‘ just being a writer was the thing , ’ she told this newspaper when she was in her 70s			0
‘ for me , it still is			0
