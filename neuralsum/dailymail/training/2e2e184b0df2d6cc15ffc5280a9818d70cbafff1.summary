by @entity0 last updated at 9:18 am on 5th january 2012 estate agents will wax lyrical about even the most unassuming property – but this time , they really do have something to sing about			2
the country estate which inspired the classic hymn @entity6 is up for sale			1
and the generations of children who have sung about ‘ the purple - headed mountain ’ and ‘ the river running by ’ have actually been giving the rather spectacular particulars of @entity14			2
magnificent : the ivy - clad manor house in the @entity17 near @entity18 was the inspiration for the well - loved children 's hymn stunning natural beauty : the ' purple - headed mountains ' and ' river running by ' refer to the beauty of the @entity17 creatures great and small : horses graze beside the river and drink from its calm waters @entity31 is believed to have written the lyrics while she was a guest at the 16th century manor , nestled in the @entity17 in @entity35			1
the ‘ purple - headed mountain ’ in one verse of the 1848 hymn is thought to refer to the nearby @entity36 and @entity38 peaks , while ‘ the river running by ’ in the next line is the @entity43 which winds along the valley floor close to the estate ’s boundary			2
and the six acres of land it sits in would have offered plenty of space for the @entity52 poet to observe ‘ each little flower that opens ’ and ‘ each little bird that sings ’			1
these days , however , the £ 2.25million seven - bedroom manor is simply advertised as having ‘ stunning views ’ , along with rather more modern additions of a high - ceilinged cinema room , ornamental raised @entity60 bath and remote - controlled mood lighting			2
the rooms in the manor house where mrs @entity64 stayed are bright and airy @entity64 ( @entity65 ) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns			1
she was born in @entity68 in 1818 , and spent much of her later life in @entity70 and @entity71 with her husband , @entity72 , who became archbishop of @entity74 and @entity75			2
mrs @entity64 was a keen supporter of the @entity76 , and in 1848 published hymns for little children , which include three of the most popular hymns in the @entity81 language : @entity82 and there is a @entity84			0
the book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to @entity52 charities			1
she died in 1895 and is buried in @entity70			0
the estate agent ’s description of the former boutique hotel insists that ‘ much of its character still remains ’ but it ‘ also embodies great comfort and ease of living ’ in the village of @entity98 , near @entity18			0
still , when mrs @entity64 wrote her famous verses she could never have imagined the home ’s selling points would one day include its proximity to top golf courses , @entity105 - starred restaurants and the @entity106			0
it is also said to have an ‘ exquisite interior ’ and an ‘ abundance of reception space ’ , and comes with @entity112 décor , a detached coach house and an orchard			0
with some poetic licence of their own , the vendor even describes how ‘ chandeliers reflect in gleaming white marble floors ’ and boasts of ‘ polished black granite work surfaces and gold inlay ’			0
but mrs @entity64 , who also wrote once in @entity121 , would no doubt be comforted to know that the modernised house contains traditional wood panelling ‘ in the style of @entity126 ’ and boasts ornate fireplaces			0
the poet , who died in 1895 at the age of 77 , was married to the @entity130 archbishop of @entity74 , and included @entity6 in her bestselling hymns for @entity132			1
the tome proved so popular that 69 editions were published in the 50 years after it was written			0
@entity52 poet mrs @entity64 , who wrote the hymn , stayed at the @entity139 manor house in 1848 it has been claimed that the hymn was also inspired by countryside near @entity143 in @entity144 , and the poetry of @entity146			1
the words in turn influenced the works of @entity150 , who used the ‘ all creatures great and small ’ line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the @entity157			0
a spokesman for @entity160 estate agent @entity159 , which is marketing the property , said of its link to the famous hymn : ‘ not many houses have such a selling point			0
‘ but it is easy to see why mrs @entity64 was so inspired			1
the scenery surrounding the house is magnificent			1

@entity52 poet was inspired by magnificent scenery surrounding @entity35 mansion
