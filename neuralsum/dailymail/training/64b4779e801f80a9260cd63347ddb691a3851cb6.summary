' i was in the early pregnancy unit and no - one from paediatrics came to talk to me about my other options			1
' but i 'd just had a 20 week scan and everything was perfect and finding out it was a boy made it very hard to accept a termination			1
' the doctor said " you have to have a termination because there 's nothing we can do "			1
' she added : ' i understand doctors have to tell you the worst case scenario and be blunt , but no two people on this @entity74 are exactly the same and doctors did n't even give @entity17 a chance			1
' when he came back in and @entity13 and i had talked we told him i would n't be going into theatre and the doctor looked at his watch and rolled his eyes at me , as if i was wasting time			2

doctors there warned their son could be brain damaged and would probably die at birth because his lungs would not be developed			2
however @entity17 defied the odds and came out kicking and wriggling on december 6 , 2013 - and even let out a small ' squeak ' before being rushed to an incubator			1
he suffered with chronic lung disease and jaundice - which he quickly recovered from after his lungs and organs developed			2

preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes happens in expectant mothers who are less than 37 weeks pregnant			0
most women will go into spontaneous labour within 24 hours of rupturing their membranes			0
but six per cent of women do not go into labour within 96 hours			0
the earlier into the pregnancy the rupture occurs , the less likely it is that the onset of labour will be within a specified time period			0
the condition affects six to 19 per cent of preterm pregnancies and occurs in two per cent of all pregnancies			0
the condition is associated with 40 per cent of preterm deliveries and can lead to high morbidity and mortality			0
risk factors for the condition include smoking , previous preterm delivery , vaginal bleeding and lower genital tract infection			0
an expectant mother may describe feeling a ' popping sensation ' of a ' gush ' with continuous watery liquid draining			0
a woman will be taken into hospital immediately and admitted in many cases for the at least 48 hours			0
in most cases delivery should be considered at 34 weeks			0
it is recommended that women diagnosed with @entity189 should not exceed 96 hours after their membrane has ruptured			0
the risk of maternal and foetal infection increases the longer the time between membrane rupture and the onset of labour			0
source : @entity197 mrs @entity46 , who runs a children 's boutique with her 36 - year - old husband , added : ' we have a happy outcome but i worry that other mothers could have had an abortion when their babies might have survived			1
' i was given such a bleak outlook that i kept thinking " he 's not supposed to be healthy " and was waiting for something to happen , but it never did			2
' she claims she was forced to @entity211 her options rather than being given any by medics - and now hopes her story will be seen by other pregnant women doing the same thing			0
@entity218 and @entity219 's chief executive @entity217 said staff were working with mrs @entity46 to resolve her concerns about her treatment			0
he said : ' from june 2013 , while @entity10 was with us , it 's our opinion that she received high quality clinical care and was provided with information about the range of options available to her in her circumstances , as well as having these options discussed in detail			0
' the team who cared for her pulled out all stops to keep both her and her child safe throughout her high - risk pregnancy and following this , we transferred her to a more specialist hospital so that she received the best possible care for her condition			2
' we are delighted that over a year on , both mother and son are healthy and well			2
' as a @entity219 , we strive to learn from all the feedback we receive from our patients to continually improve our service			0
' we have only very recently learned of her concerns as no complaints were raised earlier - had they been , we would have been in touch with her directly and looked into what had taken place			0
' we are now working closely with her and her family to understand what happened in detail			0

@entity7 ' mother 's waters broke just 20 weeks into the pregnancy
doctors declared pregnancy was non-viable and advised she have abortion
but @entity17 's parents defied doctors ' advice and @entity17 was born at 25 weeks
weighed just 1.4lb - less than a bag of sugar - and had lung problems
he is now thriving and his parents have been assured he is healthy
they now fear other parents are *wrongly* being told to have a termination
