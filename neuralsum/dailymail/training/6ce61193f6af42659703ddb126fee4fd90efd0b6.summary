by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 09:42 est , 26 may 2012 @entity3 police have arrested pope @entity5 's personal butler following an investigation into the leaking of sensitive church documents , it emerged today			1
in a scenes worthy of a @entity12 thriller , the butler identified as @entity13 , 46 , was held by gendarmes after a special commission of three top senior cardinals had been appointed by a furious @entity5 to identify the source of the leaks which have caused severe embarrassment			1
@entity13 , who has been at the @entity5 's side for six years , is one of the @entity23 born pontiff 's closest members of his inner circle which totals just four lay people and four nuns and he is always at his side - he is so close that he and the nuns who look after him are described as the ' pontiff 's family '			1
the @entity5 's butler , @entity13 ( bottom @entity32 ) has been at the @entity5 's ( right ) side for six years			1
he has been arrested on suspicion of leaking internal documents it is believed that @entity13 , who is known by the nickname @entity36 ( little @entity37 ) was held as he arrived for work at the @entity40 apartments in the @entity41 behind @entity42 's and tonight he was being held in custody - the first time in years the @entity3 jail had been used			1
@entity3 spokesman father @entity45 said a man had been detained with ' documents in his possession ' adding that he was not supposed to have them and he went on to describe him as ' a lay person and not a member of the clergy '			0
the arrest of @entity13 comes just days after author @entity55 published a book on the leaked documents called @entity58 ( @entity59 )			2
the @entity3 had condemned the book as ' criminal ' and the printing of the documents were a violation of the @entity5 's privacy it said			1
the @entity3 said it has arrested a man caught in possession of secret documents in a bid to crack down on the source of the leak scandal @entity55 hit back and said that the files were not private and were documents between states and he added they had been given to him by people who work inside the @entity3 and in a reference to the @entity77 , he said the sources wanted to ' get the moneylenders out of the temple '			0
today 's arrest came just a month after @entity5 turned detective and appointed a special commission to investigate the series of damning and embarrassing leaks of sensitive @entity87 documents from the @entity3 as it still tries to recover from the priest sex abuse scandal			1
dozens of documents including private letters to the @entity5 have found themselves into the hands of the @entity94 media in what has been dubbed , unsurprisingly , @entity13			1
the documents show how contracts were awarded to favoured companies and individuals and also highlight allegations of internal power struggles with the @entity3 's bank known as the @entity103			1
dozens of documents including private letters to the @entity5 , right , have found themselves into the hands of the @entity94 media in what has been dubbed @entity13 by coincidence on thursday the head of the bank , @entity109 , who is already under investigation for money laundering resigned after a vote of no confidence and initially there were rumours that he was the person responsible for the leak of documents			2
the scandal began in january with the publication of leaked letters from the former deputy governor of the @entity125 archbishop @entity123 , in which he pleaded not to be transferred after he had exposed what he said was corruption over the awarding of contracts			0
archbishop @entity123 was deputy governor from 2009 until last year when he was moved to @entity131 to be papal nuncio in the @entity133			0
he had written to the @entity5 protesting the fact adding that it would bring an end to his efforts to ' clean up ' the @entity3			0
earlier this year there was even a report leaked which claimed a plot to assassinate pope @entity5 had been uncovered although this was dismissed as " absurd " by @entity141 who threatened to take legal action against the tv station that screened the documents			2
the @entity5 was said to be ' shocked and saddened ' at the constant leaks and it led to him appointing the cardinal commission which worked with the @entity3 gendarmes and lead to the arrest			2
@entity150 , an expert on @entity3 affairs with newspaper @entity152 , believes @entity13 , pictured , has been made a scapegoat @entity3 prosecutor @entity154 was questioning @entity13 and the news was dominating @entity94 media with many describing the arrest as an ' earthquake within the @entity159 ' although some questioned if he was perhaps being made a scapegoat			0
sources said that sensitive @entity3 documents had been recovered from father of three @entity13 's home inside the @entity3			2
but @entity150 , an expert on @entity3 affairs with newspaper @entity152 , was sceptical of his involvement and said : ' i know @entity13			0
he is a nice guy but i do n't think he would be behind this			0
i think he may have been imprudent and taken the odd document home but he is not the main person			0
' if you ask me he has been made a scapegoat just to satisfy the media			0
the documents found at his house were from the @entity5 's personal correspondence but a lot of the leaked documents have come from the secretary of state 's office and he would not have had access to those			1
' this is all part of a plot to discredit @entity5 and @entity187 ( @entity186 ) @entity185 ( secretary of state ) and i think it has been ordered by senior figures from within the @entity191 who may have exploited @entity13 but i personally do n't think he is the driving force behind @entity13			2
' a @entity3 spokesman added that the @entity3 did have cells but said he had ' no idea when they were last used ' .			0

documents also show how contracts were awarded to favoured people
@entity13 has been at the @entity5 's side for six years
@entity5 appointed senior cardinals to investigate the leaks
