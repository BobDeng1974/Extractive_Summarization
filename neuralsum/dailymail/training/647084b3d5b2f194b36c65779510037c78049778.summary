by @entity0 it proved to be a miserable @entity2 for @entity3 , with the @entity5 defender part of the @entity7 squad which bombed out in the group stage at @entity9			1
but the 24 - year - old has already put the @entity12 disappointment behind him by spending time in the off - season with girlfriend @entity14			0
on a personal level the centre - back , proved faultless in @entity9 as he played just one match in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity22 , by which stage @entity7 were already eliminated			0
but in travelling with the @entity7 squad , @entity3 is allowed extra time off before returning for @entity5 's pre-season which began on monday .			2

@entity5 defender *enjoys* holiday after @entity7 's *disastrous* @entity2
@entity3 played just once at @entity9 2014
@entity30 *due* back for pre-season training ahead of new *campaign*
