scientists have developed a male birth control pill which they claim is 99 per cent effective and has few side effects			1
the pill , derived from an @entity6 shrub , apparently allows men to produce sperm that can not get women pregnant			1
it is made from the gendarussa plant , which has long been used by tribesmen on the island of @entity14 to prevent their wives from conceiving			1
scientists have developed a pill , derived from an @entity6 shrub , which they claim will render sperm incapable of getting a woman pregnant - with a 99 per cent efficacy rate professor @entity22 , of @entity23 , developed the pill after hearing rumours of these effects , and bringing the gendarussa plant to his lab for study in 1985			1
he has carried out 30 years of research , isolating the active ingredient , putting it into a tablet form , and carrying out clinical trials to prove its contraceptive effects , @entity29 reports			1
he says the plant ’s active ingredient disrupts three key enzymes in sperm , weakening them and making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process			1
this would not interfere with the quantity or quality of sperm produced because it only targets the enzymes , he told the @entity48			2
professor @entity22 is currently working on the dosage , but hopes to create a formula meaning men would take the pill an hour before sex			0
small clinical trials , the largest studying 350 men , found it to be 99 per cent effective			1
they also found male fertility returned to normal within a month of taking the pill			1
however some men gained weight on the pill , professor @entity22 told the @entity29			0
the gendarussa plant , is a small branched shrub found in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , the @entity68 and @entity6			1
in 1985 , @entity6 researchers began to look into its effect as a contraceptive			2
they heard anecdotal evidence that men belonging to a certain tribe in @entity14 were using it as a contraceptive , @entity73 reports			2
the tribesmen would boil the leaves in water and then drink the water 30 minutes before having sex			0
it is said to have been a ' godsend ' for the tribesmen			0
in their culture , they were not allowed to get their wives pregnant until after they had fully paid off their dowries			0
professor @entity22 , of @entity23 , has been studying the contraceptive effects of gendarussa for nearly three decades			2
he says the plant ’s active ingredient disrupts three key enzymes in sperm , making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process			1
and at least one participant saw an increase in two enzymes that indicate poor heart or liver functioning , although it was unclear whether this was due to the pill or another health issue , he said			2
but overall , researchers found no obvious side effects , and ' certainly none that rival those associated with female hormone - based contraceptive pills '			1
hormonal birth control has been linked with a raised risk of heart attack , strokes and blood clots , as well as nausea and bleeding			1
however previous research has found one of the biggest barriers to a male birth control pill comes from the attitudes of women – who do n’t trust their partners with the responsibility of taking it			1
in 2011 , a survey by @entity130 found that half of women would not rely on a male pill as contraception – because they did not trust their partners to remember to take it			0
now , the @entity6 medicines regulatory body wants a bigger trial to verify the findings			0
indeed , such a trial would need to be carried out for the pill to be marketed in @entity141 or the @entity142 but global pharmaceutical companies are already showing an interest in the pill			0
professor @entity22 said he has already turned down an offer of billions of funding from a major @entity142 pharmaceutical firm , who wanted to buy his patent , which is owned by the @entity23			0
now , he says the pill will hit the shelves by 2016 , although regulations mean it may take up to a decade longer to be sold in @entity141 and the @entity142 the news comes after the @entity156 , a not - for - profit organisation based in the @entity142 , announced its trials of a new birth control injection were proving promising			1
the injection , called @entity160 , is injected into the vas deferens - the tube that sperm passes through on the way to the penis			0
the gel acts to block sperm , thus preventing pregnancy			0
developers hope it will be cheap , reversible and long - lasting , and hope to make it available within three years			0
similarly , last year @entity172 researchers said they had made a scientific breakthrough that could make a male contraceptive pill reality			2
their technique worked like a temporary vasectomy , stopping sperm leaving the body during sex			0
this works by blocking two proteins involved in the ejaculation process			0
the pill works by weakening enzymes in sperm , making them unable to penetrate the eggs during the fertilization process			2

@entity189 said to weakens enzymes in sperm so a woman ca *n't* become pregnant
small clinical trials have shown it is 99 *%* effective and has few side effects
male fertility returned to normal within month of taking the pill , say *doctors*
pills is made from the gendarussa plant , an @entity6 shrub
for years , tribesmen in @entity14 have boiled the plant in *tea* as birth control
