from the outside , elegant @entity0 appears exactly as it was when @entity2 first built its grand houses in the 1820s – exclusive , noble , expansive – and , famously the @entity6 home of the @entity8 aristocracy			1
but behind the opulent facades , a quiet social revolution has been taking place : most of the square ’s grand mansions have now been bought by foreign multi-millionaires , including some whose wealth is so outrageously vast they are listed as billionaires			1
using offshore companies to avoid scrutiny , and stamp duty , the international super-rich have been discreetly acquiring the capital ’s trophy assets – making this , in the process , the richest residential square in the country			0
expensive address : most of @entity0 in @entity6 has now been bought by foreign multi-millionaires , including some whose wealth is so outrageously vast they are listed as billionaires the buyers are typical of the brash new money flooding into @entity6 , which hosts 72 billionaires – ten per cent of the world ’s total – not to mention a growing number of super-rich worth £ 100 million or more			1
and they are paying hugely inflated prices for houses , ranging from £ 7 million for a mere apartment up to an estimated £ 60 million – for ‘ homes ’ which in many cases are rarely occupied			1
last week it was reported that @entity6 has become the millionaire capital of the world per head of population , ahead of @entity46 and @entity47 , based on analysis by the @entity50 wealth consultancy			2
the owners of @entity0 symbolise this new wealth			1
the majority are resident but non-domiciled which means they do not have to pay tax on their overseas income			0
for this privilege they pay an annual fee of £ 50,000 – petty cash for an oligarch or tycoon			0
despite prices now at £ 3,000 per sq ft , @entity6 remains the most attractive place for the foreign rich to park their money and educate their children			1
and they reside in a tiny enclave of which @entity0 is the epicentre			2
dominated by embassies and consulates , there are fewer than 30 homes , but at least five of the owners are billionaires			2
only three are owned by @entity8 , and few are occupied full time			0
at night it has a ghostly feel			0
here we introduce some of the more notable members of the residents ’ association …			0
