the thought of putting on weight fills most a-listers with dread - but that has n't stopped @entity6 artist @entity5 , 20 , from digitally fattening them up			1
he then sells the altered images to men who like larger ladies - and is happy to take commissions that focus on a specific celebrity			0
among the famous women fattened up at the request of the men he describes as ' chubby chasers ' are @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and even @entity20 's princess @entity19			2
' men are always writing to me asking if i can make their celebrities crushes look a bit fatter , ' he explains			1
' @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity18 are some of the most popular requests i get			2
' mr @entity5 , who is in a relationship with a ' plump ' woman himself , says that he , like his clients , thinks the famous faces look better with extra weight			1
' these women look much better when they 're overweight , ' he says			2
' i prefer @entity19 [ of @entity20 fame ] when she 's a fat princess - that 's a real woman right there			0
' first go : mr @entity5 's first star was @entity47 ( left )			1
since then he has fattened up @entity48 among others popular : mr @entity5 says @entity50 is ' much sexier ' with chunky thighs and a bulging belly now the 20 - year - old is hoping to become internationally famous for his @entity55 work , all while showing the world that flab is better than abs. ' look at my pictures and you will see that big is beautiful , ' says mr @entity5 , who says plump is always more attractive than stick thin			1
' for example , @entity50 is much sexier with chunky thighs and a bulging belly that hangs around her waist			0
' a computer technician by day , mr @entity5 has been amusing himself with @entity55 art since his school days			1
but he only began making money from his hobby after his altered image of an obese @entity47 went viral after being published on @entity72 last year			1
who 's that girl ? @entity16 piles on the pounds in a photo altered by artist @entity5 time consuming : each image takes up to two days to complete			1
pictured : @entity78 gets a makeover @entity80 : mr @entity5 is even asked to manipulate @entity82 characters such as @entity84 's @entity83 @entity5 ( pictured ) hopes to make his photo - shopping a full time career in the future ' i love @entity47 but she would look much more sexy with a few extra pounds , ' says mr @entity5			1
' so for my own pleasure , i manipulated her first album cover to make her look a bit chubby			1
' i uploaded it online and soon , men were messaging me with requests to photoshop other stars to look flabby			2
' in less than a year , mr @entity5 has received over 200 requests from men across the world , all of whom like to fantasise about celebrities with a bit of podge			1
each work takes around two days - with four to six hours spent on each in total - to complete			0
' usually each manipulation takes a few days but there have been times when i 've spent a whole week on just one , ' he explains			0
part of the reason for the lengthy production time is that clients have very specific ideas about how they want the final result to look			0
' i know my clients want their fat celebs to look as realistic as possible , ' he explains			0
' some even have an idea of how much they want them to weigh			0
i do n't stop until they look perfectly plump			0
' when i get requests to make @entity82 characters - like @entity19 and @entity83 - look fat , i have to make a digital drawing on a pen tablet			2
that can take a long time too			0
' now mr @entity5 says he hopes to turn his part - time job into a full - time career			1
' i would love to dedicate my life to this			0
' the big women are beautiful but there are many people today who do n't agree with that			2
however when they see my gorgeous , fat celebrities , i think they might realise how wrong they are			0
