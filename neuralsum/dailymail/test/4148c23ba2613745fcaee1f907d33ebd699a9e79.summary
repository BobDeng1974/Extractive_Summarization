the relationship between the @entity1 and @entity2 — never great at the best of times — has deteriorated further with the ridiculous clash of fixtures on saturday			1
both organisations blame each other for their respective rights holders , @entity9 and the @entity10 , scheduling the marquee @entity11 vs @entity13 league match against the @entity14 semi-final between @entity16 and @entity17			1
the @entity14 game attracted a peak audience of 6.9 million , over treble the 2m rating for the @entity2 game on @entity9			1
but both viewing figures would have been higher had they not coincided			1
@entity17 's @entity14 semi-final victory over @entity16 on saturday clashed with a top @entity2 fixture with star quality including @entity28 and @entity29 on show , @entity13 's visit to @entity11 took viewers away from the game at @entity33 , bringing the @entity2 and @entity1 into another dispute the @entity1 say that the dates of the semi-final were known at the start of the season , while the @entity2 point to the @entity9 fixtures for the weekend having been set last february — a month before the @entity10 announced their semi-final schedule			1
to add to the muddle — with the tv armchair fan the big loser — the @entity2 purposely chose to broadcast fixtures involving top - four clubs on semi-final days			2
they do this because the @entity14 takes precedence and the league postponement means @entity9 often then have the bonus of a blockbuster live televised midweek game close to the end of the season that could have a bearing on the title race			2
but @entity11 and @entity13 both being knocked out of the @entity14 prevented that happening this season			0
hazard celebrates the only goal of the game in the @entity2 showdown , but viewers missed out @entity63 , who has had weight problems since joining @entity13 , enjoyed one of his better games against @entity11 in a season when he rates his own performances as c minus			1
coincidentally , hard - line @entity13 boss @entity70 has banned his players from stopping at the permanent fast food van on the road leading to @entity13 ’s @entity75 training base			1
the van has been a favourite pit stop for @entity13 stars , including @entity79 , down the years			0
but having no choice but to lay off their tempting bacon sarnies could be the making of @entity63 , it seems			2
@entity63 was in impressive form at @entity86 , and he might owe his form to a change in diet @entity92 's football - style celebration of his two wickets in the first @entity94 added some impetus to @entity97 ’s bowling team , with @entity92 looking more like the next @entity94 captain with every game			1
but not everyone was impressed , including former @entity102 manager @entity101 , who is following @entity97 in the @entity103 and who tweeted his disapproval , adding that he was ‘ old school ’			0
but @entity101 is canny enough that when he sold his cricket agency @entity108 , he kept hold of the wealth management business that still looks after a good proportion of the @entity97 side			0
@entity92 celebrates the wicket of @entity114 , but his exuberance has been criticised by @entity101 @entity116 is the elephant in the room , even at @entity97 ’s sleepy @entity119 on the day after the first test			2
@entity121 could be seen in a long conversation with @entity124 ’s @entity123			0
it transpired this was a clear - the - air chat between the sensitive pair after @entity121 was upset with @entity123 for being so positive about @entity116 ’s @entity130 stint with the programme			1
quite why this should annoy @entity121 is hard to understand			0
@entity121 seems unable to get past the continuing rumours about an @entity97 return for @entity116 @entity116 has expressed a desire to play test cricket again , and is trying to prove himself at @entity137 clarke back for more you might think the @entity140 ’s preposterous president , @entity139 , would be keeping his head down after making such a fool of himself at the 2015 @entity144 launch by haranguing guest speaker @entity145 and almanack editor @entity146			2
instead he wants ‘ sale ’ , as he addresses your sports agenda columnist in an email , to make clear that he missed the @entity94 in @entity149 not because of anything to do with his doomed five - year deal for @entity152 matches on the island with serial fraudster @entity154 , but because he was attending @entity156 board meetings in @entity157			0
@entity139 attends an @entity160 meeting in @entity157 , which was his reason for not being at the test in @entity149 ironically , @entity139 ’s replacement as @entity140 representative in @entity149 was @entity165 chairman @entity164 , who loathes @entity139			0
one thing has remained reassuringly constant during all the turbulence of @entity97 cricket abroad over the last 16 years — veteran team operations manager @entity169 always has the best suntan			0
however , colleagues point out how hard former @entity172 captain @entity169 works when he ’s not sunning himself around the pool .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 fall out over clash
@entity10 and @entity9 viewing figures both suffered with games on at same time
@entity63 might have been *helped* by @entity70 's fast - food rules
@entity92 's celebrations come in for criticism , while @entity121 is still *worrying* about @entity116 's media *coverage*
