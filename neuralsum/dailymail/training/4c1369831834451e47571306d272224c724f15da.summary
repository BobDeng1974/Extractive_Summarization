by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:48 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 20 october 2013 one of the men filmed destroying a 20 - million - year - old rock formation in a @entity6 state park only last month sued another driver claiming his back was severely injured in a 2009 chain - reaction accident			1
seen in the video toppling the rock formation in @entity12 , @entity13 is able to force it off it 's wobbly perch before high - fiving son @entity16 - all on a back he claims was severely injured			1
the footage , which the @entity19 and friend @entity20 posted to their @entity22 pages , shows @entity13 and son @entity16 enthusiastically celebrating the destruction of the rock formation			1
the elder @entity16 even jokingly flexes his muscles , proud of his achievement			1
the @entity6 man has had to ' endure great pain and suffering , disability , impairment , loss of joy of life , ' the suit says , according to an attorney who spoke to @entity56			0
the lawsuit also called the accident ' debilitating , ' the station noted			1
@entity59 , the attorney representing the woman being sued , told the station that @entity13 was one of many motorists rear - ended , and that no one involved complained of pain or went to a hospital			1
after seeing the ridiculous video , the attorney feels the case has no merit			2
' he 's climbing over other rocks , then he lines up , gets leverage and pushes that big old rock several times before he finally pushes it over , ' the confused attorney told the station			2
' then he turns and twists and high fives and yucks it up and flexes his muscles he just does n't look like a terribly disabled person to me , ' mr @entity59 adds			2
in his client 's defense , attorney @entity81 told @entity56 that @entity13 is suing for payment of prior medical bills stemming from the accident and that medical bills may continue into the future			1
he does admit , though , that a jusry trial involving the tape might not go particularly well			0
@entity93 officials have said that the three men could face felony charges for destroying the formation , which has been there for 20 million years			0
speaking to the @entity98 , mr @entity20 said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week			1
' i ’ve got over 100 death threats on the internet already , ' said mr @entity20			1
' i ’ve got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me because i made the decision that lives are more important than this rock staying here a few more hours , ' he added			2
despite attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people across the globe , mr @entity20 continued to defend his group 's actions			1
' i think we made the right decision , but probably the wrong method , ' he explained to the @entity98			0
' we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we made , and we ’re open to whatever that means from the state , from the @entity124 ’ office , etc. ' caught on camera : @entity13 is filmed pushing the ' loose ' rock in @entity12 destroyed : the massive rock , which had been in place for 20 million years , crashes to the ground beneath celebration : @entity13 and @entity16 high - five while the cameraman , @entity20 , laughs and whoops for joy a criminal investigation is now underway in the incident , which occurred on october 11 , spokesman @entity134 told the @entity98			1
' it is not only wrong , but there will be consequences , ' he said			0
' this is highly , highly inappropriate			0
this is not what you do at state parks			0
it ’s disturbing and upsetting			0
' deputy @entity147 attorney @entity146 said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet reached his office			0
if it does , he will consider whether to bring charges			0
he said they could face anywhere from a class b misdemeanor ( up to six months in prison ) to a second - degree felony ( one to 15 years in prison ) depending on how much the formation is valued , the @entity98 reported			2
he added : ' some things ca n’t be replaced , like photographs in a family album , but they have great sentimental value			0
' the rock formations at @entity12 in @entity6 are thousands of years old , formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock proud : the men said they were ' saving lives ' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child showing off : @entity13 , a boy scout leader , flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch but the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby			1
on the video , @entity20 says : ' some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and @entity13 saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way			1
so it ’s all about saving lives here at @entity12			1
' @entity16 said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it , it was loose			1
' i put my hand on a rock and it moved , ' he said			2
' while we were sitting right there we thought , " man if this rock falls it ’ll kill them "			0
' i did n’t have to push hard			0
' but when they left , he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action			0
but the men said they had only seen one in the park that day			0
@entity12 is more than 3,600 acres of desert with hoodoo rock formations in @entity6 ' civic service ' : @entity16 , left , watched as @entity13 , right , pushed the rock down on october 11 stunning : the rock formation at @entity12 , pictured , was 20 million years old still , they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently			1
' glad we did it , wish we would n’t have done it , ' @entity13 said			2
@entity20 added : ' we 're extremely sorry for our actions			2
there was no in way shape or form any intent to go out there and cause any harm to our natural resources			0
' @entity229 added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over			0
