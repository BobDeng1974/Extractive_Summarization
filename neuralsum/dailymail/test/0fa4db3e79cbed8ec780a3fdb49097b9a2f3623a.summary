whether it is through sir @entity1 , @entity2 or @entity3 , @entity5 's classics king @entity4 believes the time has come for @entity7 to break their duck in one of cycling 's monuments			1
with the two major cobbled classics - the @entity14 and @entity15 - looming large over the next two weekends , it is time to see the early results of sir @entity19 's move to put more emphasis on the @entity21 in his second five - year plan for @entity7			1
with @entity24 electing to sign off his @entity7 career with an appearance at @entity15 on april 12 , the races are bound to be a big part of the team 's season whatever the outcome			2
@entity32 @entity1 competes during the the @entity34 one day cycling race on march 29 the shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season , with @entity3 defending his title at @entity41 , @entity7 's third victory in the @entity44 race , while @entity2 last week won @entity45 - a key warm - up for this weekend 's @entity14			1
@entity4 , whose record of nine @entity21 wins puts him in a tie for third all - time , likes what he sees from @entity7 as the big races approach			1
' right now they 're looking really good , ' @entity4 said			0
' they 've been very impressive in the semi-classics			0
can they finish it off by winning a big one ? ' @entity7 's focus on the @entity58 up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics , while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics			2
but the development of @entity3 and @entity2 gives @entity7 two in - house contenders , while @entity24 raised eyebrows with his ninth - placed finish in @entity15 last year and he vowed to return			1
@entity68 could also be another @entity32 option for the team			0
@entity3 ( 3rd from front ) rides in the @entity34 one - day cycling race on march 29 injuries to classics specialists @entity75 ( @entity76 ) and @entity77 ( @entity78 ) - although the latter may return in time for @entity15 - add to the impression that @entity7 's best chance may be now			1
' without @entity75 , without @entity77 , it 's going to be a more open race , ' said @entity4 , who will commentate on both the @entity14 and @entity15 for @entity84			1
' there 's going to be eight - 10 guys saying they can win and @entity7 have three of them			0
@entity2 is certainly in there , @entity3 is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash ( in the first @entity21 , @entity87 on march 22 ) but can come back , and then of course there is @entity24			1
' of the three , @entity24 is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win @entity15 , but @entity4 is not counting the @entity99 winner out , saying a @entity21 win to add to his @entity14 and world time trial success would elevate @entity24 to ' another level '			1
' if you look at the way he 's performing at the moment , for me , it 's not as good as i would like him to be in the recent races , but you ca n't go to @entity15 with only one card to play , ' @entity4 said			2
@entity2 celebrates placing third in the @entity44 cycling classic @entity111 - @entity34 ' with @entity2 and @entity3 as well , you play all of those cards and the rest look after them			2
if you can get to the final 10 - 12km and @entity24 is still there , that is where he can go on the attack			0
' to get to that point , @entity7 will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as ' the @entity124 '			0
the brutal cobbled stretches , which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems , create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible			0
although @entity4 never won the @entity14 , finishing second in 1984 , he was victorious in @entity15 twice , 1984 and 1986 , and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him			2
' when i first went there i had a horrendous time - i was very nervous on the cobbles and i was n't able to ride them well , ' he said			0
' i slowly developed and i was able to manage to ride them , but even when i got to the point of being a @entity146 - @entity15 favourite it 's still very nervous times			0
' it 's a horrible race to ride , but a great race to win			0

@entity7 have never won one of cycling 's five @entity21 races
the @entity14 takes place next weekend with @entity3 and @entity2 contenders fro @entity7
@entity4 has backed them to finally break their duck
