sir @entity0 will now know for sure whether @entity1 is bulking up too much after appearing to give the world no 1 a squeeze during monday 's practice round at @entity5			1
after @entity1 was on the cover of @entity7 and admitted he was ' obsessed with the gym ' , @entity0 , a three - time @entity0 winner , voiced his concern that the 25 - year - old was spending too much time on the weights			1
@entity0 last week told the @entity13 : ' throwing 200lb and 300lb weights around is not going to be good for your golf swing			2
the heaviest weight i would ever lift was my body weight			0
you can play some pretty good golf when you have just got some decent shoulders on you and a strong neck and a strong pair of hands			2
' sir @entity0 puts a hand on @entity1 's shoulder during monday 's practice round ahead of the masters @entity1 and three - time masters champion @entity0 greeted each other with a handshake at @entity5 @entity1 's fitness programme does n't seem to be doing him too much harm			1
he goes into the year 's first major as the bookies ' favourite and looking to become just the sixth player in history to complete the career grand slam			1
he shook @entity0 's hand on monday and the @entity42 , wearing a green jacket @entity1 would love to have in his collection , gave him a squeeze on the shoulder			1
as expected , @entity1 drew a huge crowd as patrons piled in to the famous @entity50 course and @entity52 amateur @entity51 had a taste of things to come as he practised with him			2
the patrons were also keen to get close to @entity1 as masters week began with the monday practice @entity1 , preparing to tee off on the fourth , is bidding to win a fifth major and complete a career grand slam @entity61 made sure he put in a bit of work in the huge bunkers at the @entity50 venue meanwhile , just 27 per cent of @entity1 's fellow professionals think he will complete the career grand slam by winning the masters this week			1
but the good news for the 25 - year - old is that he is far more popular than defending champion @entity71 , who can not rely on too much support if he gets into a fight at @entity5			0
those were among the results gleaned by an @entity77 survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - who anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics			0
asked if @entity1 would be wearing a green jacket on sunday , 28 players said yes , 72 said no and three abstained			0
@entity1 will have caddie @entity88 on the bag to help him plot his way round the stunning course the @entity92 had @entity52 amateur @entity51 for company during monday 's practice and @entity1 congratulated @entity51 after he chipped in at the second ... save them for thursday @entity51 asked which player they would not help in a fight in the car park , @entity71 got double the number of responses ( 22.6 per cent ) of second - place finisher @entity104 ( 11 per cent )			1
@entity105 was third and @entity107 fourth			0
other topics covered in the survey included slow play and recreational drugs - @entity112 was judged in need of the first one - shot penalty in 20 years on the @entity115 , narrowly ahead of @entity116 , while 40 players felt the @entity115 should stop testing for marijuana			0
and on the subject of @entity120 , only seven per cent thought he would not win another major before the start of the season			0
however , after @entity120 missed the cut in @entity126 and withdrew from his next event after 11 holes , the numbers became 50/50			0
@entity1 walks with @entity52 amateur @entity51 on the 12th fairway during a practice round for the masters @entity1 putts on the 12th green as he puts the final touches on his preparations for the upcoming masters			2

@entity1 admitted recently he was ' obsessed with the gym '
