by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 smiled when it was pointed out that his @entity5 strike rate is akin to @entity6 ’s			1
‘ say that to me again in 50 games ’ time , ’ he replied			1
the goals keep flying in but the @entity10 has a nice line in self - deprecation			1
@entity6 played 80 times for his country and scored 48			2
only sir @entity15 has more @entity5 goals			1
@entity2 has scored three in five			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity2 talk about @entity5 and @entity19 dream : @entity2 remains grounded despite his meteoric rise from non-league to international football sharp shooter : @entity2 took his @entity5 tally to three from five games with a strike against @entity28 he has broken into international football relatively late , with a debut last year at 31 , but the instinct for goal remains unchanged and the fairytale rise goes on — from non-league to the @entity35 , a move to his beloved @entity19 and the @entity37 less than a week away			1
‘ you ’ve got to dream , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ you ’ve got to believe , that ’s what i ’ve done all my life			2
i ’m rolling with it at the minute			2
it seems like it ’s not stopping			2
who knows where it will end ? ‘ you can get carried away with people who say it ’s a completely different world			2
you do believe that when you ’re in @entity51 and @entity52 but if you believe in yourself , it ’s not			2
‘ you have to adapt to each level and it improves you when you ’re in better teams			2
that ’s what ’s happened to me over the years			2
every team i ’ve played in has just got better and better			2
it ’s become a lot easier			0
‘ the goal does n’t move			1
it ’s the same shape whatever level you ’re at and the ball ’s the same size and shape			0
it ’s something we ’ve practised all our lives			0
there are still aspects i want to improve and do better			0
‘ it ’s getting to know your players as well			0
this is the first time i ’ve played with some of the lads but we ’re doing ok			0
’ take a bow : the former @entity76 striker scored on his debut for @entity5 against @entity78 twice as nice : @entity2 celebrates celebrates his second @entity5 goal - against @entity80 @entity2 seems entirely at ease in this company			1
it is not simply the goal rate			0
his touch is good and he is strong in the air , giving @entity5 a different @entity87 of all , he is aware of others around him			1
he may not be the quickest but he reads the game and his movement is intelligent			0
he looks lean and fit and , importantly for the mood and balance of @entity95 ’s squad , he is content to play a supporting role to the likes of @entity98 and @entity99 — although his goals may yet prove equally important in @entity101			1
‘ it ’s not about if i start against @entity103 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it ’s about the plan that @entity95 ’s got			0
we ’re all behind it and whether that ’s starting or coming on as sub , we ’re all behind the manager			0
‘ i ’m desperate to do well			0
i ’m a striker and any chance i get i want to score			1
it ’s the best feeling in the world to score for your country			0
’ there are no pretensions			0
@entity2 moves in superstar circles with the world ’s most famous footballers but he is grounded by a decade in the lower leagues with @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity76			1
red alert ! the 32 - year - old has completed a £ 4m move back to his childhood club @entity19 just days before leaving for training camp in @entity133 , @entity2 was finalising his £ 4million transfer from @entity76 to @entity19 , his hometown club , where he signed as a schoolboy before being released at @entity136 asked to start up front against @entity28 in the @entity138 on wednesday , he went out and smashed in @entity5 ’s second goal in a 2 - 2 draw			1
‘ it ’s been a life - changing couple of weeks , ’ admitted @entity2 , 32			1
‘ it ’s been a life - changing couple of years			1
i ’m trying to enjoy every second of it			0
‘ walking into @entity145 ( @entity19 ’s training ground ) , i could n’t recognise it			1
i had n’t been back since i trained there as a kid			0
‘ i hope it does give hope			0
it ’s about working hard and believing in yourself			0
anything you can do to improve your lifestyle and your own game , you must do it			0
