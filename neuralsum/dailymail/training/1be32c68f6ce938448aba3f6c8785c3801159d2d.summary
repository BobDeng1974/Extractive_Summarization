as first days go , it was not what @entity2 had expected			1
as he walked through the doors of @entity5 , the man who had signed him , @entity6 , had long since headed in the opposite direction			0
indeed , the @entity10 international needed to seek out his new boss to make his introductions			0
on top of that , the versatile half - back was also having to deal with some significant changes in his family life , as he made the move from @entity21 to @entity22 with wife @entity23 and month - old baby son @entity24			1
@entity2 has adapted quickly to live at @entity25 after his move south from @entity27 ‘ add into that a few sleepless nights and it was maybe not the easiest starts to my time at @entity25 as there was a lot going on , ’ admitted a smiling @entity2 , who has hardly had time to catch his breath since his move south from @entity27 over the summer			1
‘ it was busy times , moving clubs , houses and dealing with a new - born while it was hard on @entity23 as she was away from her family with a baby			2
‘ players will tell you it is never easy moving clubs and , in my case , there were maybe a few other things to take into account			0
’ some may have struggled under such pressure , especially as @entity2 was trying to impress a coach he had n’t even met before he turned up for that first day of training			1
the @entity54 scrum half in action against @entity56 where he got off to a rocky start for this club but , to his credit , @entity2 , who joined @entity5 after seven years at @entity27 , has displayed remarkable strength of character to take everything in his stride			1
on friday night , he will start his third match in a row as his new side take on @entity67 and is growing in stature with every passing game			0
the @entity10 star had signed a pre-contract agreement with @entity5 back in march when @entity6 was in charge			0
however , the @entity73 was sacked as director of rugby three months later after the @entity75 finished a lowly ninth in the @entity77			0
suddenly , @entity2 ’s position had changed dramatically , with there being no guarantee he would fit into the new man ’s plans			2
@entity5 's new signing at scrum half hopes he can add to his 31 @entity10 caps but has to play well former @entity87 head coach @entity86 took over but as he moved to @entity25 when @entity2 was on @entity10 duty in the @entity91 and @entity92 back in june , their paths did n’t cross			1
then @entity94 @entity93 , who @entity2 had never met , was appointed below @entity95 as head coach , which made pre-season training more of a ‘ getting to know you ’ experience than he ever expected			2
‘ you always have to prove yourself match by match but the changes meant maybe i had to do it again for the new coaching team , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ although i had n’t met @entity93 before i arrived at the club , he has been fantastic — as has @entity86 — and things are going really well			2
’ @entity6 had viewed @entity2 as a stand - off rather than a scrum - half — but it ’s at @entity111 where the @entity112 feels more comfortable and has earned most of his 31 caps			1
@entity2 tackles @entity115 ' @entity114 as he adapts to life in @entity117 , and life with a child ‘ @entity6 did mention i would move to stand - off when i first signed but i always told him i was a nine who could cover at 10 — that situation had n’t been resolved by the time he left , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it would have been interesting to see where i would have been playing if @entity6 was still here but i ’ve had chats with @entity86 and @entity93 and they want me as a scrum - half			1
‘ if that had n’t been the case , it would have been a bit of a worry for me when it came to @entity10 but fortunately i am starting at nine for @entity5			0
’ part of the reason for @entity2 being used at scrum - half is because the new coaching regime has brought in the 67 - times capped @entity73 @entity137 to play 10			1
their half - back partnership got off to a rocky start in their first league match as @entity5 lost 53 - 6 away to @entity143 , with @entity137 and @entity2 putting over a penalty each			1
the pressure was , therefore , on them in their first home game last weekend against @entity115 but both players stepped up to the mark			0
the @entity151 international ran the show , with @entity2 kicking 19 points as @entity5 won 34 - 27 in a thrilling match played in front of more than 13,000 fans			1
@entity10 will play @entity158 at @entity25 in the first match of the @entity160 and @entity2 wants to be there ‘ knowing that @entity137 had signed for @entity5 after me came as a nice surprise as it helped me see where i fitted into the picture at the club , ’ said 28 - year - old @entity161			1
‘ i feel our partnership is developing well and @entity167 is an easy player to play alongside			0
he is incredibly skilful and has the boot on him to put us in the right areas , which is vital in this league			0
’ @entity2 feels it is too early for him to compare the standard of play in the @entity77 to the @entity174 but the one big difference is the atmosphere at matches			2
‘ i am not against the @entity174 but the way the @entity77 is supported means there are no small games , ’ he said			0
‘ for instance , at our first game against @entity56 at @entity183 there was 14,000 people			0
we lost that match but still there were around 13,000 at @entity25 for our match against @entity115 and our game against @entity67 is nearing a sell - out			1
the @entity54 scrum half has won 31 caps for his country , occasionally playing in the number 10 role ‘ i always thought of @entity5 as a big club and it ’s lived up to expectations			1
the crowds are fantastic and what the club means to the people is similar to what the traditional clubs in the @entity202 mean to the locals back home			2
‘ the atmosphere week in , week out gets me excited and hopefully that , along with the competition for places at @entity5 , will drive my game forward			0
’ as @entity2 is just beginning a new life in @entity117 , he does n’t want to get too far ahead of himself in terms of the @entity160 — but , at the back of his mind , he has that ambition			1
‘ @entity10 ’s first match in the @entity160 against @entity158 will be at @entity25 and it would be great for me to be involved in that , ’ he said			2
‘ that would be an amazing experience but i am trying not to think that far ahead			0
play well for @entity5 this season and maybe i can make that happen next september			0
’ @entity222 is proud to be official partner of @entity224 , offering shower gels , face care and deodorants which deliver high performance and superior skin care			0
