by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 02:01 est , 28 may 2013 awkward questions : @entity3 @entity2 speaking at a @entity3 's @entity5 event in @entity6 this month the boss of @entity3 has declared himself ' perplexed ' by public anger at the internet giant 's meagre @entity10 tax contribution			1
@entity2 , @entity3 's executive chairman , hit back after politicians criticised the @entity14 - based company for generating billions of pounds from its @entity10 arm , but giving precious little back in taxes			2
@entity3 paid £ 10million in @entity10 corporation tax between 2006 and 2011 , despite pulling in revenues of £ 11.9billion			1
but mr @entity2 said the company had done what it was ' legally required ' to do and would not pay a penny more than the demanded			0
' what we are doing is legal , ' he said			0
' i 'm rather perplexed by this debate , which has been going in the @entity10 for some time , because i view taxes as not optional			0
' ' i view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required			0
it 's not a debate , you pay the taxes			0
' he said that the fault for @entity3 's low tax contribution lay at the door of politicians , who have not tweaked tax laws to catch up with a modern , globalised world			1
' if the @entity10 system changes the tax laws , then we will comply			2
if the taxes go up , we will pay more , if they go down , we will pay less			0
' ' that is a political decision for the democracy that is the @entity10 , ' he told the @entity45			0
@entity3 boss mr @entity2 has previously admitted that he ' ca n't defend ' an international tax system that he deems ' irrational '			1
but tax expert @entity47 , of the @entity49 , said mr @entity2 was n't abiding by the law , but simply side - stepping it by routing @entity10 sales through @entity53 , where taxes are lower			2
' let 's be clear , he 's actually not paying the right amount of tax , he 's getting round the law			2
if we change it , he 'll try to get around that law , ' said mr @entity47			0
unpopular : multinational giants @entity61 and @entity62 have suffered boycotts over public anger at their tax avoidance in the @entity10 he said mr @entity2 's comments proved that @entity10 needs a @entity68 , which could be applied to any attempt to lower tax bills artificially			1
' that would have undoubtedly caught their tax avoidance and then @entity2 would have to comply with @entity10 law , ' said mr @entity47			1
mr @entity2 's effort to turn the focus back on politicians comes just days after @entity3 was accused of doing ' evil ' by @entity78 ( lab , @entity80 ) , who chairs the parliamentary @entity81 looking into corporate tax			1
ms @entity83 was referring to the company 's famous motto ' do n't be evil ' , which she said did not stand up to scrutiny given its bargain - basement tax bill			2
political agenda : chancellor @entity89 is expected to use the @entity90 to push for a global battle on tax avoidance ' you are a company that says you " do no evil "			1
and i think that you do do evil , ' she said			0
ms @entity83 has called for a new committee to oversee the tax affairs of major companies			2
she said the committee could hold secret evidence sessions with companies , to allow them to debate tax issues without causing firms any public embarrassment			0
household names such as @entity61 and @entity62 have suffered boycotts , as consumers react to revelations of their tiny tax bills by taking their business elsewhere			1
mr @entity47 agreed that a special committee should be set up to look solely at tax			0
' @entity114 does n't have a minister responsible for it or a committee to review it and yet it 's at the centre of @entity10 politics , ' he said			0
' it 's time parliament took tax seriously and was given the funds to investigate just what 's going on			0
' tax avoidance has moved up the political agenda in recent weeks , ahead of next month 's @entity90 of the world 's economic superpowers			1
chancellor @entity89 is expected to use @entity10 's presidency of the @entity90 in 2013 to push for a global agreement on methods to battle tax avoidance			1
the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) is also drawing up a blueprint for global tax reform ahead of the larger @entity137 meeting of developed economies in september .			1

@entity3 paid only £ 10million in corporation tax between 2006 and 2011
