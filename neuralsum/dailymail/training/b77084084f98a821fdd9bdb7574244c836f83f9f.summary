in my long experience and years in football i can not recall such an occasion			1
since i joined the club in 1971 and before then , @entity8 were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart			1
it was always one of the best - run clubs in non-league football			2
they attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great @entity20			0
but for one reason or another it ’s gone away from that in the last few years			0
i ’m a member of the @entity25 ’ @entity26 and i try to keep on top of what is going on — it ’s not been nice to follow			0
@entity30 ( right ) celebrates after the famous win against @entity32 with @entity33 @entity8 's class of ' 72 , including @entity30 ( cntre left ) , celebrate victory against @entity32 i was with @entity33 just a couple of weeks ago filming something for the @entity37 about the @entity38 — it ’s a shame to go from that to this			1
we are all scattered far and wide from that side but the club remains a big part of us			2
what has happened has shocked me but i ca n’t say it has surprised me			0
what i hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the @entity25 ’ trust			2
it can work when you do it that way			0
i certainly ca n’t see a shining knight coming in			0
@entity30 scored the famous second goal in the 2 - 1 win when @entity57 knocked out @entity32 in the @entity38 third round in 1972			1
cash - strapped @entity8 were expelled from the @entity59 in june for failing to pay creditors @entity8 , also known as the @entity61 , have been hit by another punishment from the @entity38			1

@entity8 have been *banned* from all football activity
club were expelled from the @entity59 in june over *missed* payments
@entity30 scored famous goal against @entity32 in @entity38
