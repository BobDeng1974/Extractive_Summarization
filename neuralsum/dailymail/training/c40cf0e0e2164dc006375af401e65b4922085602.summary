by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 05:01 est , 11 november 2013 ' narcissist ' : serial killer @entity2 is serving life for murdering six people including @entity5 the brother of one of the victims of @entity10 ’s notorious serial killer @entity2 last night called for action to stop the murderer ’s memoirs being published on the internet			1
the @entity15 revealed last week how excerpts written by @entity2 , a former civil servant and police officer who is serving life for butchering six young men and trying to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 80s , had begun appearing on the web in defiance of a government ban			1
now @entity23 , whose oldest brother @entity5 died at the hands of @entity2 , has broken 30 years of silence to express the family ’s shock at the ease with which sections of the self - serving and ‘ pornographic ’ autobiography have been posted on two internet sites			1
the shock move comes despite the authorities , including former home secretary @entity34 and the @entity35 , repeatedly banning publication , claiming the lurid details of the killings would be distressing to the victims ’ families			2
last night , mr @entity5 , 47 , from @entity41 , said : ‘ this man is a monster and he should not be allowed a voice			2
this is attempting to glorify what he did , and it was the right decision to stop his autobiography ever being published			2
‘ it is disgraceful that reputable sites are being used to get round the ban and someone should do something to pull the plug on this before it goes any further			0
gag the monster before it ’s too late and before more damage is done			0
’ chapters posted over the past 10 days include material about @entity2 ’s early life and his dead grandfather - which is used to justify his later crimes			1
postings suggest further material is due to be placed online over coming weeks			2
it is known that copies of the autobiography were taken out of prison , but it is not clear who is responsible for putting the material on the internet - or whether they are acting on the instructions of the killer			1
@entity2 is denied access to the internet at @entity76 maximum security prison near @entity77			1
locked up : @entity2 is denied access to the internet at @entity76 maximum security prison near @entity77 mr @entity5 added : ‘ what has appeared so far is disgusting			1
why is action not being taken to stop this now ? ‘ take it down for the sake of the families who are still having to deal with what he did			0
it was n’t just our loved ones he killed			0
something died inside my parents and my brothers and sisters			0
we ’ve never had anywhere to go to grieve for @entity5 because of what @entity2 did to him and the horror of how he died and what happened to him afterwards never leaves us			1
’ in 1996 @entity2 wrote his life story , @entity2 : @entity101			1
a copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor , but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned			0
tragic : @entity107 vanished aged 26 when he left @entity41 to find work in @entity109 @entity2 went to the @entity35 two years ago claiming his writings ‘ stimulated much academic and medical debate ’ but the case was dismissed			1
@entity2 , 67 , who grew up in @entity113 , @entity114 , worked as an @entity116 cook for 11 years before joining the @entity117 for eight months and later the civil service			1
between 1978 and 1983 , he killed at least 15 men and boys but claimed he could not remember the names of nine			2
all his victims were students or mostly homeless men whom he took to his house either for sex or just for company			2
once there , they were strangled or drowned			0
eventually , he would dismember them and hide the remains , storing these under floorboards or in bin bags stuffed into a wardrobe			0
unsuspecting @entity5 , 26 , a divorcee with a girlfriend and three - year - old son , left his home in @entity136 , @entity41 , for @entity109 in august 1980 to find a job but mysteriously ‘ vanished ’ within days of arriving in the capital			0
he had worked as a chef in @entity109 previously and hoped to find something similar when he visited the job centre where @entity2 worked			1
hearing his @entity144 accent , the killer suggested they to go for a drink			0
@entity5 would become @entity2 ’s fourth victim that night but it was another three years before his family discovered he was dead			1
they reported his disappearance in 1980 to police in @entity109 and he remained a ‘ missing person ’ until @entity2 ’s killing spree was uncovered in 1983			1
what has appeared so far is disgusting			0
why is action not being taken to stop this now ? - @entity23 , brother to @entity5 mr @entity5 said : ‘ my mum was watching the news on tv			0
they were digging up @entity2 ’s garden , looking for bodies			1
there was a knock at the door and it was detectives to say they had found parts of @entity5 under @entity2 ’s floorboards			1
there was a piece of skin with a tattoo on it and his false teeth , which forensics used to confirm his identity			0
the whole family were in shock			0
’ in 1983 , @entity2 was found guilty of six murders – including @entity5 ’s - and two attempted murders			1
the @entity182 has said @entity2 will never be released			1
mr @entity5 added : ‘ a memorial service was held for @entity5 but my dad , a proud marine engineer , could n’t face going back to his job and my mum developed depression			0
her only hope was when she died she would see @entity5 again			0
she also hoped to see @entity2 die in prison but that never happened			1
my parents are dead now and i can never forgive @entity2 for the misery he put them both through			1
’ it was not just the circumstances of @entity5 ’s death , however , which tortured his family but the casual – and , they believe , untrue – comment to police by @entity2 after his arrest that the @entity203 had been a male prostitute			2
genuine : professor @entity205 , who met @entity2 , said the posts appear to ' genuinely the work of the serial killer ' it is a description which has remained for 33 years and one his siblings can never accept			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ one of our brothers is actually gay and laughed at the idea of @entity5 being homosexual			0
he was the biggest womaniser going			0
he had been married and gone on to have a son with another girlfriend			0
knowing @entity5 , he probably thought @entity2 was being friendly towards him because they were both @entity144			2
‘ i hate the fact every time i search on the internet for “ @entity5 ” – which is also the name of my son – that a picture of my brother comes up with the words “ male prostitute ” next to a photograph of @entity2			2
’ he added : ‘ i ’m angry that ’s how my brother ’s remembered and i ’m angry @entity2 ’s book is being published			2
this has to stop now			0
we ’re not dealing with fiction here – real lives have been destroyed because of this man ’s heinous crimes			0

@entity2 is serving a life sentence at @entity76 prison near @entity77
he murdered six young men and attempted to kill two others
