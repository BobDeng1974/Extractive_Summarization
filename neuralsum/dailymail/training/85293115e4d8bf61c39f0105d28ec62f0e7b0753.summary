in last year ’s landmark ruling the @entity3 was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of ‘ social engineering ’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old			2
the report also said shows such as @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 were accused of using ‘ token women ’ on their panels			2
it said : ' some panel shows were ... criticised for rarely having women represented or only having ‘ token women ’ on their programmes			0
' comedy shows , such as @entity48 or @entity49 , as well as current affairs programmes such as @entity47 were implicated in this			0

discrimination : @entity78 is the only female panellist in this @entity49 panel which also features ( back row ( l to @entity81 ) @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and front host @entity86 and @entity87			0
they said they thought it was generally the case that ‘ a person develops “ a face for radio ” at a certain point in their middle years ’ and were ‘ replaced with what people felt were less qualified but younger , more attractive women ’			0
among the positive role models for older generations were @entity102 ’s character in @entity103 , the experts on @entity105 and @entity106			2
strictly come dancing was praised for the broad range of ages among competitors , but concerns were raised that older contestants , such as @entity25 , were being exploited as ‘ figures of fun ’			1
all male panel : @entity47 , chaired by @entity116 , was singled out for putting only a ' token ' woman on their panel			0
he is pictured with @entity120 , left , and @entity121 one woman : @entity123 , the environment minister , is the ' token ' female representative on this @entity47 panel which features footballer @entity125 , far left age discrimination : @entity35 won a substantial payout after showing the @entity3 sacked her from @entity128 because of her age viewers said the retired politician had been put on @entity27 ' for a laugh ' although she could ' hardly dance '			1

' we did n’t like older people making a fool of themselves on telly , producers and directors … are taking advantage and are using it for entertainment , ' he said			1
' an example of this would be ( @entity27 ) @entity148 … its just embarrassing … i do n’t like seeing older folk being exploited			1
' the serving all @entity152 survey of 180 viewers aged 13 to 92 , carried out for the @entity3 by independent social research institute @entity154 , warned these ‘ dated and inaccurate stereotypes ’ could result in older people feeling ‘ marginalised ’			1
