@entity8 , 20 , was found dead in her @entity10 home last october when police launched a homicide investigation			1
they suspect the crime scene in @entity15 had been tampered with so it would appear @entity16 had committed suicide			1
murdered : police officers originally believed that @entity8 had committed suicide but later discovered she had been killed relatives say the key clue to busting the case and nabbing the murderer is a $ 1,500 @entity24 hamper for which @entity8 had saved hard - following her death it was redirected to the ' murderer 's ' family , they claim			1
they also say money was withdrawn from her account after her death and that the person they believe has information about her death was seen selling drugs on the actual day @entity8 died			1
the family are outraged that social media has been used to shift blame onto an innocent man and also say @entity16 's car has disappeared			1
they are begging for those who have information to come forward and demand justice , at the very least , for @entity8 's adored 23 - month - old son , @entity44 , who was in the home , in the out - lying @entity10 suburb , when @entity8 was found dead			1
' i want whoever did this to be punished , ' @entity8 's mother @entity47 told the @entity51 ' it 's hard to describe			1
it 's the worst place you could possibly be			1
all you do is get up every day and hope it 's a dream			2
' ms @entity47 , said she had feared for some time for her daughter 's safety			1

' she would just say it was play - fighting			0
that she bruised easily , ' ms @entity47 said			2
@entity8 's uncle , @entity62 , said that on another occasion he saw his niece with bruises on her upper body and wanted to do something about it , but she talked him out of it			1
' i said , " why do n't you bring him around here and we 'll do something about it , " ' he said			0
' there are people out there who definitely know what happened			0
they need to come forward and tell the truth for @entity16			0
' ms @entity47 said she knew as soon as police arrived at the door on october 23 that @entity8 was dead			1
' i said , " what 's he done to her ? what 's he done to her ? " ' she said			2
mother and daughter were close and had met the day before @entity8 was found dead			0
' she said , " i love you "			0
we said we loved each other every time we saw each other , ' ms @entity47 recalled			2
' she said , " i 'll see you tomorrow			0
" ' @entity8 's grandfather , @entity94 , said he had been changed by her death , and was even having dreams about killing the man he believes is responsible , or having him bashed			1
' i 'm not that sort of person , ' mr @entity98 said			0
' it 's frightened me			2
we 're the good people			0
they 're the bad people			0
that 's why we do n't do that sort of stuff			2
' those closest to the cheerful ' go - getter ' said they immediately knew @entity16 had n't taken her own life			0
' we all knew , the night we were told , it was n't suicide , ' friend @entity111 said			0
another friend , @entity114 , described @entity8 as an amazing mother and said ms @entity8 had lived with her boyfriend and their son in the @entity120 home for three years			0
' she always put her son first			0
if he looks over this when he 's older , we want him to realise how amazing she was , ' ms @entity114 said .			1
