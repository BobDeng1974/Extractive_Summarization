a @entity55 spokesperson said : ‘ our focus remains the humanitarian situation , particularly those trapped on @entity18			0

@entity210 mp @entity209 became the latest to join politicians and former military chiefs in urging a stronger response , including targeted air strikes and drone attacks - but falling short of sending ground forces back to the country			1
he predicted a recalled commons would vote in favour of the escalation			0
it comes as former @entity222 leader sir @entity222 has added his voice to mounting calls for @entity37 to reconvene to discuss @entity3 's response			0
