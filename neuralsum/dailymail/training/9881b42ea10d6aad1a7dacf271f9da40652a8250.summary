probe : the @entity4 has suspended an employee over allegations of exchange rate fixing the investigation was prompted by a claim from a currency trader that @entity4 officials had told him that it was ok to share information with rival banks while setting key exchange rate benchmarks			1
the officials allegedly told him they had no policy on colluding to set rates , and that banks were free to make their own rules			0
in a statement today , the @entity4 said : ' it is a matter of public record that the @entity4 has been conducting an internal review into allegations that @entity4 officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the foreign exchange market or the sharing of confidential client information			2
' this extensive review of documents , emails and other records has to date found no evidence that @entity4 staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information			1
