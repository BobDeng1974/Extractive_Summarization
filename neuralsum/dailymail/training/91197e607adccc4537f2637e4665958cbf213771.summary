the original @entity0 has taken to playing poker , which might explain why he is willing to take a punt on such a weak hand			1
with the waiting nearly over , one of the @entity6 greats is weighing up the contenders			1
then he mentions pressure and @entity10			1
one of the most fascinating sub-plots of a magnificently open competition will be how that 22 - year - old deals with the demands of his country			0
as @entity0 knows , @entity18 strikers do n’t carry light loads			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity0 being double bluffed by @entity21 are you sure ? @entity8 's @entity0 believes that @entity23 have a chance of winning the @entity25 gotcha ! @entity0 was tricked by his former @entity6 teammate @entity21 ( r ) then @entity0 mentions @entity23			1
in this summer of muted hopes , it may be the first prediction from any major footballing figure outside @entity32 ’s squad			2
@entity0 wants to throw some chips down			2
‘ you never know in football , ’ he says			0
‘ over the years the sport has shown us great examples of this so you can not say a team are not potential winners			0
@entity23 should definitely be considered , they can surprise us			2
@entity44 are very good but @entity8 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 are the strongest			2
’ for @entity0 , it ’s nice to talk about football			2
he is the ambassador who is not a politician			0
not in the sense that @entity51 is , his immediate predecessor in @entity8 ’s list of great strikers			0
the two men do n’t get on terribly well these days			0
their spats over the past year of organisational chaos have become something of a feature			0
hope : @entity59 scored in a shock friendly 2 - 2 against @entity8 at the @entity61 , june 2013 while @entity51 , the star of @entity8 ’s 1994 win , has turned to politics and been one of the loudest critics of the country ’s prioritisation of football over social policies , @entity0 , the inspiration of their 2002 triumph , has been one of the event ’s major cheerleaders			1
while @entity51 has focused on the serious issues , @entity0 has largely wanted to talk football and the glorious unpredictability of this @entity6 , one where @entity8 may be challenged by the little man called @entity79 who lives next door			1
the potential exists for a great event and it also allows room for an enormous capitulation , such is the expectation in @entity8 for a sixth @entity6 win			1
great expectations : the pressure will be on @entity8 's next brightest star @entity10 at the @entity6 it is a pressure that could become relevant , according to a man who won one final , was an unused substitute in another and was central to the mother of all pre-final scandals in 1998			1
‘ @entity8 has a great chance , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ we played in the @entity98 and demonstrated what we can do ( with a 3 - 0 demolition of @entity47 in the final )			0
we have a solid defence , a midfield that battles very hard and great goalscorers			0
‘ we are at home and have an exceptional player in @entity10			2
the pressure will be greater than normal but the fans ’ support will spur the team on			0
@entity112 engineering : @entity113 could beat @entity0 's goal scoring record of 15 goals there is also the small matter of @entity0 ’s record of 15 @entity6 goals which could be taken by @entity113 , that most un-brazilian of @entity112 strikers			1
‘ i am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ it would be nice to keep it for a while longer but i am cheering for someone to break the record			0
it will be good for the sport			0
’ so would an @entity23 triumph , but that seems an altogether riskier bet			2
one of the most prestigious @entity6 records will be there for the taking when @entity113 resumes his brilliant relationship with the event			1
in the past three editions he has amassed 14 goals , and will overtake @entity0 ’s record if he nets twice in @entity8			1
he is the man who has often come close , but not gone close enough			0
he is the @entity143 striker who is not a star			0
his nickname is @entity146 and his game is no more flamboyant			0
his notable @entity6 record is that he is the only man to score five headers in a single competition			1
nice , but not nice enough for many billboards			0
yet this is a numbers game			0
and in a game of international numbers @entity113 is a superstar			2
@entity113 has been steady for his clubs , but 206 goals in 524 games is not the stuff of legends			1
however , on the international stage he is a machine			0
aged 35 , he is level with @entity163 on 68 goals for @entity45			1
where they differ is that when @entity113 scores for @entity45 they never lose			1
that might bode well this summer for @entity45 and the modest man who does so much to make them shine .			1

@entity18 @entity0 believes that @entity23 could win the @entity25
@entity0 admits that @entity10 will feel the weight of expectation this summer
@entity45 's @entity113 could beat @entity0 's record of 15 @entity6 goals
