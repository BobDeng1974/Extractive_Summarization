@entity1 's second - half try and the boot of @entity3 helped @entity4 beat @entity5 25 - 18 and gain some revenge at @entity7			1
a fortnight ago the @entity8 saw off the @entity4 in a thrilling @entity9 semi-final and the teams met again at @entity7 in the @entity12 , with the hosts hoping for a different outcome having lost just once in front of their own fans this season			1
and despite former @entity21 @entity20 and @entity22 going over for the @entity8 , the home side were celebrating as @entity3 kicked 20 points and @entity1 crossed the whitewash , with @entity4 climbing above @entity5 in the table in the process			1

barely three minutes later , @entity34 again missed a penalty after @entity4 's @entity40 had failed to move out of the way and the @entity4 made them pay with @entity3 putting a penalty of their own away to give the @entity4 the lead			1
with high balls causing havoc in the swirling wind and handling errors from @entity5 , @entity3 then added a second penalty for @entity4 on 18 minutes to double the home side 's lead			1
@entity5 finally got on the board in the 23nd minute with @entity34 this time successful with a kick from his own half			0
in the 36th minute the @entity4 regained their six - point lead after @entity5 failed to roll away after an excellent break from @entity40 , with @entity3 making no mistake again from the tee			2
it came at a price though with @entity40 leaving the field injured , replaced by @entity60			0
the @entity4 almost had the first try of the game on the stroke of half - time after another breakaway , but had to make do with a fourth penalty from @entity3 as @entity4 went into the break with a 12 - 3 lead			1
fly half @entity3 kicked six penalties for @entity4 as they overcame @entity5 @entity8 ' @entity20 scores a try against his former club @entity8 ' @entity22 also scored a try but it was not enough to prevent his side from losing it was the @entity4 on the front foot from the start of the second half and with barely a minute gone they were awarded a penalty with @entity3 , in imperious form with the boot , slotting home his fifth penalty of the match to put @entity4 further in front			1
@entity5 swiftly made changes with the hope of getting back into the game with @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 coming on			0
and it made the immediate impact as hoped with @entity20 scoring the first try of the game after an @entity5 drive near the posts			2
@entity34 inexplicably missed the conversion , hitting the post when it seemed easier to score			0
