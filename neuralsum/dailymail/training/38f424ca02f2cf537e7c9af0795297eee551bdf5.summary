by @entity0 published : 13:12 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 22 may 2013 a cold , rainy day can make the heart fall			0
but it could also cause potentially deadly changes in blood pressure			1
research shows many people ’s blood pressure varies with temperature , with a drop in the mercury particularly damaging			1
over time , these fluctuations raise the odds of dying by more than a third			0
lack of sunshine and inches of rain can also take their toll , the @entity15 study found			0
rain , rain go away : @entity25 researchers found that @entity27 weather could be putting people 's health at risk because sudden drops in air temperature affect blood pressure while the finding may seem odd , blood vessels near the surface are known to narrow in cold weather , to conserve heat , which increases blood pressure			1
blood pressure changes put the body under strain and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
researchers said doctors should note the weather when measuring a patient ’s blood pressure			1
this would help them determine which patients are sensitive to it so they can adjust their treatment accordingly			0
heart expert @entity55 made the link after comparing more than 40 years of blood pressure data on patients in the @entity60 with meteorological data for the area			1
it showed half of the patients were sensitive to drops in temperature , such as those that occur between summer and winter			0
a fall of around @entity70 led to an increase in blood pressure of between 3mm and 6mm of mercury			1
while this might not seem much , a change of just 2mm is enough to significantly affect the odds of fatal heart attacks and strokes			1
dr @entity55 said : ‘ every millimetre counts , that ’s the important thing			0
’ further analysis showed those whose blood pressure was sensitive to temperature were 35 per cent more likely to die over the period studied			1
lack of sunshine also increased blood pressure – likely due to dull days tending to be colder			2
rain was found to be damaging but the researchers attributed this to patients becoming stressed while struggling to the doctor ’s in wet weather			0
heart attacks and strokes are more common in winter , but the study , published in the journal @entity99 , is the first to look at the issue in detail			2
dr @entity55 said doctors need to be aware of the link to properly manage blood pressure			2
otherwise a good reading in summer may lead to a patient missing out on potentially vital medicine			0
similarly , someone who is known to be sensitive to temperature could pay extra attention to what they eat and how much exercise they do , to keep their heart healthy			0
a @entity118 @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ it is really interesting to know there may be a relationship between the weather and blood pressure ; more research is needed to understand the potential mechanisms behind this			1
‘ however until we can control the weather , we can still rely on more traditional ways of controlling our blood pressure , such as eating more fruit and vegetables , less salt and alcohol , and taking more exercise			2
‘ even if the sun is n’t shining , i would advise going for a brisk walk as a reliable way of reducing your long - term blood pressure			2
’ high blood pressure affects almost 16million people in the @entity27			0
scientists have recommended doctors note the weather when taking the blood pressure of patients because it may give a truer reflection of a person 's health			0

@entity25 research found air temperature changes affect blood pressure
sudden fluctuations in blood pressure have been linked to heart attacks
a drop in air temperature was understood to be most damaging to humans
