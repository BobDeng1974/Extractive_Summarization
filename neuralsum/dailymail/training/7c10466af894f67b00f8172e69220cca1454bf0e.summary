she purrs and meows like any normal cat			0
but she does n't make any mess and her detachable fur can even be put in the washing machine			1
the @entity5 has been developed by academics in @entity7 to offer comfort , pleasure and peace of mind to people suffering with dementia			1
while she may look like a cuddly toy , the inventors insist she is much more like a medical device and , as such , she comes with a hefty price tag of around £ 1,000			1
companion : the @entity5 has been developed by academics in @entity7 to offer comfort , pleasure and peace of mind to people suffering with dementia - basically the benefits of a pet without the mess help : while she may look like a cuddly toy , the inventors insist she is much more like a medical device - hence the price tag of around £ 1,000 the technology is the result of a partnership between health care researchers at @entity36 in @entity7 and robotics experts at the @entity39 company			1
the creator , professor @entity40 , said she is now being released for sale across @entity43 and her benefits are so great that she might even be prescribed by doctors			2
the professor in computer science said the project started with a study of people with dementia and involved trials and interviews with carers			1
he said : ‘ the care - givers used @entity57 as a tool for relaxation , to calm down the patient with dementia and as a distraction to help deal with agitation that might disturb other patients			1
‘ the cat encourages and stimulates communication , she allows the patients to recall memories of their own cats and distracts repetitive behaviour			0
’ the professor said : ‘ the functions of @entity5 means it resembles a live cat in many ways in that it breathes , purrs and meows			1
' one advantage with the cat 's fur is that it is washable and above all is removable and thus can meet hygiene requirements in an institution			2
’ the robotic cat is about the same size and weight as a normal cat , and comes in grey or black and white , however it does n’t move beyond the impression it is breathing			0
professor @entity40 said : ‘ @entity5 can provide peace , be soothing and be a tool for increased interaction and communication			1
‘ it is a complement in the care of people with dementia and in the care of people with intellectual disabilities			1
tests and research demonstrates positive results from the users , as well as patients and care - givers			2
‘ the goal of @entity5 is to enrich the daily lives of people with dementia			1
it can provide increased psychological , physical and social well - being			2
’ importantly , he said the cat also provides some respite to nurses and carers because dementia suffers who take to her are generally calmer and easy to communicate with			2
he defended the high cost saying : ‘ this is not a toy			0
you can buy a toy much cheaper , but it will not have the same effect			0
it is classified as a class one medical device class and therefore a doctor can prescribe it			1
it is hygienic , a toy is not			0
’ the robotic cat is already available in several countries in @entity43 and the company is planning to meet a potential @entity136 distributor this week			0
the development is the latest evidence as to how robotics will increasingly be used in the future to provide practical help in the home as well as psychological support , particularly to the elderly			0
@entity136 academics recently revealed their part in the development of the @entity148 , which is both a home help and a friend to older people who may be ill , or feel trapped and alone at home			2
benefit : @entity57 resembles a live cat in many ways in that it breathes , purrs and meows			0
one advantage with the cat 's fur is that it is washable and removable - so can meet hygiene requirements in an institution ' the @entity5 also provides some respite to nurses and carers because dementia suffers who use her are generally calmer , it is claimed the robot is the result of a collaboration between @entity136 and @entity43 academics under the umbrella of @entity174			1
the hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life , rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home			1
the team , which is co-ordinated by dr @entity182 , ( correct ) of the @entity183 , have combined a robot ‘ butler ’ and software from a range of experts to deliver @entity148			0
importantly , the machine does far more than fetching and carrying , for it has been programmed to be a friend , providing emotional support to someone living alone			0
it will suggest activities to motivate people who otherwise might spend their day , parked in a chair in front of a tv , never speaking to anyone – and it will call for help if they are in trouble			0
the lcd screen offers images of a face that is smiling and happy when a task has been successful and will look downcast or sad when there is a problem , such as the user forgetting to take their medication			0
it will also provide the social interaction , someone to talk to , that will help people stave off loneliness and depression .			0

the @entity5 has been developed by academics in @entity7
offers ' comfort , pleasure and peace of mind to people with dementia '
benefits : no mess and machine washable - so it is *suitable* for care homes
inventors insist she is a medical device , not a toy - hence costing £ 1,000
