a mysterious skeleton found buried inside a lead coffin beside the remains of @entity3 could belong to a revered holy woman who was said to reduce time spent in purgatory for those that prayed for her soul			1
archaeologists believe the elderly woman , whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix , may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last @entity16 king of @entity17			1
her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in @entity21 on what was the site of the @entity24 church , just feet from @entity3 's grave			1
the blow that killed @entity3 in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull , scientists studying his remains have revealed			2
forensic pathologists at @entity55 , discovered two wounds at the base of the king 's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium			0
the findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king 's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull			0
genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in @entity74 three years ago , has confirmed that it did belong to @entity3 scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet			1
using modern medical scanners , they established that the @entity17 monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the @entity85 in 1485			0
analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the @entity55 has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life , eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish			1
it is thought that she had died in her 60s			0
this suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar			1
this all suggests she had special significant to the catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary , archaeologists leading the excavation believe			1
they have found clues that suggest one of the women buried there was highly revered			0
records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded , more than 700 years ago , show that the @entity118 offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a @entity122 in @entity74			1
dated to 1250 , it offered a month off the pains of purgatory for anyone who would say ' a @entity127 and a ave for the soul of @entity130 , wife of @entity132 , whose body is buried in the @entity134 in @entity74 '			2
however , according to @entity136 , lead archaeologist at @entity55 and site director for the excavation , she is thought to be from @entity139 in @entity140			1
however , little more is known about @entity142 , and it was likely none of women found buried under @entity24 will ever be completely identified			1
he said : ' we do n't know much more about her			0
we know she was buried around 1290 in the friary church , but we do n't know her age at death , what she did for a living or what she looked like			2
the lead coffin was found inside a limestone sarcophagus ( above ) under the choir of the @entity24 church archaeologists had to carefully remove stone lid on top the coffin ( above ) in order to exhume the body the lead coffin had been damaged by water around the feet ( above ) causing the skeleton to become damaged ' we do n't have any known descendants who can provide a dna sample , so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we can not link the two together			1
' unfortunately this skeleton will always remain anonymous			0
' the twisted and battled scarred skeleton of @entity3 was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012			1
subsequent dna work has positively confirmed the skeleton as belonging to the @entity16 king			0
he had been buried in a crudely dug grave within the church in 1485			2
further excavations on the site in august 2013 , however , revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman			1
a further eight graves containing women were found around the spot where @entity3 had been buried			2
scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old @entity24 church , which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of @entity3 the sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as @entity3 but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin mr @entity136 said : ' what stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials – large , neatly dug graves with coffins – and the crudeness of @entity3 ’s grave			1
' the more we examine it , the clearer it becomes how atypical @entity3 ’s burial really was			0
' in total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of @entity24 and left six undisturbed			1
two graves , inside the choir , contained wooden coffins with a woman inside each aged between 40 and 50 years old			0
radiocarbon dating shows that they probably died between 1270 and 1400 , while osteological analysis of the bones show that one of the women had a congenital hip dislocation that would have forced her to walk with a crutch			2
the other woman was found to have lived a life of hard physical labour , regularly using her arms and legs to life heavy weights			0
the stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled ( shown above ) due to the weight of the lid @entity136 ( above ) led the excavation , which was done by hand rather than using heavy lifting machinery archaeologists uncovered @entity249 floor tiles during the excavation that they believe would have formed the floor of the friary under which the body of @entity3 and the women found on the site were buried another skeleton , which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work , also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid- 20s			1
however , it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists			1
it is the first to be found in @entity74 in a modern excavation			0
mr @entity136 said : ' the stone sarcophagus was a tapered box carved from a single block of limestone			2
inside , the wider end was curved , creating a broad head niche			0
' unfortunately , the stone lid did not properly fit the coffin allowing water to get inside , and its immense weight had badly cracked the sarcophagus , meaning it could not be lifted intact			2
' however , inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton ’s feet			1
' initially the coffin was taken to @entity282 to be examined for an endoscope in case any tissue had been preserved			0
mr @entity136 said that while the body had decayed to leave only a skeleton , fragments of cloth and hair were still intact			0
he said : ' opening a lead coffin was an interesting experience			2
it is a little like opening a tin can			0
there were a few fragments of linen or cloth and cord - these might be the remains of the shroud			0
a little bit of hair survived as well			0
' a grave like this you have go to think this person was important to the friars			0
we know this woman was over 60 when she died			0
stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat			1
' when you compare her diet with @entity3 it is only just below his adult diet			2

archaeologists discovered the bones of an elderly woman in a lead coffin
@entity327 was within a stone sarcophagus just feet from @entity3 's grave
they were found under a car park that was the site of @entity24 church
the lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix and buried close to the high altar
analysis suggests the woman had *enjoyed* a diet high in sea fish and meat
she probably died around 1250 - 200 years before @entity3 died in battle
she was probably a wealthy benefactor of the friary when it was first built
experts say she may have been @entity142 from @entity139 , @entity140
praying for @entity142 's soul was said to cut time in purgatory by 30 days
