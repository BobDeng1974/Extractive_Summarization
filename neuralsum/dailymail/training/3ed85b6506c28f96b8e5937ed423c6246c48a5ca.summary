wandering on to the patio at a friend ’s 40th birthday , i pull my husband , @entity4 , towards me and nuzzle my face into his neck , inhaling his aftershave like a lovesick teenager on a first date			1
of course , i ’m far from a teen — we ’ve been married for 23 years , tying the knot two years after meeting through mutual friends			1
so what accounts for my frisky , romantic mood ? well , it could be the cocktails			1
or the fact that on this balmy evening , the air is thick with the grassy scent of summer			1
or the fact that @entity4 , a 49 - year - old chartered accountant — still so handsome after all these years , with his thick , floppy hair and a physique honed by cycling — looks especially dashing in his crisp shirt and chinos			1
wedded bliss : the catalyst for this unrepentant @entity29 was the sight of a newly divorced friend hovering on the margins of the lawn but it was n’t any of the above			1
the catalyst for this unrepentant @entity29 was the sight of a newly divorced friend hovering on the margins of the lawn , clearly adrift without a partner by her side			1
not that i ’m territorial about my husband — i ’m not one of those insecure wives who arm - locks her spouse at the first whiff of another woman ’s @entity46			1
i like to be around freshly minted divorcees and actively encourage them to come for dinner or drop in for coffee			2
and my reasons are unapologetically pragmatic			2
watching an ex-wife navigate a party teeming with couples is a frank reminder that her fabled grass is n’t any greener — all fresh starts and new opportunities — it ’s just more grass			2
and it looks markedly less lush than my carefully tended lawn			2
most importantly , it sparks a reflex reaction to slip my hand into @entity4 ’s and squeeze , reminding myself — and him — how much i still love him after all these years			2
@entity67 , a relationships counsellor who runs the @entity69 clinic in @entity70 , agrees : ‘ the aftermath of divorce is incredibly painful			2
witnessing this first - hand can encourage couples — especially those dissatisfied with their marriage — to do everything they can to make it work			1
’ that ’s why i ’ve no truck with the so - called domino - divorce effect — the notion that if a close friend or colleague splits up it triggers other break - ups within their social circle			2
the aftermath of divorce is incredibly painful			2
witnessing this first - hand can encourage couples — especially those dissatisfied with their marriage — to do everything they can to make it work @entity67 , relationships counsellor i realise this herd mentality seems endemic			1
indeed , one @entity93 study estimated that if the marriage of someone close to you breaks down , your own chance of getting divorced is as much as 75 per cent			1
the hypothesis being that close proximity to divorce makes you question your own marriage , and helps remove the stigma of deciding to walk if you ’ve had enough of your own spouse			1
but , for me , a divorce in my social circle acts as a clarion call to count my blessings , and focus on strengthening what i have			1
before i go on , let me be clear that i understand there are some insoluble marital problems , such as domestic violence ( whether physical or emotional ) or serial affairs , that make it impossible for a wife to remain with her husband			2
however , in recent years i ’ve been shocked by the number of friends and colleagues who decided to get divorced simply because they felt a nebulous disaffection towards their marriage			1
or as one old friend told me : ‘ i was fed up — and could n’t face another 40 years of this			2
’ and so she disposed of her husband — an amiable , witty chap — tossing aside their lovely home and their life with their three children like a scrunched - up @entity131			2
did she think that a dashing fighter pilot or heart - meltingly handsome white knight would be immune to leaving his socks on the floor or dozing in front of the telly after a long day saving the world ? i ’ve interviewed plenty of high - profile men over the years — and it ’s clear from talking to their wives that they snore as loudly as the rest of the male population			1
but my friend went on to discover this the hard way , as i learnt a couple of weeks ago			0
she told me that after hurling herself on to the dating scene and kissing a few frogs she thought she ’d found a prince — significantly solvent , ruggedly handsome , with children who had left home			0
and so my friend raised her hopes only for them to be dashed on the altar of his insecurity , commitment phobia and good old - fashioned male selfishness			0
secret to marriage success : @entity165 sees ex-wives as her marriage life - line now she ’s back in the ring , with tales of an unseemly scramble with other divorcees to nab an eligible bloke — or one who at least has his own hair and teeth			1
just listening to her made me long to be at home , curled up on the sofa with @entity4			0
yet still there are plenty of women who regret , despite having manifest domestic stability , ‘ settling ’ for anything other than turbo - charged sex or starry - eyed romance			0
little wonder a recent survey of family lawyers revealed that the most popular cause for divorce was that couples were simply ‘ no longer in love ’ and had ‘ grown apart ’			0
i remember the very first divorce in my social circle			0
it happened several years ago , crashing over our group like a tsunami			0
i was just so shocked that , after raising three children very close in age , this couple could come out the other side — then throw it all away			0
neither had a specific reason			0
it just seemed that a once robust relationship had shattered into boredom , resentment and frustration			0
they hinted that having married in their early 20s and spent 15 years together , they felt there was a new world out there , waiting for them to enjoy			0
did i feel envious ? after all , i was also married in my early 20s , and in over two decades since then there have been times when i ’ve felt restless or frustrated by domestic life			0
on days when my husband nags me about forgetting to lock my car and the children squabble endlessly , i think of the young , bright , fancy - free woman in my head who yearns for romance and freedom			0
but then i tell myself — and it ’s not always easy — she is still there			0
and she can work hard to indulge those feelings			0
she just needs to do so with the man she loves			0
anyway , such restlessness is balanced by those moments when you walk into a cosy house and see all the people most precious to you , curled up on sofas like puppies			0
when i spot another ex-wife , i see her not as a threat , but as my @entity239 line — the secret to keeping my own marriage afloat but there are other ways my divorced friends help consolidate my marriage too			1
living in a close - knit community , where the dining room table is the heart of our social life , the break - up of a couple elicits a rush by us smug still - marrieds to ‘ take in ’ one partner or the other for a home - cooked meal			0
often we ’re invited out to dinner where one half of a divorced couple is on the guest list			1
looking across the table , i slip my hand into @entity4 ’s and think : ‘ i never want to become someone else ’s good deed			0
’ deep down , i suspect women who get divorced do n’t enjoy their ‘ freedom ’ as much as they claim			1
research this year found that , even in the age of the pre-nup and the fault - free divorce , almost half of divorcees believe their lives are damaged by the stigma			0
but these hapless , disorientated , newly divorced friends spur me on — to slip into a new , slinky dress ; to have my hair freshly styled ; to recognise that , however frustrating my husband ’s peccadilloes , they ’re no more so than any other man ’s			1
or , for that matter , my own			0
so when i spot another ex-wife , i see her not as a threat , but as my @entity239 line — the secret to keeping my own marriage afloat .			1
