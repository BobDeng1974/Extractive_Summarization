with its grandiose architecture , 10ft tall chandeliers and ornate plasterwork this former movie theater was once a symbol of @entity7 's growing wealth , without peers within the city for its elegance and grandness			1
but the once glorious and now decrepit @entity13 currently stands a shadow of its former self - saved only from the wrecking ball after it was turned into a car park			1
the theater , with its @entity20 - style decor , was developed on the site of @entity23 's first automobile workshop in 1925 at a cost of about $ 3.5million - roughly $ 46million today			1
grand : the once glorious and now decrepit @entity13 currently stands a shadow of its former self - it was built as a 4,000 - capacity movie theater but is now used as a car park and includes office and retail space former glories : the theater , with its @entity20 - style decor , was developed on the site of @entity23 's first automobile workshop in 1925 at a cost of about $ 3.5million - roughly $ 46million today downfall : in a tragic twist of irony , one of the reasons the movie theater eventually closed down in the 1970s was due to its lack of car parking but in a tragic twist of irony , one of the reasons the movie theater eventually closed down in the 1970s was due to its lack of car parking , according to @entity47			1
shortly after the opening of the theater , which could accommodate more than 4,000 people , its owner @entity48 said : ' it is not merely a theater for @entity55			2
it is a theater for the whole world			0
it is designed to be the greatest showplace of the @entity60			0
' however , the 1,000 sq ft theater 's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty @entity7			1
it was forced to branch out and started hosting ice hockey games , as well as concerts by the likes of @entity69 and @entity70			0
it was eventually closed and partially demolished in 1976 , but plans to completely tear it down had to be stopped due to the structural damage it would have caused adjoining buildings			1
so a year after it shut it was converted into a car park by the local authorities			1
then and now : the interior of the @entity13 ( left ) , as pictured in 1927 , and how it looks now ( right ) , a shadow of its former self after being turned into a car park opening : the site was described as ' a theater for the whole world ' by its owner @entity48 following its opening			1
he said it was ' designed to be the greatest showplace of the @entity60 ' industrial decline : however , the 1,000 sq ft theater 's fortunes mirrored the decline in industry in the once mighty @entity7 according to @entity55 , the 13 - floor site , which also contains an office building and first floor retail space , was up for sale for $ 3million in december			1
the bankrupt city has fallen on increasingly hard times recently , but last week it presented its first full road map for recovery , outlining an elaborate plan to restructure $ 18 billion in debt , demolish thousands of blighted homes and invest in the broken - down infrastructure that has made the city a symbol of urban decay			0
and the mayor @entity113 yesterday said that the ' strategic demolition ' of some fire - damaged vacant homes was to begin within 30 days			0
diversity : the theater was forced to branch out and started hosting ice hockey games , as well as concerts by the likes of @entity69 and @entity70 demolition : the building was closed and partially demolished in 1976 , but plans to completely tear it down had to be stopped due to the structural damage it would have caused adjoining buildings the announcement came at the start of @entity113 's first @entity130 address and the first such speech since @entity7 was allowed to enter bankruptcy			1
he said his administration and the @entity135 are both working to improve the city			0
' the change has started and the change in @entity7 is real , ' he said			2
@entity113 said the demolition will be paid for using $ 20 million in an unused escrow fund earmarked for burned houses			0
@entity55 is going through the largest municipal bankruptcy in @entity144 history , and @entity146 's address came less than a week after state - appointed emergency manager @entity147 filed his plan to pay creditors while providing money for city services and improvements in the coming years			2
in @entity7 's heyday it was the place where workers in a rising middle class flocked to factories to build the cars that changed @entity144 's way of life			1
last year however it was forced to file for bankruptcy			0
there are roughly 700,000 people who now live there - less than half the 1.8million who used to call the city home during the 1950s			0
for decades , @entity7 paid its bills by borrowing money while struggling to provide the most basic of services for its residents			1
the city is now getting a second chance in a federal bankruptcy court - led restructuring			0
@entity147 , @entity55 's state - appointed emergency manager , chose bankruptcy over diverting money from police , fire and other services to make debt payments			0
the move conserves cash so the city can operate , but it will hurt @entity55 's image for years			2
it will also leave creditors with much less than they are owed and places in jeopardy the pension benefits of thousands of city retirees			0
while the city 's auto industry decline is not the only reason for its troubles , the fall has certainly not helped			1
the city is littered with abandoned factories built in the postwar boom years , most of which have multiple stories			2
as the @entity209 auto invasion began cutting into @entity55 's sales , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and hundreds of auto parts companies looked outside the city to build one - story plants that could handle modern assembly lines			1
with every downturn , more companies abandoned the city , leaving the hulking buildings to squatters			2
@entity55 's tax base continued to erode			0
by the time the auto industry melted down in 2009 , only a few factories from @entity204 and @entity205 were left			0
@entity204 is the only one with headquarters in @entity7 , though it has huge research and testing centers with thousands of jobs outside the city .			2

the @entity13 , in @entity7 , was the city 's most grandiose theater when it was built in 1925
but it 's fortunes changed in the following decades and it was finally shut and partially demolished in 1976
it was only saved from being completely demolished because of the damage it would cause adjoining buildings
the site , build on top of @entity23 's first automobile workshop in 1925 , is now a car park
