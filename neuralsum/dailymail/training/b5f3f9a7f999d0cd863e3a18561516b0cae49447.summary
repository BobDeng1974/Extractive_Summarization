by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:19 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 2 may 2013 @entity3 plans to force freelance presenters back on to the employment books to end suspicions of tax avoidance have descended into chaos , it emerged last night , stars are being made to sign short - term contracts because the @entity3 has been unable to thrash out an acceptable way of paying them on a full time basis			2
the corporation decided to act following concerns from @entity16 about the corporation ’s use of so - called personal service companies as a way of channelling stars ’ earnings			2
stars are being made to sign short - term contracts because the @entity3 has been unable to thrash out an acceptable way of paying them on a full time basis in november , the @entity3 said it had identified 131 employees - either paid through service companies or on freelance deals - who would be asked to become staff members			1
but the corporation is struggling to come up with a way of enforcing its new rules			2
it is understood that the diverse and complicated ways many performers earn their money has made it incredibly difficult to come up with a single system that is fair			2
as a result , the corporation has ‘ extended ’ and ‘ continued ’ contracts , or in some cases issued new deals with clauses which admit it may have to be ‘ torn up ’			0
but even once the @entity3 has come up with a plan it then faces a battle with high profile stars who are likely to resist attempts to make them members of staff			0
last year after weeks of controversy the @entity3 admitted that the personal service company deals gave individuals a ‘ greater opportunity ’ to reduce their tax liability			0
stars such as @entity63 , left , and @entity64 , right , could be asked to become @entity3 employees speaking of the current problems in deciding who should go back on the @entity3 payroll , one influential agent described it as a ‘ complete debacle ’			1
they claimed the @entity3 was still trying to ‘ thrash out ’ by what criteria people should be put back on staff			0
presenter @entity76 has signed a nine month extension to his contract in november the @entity3 said a new ‘ employment test ’ , which determines whether a staff contract was appropriate , would be in place by april 2013			1
stars such as @entity64 and @entity63 , who said they were told to set up personal service companies by the @entity3 to get their salaries , could be among those asked to become employees			1
today programme presenter @entity76 , who is not paid through a service company but is a freelancer , has signed a nine - month extension to his contract			1
the short - length of the extension to his contract is thought to be linked to the deadlock over how the @entity3 pays its presenters			1
in future , @entity3 contracts will also contain clauses requiring employees to demonstrate that they are paying the appropriate level of tax			1
last year ’s review found that at least 124 top names earn £ 150,000 or more via the companies			0
a further 54 freelance stars got a similar amount			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ following a review last year , the @entity3 is changing the way it contracts with a small number of presenting and on air talent			0
while these changes are being finalised we need to extend some contracts that are due to be renewed for a short period of time			0
