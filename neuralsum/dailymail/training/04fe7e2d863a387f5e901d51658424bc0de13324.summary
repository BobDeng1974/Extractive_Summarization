it would seem to be the perfect getaway for @entity3 fans wanting to sample first - hand the sumptuous aristocratic lifestyle depicted in the hit drama			1
for the first time in its 172 - year history , @entity8 , where the series is filmed , is offering guests the chance to stay the night – for £ 500 a time			1
however , despite the wallet - busting fee , fans will not get to stay in the imposing 19th century stately home familiar to millions of @entity15 viewers , but in a remote gatehouse a mile down the road			1
cosy : the gateway house is a mile up the road from @entity8 , made famous on the @entity15 series nor will they get to sample lavish feasts served up by obliging , well - mannered below - stairs staff in the mould of fictional butler @entity24 – as the accommodation is strictly self - catering			1
@entity29 ’s owners , the @entity30 and @entity31 , have built the guest quarters in @entity33 , the castle ’s @entity35 - listed gatehouse , perched at the top of the mile - long driveway which leads to the famous front door			1
it was built by the first @entity41 in 1793 , but had been left disused for decades			1
now , after two years of restoration , it is expected to open this summer , with guests able to rent it for up to two nights			2
@entity31 told @entity47 : ‘ it ’s a new step for me			0
we will welcome people from all over , i expect			0
access is going to depend on the time of year			2
it will be cosy , charming and unique			0
a new step : @entity31 has opened the doors to the @entity29 gatehouse left disused for decades self - catered : guests paying £ 500 - a - night will not be treated to service like the show 's stars receive from @entity24 , mrs @entity59 and @entity60			1
their stay will be strictly self - catered , it has emerged ‘ it ’s exciting bringing back to life an old , sad building and again giving it purpose			1
it is a new departure for us to try short lets and we hope it will amuse people			0
‘ i hope to suggest some walks around various paths in the estate as well as suggesting local pubs			2
’ the castle is already immensely popular with visitors , particularly @entity78 , many of whom visit @entity81 specially to take in the stunning grounds			0
currently there is a long waiting list to marry there , with each wedding earning the estate £ 15,000			1
and @entity31 will , no doubt , encourage her overnight guests to head to the gift shop after they have signed the visitors ’ book			2
if guests want to get a glimpse of the opulent interior , they will have to book a wedding for £ 15,000 the @entity31 has revealed she will soon be releasing her third book about the house , a cookbook called dining at @entity8 : the @entity99			1
recipes , etiquette and anecdotes			0
‘ i ’m hard at work so we can rush it out for the @entity108 market , ’ she said			0
@entity31 and her husband @entity109 were burdened by the high expense of running a stately home before their friend @entity112 wrote the series , with @entity29 in mind , for @entity15 in 2010			0
reports at the time suggested £ 1.8 million of urgent repairs were needed to keep @entity29 going after it had been ravaged by damp and rot			2
at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair			0
@entity31 added : ‘ @entity3 has helped our marketing in an extraordinary way and has meant we have been able to tackle various projects earlier than otherwise because of the increased tours and visitors			0
and i suspect the effects from @entity3 will still roll out over the next 20 years			0

first offer for guests to stay in 172 - year history of @entity8
but fans paying £ 500 - a - night will be a mile away from famous estate
accommodation is self - catered in gatehouse left disused for decades
