by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:55 est , 20 december 2012 a @entity1 has given her family 12 unexpected early @entity4 presents			2
three - year - old @entity5 started giving birth at the home of her ‘ auntie ’ , @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10			1
but neither she , nor @entity5 ’s owner @entity11 , had known she was pregnant			1
' i could n’t believe it , ' said ms @entity8 , who was looking after @entity5 for a short time			1
' she just came up to me trying to get my attention and then suddenly a pup appeared			0
then they just kept coming and coming			0
' @entity5 the three - year - old labrador looks as mystified as anyone as the 12 black pups suckle up to her at home in @entity9 , @entity10			1
a @entity22 she was left alone with appears to be the prime suspect @entity5 's family had not even realised she was pregnant when she went into labour neighbours and friends have taken turns in bottle feeding them and in a freak twist , all 12 were born on the 12th of the 12th 2012			1
' it was such a coincidence , and we have managed to keep them all alive and healthy			0
' looking after the pups has been a full - time job for ms @entity8 , her neighbours and friends , including @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , who have taken turns in bottle feeding them			2
and her 12 puppies made a timely appearance , all being born on 12/12/12 ' i would like to give a massive thank you to everyone who has helped me , because without them , these dogs would not be alive , ' she said			2
it is thought @entity5 fell pregnant when she was left alone with another dog in the family , @entity55 , who is 18 - months - old			1
the family had booked @entity5 in for an appointment to be neutered , but the pups arrived too soon			1
' we thought @entity55 was too young to be able to do anything			0
but obviously he was n’t and we know that now			0
' i would definitely advise other dog owners to get their pets neutered when they are as young as possible			0
' the puppies are lovely but it has been a lot of hard work and quite expensive to look after them			0
' ms @entity8 will look after the pups and keep them with their mother until they are eight - weeks - old , after which she will find homes for them .			0

the pups were all born on 12/12/12
@entity5 's family had been *planing* to have her neutered
the pups are so tiny they are being fed with bottles
