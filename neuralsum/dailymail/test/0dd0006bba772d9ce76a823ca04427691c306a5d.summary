a grandfather who could n't afford his own cruiser has come up with an innovative solution - putting his caravan on a boat and taking it out on the water			1
@entity6 , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ' catamavan ' , out on the @entity8 in @entity9 regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside			1
he says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising , and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so two years ago he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his recent divorce			1
bizarre : this ' catamavan ' , a cross between a boat and a caravan , has been spotted on the @entity8 in @entity9 the catamavan has an oven , fridge freezer , shower , toilet , double bed and two tables , and it is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots			1
hundreds of two - litre bottles fill the twin hulls , so the boat wo n't sink even if it gets a hole as he travels up and down the same stretch of river			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i wanted something that had a nice , stable platform and was really comfortable because all my boats are quite cramped			0
' i 've got a number of yachts and if you have ever been in a yacht you will know that you can never see out the window			0
project : @entity6 started building the unusual vessel while he was doing through a divorce ' in the @entity49 you get lovely nights and mornings but sometimes it 's a bit cold to sit outside and have a meal so you eat below deck and do n't get any views			1
' i could n't afford a cabin cruiser , the sort of thing you need to have big windows and eat outside , so this was a better alternative because i did n't have to spend so much money and i could make it whatever size i wanted			0
' i sleep on it regularly during the summer but in the winter it 's quite cold , although i do check on it regularly			0
' @entity6 says he spent around Â£ 4,000 building the hull and added : ' most of it was done flat pack at home			2
' then i took the catamaran down to the ship yard and we lifted the caravan onto it			2
' it is not intended to go fast and it only has a small engine but it still goes about four knots			0
' i also did it because when i was down at the harbour all day working on my boats it would give me somewhere to stay the night			0
' you are allowed to anchor anywhere along the @entity8 unless it is a restricted area and there 's nothing wrong in what i 've done			2
' the father of four keeps the catamaran anchored in @entity95 , @entity9 , which is 19 miles away from his home in @entity97			1
mr @entity6 said he started his project after the break - up of his marriage and began building the boat in his front garden before moving it to a local boatyard			2
' i started building it as a bit of a distraction really , ' he said			1
' it gave me something to focus on because things were n't going well back home			0
home : the catamavan cruises up and down the @entity8 in @entity9 , near mr @entity6 's home ' i used to build paragliders and para-motors and i have always worked on boats , but i wanted to do something a bit different			1
' a spokesman for the @entity122 and @entity121 said it was unclear whether or not the vessel is legal , but added that it appears to be seaworthy			0
she said that officials would only investigate mr @entity6 if they receive an official complaint .			0

@entity129 started building the bizarre vessel while getting divorced

the 80 - year - old enjoys cruising up and down the @entity8 in @entity9
