the impressive tale of two children in @entity2 , @entity3 , who spent nearly all the 1980s creating a shot - by - shot remake of @entity7 ’s @entity6 might soon be made into a film			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were both just 11 years old when they began their ambitious venture in 1982			1
after years of filming in backyards and garages with homemade and often dangerous special effects , they completed their adaptation in 1989			2
a book has already been written about the making of @entity6 : the adaptation and now the producer of another cult phenomenon - @entity23 , the man behind @entity25 - has optioned it for a film			1
deadline reports that after the two men premiered their impressive film when they were 18 , it went on a shelf and was all but forgotten			1
their friends and family remained impressed with the special effects the two were capable of producing with little more than their own ingenuity , but their star turn ended there			0
that is until filmmaker @entity53 managed to get his hands on a tape of the fan film and showed it before a live and deeply impressed audience in 2002			1
watch the full movie on youtube shot - by - shot : starting at age 11 , the boys filmed death defying stunts in their @entity3 backyards and garages			0
at 18 , their movie was done brave : here , the actual scene in @entity6 where @entity71 clings for dear life to a car			2
@entity9 and @entity10 filmed their version without the aid of stunt doubles or driver 's licenses short - lived : despite their impressive ingenuity and knack for creating special effects on a budget of zero , their film debuted and quickly faded away shockingly similar : this gory scene was one of many that were so lovingly adapted by @entity9 and @entity10 , though their version flipped this particular moment raiders ! but after filmmaker @entity53 saw the movie by a stroke of luck and showed it to impressed audience , it became so popular that a book about its creation was written by @entity99 with only 1980s level technology and on no budget , @entity9 and @entity10 managed to create what has now been dubbed the greatest fan film ever made			1
with the help of its handmade , paper replica of the original film ’s trademark killer boulder , their movie became something of a cult phenomenon			0
‘ i thought the movie was an urban myth but when i saw it , from a filmmaker perspective it was more inspiring than any movie i ’d ever seen , ’ @entity23 told @entity113			0
@entity23 ’s favorite part of the story is when one of the kids - seven were involved at one time or another - learned about special effects and did a mold of @entity9 ’s face			2
but instead of special effects plaster , they used construction plaster which heats up and becomes very hard as it cures			0
unable to speak or hear , @entity9 was rushed to the emergency room where doctors finally removed the plaster with a cast saw			2
@entity23 has purchased the rights to the aptly named book about the saga , @entity91 ! the @entity138 , and plans to turn it into a film			2
for that to happen , he says he ’ll likely have to get permission from two very famous men behind the original @entity71 film : @entity7 and @entity144			0
video source @entity145 iconic : in one of the most famous scenes , @entity10 re-enacts @entity71 replacing a priceless relic before a booby trap springs not bad ! few scene typify @entity153 's turn as @entity71 like this one			0
and true to form , the boys from @entity3 gave mimicking it shot - by - shot their best shot it could happen : even @entity7 himself is a professed fan , though movie rights and the blessing of @entity144 still stand in the way of @entity91 ! the movie not surprisingly , both @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 went on to indulge their love of film making with careers in entertainment @entity7 appears to support the project - he ’s already confessed he ’s a fan of the ode to his movie			1
@entity144 ’s take on it remains unknown			0
but enthusiasm for the film is high			0
and regardless of whether or not it ever gets made , just the possibility will be enough to shine more light on @entity9 and @entity10 ’s backyard masterpiece .			1

@entity9 and @entity10 were just 11 years old when the began making @entity6 : the adaptation
