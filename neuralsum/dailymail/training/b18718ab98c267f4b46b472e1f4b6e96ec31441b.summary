by @entity0 @entity1 capitulated in spectacular fashion after lunch to fall to a humiliating 95 - run defeat at @entity5 that leaves captain @entity7 ’s future in grave doubt			1
@entity7 ’s team lost six wickets for 50 runs either side of lunch to be bowled out for 223 in one of the most embarrassing displays of his increasingly disastrous spell in charge			0
@entity1 have now lost seven of their last 10 tests and have not won in that period			0
it is their worst run in 21 years			0
the @entity1 captain , whose batting form has also collapsed , was badly let down by his batsmen again after lunch on day five of the second @entity27 following a promising morning session which @entity29 and @entity30 so nearly negotiated safely			1
@entity46 , who may have played his last test for @entity1 , was the first to fall when he hooked @entity35 to deep square leg where @entity48 took the catch to reduce the hosts to 198 for six , chasing 319			1
@entity37 completed a miserable test with the bat moments later when he also hooked @entity35 into the deep to record a pair and leave @entity1 on the brink			2
@entity30 had batted superbly to reach 66 but with his partners committing the equivalent of cricketing suicide up the other end , the @entity75 also fell for @entity35 ’s sucker punch by hooking to @entity54 at backward square leg , handing the @entity83 fast bowler his seventh wicket			2
@entity85 was the last man out when he was run out cheaply in embarrassing fashion that summed up @entity1 ’s woeful recent performances			0
@entity88 salutes ' memorable ' @entity59 's win the end is nigh : @entity91 tickles one down the leg side for another limp dismissal down and out : @entity85 ( celntre ) is run out in a farcical manner and @entity1 lose the second test giving it short shrift : @entity30 pulls the ball to the boundary before @entity1 's collapse bounced out : @entity29 was dismissed with the last ball before lunch at @entity5 the long walk : @entity29 trudges off after being dismissed by @entity35 with the last ball before lunch halfway there : @entity30 salutes his 50 on a good morning for @entity1 on the front foot : @entity30 drives the ball to the boundary during a positive morning session for @entity1 going well : @entity30 and @entity29 touch gloves as their partnership reaches 100 spirit of cricket : exiled @entity1 batsman @entity115 sent this cryptic tweet after @entity1 's loss			1
