idea : health secretary @entity1 will announce the setting up of new body @entity3 every elderly patient with a long - term health condition will be assigned a doctor or nurse to track their care through the @entity11 , @entity1 will announce today			1
the health secretary wants a named clinician to be responsible for overseeing the treatment of vulnerable pensioners while they are out of hospital – whether they live at home or in residential care			1
it will mean that from next year , older people and their families will always know who to contact when they have a question about their treatment			1
at present , many feel they are passed from pillar to post and never speak to anyone who fully understands their situation			1
mr @entity1 will say that just as a consultant is in charge of a patient ’s care in hospital , so a gp , community doctor or nurse should be put in charge of an older person ’s care out of hospital			1
this will mean that every element of their treatment is tailored around their needs whether they have one , two , three or more long - term conditions , or are trying to settle back at home after a fall			2
long - term conditions could be those needing treatment with courses of drugs or regular tests at hospital or a local surgery			1
it should mean over- 65s who suffer from conditions such as asthma , diabetes , kidney disease or angina receive better care			0
knowing how to contact : mr @entity1 wants a named clinician to be responsible for overseeing the treatment of vulnerable pensioners while they are out of hospital - whether they live at home or in residential care local @entity11 bodies will decide which clinician should be given the responsibility of dealing with a patient			1
it could be the patient ’s gp but in many cases , they will not be the best person because a patient may be dealing with doctors in hospitals more often			2
the health secretary has told @entity87 to have named clinicians in place from next april			0
mr @entity1 will say : ‘ the challenge today is to provide integrated , coordinated out - of - hospital care , something where the @entity11 , with our tradition of family doctors and primary care , could lead the world			1
‘ but to do that we need to know that there is a clinician accountable for vulnerable older people in the community just as there is a consultant responsible for them in hospital			1
' as a member of the public i would like that to be my gp – but whoever it is they should be named so that patients , families and carers all know where the buck stops			0
‘ we are proposing to ask @entity87 to make sure there is a named clinician responsible for every vulnerable older person whether or not they are in hospital			1
’ mr @entity1 will make the announcement as the @entity11 celebrates its 65th anniversary today			2
but he will also take time to explain why it needs to change with the times			0
treatment : the plan should mean over- 65s who suffer from conditions such as asthma , diabetes , kidney disease or angina receive better care he will say : ‘ as we celebrate , we also reflect			2
the world today is very different to 1948			0
the old model was curable illnesses where you were sent into hospital unwell and came out better			0
‘ yet most people now leave hospital with long - term conditions which need to be supported and managed at home			2
‘ fully one - quarter of the population now has a chronic condition ... all of whom need radically different models of care to what the @entity11 has been accustomed to			0
’ ' the world today is very different to 1948			0
the old model was curable illnesses where you were sent into hospital unwell and came out better ' health secretary @entity1 mr @entity1 will also announce the setting up of a new body , @entity3			1
by december , @entity162 will be the first country in the world to sequence the genomes of up to 100,000 patients within five years , to improve our understanding of disease and to design treatments better tailored to individuals			0
it comes as mr @entity1 reiterated his support for the abortion limit to be cut to 12 weeks , saying in an interview with @entity176 magazine @entity175 that if there is a free vote on the issue in the coming years , ‘ i will always vote with my conscience ’			2
he added : ‘ but as secretary of state i will implement whatever it is @entity182 decides on , even if it ’s not what i personally believe			0
’ and he agreed with crossbencher @entity184 who last week called for the @entity185 to have a name change , because it sounded like a ‘ one - way ticket ’ to death			0
‘ i think that is quite a good point , ’ he said .			0
