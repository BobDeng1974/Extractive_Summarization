for those hoping that a decent rugby game had arrived , think again			1
for @entity3 ’s @entity2 takes all fans ’ wishes and boots them firmly into touch			2
a lot of this is down to fundamental flaws in its gameplay			2
looking past the shoddy animation and terrible character models , the @entity13 just ca n’t understand formation			1
not fun : although these screens look promising , in action , the game does n't capture the sport very well this effectively takes away any sort of structured attack – resulting in most matches looking like a blend of hot potato and playground favourite ‘ it ’			1
passing is clunky and unresponsive – a quick tap firing the ball the length of the pitch one minute or an ineffective pop pass the next			1
at the breakdown , it ’s nearly impossible to use your backs given how fast ( and offside ) the other team close you down and the ref will almost always get in the way			2
defence is not much better			0
simply putting the controller down is almost as effective as playing			0
the @entity13 will tackle anything that moves , while the clunky battle at the breakdown does n’t really take into account team momentum			1
when playing against the computer , rarely does the opposition ’s scrum - half manage to pass it wide , opting mostly to charge in himself			0
then there are the set pieces – which are some of the most boring yet in the genre			1
scrums involve pushing two thumbsticks the direction you want your team to push			0
and kicking and line - outs are a case of timed presses when at the correct point on a metre			0
not only that , but there are a complete lack of set - plays , so any tactics go out of the window			1
you ’re also constrained to using a behind - the - action camera view			0
although it gives you the choice of a sideline and closer - to - the - action camera , both are nigh on unplayable			0
the best thing about this game are the graphics , but even these fall well short			1
given the attempted tv - style presentation during matches , it ’s hard to avoid the shoddy , gormless character models that plague each cutscene			2
boring : scrums and other set pieces are cumbersome and the lack of set plays does nothing to help matters equally poor is the game ’s commentary			1
with the likes of @entity98 and all black legend @entity99 at the helm , it ’s a shame that it just does n’t work			0
both are equally annoying , and chime in with observations that rarely have anything to do with what ’s going on			0
‘ i agree ’ is as far as interaction between the two go and the historical facts @entity98 treats you to before each match are equally as stilted			0
all of the above obliterate any sort of redeeming qualities the game features – be that a large selection of licensed teams , varied game modes ( including the @entity116 tour ) and character customisation			1
the long wait for a decent rugby game continues			2
let us know what you think on @entity124 : @ @entity125 and on @entity126 : @entity127 .			0

does n't feel like rugby , with its shoddy running lines and ai
poor graphics and *laughable* commentary
lack of set plays , clunky passing , *bad* animation
lots of teams , customisation and *challenges* , including @entity116 tour
