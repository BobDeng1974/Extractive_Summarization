by @entity0 published : 16:07 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 16:15 est , 30 january 2014 researchers have created the ultimate beer taster - a robot tongue so sensitive it can distinguish between different varieties and even check alcohol content			1
the @entity8 team say their ' robo - tongue ' is the first to be able to spot its favourite tipple - and could find a job in the quality control areas of brewers			2
the team used 21 sensors in their robo - tongue , and trained it to distinguish between @entity17 , lager , double malt , @entity20 , @entity21 and low - alcohol			1
the end of the bad pint : the robo - tongue can tell if a pint tastes as it should , and has the right alcohol content some scientists claim beer - not bread - is the reason early man adopted a society based on farming around 10,000 years ago , a key moment in our evolution			1
the cultivation of grain saw the transition away from a hunter - gatherer lifestyle and a widely - accepted theory is that the crops were used to bake bread , but experts claim it was the prospect of a brew that drove the desire to settle down and start a farm			2
researchers say beer has a number of advantages beyond the intoxicating effects and taste , such as a high b vitamin content , the essential amino acid lysine and the fact it was safer to drink than water as the brewing process killed off bacteria and viruses			2
the discovery , published in the journal ' @entity64 ' , is accurate in almost 82 % of cases			0
beer is the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world			2
now , scientists at the @entity70 have led a study which analysed several brands of beer by applying a new concept in analysis systems , known as an electronic tongue , the idea for which is based on the human sense of taste			0
' the concept of the electronic tongue consists in using a generic array of sensors , in other words with generic response to the various chemical compounds involved , which generate a varied spectrum of information with advanced tools for processing , pattern recognition and even artificial neural networks , ' said @entity93 , the main author of the study			0
the array of sensors was formed of 21 ion - selective electrodes , including some with response to cations ( ammonium , sodium ) , others with response to anions ( nitrate , chloride , etc. ) , as well as electrodes with generic ( unspecified ) response to the varieties considered			1
the electronic beer tester : @entity8 researchers have managed to distinguish between different varieties of beer using an electronic tongue			1
the discovery , published in the journal ' @entity64 ' , is accurate in almost 82 percent of cases			0
the machine then ' learnt ' to taste the different varieties			0
' using more powerful tools â € “ supervised learning â € “ and linear discriminant analysis did enable us to distinguish between the main categories of beer we studied : @entity17 , lager , double malt , @entity20 , @entity21 and low - alcohol , ' @entity118 said			1
the study concluded that these tools could one day give robots a sense of taste , and even supplant panels of tasters in the food industry to improve the quality and reliability of products for consumption			0
the breakthrough is expected to be used by the brewing industry to supplement human beer tasters			0

system uses 21 sensors to analyse different *liquids*
researchers trained it to trained it to distinguish between @entity17 , lager , double malt , @entity20 , @entity21 and low - alcohol
can also check the beer has the correct alcohol level
