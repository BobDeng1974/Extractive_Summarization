by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 12 july 2012 a man made daytime television history by discussing penis enlargement surgery on @entity6 's @entity5			1
interviewed by @entity7 and @entity8 in a pre-recorded segment to protect his identity , the anonymous figure revealed how he had paid £ 5,000 to have fat removed from his love handles and injected along the shaft of his manhood to increase its girth			2
breaking new ground for pre-watershed viewing , this nine - minute feature peaked when before - and - after photos flashed up on screen ; no doubt to cackles of laughter in the production office and across the country			2
crusade : a man known only as ' @entity30 ' appeared on this morning to talk about his penoplasty ( penis enlargement ) operation in the hope that it would help stop what he calls society 's ' toxic ' attitude towards penis size a penis ? on show ? let 's point and laugh			1
that 's what they 're there for			2
but it was n't the difference in this man 's penis size that impressed me			1
although he 'd certainly got what he 'd paid for courtesy of @entity56 's dr @entity55 , i was more amazed that this brave chap - who actually had a perfectly good penis to start with - had coined a phrase to describe an illness that so many men suffer from : penile dysmorphia			1
and , given that we 're now in 2012 , it needs to stop			2
borrowing terminology from body dysmorphia , which sees patients clinically pre-occupied with a non-existent physical fault in themselves , this ordinary bloke with his back to the camera had summed up an endemic problem with two words and given the burgeoning men 's movement , as well as his body , a boost			1
as a fellow men 's rights activist , i salute him			2
he had n't undergone surgery for vanity or to out - do his mates in the changing room			2
why would he ? none of them care			2
nor had he done it to correct a medical problem which was blighting his life ( one that would n't have been taken seriously , even if he had )			2
ashamed : the man chose to remain anonymous , his identity protected by a wig , for fear of ridicule in a society he says mocks men unfairly for their penis size instead , he was simply trying to undo years of ' toxic messages from women and the media ' , which had left him psychologically scarred			1
the very messages which affect all males , from young boys to war veterans			2
it was this - not the gory footage of the operation - which brought a tear to my eye			0
namely because he stood up for the basic dignity of all men , including me , the bloke next door and the latest guy being drafted to serve in the @entity118			0
by coining the term penile dysmorphia , he has summed up an endemic problem with two words and given the burgeoning men 's movement , as well as his body , a boost			1
thanks to this person 's willingness to speak up and not show off , men have finally been given the terminology to describe a shame they 're taught to harbour from childhood			0
a sexism that comes regardless of what a man 's penis might look like ; but simply because he has one in the first place			1
they are always too small , too thin or just plain ugly , irrespective of how they actually are			0
young boys are still told that size matters , while girls are counselled over size zero models in magazines			1
women scorn the fashion industry for putting pressure on their sisters ( and they 're right to ) , but it 's these very women who often trash a guy because his body is n't to their liking			1
even though his body is his , not theirs			0
in demand : dr @entity55 performs four to five penoplasty operations every week , costing £ 3,000 for a girth increase and £ 3,500 for a boost in length rarely is the defining part of a man 's body respected for simply being the amazing , multi-functional , life - creating organ it actually is			0
yet , despite such messages creating generation after generation of men and boys who suffer in silence , they are constantly regurgitated			0
and , although i run the risk of sounding like the male equivalent of @entity175 , it 's women who are mostly to blame			1
as a man with many close female friends and many women in my immediate family - women who are often smart , successful and emotionally intelligent - i can honestly say that 90 per cent of them have offended me at some point by mocking another guy 's penis			1
i love my sister - in - laws , but they 've done it			0
as have the wives of my best friends			0
so too have celebrities i 've interviewed for magazines , one of my former female bosses and , perhaps most disturbingly , clever women who have young sons , loving husbands and fathers who deserve better			1
i was once at a friend 's 21st birthday party , which was festooned with pictures of him at various stages in his life ; including some as a child in the bath			0
even here , while celebrating his passage into adulthood , there were women whom i overheard say : ' hmm , he has n't changed much ... if you know what i mean			1
' another time , during a man 's speech about prostate cancer at a major health seminar in @entity215 , two women in the row ahead of me leaned in to each other and made an inch gesture between their thumb and forefinger			1
both times , my heart sank - not for me or my body			0
comparatively , i 've never once heard any of the men in my life subject their girlfriends to the same humiliation and paranoia			0
but can we really blame women ? yes			1
and they need to take responsibility for their words			0
but it 's also right to point the finger at the media			1
whether it manifests in a @entity242 album track ( there are two which do this - charming , i know ) or one of the countless female characters in film and tv who take great delight in belittling men over the penis - a kick in the crotch or a wiggle of their little finger - it 's offensive to all men ; the overwhelming majority of whom are good , good people			1
likewise , if a presenter like @entity263 rated women on the tautness of their vagina ( which , fyi , varies as much as men 's genitalia ) like certain loose women , there would be an outrage			1
but , sorry girls , it 's no different when the victims are male			0
to make matters worse , there are virtually no positive or neutral messages about this wonderful part of the human body to counteract the above			0
and it has a knock - on affect for every other men 's issue , from self - esteem and sexual health to male genital mutilation , otherwise known as domestic abuse			0
recently , a woman was arrested in the @entity289 for allegedly drugging her husband , restraining him , cutting off his penis and destroying it in a garbage disposal ; all because he asked for a divorce			2
the response ? @entity295 declared on live tv that it was ' quite fabulous '			0
unsurprisingly , she kept her job , which is funny given what @entity299 was fired for			0
perhaps this would n't have happened if men demanded more respect for their penises			0
feminist author @entity305 once said that fat was a feminist issue			0
i suspect she 's right , but if she is , then penis size is an issue of the same scale for men			1
thanks to the gentleman on this @entity5 's sofa today , my faith in u-turning this has been somewhat restored ; namely because the people who judge the size of his penis might pay more attention to the size of their brains			1
after all , not only did he have the courage to be honest about his most private body part on national tv , he also had the balls to tackle male sexism head - on			0
