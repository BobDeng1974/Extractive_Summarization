@entity0 encapsulates all the values rugby union ’s marketing people love to espouse			1
fiercely loyal , brave beyond words , strong and dedicated			0
at @entity5 , who take on @entity7 in @entity8 on sunday in the @entity10 quarter - final , the flanker is loved by his team - mates every bit as much as he is loathed by opponents who fear the reckless abandon with which he is prepared to play the game			1
with a face left battered and bruised by years of punishment , @entity0 is the man you want on your team			1
‘ i change into something else when i play rugby , my personality changes , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when i step off the pitch i will be somebody else again			2
you go out there and do your job then you step off and pick up your kids and you are soft again			0
when it is time to go , there is a switch that turns you on for a big match			0
@entity5 ace @entity0 looks to get to grips with @entity35 @entity34 @entity36 tackles @entity35 ace @entity37 in the @entity39 match ‘ my dad always says he does n’t want to die a healthy man			1
i do n’t want to go down healthy			0
hopefully there ’ll be a bit of wear and tear			2
i ’m happy to crack on and give 100 per cent every time i get the opportunity			0
’ therein lies the challenge facing rugby today			2
for all we love about these young men who risk serious injury every week in order to entertain us , are the risks becoming too great ? @entity5 director of rugby @entity55 described @entity0 as ‘ unique among rugby players ’ , praising his willingness to ignore risks to his own wellbeing			1
@entity0 and @entity62 of @entity5 tackle @entity61 of @entity63 @entity0 bursts through to score a try during the @entity39 match between @entity5 and @entity35 his continued presence on a rugby field is something of a miracle after undergoing pioneering knee surgery in @entity71 more than three years ago which a @entity73 specialist refused to carry out because he considered it too extreme			1
at the very least he will need a full knee replacement in the not - too - distant future			2
‘ i feel massively blessed , ’ said the 31 - year - old @entity78 farmer ’s son from @entity79			1
‘ i never thought i ’d have come back and played so many games after the surgery			0
i went through a lot of pain			0
‘ the physio says i ’m a bit like @entity86			2
i ’m going back in time and healing up again			0
i will probably regret it after rugby when i ’m sitting at home having to do some work			0
but that ’s for the future			0
i ’ll worry about that when i get there			0
’ @entity95 is tackled by @entity0 and @entity96 during the @entity98 semi final but while he can be very cavalier with his own body , @entity0 believes players do need to be protected from themselves at times			1
‘ it is annoying for players sometimes because you want to crack on and keep playing			2
but players ’ health after rugby has to be the no 1 priority because it is such a short amount of rugby you play in your life			1
’ the 31 - year - old will run out against @entity7 on sunday off the back of a performance against @entity35 at @entity113 last saturday that @entity55 believes was his best since the astonishing man - of - the - match display he produced against @entity63 in last year ’s @entity117 semi-final			1
‘ it ’s going to take a big game to bring it home , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the @entity117 knockout stages is when you get tested			0
that ’s when some guys become stars and i ’m up for that			0
