if prescribed , the once - a - day tablet , called ibrutinib , could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy			1
@entity17 is one of only a handful of new medicines to be made available via the @entity21 after two trials in 28 @entity24 hospitals showed it to be extremely effective in treating both mantle cell lymphoma ( mcl ) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( @entity28 )			1
professor @entity29 , consultant haematologist at @entity30 in @entity31 , says it is a new class of targeted medications , known as a @entity35 ’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor			0
it works by targeting and switching off a protein in the cancer cells			0
‘ chemotherapy kills cancer cells but it also kills normal cells and therefore has lots of side effects , ’ he says			2
‘ as this drug is targeted at the b - cells , the side effects are minor			0
in addition , patients do n’t have to go into hospital to have it administered			2
’ about one in every 25 people will be diagnosed with blood cancer during their lifetime – that ’s 25,000 people each year in the @entity24			1
of these , 2,800 will have @entity28 , the most common type of leukaemia , and 500 will have @entity58 , a rare type of b - cell lymphoma			1
for the time being , a course of ibrutinib – which costs up to £ 74,000 a year – will be prescribed only to patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy , or those who have relapsed following chemotherapy			1
but trials using the drug as a first - line treatment are also taking place			2
prof @entity29 says : ‘ we ’re looking forward to a chemotherapy - free future , although we ’re not there quite yet			0
‘ this drug takes on an aggressive disease and makes it benign			0
it ’s not a cure – these diseases are incurable – but it turns them into chronic conditions			0
we already know that it can work for several years … the challenge to the @entity86 is cost			0
’ if prescribed , the once - a - day tablet could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy			1
