by @entity1 reporter published : 11:59 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 7 september 2013 prison officials have been criticised for wasting money and resources on organising a motorised mercy dash in a prison escort vehicle so that a sick guinea pig could get treatment from a vet			1
the guinea pig , named @entity10 , was whisked to the vets after he fell ill with an ear infection			1
following treatment he was returned to @entity13 , at @entity14 , to be reunited with his brother @entity15 , but within two hours he had died			1
the guinea pigs were kept to help rehabilitate female criminals			1
really ? prison officials have been criticised after spending money on a mercy dash - for a guinea pig an unnamed prison nurse , from @entity23 , has criticised the jail , claiming @entity10 was accompanied to the vet by a prison officer in the prison escort vehicle			1
and she says two vets were subsequently called to the prison to certify @entity10 's death , which was later logged on the prison computer as a death in custody			2
' i think it is such a joke that a guinea pig was taken to the vets by prison service car			2
it took an officer off duty and we are already short staffed , ' she told the @entity43			0
' then later that day a member of staff logged that there was a death in custody			0
but unbelievably it was the guinea pig			2
' two vets arrived at 7.45pm to confirm that the guinea pig was dead			0
in my opinion , this is such a scandalous waste of public funds			0
' these guinea pigs have been living it up for sometime			1
they are even on the roll check along with inmates meaning they get checked on four times a day for their welfare			0
' scene : @entity13 in @entity61 , where staff put maximum effort into saving the life of a guinea pig expense : the prison van rushed the guinea pig to the vets , then back again , but it still died the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) confirmed that @entity10 the guinea pig was taken to see a vet in a prison vehicle , although he was otherwise unaccompanied			1
a spokeswoman said that a subsequent visit to the prison by the vet later the same day , when death was certified , was made on his way home , and for no fee			0
the @entity68 also dismissed claims that the animal was officially logged as having died in custody on the prison computer system			0
she said that the guinea pig was looked after and checked on regularly in the same way as any animal would have to be when kept as a pet			0
a brief @entity68 statement added : ' a small number of donated animals are kept at @entity13 to help with the rehabilitation of prisoners			2

returned after treatment to @entity13 , but two hours later died
he is *survived* by his brother - @entity10
guinea pigs were used to ' help rehabilitate female criminals
