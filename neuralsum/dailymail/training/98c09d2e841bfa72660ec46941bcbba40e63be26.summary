such was @entity2 ’s desperation to win his first @entity3 since 2011 , he lost			1
with half an hour remaining and a fiery contest goalless , he turned to a 17 - year - old @entity5 playing for the first time in the fixture			0
@entity8 was the romance card			0
still without score some 15 minutes later , he gambled			0
off came midfield enforcer @entity12 to be replaced by @entity13 , the half - fit striker who only needs half a chance to score a goal			1
he got one and missed			0
@entity17 manager @entity2 has not taken a single point from his last four meetings with @entity20 @entity20 winger @entity21 scored a late goal to seal a 1 - 0 win against rivals @entity17 @entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring the dramatic winner against @entity2 's side then came the @entity27 , £ 12million flop @entity29 was introduced as @entity2 played his final hand			1
within two minutes it was @entity20 having the last laugh , exposing gaping holes in @entity17 ’s midfield to break with unforgiving efficiency			1
@entity21 was the match - winner and , for the first time in derby history , a @entity17 manager had lost four on the bounce			1
the withdrawal of @entity12 afforded @entity21 the space to exploit			1
@entity20 head coach @entity43 knew as much , but was too canny to gloat			1
‘ i think @entity2 was brave , very , very brave , ’ said the @entity44			1
‘ he put on as many strikers as he could to win the game and for 10 or 15 minutes , they gave us plenty of problems			1
‘ it was a very good and brave move from @entity2			1
now because of that , we were able to break and score the goal			0
with the game goalless and @entity2 desperate for a winner , @entity43 's men capitalsed on some questionable managerial decisions from his opposite number @entity43 celebrates emphatically following @entity21 's late goal against local rivals @entity17 at @entity61 @entity21 raises his arms in victory in front of the travelling @entity20 supporters at @entity61 ‘ it 's unfair , but sometimes in football that happens			1
you put plenty of forward players on and you win it 2 - 0 or 3 - 0 , or it can go the other way			2
’ there had , in fairness , been chances to win it for the hosts – @entity8 shot when he should have crossed to the unmarked @entity78 and @entity79 was thwarted by @entity80			2
@entity2 even started one move himself with a half - volley down the touchline in an attempt to hurry a throw - in , but the efforts of he and his team were to end in despair , again			2
the @entity17 boss admits it was a case of misadventure			1
‘ we were always liable to overcommit , ’ he said			0
‘ if we had one fault it was overcommitting in the end period of the game where you have to be disciplined , particularly given the history of this fixture where @entity20 have caught us on the break before and they have done it again			1
’ he did , though , defend the motivation behind the changes			0
@entity2 called upon 17 - year - old @entity8 to play for the first time in the notoriously feisty fixture the @entity106 manager also brought off midfield custodian @entity12 to bring on striker @entity13 ‘ this club wants to see goals and i would never be manager here and accept a draw at home , ’ he said			1
‘ we should still have the discipline in the team regardless of how many offensive players we have on			0
‘ if ever we were going to lose a game then do it in that manner , trying to push for a win			2
as much as we tried to , we just could n’t get the goal			0
’ @entity120 , meanwhile , would be the best way to describe @entity123 ’s headed clearance from the goal - line in the second half which kept the game level but was at the expense of a bloodied cheek when he clattered into the post			0
‘ @entity123 is hurting physically and mentally , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ he had a couple of stitches but he ’ll be okay			0
’ after three defeats in eight days , will @entity17 be okay ? next up is a trip to @entity135 on @entity136			2
‘ this compounds the defeats at @entity139 and @entity140			0
we have to lick our wounds and prepare quickly for @entity135 , ’ added @entity2			2
‘ we ’re still in a healthy position in the league			0
‘ it ’s painful but this disappointment is different to what it felt like earlier in the season – you can see that our players gave everything			0
’ in giving everything , however , they ended up with nothing .			0
