by @entity1 reporter published : 16:51 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 17:42 est , 7 january 2014 deaths from cancer in @entity5 have declined continually over the last 20 years , mostly thanks to adults quitting smoking , earlier diagnosis and better treatment , according new research			1
the @entity12 's annual report , published on tuesday , show the death rate from the disease fell 20 percent between 1991 to 2010 , the latest year for which data is available			0
but the research also projects that a total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 deaths from the disease will occur in the @entity5 this year			1
that 's around 1,604 deaths per day			1
quitting pays off : ' a big part of this decrease in mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking , ' said dr @entity28 of @entity30 's @entity29 dr @entity28 , chief of medical oncology at @entity30 's @entity29 , explained to @entity32 that the decline in smoking is a major factor for the lower cancer death rates			1
' a big part of this decrease in mortality is certainly linked to the decrease in cigarette smoking because we know that lung cancer is such a lethal disease that once you have it , very often you will die of it , ' oh told @entity32			1
lung cancer rates began falling in the mid- 1980s in men and in the late 1990s in women			1
according to the report , these ' differences reflect historical patterns in tobacco use , where women began smoking in large numbers about 20 years later than men			0
' the research confirms that lung cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer deaths is due to that disease			0
combined with lung cancer , colon , prostate , and breast cancers are responsible for almost half of all the deaths for both men and women			1
@entity67 : human breast cancer cells dividing			0
even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29 % of the new cancer cases in women in 2014 dr @entity28 said that patients are being diagnosed sooner and cancer treatments are getting better			1
but the disease continues to survive medical attempts to completely wipe it out			0
' one of the key issues around cancer is it is not just one disease			0
it is truly multiple diseases , ' dr @entity28 told @entity32			0
' it makes it hard to find one drug that will treat every single person with lung cancer , or one treatment that will work in every single person with breast cancer			1
' the @entity12 's report analyzes how many deaths have been avoided by the declining cancer mortality rates - around 1.3 million deaths between 1991 to 2010			1
the research concludes that in men , prostate , lung , and colon cancer will account for about half of all newly diagnosed cancers in 2014			2
prostate cancer alone will account for around one in four male cancer cases			0

this research confirms that lung cancer is a lethal killer - more than one out of every four cancer deaths is due to that disease and the report states that in women , the three most common cancers this year will be breast , lung , and colon			0
even by itself breast cancer is projected to be 29 percent of the new cancer cases in women			0
the most impressive drop in cancer rates is among @entity129 men between 40 and 49			2
in this group there was a 55 percent decline in cancer deaths between 1991 and 2010			2
@entity134 , chief executive officer of the @entity12 , said : ' the halving of the risk of cancer death among middle aged black men in just two decades is extraordinary			2
' then @entity134 urged caution in analyzing this hopeful figure : ' but it is immediately tempered by the knowledge that death rates are still higher among black men than white men for nearly every major cancer and for all cancers combined			2

cancer mortality rates have declined continually for the last two decades
decline in smoking , as well as earlier diagnosis and better treatment is responsible for the fall
but cancer will still kill around 1,604 @entity5 per day in 2014
