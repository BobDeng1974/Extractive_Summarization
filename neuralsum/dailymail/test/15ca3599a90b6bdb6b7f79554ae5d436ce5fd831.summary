we know him as ' @entity2 ' - the toddler with a clenched fist and look of satisfaction who 's become the internet 's most positive meme			1
but now @entity10 is eight years old and is using his online fame to help out his sick dad			1
his mother , @entity13 from @entity14 , @entity15 , set up a @entity17 page to raise the $ 75,000 her husband , @entity18 , needs for the kidney transplant and years of subsequent medications			1
' please help us reach our goal so that @entity18 may get the pre-treatments and transplant he desperately needs , ' she wrote on the fundraising page			2
his mother snapped the photo - which actually shows him just moments before trying to put sand in his mouth - when he was 11 months ' his mother died from this disease , please help us write a different story for @entity18 and his son , @entity40			1
' by tuesday afternoon , the page had raised more than $ 38,000 of the goal			2
although @entity10 initially decided against using the notoriety of ' @entity2 ' to help raise funds , she eventually spoke to @entity46 about the campaign because of her fears for her husband			1
@entity18 , 39 , discovered his kidneys were failing before the birth of their son and he now spends about four hours a day , three days a week undergoing dialysis , mrs @entity13 told @entity54			2
he is unable to work and never has energy , she said			0
the longer he is on the dialysis , the higher the chance that he could develop complications			0
' six years on dialysis is getting to be a long time , ' she said			2
' it 's wearing on him			0
' sign of success : his face has since been used to create the internet 's most positive meme , pictured @entity67 : an image shows @entity26 , who is now eight years old , posing beside a t - shirt bearing his face the funds will supplement the money @entity72 puts towards the procedure			1
the family will also need $ 12,000 for just the first year of medications , although he 'll be on drugs for the rest of his life			0
it is also not yet clear where the kidney will come from and so the family is also using the @entity17 page to ask strangers to see if they could be a match			1
so far , no friends or family members have proved a match , she told @entity46 , and getting on a list for a deceased donor can take at least five years			0
' we certainly prefer a living donor because the prognosis seems to be much better , ' she said			0
' we 're certainly not opposed [ to waiting for a donor ] , but obviously , the sooner the better for us all			0
' to help raise awareness about her husband 's need for a kidney , she turned to her son for help			2
mrs @entity13 had snapped the photo of @entity26 on the beach when he was 11 months old			1
the image looks as if he is punching the air - but she said he was actually about to put sand in his mouth			0
close : @entity18 , pictured , discovered his kidneys were failing before @entity40 was born and receives dialysis appeal : the boy 's mother , @entity113 , said she initially did n't want to use the boy 's famous face to raise funds because she wanted the focus to be on @entity18 , but she said she just wants to see him healthy she put the photo on her @entity121 page in 2007 and two years later , she noticed that it was being used for memes before eventually becoming the beloved ' @entity2 ' meme around 2010			1
his face has featured on billboard , tv commercials and t - shirts , which mrs @entity13 called both ' weird ' and ' awesome '			0
' by now , it 's just out there , ' she said			0
' what am i going to do ? at least it 's positive			0
without that happening , how much could i get this recognition about my husband 's kidney transplant ? ' there are more than 100,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant in the @entity140 , and of the 29,531 kidney transplants carried out last year , 23,715 were from living donors , according to the @entity143 .			1

@entity10 was just 11 months old when his mother snapped him clenching his fist on the beach and posted the image online
years later , she learned it had become the *popular* ' @entity2 ' meme
@entity26 's father , @entity18 , has been on dialysis for six years and is in need of a kidney transplant so the family is now appealing for help
they have set up a @entity17 page to try to find him a kidney and to raise the $ 75,000 he will need for the procedure and medication
