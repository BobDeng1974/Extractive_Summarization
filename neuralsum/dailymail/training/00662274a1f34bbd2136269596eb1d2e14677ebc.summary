@entity0 won over critics as she transformed into @entity2 on thursday but her live tv performance was not without the odd high - wire hitch			1
the 26 - year - old actress , better known for playing character @entity6 in hit show girls , had a wobbly take - off at the start of the @entity11 show			1
@entity0 almost crashed into a wall in an opening scene where @entity2 demonstrates his magical flying powers to @entity15			2
the three - hour production of @entity2 live ! also starred @entity33 as a charismatic captain hook - complete with tap - dancing			1
however the veteran actor also came under fire for apparent lip - syncing			1
one critic tweeted : ' is @entity33 playing @entity40 , or is @entity40 playing a caricature of @entity33 ? ' but the performance appeared to be a hit with some viewers as today anchor @entity45 quipped on friday : ' it was not @entity46			1
' on @entity49 , one viewer , @ joey_aulisio , wrote : ' @entity0 killed it			0
that wooden gator killed it			0
that dog ! great job everyone			0
' another , @ ryansatin , wrote : ' if you 're not watching @entity33 as @entity40 , you are missing out on a truly special moment in tv history			1
' @entity0 got a boost of support before tackling the three - hour live performance from her co-star @entity66 , @entity67 and her dad , news anchor @entity69 we 're hooked : veteran star @entity33 showed off tap - dancing skills with his band of pirates as @entity2 's arch nemesis @entity40 @entity2 's nemesis @entity40 , played by @entity33 was a hit with viewers , with @entity77 tweeting : ' @entity33 = @entity78 , no matter what ' surprise cameo : the voice of the narrator throughout , @entity81 came out at the very end to play @entity15 after she was all grown up - and still hoping for @entity2 's return the blue - and - purple crocodile which torments captain hook and his pirates was a big hit with viewers girls co-star @entity66 tweeted : ' @entity0 is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst			1
' celebrity fans also offered their support			0
@entity67 tweeted : ' i believe in you @entity0 ! ' @entity99 joked : ' @entity69 is crushing this			1
' the @entity102 host took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter 's performance from the wings			1
mr @entity69 told @entity107 : ' we will be watching the broadcast - immediate family only - sequestered in an undisclosed location ... close enough to the production as to burst through the stage door the moment the credits roll			2
' @entity114 , a 22 - year - old woman of @entity116 descent , was plucked from obscurity to play the starring role of native american princess character @entity54 @entity2 , played by @entity0 , meets @entity15 , played by @entity121 star @entity120 ( left ) however there were grumbles from viewers , as one @entity49 user , @ @entity126 , wrote : ' although @entity0 is singing beautiful , but her @entity128 accent is horrible ! # @entity129 '			1
another fired back : ' chill with the hate people			0
just be thankful its not as awful as @entity134 in @entity135 '			0
@entity33 delighted viewers with his drawling , sashaying captain hook			1
his tap dancing , alongside an accomplished band of pirates , drew high praise			0
one viewer , rather unbelievably , compared him to @entity144			0
but as @entity77 tweeted : ' @entity33 = @entity78 , no matter what			2
' the @entity15 children take flight under @entity2 's instructions with the @entity11 telecast making much use of the high - wire during the three - hour production @entity2 leads the @entity15 children off to @entity153 in the live adaptation of the 1954 @entity156 - animated film @entity2 with @entity15 and her brothers fly off to @entity153 in the live telecast of the children 's classic @entity0 looked a world away from her @entity163 character @entity6 with her hair in a pixie crop to play @entity2 @entity2 @entity166 ! came a year after @entity11 's three - hour live telecast of @entity168 starring @entity134 revived the idea of a broadcast network mounting a full - scale musical for live tv			1
that attracted nearly 19 million viewers but came in for criticism with @entity134 , who played @entity176 , panned for her ' amateur ' acting and @entity178 , as captain @entity179 , written off for ' clenched ' singing			1
this time , there was much more dancing , the addition of complicated flying routines , some mermaids , sword fights , digital overlays like @entity188 and shadows , and a live dog			0
director and choreographer @entity191 had his work cut out for him			0
like @entity135 , @entity2 @entity166 ! wisely leaned on @entity121 performers , including five - time @entity196 - nominee @entity195 , who was sadly underused , as mrs @entity15			1
the show also starred @entity198 ( who was in @entity197 ) as @entity54 and a very good @entity120 ( @entity199 ) as @entity15			0
the beefy - armed @entity201 , a @entity196 winner and veteran of last year 's @entity200 , played mr @entity54			2
( in a twist , @entity201 won his @entity196 playing captain hook in the @entity2 play @entity205			1
) @entity201 , who also stars in @entity206 , actually played two characters - the children ’s strict dad mr @entity54 as well as @entity40 ’s right - hand pirate , @entity210 , a character he was far more successful at playing			2
but one of the stand - out performances came from the show ’s second biggest star , @entity81 , despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes			2
despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout , @entity81 came out at the very end to play @entity15 after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for @entity2 ’s return			2
captain @entity40 's pirates were also big hits with viewers during the spirited three - hour special performance the tea party : the @entity227 perform a routine with @entity0 as @entity2 ( center ) the merry band of @entity2 's @entity227 during a scene from thursday 's performance			1
@entity2 @entity166 ! wisely leaned on @entity121 performers @entity15 's emotional moment at the end as @entity2 finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears			1
it was also a more culturally sensitive @entity2 , with @entity114 , a 22 - year - old woman of @entity116 descent , portraying the @entity244 princess character @entity54 , and the offensive song @entity245 transformed into @entity246			1
however the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple - and - blue crocodile , who tormenting captain hook and his pirates throughout			2
' and the blue crocodile just broke @entity49 , ’ viewer @entity252 tweeted			0
@entity15 sings a romantic song expressing her unrequited love for @entity2 in a performance which stayed true to @entity258 's classic novel @entity15 ( pictured right ) was played by @entity120 who has also appeared in @entity121 musical bring it on showdown : captain hook and @entity2 come face - to - face in the musical performance on thursday @entity33 's captain hook character delighted viewers with his drawling dialogue and dancing @entity0 ' girls co-star @entity66 tweeted : ' @entity0 is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst			1

the 26 - year - old girls star won over critics in her three - hour live @entity11 adaptation on thursday - but the show had its fair share of problems
captain hook star @entity33 *accused* of lip - syncing and *bizarre* performance
one critic tweeted : ' is @entity33 playing @entity40 , or is @entity40 playing a caricature of @entity33 ? '
@entity2 @entity166 ! reached *9.1* million viewers - less than half what @entity168 did for @entity11 last year
@entity66 tweeted : ' @entity0 is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst '
@entity102 host @entity69 took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter 's performance from the wings
