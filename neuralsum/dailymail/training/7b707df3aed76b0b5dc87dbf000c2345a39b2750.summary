by @entity1 reporter published : 11:29 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 8 august 2013 it was one of the year ’s most ridiculous films but it seems that some fans have taken the message behind @entity7 quite seriously			0
in celebration of @entity12 ’s @entity11 , one gun fan has decided to test which ammunition would be most effective in fighting off attacking sharks			1
@entity15 from @entity16 tested three different bullets to find out which would best defend your family			1
he planned to find out which ammunition would work best against a shark @entity24 fan mr @entity15 shows off his enthusiasm for artillery mr @entity15 uses a flamethrower on a car during the opening to his experiment and as an added bonus , he created some beautiful footage of slow notion bullets travelling through the water			1
he said : ‘ your guns and chainsaws might save you on land , but how far will different types of ammunition travel underwater in case a two headed shark is trying to sink your boat			1
’ @entity7 , starring @entity44 , is a disaster film about a waterspout that lists sharks out of the ocean and leaves them in @entity49 first , mr @entity15 tries a @entity50 9mm hollow point bullet which travelled just over a metre the collapsing water created beautiful shapes in the water in an alternative camera angle , the second bullet the @entity56 9mm @entity57 passes through the water the water collapsed in on itself , resembling small nuclear explosions he warns watchers not to try the experiments at home as they are extremely dangerous			1
first , mr @entity15 tries a @entity50 9mm hollow point bullet and a @entity56 9mm @entity57			2
the former travelled 110cm into the water while the latter travelled 15cm further			0
the @entity71 made a stunning path through the water as it travelled more than two metres the @entity71 bullet was clearly the best one to use against a shark in the event of a @entity7 the last bullet he tried was a @entity80 9mm @entity71 which managed a massive 210cm , making it the clear winner			0
mr @entity15 also discussed supercavitation technology			2
taken from torpedoes , it could allow a gun owner to fire under water accurately up to 60metres			0
it also allows the user to fire into the water without it ricocheting off the surface			0
at least now we know which ammunition will kill a shark in the event of a real @entity7			0

conducted tests firing guns underwater and *measuring* their *distances*
@entity15 used three different bullets to discover that a @entity108 travels *farthest*
