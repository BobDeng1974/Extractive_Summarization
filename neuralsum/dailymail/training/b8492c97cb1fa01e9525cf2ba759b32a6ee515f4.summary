it ’s not just men who suffer a ‘ mid-life crisis ’ - chimpanzees and orangutans do too , a new study claims			1
researchers set out to test the theory that the pattern of human well - being over a lifespan might have evolved in the common ancestors of humans and great apes			1
an international team of scientists discovered that , as in humans , chimpanzee and orangutan well - being , or happiness , follows a u-shape and is high in youth , falls in middle age , and rises again into old age			2

a new study claims that apes suffer from mid-life crises much like men do the researchers - including economist professor @entity36 from the @entity37 and psychologist dr @entity38 from the @entity39 - studied 508 great apes housed in zoos and sanctuaries in the @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the apes ’ well - being was assessed by keepers , volunteers , researchers and caretakers who knew the apes well			1
their happiness was scored with a series of measures adapted from human subjective well - being measures			2
professor @entity36 said : ' we hoped to understand a famous scientific puzzle : why does human happiness follow an approximate u-shape through life ? the happiest years , for apes too : happiness in apes , as in humans , follows a u-shape - high in youth , falling in middle age , and rising again in old age ' we ended up showing that it can not be because of mortgages , marital break - up , mobile phones , or any of the other paraphernalia of modern life			1
apes also have a pronounced mid-life low , and they have none of those			2
' the study is the first of its kind and the authors knew their work was likely to be unconventional			0
dr @entity38 said : ' based on all of the other behavioural and developmental similarities between humans , chimpanzees , and orangutans , we predicted that there would be similarities when looking at happiness over the lifespan , too			0
' however , one never knows how these things will turn out , so it ’s wonderful when they are consistent with findings from so many other areas			0
” the team included primatologists and psychologists from @entity44 and the @entity43 they pointed out that their findings do not rule out the possibility that economic events or social and cultural forces contribute part of the reason for the well - being @entity112 shape in humans			1
however , they also highlighted the need to consider evolutionary or biological explanations			0
for example , individuals being satisfied at stages of their life where they have fewer resources to improve their lot may be less likely to encounter situations that could be harmful to them or their families			0
the findings were published in the @entity126 .			0
