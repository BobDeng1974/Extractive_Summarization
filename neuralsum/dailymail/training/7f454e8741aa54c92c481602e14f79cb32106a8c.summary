by @entity0 published : 19:39 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:36 est , 19 february 2014 foreign migrants will be banned from receiving benefits unless they earn a minimum of £ 149 a week , under new rules unveiled today			1
from march 1st people from @entity9 countries who claim to have been in work or self - employed in order to gain access to a wider range of benefits will face a more robust test			1
under current @entity19 law the definition of a ‘ worker ’ is very broad meaning that those who work just a few hours a week in a pub once a week can access @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
now , the definitions of ' worker ' are very broad , to the point that only a few hours work a week entitle a person to things like housing benefit and child support			1
but under new rules , this definition will become a lot stricter to show they are undertaking genuine and effective work in the @entity38 a @entity9 migrant will have to show that for the last three months they have been earning at the level at which employees start paying @entity42			1
the new minimum income threshold is the equivalent of a working 24 hours a week at the minimum wage			2
those who qualify as a ‘ worker ’ will be able to claim benefits , including @entity49 if they fall out of work			1
they will also be able to claim @entity51 and @entity52 as well			0
those who fail to meet the minimum income requirement will be classed as a jobseeker or not economically active and will have to wait three months after they start searching for work before they can claim @entity49			0
from april 1st they will also have to wait three months before claiming housing benefit as well			0
work and pensions secretary @entity69 said : ‘ as part of the government ’s long - term economic plan we have taken action to make sure our economy delivers for people who want to work hard , play by the rules and contribute to this country			1
‘ these reforms will ensure we have a fair system - one which provides support for genuine workers and jobseekers , but does not allow people to come to our country and take advantage of our benefits system			1
‘ the @entity38 public are rightly concerned that migrants should contribute to this country , and not be drawn here by the attractiveness of our benefits system			2
’ migrants to the @entity38 will be under particular scrutiny under the new laws , in order to prevent ' benefit tourism ' by new @entity19 countries the level of the minimum income requirement will be permanently pegged to the level of the @entity91 , which is £ 149 a week -- £ 7755 a year -- in 2013/14 , and £ 153 a week , or £ 7956 a year , in 2014/15			2
the changes come after @entity93 set out a number of areas where he wanted the benefit system to be tightened in a speech last year			0
the prime minister demanded action amid concerns from mps that the end of restrictions on new arrivals from @entity105 and @entity106 - lifted on january 1st - would lead to a huge influx of migrants			0
since january 1st all migrants from the @entity110 have been subjected to a tougher ‘ habitual residence test ’ and will have to wait for three months before they can get income - based @entity49			0
if they pass the test jobseekers will then only be able to get @entity49 for 6 months			0
after 6 months , only those who have a job offer or compelling evidence that they have a genuine chance of finding work will be able to continue claiming			0
a @entity120 source added : ‘ this is all part of the government ’s long term plan to cap welfare and reduce immigration so our economy delivers for people who actively contribute and want to work hard and play by the rules			2

currently the definition regarding who is a ' worker ' is very open
at the moment people can work a few hours a week and claim benefits
new rules would make claiming benefits a lot stricter
people will have to earn a certain amount in order to have the right to claim
secretary @entity69 says : ' reforms will ensure a fair system '
reforms will ' not allow people to come to @entity38 and take advantage '
