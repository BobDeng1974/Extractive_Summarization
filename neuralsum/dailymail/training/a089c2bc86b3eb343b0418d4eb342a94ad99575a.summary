by @entity0 not installing anti-virus and security software on new devices such as laptops and mobiles means that almost half of us are at risk from cyber attacks			1
that is the view of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , which is launching a new campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of not protecting yourself online			1
the campaign is calling for internet users to be ' cyber streetwise ' and take steps to better protect themselves			0
the initiative is being led by the @entity11 's @entity21 ( @entity22 ) in partnership with a @entity25 campaign			1
the new campaign wants to improve cyber common sense and cut down on the amount of security breaches that occur from opening malicious emails or using infected usb sticks - both of which are cited as common issues among web users			2
@entity48 , the director of the @entity22 , said : ' the internet is a great place to explore the world and do business , and the majority of people wo n't experience any problems			0
but for the minority who leave themselves unprotected , not downloading and updating their security software can be very costly			0
' it 's tricky to put exact figures on the cost of cyber crime to the @entity35 and the number of people who do n't protect themselves , but what we do know is that far too many people continue to put themselves and others at risk online			1
' however , the cost to individuals not only hits their pockets but also their personal and family life , which is why it 's important that everyone takes steps to protect their computer , tablet and mobile			2
' the @entity11 is offering four key tips to users in order to improve web security ; encouraging users to install security software , not open emails from unknown sources , take caution with usb sticks and cds , and buy software from legitimate sources only			1
the year 2014 has seen a series of high - profile cyber security issues , including the @entity96 bug that affected the encryption and protection of personal data online , as well as the hacking of @entity102 's servers that saw passwords and user names compromised			0
these incidents have increased the focus on web security , particularly when paired with @entity110 whistleblower @entity109 's continued calls for users to do more to protect data from government snooping , as well as hackers			2
according to statistics , almost 40 per cent of adults rarely install or update the security software on new devices , leaving them at risk			0
it is these sort of statistics that have prompted this initiative , say the government			0
according to statistics , almost 40 per cent of adults rarely install or update the security software on new devices , leaving them at risk organised crime minister @entity126 said : ' the internet has radically changed the way we work and socialise , but cyber crime now poses a serious threat to the @entity35 , and the government has taken action to transform the way we respond			1
' through the @entity135 , we have dedicated £ 860million over five years to make the @entity35 one of the most secure places in the world to go online			1
the @entity11 works with police forces to pursue those involved in criminal activity			2
' this campaign , which draws on the @entity11 's experiences in fighting cyber crime , sheds light on some of the ways in which malware can operate			2
but it also shows there are a few simple steps that we can all take to reduce the chances of falling victim to cyber crime and ensure we can keep enjoying the benefits of the internet			0
' however , professor @entity156 of @entity157 is highly critical of the security industry that has grown up around so - called cybercrime			1
prof @entity156 believes that attempts to regulate the internet are doomed to fail and are a waste of time and money			0
in 2011 a report was issued claiming that the @entity35 was losing £ 27billion a year to cybercrime			1
prof @entity156 and his colleagues decided to carry out an investigation into the real cost of cybercrime to the state , businesses and citizens			0
their report completely demolished the official figures and found out that the cost of fighting cybercrime was greater than the cost of the crimes themselves			0
prof @entity156 said that true cost of cybercrime to each citizen is about £ 1 a year while the cost of fighting crime is more than £ 10 each a year			2
' almost all the cost of cybercrime is the cost of anticipation , ' he added			0
@entity186 web - server guru @entity184 , the pioneer of @entity188 – the ' secure sockets layer ' that keeps web transactions secure , decries the use of anti-virus software , which he says ' does n't really work , it has a high false negative rate			1
