@entity20 , 21 , ( left ) killed pc @entity7 , 28 , ( right ) who was out celebrating his birthday , with a single punch and then played @entity23			1
@entity20 is today beginning a four - and - a - half - year jail term for manslaughter his killer @entity20 , 21 , who played an @entity23 computer game after the fatal attack in @entity29 , told a friend : ' i have just hit the lad , i think i have killed him			1
' when police caught up with him he falsely blamed @entity36 for the tragedy and said : ' so that guy has died has he , what do you expect when they front you up ? i ’m not gon na stand there am i ? ' today as @entity20 began four - and - a - half - years in jail after being convicted of manslaughter , pc @entity7 ' parents @entity41 and @entity42 , both 55 , said even 1,000 years in jail would not be enough			1
in a statement they said : ' in one single punch , a solitary criminal act and a moment of madness , @entity20 not only took @entity7 ’s life but he took ours too			1
' life as we knew it also died that terrible night because our lives have never been the same since			2
' in fact we consider our lives in two separate entities ; life before @entity7 died and life after			1
there are few similarities between the two			2
life before @entity7 died was perfect			1
' the life we have now is the polar opposite of this perfection			0
it is so extreme it hardly bears resemblance to our ‘ before @entity7 died ’ life			1
it feels like it has all gone			0
' everything we did revolved around our family			0
the drive we had in life was all to do with providing for our children and now that drive has gone because our family has lost its key component , our only son			0
a police tent at the scene in @entity29 , where off - duty police officer @entity7 , 28 , was killed after being punched by @entity20 , 21 ' we accept no sentence passed can ever bring @entity7 back but we needed to see some justice done			1
' we understand the sentence ca n’t be 1,000 years in prison and even if it was it would not provide even an ounce of comfort because our grief is too intense for any relief			0
' we want @entity20 to realise the very great human cost and catastrophic lifelong consequences for those left to grieve , of a split second decision to throw one single punch which took the life of our beautiful son			1
' the tragedy occurred on january 20 after pc @entity7 who worked for @entity96 based at @entity97 and described as a ' consummate professional police officer ' had gone out to celebrate his birthday with friends			1
the group were about to go home at the end of the evening after being dropped off by taxi when one of the officer ’s friends @entity108 bumped into @entity20 by chance			1
@entity108 and @entity20 were said to have a ' long history of ill feeling ' and began eyeballing each other before violence broke out			2
the coffin of pc @entity7 , who was described as a ' consummate professional police officer ' , is escorted to @entity116 in @entity29 @entity20 lashed out and ' used his fist in anger ' upon @entity119 who was looking on as ' his way of having the last word , ' said prosecutors at @entity123			1
in their statement @entity36 ’ father , a director of an electrical company added : ' we were present as our son ’s last moments were played out in public in court on @entity132 , we have listened as our son ’s killer told lies after lies			0
' i have had to watch my wife and daughter ’s pain as we struggle as a family to comprehend how someone can kill such an amazing man and then go and play on a playstation game - entirely indifferent to the fact that our beautiful @entity7 lay dying in the street where he left him			2
' it is the height of disrespect			0
our loss is so great that we can never forgive him			0
' sir @entity153 , chief constable of @entity96 ( far left ) , and colleagues at the funeral of pc @entity7 at @entity116 in @entity29 @entity20 was arrested at a friend ’s home at 4.25am , just over three hours after @entity36 ’ collapse			1
he said he had been playing the @entity23 game to ' take his mind off the fight '			0
during the trial he denied unlawful killing claiming he feared @entity119 was about to attack him when he threw the fateful punch			2
he told the jury : ' he was coming at me			0
it could have been me on the floor			0
i thought he was going to hit me , it could have been me			0
i acted in self - defence			0
he come at me and i threw a punch			0
' but passing sentence judge @entity173 told him : ' @entity7 was a much loved son and his parents were at the stage of their life where they expect they would watch him develop as an adult and live a successful and fruitful life			2
' the whole family has been devastated by his death and you caused it			0
you meant to strike him and the consequences were tragic			0
you wanted to take advantage of the surprise attack and you did			2
' you have a capacity for confrontation and aggressive behaviour which was demonstrated in this case			1
you did not intend the harm but the harm was of the highest level			0
there was no remorse evident during the trial			2
' after the case @entity198 , @entity199 for @entity200 said : ' @entity20 ’s violent actions caused the needless death of @entity7 , whose chosen career was to dutifully serve the public as a police officer			1
' this case demonstrates just how much damage one punch can cause , and although no outcome can compensate @entity7 ’s family and friends for their devastating loss			2
' senior investigating officer @entity214 of @entity96 said : ' the consequences of what @entity20 did have been devastating for both @entity7 ’s family , his partner , friends and for his colleagues in the police force			1
' his single punch has led to a tragic waste of a young life and he will now spend the rest of his life living with the consequences			0
' this case once again demonstrates the dreadful outcomes possible when people try to settle disputes with their fists			0
