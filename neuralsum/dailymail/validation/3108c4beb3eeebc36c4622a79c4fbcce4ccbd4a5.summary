drilling has begun beneath a @entity2 city by a team of @entity5 pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled @entity7 of the @entity8			1
the @entity10 treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of @entity13			1
the @entity7 - valued at around £ 250million in today 's money - was looted from the palace of @entity16 in @entity17 by invading @entity19 troops in 1941			1
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from @entity23 never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered			1
some say the panels were destroyed by @entity17 artillery fire on the @entity30 city of @entity31 , others that they were dumped in an @entity33 by the @entity34 in the closing days of the war			2
but @entity36 , 68 , and his bowling club pals , say they have proof it was entombed by the @entity39 beneath the streets of @entity13			1
it is here , said @entity36 , that he has received information that the crates arrived from @entity31 early in 1945 to be hidden			1
he said : ' @entity55 , the @entity19 gauleiter of @entity30 who died in a @entity59 prison in 1986 , came from @entity13			1
' as the @entity60 closed in on @entity31 , he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown			1
we have studied records and spoken to people from the time			0
' he did not want to leave the world 's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future ; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future			2
' in search of lost treasure : a group of bowling club friends say they have proof the @entity7 was entombed by the @entity39 beneath @entity13 following the scent : the group claim to have received information that the crates arrived from @entity31 early in 1945 to be hidden in the @entity2 city of @entity13 opulent : a complete restoration of the @entity7 in the @entity48 of @entity90 near @entity91 , the original of which was plundered by the @entity39 in @entity23 , but has since disappeared the £ 250million room , consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete			1
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from @entity23 never to be found the local authority have given @entity36 and his four friends permission to dig in the @entity19 structures and a local building firm has loaned them some heavy drilling equipment			2
' i ca n't reveal who our sources are , but we are not doing this for fun , ' he added			0
' we will find the @entity7 here			0
' others have been just as certain in the past			0
the @entity114 author @entity113 founded the @entity115 after @entity23 to track it down once and for all			0
everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work			0
plundered : the remains of the @entity7 after it was seized by the @entity39 , who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to @entity19 , where they vanished never to be seen again stripped bare : some say the panels were destroyed by @entity17 artillery fire on the @entity30 city of @entity31 , while others claim they were dumped in an @entity33 by the @entity34 in the closing days of the war destroyed : @entity16 received the room as a gift from the @entity134 in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , @entity91			1
here it is seen before restoriation the @entity7 consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete and is valued at some £ 250million in today 's money			1
@entity16 received the room as a gift from the @entity134 in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , @entity91			1
the 16 - feet of jigsaw - puzzle style panels were constructed of more than 100,000 perfectly fitted pieces of amber			2
in 1755 , it was moved to the @entity48 at @entity145 , 17 miles south of the @entity148 @entity147 capital			0
in 1941 , the approaching @entity19 army surrounded the city , then known by its @entity17 name of @entity91			1
@entity145 was one of the outlying areas occupied by the @entity2			0
they packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to @entity19 , where they vanished			1
dozens of theories have been put forward for their whereabouts and in some cases , millions spent trying to unearth the treasure , but as yet nothing has been found			2
in 2006 an @entity164 team spent £ 7million diving into the glacial waters of @entity167 in @entity168			2
@entity169 , the founder of @entity170 , said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in april 1945 , one month before the capitulation of @entity19			1
paperwork from the @entity176 - the @entity176 of the @entity34 in wartime - shows the @entity7 was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the @entity2 from @entity17			1
the team also say the @entity179 lettering on the remains of a wooden crate they found , bearing the words ' fragile ' and numbered could mean it once contained a piece of the @entity7 jigsaw			2
@entity167 was used by @entity187 's forces in the last two years of the war for secret underwater experiments using dynamite and rockets			2
it later turned it into a dumping ground for anything the @entity39 wanted to hide from the advancing allies			2
but the lake has yielded little since @entity23 , except for forged £ 5 notes which were printed by the @entity39 and intended to cause chaos for the @entity201 economy			1
in 2011 , a book published in @entity19 claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east @entity19			1
' @entity206 ' by @entity207 unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels , metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork			1
casualties of war : inhabitants of @entity91 ( now @entity91 ) flee after a @entity2 bomb attack in the winter of 1941 when the @entity39 seized the @entity7 during their assault on the city the @entity48 in @entity91 ( as seen in 2010 ) where the @entity7 is housed @entity207 interviewed foresters , policemen , miners and old nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near @entity230			1
@entity231 , a civil engineer and hobby historian on @entity23 , has triggered another @entity7 frenzy after researching wartime records of the town of @entity236 near @entity237			0
@entity238 was the place where @entity187 built the two biggest guns in history - @entity241 and @entity242 - both mighty railway mounted monsters capable of hurling shells weighing tons			0
as he probed into the history of the cannons he discovered plans for secret underground workings			0
then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of @entity31 - now @entity254 and part of @entity17 but in 1945 the main city of @entity19 's province of @entity30 - which was the last known storage place of the @entity7 before it fell to the @entity60			1
art haul : the room was plundered by @entity187 's nazis during the @entity23 @entity30 count @entity262 , the @entity2 ' ' art protection officer ' and holder of a degree in art history , supervised the room 's transport to @entity270 from the @entity271			2
in january 1945 , after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city , the room was lost			2
@entity231 found documents about an air raid on the marshalling yards of @entity279 - then @entity2 , now the @entity59 city of @entity279 - on 4 february 1945			2
the army report stated that 40 wagons from @entity283 , which had fallen days earlier to the @entity60 , were undamaged in the attack and were moving down to @entity236 ' under conditions of the greatest secrecy			0
' @entity287 , now 80 , is an @entity236 resident who told @entity288 that , as a child , he remembered in the @entity290 outside the town a massive shelter built for munitions works employees that he went into as a boy			0
it vanished off of maps after the war but in march 2011 he and @entity231 managed to find a ventilation shaft that leads down into a subterranean structure they believe is the old shelter			0
they , and others , have still not managed to access it			0
many @entity7 purists believe the treasure lies in the @entity308 in what was the @entity310			0
it is the most dangerous of the hunting grounds and draws scores of illegal searchers every weekend			0
the centre of the @entity308 is at @entity315 and was the site of the @entity318 headquarters			0
it is a tunnel system many miles in length with thousands of caves , bunkers and storerooms			0
it was intended to be the @entity325 leadership			0
@entity164 liberated it and @entity164 authorities have since classified all 1945 documents relating to @entity315 for a minimum of 100 years			0
' like no other place in @entity19 this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters , ' wrote @entity335 , @entity19 's top news magazine			1
both above and below ground , the area is littered with shells and bombs big enough to destroy a city block			0
at weekends authorities play cat - and - mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed - off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories			1
fortune hunter @entity351 , author of ' @entity352 , ' likes to guide treasure seekers through the @entity308			0
@entity351 believes that @entity187 had @entity354 - like flying saucers developed in bunkers at the site - as well as using one of the chambers as a repository for the @entity7 .			0
