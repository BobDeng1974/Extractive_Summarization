by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 16 august 2013 @entity2 : 14:36 est , 16 august 2013 the @entity4 long - range missiles that jangled nerves across the world when paraded through @entity7 last month were ' almost certainly ' fake , government experts and independent researchers have claimed			1
the weapons , which were showcased in a lavish show of military muscle to mark the 60th anniversary of the korean war armistice , were heavily criticised by researchers who insisted they would be unable to fly let alone unleash a deadly attack on the @entity16			1
the experts came to the conclusion , following an investigation by @entity20 , after studying a series of high - definition photographs taken during the parade , held on july 27			1
all a big hoax : the retro rockets should be mounted to the left of this @entity28 intercontinental ballistic missile bogus bombs : the weapons were showcased in a lavish show of military muscle last month ' undulating skin ' : one expert pointed to ' undulating skin ' on the warheads that would create drag , pulling them off course and out of the sky in a matter of minutes whimsical warmongering : the experts came to the conclusion after studying a series of high - definition photographs taken during the parade held on july 27 the revelation casts further doubt on the hermit nation 's bellicose showboating after its failed @entity52 rocket launch in april 2012			1
' my opinion is that it 's a big hoax , ' said @entity55 , an aerospace engineer in @entity56 and former @entity58 military analyst			0
he said he saw no evidence of ' retro rockets ' on the back of the @entity62 , hardware that is necessary to propel them into sub-orbital space and strike faraway targets			1
@entity67 , an @entity20 space and missile expert who witnessed first hand the 2012 failed launch , agreed , pointing to ' undulating skin ' in the warheads that proves they are bogus			1
grandiose statement : unidentified @entity4 drones are displayed during a military parade past @entity79 square marking the 60th anniversary of the korean war armistice in @entity7 fake numbers : an expert added that @entity4 also seems to be trying to inflate the number of weapons it claims to possess , claiming it reproduces old pictures of warheads to pass them off as new ' upper - stage missile skin has got to be really smooth , or else it sets off high - speed turbulent air flow that can both heat the region and also create localized drag effects that can pull the missile far off attitude ( direction ) , or even pull it sideways and thus lead to loss of control and disintegration , ' he said			1
@entity55 added that @entity4 also seems to be trying to inflate the number of @entity102 - 13s it claims to possess , saying it reproduces old pictures of warheads to pass them off as new ' i can tell that on the mock - ups , they simply changed the markings and serial numbers from last year 's parade to make it look like they have more missiles , ' he said			2
it is not the first time @entity4 's missile capabilities have been called into question			0
in 2012 , experts claimed the @entity4 missiles that were paraded as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the country 's founding father , @entity79 , were also probably fakes			2
' there is no doubt that these missiles were mock - ups			0
it remains unknown if they were designed this way to confuse foreign analysts , or if the designers simply did some sloppy work , ' revealed a researcher in a paper posted on @entity135			0
those missiles , called @entity137 , were loaded on to the largest mobile launch vehicles @entity4 has ever unveiled			0
not so impressive : the revelation casts further doubt on leader @entity141 's chest - beating after its failed @entity52 rocket launch in april 2012 ( above ) that caused an international stir with the weapons appearing to be new , and designed for long - range attacks			1
along with developing nuclear weapons , @entity4 has long been suspected of trying to field an icbm capable of reaching the @entity16			0
@entity149 contends that @entity4 's failed april 13 rocket launch was an attempt to test missile technology rather than the scientific mission @entity7 claims			2
@entity4 has a particularly bad track record with @entity156 - style rockets			2
its four launches since 1998 - three of which it claimed carried satellites - all ended in failure			0
@entity4 also frequently overstates its military capabilities			0
last year , one of its senior military leaders , vice marshal @entity164 , claimed his country was armed with powerful modern weapons capable of defeating the @entity16 ' at a single blow ' .			0

they were showcased in lavish show of muscle last month in @entity7
but experts cry fake after studying series of high - definition photographs
one claims ' undulating skin ' on warheads would render them unable to fly
another claims no evidence of ' retro rockets ' , *crucial* for long - distance *flight*
