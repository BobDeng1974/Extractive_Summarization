@entity0 insists that he will be able to keep his second choice keeper happy at @entity2 even though @entity3 are ready to move for @entity4 this week in anticipation of the @entity2 keeper being dropped for the opening match of the club ’s season at @entity9			1
@entity0 will only reveal his starting line - up on sunday in training but @entity0 pressed the club to bring @entity13 back from his three - year loan spell at @entity15 and the @entity16 is expected to start at @entity17 tomorrow			1
@entity3 want to bring @entity4 and @entity2 goalkeeping coach , @entity18 , to the club and if a permanent transfer can not be agreed they would be prepared to take the player on loan , as it would help them in meeting @entity23 ’s @entity24 restrictions			1
dropped : @entity4 is expected to be dropped for @entity2 's match against @entity9 @entity3 were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure			1
@entity3 see @entity4 as the ideal man to help them as they bid to win the @entity31 , deeming him better than current @entity32 , @entity34 @entity33			2
but @entity0 is insistent that he can keep both @entity13 and @entity4 happy and plans to play his second - choice keeper in occasional @entity37 and @entity31 games to keep him motivated			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we are @entity2			2
we can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club			0
. we can have @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , so we can have @entity13 and @entity4			2
i can have @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , yet i can not have two top goalkeepers ? i can			0
@entity2 can as a club , and i can as a manager			0
preference : @entity0 said having a strong goalkeeper is the most essential part of the team decisions : @entity57 have arguably the two best keepers in the league in @entity4 and @entity13 ‘ there are teams without a good goalkeeper and that ’s a big problem and that ’s a problem i do n’t want to have			1
in the team , if you ask me : “ tell me the position , the first position where you want to be strong			0
” i tell you : “ goalkeeper			0
” @entity18 would be likely to move with @entity4 , having worked with him since he played with @entity70 in 2002 - 04 but @entity0 ’s assistant manager , @entity71 , is also a goalkeeping coach and could fill the gap			0
@entity4 , like @entity43 , is likely to have a long - term role at the club when his contract runs out in 2016 but that would still be available to him if he spent time out on - loan for the next two years			0
return : @entity13 has spent the last three years on loan at @entity15			2

@entity0 insists he can keep @entity4 and @entity13 happy
@entity13 returned to @entity2 after three years at @entity15
@entity3 are *interested* in signing @entity4 , preferably on loan
