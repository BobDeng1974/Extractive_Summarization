’ cut : former newsreader @entity36 left the @entity37 claiming she had been sidelined because of her age the comments in an interview with the @entity41 are likely to rekindle the debate over broadcasting ageism			1
last month a new study revealed fewer than one in five presenters at major broadcasters over the age of 50 were women			2
overall women over 50 make up just 5 % of on - screen presenters of all ages and both sexes			2
the row began when former @entity55 presenter @entity54 won an age discrimination employment tribunal case against the @entity37 in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show when it moved to a primetime slot			2
she was 52 at the time and returned to work at the @entity37 , but later said the apologies and offers of work were ‘ clearly just a @entity64 damage limitation exercise			0
