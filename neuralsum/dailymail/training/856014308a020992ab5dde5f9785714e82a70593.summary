@entity4 ’s fixer in the paddock , his man friday and most loyal lieutenant , is a sardinian called @entity7			1
for years , he has whispered that ‘ @entity4 will live for ever … 120 or 130 eassssily … we ’ll all be gone before he is			1
’ and there appeared to be some strange truth in @entity7 ’s prediction when @entity4 resumed control of @entity13 after striking the deal of a lifetime of extraordinary deals : paying £ 60million to a @entity18 court to stop a bribery trial that could have put him in prison for 10 years			1
he flew straight back to @entity31 to ‘ do what i do best , which is run @entity13 ’			1
@entity4 , who is 83 , said he would resume his place on the board that runs @entity36 , @entity37 , having relinquished his position earlier this year to fight the charges in @entity40			1
there is no legal impediment to his doing so			0
@entity36 boss @entity4 pays to end bribery trial opportunistic : @entity4 signs an autograph for a fan after attending his trial in @entity40 all over : @entity4 stands in an elevator as he prepares to leave the court following his case being dropped so @entity4 seems to have won once again despite opposition factions within the business and the teams			1
he remains a shareholder and works as @entity36 chief executive of @entity55 , the private equity firm who have made more than five times their outlay since buying into the sport in 2005 - 6			2
so what lies ahead for @entity13 ? there are those who think that @entity4 is too old , or too dictatorial or too reluctant to market the sport in a modern world of social media			1
the detractors have pointed to falling tv audiences this season			0
@entity4 enraged many by saying that the internet was a passing fad			1
it is this kind of old - fashioned view that the modernisers will hope he addresses now he is firmly back in his office			2
thinking : @entity4 stands in the background as his lawyers discuss matters before the case was dropped despite the grumbling , it remains true that @entity4 has created a phenomenon in four decades running the sport			1
much of the wealth has been accrued through tv rights deals			0
he has also raised massive revenues from nations or individuals who want to stage a race			0
he has , as one very senior figure in the ownership of the sport told me , won round several of his detractors because he makes ‘ palaces out of sand ’ — races in the desert , or indeed in @entity99 , where the calendar takes grand prix racing in 2016			0
at every race we hear debates in the paddock about how to improve ‘ the show ’			0
i hope @entity4 proceeds with caution in this area			2
the sport should be wary of gimmicks , such as double points for the last race , that devalue the world championship			0
it should be bolder , and replace two of the practice sessions with races — not championship races with points counting towards the drivers ’ title , but fun , short sprints of , say , 20 laps , perhaps with reverse grids — something that should never be contemplated for the main race on sundays			0
@entity4 is in favour of elitism , making the drivers nearly unavailable to the public			2
there is a fashion to decry this , and a call for fans to be allowed into or closer to the paddock and garages			0
fine , if it can be done without damaging the allure and glamour of the spectacle			0
it is to these challenges , and more , that @entity4 returned to his desk .			2

@entity4 free to focus on running @entity13 after bribery case dropped
@entity13 *supremo* pays - out £ 60million settlement
trial which ran for three *months* at @entity40 *district* court was *suspended* after @entity4 offered pay - out
