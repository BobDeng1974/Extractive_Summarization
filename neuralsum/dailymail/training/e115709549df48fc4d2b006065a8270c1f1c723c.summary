by @entity0 it 's becoming a rather annoying ritual for @entity4 viewers			1
you settle down to watch a much - anticipated tv drama – then have to crank up the volume or switch on the subtitles			2
just a month after the @entity4 ’s @entity12 was lambasted for its mumbling actors and poor sound quality , the corporation ’s latest big release , @entity11 , has been hit by the same complaints			1
drama : crime series @entity11 , starring @entity17 , has attracted complaints about its audio quality anger : tv star @entity23 was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the dialogue viewers watching the crime drama on sunday night were furious when they could n’t make out what was being said			1
they reported having to switch on subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting , while others simply gave up and turned it off			0
set in 1950s @entity35 and based on the novels by @entity38 - winning author @entity37 , @entity11 follows the city ’s chief pathologist , played by @entity17 , as he investigates a murder			1
@entity42 's take on the silent drama @entity11 but it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three - part series struggled to follow the action , with tv presenter @entity23 leading the complaints on @entity51			1
@entity23 blamed the @entity4 ’s sound editing , writing : ‘ was really looking forward to @entity11 , @entity4 , 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent , still ca n’t hear at least a third of dialogue ! again ! ‘ and it ’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly			1
back to @entity11 , and inaudible			0
grrrrrr ! ! ! ! ’ he persevered with the programme a little longer , then finally announced : ‘ oh well , i give up			0
throws ear - trumpet away and hobbles upstairs to bed , prematurely aged by c * * * c * * * c * * * @entity64 sound			0
’ another viewer also blamed the quality of the sound editing , tweeting : ‘ i spend 99 per cent of my time with subtitles ! i ’m 35 ... @entity4 buy new [ microphones ]			2
’ but others blamed the actors for failing to enunciate properly , likening the effect to the mumbling cast of @entity12			2
one viewer wrote : ‘ trying to enjoy @entity4 ’s @entity11 but too much mumbling and not enough enunciation ! @entity12 revisited ? ’ before changing channels , another tweeted : ‘ we turned over , ca n’t be bothered with whispers			1
’ they were n’t alone in turning off the programme in frustration			0
stars : @entity11 features actors such as sir @entity84 , left , and @entity85 , right notorious : @entity12 rapidly became known for its problems with inaudible dialogue another @entity51 user wrote : ‘ how far into @entity11 did you get tonight ? shades of @entity12 – mumbling and dark			0
was this same director ? turned off yet another drama ! ’ after it was broadcast over @entity93 , @entity12 generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘ incoherent mumbling ’			2
the @entity4 originally said that technical faults were responsible but following an investigation admitted another problem was that some of the cast had failed to deliver their lines clearly			0
last night there had been no official complaints to the @entity4 about @entity11 or to television watchdog @entity104			0
responding to the @entity51 row , a spokesman for the @entity4 said : ‘ there were no reported problems or complaints following sunday night ’s opening episode ’			1

@entity35 - based crime drama had first episode on @entity4 at the *weekend*
dozens of viewers took to the *internet* complaining they could not hear it
the row is *reminiscent* of the *controversy* over period drama @entity12
