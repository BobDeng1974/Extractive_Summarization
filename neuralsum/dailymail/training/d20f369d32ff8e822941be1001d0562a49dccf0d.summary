by @entity0 published : 04:41 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 12 june 2013 more than a million over- 65s are still working – double the number 20 years ago , official figures revealed yesterday			2
many stay in employment beyond the retirement age because they need the income , while others enjoy their job too much to quit			1
the figures , from the @entity12 , show 1.03million people who are over state pension age are working – nearly one in ten			1
in 1992 , the first year the @entity12 kept records , only 479,000 worked			1
rise : in the last two decades the number of over- 65s in work has risen sharply from around 430,000 to more than 1million today row : @entity19 and @entity20 clashed in the @entity21 today over the unemployment figures , with the @entity23 ( right ) warning that living standards are falling experts predict the number will continue to rise			1
life expectancy has increased dramatically in the past 40 years , allowing workers to delay their retirement			0
meanwhile pension values have plummeted and savings rates have hit rock bottom , meaning many can not afford to retire			0
others want to continue earning to help out their grown - up children			0
and many older workers insist they enjoy the social interaction , challenge , mental stimulation and sense of achievement that they get from their job			2
@entity42 , chief executive of the @entity43 , said : ‘ we are seeing big changes in the age profile of the typical workplace , and the process is far from over			0
‘ workers are becoming more flexible about their retirement and the @entity49 is moving away from a black - and - white model of being either a worker or a pensioner			0
‘ people are choosing to stay on at work for a few more years , or are working part - time			2
unfortunately , many of these older workers would rather retire but find that they do not have the savings or pension to do so			0
‘ uncertainty about the economy and historically low annuity rates are also prompting many of them to stay on the payroll for a bit longer			0
’ the trend is also fuelled by a change in the law allowing workers to stay in their jobs for as long as they want and not being forced out at 65 , and the increase in the state pension age – to 66 for both men and women by 2020 – with further increases to follow			1
bumpy : the uncertain recovery continues with a small increase in the unemployment rate to 71.6 per cent , still down on the 73 per cent peak five years ago benefits : @entity83 claimants fell last month but the numbers are still much higher than the levels seen before the financial crash and subsequent recession @entity89 , of the @entity88 , said : ‘ this is just the latest evidence that older people are struggling to manage on their pensions and are often forced to carry on working as the only way to make ends meet			1
the unemployment rate varies from 6.2 per cent in the @entity96 to 10.1 per cent in the @entity97 , the @entity12 said			1
@entity97 131,000 unemployed ( +4,000 ) unemployment rate 10.1 % @entity99 273,000 ( -28,000 ) 7.9 % @entity100 and the @entity101 244,000 ( -2,000 ) 8.9 % @entity102 179,000 ( +1,000 ) 7.8 % @entity103 259,000 ( +19,000 ) 9.4 % @entity104 208,000 ( +1,000 ) 6.7 % @entity105 366,000 ( +1,000 ) 8.5 % @entity106 297,000 ( -2,000 ) 6.6 % @entity96 168,000 ( +12,000 ) 6.2 % @entity107 125,000 ( - ) 8.4 % @entity108 194,000 ( -6,000 ) 7.1 % @entity109 68,000 ( -5,000 ) 7.8 % ‘ but the answer is n’t to keep people working when young people are struggling to find jobs			1
’ @entity115 , of pensions advisers @entity114 , said the knock - on effect of the growing number of older workers was ‘ a matter of great concern ’			0
he warned : ‘ unless or until economic stimulus can provide many more jobs , today ’s unemployed may well become the impoverished pensioners of the future			2
’ the @entity12 figures also showed @entity49 unemployment fell by 5,000 between february and april to 2.51million , and there are a record number in work – 29.7million			1
the percentage of the working - age population in employment is 71.5 per cent , compared with 50 per cent in @entity134 and 54 per cent in @entity135			2
of the 432,000 extra jobs created in the past year , nearly two - thirds have gone to women , who make up nearly half the workforce – 13.8million			2
the continuing financial squeeze means the number of stay - at - home mothers has dropped again , by 34,000 between february and april			0
job vacancies are the highest since the 2008 banking crisis , at 516,000			0
but @entity145 , chief economist at the @entity146 , said businesses were struggling to find people with the right skills			0
the number of private sector jobs has risen sharply since a low of 22.5million after the 2008 financial crash spending cuts and a renewed focus on creating private sector jobs has seen the number of people working for the state tumble from 6.3million to 5.7million			1

1 in 10 people aged over 65 has a job , up from one in 2020 in 1993
ministers warn everyone will have to work beyond *70*
