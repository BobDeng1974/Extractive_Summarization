by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 19 november 2013 every year on @entity1 , the stars taking part reveal how they dropped pounds thanks to rehearsing and performing and they leave the show the fittest they 've ever been			2
now strictly professional dancers @entity6 and @entity8 , along with former contestant @entity9 , want to help the show - loving public get the same results by launching a dance workout called @entity13			1
the 45 minute class is similar to @entity15 - so you do n't need a partner - and it includes moves from @entity19 and ballroom dances			1
meanwhile , a range of slower movements and postures from the @entity41 and the @entity42 use muscular strength to tone the torso , arms and legs			0
@entity6 , 33 , told the @entity47 : ' it 's an intense workout but because you 're concentrating on learning the steps and having fun dancing , you do n't notice how hard you 're working			1
' she added : ' what 's also exciting about it is you 're learning a skill as we teach the basic foundation of ballroom and @entity59 dancing			2
you do n't even need to try and convince your reluctant partner to join you , as you 'll be working out alongside a whole class of like - minded people			1
you 'll get fit , boost your confidence , make friends and have a great time doing so			0
' join in : the classes are operating at 700 venues around the country @entity6 has been dancing since she was three - years - old and she said the classes are suitable for adults of all ages ( they 're working on launching a separate @entity13 class for children )			1
she said participants can burn up to 600 calories a session and those already taking part in the classes around the country have been seeing the results			1
@entity82 , who attends classes in @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ' it 's the best thing i 've done in years			2
the support , the atmosphere , drive and fun keep me coming back			0
the first time i tried it i thought to myself , " this is something i will never get right " , but class after class , the steps got easier and more achievable			0
' i 'm enjoying myself and best of all my body is getting firmer			2
so i 've said " goodbye love handles " and my bum is lifted like never before			0
i am feeling much more confident in my own skin			0
' many celebrities who have taken part in the @entity107 show also attest that they 've slimmed down thanks to dancing			2
convert : @entity110 swimmer @entity9 , right , said he loved learning to dance and lost weight when he appeared on @entity1			1
he joined forces with @entity8 and @entity6 to help other people have the experience he enjoyed the @entity1 effect : this year 's contestant @entity117 , left , has already lost 7lb , while @entity118 dropped two stone when he took part in 2008 one contestant this year , @entity117 , has admitted she 's lost @entity123 so far and in previous series , actor @entity121 and presenter @entity118 shed more than two stone each			1
and it 's not just their waistlines that benefit from taking part , many of them also come away with a newfound love of dancing thanks to being taught by a professional			2
it 's something @entity110 swimmer @entity9 experienced after his appearance on the show in 2008			1
' i had a great time when i was on the show but when i realised how much weight i 'd lost , i wanted to explore the concept of getting fit through stepping , ' he said			0
' after speaking to some professional fitness colleagues and then reaching out to @entity6 , it turned out that @entity8 had already been working on a similar concept , so after much discussion and development we joined forces and @entity13 was born			1
' @entity8 added : ' the great thing about @entity13 is that it ’s varied			1
because of the differences in techniques and tempo of the dances , the postures are grouped together to create different effects on the body and achieve the results you want			1
there 's absolutely no way you ’ll have as much fun pounding the treadmill as you will learning to @entity34			0
' dance into shape : up to 600 calories can be burnt per class as moves from @entity19 and ballroom routines are learnt @entity6 said the classes teach the same basic dance moves that the celebrities learn when they first sign up for @entity1			1
it 's only when they 've started to master these that their professional partner will teach them the choreographed routines			0
the @entity179 dancer - whose biggest success on @entity1 came when she reached the final with @entity183 actor @entity182 in 2009 - said it 's rewarding to be able to reach so many people through @entity13			1
she explained : ' i love dancing , it 's good for the heart , the soul and the mind			0
dancing is in my blood and i love teaching the celebrities i 've worked with on @entity1			0
but you are only teaching one person			0
these classes allow us to reach thousands of people and help them get fit while having fun			0
' @entity13 classes are being run in 700 locations around the country in gyms and community centres as well as at @entity207 health spas and @entity208			1
but of course @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity9 ca n't teach all the classes themselves so 1,200 licenced instructors have been trained in order to deliver the workout			1
missing the show : @entity6 on last year 's strictly with cricketer @entity217			2
she 's had to sit out this year as she recovers from a foot injury looking head , @entity6 said they plan to launch the children 's classes as well as aqua @entity13 ( the workout in water ) and ' golden era ' @entity13 - a class at a slower pace focusing on ballroom dancing to music from the 30s and 40s			1
@entity6 has been unable to take part in this year 's @entity1 after suffering from a foot injury and so has been a keen - if not a little jealous - viewer instead			1
she said : ' i 'm gutted i could n't take part in this year 's series after getting two stress fractures in my foot			2
i 've been resting and recovering so there 's a chance i might be able to take part in the group numbers towards the end of the series			0
but i will have to see how i am , i want to make sure i 'm recovered so i 'm definitely back next year			0
' when it comes to who 'll make the final this year , she thinks it 's too close to call			0
' the competition is heating up , ' she exclaimed			0
' the girls like @entity253 and @entity117 have been great from the start but now the boys are upping the ante as @entity257 and @entity258 are improving every week			0
i could n't pick a winner			0
