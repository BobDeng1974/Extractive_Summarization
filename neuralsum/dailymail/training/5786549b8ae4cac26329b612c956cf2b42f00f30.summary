by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 29 august 2013 @entity2 : 10:42 est , 30 august 2013 what could be more heartwarming than a picture of one of the world ’s most eligible bachelors doting over the lady carrying his child ? perhaps a whole series of them ? for over the past week , the public has been treated to a host of pictures documenting @entity17 ’s blossoming romance with @entity18 , the @entity19 socialite who is three months pregnant			1
but why go to the beach when you have a private yacht in the bay ? @entity34 : 8/10 still on the beach , it ’s the ' lovers strolling through the surf picture ' , always a classic			2
but they need to work on hand - holding - @entity17 seems to be just clutching on to her pinkie			1
@entity34 : 8/10 what better way to be seen in @entity27 than taking a spin along the seafront in an exotic open top sports car ? the only problem with choosing a classic @entity47 of the type favoured by @entity49 is that it will turn more heads than you do			2
@entity34 : 2/10 somehow , photographers always seem to know exactly where to find the couple			2
and , gosh , are n’t they obliging when they are found ? holding hands , strolling through the surf and , most peculiarly , kissing at an outdoor table of @entity59 — an oddly public place to go when you are worth £ 220 million and could take your pick of @entity64 ’s secluded restaurants			2
but it ’s clear the usually private @entity17 , 53 , has never been keener to be pictured			1
apparently he is so nervous about the negative publicity surrounding his affair with @entity18 — who was married to @entity17 ’s friend , real estate tycoon @entity69 , when she became pregnant — that he ’s desperate to show the world how in love they are			1
@entity18 puts on another show at an outdoor cafe in @entity27			0
but @entity17 has the body language of an embarrassed man			1
@entity34 : 8/10 later they look indulgently at a cute little girl			0
the intended message ? that they 'll make fabulous parents in february			0
@entity34 : 10/10 @entity17 and @entity18 board a private jet to @entity64 from @entity82			1
there is a lovely view here of their matching bumps			0
both look suitably glossy and masters of the universe - ish			0
@entity34 : 2/10 leaving his @entity64 house on his way to @entity94 , or baby , it is hard to say			0
what the @entity97 sign means is anyone 's guess			2
@entity34 : 1/10 to the @entity59 in @entity101			0
everything about @entity17 's straight - backed posture and nonchalant chin - in - hand pose says ' act natural ' - yet the effect is quite the opposite			1
@entity34 : 10/10 still hungry ? they arrive later at @entity109 's restaurant in @entity110			2
@entity17 looks a little distracted as @entity18 plants a peck on his cheek			1
@entity34 : 2/10 a source close to @entity17 tells me : ‘ he was appalled by the reaction to the initial story , that he had run off with his best friend ’s wife			1
‘ it made him look a right nasty b * * * * * *			0
he has been advised to keep it as quiet as he possibly can , but she was pressing to come out and see him			0
@entity17 is hoping that people will see it as a love story , and wish him luck			1
’ yet his seemingly staged @entity130 may have backfired			0
critics online have declared them ‘ shameless ’ , ‘ so contrived , ’ and ‘ cringey ’			0
picture research : @entity134 in the company of not - very - publicity - shy @entity136 , @entity17 and @entity18 are certainly getting the hang of this thing for @entity130			1
she has a lovely smile and a pretty pink dress , but their bodies remain as stiff as a couple of mannequins in a shop window			0
@entity34 : 9/10 @entity17 is showing off even more cleavage than her in a shirt open to the waist			1
this clinch ought to be intimate at the end of a romantic evening , but it is simply unconvincing			0
@entity34 : 9/10 a classic in - car shot , with @entity18 looking radiant but clingy and @entity17 a picture of smug satisfaction			2
he permitted a lot of these kind of shots to be taken when he was with his now - discarded fiancee @entity161 , too			0
and , another thing : @entity109 's is a favourite restaurant of @entity17 's pr guru @entity164			1

for the past week the public have seen pictures documenting romance
it 's clear usually private @entity17 , 53 , has never been keener to be pictured
