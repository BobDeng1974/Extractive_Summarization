@entity1 's plan to cut university tuition fees is facing internal opposition with predictions it could cause a civil war within the party @entity1 's plan to cut university tuition fees was yesterday facing mounting opposition - with even a former @entity10 aide joining the attack			1
there were predictions last night that the party could descend into civil war over the controversial proposals after @entity18 aide @entity17 was joined by the leader of @entity21 's nurses in challenging the plans			1
mr @entity1 has said his pledge to slash the fees from £ 9,000 a year to £ 6,000 is ' cast - iron ' , adding the plan will be a ' red line ' in any possible future coalition talks			1
but the plan – to be paid for by cutting middle - class pension pots – has been condemned as ' financial illiteracy ' by some critics , while university chiefs warn it could jeopardise the scrutiny of their long - term funding			1
the policy has also led to more than four years of rows within the @entity39 , with claims that @entity41 repeatedly warned mr @entity1 that the £ 2.9billion fees cut was difficult to fund			1
mr @entity17 , speaking in his capacity as director general of the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , joined a growing number of pensions experts to challenge @entity10 's plans			2
mr @entity17 , who worked for mr @entity18 from 2005 to 2006 and is also a former adviser to ex-home secretary @entity51 , said : ' the pensions and long - term savings industry supports reform of tax relief but this is not the way to do it			0
' we need a focus on reforming the pension tax relief system as a whole to make it fairer , better value and encourage saving from middle earners , rather than piecemeal cutting back the existing system to pay for other policy objectives			1
' under the @entity10 plan , tax relief for pensioners with incomes more than £ 150,000 would be cut from 45p to 20p while the tax - free lifetime allowance on a pension would drop from £ 1.25million to £ 1million			1
but the proposals could also hit people due to retire with a pension pot worth just £ 26,000 a year from an annuity while young people saving just £ 400 a month may also be affected			2
the plans have led to fears nurses , teachers and firefighters could also be hit			0
dr @entity81 , of the @entity82 , said : ' helping students financially is important			0
however , this must not be at the expense of hard - working nurses			0
we will examine these proposals to ensure their pensions will not be affected			0
' last night the comments were seized on by health secretary @entity92			0
he wrote to his @entity10 opposite number , @entity94 , saying : ' i wanted to ensure you are fully aware of the impact of this announcement on @entity100 staff			2
for example , if a nurse team leader earning around £ 35,500 , who is in a final salary , defined benefit pension scheme , achieves the promotion to matron they have been working 25 years to achieve , they will face a tax charge of £ 5,000 on their pension pot. this is what happens when policies are not properly thought through			0
' but mr @entity1 has claimed the pensions raid would hit only the very wealthy			0
he said : ' the scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people , it is a burden on our country			2
' mr @entity1 pictured at @entity119 yesterday , where he announced his plan to slash tuition fees			1

@entity1 is facing internal opposition over plans to slash tuition fees
he announced this week that @entity10 would cut fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000
but the fee *reductions* are to paid for by cutting middle - class pension pots
it is now predicted the party could descend into civil war over his policy
