attempting to move past her now infamous ' dead broke ' gaffe , @entity0 sought to empathize with low - income women on friday at event in @entity4 by opening up about the difficulties she faced as a young mother more than 30 years ago @entity7 , who is a presumed 2016 presidential candidate , has struggled to relate to average @entity25 throughout her political career			1
even before her cringe - worthy comment earlier this summer about her financial woes , @entity7 faced criticism for being too closed off and unapproachable.the former @entity32 senator 's chilly demeanor has often been cited as a contributing factor to her 2008 loss in the @entity36 presidential primary			1
since leaving the @entity38 administration , @entity7 has taken steps to soften her image ahead of a second , possible presidential campaign , embarking on a nationwide book tour earlier this summer and headlining an iconic steak fry fundraiser in @entity44 last week			1
@entity7 reportedly spent her summer vacation in the @entity46 asking friends for advice on how to talk about economic inequality			1
the former lawmaker appeared to try out her improved message in @entity4 this week during two women 's events sponsored by leading @entity36 organizations			2
on thursday @entity7 participated in a roundtable discussion on the obstacles working women face that was held at the @entity59 , a progressive think tank founded by @entity61 alum @entity60			1
this afternoon she appeared at the @entity63 's annual women 's leadership forum			2
in her remarks at the @entity36 event , @entity7 said she was approached at the roundtable by a woman from @entity68 who lost her job last winter because she was unable to obtain reliable childcare for her autistic son when the city 's schools shut down due to bad weather			1
' as i sat there listening to her story , i remembered how i felt as a young mother , so many years ago , ' @entity7 said			1
' there was one morning when i was due in court at 9:30 for a trial			0
it was already 7:30 , and @entity83 , just two years old , was running a fever and throwing up			0
' my husband was out of town , the normal babysitter called in sick with the same symptoms , i had no relatives living nearby , my neighbors were not home , and so , frantic , i called a trusted friend who came to my rescue , ' she recalled			0
' still i felt terrible that i had to leave my sick child at all			2
and i called back every break in the trial , and i rushed home as soon as court adjourned			0
' when i opened the door and saw my friend reading to @entity83 , who was clearly feeling better , my head and stomach stopped aching for the first time that day			0
' but for many parents , @entity7 said , ' that ache is with them every single day			2
' ' the most vulnerable families in our country have the least support			0
' ' i had many more advantages , much more support , and yet i too felt that squeeze , ' @entity7 said , comparing her situation to that of other working mothers while speaking at the @entity63 's annual women 's leadership forum in @entity4 women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs , she said , and ' without flexibility , or predictability , without access to quality affordable childcare , without paid family leave , ' it 's ' no wonder there were 5.1 million more women in poverty than men last year			1
' ' no wonder so many @entity25 families are hurting today , ' she continued			0
' for too many women for too many families , they do n't just face ceilings on their dreams , it feels to them as though the floor has collapsed beneath their feet			0
' that 's not how its supposed to be in @entity25			0
this is the country where if you work hard , you can make it			0
' @entity7 has not officially announced her candidacy for president in 2016 , and it 's unclear if she 'll actually enter the race			1
at last week 's steak fry she acknowledged that that she was considering another campaign but left it at that			2
if she does run for president again , she 's expected to breeze through the @entity36 primary			2
in the general election , however , she could face stiff competition from several @entity162 politicians , including @entity164 sen. @entity163 and @entity166 rep. @entity165			0
both are known for their compelling personal stories and ability to speak plainly to @entity25 .			0
