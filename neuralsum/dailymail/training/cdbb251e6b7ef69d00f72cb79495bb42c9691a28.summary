the @entity1 nurse who survived @entity2 has criticised the international response to the crisis as being ' woefully slow ' , after returning to help treat victims in @entity6			1
the 29 - year - old , from @entity8 , @entity9 , said arriving back to the country where he contracted the deadly disease , he was left shocked at ' seeing so many dead people '			1
he returned to @entity13 last month , and is treating patients in an @entity2 isolation unit run by @entity1 medical staff in @entity17 , the capital of @entity6 - one of the three countries worst hit by the epidemic			1
the outbreak has killed almost 5,200 people , almost all in @entity13 , according to the @entity22			2
@entity22 experts said yesterday they hope the numbers of cases will start falling sharply in the new year as they stressed the need to develop new diagnostic tests to identify the disease in the later stages of the outbreak			2
' ' we 're not saying it 's over , ' he stressed , but added that the @entity22 hopes that by march the three countries worst hit by this outbreak - @entity6 , @entity45 and @entity46 - will be seeing between five and 10 cases a week			1
but four months into the crisis in @entity6 the number of cases are still rising			2
mr @entity32 said vast numbers of people , including young children are dying because of the ' slow ' response by @entity56 nations and the @entity57 the nurse , who described seeing between eight to 10 corpses a day , said : ' the response has been woefully slow			1
' people do n't have any appreciation of the numbers of people , little kids that are dying			2
' because people are being too slow back in @entity56 and the @entity67 and elsewhere			2
' he is working at the @entity69 in @entity17 , run by @entity1 - based @entity71 's @entity70			0
the 18 - bed @entity2 isolation ward is full , meaning one victim has to recover or pass away from the disease before another person can be helped			2
a screening tent in the hospital grounds holds those people medics suspect are infected			0
currently mr @entity32 said there are four people waiting to for treatment inside the tent , some will likely perish there			1
' we 've got one bed at the moment and there 's four suspects in the tent , ' he said			0
the @entity92 reported all four patients appear terrified			0
mr @entity32 said vast numbers of people , including young children are dying because of the ' slow ' response by @entity56 nations and the @entity57 he was repatriated to the @entity1 in august after being contracting the virus while he worked in the @entity100 , in eastern @entity6 he was treated at the @entity101 in @entity102 where he was given the experimental drug @entity103			1
he was discharged after fully recovering on september 3 one , a woman , lies on the floor retching			0
despite her dire state , visibly reeling from the effects of the vicious disease , this woman is one of the ' lucky ' ones			0
mr @entity32 decides she will move to inhabit the free bed on the isolation ward , while her fellow victims inside the tent will have to wait			1
as @entity117 approaches the 29 - year - old 's mind is clear			1
while the thought of celebrating at home in @entity9 is obviously appealing , his duty is to remain on the front line where he can make a difference			0
' the thought of @entity117 at home is great in some ways , ' he said			0
' but you 're not going to be able to switch off and enjoy your roast and relaxing with your family when you know what 's going on here			0
' when you know what you should be doing			0
' mr @entity32 was the first confirmed @entity133 to contract @entity2			1
he was flown back to the @entity1 in august , where he was treated at @entity102 's @entity101			1
he received the experimental drug @entity103 , and was discharged from hospital on september 3 after making a full recovery			1
last month he made the decision to return to @entity13 , driven by his desire to help the people and communities at the heart of the catastrophic outbreak , the most deadly since @entity2 was first discovered by scientists in 1976			1
in october mr @entity32 returned to @entity6 with the @entity71 's @entity70 to treat victims on an isolation ward at @entity17 's @entity69 a health worker from @entity6 's @entity148 carried the corpse of a child in @entity17 another corpse is removed from a home in @entity17			1

the virus , which emerged in a small village in @entity45 last december , has ravaged the country , as well as neighbouring @entity6 and @entity46			0
in august the @entity22 declared the crisis , an international emergency			0
a @entity1 patient is currently awaiting results of a test to establish whether he has @entity2 , after arriving at a gp clinic in @entity178 on monday with diarrhoea and reporting he had recently travelled to @entity13			2
on sunday , @entity180 announced plans to invest a further £ 1.34 million with the @entity182 , in new research to fight the deadly virus			0
