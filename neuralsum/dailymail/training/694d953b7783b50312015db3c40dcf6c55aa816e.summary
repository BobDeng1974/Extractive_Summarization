by @entity0 a rare auction is giving space enthusiast the chance to get their hands on the world ’s fastest rocket			2
dubbed the @entity9 rocket system , the machine is driven by a cryogenically cooled liquid hydrogen called scramjet and can reach speeds of up to 4,310mph ( 6900km/h )			1
the rocket was the result of a £ 60 million ( $ 101 million ) project between @entity17 and the @entity18 and was completed in the early 1990s			1
@entity20 rocket system , which can reach speeds of up to 4,310mph ( 6900km/h ) , is up for auction it had previously held the world record for outright atmospheric speed between 1991 and 2001 after reaching a staggering @entity25 ( 4,310mph )			1
this is twice the speed of the fastest ever aircraft , the @entity28			2
it remains the fastest ' serially produced ' machine to have ever travelled within the @entity32 's atmosphere and is now up for grabs with @entity34			1
nine @entity9 rockets were made between 1991 and 1998 , but five of the nine were destroyed during test flights			2

this is because rockets combine a liquid fuel with liquid oxygen to create thrust			0
ake away the need for liquid oxygen and a spacecraft can be smaller or carry more payload			0
that 's the idea behind a propulsion called ' scramjet , ' or @entity59			2
the oxygen needed by the engine to combust is taken from the atmosphere passing through the vehicle , instead of from a tank onboard			0
the craft becomes smaller , lighter and faster			0
scramjets work by gathering up air , forcing it into a combustion chamber where the fuel ( usually hydrogen ) is burned , generating thrust that keeps the craft going			0

one of the remaining rockets was purchased by a private collector in the @entity80 with the others on show at the @entity83 in @entity84			0
@entity85 , managing director at @entity86 , said : ' we have sold some unusual and interesting vehicles in our time			0
' but a hypersonic rocket just about tops the list of the most remarkable objects we 've ever presented			0
' in all seriousness , the @entity9 is a truly significant piece of history			2
' its sale presents an once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for serious collectors of aerospace memorabilia			0
' the rocket will be put up for auction in @entity102 in @entity103 on september 8			1
it currently has no price estimate or reserve			1
