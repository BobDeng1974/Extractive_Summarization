when @entity2 ’s traumatic campaign under @entity3 shuddered to its lowest depths last season , there was a theory circulating that the on - field turmoil may have very serious ramifications for the club ’s off - field credentials			1
there was certainly some substance to this suggestion			0
the sliding share prices - from just under 19p before sir @entity15 ’s retirement to hovering around 14p during the darkest moments of @entity3 ’ reign in february this year - demonstrated concrete proof of that			0
without @entity15 holding the reins of power at @entity24 , questions were asked			0
he was the club ’s most reliable asset , a guarantee of glory			0
some season ticket holders will have privately pondered whether the yearly investment was still worth the trouble			0
in six games against @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , @entity2 ’s aggregate score was 1 - 14			1
there would be no @entity54 football for at least one year			0
so how can it be , just two months after the curtain came down on @entity2 ’s worst league finish in 24 years that the club were able to announce an extraordinary , record - breaking £ 750million decade - long kit deal with adidas ? the figures are truly remarkable			1
this agreement more than doubles the £ 31m that @entity63 , the previous biggest recipient , are thought to receive a year from the @entity66 firm			1
the £ 75m per year that @entity2 will receive from adidas alone is only narrowly less than the £ 76m turnover that @entity69 posted in 2012 - 13 season			1
in the same year , @entity71 recorded £ 83.7m turnover			1
it offers some idea of the now obscene financial might of @entity2			2
this , of course , only takes into account @entity2 ’s deal with adidas			2
@entity2 will also receive £ 51m annually from shirt sponsors @entity36 for the next seven years as well as a £ 17m windfall per year from @entity83 , who have purchased the rights to plaster their name across the club ’s training kit , while they also sponsor the @entity90 training ground			1
only on wednesday did @entity2 announce yet another sponsorship , this time with international food brand @entity92			2
boost : @entity2 have already splurged cash on midfielder @entity95 ( left ) and @entity97 's @entity96 on and on : sir @entity15 was always a guaranteed deliverer of success as manager at @entity24 how much ? @entity83 pay £ 17m - a - year to sponsor the @entity90 complex and the club 's training kit these three principal sponsorship deals will combine to provide @entity2 with an annual income in excess of £ 140m , dwarfing the turnover of 14 @entity109 clubs			1
perversely , it would seem that @entity2 ’s dismal dalliance with @entity3 has , if anything , only amplified the intrigue and lure that surrounds this famous football club			2
last week , @entity2 launched ‘ reunited ’ , essentially a glorified corporate event for the friendly match against @entity117 in august that will mark @entity42 ’s first match at @entity24			1
this is emblematic of the brand that @entity2 are now trying to promote			2
a club clawing its way back to the peak of the mountain , ambitious and determined to return to the pinnacle of the sport in a brave , new era under @entity129			0
it only underlines just how important the decision to part with @entity3 had become			0
it was not taken lightly but it was incredibly necessary			0
a wave of optimism , boosted by the performance of @entity129 at the @entity135 and arrivals of @entity96 and @entity95 , is now sweeping through @entity24			1
looking bleak : the financials behind the club were on the slide with @entity3 in charge last season @entity2 wore their poker faces and played a high - stakes game of negotiating to secure this landmark deal , holding lengthy discussions with @entity39 , @entity147 and @entity148 - a @entity150 firm - before eventually agreeing the contract with adidas			2
@entity2 may still come to an arrangement with @entity148 in the coming year , further maximising their revenue potential and expanding the brand in the @entity156			1
even despite concerns surrounding the team ’s performances , @entity157 had the gumption to allow the @entity39 deal to run down and the increasing variety of brands on show at the club ’s @entity90 training ground was seen by the company as a hostile act			0
now , of course , he can reflect with pride			0
but what if ? what if @entity3 had been kept on ? would adidas have risked so much if @entity3 had remained in charge ? we may never know but nobody can deny the spectre of doom that had engulfed @entity24 in those final , tortuous months of last season			0
perception is everything in the modern world of business and companies want to be associated with clubs that evoke confidence and self - belief			0
@entity2 under @entity129 has the look of a force to be reckoned with , before a ball has even be kicked			2
decent move : chief executive @entity157 let @entity39 's deal to run down in favour of a more lucrative contract @entity196 is the brains behind the commercial operation at @entity24 , the man who , along with @entity200 , has worked hard to service the club ’s debt by extending @entity2 ’s reach to @entity205 beer , @entity207 tyres , @entity209 watches and @entity150 paint , to mention four of the 28 sponsors listed on the club ’s website			1
the majority of these are worth around £ 2m to @entity2 but it all adds up a remarkable annual income			1
@entity157 , an @entity217 boy , is tremendously close to the @entity219 family , speaking almost daily with @entity219 and he was one of those investment bankers - working for @entity221 at the time - that pushed through the takeover in 2005			0
the @entity224 will feel that their prodigy is now proving his worth in the big job at @entity2 , despite the teething issues that he suffered last summer after taking over from @entity229			2
football should never be judged by the spreadsheet but if the on - field showings can mirror the rosy picture now adorning @entity157 ’s financial charts , then @entity2 supporters may be in for a very exciting season indeed			0
