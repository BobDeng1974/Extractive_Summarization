by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 2 november 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 2 november 2013 historic : @entity2 , 68 , found a fossil from 250million years ago in 1997			1
but put it in his shed it 's not every day someone finds the priceless bone of a dinosaur - aged sea killer in their garden			1
but when 68 - year - old @entity2 came across a pliosaur fossil while building a fence in 1997 , he was in no rush to do anything about it			1
the retired merchant banker , who lives in @entity17 , put the fossil in his shed - and left it there for 16 years			1
finally , he decided to take it to @entity22 last week , where experts , astounded , confirmed it to be the bone of a 250 - million - year - old reptile			1
the 16 - inch bone , thought to be an upper limb , weighs 15lbs			1
mr @entity2 said he put it in the shed as he could tell it was worth keeping - but getting it checked out was never a priority			1
' life get 's on top of you does n't it , ' he said			0
' it did look like a really big bone that was tremendously heavy and i had earmarked that i would take it for identification but never did			0
' then one day i thought , " what happened to that bone ? " and i found it in the workshop			2
' i phoned the museum and they said " bring it in , we 'd love to have a look at it "			0
' the pliosaur , a 65 - foot - long sea - based predator , was a distant cousin of the modern lizard			2
with sharp teeth and paddle - like limbs , they were fast and fierce , scientists believe			0
their prey included fish , sharks and dinosaurs			0
fossil specimen have been found in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and the @entity66			2
dinosaur - age : @entity22 confirmed the bone belonged to a pliosaur , a water - based predator experts at the @entity22 have determined that the pliosaur was not native to the @entity75 sea , making the finding even more mysterious			1
mr @entity2 said : ' it is rather fun			2
' i 've been here 29 years and we 've got eight acres of ground			0
' we 're keen on the gardening side and i can honestly say we 've found nothing whatsoever of any kind of value apart from rubbish , so it 's really fun to have found this			0
' it will probably go to the museum now			0
' although it 's not from @entity93 , in that it was n't swimming around here , it is part of @entity93 's heritage			0

@entity2 , 68 , was building a fence in 1997 when he found the bone
he put the fossil in his shed in @entity93 and never got round to *examining* it
finally , experts at @entity22 *declare* it to be a 250m - year - old pliosaur
