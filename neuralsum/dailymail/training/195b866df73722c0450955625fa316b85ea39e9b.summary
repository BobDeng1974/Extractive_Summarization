dog faeces is the scourge of parks and pavements , and figures suggest that 1,000 tonnes of poo is created each day in the @entity6 alone			1
in addition to looking and smelling terrible , the faecal matter can harbour antibiotic - resistant strains of @entity10 and parasites - which , when left on the ground , can seep into sewers , rivers and the sea			1
and now scientists have developed a new genetic test to figure out the extent to which dogs are spreading this bacteria through our waterways			2
researchers have developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water			1
they identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples , rarely found in other animals , and were not found in the human samples			1
technique pictured in the journal @entity32 , @entity33 and his colleagues said waterways are susceptible to many sources of faecal contamination , including sewage leaks and droppings from farm animals and wildlife			2
currently , scientists study these water samples for certain genes in gut bacteria that end up in dog faeces			1
@entity10 , also known as @entity10 , is the name of a germ , or bacterium , that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals			0
there are many types of @entity10 , and most of them are harmless			0
but some can cause bloody diarrhoea , while others , in particular a strain called @entity61 : @entity63 , may also cause kidney failure			0
there are also strains of @entity10 that cause urinary tract infections			0
people can get an e. coli infection by coming into contact with faeces			0
this happens by drinking or eating contaminated food			0
source : @entity75 but , this is not a fail - safe approach , because the microbiota of humans and the pets they live with often overlap , making analysis complicated			1
@entity84 ’ team has developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water			1
they identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples , rarely found in the samples taken from other animals , and were not found in the human samples			1
three in particular – called @entity95 , @entity96 , and @entity97 – were the most specific and sensitive of the markers studied			0
to determine whether this method would work for real - world monitoring , they sampled storm water from a rain garden where people often walk their dogs			1
the technique successfully detected some of the same markers they had identified as evidence for canine waste			2
further tests will be carried out before the system can be used more widely			0

the technique successfully detected some of the same markers they had identified as evidence for canine waste it ’s not just dog faeces that poses a health risk , though			1
seagull droppings on beaches have also been linked to @entity10 bacteria found in beach water			2
to reduce the risk to beachgoers , @entity131 scientists are using border collies as patrol dogs to walk up and down the state ’s beaches each day			0
the dogs were put on patrol by @entity140 last year and are designed to scare the birds away			0
following tests , @entity10 levels were found to have ‘ significantly ’ dropped in the beaches that were being patrolled			0
seagull droppings on beaches have also been linked to @entity10 bacteria found in beach water			2
to reduce the risk to beachgoers , @entity131 scientists are using border collies as patrol dogs ( pictured ) to walk up and down the state ’s beaches each day , and are designed to scare the birds away			0

@entity180 detected these markers in samples of rain water in a garden
