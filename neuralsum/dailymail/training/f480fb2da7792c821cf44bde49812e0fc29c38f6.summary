the door is an angry shade of purple , like every other door in the seven - storey block			1
it has no handle , and no name beside the buzzer – just a heavy lock , and spyhole for checking out unwelcome callers			2
the building is a vast and seemingly impenetrable concrete warren divided into some 600 apartments – or perhaps ‘ boxes ’ would be a better term , given their cramped proportions			2
surrounded by dozens of similarly forbidding , state - owned monstrosities housing some 10,000 @entity23 , the vast majority of @entity21 origin , this is the grim @entity25 enclave where @entity26 was radicalised – and is believed to have plotted the horrific magazine massacre			1
though it is just seven miles from the scene of the carnage , once you pass beneath the thundering @entity50 ring - road and enter this soulless district , you have reached a parallel universe			1
half a century ago , @entity44 was an archetypically @entity54 community , as illustrated by the charming sepia photographs hanging in the @entity57 brasserie , opposite the town hall , showing people dining on shady terraces , and riding bicycles in their berets			1
then , the faces were almost all @entity64			2
today , you can walk the length of a crowded boulevard here without seeing a solitary white @entity54 , and the idyllic ambience lives only in the memory of the very few older residents who remain			1
it has been replaced by a menacing edginess , and – when approached by a @entity73 reporter seeking to understand why young @entity54 - @entity74 are turning to @entity76 extremism , apparently in ever increasing numbers – a deeply ingrained sense of mistrust			1
a decade ago , after the incendiary @entity25 race riots of 2005 , i ventured to another of these seething ‘ banlieues ’ , to be greeted with extraordinary courtesy by youths who had , a few hours earlier , been hurling petrol bombs			2
then , they were eager to air their deep sense of disaffection			2
yesterday , in the @entity74 café and kebab shop @entity93 frequented , i met with shrugs of indifference and hostile stares			0
it was left to @entity98 , president of his local mosque where 3,000 people worship each friday , to explain why , for ‘ a tiny minority ’ of young @entity54 muslims , violence was their chosen path			1
a car burns during clashes almost a decade ago in the @entity25 suburb of @entity109 during riots during the @entity116 and @entity117 , he said , when immigrant labourers from @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 were shipped in to rebuild post-war @entity54 , suburbs such as @entity44 ( where they worked mainly in car factories and heavy industrial plants ) were utterly transformed			1
yet for this first generation – well - paid and comparatively well accommodated in the vast new tower blocks built to house them – life was satisfactory enough			2
however , it was not the @entity54 policy even to attempt to integrate or educate them			1
on the contrary , they were pushed to the margins , to be tolerated rather than welcomed , and among the indigenous @entity54 population the level of discrimination was beyond anything we have witnessed in @entity73			1
the problem manifested itself in the second generation – to which @entity93 , an adopted , @entity54 - @entity120 orphan born in the mid-eighties , belonged			1
‘ they saw how their parents were treated and felt deeply resentful , ’ @entity141 told me			0
‘ after the 2005 riots i was among a @entity23 delegation who met @entity147 ( then interior minister ) and i ’ll never forget his words			0
the seven - storey block is where suspect @entity26 ( pictured ) was radicalised - and is believed to have plotted the horrific magazine massacre ‘ he told me that “ to humiliate is to radicalise ” – and that is exactly what came to pass			1
this second generation felt excluded , discriminated against , and most of all , humiliated			0
added to which , they were deeply mixed up – they spoke and felt @entity54 , but were regarded as @entity157 ; they were culturally confused			1
’ among the elders at his mosque , he said there had been lengthy discussions about the offensive @entity39 cartoons , and whenever they were published feelings ran high			1
yet , he maintained , worshippers – particularly the younger ones – were encouraged to accept the principle of free speech , and embrace @entity54 values along with their @entity76 beliefs			1
but @entity93 – an occasional worshipper at the mosque – was among a handful who refused to follow this instruction , he said			0
‘ when the imam told everyone to enrol on the register of electors so they could take part in elections , and play their part in society , he refused			0
he said he was n’t a @entity54 citizen and wanted nothing to do with the democratic process			1
he then walked out of the mosque			0
but these beliefs did n’t come from the imams who teach here			0
he had been who knows where			0
he was using the internet			0
he was crazy ; brainwashed			0
he was beyond our reach			0
’ perhaps so , yet according to one friend , a surly young man who lived in his block who agreed to speak anonymously yesterday , @entity93 was an unlikely killer			2
the sort who would walk up five flights of stairs rather than share the tiny , often uncomfortably crowded lift in his apartment block			1
however , to @entity203 , a 60 - year - old @entity204 - born writer who has lived next door to him for seven years – and saw @entity93 ’s young wife being led away in handcuffs on wednesday afternoon – it came as no surprise that he is being hunted			2
‘ @entity93 wore @entity213 clothes , unlike his wife who dressed traditionally , but he was the type who believes @entity217 is the cure for all life ’s ills , from social problems to depression , ’ he told me			0
‘ you could just tell he was a fanatic			0
’ a ccording to professor @entity227 , a @entity54 expert on political islam , this impression fits perfectly with the stereotype of a frightening new breed of alienated young @entity54 - @entity74 living in the shadowy margins of @entity64 society			1
young men who have been ‘ radicalised through de-culturisation ’ , as he puts it			2
a vast block in @entity44 , which is a seemingly impenetrable concrete warren divided into some 600 apartments ‘ these are second or third generation descendants of immigrants , ’ he told the @entity241			1
‘ they do n’t speak @entity157 ; they do n’t wear traditional @entity74 clothes or eat traditional @entity74 food or listen to traditional @entity74 music			0
they do not speak the language of their parents and have not been educated in religion by them			0
‘ they have the sense that they are living in a disenfranchised ghetto and then there is a process of self - radicalisation ... it is a form of @entity76 totally opposed to any culture , @entity254 or @entity213 , and has its own set of explicit order – do this , do n’t do that			2
the partner of @entity39 editor @entity269 wept last night as she paid tribute to her ‘ hero ’			1
@entity272 , 41 , said : ‘ there will be a before and an after but i have lost @entity269			0
’ the lawyer and ex-government minister hailed the cartoonist , nicknamed @entity277 , and his colleagues , saying : ‘ they were heroes			0
i was with a hero that i loved			0
’ she added : ‘ he was executed because he was defending secularism ... they fought for principles and freedoms that we forgot to defend			0
‘ they died so that we can remain free in this country			0
’ ‘ these young people are out of reach of the traditional @entity23 authorities			0
they do n’t care what the imams say or the leader of the @entity294 in @entity25			0
’ for years , it seems , @entity93 maintained a low profile , living on casual work and , like many young @entity23 ( who claim with some justification to be last in the queue for jobs ) , on welfare handouts			0
his disenchantment hardened into radicalism , and an 18 - month spell in jail			2
given that 80 per cent of @entity54 prisoners are @entity23 , yet no attempt is made to de-radicalise the fundamentalists among them , he emerged festering with even more anger			1
nothing can fully explain the depths of hatred and cold - blooded barbarism that motivated those three young @entity54 on wednesday morning , of course			1
but visiting @entity44 offers a chilling glimpse into the minds of the killers – and you leave with the sombre conviction that , fomenting in those dreadful tower blocks , there are plenty of others who will regard them not as evil monsters			1

seven - storey block is where suspect @entity26 was radicalised
it lies in @entity44 - just seven miles from the @entity39 office
half a century ago it was an archetypically @entity54 community
now you can walk street without seeing a solitary white @entity54
