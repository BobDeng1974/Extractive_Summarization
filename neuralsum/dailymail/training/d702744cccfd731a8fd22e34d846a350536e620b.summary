nobody that day at the @entity1 will forget it			2
the screams of abuse and sobbing relatives in the public gallery as the jury returned its verdict , and actress @entity9 collapsing in a @entity11 swoon of despair and being wheeled to an ambulance			1
it was january 25 , 1994 , and @entity9 , who at that time was playing cafe owner @entity15 in the @entity18 soap opera @entity16 , had sued @entity19 for libel , and lost			1
fundamentally , it was a simple issue			0
she challenged the red - top tabloid after it published a report that a policeman saw her performing a sex act on her fiance in their car while parked in a lay - by			0
her story was that he was not well and she was simply soothing his tummy			0
@entity9 and her then boyfriend @entity33 , who sued the @entity19 for libel even in the richly endowed annals of @entity1 libel actions over the years , this one produced evidence that was uniquely colourful and stark , including film taken at a party some years earlier of the actress simulating sex acts , using a bottle and a sausage			1
added to this was the diminutive , intriguingly soft - voiced figure of the late @entity47 , representing @entity19 , a man about whom it was said in legal circles ‘ does n’t clear his throat for less than £ 10,000 ’			1
so it is hardly surprising that a reconstruction of this hotly contested libel action has been chosen to be the first in a series of court reconstructions , @entity58 , starting tonight on @entity59			1
as the jury heard , it all began 18 months earlier , in june 1992 , when @entity9 and her fiance , @entity33 , went to @entity63 , where he drank champagne			1
as she drove them home in her @entity68 , they stopped in a lay - by on the @entity69 , near @entity70 in @entity71			0
as luck would have it , a police patrol car came by at that moment , and pc @entity75 stopped to check the parked vehicle			2
peering through the @entity68 window , he saw @entity9 with her head on @entity81 ’s lap. he was in no doubt she was performing a sex act , ‘ lying prone ’ across the front seat ‘ with her head moving slightly up and down in mr @entity33 ’s lap ’			1
knights was taken to the police station — @entity9 went to collect their daughter — where he accepted a caution for gross indecency			1
according to another policeman , @entity81 said they ’d had ‘ a good day at the races , the urge got hold of us on the way home — you know how it is ’			0
that might have been the end of the matter — except a story about the arrest later appeared on the front page of @entity19 under the banner headline ‘ tv @entity112 ’			1
a furious @entity9 and @entity81 denied there had been a sex act , but the tabloid refused to back down			1
so the couple sued for libel			2
when the verdict was announced the actress collapsed and had to be taken away by ambulance this was the state of play as the warring parties assembled in @entity125 at the @entity1 on january , 11 , 1994 , with a jury of eight men and four women			1
@entity9 ’s barrister was rangey @entity131 @entity130			1
he told the court that the officer ’s reaction to the @entity69 lay - by incident was ‘ a simple misunderstanding ’			0
what he had , in fact , seen — knights with trousers undone and @entity9 leaning across him — was simply @entity9 trying to comfort @entity81 after he had suffered an attack of pancreatitis			1
she was massaging his stomach because he felt sick after drinking too much champagne			0
in the witness box , the actress wept and said she felt ‘ disgusted ’ and ‘ ashamed ’ of the sex act allegation			0
she shouted at @entity150 , @entity19 ’s barrister , when he accused her of making up her story about @entity81 being unwell ‘ to cover your tracks ’			1
‘ i would never have been able to make up any such lies like that , ’ she snapped			0
‘ how could anyone think that you could stop on the @entity69 for oral sex with cars going by ? ’ asked by her own counsel to describe how @entity19 ’s story made her feel , she replied : ‘ it is so cheap , it makes me feel sick to the stomach			1
’ for his part , wheeler - dealer @entity33 was much more relaxed in the witness box , agreeing he undid his trousers in the lay - by when his girlfriend was comforting him			0
there was an amusing moment when @entity150 asked him to list his criminal convictions and prison sentences			2
‘ what , all of them ? ’ was his reply			0
after which he read aloud a lengthy list including assault and breaking a man ’s jaw			0
at the time , miss @entity9 played @entity15 in the soap @entity16 and has also starred in @entity187 and @entity188 so the battle raged — outside the courtroom as well as in			1
for , to allow the jury to see how the alleged sex act took place , everyone trooped out into the @entity196 car park of the gothic courtroom complex in @entity198			2
led by mr @entity199 , jurors , barristers and members of the @entity203 all formed a circle round a metallic blue @entity68 — the very car at the heart of the case			2
already sitting inside were @entity9 , then 36 , and @entity81 , 38			1
this time , they were about to perform what they claimed really happened in the car — but this time in front of a circle of some 30 people			0
knights sat bolt upright in the front passenger seat			0
@entity9 , wearing a tight black suit with white stitching , leaned towards him and gently patted his stomach			1
on this occasion , @entity81 did not undo his trousers			0
as she went through her patting procedure , @entity9 ’s face was , according to witnesses ‘ a picture of concern ’			1
moments later , two lookalike stand - ins — @entity230 and @entity231 , both journalists on @entity19 — were directed into position in the car by @entity235 to re-enact what he insisted he saw			1
this time , the woman ’s face could not be seen as she buried it in her companion ’s lap while the solemn circle of observers took turns to peer in			0
as the young pair emerged , pink - faced , @entity150 declared the second enactment could not be ‘ exact ’ because the stand - in ’s penis had not been exposed			0
the brilliant @entity248 had n’t finished			0
on the opening day of the second week of the action , he calmly tossed into the case an unexpected bombshell that had been delivered to his legal team over the weekend			2
this was a 35 - minute home - video that had been obtained — for a fee — by @entity257 , the publisher of the @entity19 it had been filmed six years earlier , in 1988 , at the 20th anniversary daytime party of the @entity262 in @entity263 , north @entity264 , and among the guests were the stars of popular tv shows including @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity16			1
@entity150 believed the video contained important character evidence the jury should see			2
@entity275 , for @entity9 , argued it should be inadmissible as court evidence			1
with the jury told by the judge to be absent , they each argued their case			1
eventually , the judge ruled in favour of @entity150			0
at first , as the film was played , the actress occasionally giggled and pointed out people on the screen to @entity81			0
in one clip , the jury saw @entity9 standing in a street , opposite a playground , apparently simulating masturbation with a wine bottle between her legs , and saying : ‘ i could sell my services down the road			1
’ another showed her surrounded by friends and holding a large @entity299 sausage , intermittently in her mouth			0
she was smiling at the camera and saying : ‘ i ’d like to state i give good head ( a slang term for oral sex )			0
i give very good head			0
’ she then asked if anyone ‘ has a battery for it ’			0
after the jury had watched the film , @entity9 went back into the witness box , where she explained she was pretending the sausage was a vibrator			1
more recently miss @entity9 appeared in @entity314 and partnered @entity315 ‘ it was only a joke with a sausage — nothing more than that , ’ she said , ‘ just a joke between friends			2
’ replying to her counsel , she said her sister , a police constable , was also at the party			0
how had she felt , @entity275 asked , when @entity150 accused her of lying to the jury ? ‘ what can i say ? i just think it ’s totally unfair , ’ she said			2
in the closing speeches , @entity150 accused @entity9 of ‘ acting ’ to the jury , while he himself was accused of trying to influence the jury with ‘ magician ’s tricks ’			1
then , after almost two weeks , the jury went out			2
almost five - and - a - half hours later , the jury foreman rose to announce the verdict , and @entity9 ’s left hand could be seen tightly gripping @entity81 ’s wrist			1
‘ oh @entity342 , ’ she gasped , and then she began to sob amid shouts and abuse from friends and family in the public gallery towards the police and even at the judge			0
as @entity150 asked for the couple to pay @entity19 ’s legal costs ( a crippling £ 500,000 ) , the actress ’s mouth opened and she finally collapsed , was carried out to an ambulance , and taken to hospital , where she swiftly recovered			1
the jury ’s decision , it must be said , was not unanimous			2
they found for @entity19 10 - 2			2
@entity150 had suggested @entity9 — the @entity353 daughter of a printer and a cleaning lady — sued to prevent the story damaging her career			1
in fact , although she lost , it seems to have had no impact at all			2
in the 20 years since , @entity9 has scarcely been out of work			2
she has appeared in @entity188 ’ wives and @entity269 , partnered @entity315 in @entity314 in 2008 and was in celebrity big brother last year			0
for several years she has starred in @entity187 , which she is leaving this summer for ‘ family reasons ’			0
she and @entity81 were together for 23 often stormy years and had two children			0
they parted in 2009 and he died last year aged 58 from cancer .			0
