by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 09:04 est , 14 february 2013 jailed : @entity1 has been sentenced to prison for defrauding a pensioner out of £ 60,000 a @entity5 deacon has been jailed after cheating an elderly dementia sufferer out of his life savings and spending the money on gambling and his daughter 's wedding			1
@entity1 persuaded widower @entity12 to sign over power of attorney to him and claimed to be investing in lucrative business deals			1
but instead he took more than £ 60,000 from the vulnerable pensioner to pay for his own mortgage - later telling police that the money had been given to him in return for managing mr @entity12 's finances			1
@entity1 , 65 , was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after being found guilty of theft at @entity23			1
the deacon from @entity25 & @entity5 in @entity26 met mr @entity12 while visiting the pub where he was a landlord before falling ill. the pensioner granted the priest power of attorney over his finances after @entity1 promised he would put it into risk - free business ventures			1
instead , he took £ 61,429 and used it to bet on horse racing and pay off the mortgage on his £ 255,000 house in @entity26			0
he even spent £ 20,000 of mr @entity12 's life savings to pay for a venue for his daughter 's wedding			1
trust : father of five @entity1 , 60 , was a deacon in the @entity43 @entity44 and her new husband @entity45 invited more than 100 guests to a lavish reception at a @entity26 hotel			2

@entity1 - who was so trusted by mr @entity23 that he even officiated at his funeral - was arrested the next year			2
he claimed that the pensioner had paid him £ 20,000 a year to manage his finances , which were ' a pig 's bloody breakfast '			1
but judge @entity57 dismissed @entity1 's version of events as ' preposterous ' , telling the defendant he had carried out a ' planned and careful series of many thefts ' from a man who held him in ' high regard '			1
he added : ' it is tragic to note you evidently held your victim in contempt , as is evidenced by your claim that you were ministering to him in religion during the offending and by derogatory remarks that you made about him			0
' but for your victim 's untimely death , your offending would have continued indefinitely , or at least until you had stolen all that his accounts contained			0
' prosecutor @entity77 told the court that the father of five , who was ordained a deacon in 1992 , had been ' in control of the purse strings ' and thought no one would notice the swindle			0
@entity85 , defending , said @entity1 would find jail difficult because of health problems which included epilepsy and gout			0
church : @entity1 worked at @entity25 and @entity91 church in @entity26 after the case , @entity93 , of @entity94 , said : ' @entity1 was evasive and inconsistent during our dealings with him and it was clear he was not telling the truth			0
' as power of attorney he should have been acting in @entity12 's best interests - instead he acted in his own			2
' he has now paid a high price for that betrayal of trust by losing his liberty			0
' monsignor @entity106 , @entity107 of the @entity108 , said : ' i am saddened to learn that the @entity110 mr @entity1 , a married deacon of our diocese , has been found guilty of theft and a breach of the trust that was placed in him			0
