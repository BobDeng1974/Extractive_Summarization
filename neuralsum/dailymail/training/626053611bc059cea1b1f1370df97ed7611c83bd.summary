a court in @entity1 has ruled that it is not a sackable offence for a man to grope a woman 's breast in the workplace after a mechanic who fondled a cleaner won a legal ruling			1
judges of the @entity12 sitting in @entity13 said that the car mechanic who groped the 26 - year - old while saying ' these look like fun ' should not have been dismissed			1
they ruled that a single instance of groping was tolerable but said that serial fondling should result in the sack			1
the @entity12 sitting in @entity13 , pictured , made the ruling saying that a single instance of groping was ' tolerable ' the mechanic said he did n't know what came over him and paid the woman some compensation but said he was upset to be fired			1
he was sacked in 2012 over the incident and appealed the decision through various courts before it ended up at the @entity13 courthouse this week			0
judges heard that the man had a ' moment of madness ' when he caressed the breasts of the cleaning lady			2
the court was told he made comments about her , and then grabbed hold of her , when he encountered her in the bathroom at the garage where he worked near @entity13			0
she immediately pushed him away and complained to his boss			0
in a conversation with his employer , he admitted the incident and stated that he had ' forgotten for a second ' who he was			0
he apologised to the woman , paid her some money and promised it would not happen again - but he was still sacked for sexual harassment in the workplace			2
after hearing of the circumstances of the case , the apologies of the man and the fact that he was ' sincerely sorry ' the court released a statement about their findings			0
the ruling was made after hearing the case of a mechanic who groped the breasts of a cleaning lady at a garage where he worked ( stock picture ) it said : ' sexual harassment in the workplace must not lead to the immediate termination of the offender			1
' if unethical approaches actually entail a dismissal , it should depend always on the circumstances of the case			0
' the @entity12 said a ' cease and desist ' letter should have sufficed , and that firing the man , aged 37 , who had worked at the firm for 16 years , was a step too far			0
the garage has been ordered to reinstate him but has said it may appeal the verdict			2
the ruling comes after another case dealt with by the court last year when they upheld the sacking of a furniture store employee who liked to continually pat the behinds of female staff members .			1
