@entity0 is planning one of his ' purges ' to rid @entity3 of one of the country 's most powerful figures , after the country 's records reveal that they , not the son of @entity10 , might be the rightful heir to the communist state			1
200 figures in @entity14 are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of @entity3 , because of their loyalty to his uncle , @entity18 , who was executed late last year			1
but @entity20 , currently joint chairman of the powerful @entity21 and political director of the @entity23 has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership			0
@entity0 is again planning a purge of political enemies , with 200 of @entity14 's most powerful on the list , as well as one man who might be a contender to his leadership in the eyes of history new evidence from the 1930s show that it might have been the father of @entity0 's uncle who led the attack against the @entity38 , and that this attack was later claimed by @entity10 's grandfather so they could be the ruling family			1
the attack was a turning point for @entity3 , and helped them to claim a part of the @entity47 back from @entity38 occupation			0
grandfather of @entity0 , @entity50 , is documented in @entity3 's official history as the leader of the 1937 attack on the @entity38 base defending the town of @entity56 , which helped him gain a foothold of legitimacy in the claim of leadership of the country			1
these reports that @entity3 is looking to change it 's history again are not the first incidence of such an occurrence			0
@entity3 regularly changes its own country 's history , with children in the @entity3 being taught that the @entity68 was started in 1950 by an invasion by the @entity70 , and that @entity10 was born in a cabin on the slopes of @entity73 , when historians claim that the late leader was actually born in a refugee camp in the @entity77			2
pictured with @entity0 ( right ) is the person said to be in his target sights , @entity20 , the son of @entity80 , who is thought to the the rightful leader of a battle that helped establish the leadership of @entity3 it was @entity50 ( statue left ) , @entity0 's grandfather who is claimed by @entity3 national media to have been the leader of a famous 1937 attack on the @entity38 now , new reports indicate that it was @entity20 's father , @entity80 , who actually led the attack			1
a report in the @entity95 dated june 7 , 1937 said : ' a little more than 100 men lead by communist bandit @entity97 attacked @entity99			0
' one group attacked the local police station , while another group set fire to the whole village and plundered at will			0
' a second report said : ' they attacked and plundered private houses so @entity99 village has been completely destroyed			0
' @entity0 's other purge targets are said to be supporters of his uncle , @entity18 , who was executed late last year @entity113 , a researcher and human rights activist , says the stories are evidence that the self - styled revolutionaries were bandits in the attack that killed two people , a @entity38 businessman and a two - year - old infant			1
mr @entity113 told @entity122 : ' they set fire to schools and plundered from fellow @entity3 , and it is fair to say they were robbers who were stealing from their own people			0
' @entity50 's legitimacy came from propaganda that he fought against @entity38 , symbolised by the @entity130 the legacy and history of the @entity10 family has been the reason why they are able to cling to the leadership of the totalitarian country , which is why they are targeting any people who could potentially threaten that ' the @entity99 battle made the august name of the president serve as a beacon for the national resurrection for all the @entity3 people and the trust and reverence of the whole @entity3 nation for the president grew more profound			2
' the claim that @entity50 led the battle is reinforced by the @entity154 news agency , an arm of the @entity3 state media , calling @entity50 ' the legendary hero of the anti-japanese war '			2

@entity3 says the famous 1937 battle that helped found the country was led by @entity0 's grandfather @entity50
new evidence suggests the leader of the battle was actually @entity97
@entity80 's son @entity20 is now a target of @entity10 's latest purge
the purge is also targeting 200 powerful @entity14 figures
the 200 are said to be supporters of @entity0 's uncle @entity18
@entity18 was *publicly* executed in *december* last year
