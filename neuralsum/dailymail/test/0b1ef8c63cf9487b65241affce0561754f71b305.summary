the old adage may claim that a liar can not look you in the eye , but in truth liars often stare			1
that 's according to former police officer , @entity6 , who has become the @entity8 's top human leading human lie detector and body expert			1
appearing on @entity12 's @entity11 , the former police officer who has a background in psychology , micro expression training , and neuro linguistic programming ( the study of body signals ) , showed his immense skill in sniffing out deceit			1
he asked @entity30 to conceal a ball and then try and trick him about which hand it was in , but @entity6 managed to spot her fib straight away			1
' i noticed a slight flick on that side of the mouth â€“ a micro expression , ' he said , much to the presenters amazement			0
@entity29 was also caught fibbing , which @entity6 said he detected by a raised eyebrow			1
the full - time human lie detector , who recently sat in on the phone hacking trial , then shared his secrets on the @entity11 website			2
how do you tell if someone is telling porkies ? ' people might clutch a clipboard , file or coffee cup to their chest , creating a subconscious barrier if they 're lying , ' he says			0
' or hold it in two hands			0
@entity6 knew presenter @entity30 was fibbing due to a slight flick on one side of the mouth , much to the presenters amazement			1
' statistically it 's a myth that a liar ca n't look you in the eye			1
three to five seconds of eye contact is normal			2
any longer and they are either in love with you or fibbing			0
he also said that brief answers and hesitation are also signs of lying			2
' liars do n't like being asked for details			1
if they 're not prepared , they 'll either mirror your language or stutter for an answer , ' he explains			2
' the greater the consequences , the more signals a liar gives off , ' adds , giving the example that a person who has committed a serious fraud would give more signals than someone who has stolen a cream cake			0
but according to the lie - sniffing expert people often have an accurate gut instinct about whether those close to them are telling the truth or not			0
' the difference is that the techniques i 've learned accelerate this process so i can have the same level of rapport and insight with another in seconds , ' he explains			0
but one of the easiest ways to spot a liar is spotting a twitch			1
liars often twitch when they are being untruthful , ' he says			2
' sometimes it can be a particularly long blink , or it could be a tiny muscle in the cheek or neck			0
men in particular have an area at the bottom of their nose that twitches when they are fibbing			0
' busted ! @entity29 was also caught fibbing by human lie detector			0

@entity6 is a former police officer and @entity8 's leading human
says statistically it 's a myth that a liar ca n't look you in the eye
also explains blink rate may *double* or triple and liars often twitch
*faster* or *slower* *breathing* and becoming less *animated* also signs
