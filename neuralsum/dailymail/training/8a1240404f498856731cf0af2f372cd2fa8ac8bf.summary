by @entity1 reporter published : 06:04 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 09:52 est , 23 november 2012 a hilarious @entity3 video clip showing four men forming a ' human bicyle ' on an airport travelator has gone viral with more than half a million hits in under a week			1
billed as ' four bored scousers at @entity10 ' , the 17 - second clip starts with a general view of a moving walkway			1
half way through , four men appear , with one on his back and using his hands as ‘ pedals ’ , one at the front as ‘ handlebars ’ , one bent over as the ‘ seat ’ and one on top as the ‘ cyclist ’			1
but the clip , which has been shared by celebrities including @entity27 comic @entity26 , may not be all as it seems			1
@entity29 - eyed viewers have noticed the footage is n't filmed in @entity31 at all - and the men involved may not even be from @entity33			2
' airport sources said the home - made movie was actually shot at @entity51 or @entity52 , although the passengers may have been booked on a flight to @entity10			2
despite doubts over the origin of the jokers , scousers left comments in their droves			0
@entity60 wrote it ' made him proud to be a @entity27 ' , while @entity62 said : ' i 'm a @entity64 from @entity65 and i 've got to say i love the @entity27 , proper salt of the earth people , great banter			0
' dubious @entity3 viewers are also sceptical the clip was filmed in @entity10 , with some suggesting @entity52 was the real location @entity71 reckons @entity33 have ' the best humour they 're the funniest people around ' , while @entity73 said the video was the ' best thing the @entity27 have produced in years '			1
the video has n't impressed everyone though , with a spokesman for @entity10 only offering the faintest of praise			0
' we can think of better ways to entertain yourself while waiting in the terminals for an aircraft			0
' they ’ve demonstrated an interesting approach to innovation , however , with their bicycle design but it ’s not something we would recommend on a moving walkway			0
perhaps a play area would be more suitable			0
