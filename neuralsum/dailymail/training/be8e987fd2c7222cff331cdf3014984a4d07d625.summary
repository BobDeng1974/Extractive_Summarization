by @entity1 reporter published : 03:48 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 24 september 2013 ever been irritated by the music your council plays when you are put on hold waiting to speak to one of its officials ? prepare to be more irritated still – you may be paying for the music through your council tax			1
some local authorities are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for the right to use pop tunes as ‘ hold music ’			1
classic : tunes by @entity19 pop group @entity18 were among most played by council phone lines to callers left on hold they have found that artists such as @entity25 , @entity26 or the @entity27 are more likely to keep callers on the line , while classical music encourages more to hang up			1
classical music is much cheaper to use as royalties do not have to be paid to long - dead composers			1
freedom of information requests to 120 town halls revealed that the bill for contemporary hold tunes runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
twelve of the authorities that use pop music spent £ 300,000 over the past three years			1
@entity41 , chief executive of the @entity42 , said : ' taxpayers will be appalled that councils are wasting their hard - earned money to pay for hold music when there are plenty of free options available			1
' people expect their cash to be spent on essential frontline services , not on this kind of frivolity			0
local authorities would do better to ensure that calls get answered rather than wondering how to entertain the residents they leave hanging on the telephone			0
' as for the wider issue of the cost of music licences , the rules need to be reviewed as it ’s deeply unfair that employers , both in the public and private sector , have to pay huge sums of money just for staff to tune into the radio			1
' high price : councils have spent tens of thousands of pounds on royalty fees for music from artists , such as @entity78 , pictured , to be played on phone lines to callers on hold @entity82 - which was one of the 120 authorities to respond to the request for information - admitted spending about £ 1,000 a year on hold music , where customers were greeted with ditties by @entity90 popstar @entity78 and swinger @entity91 ’s @entity92			1
mayor @entity93 said : ' we have only just started using more varied and up - to - date music for customers to listen to when on hold or waiting for a response on the phone			1
' this has been done to respond to feedback from customers			0
we regularly use feedback to improve the experience of our customers while ensuring a value - for - money approach			2
' most authorities either use a royalty - free track built into their telephone service or simply leave their customers waiting in silence			2
tragedy : while councils across the country face spending cuts , many still found money to spend on pop music , from bands including the @entity119 , to pipe down phone lines among them @entity122 ’s @entity121 , @entity123 by @entity124 , and various pieces by @entity126 were played down the telephone to users			1
councils in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 also used royalty - free original pieces by playing music from local children and musicians			1
councils ' favourite : @entity126 's music is chosen by the majority of local authorities as an on hold telephone tune royalty - free pieces by classical composers were also popular with councils - with @entity126 the most frequently heard artist			1
@entity126 has also been heralded as the king of council hold music , a survey found			1
the @entity153 composer 's work was favoured as a means of keeping callers on the line by the majority of 150 councils questioned , according to a @entity160 request			1
some local authorities discovered more modern easy - listening chart songs - such as @entity18 and @entity163 - dramatically reduced the number of people hanging up			2
the findings came as no surprise to @entity126 expert professor @entity168 , director of the @entity169			0
he said : ' i think the real reason is @entity126 can be listened to at so many different levels			0
he is at the top of the classical charts regularly			0
' the @entity126 phenomenon is an extraordinary thing			0
' you can have @entity126 - themed chocolate , ski holidays , tours - he seems to have a particular resonance for the troubled 21st century			2
' selections from @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity124 featured in the data , provided by around 120 of the authorities contacted under @entity160 laws by the @entity189			1
but it was mozart - and his @entity191 40 and his @entity194 pieces - which were deemed most suitable by council bosses			2
the fact that the work is out of copyright , and therefore does not command a fee , may have something to do with the selection			0
everywhere - @entity204 - @entity203 - @entity202 of @entity205 of @entity90 - @entity206 takes it all - @entity208 @entity207 n’t know why - @entity212 ’ll @entity213 - @entity214 for a star to fall - @entity211 - @entity210 but prof @entity168 there were other reasons the popular composer was hand - picked over his contemporaries			2
' @entity191 40 has got a certain passion to it , ' he said			0
' there is a lot to it and a lot of angst			0
' but it is not the whole piece that people recognise , or that it is famous for			0
it is just the introduction			0
' it is very popular with ringtones , another way younger people are able to enjoy his music			2
' chart - toppers such as the @entity27 , @entity18 and @entity163 have been credited with improving customer satisfaction levels at a local authority - after bosses decided to swap hold music for taxpayer - funded pop tunes			1
@entity244 said the number of people who hang up while on hold has more than halved since piping commercial tracks down the telephone to those in the queue			2
while most councils opt for rights - free jingles , classical music or just silence , taxpayers in @entity253 have had tracks by the likes of @entity261 , @entity210 and @entity262 unleashed upon them			1
@entity253 is one of a handful of authorities to have ditched traditional hold music in favour of easy - listening chart songs , which require royalty payments to the @entity270 ( @entity270 )			1
councillor @entity271 , executive member for highways at @entity244 , said : ' people can be kept waiting for a few minutes at peak times so we use commercial songs for our on - hold music			1
quite frankly , our callers love it			0
' it costs just £ 175 per year and since we introduced it , we have reduced our abandoned call rate by half - from 4,000 calls per month to just 1,600			1
' i would , however , like to take this opportunity to apologise for our use of the @entity27 ’s @entity288			0
i accept this was a deplorable lapse in judgement and we deserve all the criticism we get			0
' in our defence , it was either that or @entity297 ’s @entity296			0
' @entity298 pays just over £ 2,000 annually for playing all sorts of music , with its telephone system using tracks including @entity303 ’ she ’s a lady , chasing cars by @entity306 and @entity307 by @entity308			1

@entity312 , @entity313 , 1 hour ago @entity314 from @entity18 very apt for the poor fools who are paying for these monsters in power			0

letshaveitright , manchester , @entity320 , 3 hours ago it 's only taxpayers ' money , why not waste it on what we want when we want , no one can bring the council to book , they are an authoritarian regime that is beyond reach and so can spend like a gormless lottery winner on any whim that takes their fancy			2
i would like to know who gets these contracts and who at the council signs them off @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity320 , 5 hours ago should be changed to no cost now and councils fined if they dont switch			1
- ken , bristol , 23/9/2013 12:18 --- --- --- -- it 's all very well fining councils @entity351 , but who do you think would be paying the fine , that 's right , the long suffering council tax payer			2
@entity356 , @entity357 , 5 hours ago am i on the same planet here folks ? why does n't some musician compose a tune and the government buy the rights and then give it to all government departments and councils to play ? ...			0
hello ! sheila , @entity368 , @entity369 , 6 hours ago it defies description , how much more of the publics money can these fools waste ! , and their taste in music is abysmal ! @entity376 , @entity377 , 11 hours ago watch for huge increases in traffic , parking and bin fines , and relentless enforcement			0
after all , someone 's got to pay the bill for all this tomfoolery , and guess who gets the nod			0
@entity388 ... oy ... @entity389 , @entity319 , @entity320 , 11 hours ago how much us offset against premium call numbers ? changing us more by engaging in more popular music so we do n't hang up ? ? ? ? @entity393 , @entity394 , @entity320 , 13 hours ago if i got @entity18 i 'd hang up pronto ! ! - salads64 , @entity396 , 23/9/2013 12:41 --- --- --- --- --- --- - that 's what they want you to do ! @entity400 , @entity401 , @entity320 , 13 hours ago " a huge immoral scab on what should be entertainment " - @entity405 , @entity319			2
so do you think your entertainment should come for free ? if composers and musicians do n't get paid for their work they 'll simply find other jobs , and who will be the poorer then ? the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity419			0
