by @entity0 published : 21:51 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 01:29 est , 1 november 2012 on sunday , @entity1 will attempt to make history and climb 103 flights of stairs to the top of one of the world 's tallest skyscrapers using a bionic leg that he controls via his thoughts			1
@entity1 , 31 , is a software engineer , who signed up to test the trailblazing prosthetic leg after he lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident			1
he will put the groundbreaking bionic limb to the ultimate test on sunday when he attempts to climb @entity17 's @entity16			1
biomedical engineer @entity18 , left , and research prosthetist @entity19 fit an experimental ' bionic ' prosthetic leg on @entity1 at the @entity21 keep it up : @entity1 kicks a soccer ball as biomedical student @entity24 makes adjustments to the leg at the @entity21 his whirring , robotic leg will respond to electrical impulses from muscles in his hamstring			1
@entity1 will think , ‘ climb stairs , ’ and the motors , belts and chains in his leg will synchronize the movements of its ankle and knee			1
@entity1 hopes to make it to the top in an hour , longer than it would 've taken before his amputation , less time than it would take with his normal prosthetic leg - or , as he calls it , his ‘ dumb ’ leg			1
a team of researchers will be cheering him on and noting the smart leg 's performance			2
when @entity1 goes home to @entity53 , @entity54 , where he lives with his wife and two children , the experimental leg will stay behind in @entity17			1
researchers will continue to refine its steering			0
taking it to the market is still years away			0
‘ somewhere down the road , it will benefit me and i hope it will benefit a lot of other people as well , ’ @entity1 said about the research at the @entity21			1
bionic - or thought - controlled - prosthetic arms have been available for a few years , thanks to pioneering work done at the @entity21			0
with leg amputees outnumbering people who 've lost arms and hands , the @entity17 researchers are focusing more on lower limbs			1
if a bionic hand fails , a person drops a glass of water			0
if a bionic leg fails , a person falls down stairs			2
out on a limb : after losing his right leg in a motorcycle accident , mr @entity1 signed up to become a research subject , helping test a trailblazing prosthetic leg that 's controlled by his thoughts futuristic : the false limb mr @entity1 will be pushing to the limit when he makes his ascent the @entity16 climb will be the bionic leg 's first test in the public eye , said lead researcher @entity99 of the institute 's @entity100			1
the climb , called ‘ @entity102 , ’ is a fundraiser for the institute with about 2,700 people climbing			0
this is the first time the climb has played a role in the facility 's research			0
to prepare , @entity1 and the scientists have spent hours adjusting the leg 's movements			1
on one recent day , 11 electrodes placed on the skin of @entity1 's thigh fed data to the bionic leg 's microcomputer			1
the researchers turned over the ‘ steering ’ to @entity1			2
he kicked a soccer ball , walked around the room and climbed stairs , much to the researchers pleasure			2
@entity1 likes the bionic leg			1
compared to his regular prosthetic , it 's more responsive and more fluid			0
as an engineer , he enjoys learning how the leg works			2
it started with surgery in 2009			0
when @entity1 's leg was amputated , a surgeon repositioned the residual spaghetti - like nerves that normally would carry signals to the lower leg and sewed them to new spots on his hamstring			1
that would allow @entity1 one day to be able to use a bionic leg , even though the technology was years away			1
challenge : the @entity16 , where mr @entity1 will put the bionic leg through its paces the surgery is called ‘ targeted muscle reinnervation ’ and it 's like ‘ rewiring the patient , ’ @entity99 said			1
‘ and now when he just thinks about moving his ankle , his hamstring moves and we 're able to tell the prosthesis how to move appropriately			0
’ to one generation it sounds like ‘ @entity156 , ’ a 1970s tv show featuring a rebuilt hero			0
a younger generation may think of @entity161 's bionic hand			0
but @entity99 's inspiration came not from fiction , but from his fellow @entity165 @entity164 , who attempted a cross-country run on a regular artificial leg to raise money for cancer research in 1980			2
‘ i 've run marathons , and when you 're in pain , you just think about @entity164 who did it with a wooden leg and made it halfway across @entity176 before cancer returned , ’ @entity99 said			2
experts not involved in the project say the @entity17 research is on the leading edge			2
most artificial legs are passive			0
‘ they 're basically fancy wooden legs , ’ said @entity183 of the @entity184			0
others have motorized or mechanical components but do n't respond to the electrical impulses caused by thought			0
‘ this is a step beyond the @entity191 , ’ @entity183 said			0
‘ if they can achieve it , it 's very noteworthy and suggests in the next 10 years or so there will be good commercial devices out there			0
’ the $ 8 million project is funded by the @entity200 @entity199 and involves @entity201 , the @entity202 , the @entity203 and the @entity204 .			0

@entity1 lost his leg in a motorcycle accident
he will walk up 103 flights of stairs to the top of @entity16 in @entity17
