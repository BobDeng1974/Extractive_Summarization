@entity0 , sacked as assistant manager by @entity2 this week , has revealed he is suffering from the same debilitating illness as @entity5 midfielder @entity4			1
former @entity5 and @entity6 , 57 , has been fighting the chronic bowel disease ulcerative colitis since 1990 along with periodic bouts of depression			1
@entity0 has decided to reveal his medical condition in order to save his career in football management and rebut drinking allegations			1
revealing all : @entity0 revealed he is fighting the chronic bowel disease ulcerative colitis claims were made from inside @entity2 that @entity0 was the worse for wear in the dug - out for the 3 - 2 home defeat by @entity22 last wednesday — a result that led to manager @entity24 and his back - room staff ’s dismissal			1
@entity0 explained that his medical condition can give him the ‘ woozy ’ appearance of being drunk			1
‘ i need to control the ulcerative colitis with strict medication , which i had not done before the @entity22 game , ’ he said			1
‘ that is the reason i did n’t return to the dug - out after half - time as i needed to be close to a toilet			0
keeping quiet : @entity0 said he did not tell @entity24 about his illness that make him appear ' woozy ' ‘ unfortunately i can look the worse for wear but it is nothing to do with drink			1
i did have verbals with @entity41 , but it was nothing			0
‘ i was face to face with ( @entity2 ) chief executive @entity44 and the owner mr @entity46 straight before the game			0
and if i had been unable to carry out my duties , they had the right to sack me on the spot			0
i most certainly had n’t been drinking on the train before the match			2
’ a clearly agitated @entity0 was involved in a touchline row with @entity22 boss @entity41 at half - time			2
and @entity2 sources suggested that @entity0 had arrived at @entity57 not in the best condition having earlier travelled to and from @entity59 by train to watch @entity61 play @entity62			1
watching on : @entity2 owner and chairman @entity46 ( centre ) and chief executive @entity44 made changes to the managerial team last week tough time : @entity5 midfielder @entity4 also suffers from ulcerative colitis @entity0 was banned from driving for three years after a drink - driving conviction when he was found to be three times over the legal limit			1
@entity2 insiders also said that @entity24 had tolerated @entity0 not being in the best shape for work on other occasions - seen as one of the reasons for the @entity77 being sacked after just 13 @entity79 games			2
the club ’s sensitivity about the conduct of their management that night was due to @entity85 owner @entity46 being in attendance			0
and some of the players had voiced concern about whether @entity0 was well enough to carry on coaching			2
@entity0 added : ‘ i did n’t want to make a fuss about my illness , i did n’t tell @entity24			2
@entity4 said how hard it was to tell his team - mates			0
but i desperately want to carry on in football and there ’s no chance of that happening if everyone gets the wrong impression that i have a drink problem			2
‘ i was very stupid about the drink - driving and i have had trouble with depression on occasions			0
but not since i was back in football			0
i was so excited about the @entity2 challenge , but it ’s all about results			0
’ also leaving @entity2 along with head coach @entity24 , technical director @entity108 and @entity0 are first - team coaches @entity109 and @entity111 , who were brought from @entity5 by @entity24			2
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @entity112 , the @entity114 ’s @entity113 reporter , should really look at his own puerile @entity116 postings before using social media to criticise proper journalists in @entity119			0
getting it wrong : @entity114 's @entity112 made some remarks on @entity116 which he later delete @entity112 , an @entity122 heir to a family fortune , thought it appropriate to make banal fun of @entity129 ski jumper @entity127 ’s name			0
the @entity114 made no comment but the relevant @entity116 comments were deleted immediately they were made aware of them			0
lord ’s have officially invited @entity136 outcast @entity134 to play in their showcase @entity138 v @entity137 match on july 5 to mark 200 years of cricket on the ground			1
@entity134 has yet to reply , but the @entity138 ’s decision to pick him so soon after he was dumped by the national selectors is not likely to go down well with the @entity145 , also headquartered at @entity146			1
back at the home of cricket ? @entity134 has been invited to play for the @entity138 against the @entity149 at @entity146 especially as @entity137 captain @entity150 can be guaranteed to use the platform to berate @entity136 yet again for ditching @entity134 and keeping @entity153 as captain			1
the @entity155 has had a difficult time organising their venues , especially with @entity159 opting out at the last moment			0
but the corporate hospitality and international travel packages have gone off the scale in the first six weeks on the market			1
the £ 30million of business is more than the @entity166 or the @entity168 @entity167 managed in a similar period			0
selling well : corporate hospitality packages for the @entity155 have been selling well meanwhile , @entity171 being fined £ 12,000 for the illegal selling of tickets at @entity166 has not prevented the company being appointed the official corporate hospitality operators for the @entity176			1
a @entity178 2014 spokeswoman said : ‘ the unauthorised ticket selling was not in any way deliberate and compliance procedures were fully reviewed to ensure such an occurrence would not arise in future			0
