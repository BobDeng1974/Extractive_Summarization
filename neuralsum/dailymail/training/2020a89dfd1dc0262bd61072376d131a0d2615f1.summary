it sounds like the plot of a bad horror film , but doctors are gearing up to do the world ’s first head transplant			0
@entity7 surgeon @entity6 wants to take the head from someone with an incurable illness and graft it on to a healthy body			1
he claims the first operation could be done in just two years ’ time			2
people with muscle - wasting diseases and those whose organs are riddled with cancer could also have their head put on a new body			2
those with motor neurone disease , the condition suffered by @entity18 and portrayed by oscar - winner @entity37 in the film @entity38 , might also benefit			0
eventually , the technique could be used to extend the life of healthy people in the ‘ ultimate cosmetic surgery ’			0
critics have described the plans as ‘ pure fantasy ’ , but dr @entity6 claims all the necessary techniques exist and that he just needs to put them together			1
it is already more than 40 years since the first monkey head transplant and a basic operation on a mouse has just been done in @entity52			2
dr @entity6 already has a long list of potential patients , and will announce his plans at a top medical conference this summer in a bid to get the backing needed to do the first transplant in 2017			1
the location has yet to be decided , but the surgeon , from the @entity62 , says he would love to do it in @entity64			0
the new body would come from a normal transplant donor who is brain dead			2
both the donor and the patient would have their head severed from their spinal cord at the same time , using an ultra-sharp blade to give a clean cut			1
the patient ’s head would then be moved on to the donor ’s body and attached using a ‘ glue ’ called polyethylene glycol to fuse the two ends of the spinal cord together			1
the muscles and blood supply would be stitched up , before the patient is put in a coma for four weeks to stop them moving while the head and body heal together			1
if that does n’t sound bizarre enough , they would then be given small electric shocks to stimulate their spinal cord and strengthen the connections between their head and new body			2
when the patient is brought out of their medically - induced coma , they should be able to move , feel their face and even speak with the same voice , this week ’s @entity98 reports			0
powerful immunosuppressant drugs should stop the new body from being rejected and intensive psychological support would also be provided			0
dr @entity6 says he believes it would be ethically sound to carry out the procedure when people have no other hope of a cure			1
however , the ethical arguments extend past the transplant itself			0
for instance , if the patient went on to have children , they would biologically belong to the donor because the sperm or eggs would have come from the new body			1
initially , a shortage of donors means that the surgery would be limited to those with severe illness			0
but eventually , it could be used to allow healthy people to live longer			0
dr @entity6 said that if science reaches the stage when human cloning is easy , a 60 - year - old could make a copy of themselves			1
they could then put their old head on a new , healthy body made from their own dna – meaning they would keep their memories and personality			1
@entity141 , chairman of the @entity142 , said : ‘ i embrace the concept of spinal fusion and i think there are a lot of areas that a head transplant could be used but i disagree with @entity6 on the timing			2
‘ he thinks it ’s ready , i think it ’s far into the future			0
’ but @entity153 , a @entity154 doctor who has carried out one of the few operations that has allowed someone with a spinal cord injury to walk again , said : ‘ i do n’t believe it will ever happen			0

@entity7 surgeon @entity6 believes head transplants are possible
the techniques allows the patient ***'s*** head be grafted onto a healthy body
paralysed patients and those with incurable illness could benefit
however , each operation will cost an *estimated* £ 7.5million to complete
dr @entity6 said both heads would be removed at the same time
he would then glue the patient ***'s*** head onto the donor ***'s*** body
