' there is some confusion over the [ plane 's ] last point of contact , ' the letter reads			2
it has been sent to @entity21 prime minister @entity20 and @entity23 prime minister @entity22 , days before a deeper search of the southern @entity19 begins			1
demanding answers : @entity26 's ( left ) partner @entity25 ( right ) , 50 , was on board @entity2 , along with 238 other passengers and crew , when it disappeared in the early hours of march 8 on a flight from @entity30 to @entity31 a host of @entity23 ministers and government bodies involved in the so far fruitless search also received a copy of the letter , which calls for all the wrong information about what happened to their loved ones to be erased			1
it analyses the preliminary report into the plane â€™s disappearance , which was released on may 1			2
@entity26 's partner @entity25 , 50 , was on board the plane , along with 238 other passengers and crew , when it disappeared in the early hours of march 8 on a flight from @entity30 to @entity31			1
angry : family of the missing @entity2 passengers have written an 18 - page letter to the @entity54 and @entity23 demanding answers			1
a stock picture of the plane is shown in this photo recipient : @entity21 prime minister @entity20 received a copy of the letter she has spoken up for the families involved in writing the letter , who were helped by a host of experts , including retired pilots and air traffic controllers and military experts to compile their report			1
ms @entity26 , who lives in @entity31 , said the 350 family members want more answers about the investigation to be released and for transparency , the @entity75 reports			0
they have asked that raw radar data from @entity2 be released for independent analysis			1
and they have also questioned how authorities could be certain the @entity81 had crashed into the southern @entity19			1
devastated : relatives of passengers on board the missing flight , seen here in @entity31 in march , have still not received much concrete information in charge : @entity23 's prime minister @entity22 also received the letter from distraught families the @entity23 government has now pledged to publicly release the raw satellite data , from @entity95 satellite communications company , which shows how the plane 's path was located after it disappeared from civilian and military radar			1
however , they have given no indication on when this will be done			0
' we request that a comprehensive interim report be issued as soon as possible detailing all the known facts , to include , but not be limited to , the many areas that we have enumerated in our analysis			0
' we believe that eliminating wrong information and assumptions is as important as confirming correct information and assumptions , ' the letter says			0
the search for @entity2 , off @entity113 on @entity115 's west coast , has so far failed to bring results			1
searching : the @entity120 - 21 , operating from the @entity21 navy 's @entity118 vessel ( pictured ) , has been searching an area of the @entity19 where four acoustic signals were detected in early april at sea : commander @entity126 commander @entity124 ( left ) and @entity128 , @entity129 , watch the launching of the @entity131 ( @entity132 ) @entity133 off the deck of @entity118 on april 17 , 2014 it has now emerged that the underwater search for the missing @entity6 plane by the @entity120 - 21 drone will wind up in days , ahead of commercially contracted technology being used for a deeper ocean hunt			1
the @entity141 , operating from the @entity21 navy 's @entity118 vessel , has been searching an area of the @entity19 where four acoustic signals were detected in early april			2
retired defence chief @entity144 , who has previously said the sounds were man - made , on thursday said it was still too early to discount the pings amid speculation they might not be from flight mh370 's black box after all			0
' they are still being analysed , ' mr @entity144 told @entity153			0
' we are ensuring that nothing has been overlooked and that everything has been considered			0
' work also continues to review and analyse all the data and information relating to the likely flight path of @entity2 , which was largely provided by @entity162 company @entity161			2
mr @entity144 said the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) would make an announcement about that ' extensive and very robust process of review ' in the future			0
' nothing has been overlooked ' : former defence chief @entity144 , chief coordinator of the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) , said it was still too early to discount the pings that were heard in the southern @entity19 clueless : the search for @entity2 , off @entity113 on @entity115 's west coast , has so far failed to bring much evidence to light he was certain the @entity81 wound up in the @entity19 and searchers were looking in the ' right broad area '			1
@entity163 said @entity118 was expected to depart the search area on wednesday and return to the @entity21 fleet base on saturday where the @entity141 would be demobilised			0
in the meantime , it will continue operating within its depth operating limits			0
two @entity183 ships , the @entity185 and @entity184 , are on their way to the search area to map the ocean floor in preparation for the deep ocean technology , which , like the @entity141 , will use side - scan sonar to hunt for wreckage			2
mr @entity144 also said the first book about the plane , written by @entity196 writer @entity195 , was disappointing and insensitive			0
in the book , @entity195 claims the plane could have been shot down by @entity196 - @entity199 strike fighters as part of a training drill that went horribly wrong			0
' the families have gone through an incredibly traumatic time over the last two - and - a - half months , ' mr @entity144 said			0
' to be putting books out at this stage is very premature			0
' there 's still a long way to go with the search , and of course , if we eventually find the aircraft , the investigation into what actually happened			2
