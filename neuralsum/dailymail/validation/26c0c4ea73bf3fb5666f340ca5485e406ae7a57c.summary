stars of the @entity2 reality shows , @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , shared their teen pregnancy on television and had a baby , @entity9 , they placed for adoption			1
but their personal life before their reality show fame was mired in violence , drugs and sexual abuse			2
the @entity4 couple announced their engagement in december after @entity6 surprised his sweetheart with an diamond engagement ring			1
days later , @entity5 gave birth to their second child , @entity24			1
their first child , @entity9 , now five , was given up for adoption when they were 16			2

both @entity6 , 24 , and @entity5 , who turns 24 on march 12 , grew up in different trailer parks in @entity39 , @entity40 , but they both experienced the trailer park trash life of intoxicated parents deep into drug abuse , parental jail time and violence			1
but they 've never revealed the hell they experienced as children as a result or the terrifying habits their parents passed onto them			1
in their new memoir , @entity59 , the @entity4 fan - favorites , both 23 , talk about witnessing drug - related gun fights , abusing ecstasy and cocaine and more out of control			1
@entity5 and @entity6 admit they did n't give birth control much thought			1
they were using the pull - out method , and that was it			0
' i did n't wear condoms and @entity75 never went on birth control , ' writes @entity6			1
the @entity4 and her boyfriend decided to give their baby up for adoption oh so innocent : @entity5 's mother was a drunk often passed out on the floor , her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail			1
@entity6 became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking , smoking weed and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight @entity5 says her mother was ' a b * * * * ' and a drunk often passed out on the floor , her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail			1
' it was chaos all the time			2
i did n't like it , and i did n't thrive on it , but i was familiar with it			0
it was normal to me , ' @entity5 writes			1
@entity6 's father was a crack addict , a con artist , who spent most of his son 's younger years in jail while his supportive mother cycled through boyfriends			1
so the little boy became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking , smoking week and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight			0
the young couple fell in love at age twelve and ' we both ended up on the same wild ride '			2
' our decision to have sex — and the way we handled it — brought about a consequence that changed our lives forever			1
' the as - yet - unmarried childhood sweethearts had their second child , @entity129 on january 1 this year that they are raising , and decided to write about life before the cameras were rolling when they were terrified teenagers mired in the most extreme dysfunctional families in a seedy environment			2
@entity5 viewed herself as a social butterfly and opted for multiple boyfriends over passing grades in school although school helped her forget how miserable life was back at the trailer			1
@entity6 spotted her when they were both in junior high , walked up and just took her hand			1
' we just walked on ahead , holding hands , and we 've been together ever since ' , he writes			1
' her smile lights up the room and her eyes are beautiful piercing gray			1
plus , she 's got bigger t * * s than any other girl in the seventh grade			1
' definitely my kind of chick			0
i think to myself , " i have to have her			0
" he wrote her funny notes , cracked jokes , clowned around			0
he was more open than she was and he taught her to state her own opinions after years of smothering them and lying			0
' so speaking my mind and sharing my feelings just was n't at the top of my list of survival skills			0
it was n't something that had gotten positive results in the past			0
blowing smoke : @entity5 smokes on a bong at a gathering with friends in august 2012 baby joy : @entity5 gave birth to their second child , @entity24 in january , days after they got engaged ' for my whole life , i had a habit of telling people what i thought they wanted to hear , even if it was n't the truth '			1
but they did n't start sleeping together until ten months later			0
@entity6 was molested by an older girl , a friend of his older sister , when he was nine years old			1
' one day i went over to her house with my sister and some other people , and for some reason or another , everyone else left but this older girl and me			1
for the next several hours , while we were alone together in her house , it was sex act after sex act after sex act			1
it went on all day			0
she had us doing everything she could think of , one thing after another			0
there 'd be a break and then it would start up again			2
and when it was finally over , i did n't know what the hell had happened '			0
that incident left him wanting sex from girls who were only ten years old and if they did n't put out , he called them prudes and broke up with them			2
when @entity75 finally gave in to @entity6 's sexual desires , it was gangbusters – ' banging in his mom 's trailer '			1
' once we 'd done it once , we were doing it all the time ! after waiting so long we turned into crazy , horny teenagers			1
it was so bad , ' she says			0
' we would drink and party together and fool around constantly , all the time '			2
' unfortunately , we were not being safe at all ' , @entity6 says			1
' we were using the pull - out method , and that was it			0
i did n't wear condoms and @entity75 never went on birth control			0
' we just did n't feel like we had to			0
my parents had n't given me a real talk about it yet , and @entity75 's parents had n't given her a talk			2
we went through sex education and everything , but i sort of thought i was an expert already			2
we are family : ' nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman ... my sister and my mother ... family is everything ! , ' @entity6 posted on @entity253 ' we thought pulling out is good enough , and like typical dumb kids , we could n't actually comprehend what would happen if it was n't			1
' we just approached sex like we 'd taken the pills and the air duster			1
it was fun and it was available , so we did it , because the risks did n't really scare us			0
we were doing adult things with a child 's level of understanding '			2
they were also consuming big quantities of drugs			0
he was smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking booze at age eight as well as ' huffin ' air duster that he had stolen from @entity278 that make his head turn into a balloon			0
it caused him to have a seizure and pee all over himself			0
she smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill @entity287 to trip out hallucinating , consuming five or six at a time			1
she snorted @entity288 – or anything else that happened to be around			0
' and there was @entity291 ' , where we chugged a bunch of cough syrup to get high			2
we did @entity295 when we had that			0
basically , anything we could get our hands on to get high with , we 'd do it			1
' i was a little behind on the air duster			0
i watched my friends do it for about a month , but i was kind of scared of it			0
but then i got curious to see what the big deal was , so i started doing that , too			0
' we never really drank much , funny enough			0
we did everything else we could get , huffin ' , snorting pills , smoking weed , we were all about that stuff			0
but even our friends were n't really drinking			0
why drink when you can huff air duster ? ' – was her thought			0
happy reunion : @entity5 and @entity6 's reunion with their biological daughter was filled with joy , smiles and plenty of happy tears she was just trekking down the same drug route that generations of her relatives had traveled for years			1
he was in the same boat			0
' it would have been better not to mess around with air duster and snort cocaine in middle school			0
no doubt about that ' , she says			0
' and we can never be certain how long that phase would have lasted , if it was n't for one little thing			0
once that pregnancy test came back positive , there was no more room for drugs and alcohol in our lives			1
' we dropped that stuff and did n't even have time to look back			2
' the teen pregnancy saved their lives from falling further into drug abuse			2
now the couple are pursuing healthy , positive lives and hope to encourage teenagers in trouble with self - esteem issues or in unhealthy relationships to seek out counseling to learn self - worth			2
' i put my life out there to help others ' , @entity5 writes			1
' for the kids growing up in trailer parks , unstable homes or in the shadow of family problems and addiction – ' @entity373 moms			2
' pregnant teens feeling lost and scared			0
' anyone trapped in a cycle of dysfunction and wants to make something better of their lives — whatever encouragement we can offer , we offer it from the bottom of our hearts '			2
