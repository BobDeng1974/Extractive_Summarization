by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 02:13 est , 9 august 2013 the @entity1 suppressed an independent review of its executive pay which found its top brass were paid up to three times more than their public sector counterparts			1
despite being warned four years ago that the pay of the director general and his lieutenants far outstripped what they might earn in equivalent jobs in the civil service , corporation bosses failed to take immediate action to curb top - level pay			1
a study by accountants @entity17 ( @entity17 ) for the @entity18 in 2009 found their basic salaries were instead on a par with the chiefs of aggressively profit - making @entity23 companies , despite the fact they are paid with licence fee payers ’ money			1
no action : despite warnings , @entity30 bosses failed to take action to curb top salaries instead of risking embarrassment by publishing it in full , @entity1 bosses kept the report under wraps until it was released under freedom of information laws			0
last night , mps condemned the @entity1 for failing to publish the explosive findings earlier and said it illustrated a ‘ fill your boots at public expense ’ culture at the top of the corporation			2
laying bare the true extent of @entity1 largesse , the newly released documents reveal : last night conservative mp @entity51 , who sits on the influential public accounts committee of mps , said executives would be asked to explain why the report was suppressed at its next hearing in september			0
the @entity17 report was commissioned by former @entity18 chairman sir @entity58 in april 2009 in response to widespread dismay at senior staff bonuses that year			0
instead of publishing the report , the @entity1 ’s executive remuneration committee – including mr @entity63 – discussed its findings in private and never published it in full			1
review : the @entity17 report was commissioned by former @entity18 chairman sir @entity58 in april 2009 at a meeting in july 2009 , the committee decided @entity1 pay should be aligned with executives in the commercial public sector meaning the @entity1 could justify paying its executives far higher salaries			1
yesterday a @entity1 spokesman justified the decision to benchmark its pay against the commercial public sector by saying the corporation needed to compete for talent with commercial media rivals			1
but @entity83 mp @entity82 , who also sits on the public accounts committee , said : ‘ there seems to have been a culture under the previous director general of “ fill your boots at public expense and the expense of the licence fee payer ”			0
the gravy train has finally hit the buffers			0
those responsible must be held fully accountable for it			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ a great deal has been done since 2009 to address issues around executive remuneration at the @entity1			2
‘ following this review , the senior management paybill has been reduced by more than 30 per cent , the director general ’s salary has come down almost 33 per cent , while the ratio of director - general ’s salary to median pay has fallen from 16.8 to 11 and bonuses have been permanently withdrawn from executive directors			2

the @entity18 commissioned a study of basic salaries back in 2009
bosses salaries found to be on a par with those at top @entity23 companies
but the @entity1 kept the report under wraps until an @entity122 *request* was made
@entity124 have condemned the @entity1 for not publishing findings earlier
the @entity1 ’s executive remuneration committee was warned former director general @entity63 ’s ***£*** *651,000* basic salary was more than three times what he would be able to earn in an equivalent role in the civil service , @entity133 or judiciary .
the corporation ’s top ten earners , including former deputy director general @entity138 on ***£*** *609,000* and former chief operating *officer* @entity139 on ***£*** *430,000* , were paid on average more than twice their public sector counterparts . on average , basic salaries were only 4 per cent lower than the private sector .
the @entity1 ’s executive remuneration committee decided to use high - paying ‘ commercial public sector ’ *institutions* – such as @entity146 or the @entity147 – as a benchmark for pay rather than more *frugal* ‘ core ’ public sector *examples* , such as the civil service . minutes show they realised the decision was ‘ likely to be *contentious* ’ .
*similar* reviews have been carried out every year since 2009 . they show executive salaries still exceed the agreed benchmark , but the @entity1 has *redacted* the documents to prevent the public from *knowing* by how much .
