babies born by caesarean section may be more likely to develop autism , research shows			1
@entity4 found the procedure appeared to increase the chances by a quarter – although there is no clear explanation			2
but academics urge women not be alarmed by the findings as the overall risk of autism remains very small in @entity15 , up to 1 in 4 deliveries now take place by c - section and rates have risen four-fold since the 1970s			1
risk : @entity4 found c - sections appeared to increase the chances of a child developing autism by a quarter the increase is partly because women who are deemed at risk of having a complicated birth are strongly advised to have the procedure because it is safer			1
but researchers from @entity30 , in @entity31 , looked at a number of existing studies linking caesareans to autism			2
they found that on average it increased the risk by 23 per cent , although there was no obvious reason behind it , the study also tried to look at whether there was a link between c - section and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( @entity47 ) , although the findings were inconclusive			1
professor @entity49 , one of the authors and a practising obstetrician , said the link between c - sections and children developing autism remains unclear			1
‘ parents should be reassured that the overall risk of a child developing @entity60 is very small and that when medically indicated it can be lifesaving , ’ she said			0
rise : c - section procedures have increased four-fold since the 1970s in the @entity15 but @entity62 , lead author of the report , said more research was needed about the possible link , given the numbers of women having @entity34			1
‘ given the accelerating rate of caesarean section globally , this finding warrants further research of a more robust quality using larger populations to adjust for important potential confounders and explore potential causal mechanisms , ’ she added			0
previously , experts have said the link could in fact be down to genes which mean babies are more likely to be born with difficult deliveries – and then develop autism			1
another possible explanation is that women who have c - sections tend to be older – and their babies are also at higher risk of the condition			1
they have urged women not to feel guilty that by having a c - section they were in any way harming their child ’s development			0
the increased rate of @entity34 is mainly down to doctors advising women to have them if they are at high risk of complications			2
these include women who are overweight , are diabetic , have previously had complications in childbirth or who have certain mental health conditions			0
but some experts have accused doctors of being too willing to carry out the procedure			2
women who do n’t want to give birth naturally can also choose to have it done privately – some have been accused of being too posh to push			0
in addition to these planned or elective @entity34 , other women will also have the operation in an emergency if they develop complications during labour			0
the study looked at both types of procedure			0
although it is far safer compared to 50 years ago there is still a risk of infection , blood clot and damage to some internal organs			0
and in 2012 a study by @entity127 found that one in 10 developed an infection and needed to stay longer in hospital a planned @entity34 costs the @entity131 an average of £ 2,369 , while a natural birth costs £ 1,665 .			0

@entity15 has seen huge rise in c - sections which now account for 1 in 4 births
doctors encourage procedure when there is a *possibility* of complications
expert warns further research is needed to explain the link with autism
