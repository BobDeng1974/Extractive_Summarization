@entity0 can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries , a federal board ruled on friday in a groundbreaking decision that recognizes the procedures are medically necessary for people who do n't identify with their biological sex			1
ruling in favor of a 74 - year - old transgender @entity13 veteran whose request to have @entity0 pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago , the agency 's @entity8 said there was no justification for a three - decade - old @entity19 rule excluding such surgeries from procedures covered by the national health program for the elderly and disabled			1
' sometimes i am asked are n't i too old to have surgery			2
my answer is how old is too old ? ' the veteran , @entity27 , of @entity28 , @entity29 , said in an email interview before the board issued its decision			1
@entity0 's @entity33 and services review board ruled friday , may 30 , in favor of @entity27 , a 74 - year - old @entity13 veteran , whose request to have @entity0 pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago @entity27 , right , holds a banner before taking part in the @entity39 to @entity40 in @entity28 ' when people ask if i am too old , it feels like they are implying that it 's a ` waste of money ' to operate at my age			1
but i could have an active life ahead of me for another 20 years			0
and i want to spend those years in congruence and not distress			0
' @entity49 , a lawyer who directs the @entity50 in @entity51 , said the ruling does not mean @entity0 recipients are necessarily entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for by the government			1
instead , the lifting of the coverage ban means they now will be able to seek authorization by submitting documentation from a doctor and mental health professionals stating that surgery is recommended in their individual case , @entity56 said			2
no statistics exist on how many people might be affected by the decision			0
@entity70 , a demographer with the @entity71 , a think tank on @entity73 issues based at the @entity74 , @entity75 , has estimated that people who self - identify as transgender make up 0.3 percent of the @entity79 adult population			0
over 49 million @entity79 are enrolled in @entity0			2
the cost of gender reassignment surgery varies , but typically ranges from $ 7,000 to $ 50,000 , according to the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84			0
in friday 's ruling , the appeals board said that @entity19 lacked sufficient evidence in 1981 when it made a ' national coverage determination ' holding that @entity0 recipients were ineligible for what it then called ' transsexual surgery ' because the procedure was too controversial , experimental , and medically risky			2
@entity27 , second from left , takes part in the @entity39 to @entity40 in @entity28 on thursday the decision recognizes sex reassignment surgeries as a medically necessary and effective treatment for individuals who do not identify with their biological sex such as @entity27 the panel went on to say that regardless of what the record showed then , studies and experts have since shown the efficacy of surgical interventions as a treatment for gender dysphoria , the diagnosis given to people who experience extreme distress due to the disconnect between their birth sex and their gender identity			1
' we have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence , which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the @entity120 , outweighs the @entity120 record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental			0
thus , as we discuss below , the grounds for the ... exclusion of coverage are not reasonable , ' the civilian panel said			0
the appeals board 's decisions are binding on @entity19 unless they are appealed in federal court			0
the @entity130 , the agency within @entity19 that manages @entity0 , opted not to defend the transgender surgery exclusion before the five - member board and had initiated the process for lifting it on its own before @entity27 filed her complaint			1
the ruling does not apply to @entity138 , which provides health coverage for individuals and families with low - incomes and is regulated by the states			0
some states have exclusions on sex reassignment surgeries and the sex hormones transgender people often take during their transitions , while others evaluate claims on a case - by - case basis			1
transgender health advocates said that because private insurance companies and medicaid programs often take their cues from the federal government on what is considered medically necessary , elective or experimental , the decision could pave the way for sex - reassignment surgeries to be a routinely covered benefit			1
@entity27 was born a man and identifies as a woman			0
' when i learned that @entity0 denies the essential care i need , i remember saying ` this is not right			0
they 're relying on these archaic reasons to deny me the care my doctor agrees i need ? i knew i had to do something to challenge that , ' @entity27 said			2
