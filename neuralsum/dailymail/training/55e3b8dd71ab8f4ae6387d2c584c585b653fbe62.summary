@entity0 has been stripped of its power to return asylum seekers to @entity3 - after a ruling by @entity6 judges			1
the decision by the @entity9 court risks plunging the entire @entity6 asylum system into chaos - and leaving border controls in this country hamstrung			0
an immigration watchdog warned the ruling would open a ‘ perfect back door into @entity0 ’			0
ruling : @entity0 and @entity17 were today told they can not send asylum seekers back to @entity3 because of the country ¿ s inadequate asylum arrangements under @entity24 rules @entity0 officials can return asylum seekers to the first @entity6 country they set foot in			1
but today the @entity28 said no - one should be returned to a country if it did not uphold their ‘ fundamental rights ’			0
this means @entity0 can not send asylum seekers back to @entity3 because its asylum system is such a mess			1
the ruling also opens the door for claims against other countries on the grounds their asylum systems are not up to scratch			0
sir @entity41 , chairman of @entity42 said : ‘ this makes @entity3 the perfect back door into @entity0			0
‘ in future , asylum seekers who are not , in fact , genuine will claim that they have come through @entity3 , whether or not they have			1
‘ it also undermines the agreement which provides for asylum seekers to be sent back to the first @entity24 country in which they arrived			1
’ around 90 per cent of illegal immigrants who arrive in @entity53 do so through @entity3 , placing enormous strain on the country ’s immigration system			1
the @entity28 in @entity9 ( pictured ) ruled that no @entity24 government can take it for granted that another member state ¿ s asylum procedures complied with fundamental rights the court ruled on a case brought by an @entity64 national known as ‘ ns ’ who was arrested in @entity3 in 2008 then expelled to @entity67			1
he escaped and travelled to the @entity0 where he applied for asylum			0
@entity0 ordered his return to @entity3 but he launched a legal challenge			2
the court ’s ruling said no @entity24 government could take it for granted that another member state ’s asylum procedures complied with fundamental rights			1
the judges said : ‘ an asylum seeker may not be transferred to a member state where he risks being subjected to inhuman treatment			2
’ as a result member states can not send an asylum seeker back if they have ‘ substantial grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment			0
’ between 2006 and 2010 , the @entity0 removed 6,034 people to other member states under the asylum rules - known as the @entity91			2
conservative mep @entity92 said it was time to ‘ get tough ’ with @entity3			0
‘ of course , it is not right that genuine asylum - seekers are returned to a country where they face further persecution ’ he said			0
‘ however , there is also now a clear incentive for people with other motives to enter the @entity24 via @entity3 , safe in the knowledge that other countries are powerless to return them			2
’ but @entity106 , chief executive of the @entity107 welcomed the ruling			0
she said : ‘ the responsibility to receive and determine claims of people seeking safety in @entity53 should be shared across the continent , particularly in @entity6 countries who see far fewer asylum seekers annually			1
‘ the focus for the member states must now be on improving asylum systems across @entity53 to ensure people are treated humanely while seeking safety in any country			2
’ immigration minister @entity123 said : ‘ asylum claims should be dealt with in the first country of arrival			0
‘ we expect every member state to ensure that the @entity129 can operate effectively across the @entity24 , and we are working with @entity3 to improve their asylum processes			1

@entity28 rules no @entity24 country can assume it can return asylum seekers to another member state
decision *forbids* @entity0 from returning @entity64 man to @entity3 , even though he came to @entity0 via that country
90 *%* of immigrants who arrive in @entity53 illegally do so through @entity3
