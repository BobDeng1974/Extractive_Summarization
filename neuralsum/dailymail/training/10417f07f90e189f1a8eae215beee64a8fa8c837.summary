last year it was revealed that the now defunct @entity162 was dealing with a backlog of 320,000 cases , which was expected to take more than 20 years to clear			0
former chief @entity167 blamed the problem on an influx of illegal immigrants who arrived in the @entity2 between 2000 and 2003 , many of whom have since changed their names and become untraceable			2
the agency has now been split into two sections , one to deal with immigration visas and one to deal with immigration law enforcement , which operates as @entity122			2
there has also been growing tensions within the coalition over immigration and border control			0
last year the @entity181 accused the @entity182 by accusing them of holding back anti-immigration measures , and the @entity182 accusing the @entity33 of dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration			2
@entity182 leader @entity188 had objected to a pilot scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants to ‘ go home or face arrest ’			0
his party also tried to scale back plans for immigration bonds – £ 3,000 payments on top of visas issued to visitors from high - risk countries , repayable only upon leaving @entity2 .			0

@entity9 had *previously* served almost five years in prison
