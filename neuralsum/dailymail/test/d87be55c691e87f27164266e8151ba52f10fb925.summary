he said : ' how this continued for six years when the @entity30 appeared to know about it , it kind of boggles my mind			1
this is about as simple and easy as you can get , and it took them this long to do anything about it			0
' @entity49 , author of @entity50 on @entity24 and @entity51 , meanwhile , asked : ' why would regulators let @entity10 operate in the markets and engage in similar trading strategies as in the @entity25 eight more times ? ' @entity10 allegedly triggered – from his home computer in @entity57 , @entity58 – the @entity24 ' @entity25 ' of may 2010 , in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices , using a series of fake transactions			1
trader @entity10 , 36 , is shown here at @entity63 after being arrested over illicit trading a flash crash is a sudden plunge in stock prices			1
on may 6 , 2010 , the @entity1 stock market dramatically collapsed – wiping billions off the world 's biggest companies			2
between 2.42pm and 2.47pm , the @entity71 shed 600 points , having already been down more than 300 points – a startling 6 per cent fall in just five minutes			0
very soon it had recorded an almost 1,000 - point loss on the day			2

' there 's a lot going on			0
' the agency , which oversees self - regulatory bodies such as the @entity30 , brought civil charges against @entity10 alongside criminal charges by the @entity127			1
the many years it took for the @entity112 to come out with its findings , and the fact that manipulation was n't mentioned in the 2010 report , suggested that the help of a whistleblower was essential in bringing the charges , one lawyer said			1
' this ca n't have been a five - year continuous investigation , ca n't have been , ' said the lawyer , who is familiar with the @entity112 's thinking , and who asked to remain anonymous			2
' something happened some period later where this came up again			0
' if there was any indication that there was manipulation behind this , given the profile of this , the agency would have proceeded			0
it would n't have taken five years			0
' @entity154 's extradition unit arrested @entity10 on tuesday night at the request of the @entity156 , which claims he set up an offshore company in the @entity158 called ' @entity159 ' and arrogantly told financial officials to ' kiss my a * * * '			2
