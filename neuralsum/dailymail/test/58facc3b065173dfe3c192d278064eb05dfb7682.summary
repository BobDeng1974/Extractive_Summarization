@entity1 star @entity0 believes the pain of @entity5 's @entity4 exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season 's @entity10 play - offs			1
@entity0 and company were left to reflect on what might have been at @entity15 's @entity14 as six @entity17 penalties gave three - time @entity20 champions @entity18 a tense 18 - 15 quarter - final success			1
@entity5 dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly - half @entity25 and captain @entity27 , but hopes of reaching a first top - flight @entity20 semi-final since 2006 floundered on their indiscipline			1
@entity0 carries during an impressive @entity5 performance , but the @entity34 side came up short attention will now quickly return to the @entity10 , with @entity5 having four games left - against @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 - in the quest for a top - four finish			1
' the overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed , ' said @entity5 full - back @entity0 , whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched @entity18 defence			1
' to have battled out of the group as we did ( @entity5 lost their first two games ) and then obviously to get into the quarter - final , to get so close and then fail at the end , it is obviously massively disappointing			1
' but we have to try to take the positives , and i think a disappointment like this is going to help us in the @entity10			2
' @entity5 stayed true to the ball - in - hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season 's @entity10 campaign , and at times , @entity18 struggled to cope			1
@entity17 was perfect from the tee to hand @entity18 the victory in a game where they were second best in @entity17 , though , they had a relentless marksman , whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent @entity18 marching on and @entity5 left to focus solely on domestic matters			1
' to put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like @entity18 is just going to add more confidence , ' @entity0 added			1
' i think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of , and i have really enjoyed playing for this club			0
' i think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome			0
i think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , paid tribute to his @entity5 and @entity1 team - mate @entity25 , who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up @entity27 for a second - half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard			1
it was a huge disappointment for @entity5 , but @entity0 hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign ' i can not speak highly enough of him ( @entity98 ) , to be honest , ' @entity0 said			1
' he is probably the best ball player i 've played with , albeit in a short space of time of two or three years			2
' he has got a very mature head on young shoulders , and it 's a real privilege to play outside him			0
' @entity5 head coach @entity103 could not mask his disappointment with the result , believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving @entity17 scoring chances			1
' there is a lot of disappointment , ' @entity25 said			0
' the first - half performance , especially , we are a lot better than that			0
' that last 10 - 15 minutes , i was pretty convinced we were going to win the game , but it 's small margins			2
@entity25 scored one try and created anotehr in a superb performance , but it was n't enough ' at half - time , we talked about composure			0
' we had n't been able to build any pressure with ball in hand , and there was also the discipline side of things			0
@entity17 was pretty dead - eye , which cost us			0
' we put it together second - half , and i think this will make us stronger			0
we will look back at the end of the season at this game , particularly , and say this is where @entity5 became very strong			2
' i thought @entity0 was on fire at full - back , and @entity25 made two good breaks for our tries			2
it was in our control , we thought			0
even at 15 - 5 down , we were confident we could win the game			2
' and @entity5 skipper @entity27 said : ' when you get to this stage of the competition , it is about winning			2
' the disappointment is two-fold			0
one is obviously losing the game and the other is probably the individual mistakes we made , particularly in the first half			0

@entity5 dominated @entity4 quarter final against @entity18
but @entity34 side came up just short 18 - 15 , despite scoring two tries
with four @entity10 games left , @entity0 wants pain to spur team on
