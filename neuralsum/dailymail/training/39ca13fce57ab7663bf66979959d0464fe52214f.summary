the bombing mission targeting a @entity2 munitions factory had been a success , but @entity6 pilot @entity5 's attempts to get home safely seemed doomed to failure			1
his b - 17f bomber had been attacked by no fewer than 15 planes - leaving one of his crew dead and six wounded ; 2nd lt @entity5 himself had been knocked out and regained consciousness just in time to right his plane after it went into a dangerous nose dive			1
but as he tried to return from the raid on @entity19 to the safety of @entity22 territory after the mission on december 20 , 1943 , the danger was not over			2
@entity5 soon had another major concern : a @entity2 plane was flying directly next to his own - so close that the pilot was looking him directly in the eyes and making big gestures with his hands that only scared @entity5 more			2
the @entity48 details @entity5 's ensuing 40 - year struggle to come to terms with why that @entity2 pilot decided to go against orders and spare the @entity34 - allowing him to fly and land his battered plane safely and go on to live a happy and full life following the war			1
the pilot in question was @entity35 , a 26 - year - old ace who had 22 victories to his name - needing just one more to be awarded the @entity61			2
but on that day , as his @entity62 closed in on the @entity34 plane he sensed something was wrong - the enemy plane was not engaging with him ; in fact , unbeknown even to @entity5 , the plane had lost it 's tail - gun compartment and one wing was badly damaged			1
as @entity35 drew closer he saw the gunner covered in blood , and how part of the plane 's outside had been ripped off			1
and he saw the wounded , terrified @entity34 airmen inside , trying to help one another tend to their injuries			0
it was then he remembered the words of his commanding officer lt @entity79			1
' honour is everything here , ' he had told a young @entity83 before his first mission			0
' special brothers ' : @entity5 ( left ) found @entity35 ( right ) more than 40 years after the war after taking out a newspaper advert the crew of the @entity89 - nicknamed @entity43 - that took off on a cold , overcast winter day in @entity91 to target an @entity92 at @entity19 , @entity2			1
that mission on december 20 , 1943 , was 2nd lt. @entity95 's first combat mission as an aircraft commander with the @entity97			2
@entity98 ( l - r ) s / sgt @entity101 - engineer / @entity99 ; sgt @entity102 ; sgt @entity103 ; sgt @entity105 ; s / sgt @entity106 - @entity107 ; sgt @entity108 turret2nd lt @entity95 - pilot ; 2nd @entity110 ; 2nd lt @entity111 ; 2nd lt @entity114 - @entity113 the senior airman added : ' if i ever see or hear of you shooting at a man in a parachute , i will shoot you down myself			0
' you follow the rules of war for you - not for your enemy			0
you fight by rules to keep your humanity			0
' his moral compass was more powerful than his need for glory			0
' for me it would have been the same as shooting at a parachute , i just could n't do it , ' @entity35 later said			2
he ended up escorting them for several miles out over the @entity134			0
but he feared that if he was seen flying so close to the enemy without engaging , he could be accused - and doubtless found guilty - of treason			0
and when he saw a @entity2 gun turret looming into view he realised he had to make a decision			0
meanwhile , the @entity34 crew had begun to train a gun on him			0
@entity35 made his decision , he saluted his counterpart , motioned for him to fly away from @entity2 territory and pulled away			1
flying aces : a specially - commissioned painting to mark the moment @entity35 's humanity and compassion allowed @entity5 to steer his plane to safety honoring past moves : @entity5 and @entity35 met with then - @entity154 governor @entity153 in 2001 the bombers began their 10 - minute bomb run at 27,300ft under heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns			1
even before they had dropped their payload @entity5 's @entity159 took hits that shattered the @entity162 nose , knocked out the number two engine , damaged number four , and caused damage to the controls			1
these initial hits forced @entity5 to drop out of formation with his fellow bombers almost immediately , the solitary , struggling @entity159 came under a series of attacks from 12 to 15 @entity2 bf - 109s and @entity174			1
in the ten - minute assault the number three engine was hit and oxygen , hydraulic , and electrical systems were damaged			0
by tthe end of it , the planes controls were only partially responsive			0
the bomber 's 11 defensive guns were reduced by the extreme cold to only the two top turret guns and one forward - firing nose gun			2
the tail gunner was killed and all but one of the crew in the rear incapacitated by wounds or exposure to the frigid air			0
lieutenant @entity5 took a bullet fragment in his right shoulder			2
this was the state @entity35 found the plane in , prompting his remarkable act of mercy			2
the stricken @entity159 did make it across 250 miles of the @entity134 and landed at @entity203 in @entity204			0
as soon as he landed , @entity5 told his commanding officer about the spotting of the @entity2 soldier , but he was instructed not to tell anyone else for fear of spreading positive stories of the @entity2 enemy			1
in 1987 , more than 40 years after the incident , @entity5 - who was still traumatised by the events of that fateful day - began searching for the man who saved his life even though he had no idea whether his savior was alive , let alone where the man in question was living			0
@entity5 bought an ad in a newsletter catering to fighter pilots , saying only that he was searching for the man ' who saved my life on dec. 20 , 1943			0
' @entity35 saw the ad in his new hometown of @entity227 , @entity228 - where he had moved after the war , unable ever to feel at home in @entity2 - and the two men got in touch			1
' it was like meeting a family member , like a brother you have n't seen for 40 years , ' @entity5 said at the pair 's first meeting			1
@entity35 revealed how he had been trying to escort them to safety and had pulled away when he feared he had come under fire			1
he told @entity5 that his hand gestures where an attempt to tell him to fly to @entity245			1
their story , told in the book @entity249 , ended in 2008 when the two men died within six months of one another , @entity35 at age 92 and @entity5 87			1
in their obituaries , each was mentioned as the other 's ' special brother '			0
a @entity159 similar to the one flown by @entity256 in his bombing mission over @entity2			0

@entity5 's @entity89 bomber had come under fire from 15 enemy planes during successful mission
@entity35 pursued it , but when he saw the damage he let it fly home to safety , guided by the moral code laid down by his commanding officer
