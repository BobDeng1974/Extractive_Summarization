an 1892 painting by @entity1 of two @entity3 girls has sold for almost £ 200million - the largest amount ever paid for a single work of art. @entity7 is understood to have bought @entity8 from the @entity11 @entity10 to be hung in its state - run museums			1
but the oil - rich country is yet to confirm the purchase , reported in the @entity16			1
@entity1 's 1892 painting @entity8 ( when will you marry ? ) has sold to @entity7 for almost £ 200million , it has been reported @entity20 , a retired @entity21 's executive who lives in @entity22 , @entity11 , where the painting has been kept in a museum for the lastfew decades , refused to be drawn on to who or for how much the painting had been sold			1
but , if the reported value is true , it will mean @entity7 has broken its own world record			2
in 2011 , it spent £ 160million on @entity32 's @entity31 , after winning a bidding war			1
at the time , it was the most ever spent on a single artwork , beating the previous record of £ 89million ( worth £ 99million today ) handed over for @entity38 ’s painting , no 5 , 1948 , which sold during a boom in the art market in 2006			1
the @entity32 has remained out of view since it was bought , however			2
the oil - rich @entity45 state previously spent £ 160million on @entity32 's @entity31 ( pictured ) , which was the world 's most expensive until its latest purchase the @entity1 sold this week , which depicts two young women in a landscape of vivid colours , has been interpreted to represent the conflict between the two realms of @entity55 convention and @entity57 custom			1
oil - rich @entity7 has acquired many @entity59 works of art in recent years , including modern pieces by @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity64 , chief executive of @entity66 - based consultancy organisation , the @entity65 , said : ‘ it is an amazing picture but this seems a huge amount of money			0
but in the impressionist market a few “ megapictures ” will always fetch over $ 100million ( £ 65million )			0
’ mr @entity64 added that such art works sell to a select group of as few as 20 people , who compete around the world to buy the most expensive pieces			2
the buyer of the @entity1 was identified as @entity79 by two art dealers in the @entity81			0
the emirate ’s museum has spent more than $ 1billion ( £ 650million ) on prestigious works			2
mr @entity64 said : ‘ we ’re seeing a huge amount of build - up of private wealth , and we ’re seeing those people allocate funds disproportionately to art collections			0
people think if they buy the best you ’ll never lose money			0
it has become the ultimate status symbol to be surrounded by $ 500million or $ 1billion worth of art which no one else can have			0
’ @entity99 , an art historian , said : ‘ this is an iconic @entity1 ; it ’s beautiful			0
he is certainly among the most sought - after painters in the world			0
’ @entity7 's museums are headed by @entity105 , pictured , the sister of the @entity106 its acquisition is a coup for @entity7 : the country , which is preparing to host the football @entity112 in 2022 , has developed a reputation for buying expensive art work over the last few years			1
its museum service is headed by @entity105 bint @entity117 , the @entity120 - educated sister of the emir of @entity7			2
she is understood to be keen to expand her country 's artistic portfolio , revealing in an interview last year with the @entity79 : ' what always remains from the greatest civilisations and histories is their buildings and artefacts			0
