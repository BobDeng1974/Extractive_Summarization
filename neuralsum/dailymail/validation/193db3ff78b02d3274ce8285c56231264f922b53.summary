perched out of a helicopter with his camera in hand , @entity1 - based photographer @entity0 has captured spectacular views of giant cruise ships from above			1
@entity0 's @entity7 series gives a bird 's - eye view of the huge floating holiday vessels			1
the @entity1 - based photographer uses high - resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door			1

mr @entity0 said : ' giant cruise ships , over three football fields long , have become unique floating cities			1
photographed symmetrically from directly above in very high resolution , the large gallery prints , up to 74 inches , show the viewer a detailed view not commonly seen			2
' the ships can be seen with their passengers lounging on deck chairs , playing on water park slides , putting greens , running tracks , and basketball courts			2
they have a curious beauty and tell us something about how we as a culture form instant communities for shared recreation and relaxation			0
the @entity17 cruise ship is radiant in the sea with a nice clash of lighting , while right , @entity72 can cater for 2,754 people and is an awesome sight at night @entity17 looks somewhat different when viewed from land , showing its height and the navy and red livery , and right , @entity72 is an imposing sight the @entity80 has a giant poolside movie theatre that will impress , while right , @entity72 has fine dining throughout the modern @entity80 ship offers all the comforts of home and more , with space for 3,082 guests and all of the signature features ' the ships which continue to be built larger and larger are fascinating to ponder as engineering marvels			1
seen as a typology , they share a common symmetry derived from function , yet juxtapose design elements both decorative and functional that set them apart			0
' this ongoing series which began in 2013 , is related to the aircraft series which i have been shooting for over 15 years			0
i take most of these photos using an 80 mpxl digital medium format camera with a gyro stabilizer , shooting from a helicopter with the door off			0
' the large highly detailed gallery prints will be on exhibit at @entity108 in @entity109 , from july 9 until august 22			0
