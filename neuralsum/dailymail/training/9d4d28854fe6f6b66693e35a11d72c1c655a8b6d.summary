a 63 - year - old grandmother has told how going to give blood at her local healthcentre saved her life			1
@entity4 , who lives in the @entity5 , was diagnosed with bowel cancer after discovering that she was anaemic when she went to donate blood			1
ms @entity4 had no other symptoms and strongly believes that the routine trip saved her life			2
@entity4 ( centre , at the 2010 @entity11 ) was diagnosed with bowel cancer after she went to give blood			1
while donating blood she learned that she was anaemic and was referred to her gp she told @entity15 : ‘ giving blood turned out to be like an @entity17			1
if i had n’t gone i might not be here now			0
i am so thankful i went			0
’ she added : ' i feel so lucky that giving blood was something that i did regularly			2
' i think it would have been quite a while before it was picked up otherwise as i did n't get have any symptoms that would have sent me to the doctor			0
' ms @entity4 went to give her 57th blood donation in august 2007 and was told that she was not eligible as her blood iron levels were too low			1
she said that initially she was not concerned about her health when nurses told her she was anaemic because she had suffered several episodes in the past			2
ms @entity4 ( pictured with her granddaughter , @entity30 ) underwent surgery and chemotherapy at @entity33			1
she believes that giving blood saved her life as she had no symptoms of the cancer however , the nurses told her that her iron levels were sufficiently low that she should see her gp			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ i went to give blood – i was a regular donor and was going to give my 57th pint			1
‘ i had the pinprick test and it showed up a problem			0
they sent it away for further tests , but i was not allowed to give blood that day , so i was a bit miffed			0
i had never been turned away before			0
’ her doctor carried out extensive tests and within two months she had been diagnosed with bowel cancer			1
she said : ' when i saw the consultant it was quite a shock			0
my first concern was how i would tell my children			0
ms @entity4 ( front left at a school reunion ) was given the all clear after her treatment for bowel cancer but four years later , a routine scan revealed a tumour on her kidney and she had to have further surgery ' it was all a bit surreal			1
' bowel cancer can cause anaemia because it can result in bleeding into the bowel which depletes the body ’s supply of red blood cells			1
other symptoms of bowel cancer include blood in the stools , abdominal pain , a change in bowel habits , and unexplained weight loss			1
ms @entity4 underwent surgery and chemotherapy at @entity33			1
following the six months treatment she was told that there were no longer any signs of the cancer in her bowel			1
just as ms @entity4 began chemotherapy , her son , 29 - year - old @entity88 ( pictured with his daughter , @entity89 ) , a @entity90 , was sent on his second six - month tour of duty in @entity92 however , ms @entity4 says that it was a hard time as just as she began chemotherapy her son , 29 - year - old @entity88 , a @entity90 , was sent on his second six - month tour of duty in @entity92			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ it was a very hard time for the family , but thankfully he returned home safely			2
‘ i did not realise how debilitated i had felt until after i had finished the chemo			0
’ in 2009 , just as ms @entity4 thought that everything was returning to normal , her daughter @entity99 , 40 , collapsed			2
ms @entity99 , who also lives in the @entity5 , collapsed after finishing a workout and found that she was unable to speak			0
she was rushed to hospital whether she underwent four months of treatment and rehabilitation			0
between ms @entity4 's cancer diagnoses , her daughter @entity99 ( pictured with her children , @entity30 and @entity107 ) collapsed and was diagnosed with @entity108 she now has no feeling in the right side of her body after months of tests , the mother of two young children was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis – a disease which affects the nerves in the brain and spine			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ @entity120 comes on gradually so people initially thought that she was just very stressed			2
‘ she had to learn to speak again and it was very strange because at first she had a @entity125 accent			0
‘ she still has no feeling in her right hand side but she can get about using a mobility scooter			0
’ however , this was still not the end of the family ’s difficulties			0
four years after her initial cancer diagnosis , a routine scan picked up a tumour in ms @entity4 ’s kidney			1
ms @entity4 told @entity15 : ' it 's all a bit surreal			1
until you talk about it you do n't realise what has happened in such a short amount of time			0
' image shows her daughter , @entity99 ms @entity4 said : ‘ it was another primary tumour so it was a bit like lightening striking twice in the same place			1
’ this time the tumour was contained within her kidney , so she had surgery but did not require any more chemotherapy			1
ms @entity4 has now been signed off by the bowel clinic but still has to have annual scans to check for kidney tumours			1
she said that she is now very hopeful about the future			0
she told @entity15 : ‘ it ’s all a bit surreal			0
until you talk about it you do n’t realise what has happened in such a short amount of time			0
’ to find out about @entity161 ’s campaign encouraging people across the @entity163 to take one million actions to ‘ @entity165 ’ , visit cruk.org / 1millionactions mrs @entity4 is not the only person to have benefited from giving blood			1
research published in the @entity169 has shown that donating blood reduces a person 's risk of heart attacks , and of cancer			2
@entity168 carried out by the @entity175 , in @entity176 , also revealed that giving blood burns 650 calories per pint			0
it is believed that these benefits all arise from the fact that giving blood temporarily reduces a person 's blood iron levels			2
@entity185 affects how thick and sticky the blood is			0
high iron levels cause the blood to be thicker			2
raised iron levels also accelerate the oxidisation process of cholesterol			0
this can affect blood consistency and create increased friction as it travels through blood vessels			0
as this increases wear and tear to the lining of arteries it could then contribute to cardiovascular disease			0
because donating blood removes some of its iron content , it may have a protective benefit if done on a consistent basis			2
a study published in the @entity208 also links iron to an increased cancer risk as it ’s believed to increase free - radical damage in the body			1
in line with this theory , a four - and - a - half - year study involving 1,200 people found those who made bi-annual blood donations had a lower incidence of cancer and mortality than those who did n’t			2
however , these benefits depend on making donations on a regular basis .			0

@entity4 was referred to @entity225 after her iron level was found to be low
this is a sign of bowel cancer because the cancer can cause bleeding into the bowel which depletes body 's supply of red blood cells
she was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy
four years after her bowel cancer , she was told she had a kidney tumour
was another primary tumour and was *unconnected* to the bowel cancer
she has now been free of cancer for two years
