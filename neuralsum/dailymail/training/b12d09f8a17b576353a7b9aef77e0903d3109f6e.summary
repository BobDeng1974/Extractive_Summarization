the pilot was flying a @entity25 from 1944 in an aerobatic sequence when its engine began to lose power			1
he responded immediately by lowering the landing gear and positioning the aircraft for landing , while informing air traffic control that he was in trouble			1
while he tried to carry out the manoeuvre the engine failed completely , with 21,000 people watching on in horror as the @entity25 billowed smoke and rapidly lost altitude			1
in a split second , lieutenant commander @entity2 decided to fly the aircraft to safety rather than eject and abandon the machine to its fate			1
by raising the undercarriage he improved the plane 's chances of gliding and smoothly handled the plane past the airfield boundary , avoiding disaster			2
although it was partly damaged , the aircraft is now being repaired and will fly again ' some time next year '			2

' when i was bouncing across the grass it was just like being in a bumper car			1
' the safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable			0
' horror : thousands of air show spectators in @entity70 watched last july as the plane developed a fault mid-air skill : the experienced pilot decided to try and save the plane at great personal risk instead of ejecting the father - of - two , who is stationed in @entity77 , @entity78 , joked that his wife @entity80 and daughters were only third on his list of calls after the incident			1
he said : ' the first people i called were the people who look after the aircraft , to tell them i was now looking at a very sad aeroplane on the side of the runway			0
they thought i was joking			0
' the second was the @entity93 at the base , saying " well , that did n't end up very well "			0
' and the third one was to the wife saying " had a slight engine issue , wo n't be back tonight but i wo n't be flying this weekend "			2
' i do n't think she was really listening because the kids were playing havoc in the background			0
' i said i 'd had a rough running engine and she kind of acknowledged it a little bit , but when i called her back i said it was a bit more than just a rough running engine			0
' wobble : the plane bounced off the runway like a ' bumper car ' before the undercarriage collapsed completely come to rest : the pilot , who has been awarded the @entity18 , joked his wife was only his third phone call rescue : the plane suffered extensive damage but restoration experts are optimistic that it will fly again there are still three to four @entity25 planes in the @entity6			1
first manufactured by @entity125 towards the end of the @entity10 , it was the last propeller - driver fighter to serve with the @entity3			1

' it is absolutely right that @entity197 has been awarded a @entity175 , ' he said			0
' he epitomised valour with his actions on that hillside in @entity201			0
' when you hear how events unfolded and the intensity of enemy fire , it is difficult to imagine how one would n't be frozen to the spot and yet @entity197 risked his life to run across that barren hillside not just once , but multiple times , to turn the battle and save the lives of comrades			2
' that is why he deserves the highest honour for bravery the nation can give			0

@entity2 , 44 , was flying @entity25 at @entity220 air show last year
the 70 - year - old plane began to lose power mid-air and he had to land it
in split - second *decision* he chose to save the *historic* fighter , not himself
flying skills meant he brought plane down safely in front of thousands
video of the landing has been viewed more than *300,000* times online
but honoured father - of - two said : ' it was just like being in a bumper car '
