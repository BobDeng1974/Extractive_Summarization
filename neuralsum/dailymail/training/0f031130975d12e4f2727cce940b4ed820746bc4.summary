by @entity0 no - one in the long history of major championship golf dating back to 1860 had ever followed up an opening 65 with another round equally as good			1
not in 78 @entity7 tournaments , 95 @entity8 , 142 opens or the first 113 editions of the @entity11			1
@entity12 hot : @entity13 carded a second successive 65 in the second round at @entity15 something special happened at the 114th at @entity15 yesterday , therefore , as @entity13 continued his remorseless brilliance to record a second successive score of five under par. his total of 130 strokes beat the old 36 hole record set by @entity24 in 2011 by one and opened up a six shot advantage at halfway			1
the only other players who have spread - eagled a @entity29 open field to lead by six at this stage are @entity24 three years ago and @entity31 in 2000			1
they went on to win by eight and 15 shots respectively			2
sensational : @entity33 's @entity13 holds a six - shot lead after just 36 holes at the @entity36 @entity13 ’s nearest pursuer is @entity29 @entity38 , who must be struggling to understand how he ’s so far in arrears after shooting 69 - 67			1
@entity40 will start eight behind while @entity24 is nine in arrears after a fine 68			1
@entity42 is on level par while defending champion @entity44 shot 69 and is on one over but @entity45 faded with a 74			1
@entity48 ’s @entity47 champion @entity46 shot 73 for a four over total only one shot worse than his playing partner , @entity51			1
the teenager made the halfway cut and is in prime position to conclude his glittering career in the non-paid ranks by winning the silver medal as low amateur			2
it was quite a day for young sportsmen from @entity61 , then , and @entity62 revealed afterwards that he and double centurion @entity64 had exchanged congratulatory texts			2
focused : @entity13 hits from a bunker on the 14th hole during the second round what an outstanding opportunity @entity13 has carved out for himself to follow up his @entity71 win in @entity72 last month with his second major championship success			1
to think , if he pulls it off , he will have won as many majors before the age of 30 as @entity77 , comfortably the finest @entity33 golfer of all time , managed in his entire career			2
he also holed a putt to win a @entity81 at @entity82 , lest we forget , whereas @entity77 , alas , missed one			2
what feels like a coronation waiting to happen can look something different altogether , of course , when a player has had more than 24 hours to sleep on his performance			2
it ’s fairly safe to assume the greens will harden up for the final two rounds and chipping from tight lies is not @entity13 ’s strongest suit			1
chasing : @entity24 remains in contention but will need something special to catch @entity13 but the 29 year old from @entity98 has a formidable record as a frontrunner and it will be a surprise if he does n’t add this trophy to the @entity8 title he won in 2010			1
he looked like he might dominate the game thereafter but found being world number one and the demands on his time at odds with his aversion of the spotlight			2
while he adjusted , he fell outside the world ’s top 50			0
happily , those days of struggle are now behind him , but he retains a nice sense of perspective			0
asked by an @entity29 how this performance would play in the media back home with the @entity118 now underway , he replied : ‘ i ’m thankful @entity33 do n’t play until monday , so i might get a mention or two			0
and if i win , it would play well until the time of the game against @entity123 and then it would be forgotten			0
’ impressive : @entity48 amateur @entity46 made the cut at @entity15 in reality , @entity13 is due home in ten days ’ time to play in the @entity127 being staged in @entity128 , just a 40 minute drive from where he was brought up			1
you can be sure one or two people would turn up if he was @entity133			0
what a performance he has put on here to date			0
he needed just 63 shots to play the back nine over the first two days and deserved the odd moment of fortune that came his way			0
at the 18th , following a rare stray drive into the ‘ native area , ’ he smiled to himself as he found his ball sitting like a cherry on top of a cake			0
a couple of errant iron approaches also allowed him to show off his bunker prowess , while he never looked like missing a holeable putt			0
close up : @entity51 and amateur @entity46 line up a putt on the second green alongside a member of the elite at the top of his trade we had romance too , in the shape of 49 year old @entity29 @entity160			0
he might be the ultimate example of a journeyman pro. he ’s spent his career largely on the @entity164 , the satellite circuit one rung below the @entity166			0
in his forays on the main circuit dating back to 1988 , he ’s made a total of $ 195,000			0
to put that figure in perspective , there are 173 players on the @entity166 who have made more than that this season alone			0
one of the great joys of the two opens on either side of the @entity177 is that players can come through qualifying and take their place on the biggest stages			0
with his 15 year old son @entity182 on the bag , the not so mighty @entity160 belied his lowly status with a marvellous first round 68 to be tied second after the opening day			1
could he keep it going ? he wobbled in the middle of his second round but a 74 meant he comfortably made the halfway cut			1
he will get to enjoy quite a @entity191 alongside his son tomorrow .			0

@entity13 recorded a second successive score of five under par
his 130 strokes beat the old 36 hole record set by @entity24 by one
@entity24 is nine in arrears after a fine 68 in second round
@entity42 is level par while defending champion @entity44 is one over
