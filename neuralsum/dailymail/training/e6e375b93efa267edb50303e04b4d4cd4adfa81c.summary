by @entity0 it has been five years since @entity2 died , yet his career is more alive than it has been in decades			1
just last month , the singer moon - walked across a @entity6 stage in a nationally televised hologram performance			1
a new album recently debuted at no. 2 on music charts			1
and a traveling @entity11 show based on @entity2 's songs has logged nearly 500 performances worldwide			1
it has been five years since @entity2 died , yet his career is more alive than it has been in decades ( pictured in march 2009 , just three months before his death ) the result has been an estate that has earned more than $ 600 million since the @entity2 's untimely death at age 50			1
some of the earnings support @entity2 's three children and mother			1
yet an analysis by @entity0 shows much more has gone to erase the singer 's massive debts and to run the estate that powers his robust posthumous career			1
as would be expected , the last five years have brought their share of change and adjustment for @entity2 's children , known to the world as @entity36 , 17 ; @entity37 , 16 ; and @entity38 , 12			1
they were at their father 's rented mansion on june 25 , 2009 , when he was given an overdose of the anesthetic propofol in his upstairs bedroom			2
and they were at the hospital several hours later when he was pronounced dead			0
it would take more than two years before @entity2 's doctor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity36 , @entity38 and @entity51 pictured on stage at the @entity53 in @entity54 in october , 2011 ( the children are supported by the earnings ) a father who taught his children philanthropy , threw them lavish birthday parties and meticulously masked them from the paparazzi is gone			2
@entity2 , however , continues to provide			2
nearly $ 20 million had been spent to support @entity2 's children and his mother , @entity62 , through 2012			1
payments to the family have increased each year since june 2009 , according to court records			0
adulthood will bring a sizeable inheritance for each child			0
in the meantime , lawyers have busily untangled @entity2 's finances , which itself has been expensive			1
among the disbursements between mid- 2009 and the end of 2012 : more than $ 91 million on taxes and licenses , including $ 45 million paid to the federal government for taxes			2
more than $ 25 million in compensation for the estate 's executors , @entity2 's longtime attorney @entity82 and family friend and music executive @entity83			1
the men receive a percentage of the estate 's earnings			1
more than $ 17 million to lawyers who represent the estate , @entity62 and her grandchildren			0
nearly $ 4 million to properly store and archive the trove of personal belongings and unreleased music that @entity2 amassed during his lifetime			2
' this is a complex estate with unique issues , ' said @entity62 's attorney , @entity99 ' under all the circumstances , mrs. @entity51 and the children are certainly being well cared for			2
' @entity99 , who has conducted audits of the estate 's spending , said everything is in order and detailed financial records match precisely what has been presented in court			0
' it 's surprising how big the numbers are , but then when you realize what goes into it - and that a judge has approved those numbers - then it becomes not so shocking , ' said @entity118 , an attorney who specializes in probate litigation			0
while @entity2 craved success , his priority in later years was his children			2
the trio is a large part of the singer 's legacy , and the music , dance moves and business pieces he left behind assure them a comfortable , if not care - free , lifestyle			1
@entity2 's children live with their grandmother in a hilltop home in the celebrity enclave of @entity136 , home to the @entity138 family , @entity139 and many others			1
the estate pays for private schools and tutors , a chef , private security and family vacations , giving the @entity2 children the stability their father strived to provide			2
' @entity2 's number one priority was his children , not wealth or fame , ' said @entity154 , the attorney who successfully defended @entity2 against child molestation charges and stays in touch with his family			1
' he wanted them to get the best education possible , ' @entity154 said			0
' he wanted them to be worldly			0
' although the family 's privacy is carefully protected - neither @entity154 nor @entity99 would discuss specifics - some domestic drama has become public in recent years			0
brought back to life : @entity2 hologram performed in @entity6 in may ( pictured ) in 2012 , @entity62 was absent for 10 days when some of her children took her to an @entity171 spa , causing a family rift that resulted in @entity173 , an adult cousin of @entity2 's children , being named their co-guardian			1
@entity37 and @entity36 were deposed in @entity62 's lawsuit against the promoters of her son 's planned comeback concerts			0
