clearly her new role as a @entity3 ambassador left her with little time to make her first store as immaculate as she might have liked			1
and it meant frantic preparations were still taking place at @entity10 ’s shop in the final minutes before it opened its doors			1
windows were boarded up , while the paintwork was still being finished			1
boxes were still arriving , and there were reports of bags of clothes seen lying on the ground , not yet hung up on rails			1
and it shocked the customers who had been queuing for hours outside			1
many began speculating the opening might never happen , with some giving up and going home			2
the last - minute preparations shocked the customers who had been queuing for hours outside many began speculating the opening might never happen , with some giving up and going home the shop has employed a modern look and does not have tills or even a window display one , @entity56 said : ‘ it ’s just shoddy really			1
i ’ve seen inside when someone came out and there ’s all builders and bare floorboards , it ’s a mess			0
there ’s no ways it ’s opening today , no way			2
‘ they could n’t even be bothered to sweep the fag ends off the steps			0
and the steps are crumbling , it ’s a disgrace , i would be ashamed if i was her			0
i do n’t even like the woman , i was just hoping @entity75 might be coming down			1
i do n’t care about her shop but she ’s making a mockery out of her fans			2
i thought there would be more people here than this but they have n’t missed much			0
’ @entity82 , 24 , said : ‘ it seems quite last minute thought it would have been ready , they ’ve been doing it long enough			0
but i ’ve been here since 9 and it ’s been a bit frantic , lots of touching up and stuff			2
’ mrs @entity10 has advertised the launch of her store on @entity94 over recent weeks and has described it as a family affair @entity75 was on hand to man the store in his wife 's absence , while mrs @entity10 ’s mother , @entity101 , her father @entity102 and sister @entity100 also dropped by mrs @entity10 was at the @entity3 in @entity103 with world leaders on the shop 's opening day , where she was named goodwill ambassador another woman , who did not wish to be named , added : ‘ it ’s not a terribly welcoming sight			1
’ the shop is mrs @entity10 ’s first stand - alone venue , although her collections are also stocked in @entity114 ’s and online retailer @entity115			1
in a recent interview the designer insisted the shop will be a family affair , with mr @entity120 on the door , mrs @entity10 behind the till and their eldest son @entity122 , 15 , working as a saturday boy			1
the couple have three other children : @entity127 , 11 , @entity128 , 9 , and two - year - old @entity129			2
and after using @entity94 to publicise the store in recent weeks , it was indeed a family affair - with @entity75 , mrs @entity10 ’s mother , @entity101 , her father @entity102 and sister @entity100 dropping in			1
outside the shop onlooker @entity135 , 46 , said : ‘ the fact she [ mrs @entity10 ] is not here is a massive disappointment			1
i really , really hoped she would be			0
it ’s such a shame			0
she ’s let a lot of people down			0
’ @entity120 minds the shop : new goodwill ambassador @entity10 wows @entity3 in @entity103 as her first fashion store opens its doors in @entity24 by @entity145 they were separated by 3,500 miles and two rather different jobs			1
in six - inch heels , @entity10 click - clacked in the footsteps of world leaders at the @entity3 in @entity103 yesterday and made an impassioned plea to safeguard women ’s health and stop babies dying of @entity154			1
and husband @entity75 ? he stayed at home to mind the shop			1
the new shop in @entity28			2
while @entity10 hung out with world leaders at the @entity3 in @entity103 , her husband @entity75 stayed at home to mind the new shop in @entity28 the world - renowned footballer - cum - charity do - gooder swapped roles temporarily with his fashion leader wife to allow her to make her political debut on the world stage			1
meanwhile he bowled up in scuffed brown shoes for the launch of the @entity170 ’s swish new clothing store			2
ordinarily , those who queued for a first glimpse of @entity174 ’s sales floor might have expected their heroine to oversee the opening			2
but even as they scrambled for a peek inside , perhaps equally excited at the prospect of meeting @entity180 , @entity10 was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the @entity3 after being made an international goodwill ambassador			1
the role gets her instant membership of a celebrity club that includes @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , who have all used their star status to draw attention to @entity3 good works			0
in a sober suit , and with barely a hint of her trademark pout , the 40 - year - old said she was ‘ humbled and honoured ’ to represent the @entity3 in its @entity154 campaign , adding : ‘ for some reason people will listen to me			2
this is the beginning of an incredible journey for me			0
’ despite it being the opening of her store , @entity10 was unavoidably elsewhere – wowing them at the @entity3 after being made an international goodwill ambassador the role gets the former @entity208 instant membership of a celebrity club that includes @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , who have all used their star status to draw attention to @entity3 good works that journey appears to have been inspired by a trip to @entity214 , where she met children stricken by @entity154 and spoke to afflicted mothers			1
the visit was part of the @entity220 initiative , which tackles the issue of @entity222 being transmitted from mother to child			0
‘ i came home and i knew i had to do something , ’ the mother - of - four said yesterday			2
‘ i think every woman has the right to health , and every woman has the right to give their children a healthy future			0
’ @entity236 , she said ( that ’s sir @entity238 ) was a ‘ dear friend ’ of her and her husband , and the couple had been patrons of the piano player ’s @entity241 for 20 years			0
‘ babies should not be born with @entity222 and we can stop that , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m a mother , a woman , and i want to reach out and help as many women and mothers as i can			0
’ back in @entity24 , @entity75 - who was wearing scuffed brown shoes - was reaching out to help his wife ’s other interests back in @entity24 , @entity75 was reaching out to help his wife ’s other interests			1
her store is a bold venture into traditional retail as opposed to online shopping			0
@entity261 , that is , until you step inside the shop			0
it would have been fun to see @entity120 behind a till , for example – but there are n’t any			0
sales are made through @entity268 , doing away with anything so vulgar as a cash register			0
there is no window display , and the goods are arranged with the minimalist chic of an art installation ( or , depending on your point of view , in a way that makes it look as if the shop has already been burgled )			0
@entity10 will be there from time to time – but she has other agendas			1
at the @entity3 she said she would be back in @entity214 in a few weeks ‘ and then further afield next year ’ .			0

frantic preparations were still taking place in final minutes before opening
windows were boarded up , boxes were arriving and clothes were on ground
the sight shocked customers who had been queuing outside shop for hours
mrs @entity10 insists shop is family affair - husband @entity75 opened the store
