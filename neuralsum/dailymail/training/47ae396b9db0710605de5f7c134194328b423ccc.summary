keep fit fanatic @entity2 , 39 , said a debilitating stroke left him with a limp and he could only walk 75 metres in five minutes			1
he pocketed over £ 17,000 in state handouts after saying he needed help getting in and out of the bath and getting up and down the stairs			1
but @entity2 ’s run of luck ran out after investigators secretly filmed him swimming , cycling and running for a total of 55km during the @entity21 triathlon in @entity22 , @entity23			1
the footage showed @entity2 swimming for 5 kilometres whizzing past spectators on his bicycle during a 40k race and later raising his arms in victory as he completed a 10k run			1
he completed the entire course in just two and a half hours			2
today @entity2 , from @entity33 , @entity34 had been facing jail after he admitted a charge of failing to notify the @entity37 of change of circumstances			1
but he was given 12 weeks prison , suspended for a year , and ordered him to carry out 100 hours of community service by magistrates in @entity34 after they were told how he had lost the respect of his friends and family			1
the court heard @entity2 had initially claimed benefit legitimately in 2006 after suffering a stroke that year			1
as well as disability handouts he also claimed income support , housing benefits and council tax benefit			2
prosecutor mr @entity54 said : ' on a medical form provided to the @entity37 , it put him at a higher rate for mobility and lower rate for care due to a stroke suffered that left him with a weakness to the left side , virtually unable to walk and only able to walk 75 metres in five minutes			1
' he was left with a limp and needed someone with him when he went outdoors			1
it permanently affected him 24/7			0
the lower rate was because he needed help getting in and out of the bath , tying his shoelaces and preparing his food			2
' it is accepted that his disability were not commensurate with the claim he made			0
' surveillance was made between august 2010 and february 2011 at considerable costs			0
during these observations @entity2 is seen completing a triathlon event in september 2010 at @entity21 , a feat of physical endurance , 5km swim , 40km bike ride and 10km run , that ’s the athletic endurance			1
he was seen the previous day covering his bike			0
' he was employed during labouring duties , his employer was aware that had had a stroke and missed only 10 jobs out of 81			2
the fraudulent abuse of the benfits system prejudices the very needs of the proper applicant who are wholly dependent on this type of benefit for these vulnerable and needy people			0
' the court heard the over payments from june 2010 to july 2011 were £ 5850.29 in income support , £ 3997.64 in disability living allowance , £ 6187.34 in housing benefit and £ 1.057.80 in council tax benefit			2
fit : the footage also shows @entity2 whizzing past spectators on his bicycle during a 19k sprint benefits : as well as disability handouts @entity2 also claimed income support , housing and council tax benefit in mitigation defence lawyer @entity136 said : ' it is the case that although he suffered a major attack in 2006 , the affects are still on going and he has difficulty moving , and if speaking for any length of time his speech becomes slurred			1
at work he is often accused of having a drink over lunch time because of his speech			0
' all that seems hollow when he completed a triathlon in a good time			2
prior to 2006 , he was an athlete who regularly took part in events of this nature			0
the assessment was that he could n’t walk any further than 75 metres			1
' he said @entity2 got back into training because he ' wanted to become fit and healthy again ' , adding : ' it was a challenge to himself to see if he could do it again			2
but a month later he suffered a mini stroke			2
' had he not taken this decision , he is of the belief that he would not be as well as he is today and would still be in receipt of a genuine benefit claim , ' said mr @entity136			0
he went on : ' he accepts that he claimed benefit when he should n’t have			0
he has said that at the time when he continued to claim benefit his future was uncertain and had suffered two mini attacks			0
' he planned to set up a business but did n’t know if it would be successful , there was a very convenient safety net underneath him			0
you can see how easy it was for him to fall into the trap when deep down he knew he should n’t have			0
' he has now set up a floor polishing business with a partner			0
it has never been something that he kept secret			0
he is now working and no longer in receipt of benefits and he wants to pay back the over payments he accepts he had become over reliant on			0
' he has lost work as a result of the publicity and lost all the respect of friends and family			1
