by @entity0 a cataclysmic meteor impact in @entity2 that is linked to the death of many animals , including the woolly mammoth , may have also been the catalyst that triggered the start of civilisation as we know it , claims new research			1
evidence suggests a meteor struck @entity13 around 12,900 years ago and scientists believe this impact caused the @entity17 's climate to become colder and drier - known as the @entity19 period			1
these freezes and droughts led to some larger animals dying out which in turn forced humans to change their diet and develop agricultural methods to cultivate cereal , for example			1
evidence suggests a meteor struck @entity13 around 12,900 years ago and scientists now think this impact caused the @entity17 's climate to become colder and drier - known as the @entity19 period			1
previous theories thought the change was caused by an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the @entity36 the @entity19 period is also known as the @entity37			2
it was a period of cold climatic conditions and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago			1
scientists from @entity43 believe this change in climate was caused by an meteor impact , but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the @entity50 ice sheets			1
during the period , forests in @entity52 were replaced with a glacial tundra			0
there was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in @entity59			0
the drier conditions caused drought in the @entity62 , known as the region of @entity64 or the @entity65 , which led inhabitants to agriculture			1
the change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation			2
fragments of rock from the meteor are also thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun , causing temperatures to plummet , plants to die and landscapes to alter forever			0
in @entity50 particularly , big animals including mastodons , camels , giant ground sloths and sabre - toothed cats all died out			1
the meteor strike is also thought to have caused the demise of the @entity87			2
human hunters turned to a subsistence diet of roots , berries and smaller game to survive			0
meanwhile thousands of miles away in the eastern @entity65 , the first farmers started growing cereals			0
the scientists claim that this invention of agriculture was a pivotal step in the development of large settled communities and civilisation			2
experts agree on the climate change that marked the start of the @entity19 period , but are divided about its cause			2
the new research is said to provide ' conclusive ' evidence that the trigger was a meteor impact			2
before now , the most popular explanation has been an ice dam rupture releasing huge amounts of freshwater into the @entity36			0
this in turn was thought to have shut down ocean currents moving warm tropical water , resulting in colder conditions			0
the meteor is thought to have struck forests in southern @entity13 in @entity2 , pictured , around 12,900 years ago scientists analysed spherules , droplets of solidified molten rock , deposited in @entity127 and @entity128 at the start of the @entity19 period			1
they identified geochemical ' fingerprints ' exactly matching the profiles of rock found in southern @entity13			0
although no ' smoking gun ' crater had been found , this was a strong clue that the spherules had been created by the massive temperatures and pressures of a meteor impact in @entity2			0
the findings appear in the journal @entity141			0
professor @entity142 , one of the study authors from @entity144 in @entity43 , @entity145 , said : ' the @entity19 cooling impacted human history in a profound manner			0
' environmental stresses may also have caused @entity149 in the @entity150 to settle down for the first time and pursue agriculture			0
' during the @entity19 period , also known as the @entity37 , around 12,800 years ago a change in climate caused many large animals to die out			1
this forced humans to develop agricultural methods ( modern farming pictured ) to gather food and is thought to have led to a rise in communities and civilisation			1

evidence suggests a meteor or asteroid struck @entity13 12,900 years ago
this impact caused a change in climate that made @entity17 colder and drier
larger animals died out and humans began eating berries and cereals
an *increase* in agriculture and communities led to modern - *day* civilisation
