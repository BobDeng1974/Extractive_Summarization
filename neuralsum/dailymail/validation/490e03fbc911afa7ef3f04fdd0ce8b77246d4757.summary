this is the moment a sailor was pulled from the @entity2 after he survived 100 minutes in the freezing water , which left him hearing voices and close to death			1
@entity7 was swept overboard and battled 66ft waves in conditions he described as ' like being in a washing machine '			1
he was uncertain his crew had even noticed he was missing but was determined to survive because ' it would be unfair on mum to die on her birthday ' , he said			1
mr @entity7 was thrown in the sea eight months into the @entity16 and watched the yacht disappear over the horizon			1
fearing his legs were both broken after being hit by the rudder , hypothermia then set in and he began hallucinating and hearing voices			1
but he had activated his emergency beacon and the boat returned almost two hours later to rescue him - and a doctor on board saved him by packing him in a sleeping bag filled with hot water bottles			1
he has now turned his diary entries from the trip into a book and will donate the profits to charity			1
' it was like being in a washing machine , ' he said , recalling the dramatic march 2014 rescue			2
the 47 - year - old continued : ' i thought i was going to die but decided , " it would be unfair on mum to die today "			1
' he described the lead up to the incident which took place eight months into the race			2
' the conditions were rough and storms were coming in , ' he said			2
' our sails were too big for the weather and the boat had become difficult to handle			2
' we had to change the sails			2
' while mr @entity7 was doing this , a wave crashed on board and dragged him overboard			1
he said : ' it took a fraction of a second and i had no time to react			2
one minute i was on board , the next i was in the water			2
' i tried to take a breath but it was too cold			2
i waited for my safety line to snag then realised it was n't attached to the boat			2
' then i was hit by the rudder , which , at 15ft high and 6in thick , ran over me			2
i thought my legs were broken as i watched the boat disappear			1
' i swore as it went over the horizon and thought about my last conversation with the skipper , @entity85 , about going to get a tool			0
' i wondered if my crewmates had seen me fall off the boat			0
' on the horizon : mr @entity7 floats in the sea after he was thrown in and battered by the boat 's rudder grabbed : a member of the crew swings in to the water to grab the stricken sailor , who took three attempts to get back aboard saved : mr @entity7 was stripped and warmed up using large amounts of hot water bottles packed into a sleeping bag mr @entity7 said at this point he was sure the yacht would return for him soon			1
he said : ' we 'd trained in ' man overboard ' so i activated the @entity108 beacon , attached to me , which i knew would show my location on a screen on the boat			1
' i thought the boat would stop , turn round and pick me up			1
' i pulled the pin out of my beacon and it started flashing			1
' i checked the straps on my life jacket were tight and it was fully inflated , then i waited for the boat			0
' i thought it would be back in around 15 minutes			0
' i was confident the boat would return			0
' for a long time i saw the boat in the distance and thought it must have stopped			0
' i saw the mast but only a glimpse of the deck and thought , ' if i ca n't see the deck , they ca n't see me '			0
' mr @entity7 said he began to wonder if his beacon had worked and alerted the crew to his disappearance			1
he continued : ' i was constantly under the waves			1
it felt like i was in a washing machine			0
' with time i realised i was in a bad place			0
i was suffering with the cold			0
i started to drift off as i struggled to stay conscious			0
' i felt relaxed , comfortable , euphoric and knew these were signs of hypothermia			0
' i knew going to sleep would mean game over			0
i had to focus on myself , my job was staying alive			0
' so i turned to face the wind hoping to get cold and stay awake			1
i talked to myself about family and friends and i remembered my mum 's birthday			1
' i was annoyed and disappointed that i had n't messaged her yet that day			0
i decided it was unfair to die on mum 's birthday and that gave me strength			1
' that was the biggest thing that kept me going			0
' then he began to hear voices			1
mr @entity7 said : ' i thought my mind was playing tricks on me but i focussed on them and they seemed to be getting louder			1
' suddenly the boat was bearing down on me			0
' i saw some people and made eye contact			0
my friend @entity168 was already in the water in a harness			0
' journey : mr @entity7 was on board the @entity174 yacht , pictured leaving the dock in @entity176 , at the @entity178 start last year celebrating : @entity7 is second left here on a stopover in @entity181 before he was thrown overboard last march conditions : but later the boat was being hit with huge waves in the @entity2 , which in the end swept off mr @entity7 and nearly killed him the team on board tried to grab hold of mr @entity7 , attach him to mr @entity168 's harness and haul him up out of the water			1
he said : ' by the third attempt i wondered if i had the energy and would get on the boat			0
i was cold inside me , my face was sore and my body was aching			0
' it felt like i was being run over by a bus			0
i could n't get my breath			0
i felt like i could drown			0
' turnaround : mr @entity7 's legs were bruised and swollen and after he had six days intensive physiotherapy he then decided he wanted to carry on with the race finally , with the whole crew forging together , mr @entity7 was pulled out of the water almost two hours after he 'd gone overboard			1
he said : ' it felt like a lifetime , everyone was working hard			0
i do n't know where i got the strength to get back on board			0
' mr @entity7 was taken below deck and put in a sleeping bag which was packed with bottles filled with hot water , to warm him up			1
he said : ' for the next four hours my muscles ached and i was in and out of consciousness			1
i was treated for hypothermia and @entity221 , the medic , monitored me for the next 48 hours			2
' mr @entity7 's legs were bruised and swollen			1
he had six days intensive physiotherapy then decided he wanted to carry on with the race			2
he said : ' it 's called round the world for a reason and i planned to get back on board			2
it was intensely difficult and i was physically sick beforehand			0
' but the last four months of the race were tremendously enjoyable , and we finished fourth			0
' mr @entity7 has now turned his experience into a book			1
he called it 179w – one seven @entity235 , named after the exact coordinates where he went overboard			2
proceeds from the sale of his book will go to mr @entity7 's chosen charities – the @entity241 and the @entity242 .			1
