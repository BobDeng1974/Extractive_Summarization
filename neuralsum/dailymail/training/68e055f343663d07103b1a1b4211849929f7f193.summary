‘ he put the options to me , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i just said yes			0
’ that night , he confesses , was a blur of celebration			0
never mind that the deal involved an annual pay cut of about £ 4million , to £ 8m , he jumped at the chance to realise his father ’s ambition for him — to race alongside @entity21 , who has joined from @entity22			2
@entity3 ( second left ) is revealed as part of the @entity4 2015 line - up alongside @entity21 ( second right ) and reserve driver @entity25 ( centre ) @entity21 ( left ) joins @entity4 from @entity22 while @entity3 is staying put despite speculation about his future on thursday , @entity3 , who only finally inked his new contract on wednesday night , was still wreathed in smiles at the pair ’s unveiling at @entity4 ’s @entity34 headquarters			1
the man who was vying for @entity3 ’s seat , 22 - year - old @entity37 @entity25 , handled himself manfully as he was paraded as the team ’s test and reserve driver			1
he was given his bad news by @entity8 on tuesday			0
from being the long - term favourite to partner @entity21 , his career had suddenly stalled			1
@entity3 insists his heart has ' always been at @entity4 ' after signing a new contract with the @entity10 team @entity21 and @entity3 pose inside @entity4 's technology centre in @entity48 on thursday morning the 2009 world champion , @entity3 , has been retained by @entity4 for the 2015 season two - time world champion @entity21 will re-join @entity4 from @entity22 , having left in 2007 @entity8 tried to console @entity25 in his comments			1
‘ look at his poor little face , ’ he said at one point			0
it sounded more patronising than @entity8 intended			0
and , after all , @entity25 was his original choice for the seat			2
so what happened ? how did @entity3 replace the @entity37 in @entity4 ’s affections ? the answer seems to lie in the complicated boardroom dynamics at @entity48			2

‘ and i have enormous respect for @entity21			0
i do n’t want to mention my late father ( @entity86 ) too much but , probably as much as me winning the world championship , he wanted me and @entity21 to race on the same team together			0
’ @entity21 ’s arrival at the @entity48 - based team , on a three - year deal worth £ 75m , was in the pipeline long before the @entity4 hierarchy decided on @entity3 ’s future			1
‘ @entity97 ’ conversations between the team and @entity21 began in september 2013 , though he admits he was only truly convinced to move this past summer			0
