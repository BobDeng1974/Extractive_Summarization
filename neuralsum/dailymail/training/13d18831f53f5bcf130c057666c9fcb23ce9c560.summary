@entity2 taught about the importance of people paying their tax , the archbishop of @entity1 claimed today			1
the @entity7 @entity6 said companies and people should pay their ' fair share ' in the country where they had made their money , but part of the problem was an ' unbelievably complex ' tax system			1
the remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention as @entity18 and @entity19 clashed in the @entity20 over tax avoidance			2
he told the @entity30 : ' there has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money			1
if you earn money in a particular country , the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned			1
' highlighting the complexities of the international tax system , he said : ' someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions			1
well , the @entity48 's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages ? they are several hundred times that			1
' there needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place			2
' he added that there was a ' very basic principle ' that ' as a @entity60 we see that @entity2 spoke of , about the importance of people paying what is due '			1
' the @entity48 speaks of it endlessly , ' he said			1
it is the archbishop 's latest intervention on economic matters , having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks			0
he stressed that ' business is important ' , adding : ' we need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth , but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power			0
' there 's a reality of the human condition , of what @entity60 call sin , what the @entity48 calls sin , which says do n't misuse the power you have got through wealth			1
' asked whether some people were doing that he said : ' there 's always elements where that happens , because people are people			0
' but the response to that was not to ' throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad ' - instead , ' solidarity ' and an improved regulatory framework were required			0
at prime minister 's questions , @entity18 and @entity19 clashed in the @entity20 over tax avoidance at prime minister 's questions , mr @entity19 accused the prime minister of failing to act to close a tax loophole for hedge funds because ' too many of his friends would get caught in the net '			0
he repeatedly pressed the prime minister to close the tax loophole which allowed hedge funds to avoid stamp duty on stock - market transactions ' costing hundreds of millions of pounds '			0
the @entity117 leader claimed : ' this is a prime minister who wo n't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net			0
' they are the party of @entity126 hedge funds and @entity128 tax avoiders and under him you will always know it 's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else			0
' but mr @entity18 hit back : ' when we came to office foreigners did n't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought			0
foreigners did n't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought			2
' and because of your tax rates @entity145 hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices			2
that 's what we had to sort out			0
