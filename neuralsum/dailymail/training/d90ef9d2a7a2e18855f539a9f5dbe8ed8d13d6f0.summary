by @entity0 the former poster boy of @entity4 's so - called ' ex-gay ' movement who last year left his wife to return to homosexuality has launched a scathing attack on @entity9 , declaring : ' you do n’t understand this issue at all '			1
@entity12 - once the nation 's leading advocate of so - called gay conversion therapy - issued the verbal assault after the @entity17 governor compared homosexuality to alcoholism in an interview earlier this month			1
@entity9 was forced to apologise after he suggested that a gay person in a same - sex relationship is no different to an alcoholic who chooses to drink			2
' i may have the genetic coding that i 'm inclined to be an alcoholic , but i have the desire not to do that , and i look at the homosexual issue the same way			0
' now @entity44 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , hit out at the politician in a comment feature for @entity49			1
' this was n’t just some political mistake , ' writes @entity44			1
' what worries me more is the ignorance betrayed by @entity9 ’s comments - an ignorance that i believe is still widespread among conservatives in the straight world - about what being gay means			1
' sparking controversy : @entity9 's original comments came during a conversation about ' reparative therapy ' that @entity17 @entity64 formally endorsed in their party platform this week			1
' @entity66 ? ' @entity44 became such a well - known figure in the ' ex-gay movement ' that he even appeared on the front cover of @entity70 in 1998 alongside wife @entity71 beneath the headline , ' @entity66 ? ' @entity9 ’s original comments came during a conversation about ' reparative therapy ' that @entity17 @entity64 formally endorsed in their party platform this week			1
practitioners of the controversial treatment - also called ' gay conversion therapy ' - claim to be able to turn homosexuals straight with a variety of techniques that critics argue are both psychologically damaging and ineffective			1
techniques include electric shock therapy , inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material , praying , exorcism , trips to brothels to have sex with women and hypnosis			2
the wife : @entity44 became ' straight ' in 1990s , married @entity71 ( pictured ) , a former lesbian and had three children with her but @entity44 has now completely abandoned the movement , vowing instead to fight the ' widespread misunderstanding in the straight world ' that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice			1
' i do not want young gay women and men today to go through what i went through , ' he writes			2
' i want to tell them - and @entity9 : we are not broken , damaged , inferior or throwaways			0
we are created in the image of @entity109 - just like everyone else			0
' of his own past , he writes : ' i was in denial			0
it was n’t in fact true , any of it			0
worse than being wrong , it was harmful to many people - and caused me years of pain in my own life			0
which is why i have this to say to the @entity123 of the world : you do n’t understand this issue			0
' during the 1990s , @entity44 became the most visible proponent of ' reparative therapy ' claiming it had ' healed ' him , allowing him to marry @entity71 and have three children			1
he became such a well - known figure in the ' ex-gay movement ' that he even appeared on the front cover of @entity70 in 1998 alongside wife @entity134 but last year , he revealed that he was in fact gay after all and had left the movement			1
' my beliefs have changed , ’ he told @entity139 , which stands for @entity140			0
' today , i do not consider myself “ ex-gay ” and i no longer support or promote the movement			2
' it was a huge departure from @entity44 ’s prime ex-gay days , when he founded and ran a ministry called @entity148 based on ‘ reparative therapy			1
’ @entity44 also penned two books on the subject : not afraid to change : the @entity152 and @entity148 , which he wrote with his wife , who also claimed to have rid herself of her own homosexuality			1
he wrote the piece after the @entity158 revealed they are now endorsing so called restorative therapy to ' cure ' homosexuality			1
change of mind : mr @entity12 , right , is pictured in drag for a 1990s photoshoot after his conversion from gay to straight ' reparative therapy is , by definition , based on the notion that something is “ broken ” in one ’s identity , needing repair , ' he writes			1
' you are meant to feel like damaged goods , and the therapy is designed to fix that			2
' he goes on : ' in a nutshell , gay conversion advocates argue that boys who grow up to be gay over-identify with their mothers and remain detached from uninvolved , weak , passive , disinterested fathers			1
' treatments for ' curing ' homosexuality claim to change a person 's sexuality through techniques such as electric shock therapy , inducing nausea while being exposed to homoerotic material , praying , exorcism , trips to brothels to have sex with women , and hypnosis			1
some advocates of the therapy have also asserted that prayer and religious faith can be helpful in suppressing or overcoming same - sex attractions			2
the @entity203 have warned that the therapies run the risk of causing serious psychological harm			0
gay rights groups agree saying the therapy damages young people , because it tells them that it 's not acceptable to be whoever they are			1
the largest christian ministry engaged in such work , @entity214 , also closed last year and its leader apologised to the gay community for inflicting ' years of undue suffering			1
' @entity219 and @entity220 have both passed laws barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay youth straight , and both laws have been upheld in court			1
' i was told by my @entity228 mentor that one thing i needed to do to increase my sense of masculinity was to quit my job as a chocolatier because i was surrounded by too many women , ' he writes			0
' my mentor suggested i get a job in the business world where there were more men			0
' he remained at the forefront of the ex-gay movement until september of 2000 , when he was photographed in a @entity244 gay bar			2
by 2012 he could not live the lie any longer			0
' i deeply loved my wife , @entity71 , who still believed in the movement , and i knew it would be extremely scandalous to embrace homosexuality after the career i ’d had , ' he writes			2
' but it was more and more apparent to me that i was what i always had been : gay			0
' in the end he decided to abandon his old life and ' come out ' for a second time			0
' today , for the first time since i was a young man , i ’m not living a double life - a life that is a lie , day in and day out			0
i have no more secrets than the next person , ' he adds			0
@entity44 now supports himself in the food service industry , running a catering company in @entity45 , @entity46 called @entity266 , and says he no longer profits from his former job			2
at their annual conference in @entity271 on saturday , the @entity17 @entity64 party adopted the policy of ' reparative therapy ' , which tea party groups had advocated			1
one particularly influential group , the @entity275 , had urged the party to support the psychological treatments , which claim to try and turn homosexuals straight			0
president of the conservative group , @entity17 values @entity278 welcomed the decision saying it comes as no surprise			2
he explained : ' the platform reflects what the people in the @entity64 have asked for , and that should be no surprise : family values , protection of marriage between one man and one woman and everything that goes along with that			0
' but adopting the policy has sparked controversy even amongst members of the @entity158 , some of whom had been lined up to speak out against endorsing such therapy			0
they never got the chance to address delegates , because a parliamentary motion to approve the full platform was called first			0
@entity304 , vice president of the gay conservative group @entity305 , who was due to speak said : ' there 's a very , very small group of people who want to keep the party in the past			2
we were here today to try to pull the party into the future			0
' the only way the party can go into the future is to start listening to young people , to start listening to people who have gay family members			0
