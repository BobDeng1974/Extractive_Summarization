by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 4:57 pm on 9th august 2011 prowling in the vicinity of a number of tents , this hungry polar bear is photographed just a week before it went on a ferocious rampage which left one @entity9 - educated teen dead and four other @entity10 seriously wounded			1
the images , taken by a @entity13 sea captain , were snapped only a few miles away from where @entity14 was killed by the ravenous 39st animal , on @entity18 island in @entity19			1
the captain took the photographs as he was worried that the 14ft beast would attack the camp - similar to the one set up by the @entity24 only days later			0
this polar bear - thought to be the same one which killed a @entity28 and seriously wounded four others - is seen prowling near to a camp in @entity19 a flare is shown ignited , which - on this occasion - scares the adult male polar bear away , leaving the campers safe			1
@entity36 , a @entity38 tour guide at the camp , said : ' the bear came out but did n’t try to get into any tent			2
he just looked around and smelled the air			0
' she said that it was possibly the same bear as it appeared to weigh around 200 - 250kg ( 31 - 39stone ) - the same size as the bear that took @entity14 ’s life			0
it is believed that the flare - triggering defence systems in place at the @entity24 camp were faulty , which allowed the animal to enter the campsite early on friday morning and being its attack			0
@entity14 , 17 , was ' ripped to pieces ' by the polar bear according to @entity57 , who was in the tent next to the aspiring doctor when bear attacked			1
the 14ft animal is shown bolting - and not attacking any humans - after a flare is triggered near to the @entity38 camp a photograph of @entity14 , taken on his own camera only two days before he was mauled to death by a polar bear the @entity69 - based 16 - year - old suffered a fractured skull after being bitten on his head - he punched the animal in the face during the attack and his father hailed him a hero for ' fighting for his life '			1
@entity78 , 16 , also survived , having been in the same tent as @entity80 and @entity57			0
in addition trip leaders @entity82 , 29 , from @entity83 and @entity84 , 27 , who is from @entity85 but lives in @entity86 , were severely injured in the bear attack , but are now stable			0
@entity88 , who was sailing in northern @entity19 , took these astonishing pictures of the bear approaching the camp			2
@entity92 ( left ) shot the polar bear and fellow team leader @entity94 ( right ) was also injured in the attack @entity57 , 16 , saw @entity14 ' ripped to pieces ' in his tent and managed to survive the polar bear attack in contrast to the flares at the @entity38 campsite , when the bear approached the camp where @entity14 was staying with nine other youngsters and two adult leaders , the safety tripwire failed to trigger			1
it has emerged that the wire system was not fixed firmly in the ground - so it fell over when the bear trod on it , according to a @entity19 police investigation			2
in a further mishap , the ‘ old ’ @entity114 hunting rifle failed to fire four times			0
the bear was eventually killed by mr @entity82 on the fifth attempt , despite the fact that he had been severely mauled by the animal			2
safety precautions at the site have been criticised in the @entity19 media			1
@entity123 , who organises expeditions at the @entity125 said that in 15 years of expeditions on @entity129 , members of the university had only had to shoot one polar bear			1
‘ you could say that if you come into a situation where you have to shoot a bear , then you have done something wrong , ’ he told the @entity132 newspaper			0
@entity137 , head of international litigation at law firm @entity139 , who has experience of lawsuits involving wild animals attacking tourists said @entity14 's family , and injured participants on the trip , would be able to sue the @entity24 if it could be shown ‘ reasonable steps ’ to ensure the safety of the expedition			0
mr @entity137 said : ‘ reasonable steps need to be taken to ensure people are safe , and while it ’s too early to tell in this case , there are serious questions that need to be answered by the organisers of this trip			0
’ the aftermath of the attack is shown - the bear appears to be dead , shot in the middle of the cluster of tents the 14ft bear is hauled to the awaiting helicopter after his bloody rampage meanwhile yesterday @entity14 's parents released an image of their killed son , after his digital camera had been returned to them by the @entity19 police			1
the picture shows @entity14 standing by a glacier on the @entity174 island			0
wearing sunglasses and smiling , he appears to be enjoying the adventure of camping in the @entity19 islands			2
two days later he was mauled to death by the polar bear .			1
