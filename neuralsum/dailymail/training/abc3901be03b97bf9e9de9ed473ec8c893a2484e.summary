fearing a @entity1 invasion and occupation of @entity3 , the @entity5 government in the early @entity6 years recruited and trained fishermen , bush pilots , trappers and other private citizens across @entity3 for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military , newly declassified @entity15 and @entity16 documents show			1
invasion of @entity3 ? yes			1
it seemed like a real possibility in 1950			2
' the military believes that it would be an airborne invasion involving bombing and the dropping of paratroopers , ' one @entity16 memo said			0
the most likely targets were thought to be @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
declassified : fearing a @entity1 invasion and occupation of @entity3 , the @entity5 government in the early @entity6 years recruited and trained fishermen , bush pilots , trappers and other private citizens across @entity3 for a covert network to feed wartime intelligence to the military , newly declassified @entity15 and @entity16 documents show feared the @entity1 : @entity42 teamed up on the highly classified project , code - named @entity44 , with the newly created @entity45 , headed by @entity42 protege and former @entity16 official @entity47 so @entity16 director @entity42 teamed up on a highly classified project , code - named ' @entity44 , ' with the newly created @entity45 , headed by @entity42 protege and former @entity16 official @entity47			1
the secret plan was to have citizen - agents in key locations in @entity3 ready to hide from the invaders of what was then only a @entity5 territory			1
the citizen - agents would find their way to survival caches of food , cold - weather gear , message - coding material and radios			1
in hiding they would transmit word of enemy movements			1
main players : this 1961 photo released by the @entity66 shows air force lieut			0
gen. @entity68 upon his nomination to first director of the @entity66 this was not civil defense of the sort that became common later in the @entity6 as @entity5 built their own bomb shelters			1
this was an extraordinary enlistment of civilians as intelligence operatives on @entity5 soil			1
this account of the ' @entity44 ' project is based on hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents			1
the heavily censored records were provided to @entity85 by the @entity86 , a website that publishes government documents it obtained through the @entity89			0
the @entity1 never invaded , of course			0
so the covert cadre of ' stay - behind agents , ' as they were known , was never activated to collect and report wartime information from backwoods bunkers			1
it was an assignment that federal officials acknowledged ( to each other , if not to the new agents ) was highly dangerous , given that the @entity99 's military doctrine called for the elimination of local resistance in occupied territory			1
to compensate for expected casualties , a reserve pool of agents was to be held outside of @entity3 and inserted by air later as short - term replacements			1
this assignment was seen as an easier sell to potential recruits because ' some agents might not be too enthusiastic about being left behind in enemy - occupied areas for an indefinite period of time , ' one planning document noted dryly			1
' @entity44 ' was not , however , a washout			0
it operated from 1951 - 59 , according to @entity117 , official historian of the @entity45 , or @entity45			1
' while war with the @entity99 did not come to @entity3 , @entity45 trained 89 @entity121 ( stay - behind agents ) , and the survival caches served peacetime purposes for many years to come , ' she wrote in an @entity45 magazine last year			1
with the benefit of hindsight , it would be easy to dismiss ' @entity44 ' as a harebrained scheme born of paranoia			0
in fact it reflected genuine worry about @entity99 intentions and a sense of @entity5 vulnerability in a turbulent @entity138 period			1
as the plan was being shaped in 1950 , @entity99 - backed @entity139 invaded @entity141 , triggering a war on the peninsula that some in the @entity145 saw as a deliberate move by @entity147 to distract @entity148 before invading @entity149			1
the previous summer the @entity99 stunned the world by exploding their first atomic bomb			0
also in 1949 , the @entity5 locked arms with @entity149 to form the @entity154 alliance , and @entity156 's revolutionaries declared victory in @entity158 , adding to @entity5 fear that communism was on the march			1
@entity44 : this undated handout image obtained by @entity85 shows an @entity15 chart showing the organization , by function and lines of authority , of the @entity44 project close : a map shows the jarring proximity of @entity1 to @entity3 , the closest point of which is just 2.3 miles from country to country via the islands of @entity175 and @entity176 ' @entity44 ' was known inside the government by several other codenames , including @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , according to an official @entity15 history of the @entity45 , which called it one of @entity45 's ' most extensive and long - running @entity6 projects			1
' the @entity16 had its own code word for the project : @entity187			2
' @entity44 ' had two phases			0
the first and more urgent was the stay - behind agent program			0
the second was a parallel effort to create a standby pool of civilian operatives in @entity3 trained to clandestinely arrange for the evacuation of downed military air crews in danger of being captured by @entity99 forces			2
this ' evasion and escape ' plan was coordinated with the @entity202			0
among those listed as a stay - behind agent was @entity205 of @entity206 , a community on the @entity208 south of @entity30			0
a well - known bush pilot , @entity205 died in a plane crash on @entity211 in @entity212 in may 1955 at age 45			0
@entity16 records say he spent 12 days in @entity148 , in june - july 1951 undergoing a range of specialized training , including in the use of parachutes			0
the agents also got extensive training in coding and decoding messages , but this apparently did not always go well			2
learning these techniques was ' an almost impossible task for backwoodsmen to master in 15 hours of training , ' one document said			0
details in the document were blacked out			0
many agent names in the @entity45 and @entity16 documents also were removed before being declassified			2
none of the indigenous population was included			0
the program founders believed that agents from the ' @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 groups in the territory should be avoided in view of their propensities to drink to excess and their fundamental indifference to constituted governments and political philosophies			2
it is pointed out that their prime concern is with survival and their allegiance would easily shift to any power in control			0
' @entity253 : @entity44 was known inside the government by several other codenames , including @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , according to an official @entity15 history of the @entity45 , which called it one of @entity45 's ' most extensive and long - running @entity6 projects			1
' the @entity16 had its own code word for the project : stage recruiters pitched patriotism and were to offer retainer fees of up to $ 3,000 a year ( nearly $ 30,000 in 2014 dollars )			2
that sum was to be doubled ' after an invasion has commenced , ' according to one planning document			0
the records do not say how much was actually paid during the course of the program			0
at least some recruits were fingerprinted and all were secretly screened by the @entity16 for signs of disloyalty			0
the @entity16 linked one candidate , a resident of @entity274 , to a list of names in a 1943 bureau file on ' @entity279 activities , @entity3 ' that tracked @entity5 subscribers to a magazine called ' @entity282			1
' another candidate was flagged - falsely , it turned out - as a likely communist sympathizer based on an @entity16 informant 's tip about membership in the ' @entity289 , @entity279 , @entity290 , @entity148			0
' a september 6 , 1951 memo in which fbi director @entity42 says it 's time to pull the @entity16 out of @entity293 and refers to @entity294 one was described in a may 1952 @entity45 memo to the @entity16 office in @entity30 as the postmaster in @entity299 , @entity3 ; another was manager of a hotel in @entity302			1
one agent candidate worked for a tin - mining company at @entity305 on the @entity306 , one of the higher - priority areas for placing ' @entity44 ' stay - behind agents			2
the peninsula is named after secretary of state @entity31 , the primary negotiator in the 1867 purchase of the @entity3 territory for $ 7.2 million from czarist @entity1			1
the @entity16 tapped its local contacts , including federal judges , the head of the @entity317 in @entity30 , an @entity30 physician and others for names of reliable @entity3 to be approached			2
' @entity44 ' was crafted in painstaking detail			0
but just as the first trained agents were to be put in place in september 1951 , @entity42 pulled out , leaving it in @entity45 's hands , even though one month earlier his top lieutenants had advised him the @entity16 was ' in these programs neck deep , ' with an ' obvious and inescapable ' duty to proceed			1
@entity42 worried that when the shooting in @entity3 started the @entity16 would be ' left holding the bag			1
' ' if a crisis arose we would be in the midst of another ` @entity294 ' and get part of the blame , ' @entity42 wrote in the margin of a sept. 6 , 1951 , memo from an aide , to whom @entity42 added one final order : ' get out at once			2
' three years later , @entity42 was pulled back in , briefly			2
in october 1954 , an envelope and a typewritten letter containing a coded message were turned over to the @entity16 by a woman in @entity30			0
it had been misaddressed by the anonymous sender in @entity29			0
espionage was suspected , triggering flurries of @entity16 internal memos			0
@entity42 was informed that bureau code breakers were urgently trying to decipher the message			1
they never broke the code but eventually declared the crisis over			0
the mystery message , they determined , was not from an enemy spy			2
it was a ' practice message ' sent errantly by one of the ' @entity44 ' agents .			2

@entity42 teamed with the @entity45 to roll out the project in 1950
the secret plan was to have citizen - agents in key locations in @entity3 ready to hide from the invaders of what was then only a @entity5 territory
agents would find their way to survival caches of food , cold - weather gear , message - coding material and radios
in hiding they would transmit word of enemy movements
