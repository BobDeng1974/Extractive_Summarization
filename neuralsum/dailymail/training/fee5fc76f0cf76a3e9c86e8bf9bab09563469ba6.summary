by @entity0 published : 17:04 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 17 november 2013 claims : doctor @entity2 was called ' not one of us ' by white colleagues at @entity5 in @entity6 a race row has erupted at a scandal - hit hospital where claims that up to 50 patients died as a result of alleged medical blunders were exposed by @entity12 last week			1
in an unprecedented move , 24 ethnic minority consultants from the hospital have written to the two main health watchdogs , the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) and @entity19 , protesting about ‘ bullying , harassment and racial discrimination ’			1
they say the 140 consultants at @entity5 , @entity6 – of whom about 90 are white – are split ‘ on racial and ethnic lines ’ , suggesting that a disturbing type of medical apartheid exists			1
it comes as the @entity18 has said it is to investigate the alleged blunders at ‘ high risk ’ @entity5 when it visits the hospital in the next few weeks			1
and it follows the revelation that a @entity36 mp , who is a doctor and whose constituency is served by the hospital , said he stopped his father having an operation there ‘ to save his life ’			2
the growing controversy over the hospital , which serves more than 440,000 people in the @entity47 , follows this newspaper ’s expose of a secret report commissioned by the hospital ’s bosses into claims of medical blunders and feuding consultants dating back 14 years			1
whistleblower @entity2 , an @entity56 born consultant at @entity5 , claimed up to 50 people may have died			2
his claims were dismissed by hospital bosses			2
but an official report by @entity61 , a medical investigations firm , and leaked to this newspaper , supported him			2
the dispute escalated yesterday following the letter signed by 24 ethnic minority consultants at @entity5			1
in an incendiary claim , they say patients ’ lives are being lost because serious errors by incompetent white doctors are covered up while ethnic minority doctors are victimised for minor mistakes on the operating table			1
their letter states : ‘ we are extremely concerned that patient safety is being compromised because of discriminatory treatment meted out to several ethnic minority consultants			1
this has included bullying and harassment , exclusion ( suspension ) as a first rather than a last resort , and other unfair treatment			2
‘ we fear the consultant body will soon be divided along racial and ethnic lines and indeed this may have happened already			1
we urge the @entity18 to investigate our concerns urgently in the interests of patient safety			2
’ ' we fear the consultant body will soon be divided along racial and ethnic lines and indeed this may have happened already ' - letter signed by 24 ethnic minority consultants the signatories comprise leading consultants from several departments at the hospital			1
most have @entity56 or @entity104 family roots , but a small number have @entity107 or @entity108 backgrounds			2
the @entity12 understands that seven ethnic minority consultants and doctors have been suspended in the past 18 months , while no white @entity112 consultants had been suspended			1
a source said : ‘ the ethnic minority doctors feel they are hammered for trivial errors			1
they feel the mainly white medical hierarchy look after themselves like an old boys ’ club and punish outsiders like naughty schoolboys			2
’ the @entity12 revealed last week how , when mr @entity2 first complained about blunders – a claim that was later upheld – an internal inquiry said his @entity56 background was ‘ not initially a problem ’			2
it added that colleagues of the ( white ) doctor that @entity2 complained about said ‘ he is one of us , whereas @entity2 is n’t ’			2
fear : people avoid the hospital which has a poor reputation			2
@entity36 mp @entity133 said it is not fit for purpose @entity137 ’s poor reputation was highlighted by @entity133 , @entity36 mp for nearby @entity139 , who is a doctor and still practises as a gp			2
mr @entity133 ’s father , @entity141 , 66 , needed surgery and was due to be operated on at @entity5 , but his son sent him to another hospital			2
mp mr @entity133 said : ‘ i decided he would get better care elsewhere			2
i did it to save his life			0
you can die on the operating table			0
@entity5 is no longer fit for purpose			0
’ a @entity18 spokesman said : ‘ @entity137 will be inspected because it has been flagged as being potentially high risk			0
all information , including the @entity61 report , will be considered			0
’ one of the consultants highlighted by @entity12 last week , @entity157 , who , according to the @entity61 report , had ‘ @entity159 ’ outbursts , has been given two weeks paid time off by the hospital as a result of ‘ stress ’ caused by last week ’s expose			1
it will cost taxpayers £ 10,000 to provide cover for him			0
@entity5 is reportedly £ 80million in debt owing to mismanagement			0
mr @entity157 declined to comment			0
a spokesman for @entity5 was asked for a comment but failed to respond yesterday			0
the parents of a premature baby boy who died shortly after birth have won a six - year battle for compensation , after the hospital tried to ‘ cover up ’ its failings , writes @entity177			1
@entity178 died at @entity179 in @entity180 18 days after being born prematurely , at 27 weeks			1
his parents @entity182 and @entity183 were told @entity178 was profoundly brain damaged and that he died of ‘ extreme prematurity ’			1
but looking back after the initial shock of their son ’s death in december 2007 , they became suspicious they had not been told the truth , feeling staff had been ‘ edgy and evasive ’			0
in 2010 , with the help of solicitors @entity194 , the family launched a legal bid for compensation			0
tragic : premature baby @entity178 died at @entity179 18 days after being born at 27 weeks now they have been awarded a five - figure sum in a @entity200 court after a judge ruled hospital staff had failed to ventilate the baby properly			1
the pressure they used was too low , so @entity178 ’s lungs did not inflate properly			0
this meant he was starved of oxygen , causing severe brain damage and his eventual death , found recorder @entity211			0
' we feel it was a cover - up			0
we think they knew from the start they had made a mistake			0
they 've added insult to our injury ' - @entity222 , mother of baby @entity178 the hospital had denied negligence			1
lawyers for the @entity227 argued @entity178 had been born with dry lung syndrome , in which there is insufficient fluid for lungs to work properly			0
but the judge ’s verdict was that ‘ it was the failure to apply the proper pressures which caused @entity178 ’s death ’ , concluding ‘ therefore , the breach of duty did cause @entity178 ’s death ’			0
mrs @entity222 said : ‘ we feel it was a cover - up			0
we think they knew from the start they had made a mistake			0
' by putting us through the ordeal of a court case instead of being honest , they ’ve added insult to our injury			1
’ a @entity179 spokesman said : ‘ we are extremely sorry the care @entity178 received did not meet the standard we would expect and apologise unreservedly to @entity222 and mrs @entity253 for the loss they suffered following his death in 2007			1
’ doctors at a hospital where staff fiddled cancer records told a pensioner he had the killer disease when what he really had was gallstones , writes @entity266			1
@entity267 , 81 , spent two years thinking he was close to death when he should have been enjoying retirement			0
he was ‘ doped up to the eyeballs ’ on morphine after being told by doctors at @entity272 in @entity180 that he had cancer of the gallbladder and bile ducts			1
@entity276 has been placed in special measures after a @entity17 report found a number of cancer patients suffered ' undue delays ' at one stage , mr @entity267 was given six months to live – and counted down the weeks			1
the retired engineer kept on living , however , and was informed this august that there had been a mistake : his illness had been not tumours , but gallstones			1
mr @entity267 was fit and active until the misdiagnosis was made and he was put on morphine			0
he now has to use a mobility scooter to get around			0
' two years of morphine treatment for a cancer i never had has destroyed me			1
i felt like a zombie most of the time ' - @entity267 , 81 he said : ‘ two years of morphine treatment for a cancer i never had has destroyed me			1
i felt like a zombie most of the time			0
i ca n’t believe what ’s happened			0
it ’s an unimaginable situation			0
’ he intends to sue the hospital over the misdiagnosis			0
his solicitor , @entity304 of @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 , described it as ‘ bizarre ’ – but said he was investigating a similar case of a patient wrongly given chemotherapy			0
a spokesman for @entity276 said it had apologised to mr @entity267 for the distress and was investigating			0
