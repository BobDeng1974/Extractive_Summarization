by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 predator : @entity5 is said to have abused boys for decades the mp who blew the whistle on sir @entity5 ’s four decades of child abuse last night demanded a full public inquiry into the scandal			1
as police announced a probe into an alleged cover - up of @entity5 ’s activities in @entity18 , @entity13 ’s @entity12 said a wider probe was needed to examine how far the network of paedophiles extended and how the political establishment kept it quiet			1
he said the @entity24 must reveal all the information they had at the time about the abuse			1
the call for a public inquiry will put more pressure on @entity31 – the party ’s leader in the late @entity34 and @entity35 – who has claimed he knew nothing of the allegations			1
mr @entity12 , whose book @entity39 : the double life of @entity5 was serialised in the @entity42 this month , said : ‘ what we need is a much larger public inquiry that looks at what @entity5 was involved in , not just in @entity18 but the cover - up in @entity48 and elsewhere			1
‘ look at what happened to @entity5 , what he was involved in			2
look at who he was in networks with in terms of this type of abuse and also take evidence from elsewhere and look at the wider cover - up			0
’ writing in today ’s @entity42 , he adds : ‘ make no mistake : the identities of many of these men have long been known to the police			0
they must be made to face the law before , like @entity5 himself , death allows them to escape scot free			2
‘ @entity5 ’s sphere of influence stretched far beyond @entity18			2
i believe he was part of a vip paedophile ring which was active in @entity48 and other parts of the country , with protectors at the highest level of the @entity78			0
’ senior @entity24 dems including @entity80 have said they knew little of the true extent of @entity5 ’s abuse , except for a report in the @entity84 in 1979			1
mr @entity80 has said he sees no need for an internal inquiry , claiming it is a matter for police			1
mr @entity12 ’s book tells of appalling events at @entity92 residential school in @entity18 where boys say they were abused by @entity5 and other men			1
nine men have come forward to tell police they were abused at @entity92 from the 1970s			2
eight more claim they were abused in the 1960s at @entity98 , a privately - run hostel for boys			0

yesterday , sir @entity128 , chief constable of @entity129 , said his force would also conduct an inquiry into allegations that @entity133 , which had responsibility for @entity92 , had covered up sex abuse claims			1
he added : ‘ as a result of the publicity and the discussion around the book recently published about child abuse in @entity18 , we are carrying out a review into those allegations and other matters of public debate around that book to see whether that justifies a criminal investigation into allegations of cover - up			1
’ @entity133 said it was also widening the scope of its own inquiry into @entity92 in light of mr @entity12 ’s book			1
but last night the care worker who blew the whistle on abuse at the school in 1994 condemned police and the council			0
@entity161 , the school ’s head of care , said : ‘ police and the council have had evidence of the abuse that went on for two decades but all they have done is cover it up			0
‘ they have documents that clearly show @entity92 was a sweet shop for paedophiles who would travel the country to come and abuse boys there , and yet 20 years later we are still waiting for these abusers to be brought to justice			2
it is not only an insult to the victims , it is an insult to society itself			0
’ in 2000 , @entity129 carried out a ‘ comprehensive investigation ’ into abuse claims at @entity92 which led to the conviction of one man for indecent assault and gross indecency			2
they said there was insufficient evidence to charge any others and no specific allegations were made against @entity5			2
however , last year the @entity192 said that under today ’s guidelines @entity5 would have been charged			0
mr @entity12 ’s call came as victims of the sex - abuse scandal accused the police of ‘ abandoning ’ them			2
despite having the names of 11 suspected child abusers for 18 months , sir @entity128 admitted his force had failed to question any of them			0
@entity5 and his friend @entity203 were among a gang of abusers who for years beat and raped boys at @entity92 , a residential school for vulnerable children			1
both were school governors who had a set of keys and they would saunter around eyeing up young boys and watching them as they showered			0
@entity5 and @entity213 , a 6ft 5in former @entity215 officer who was a @entity216 councillor , attacked victims as young as seven			0
abuse : @entity5 ( pictured ) and his friend @entity203 were among a gang of abusers who for years beat and raped boys at @entity92 , a residential school for vulnerable children the school for those with learning difficulties opened in 1969 and was described as a ‘ sweet shop for paedophiles ’			1
but when a whistleblower on the staff of the 50 - bed facility in @entity18 raised concerns , he was threatened with the sack			0
according to @entity12 ’s book , head of care @entity161 became aware of the visits by @entity5 and @entity203 , who died in 2001 aged 80			1
mr @entity161 said he complained four times but his concerns were dismissed and he was threatened with the sack			0
matters came to a head in 1992 when a ten - year - old boy , shaking with fright , told mr @entity161 he had been sexually assaulted			0

mr @entity161 called the police , who arrived quickly but failed to take the matter further			0
in the headmaster ’s unlocked office , mr @entity161 found and copied a devastating report written by an hiv prevention officer which warned that pupils were at risk of @entity263			0
this meant , mr @entity161 said , that the boys had been abused by paedophile gangs			0
‘ they were like lambs to the slaughter , ’ he said.mr @entity161 said education and social services chiefs were made aware but ‘ the action that was taken was zero ’			0
the @entity260 report , not naming @entity5 or @entity213 , was later published and the scandal forced @entity92 ’s closure in 1994			1
but mr @entity161 then received phone calls threatening his children			0
