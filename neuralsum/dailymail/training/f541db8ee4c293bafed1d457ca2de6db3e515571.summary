by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 04:33 est , 3 august 2012 hundreds of air passengers narrowly avoided a massive mid-air collision when three @entity4 commuter jets came within seconds of each other after a mix up by air traffic controllers			1
the @entity8 is now investigating how the three @entity10 jets flew within feet of each other at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 on tuesday afternoon			1
a federal official told the @entity16 that confused air traffic controllers had launched two outbound flights directly at another plane coming in to land			2
when the controller realised her mistake , all three planes , which were carrying a a total of 192 passengers and crew members , were just 12 seconds apart			1
she immediately ordered one of the planes to change course			1
no one was hurt and all three planes reached their destinations without further issue			2
the @entity8 said preliminary investigations show that the two outbound planes came within 500 and 600 feet respectively of the incoming jet			2
close call : the three @entity10 jets were carrying a total of 192 passengers			1
pictured , a flight arrives at the airport , which serves @entity54 , on thursday backed up : it is just the latest error made by air traffic controllers at increasingly busy airports the mishap occurred as air traffic controllers decided to change flight courses in a response to a storm brewing just south of the airport			1
controllers at @entity66 , @entity14 changed the runway and direction from which planes were landing and taking off at the airport , and told the controller tower at the airport of the plan			1
the near miss at @entity12 in @entity14 is just one mistake of many recorded in recent years			1
the @entity8 recorded a staggering 1,234 operational errors in 2009 and this jumped to 1,887 in 2010			0
last year , there were 1,895 recorded mistakes			0
among the 2011 figures , there were 50 of the ' most serious incidents ' - those that put aircraft closest to each other or that have the greatest chance of causing collisions			2
last year , the @entity8 took action against more than half a dozen controllers for mistakes after napping on the job during night shifts , including controllers at @entity12			1
in another near - miss in 2010 , a heavily - loaded @entity96 plane leaving @entity97 passed within a few hundred feet of a single - engine propeller plane			2
last year , a controller put two jets on a collision course at @entity104 's @entity103 before a supervisor spotted the mistake ; the jets were just 225 feet apart in the air			1
' the tower agreed , but they did n’t pass it on to all the people they needed to pass it on to , ' a federal official told the @entity16			0
when the controller at @entity118 realised the mistake , radio recordings show she ordered the pilot to make a quick turn to the south			1
' we were cleared [ for landing ] at the river there , ' the pilot said after the turn , the @entity16 reported			0
' what happened ? ' the controller simply responded : ' stand by , we ’re trying to figure this out			0
' when she told him to fly one more time around the airport to begin landing , he warned : ' we really do n’t have enough fuel here for this			0
we have to get on the ground pretty quick			0
' the @entity8 said it is investigating the incident			0
' during the switchover of operations , miscommunication between the @entity142 and the @entity12 tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for @entity148 , ' @entity8 spokeswoman @entity139 told @entity149			1
' the @entity8 ... will take appropriate action to address the miscommunication			0
' in a statement , @entity10 said : ' we are currently investigating and working with the @entity8 to determine what occurred			2
the safety of our customers and employees is always our top priority			0
' the mishap - which was only 12 seconds from devastation - is just one of the several thousand errors by air traffic controllers recorded across the country in recent years			1
hectic : the graphic shows the extensive network of routes flown by @entity10 across the country scene : the incident occurred after traffic controllers changed the route of the planes in response to bad weather - but the message was not properly communicated investigation : transportation secretary @entity178 held a news conference in @entity54 on thursday to argue against calling the incident as a ' near miss ' the @entity8 recorded 1,234 operational errors in 2009 and this jumped to 1,887 in 2010			1
in 2011 , there was a minor increase to 1,895			0
just last year , an air traffic controller at the same @entity14 airport was found sleeping during the overnight shift , and several controllers were suspended or fired by the @entity8 after the revelation			2
a passenger as @entity12 told @entity193 7 he was not surprised by the near miss. ' you have to remember that people make mistakes and this is part of the problem , ' @entity194 said			2
' it 's happened to me			0
we were landing and had to take right off again because they were crowding the runway			0
these things happen and it 's frightening			0
' video : listen to the exchange between air traffic control and the planes ...			0
