' it 's really frustrating			1
he has already missed out - he keeps missing out			0
' @entity33 started @entity62 in september , and his dad insists the @entity40 school initially had no problem with his hair , which is long on top and short on the sides			1

there is no legislation relating to pupils ' uniform or appearance , which is left up to school 's governing bodies to decide			2
but schools often impose bans on ' extreme ' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy			0
the @entity129 does advise that pupils who do n't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school ’s published behaviour policy			0
a head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach			0
but if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change , then the pupil ’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded			0
if a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion			0

he said : ' we have many pupils with a short back and sides but the school rules regarding haircuts state that hair must not be shorter than a grade two			1
' this information is given to parents when a child starts at the school			0
' at the start of the school year when he joined us , we reminded @entity33 of the school rules regarding haircuts because his hair was a 0.5 grade , much shorter than the rules allowed			1
