a school that banned @entity1 and other energy drinks has seen the number of pupils being given detentions plunge by a third			1
in the latest piece of evidence that the drinks can cause poor behaviour in the classroom , staff said standards were transformed after just two terms			2
drinks such as @entity15 , @entity1 and @entity16 combine so much sugar and caffeine that @entity20 advisers warn they make children hyperactive and difficult to control			1
@entity22 , headteacher at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 ( pictured with a group of year 9 pupils ) , said there had been a marked change in pupils ' behaviour since the school banned energy drinks some 500ml cans contain the equivalent of more than 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine – about the same as in four cans of cola			1
the ban was suggested by @entity42 pupils at @entity23 in @entity25			1
head teacher @entity22 said : ‘ research would suggest that levels of concentration among some young people are negatively affected by highly - sugared energy drinks			1
‘ some students who use these can not learn at their best			0
the consumption of vast quantities of “ empty calories ” can lead to health concerns , including obesity and dental issues			0
’ to help encourage fellow pupils to ditch energy drinks , members of the school ’s student council designed a water bottle with the @entity63 fundraising group			1
@entity23 ( pictured ) said pupils designed a new water bottle to encourage fellow students to give up energy drinks and opt for healthier choices instead			1
the school has noticed an improvement in behaviour these bottles were offered to pupils in return for a pledge to go further than the ban and steer clear of all fizzy , sugary drinks in exchange for water			1
in years 7 , 8 and 9 , more than 95 per cent of pupils signed up , along with more than 70 per cent in years 10 and 11			0
earlier this year , @entity20 adviser and restaurateur @entity82 called for energy drinks to be banned in schools - saying the beverages were as harmful as drugs			1
he said drinks such as @entity15 , @entity1 and @entity16 make children difficult to control			1
mr @entity82 said : ' energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs			1
the amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools			0
‘ it has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate , how they feel and it is having health effects			0
' as well as the fall in the number of detentions , achievement and general behaviour levels rose – a trend @entity113 put down to the ban			2
councillor @entity115 , of @entity117 council in @entity25 , said : ‘ it is good to see it was the students themselves that recognised the effects high - caffeine drinks were having and the benefits drinking water as an alternative can have			0
’ earlier this year , restaurateur @entity82 – who founded the @entity129 fast - food chain and advised ministers on improving youngsters ’ nutrition – said : ‘ the amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is effectively allowing drugs into schools			0
‘ we do n’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school life			0
it has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate , how they feel and it is having health effects			0
’ another school that reported improved behaviour after banning energy drinks is @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152 , which in 2008 blamed them for pupils being noisy , late for lessons and failing to follow instructions			1
energy drinks have been widely criticised			2
a survey last year found that one in 20 teenagers goes to school on a can of energy drink rather than eating a healthy breakfast			0
@entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , banned leading energy drinks such as @entity1 and @entity15 former x factor judge @entity166 blamed them for the seizure her daughter @entity170 had last year			1
manufacturers and retailers have a voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to under - 16s , but there is no law to stop children buying them			2
a spokesman for the @entity182 @entity181 said that while most energy drinks contain no more caffeine than a typical cup of coffee , ‘ we are clear that energy drinks are not recommended for children , and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents ’			2
for comparison , a 150ml can of @entity193 contains 8mg caffeine and 15.0g of sugar			0
according to @entity198 , a teaspoon is roughly 4 grams of white granulated sugar			0
@entity1 ( 250ml ) caffeine : 80mg @entity201 : 27.5g ( 11g per @entity202 ) @entity1 @entity203 ( @entity204 ) caffeine : @entity205 contains sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame @entity207 instead of sugar @entity15 ( 230ml / 8 fl oz ) caffeine : 80mg @entity201 : @entity210 @entity211 ( 680ml / 680 fl oz ) caffeine : 240mg @entity201 : @entity214 @entity215 ( 250ml ) caffeine : 80mg @entity201 : @entity216 the @entity217 advises that children limit their intake of drinks that are high in caffeine - saying the drinks ‘ could potentially lead to short - term effects such as increased excitability , irritability , nervousness or anxiety ’			1
a study by the @entity228 in @entity229 found that large amounts of caffeine can cause heart palpitations , fits and even death , as well as raising the risk of type 2 diabetes			0
heavy consumption has also been linked to a greater risk of depression , addiction and alcohol dependency			0
energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly , unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee , the study found			2
the @entity182 @entity181 code of conduct states that energy drinks should not be sold in schools .			2
