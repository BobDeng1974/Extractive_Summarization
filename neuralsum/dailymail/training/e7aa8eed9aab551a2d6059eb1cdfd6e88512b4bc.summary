scroll down for @entity18 admission : detective @entity9 , left , who was the lead csi investigator in the death of @entity11 , 33 , admitted that she had an affair with detective @entity13 , right , a ' gotcha ' moment for the defence fight : mr @entity16 , left , with attorney @entity24 , in a @entity26 court during beginning arguments in his murder trial defence attorney @entity29 asked @entity9 if it was true that she had intimate relations with @entity13			1
@entity9 danced around answering the question , instead telling the court : ‘ i am married and i have three kids and my job is important to me , ’ according to @entity36			1
she later said that her husband was aware of the affair , adding : ‘ i am happily married and i do n’t have any issues with that any longer			2
’ the tension reached boiling point when @entity29 accused @entity9 of perjury and asked simply – yes or no – if she had an affair with the detective			1
‘ yes , ’ she answered , before storming out of the courtroom , according to @entity46			0
the ‘ gotcha ’ moment was damaging to the prosecution , who is accusing @entity11 of strangling his wife in their @entity53 home in 2007			1
earlier this week , the @entity53 court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by a husband accused of strangling his wife to death , but whose defence claims died of a previously undetected heart condition			1
' @entity61 - i do n't know what is going on , ' @entity11 was heard by the court to say upon reporting finding his 33 - year - old wife @entity65 ( @entity67 ) unconscious on their bathroom floor in november 2007			1
' i do n't know what happened			0
she 's on the floor dying			0
' @entity73 - faced : @entity9 dodged the defence attorney 's questions several times before she was forced to answer about the affair on trial for the second - degree murder of his wife , the prosecution allege that the call occurred moments after @entity11 strangled his wife to death at their @entity84 , @entity53 , home			1
wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court , @entity11 watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife 's body covered in cuts and abrasions , which they said were not there hours before her death			1
' @entity98 died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation to her neck , and her husband is the one who did it , ' said prosecuting attorney @entity104 to the jury according to @entity106 according to the defence , @entity11 woke up and found his wife dead on the floor of their bathroom with her neck lying on a magazine rack in the early hours of november 7 , 2007			1
' the state 's evidence can not even prove that a homicide occurred , let alone that @entity16 did it , ' said defence attorney @entity116			0
the prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that @entity98 's death was murder , but @entity104 said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered			1
gone : @entity126 ( @entity67 ) @entity11 pictured here on her wedding day was found unconscious on the bathroom floor in november 2007 by her husband @entity16 , 39 ( left ) claims that he found his wife collapsed onto the magazine rack seen in the right picture in the couple 's @entity84 , @entity53 , home dr. @entity134 , @entity26 's chief medical examiner explained that ' only direct focused pressure ' consistent with pressure exerted by another person could have caused the deep bleeding discovered in the victim 's neck muscles			2
' a healthy , active woman , arguable in the best shape of her life , and all that ended because of the actions of that man , her husband , ' said @entity147 according to the @entity148 the defence team for @entity11 told the jury that @entity98 was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart , which could have been the cause of her collapse			1
they also concluded that the injuries to the mother - of - two 's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom			0
' this case is a tragedy of errors			0
an innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime , this is a prosecution in search of a crime , ' said @entity29			0
justice : judge @entity171 listens to an attorney in opening arguments during mr @entity16 's trial @entity104 , assistant state attorney , ( left ) gives an opening argument in the trial of @entity16 as @entity116 , attorney for @entity16 , ( right ) listens the death of @entity98 came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009 , 18 months after her death and only when @entity11 complained to the medical examiner 's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation			1
appearing in court in 2009 , the property developer 's defence initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death , @entity67 's first ever , which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to @entity36 however , the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of @entity67 suffering from a bad heart			1
' under the laws of science , it 's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened , ' said @entity104			0
together : @entity16 and @entity98 pictured on vacation were said to have had a happy marriage opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call , @entity11 was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing			1
the prosecution alleged that the information @entity11 gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks			2
' @entity67 had a bad heart , ' countered defence attorney @entity116			0
' you will hear no motive			0
no evidence of a motive whatsoever			0
no affairs during the marriage on behalf of @entity16 or @entity67			0
' no neighbours heard any arguments			0
' under house arrest with his two children since 2009 , @entity11 is supported by his wife 's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter ' suffered from seizures , from fainting , from headaches			1
' it was on november 6 , 2007 , that @entity233 received her first even spray tan , went to see a girlfirned who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body			2
then at 6 a.m on november 7 , a frantic sounding @entity11 phoned 911 to report his wife 's death , in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes			2
' oh @entity246 ! oh @entity246 ! @entity67 , ' cried @entity11 as he was instructed to give his wife @entity247			2
during the trial today , the jury heard from dr. @entity251 , a plastic surgeon who had performed breast - implant surgery on @entity98			2
not guilty : mr @entity16 was introduced by his defence team as a proud father and as a distraught widower he told told the court that he knew @entity67 to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms			2
the court also heard from @entity261 , @entity67 's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell			0
' she was dizzy , she called she called me			0
she was dizzy and on the floor , ” said @entity261 according to @entity46 the police first became suspicious of @entity11 after one officer noted that his @entity268 was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died			1
in addition , two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that @entity11 was dressed and that only one side of the pair 's bed appeared to have been slept in			2
the defence dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken @entity11 's identical twin @entity287 , who lived down the street and had come to the house that night , for his brother			2
lt. @entity291 reported that @entity11 told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomitting			2
vacation : in happier times @entity16 and @entity98 are pictured on the beach near to their @entity53 home the firefighter said that @entity11 changed his story at @entity301 and said that he found his wife 's neck resting on the magazine rack			1
he also added that he was wary of @entity11 's ' odd ' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry			0
' it was almost like an act , ' said @entity291			0
the defence have hired dr. @entity310 , the former medical examiner for @entity311 to debunk the prosecutions claims			0
' the investigation underlying this case was biased , incompetent , flawed and inept , ' said @entity29			0
