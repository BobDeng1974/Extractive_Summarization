@entity0 showed it is n't all work and no play in the @entity5 camp as the striker took time out to play ' no look beach tennis ' with assistant manager @entity8			1
the @entity10 striker , with paddle in hand , knocks the ball to and from @entity8 without looking and throws in a few twirls for good measure			0
the outing was for @entity8 's 38th birthday , as @entity19 wrote : ' celebrating @entity8 b - day in style with some no look beach tennis @entity22 ' @entity24 is n't the only one playing on the beach ... watch @entity27 's diving header ! to me , to you : @entity5 striker @entity0 and assistant manager @entity8 play together do n't look now : @entity19 knocks it back to @entity8 in a game of ' no look beach tennis ' it 's behind you : @entity19 was having a bit of fun to celebrate @entity8 's birthday in @entity38 backwards : @entity19 will keep his eyes open on the pitch , though , come saturday against @entity42 anything you can do ... @entity8 gets in on the act but they wo n't be joking on saturday 5 - @entity47 ( @entity48 ) 4 - @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity53 ( @entity38 ) 3 - @entity0 ( @entity5 ) , @entity54 ( @entity5 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 ) those in italics are out of the @entity63			1
@entity19 and @entity5 take on @entity42 on saturday to pursue a place in the semi-finals			2
but , on a personal note , @entity19 may have his eye on the @entity69 award			2
the @entity71 striker sits on three goals alongside team - mate @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity59			0
but a goal behind @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity53 , and two behind the impressive @entity47 on five			0
that can all change come saturday , though , should @entity19 continue his fine form in @entity78			0
@entity19 's @entity63 campaign has given those at @entity82 reason to be cheerful , as the former @entity84 goalscorer seems to enjoy life under impending boss @entity86			1
good spirits : @entity19 smiles at @entity54 during training as manager @entity86 ( left ) looks on training : @entity19 in training with his @entity5 team - mates ahead of saturday 's showdown			1
