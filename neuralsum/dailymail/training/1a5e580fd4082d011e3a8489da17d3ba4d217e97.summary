the @entity0 of @entity1 , @entity2 , became the laughing stock of the peewee football world when a parent posted video of the entire team getting sacked by a victory banner and it became a national sensation			1
late night host @entity10 took pity on the pint - sized players gave them do - over on @entity15 's ' @entity14 ' on wednesday			1
this time , it was a smashing success			1
' we 're actually wanted to bring them on the show , give them a shot at redemption by successfully breaking through a banner , but getting the team here would be pretty much impossible ... but here at the @entity14 , we like to make the impossible possible , ' @entity17 quipped			1
that 's not what happened the first time they tried			2
the first banner resulted in a hilarious pile - on as player after player hit the banner like it 's a brick wall			2
the two mothers who were holding the banner refused to let go , even as they watched the 5 - and 6 - year - olds of the @entity29 stumble head - first into disaster			0
the scene was meant to re-create the dramatic entrances of @entity64 teams who burst through paper banners to enter the field			0
pint - sized cheerleaders even lined the path to cheer on the conquering players			0
by the end , though , all of them were in a heap and their cheer squad was reduced to giggles			0
one even jumped with joy at the spectacle			0
the parent who posted the video on @entity34 revealed that the hilarious moment came after the team 's first home game			1
they won 24 - 0 .			0

*mighty* *mites* of @entity1 , @entity2 , were meant to break through a vinyl banner after *winning* their first home game
instead , the banner broke them
@entity10 *invited* the team on his show and gave them another banner to run through
this time they beat the banner
