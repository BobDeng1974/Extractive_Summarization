they camped in the @entity38 mountains where @entity22 died of exposure and dehydration while police do not suspect foul play in his death , it raises questions about the secretive group with which the couple were involved			1
at the @entity51 retreat , nearly 40 adherents pledged to meditate for three years , three months and three days			2
their only communication was by paper and pen			0
it was run by a divisive @entity16 - educated monk and @entity24 's former husband , @entity57 , whose teachings have been rejected as unconventional by some , including the @entity60			1
@entity57 , who had previously run a diamond business worth tens of millions of dollars , raised eyebrows for promoting @entity35 principles as a path to financial success , the @entity61 reported			1

others have cited concerning initiation ceremonies			0
a former volunteer , @entity74 , told the @entity61 that his involved ' kissing and genital touching '			0
another claimed she had blood drawn from her finger			0
divisive : @entity57 's teachings and rituals have been called into question			1
he and @entity24 lived in a yurt together , right , for years before she left him for @entity22 , their attendant another of his questionable practices was his secret marriage to @entity24 , which is forbidden by @entity91			1
it lasted more than a decade and ended in 2010 - a month before she married @entity22			1

but , as @entity109 reported , his version of celibacy was also questionable			0
' we are not allowed to have sex , but in yoga there are practices that involve joining with a partner , ' he said			0
' they are secret , and you are not allowed to disclose them			0
you might think of them as sex , but their purpose is to move inner energy			0
it takes very strict training			0
' together , the couple wrote books and presented lectures around the world			0
scene : @entity22 and @entity24 were asked to leave the retreat , pictured , after she revealed she had stabbed him ' when her martial arts practice went wrong '			1

he added that he wanted her to be able to legally claim his possessions if he passed away			0
but the union garnered derision from @entity35 scholar @entity148 , father of actress @entity149 , who said he should renounce his monastic vows - but @entity57 refused			1
the @entity60 's office called it ' unconventional behaviour ' and refused to see him when he travelled to @entity154 with his students in 2006			2

after , @entity57 was seen dancing in @entity159 clubs with @entity161 models			1
he said of the break up : ' you should see your partner as an angel who came to teach you			0
i look at @entity24 that way - the education is finished and now she is teaching a new person			2
if you try to see it that way , it helps your heart to hurt less			0
' criticism : @entity35 scholar @entity148 , left , and the @entity60 , centre , both turned their backs on @entity57 after it came to light that he had married her union with @entity22 seemed far from simple			1
in a lecture before they fled , she admitted he had become violent and she had stabbed him			2
she used a knife the couple had been given as a wedding present , but later claimed she was practising martial arts and it went wrong			0
he suffered three stab wounds to the chest			0
in a letter written after they left the retreat , she wrote : ' of course it was an accident ! i would never do harm to anyone ’s body on purpose , least of all my holy husband , who i adore			2
