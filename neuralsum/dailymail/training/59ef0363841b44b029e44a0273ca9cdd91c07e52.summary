one couple knows all too well the pain suffered by the parents of @entity3 , the @entity4 photojournalist executed on camera last month by the @entity6			1
@entity7 and @entity8 also lost their son @entity9 in 2011 , when the @entity13 soldier 's chinook helicopter was shot down over @entity14			1
now the couple are calling on president @entity16 to step down , citing his reaction to the @entity3 video and ' lack of leadership ' in confronting @entity21			1
the couple lost their own son , soldier @entity9 , in a 2011 helicopter crash in @entity14 killed in action : @entity13 soldier @entity9 was one of seven commandos killed in the 2011 chopper crash , in addition to an @entity14 translator and military dog			1
they were shot down by enemy combatants on monday , the @entity42 wrote a letter , calling out mr @entity16 's decision to go golfing after holding an important press conference on the @entity3 video			1
' as commander - in - chief , your actions - or lack thereof - mr president , cost lives			1
' as you bumble about in your golf cart , slapping on a happy face and fist - pounding your buddies , your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in @entity4 ’s security — but the security of the entire globe			1
' your message has come across loud and clear , sir : you are not up to this job			0
the world knows it , ' the @entity69 wrote in the letter published on @entity73			1
the couple go on to directly ask mr @entity16 to resign so that a man or woman ' of courage and substance ' can take over and address the ' out - of - control thug fest ' happening in @entity80 and @entity81 , where @entity21 is attempting to establish a caliphate			1
' as you bumble about in your golf cart , slapping on a happy face and fist - pounding your buddies , your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole , ' the @entity69 said of president @entity16 's decision to play a round after holding a press conference on the @entity3 tragedy vacation mode : president @entity16 was vacationing on @entity95 when the video was released by @entity21			1
he was photographed on the golf course at least two times after the video 's release ' it ’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters ... ' @entity4 has always been exceptional			1
and she will be again			0
you , mr president , are a bump in the road , ' they wrote			1
@entity23 told @entity113 that he has been displeased with the way president @entity16 has been acting at press conferences			1
' i 'd like to see him have some passion about anything going on in the world instead of just speaking in a monotone voice like he has a script that has been made up , ' mr @entity9 told @entity113			1
their only - son @entity9 was killed in august 2011 when a @entity126 helicopter was shot down in eastern @entity14			1
all 33 on board died in the crash , including @entity9 and several @entity13 members			1
@entity9 and his fellow commandos were attempting to reinforce a group of @entity132 after they ran into trouble during a raid to capture a senior @entity136 leader			2
@entity13 is best known as the group which carried out the execution of @entity139 in may 2011			1
after finally choosing to view the barbaric , on - camera beheading by @entity21 of freelance war correspondent @entity3 , i have been left with a level of rage known only to those of us who have sacrificed unspeakable offerings on the altar of world peace			1
my offering was my only son — @entity9			1
@entity9 was a member of @entity13			1
he was killed in action when a @entity152 , carrying thirty @entity4 and eight @entity14 was shot down in the @entity151 of @entity14 on aug. 6 , 2011			1
many times over the past three years , i have been asked what drove my son to choose his particular career			2
what made him want to be a @entity158 ? my answer is simple			0
@entity160 was a man who possessed the courage to acknowledge evil			0
and evil , once truly acknowledged , demands response			0
perhaps this is why so few are willing to look it in the eye			0
it is much simpler — much safer — to look the other way			0
that is , unless you are the leader of the @entity172			0
as commander - in - chief , your actions — or lack thereof — mr. president , cost lives			1
as you bumble about in your golf cart , slapping on a happy face and fist - pounding your buddies , your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in @entity4 ’s security — but the security of the entire globe			2
your message has come across loud and clear , sir : you are not up to this job			0
please vacate the people ’s house and allow a man or woman of courage and substance to seize the reigns of this out - of - control thug-fest and regain the balance we , @entity4 , have provided throughout our great history			2
thanks to your “ leadership ” from whatever multi-million dollar vacation you happen to be on at any given moment , the world is in chaos			0
what ’s been gained , you ’ve lost			2
what ’s been lost , you ’ve decimated			2
you ’ve demolished our ability to hold the trust of allies			0
you ’ve made a mockery of the title “ president			2
” and you ’ve betrayed the nation for which my son and over 1.3 million others have sacrificed their very lives			0
but this should come as no surprise , since your wife uttered a vile statement on feb. 18 , 2008 , during the primary campaign — one that speaks volumes of your true convictions			0
“ for the first time in my adult life , i am really proud of my country , ” she said			0
i am sure my deceased son thanks you for that , mrs. @entity241			0
oh , and you ’re welcome			0
never in my lifetime have i witnessed such despair and such growing fear that the world ’s last best hope , @entity4 , has finally been dismantled			2
perhaps the better word is transformed — fundamentally transformed			0
come to think of it , it ’s become difficult — if not impossible — to believe things have n’t gone exactly as you planned , mr. president			0
amazingly , in five short years , your administration has lurched from one disaster to another			0
you spearheaded the ambitious rush to end the wars in both @entity81 and @entity14 — with no plan on how to do so effectively			2
also , the release of “ the @entity136 five ” in exchange for one @entity4 — without consulting @entity261 — is also on your shoulders			2
you have been at the helm during unprecedented national security leaks — including , but not limited to the outing of @entity13 on the bin laden raid , the outing of the @entity269 doctor who provided the intelligence for that raid , the outing of @entity14 ’s @entity274 station chief , and the outing of your personal “ kill list ” to make you look tough			1
in addition , 75 percent of @entity4 deaths in @entity14 and 83 percent of @entity4 - wounded - in - action have occurred on your watch , according to icasualties.org			1
and now , we have this recent , heinous event : the beheading of an @entity4 citizen by a barbaric organization you foolishly referred to as “ the jv team ” in your statements to the @entity290 magazine in january			2
you , sir , are the jv team			0
it ’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters			0
@entity4 has always been exceptional			2
and she will be again			0
you , mr. president , are a bump in our road			0
