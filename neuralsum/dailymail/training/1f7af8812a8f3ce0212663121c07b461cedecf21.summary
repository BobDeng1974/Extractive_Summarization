a @entity1 man has spoken of his anger after buying what appeared to be a winning lottery ticket worth more than $ 500,000 - only for officials to claim it was a misprint and refuse to honor it			1
@entity8 , who has recently retired , bought the @entity9 scratcher - featuring the winning numbers ' 1 ' and ' 2 ' - from a @entity12 gas station in @entity13 , @entity14 , in december			1
as he started scratching , he was stunned to come across two ' 1s ' - both of which were worth $ 250,000			1
he later uncovered another ' 1 ' ( $ 75 ) and two further ' 2s ' ( $ 500 and $ 50 respectively )			0
above , mr wines with the ticket misprint : as he started scratching , he came across two ' 1s ' ( pictured ) - both worth $ 250,000			1
however , he was later told they had been misprinted - and were , in fact , double - figure numbers that were not winners assuming that the scratcher 's stated maximum prize of $ 250,000 was wrong , a delighted mr @entity8 returned to the gas station to collect his winnings			1
however , he was told he had not won anything			0
instead , the female cashier explained that the ' winning ' numbers were , in fact , double - figure numbers that had seen their right - hand - side numbers omitted as a result of a misprint by the lottery			2
' i took it back in and she told me that is not a winner , ' mr @entity43 told @entity48			0
' they told me that it was a misprint and they do n't pay off for misprints			0
' indeed , if you look closely at mr @entity8 's ticket , you can see part of several numbers that are supposed to be next to the 1s and 2s			1
however , it is unclear what figures they are meant to be			0
more false wins : mr @entity8 later uncovered another ' 1 ' ( worth $ 75 ) and two further ' 2s ' ( worth $ 500 and $ 50 respectively ) - two of which are pictured above - that were also revealed to be the result of a lottery misprint unhappy customer : ' i mean , if you thought you won $ 500,000 and somebody tells you that you did n't , and you can prove you did , it 's pretty stressful for somebody to say , " no you 're not getting your money " , ' said mr @entity8 furthermore , the letters underneath the 1s and 2s - which are a safety figure designed to prevent fraud by responding to specific numbers ( such as 14 = ' @entity78 ' ) - clearly refer to other numbers			1
but despite the evidence , mr @entity80 claims the ticket appears to be a winner , saying : ' there ’s a 1 right here for $ 250,000 , ” said @entity43			2
“ @entity86 below that is another 1 and it 's a $ 250,000 winner			2
' he added : ' i mean , if you thought you won $ 500,000 and somebody tells you that you did n't , and you can prove you did , it 's pretty stressful for somebody to say , " no you 're not getting your money "			2
' seller : following the gas station 's ( pictured ) refusal to pay him any cash mr @entity80 contacted the @entity9			2
but they told him in an email that his ticket was ' not a winner ' and refused to honor his ' winnings ' following the gas station 's refusal to pay him his winnings , mr @entity80 contacted the @entity9			1
however , the firm apparently told him in an email that his ticket was certainly ' not a winner '			0
as a goodwill gesture , officials offered him $ 100 in lottery tickets , according to the broadcaster			1
but an angry mr @entity80 said : ' this is $ 500,000			0
that 's a half million			0
it ’s like i told them , i did n't misprint it			0
i bought the ticket in good faith thinking if i won i was going to get my money			0

@entity8 bought @entity18 from @entity12 gas station
ticket has winning numbers ' 1 ' and ' 2 ' , with a maximum prize of $ 250,000
but mr @entity8 found three ' 1s ' and two ' 2s ' - worth over $ 500,000 in total
however , when he went back to the *garage* , he was told it was a misprint
lottery *confirmed* figures on right of ' 1s ' and ' 2s ' had n't printed properly
officials refused to honor mr @entity8 's ' win ' , but offered him $ 100 in tickets
