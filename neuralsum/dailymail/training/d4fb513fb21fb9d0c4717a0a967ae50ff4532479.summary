by @entity0 @entity2 owner @entity1 apologized thursday to @entity4 's family over his choice of words in a videotaped interview in which he addressed bigotry and prejudice			1
@entity1 even revealed some of his own prejudices in the interview with @entity13 , and said he believes everyone has ' prejudices and bigotries ' on some level			2
but after his words - which came with the @entity19 still dealing with the fallout over racist remarks made by now - banned @entity23 owner @entity22 - created a stir in social media and other circles , @entity1 took to @entity27 to offer his apology			1
' i did n't consider the @entity4 family , and i apologize to them for that			2
' ' beyond apologizing to the @entity4 family , i stand by the words and the substance of the interview , ' @entity1 wrote			1
@entity4 was the black @entity48 teen who was shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer @entity49 in february 2012			2
@entity4 was wearing a hooded sweatshirt - commonly called a ' hoodie ' - that night , and that particular piece of clothing became a rallying cry for those who demanded justice			2
earlier in the day , billionaire @entity2 owner @entity1 faced huge criticism after admitting that he would cross the street if he saw ' a black kid in a hoodie '			1
@entity1 made the remarks as he spoke about bigotry after he was asked at a business conference to address the controversy over banned @entity23 owner @entity22			1
division : @entity4 was killed on february 26 , 2012 , as he passed through the gated , @entity70 , @entity48 , community where @entity49 lived and served as a watch volunteer in the interview , which was shown on wednesday at the @entity75 convention hosted by @entity13 , he said that overcoming bigotry requires acknowledging internal prejudices			1
' i know i 'm prejudiced and i know i 'm bigoted in a lot of different ways , ' he said			0
' if i see a black kid in a hoodie and it 's late at night , i 'm walking to the other side of the street			1
and if on that side of the street , there â€™s a guy that has tattoos all over his face - white guy , bald head , tattoos everywhere - i 'm walking back to the other side of the street			1
' ' the list goes on - of stereotypes that we all live up to and that we 're fearful of , ' he continued			0
' i know that i 'm not perfect			0
while we all have our prejudices and bigotries , we have to learn that it 's an issue that we have to control , that it 's part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it , not just to kick the problem down the road			2
' after the interview was shared online , @entity1 was lambasted for his comments			1
accusations : after reports of the interview emerged , some @entity27 users branded @entity1 ' racist ' response : @entity1 tweeted back to his critics , saying that he was simply being honest about his failings backup : other @entity27 users jumped to @entity1 's defense , saying he was simply stating the way things are critics said his ' hoodie ' reference recalled the 2012 shooting of unarmed , black @entity48 teenager @entity4 , who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was fatally wounded in a struggle with a man who said he feared for his life			1
@entity1 defended his views on @entity27 , saying that his quotes were not meant to advocate racism			0
@entity1 ' the point was that before we can help others deal w racism we have to be honest about ourselves , ' @entity1 wrote in a tweet			0
' you 're trying to make this about a hoodie , ' he said to another tweeter			0
' you know damn well its not [ sic ]			0
it 's about whatever makes you feel threatened			0

outspoken : @entity1 , pictured left with his daughter @entity159 and wife @entity160 , and right celebrating a @entity2 win with daughters @entity159 ( left ) and @entity165 , has owned the team since 2000 opinion : he made the comments while talking about bigotry after he was asked about @entity22 , who could be forced to give up the @entity23 after he was recorded making racist remarks but he initially opposed calls to ban him from the @entity19 , saying it would be a ' very slippery slope ' if the league forced an owner to sell the team			1
' in no uncertain terms am i supporting what @entity22 said , or his position , ' @entity1 said			2
' he 's obviously racist , he 's obviously bigoted			0
and in this day and age when you 're in the public eye you 've got to be damn careful - if that 's your position and that 's unfortunately where you 're at - you better be damn careful what you say , even in the privacy of your own home			0
' but regardless of your background , regardless of the history they have , if we 're taking something somebody said in their home and we 're trying to turn it into something that leads to you being forced to divest property in any way , shape or form , that 's not the @entity203			0
i do n't want to be part of that			0
