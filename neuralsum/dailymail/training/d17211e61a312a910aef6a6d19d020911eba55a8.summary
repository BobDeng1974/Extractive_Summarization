skiers are being invited to add a bit of luxury to their trips to the slopes by opting for a helicopter transfer from airport to their resort			1
@entity8 has launched a new helicopter service , offering exclusive fixed pricing on private helicopter transfers to popular @entity13 ski resorts that starts from just £ 185 each way per person			1
the private jet booking service says the service has been launched to reflect increasing demand for shorter ski breaks and shorter booking lead times – and offers market - leading prices and service			1
the helicopter transfers will whisk skiers to the slopes form the airport from £ 185 it is available to those who want to book a helicopter flight only , in addition to the company 's private jet clients			1
@entity34 , ceo of @entity8 , comments : ' with the popularity of short ski breaks on the rise , it 's never been more of a priority to maximise time on the slopes – and minimise the time to get there			1
' our existing private jet clients know how many hours can be saved by landing as close as possible to the resort , by using smaller airports			2
helicopter transfers make the journey even faster , and can be combined with a private jet flight or an airline flight			1
' for example a helicopter transfer from @entity52 to @entity53 takes just 25 minutes , compared to a drive time of between two and three hours – even longer in busy traffic			2
for a return journey this can gain an extra half day on the slopes			0
' we are seeing more clients booking ski breaks at short notice and our private charter helicopter service is fast , transparent and easy to arrange			1
we have secured preferred fixed rates with local helicopter operators , so there is no waiting around for a quote			2
with the price of renting a car being as much as £ 600 a week at some ski resorts , taking the helicopter works out as the cheaper option taking a helicopter from airport to ski resort is perfect if families are on a short - time trip ' of course the luxury of a helicopter transfer can add considerably to the enjoyment of a ski trip , but it is the compelling time - saving benefits that attract many customers			1
' the new service offers helicopter flights from 14 airports in @entity88 and @entity89 , directly into popular ski resorts , such as @entity91 , @entity53 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
there is a choice of helicopter type - from a single engine @entity97 ( seats five or six ) to a @entity101 twin engine helicopter , which offers a faster journey ; spacious vip club seating for 6 people ; and a bigger luggage capacity			2
several of the helicopter models also offer additional secure storage for skis underneath the aircraft			0
the idea of taking a helicopter ahead of the road is hoping to take off in @entity113 too			0
airport shuttle service @entity114 are chartering flights from @entity117 to both @entity118 and @entity119 from just $ 99 ( £ 65 )			2
taking the helicopter in @entity113 will ease the stresses of airport travel what 's more it will give you plenty of time to make your flight - the expected journey time is cut from two hours by road to just six minutes			1
and the cost is equivalent to that of a black cab			0
the special $ 99 fare applies to first - time flyers however , thereafter it will range from $ 199 - $ 219			0
@entity8 says its prices are fixed and instant , unlike other helicopter companies , whose prices can vary on the same route , and who can take hours to quote			1
prices per person start from £ 185 ( € 243 ) for a one - way flight from @entity144 to @entity53 , based on a group of six travelling together in a @entity97 ( € 1460 for the whole aircraft )			1
the helicopter option may not seem so exclusive after all as travellers heading for the piste this half - term face a barrage of extra costs at the car rental desk meaning they could end up paying over two times as much as they had originally budgeted for			2
@entity156 , the leading provider of stand - alone car hire excess insurance , researched seven @entity13 ski gateways to see how a traveller ’s costs snowballed on picking up their hire car			0
hiring a car for the week across the seven locations of @entity165 , @entity52 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 costs on average £ 214			0
however once ' extras ' , paid for at the rental desk , are factored in a traveller could be looking at an average final bill in the region of £ 600			0
@entity165 is the most expensive place to hire a car to go skiing			0
it costs on average £ 313 to hire a car , plus on average £ 486 for the extras			0
@entity181 is the most reasonable place to hire a car to go skiing , with rental costs averaging about £ 130 and extras at £ 202			0
extras include an average cost of £ 96 for a week ’s car hire excess insurance or waiver , £ 25 for a tyre and windscreen excess policy , £ 50 for an extra driver ( £ 122 if they ’re under 25 yrs ) , hiring a sat nav costing £ 75 , payment for winter tyres costing £ 48 , a roof rack ( for skis ) costing £ 34 and a child ’s car seat for £ 51 - a grand total of £ 379 extra paid to the rental company .			0
