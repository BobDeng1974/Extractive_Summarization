@entity1 president @entity0 said on monday that @entity2 should commit to a verifiable freeze of at least 10 years on its nuclear activity for a landmark atomic deal to be reached , but said the odds were still against sealing a final agreement			1
in an interview with @entity9 at the @entity10 , @entity0 said that a rift over @entity14 prime minister @entity13 's planned speech to @entity15 opposing the @entity2 deal on tuesday was a distraction that would not be ' permanently destructive ' to @entity1 @entity14 ties			1
but he said there was a ' substantial disagreement ' between his administration and the @entity14 government over how to achieve their shared goal of preventing @entity2 from acquiring nuclear weapons			1
he said @entity2 must halt their nuclear work earlier on monday in a speech on monday to the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) @entity13 warned that a nuclear deal could threaten @entity14 's survival ' if , in fact , @entity2 is willing to agree to double - digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and , in fact , rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we 've got that , and we 've got a way of verifying that , there 's no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they do n't have a nuclear weapon , ' he said			1
the @entity1 goal is to make sure ' there 's at least a year between us seeing them try to get a nuclear weapon and them actually being able to obtain one , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity14 fears that @entity0 's @entity2 diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb			1
@entity65 denies it is seeking nuclear weapons			0
@entity13 has spoken scathingly about a possible deal , saying negotiators appear to have given up on a pledge to prevent @entity2 from acquiring nuclear weapons			1
he says a nuclear - armed @entity2 would pose an existential threat to the jewish state			0
@entity0 sought to downplay the long - term damage from the row over @entity13 's speech to @entity15 , saying the rift was not personal and that he would meet the @entity14 leader again if he wins @entity14 's march 17 election			1
' this is not a personal issue			0
i think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the @entity1 to recognize that the @entity1 has a process of making policy , ' @entity0 said			0
but @entity0 said @entity13 had been wrong before with his opposition to a 2013 interim deal with @entity2			1
@entity14 fears that @entity0 's @entity2 diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb ' @entity13 made all sorts of claims			1
this was going to be a terrible deal			0
this was going to result in @entity2 getting 50 billion dollars worth of relief			0
@entity2 would not abide by the agreement			0
none of that has come true			0
' it has turned out that in fact , during this period we 've seen @entity2 not advance its program			0
in many ways , it 's rolled back elements of its program			0
' the @entity10 last week denied a report that the @entity1 and @entity2 were exploring a possible 10 - year deal that would initially freeze @entity2 's nuclear program but gradually allow it to increase activities that could enable it to produce nuclear arms in the last years of the agreement			2
in a speech on monday to the @entity118 ( @entity33 ) , the largest @entity1 pro-israel lobby , @entity13 again warned that a nuclear deal could threaten @entity14 's survival while insisting the @entity1 - @entity14 relationship was ' stronger than ever			1
' asked about the prospects for a final deal with @entity2 , which has a june 30 deadline , @entity0 said that a key doubt was whether @entity2 would agree to rigorous inspection demands and the low levels of uranium enrichment capability they would have to maintain			2
' but if they do agree to it , it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take , any military action @entity14 could take and far more effective than sanctions will be , ' @entity0 said			2
a comprehensive nuclear deal is seen as crucial to reducing the risk of a wider @entity142 war , at a time when @entity2 is deeply involved in conflicts in @entity145 and @entity146 .			2
