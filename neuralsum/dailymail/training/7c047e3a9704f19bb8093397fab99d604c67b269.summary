as a 30 - year veteran of @entity2 , you would have thought @entity3 had seen everything			1
but perhaps nothing quite like this ... yesterday the unflappable broadcaster seemed mesmerised by the enthusiastic twerking of @entity9 model @entity8 as he started his unlikely stint on @entity11			1
@entity12 , 29 , was trying to teach @entity3 some moves after enjoying a cocktail in the @entity16 hotel where the celebrities stayed before they headed to the jungle			1
@entity2 broadcaster , 68 , starts off his unlikely stint on @entity11 in @entity16 and seems mesmerised as he watches @entity9 model @entity8 , 29 , show him some of her moves she said : ‘ we should do some shots and get this party going			1
let ’s twerk or something – pick up your pants @entity30 to loosen them			2
’ after witnessing the demonstration , @entity3 says : ‘ oh right , it ’s a bit similar to belly dancing			1
’ @entity8 replies : ‘ yes but with your a * * * ! ’ the journalist had raised eyebrows by agreeing to go on the @entity39 reality show , but said : ‘ there ’s a tendency to think very highly of one ’s self and get terribly stuck up on these things , so all of my family has agreed it ’s time i loosen up a bit			1
’ ‘ this is an ideal opportunity to do that , i suppose			2
it ’s not my normal cup of tea , but who knows ? i might be converted to it			2
it ’s definitely a new world			2
but come on , it ’s like being an explorer , is n’t it ? ’ it was in that adventurous spirit he also tried something no 68 - year - old white @entity66 presenter probably should – a hip - hop style handshake			1
@entity69 - born rapper @entity68 ( left ) shows the presenter ( right ) how to pull off a hip - hop style greeting @entity68 , the 28 - year - old @entity69 - born rapper , showed the broadcaster how to pull off the complex greeting			1
the hotel offered the last taste of luxury before the celebrities headed into the @entity81 rainforest for the start of the series tonight			1
already one of the participants has found it to be an emotional experience			2
the normally bubbly @entity88 from @entity89 was so unnerved by the helicopter flight to base camp that she burst into tears , causing her carefully applied make - up to stream down her face			1
@entity95 , 33 , looked terrified even before she stepped aboard and spent the rest of the flight with her hands over her eyes			0
at one point , she pleaded with he pilot : ‘ can you stop a minute please			0
i ’m serious , just stop			0
i need to get out , seriously i ’m going to be sick , i ca n’t do it , no way			0
’ her emotions wrecked her plan to make a glamorous arrival in the jungle			0
just hours before take - off she told journalists : ‘ i ’ve already booked a blow - dry before i go into the jungle			1
i ’ve had my nails done and i ’m off for a spray tan this evening			0
' i ’ve had a full set of @entity116 eyelashes put in before i go in there			0
’ also taking part in the series are @entity121 star @entity120 , @entity123 actress @entity122 and tv presenter @entity124			2
former minister @entity125 is also expected to enter the competition at a later date			0
mr @entity3 , the presenter of @entity66 ’s @entity128 , admitted he had probably made a mistake by not embarking on a fitness routine before his arrival			1
he said : ‘ i have been in denial			0
i did n’t prepare at all , which was probably a dreadful mistake			0
’ he flew down under as the pop stars who were inspired to record the original @entity136 charity single by his news reports from @entity138 in 1984 reunited in @entity139			0
they were joined by a new generation of pop stars to record a new version of do they know it ’s @entity146 ? to raise money to combat @entity148 .			0
