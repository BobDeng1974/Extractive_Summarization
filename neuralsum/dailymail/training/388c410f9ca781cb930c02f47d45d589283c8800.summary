once again @entity0 proved a major pain in @entity3 's neck			1
four years ago @entity4 , managed by the @entity5 , produced one of their most abject @entity8 performances in recent memory against the @entity11 nation in @entity12			0
and on thursday night , @entity0 frustrated @entity3 yet again by ending @entity14 's @entity8 participation in @entity15 in a pulsating 1 - 1 draw			1
progressing into the knockout stages was easier said than done , though			0
@entity0 needed just a point to progress through to the second round for the first time in their history			2
for @entity14 on the other hand , it was win or bust			2
only victory would see @entity3 's men leapfrog last night 's opponents into second place			2
the @entity5 manager was under immense pressure to drop @entity104 football 's poster boy @entity35 for @entity105 up front ahead of last night 's clash			2
@entity3 bowed to public pressure as @entity105 took his place the starting line - up , but @entity35 also kept his shirt			1
and the underfire striker repaid his manager 's faith in the sixth minute by giving @entity14 an early lead			1
colourful : @entity0 fans celebrate after @entity0 's @entity22 scored the equaliser pressure point : @entity120 coach @entity119 ( above ) and @entity14 boss @entity3 ( below ) write caption here @entity120 delight at maiden knockout spot @entity124 vs @entity125 @entity126 vs @entity127 @entity129 vs @entity128 @entity130 vs @entity131 @entity132 vs @entity133 @entity78 vs @entity0 @entity134 vs @entity135 @entity136 vs @entity137 the @entity138 forward planted an unstoppable header , after escaping @entity141 's attentions , from @entity32 's outswinging cross past @entity47			1
the 23 - year - old held his finger to his mouth as he celebrated , perhaps a response to critics back in his homeland			0
on the touchline , @entity3 was more concerned about building on his side 's dream start as the @entity104 threatened to increase their lead inside the opening 25 minutes			2
@entity29 's could n't quite pull the trigger following a dangerous run through the heart of @entity0 's back four , while @entity32 watched a wicked long range effort fly narrowly wide of @entity47 's goal			2
slowly but surely , though , the @entity160 's dusted off their early cobwebs , with the impressive @entity55 leading his nation 's charge			0
and @entity119 's side went within inches from equalising in the 29th minute when @entity22 saw his header from @entity55 's corner brilliantly tipped over the bar by @entity23			1
three minutes from half - time the pair combined again for almost a carbon copy of the earlier chance , but @entity22 again saw his header saved			1
perfect start : @entity35 scores the opening goal for @entity14 against @entity0 lip service : @entity35 celebrates scoring for @entity14 against @entity0 and the @entity160 were nearly punished for their missed chances just two minutes into the second half when @entity47 produced an excellent point blank save from @entity28 after an incisive one - two with @entity35			1
the importance of @entity47 's was amplified on the hour when the @entity160 's notched their decisive leveller			0
the @entity55 / @entity58 combination had already caused @entity14 problems in the first half - but @entity3 's side did n't learn their lesson			1
this time @entity22 's header from @entity55 's free - kick beat @entity23 to put the @entity160 's back on course for the knockout stages			1
@entity0 's fanatical supporters went mad , as did the players as the importance of @entity22 's goal took hold of the @entity11 side			1
delight : @entity0 's substitutes run onto the pitch at the final whistle memorable : @entity160 players celebrate reaching the last 16 for the first time flying the flag : @entity0 's @entity141 carries a team - mate on his shoulders @entity57 saw his long - range effort comfortably saved moments later as @entity0 went for the jugular			1
@entity34 threatened to spoil the @entity160 party in the 70th minute , but saw his low shot saved by the excellent @entity47			0
and @entity160 boss @entity119 made the surprising decision to take off @entity55 , his side 's most potent attacking threat , with 20 minutes left to play			0
it was a clear statement of intent from @entity119 as he looked to protect his side 's vital point			0
likewise , @entity3 knew it was now or never as he urged his side on in search of a decisive second			0
but for all their late pressure , the @entity104 's struggled to carve out an opportunity that could save their @entity8 as @entity160 kept the wolves from their door			0
@entity3 cut a frustrated figure in his technical area , while @entity119 tried his best to keep cool as the @entity104 threw the kitchen sink at his side			0
the @entity160 manager was n't as cool , however , as the referee blew the final whistle to book his side 's place in the knockout stages .			0

@entity35 had given @entity14 a sixth - minute lead
@entity22 equalised with second - half header
@entity0 through to last 16 for the first time
@entity3 denied last - 16 meeting with @entity78
