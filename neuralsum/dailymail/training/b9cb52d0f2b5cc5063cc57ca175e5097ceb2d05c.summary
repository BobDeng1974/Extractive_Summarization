' i lost my bearings ' : @entity2 , whose snow plough clipped the wheel of a private jet taking off in @entity6 on monday , causing it to crash the driver of the snowplough in the @entity6 plane crash which killed @entity13 oilman @entity12 and three crew has admitted straying onto the runway after losing his bearings			1
@entity2 's lawyer also acknowledged the 60 - year - old may have consumed a ' remedy ' which included ' a few drops ' of alcohol after yesterday angrily denying official claims his client was ' drunk '			1
in video testimony , the grey haired driver stated : ' when i lost my bearings , i myself did n't notice when i drove onto the runway			2
' mr @entity12 , the 63 - year - old boss of @entity13 oil giant @entity27 , was killed alongside the three crew of his @entity30 business jet when the aircraft exploded into a fireball at @entity33			1
it was also revealed today that a ' girl trainee ' air traffic controller gave the signal to the doomed business jet that it was clear to take off - moments before it hit @entity2 's snowplough			1
the unnamed controller was being supervised at the time by a senior colleague called @entity45 , said a source at @entity33			2
@entity45 , 40 , is an experienced air traffic controller who famously averted a serious crash in 2007 by halting a @entity51 takeoff when he noticed flames coming from the plane			1
the revelations came amid suspicions of an official campaign to gag @entity58 's lawyer and family - who deny he was ' drunk ' at the time of the crash - from highlighting alleged blunders by airport controllers			1
in particular , his lawyer argued that the controller should have seen that his vehicle was on the runway when the @entity30 was permitted to start its takeoff , but other disturbing claims have also come to light			1
@entity2 is expected to face a @entity6 court today when a judge will be asked to approve his formal arrest			1
' the plane was running up to takeoff and i practically could n't see it because my equipment was on			2
there were n't even any lights , nothing , ' he said , with a shrug			2
' i did n't see it , and the collision happened			2
' it was not clear if he meant the lights on the runway or the plane or on his vehicle			2
the crash was at several minutes before midnight on monday			1
a report by newspaper @entity94 appeared to confirm speculation that an inexperienced air traffic controller was involved			2
' the aircraft 's actions were really run by girl trainee , ' said a source at @entity33			1
' the instructor actually controls all the actions of the trainee , ' and can intervene at any time			2
' in addition , there is also a flight director who supervises the work of air traffic controllers , ' said the unnamed source			0
' however , in the case of the @entity30 crashed at @entity33 air traffic controllers were not able to do anything			0
' another insider said : ' no one could see the vehicle			0
' but this source complained the ' quality of display equipment ' was ' very poor '			0
' as a result , when the vehicle moved out onto the runway unauthorised , it was not seen			0
' the snowplough driver was supposed to listen to radio communications between the tower and plane and ' had to hear ' if a plane was given the go - ahead to takeoff , it was claimed			1
fellow workers at @entity33 have disputed the claim @entity2 was drunk , but there was a suggestion today that he consumed ' coffee with liquor ' shortly before the crash			1
investigators warned that senior officials at the airport bore ultimate responsibility for errors by ground staff , arguing ' criminal negligence ' was involved			0
@entity146 , right , with his wife : mr @entity12 , ceo of @entity27 , was returning to @entity148 after meeting @entity150 prime minister @entity149 in @entity6			0
he and three crew members were killed in the crash experts were today obtaining information from the plane 's black boxes			1
' the information extracted from cockpit voice recorder will be sent for transcription and voice identification			0
the data from flight data recorder will be deciphered and submitted to technical experts , ' said @entity164 , deputy chairman of the @entity6 - based @entity165 ( @entity165 )			1
meanwhile , lawyers for @entity2 claimed that their attempts to hold a press conference have been stonewalled by a number of @entity171 media organisations			1
a report by @entity173 said : ' a news conference by @entity58 's lawyer and his wife and son was scheduled to take place at the offices of the @entity180 i fakty weekly			1
' however , it was cancelled for technical reasons without any details given , says @entity186 [ business daily ]			0
' no agreement could be reached with @entity188 [ daily ] either , the lawyer representing the snowplough driver told @entity191			1
' requests were sent to a couple of other places : at first they agreed , but then called back and refused			0
' wreckage : the remnants of mr @entity12 's @entity196			1
investigators warned that senior officials at the airport bore ultimate responsibility for errors by ground staff , arguing ' criminal negligence ' was involved @entity204 , @entity2 's lawyer , later told the station he has not been given the name of the air - traffic controller on duty			1
he also claimed that he was denied access to his client soon after the crash			1
he fears that in the 20 hours @entity2 spent in custody alone he was forced to sign documents without his lawyer present			1
' i realise that right now we are in situation of conflict of interest between the airport and the driver , because if the investigation finds out that the fault was on the airport 's air traffic controller , there is the prospect of millions worth of legal actions , ' he said			2
' my client is a very convenient figure from this point of view			2
if he is found guilty the threat of legal actions and losses is far smaller			0
we understand we will be fighting company with huge administrative and financial resources			0
' he claimed a subtle change has been made in the name of the company employing @entity2 in a possible bid to distance it from the airport			1
until yesterday it was called called @entity246 ' @entity245 '			0
today it is known as @entity249 ' @entity248 '			2
the first is a closed joint stock company , the second is a public corporation			0
' on other strange moments in this investigation , we still do n't have name of chief engineer whose duty was to look after snow ploughing brigade , ' he said			0
' @entity2 is just an ordinary driver , he had no access to overall picture of what 's been happening at the airport at that point			1
' ' he is in a state of shock , even though visually there is not a single scratch on him			0
i have requested medical check up to see if he might have brain concussion or internal damages			0
' he ca n't put together his actions with what happened ... ' i do n't understand what happened , i was following my route ' , he keeps saying			0
' mr @entity204 earlier told @entity278 newspaper : ' we still have not seen the documents on the medical examination of @entity2			1
' i can imagine that they do not exist			0
probably , the investigators could conclude that there was ' intoxication ' , based on @entity2 's diction and behaviour and reported it to their superiors			1
' but the man was in shock			0
' @entity204 , @entity2 's lawyer : he said he believes there was no medical carried out on his client that could definitively prove he was drunk mr @entity204 added : ' @entity2 is a simple man			1
he is the most basic technical performer			0
he has no understanding of what is happening in the air and on the ground			0
' even if we assume that @entity2 was lost in the fog , he did not go there of his own initiative			1
' he was sent by people who should have known that the @entity30 was preparing for take - off			2
' there are internal rules , according to which the air traffic controller has full responsibility for everything that happens in the air and on the ground			0
' even if we assume that @entity2 lost landmarks as a result of weather conditions , it is the dispatcher who had to control him , direct his routes			1
' @entity2 's son , @entity320 , said : ' my father never complained			1
he does not do any dirty tricks			0
just worked honestly , and that 's all			2
' he served in the army , worked as a driver , a crane operator			0
for a while , he led a garage cooperative			0
and this work in @entity33 - in fact he was paid very little there			2
' but it was important to him - to do something , to work			2
just not to sit at home			0
he and my mother still do not want to retire			0
' respected political analyst and editor @entity339 said today that the crash could signal the ' beginning of collapse ' for @entity344 's system of government			1
' how could it happen that a snowplough was on the runway ? how could it happen that the plane was allowed to go along the runway and hit this snowplough ? it is very symbolic , ' she said			0
such ' chaos ' will stop business from coming to @entity150 , she warned			0
' they ca n't get rid of the chaos here			0
' it is such a symbolic thing that i strongly feel it is the beginning of collapse			2

@entity2 's lawyer also says his client may have drunk ' remedy '
@entity2 to appear before court today so judge can approve arrest
lawyer claims his client may be lined up as a *scapegoat* for the *accident*
it is claimed @entity380 - linked media have blocked family press conference
political analyst says crash could signal ' collapse ' of @entity344 's government
