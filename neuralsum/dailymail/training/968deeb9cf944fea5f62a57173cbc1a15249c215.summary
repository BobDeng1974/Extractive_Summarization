by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 16:58 est , 31 july 2013 defying mummy : @entity2 loves running around without her sun hat we 're in @entity7 on holiday for a week and for the first time in a million years of ' staycationing ' here , the weather is actually on our side			1
tagging along is a friend who does n’t have children but has foolishly agreed to come with us			1
our family routine baffles her			1
why , she asks me on day three , does it take two adults and four children several hours to leave the holiday house ? i have no answer			1
whole species could crawl out of the sea , evolve and then become extinct in the time it takes for us to pack for the beach			1
i do n't understand the delay because i start the exit countdown while everyone is still in their pjs			1
i even turn off the telly			1
no one moves except the toddler who inexplicably asks : ' what is @entity35 ? ' while i cram everything into a bag , mr @entity36 finds the buckets and spades			1
my friend packs her book			1
' you wo n’t need that , ' i say			2
' no one with children under ten takes a book to the beach			1
' the toddler is the only child who has started to get ready			2
she 's naked and running round shouting ' bitch ! bitch ! ' no matter how many times we correct her she still ca n't say ' beach '			1
' get dressed now , ' i instruct the other three who are still lying on the sofa			2
my friend is standing by the door reading her book			2
finally , when we are all ready , mr @entity36 decides to disappear to the loo			2
' we leave without him , ' i command , the captain abandoning one of the troops			1
model family : @entity0 wishes she could get a perfectly posed holiday shot like her @entity67 friends outside the toddler is lying star - shaped , face - down and howling			1
she ca n't find her purple shoe			2
' we ca n’t leave without her though , can we ? ' my friend asks , confused by family etiquette and looking at her watch			1
' nope , ' i reply before instructing the eldest to get the two - year - old 's shoe out of the pan cupboard where she hides things			2
make a splash experts say three is the best age to start teaching children to swim - any younger and they struggle to take instructions at last we all leave			1
it 's midday by now , and we 're on the way to the seaside in blazing sun. @entity2 removes her hat three times before we leave the garden			1
i lumber up the path after her struggling with my enormous bag , like a @entity96 donkey saddled with an overweight tourist			2
by this point the tide has come in and gone out			2
i 'm dripping with sweat and about as patient as @entity102			2
' put that hat back on now , @entity2 , ' i plead through gritted teeth			0
finally i say : ' put it on now or a crocodile will come and eat you			0
' the six - year - old looks behind him nervously and my friend looks shocked			0
' i bet that 's not in the @entity115 book on parenting , ' she mutters			0
' no , ' i concede			0
' but if you can find me a mum who has never used a similar threat in extremis , you can have the first shower when we get back before the kids use up all the hot water			0
' there 's a pause			0
' i have n’t slept properly for ten years , ' i say to no one in particular			0
' something 's got to give			0
' i notice @entity129 - in - the - middle is wearing her home - made t - shirt			0
on the front it says : ' it 's what 's on the inside that matters			0
' on the back she 's written : ' i 'm a monster on the inside			0
' despite the heat , my son has dressed himself in thick jogging bottoms and a long - sleeved shirt			0
he 's also wearing socks			0
my eldest is in a wetsuit , as she refuses to apply sun tan lotion			0
we look like an oddly - dressed circus act on our way to a festival			0
this is when i realise the reason i 'm not one of those mums who can post hundreds of beautiful family pictures on @entity67 is because i 've recklessly encouraged free will among my offspring ! the neighbours sunbathing in their garden try not to stare at my noisy , motley crew			1
their two children are top to toe in @entity166 , sitting on the lawn in their sunhats - a perfect @entity67 family			1
@entity2 throws her hat in the air as high as she can			0
' now the crocodile is coming to eat you , ' she yells defiantly , then runs off giggling wildly			0
and we all collapse with laughter			0
we might be late , but we 're happy			0
@entity0 is editor - in - chief of @entity177 magazine			1
