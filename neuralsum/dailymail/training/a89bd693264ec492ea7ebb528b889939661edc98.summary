mr @entity51 told the hearing that mats were placed at the side of the residents ' beds which would set off an alarm if they fell			2
however , the prosecution says 11 of the mats had been disabled so if the residents had fallen in the night , no alarm would have sounded			1
prosecutor @entity51 told the jury : ' the prosecution case , in a nutshell , is that when they worked together during [ their shifts ] they would disable alarm systems , which would otherwise alert them if one of these elderly residents fell out of their beds			1
@entity7 , pictured left , and @entity6 , pictured , right , both deny 19 charges - one for every resident affected - of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks a capacity , between january 1 and august 19 , 2011 ' they would pad the residents up with extra incontinence pads or place waterproof sheets on the bed so they did n't need to be changed			1

what we have done is inexcusable "			0

' both were dismissed from their jobs that day and were later arrested by police			0
both women denied the allegations when they were quizzed by detectives			0
mr @entity51 said : ' they neglected each and every resident			0
they went to sleep , 11 pressure mat alarms had been disabled so if any of these had fallen in the night they would n't have been found until the defendants decided to wake up			2
