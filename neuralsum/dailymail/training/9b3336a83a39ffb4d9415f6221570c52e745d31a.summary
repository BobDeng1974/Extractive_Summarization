he may be unbeaten this season but @entity2 appeared chastened as he arrived in @entity3 where @entity4 can secure a place in the @entity7 knock - out phase and attempted to explain himself to supporters upset by his stinging words			1
@entity2 confessed he may have gone ' a little bit too far ' by claiming @entity12 was like an ' empty stadium ' after saturday 's win against @entity15 , but he insisted it was only because he cared so much			1
' everybody knows how much i love the club , ' said the @entity4 boss			1
' how much i want it to improve and how much i want to be part of the club in the future			2
even a moment of criticism has to be analysed with different eyes , with the eyes of somebody who knows why i came back to @entity4 and why i 'm here with my heart and why i want to stay for a long , long time			2
@entity4 manager @entity2 admits he may have gone too far criticising the @entity32 ' support the @entity32 boss , pictured at training on tuesday insists the criticism was because he cares so much ' i am just somebody who loves football a lot			1
i am lucky to do my job in the club i like so much and feel such a connection and maybe that makes me lead the club with a different emotion			0
' if i do n't do it in a professional way and concentrate only on training and selection , it is because this is not , for me , just a job			0
it is more than that , because it 's @entity4			1
maybe i go a little bit too far			0
' but i see myself in the stands , watching @entity4 and i want to play , i want to help			2
if i 'm not a player i can not play , if i 'm not a coach i can not make decisions			0
if i 'm just a fan what can i do to help ? that 's just my view			2
' the @entity4 manager was perhaps also feeling tender because he was missing daughter @entity66 's 18th birthday celebrations while in @entity67			1
@entity68 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) scored a goal each to secure three points for @entity4 on saturday @entity2 was unhappy with the crowd as @entity4 fought their way past @entity15 at @entity12 @entity4 currently lead @entity74 and would reach 10 points with a victory against @entity67 on wednesday @entity77 ( right ) and @entity78 applaud the @entity4 fans at the end - but @entity2 was less than happy a single @entity4 fan before the match - but @entity2 claimed the whole match felt like the stadium was empty @entity4 take on @entity67 on wednesday night ' i try to enjoy life but , for example , today is my daughter 's 18th birthday , which is only once in her life and i am here , not with my family , ' said @entity2			1
' i enjoy football and part of the enjoyment is to try always to be better			0
' part of the enjoyment is to play in the best competitions against the best opponents , coaching the best players , the best clubs , never being satisfied			0
if you look through coach 's eyes you can always find things you can improve			2
' especially when people have talent , because i do n't like people to waste their talent			0
if you do n't have talent you have live with what you have			0
but when you have talent – and i have talented players – they must feel there is always space to improve			0
' @entity2 will balance the idea of and resting players against @entity67 - thrashed 6 - 0 in @entity117 two weeks ago - with the desire to win @entity74 quickly			1
his team have a lunchtime date at @entity121 on saturday but he will be conscious of how a young @entity4 team made a meal of beating @entity124 in the @entity125			1
@entity67 boss @entity126 insisted there would be ' no fear ' but it hard to imagine @entity4 failing to top @entity74 from this position			1
they will qualify for the last 16 if they win tonight ( @entity131 ) and @entity132 fail to beat @entity133 in @entity134			0
perhaps with @entity121 's team selection in @entity136 in mind , @entity2 added : ' i like the concept of going with a big club , full of big players , to a city where normally they do n't come			1
i think we have responsibility to play for us and also to play for the people			0
i know they do n't want us to win but to play for the people is to play well , and show what we can do			0
