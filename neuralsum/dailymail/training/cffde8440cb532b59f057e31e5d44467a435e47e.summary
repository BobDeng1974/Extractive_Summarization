after originating in the @entity1 , cake smash parties have been taking the @entity2 by storm as parents look for a fun and memorable way to mark their child 's first birthday			1
the trend involves letting a one - year - old loose with a giant cake while being pictured by a professional photographer , creating some cheeky and adorable shots their mothers and fathers can treasure forever			1
but babies playing with food can inevitably lead to a big mess - which is why the trend has now moved on to include the little ones having a bath after they have smashed a cake			1
