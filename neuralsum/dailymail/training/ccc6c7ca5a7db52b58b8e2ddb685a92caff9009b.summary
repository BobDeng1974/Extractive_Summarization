@entity1 boss @entity0 has told his players to throw caution to the wind and make the most of their attacking talents this season			1
the @entity1 are unbeaten in the league since @entity0 took over at the end of august , and have scored 10 goals in his five games in charge			1
it is a noticeably different approach to that of former boss @entity15 , whose success at @entity18 last season was firmly centred on a strong work ethic and a mean defence			1
@entity21 celebrates his goal during the win over @entity24 at @entity18 last week ' you have a way you want your team to play and you try to remind them of what they can do in certain situations and to not always think defensively , ' @entity0 said			2
' i tell them to be positive in what they do - is the glass half empty or half full ? it 's always half full for me			0
' @entity0 continued : ' i think they can play more attacking			2
it 's about belief , without forgetting their good habits			0
' we have genuine lads who are committed and i think sometimes you have to try get that balance - while you want to be solid , i want to entertain as well if i can			0
' the goals we 've conceded have n't really been down to our opponents ' ability - they 've been down to elementary mistakes , so we 've got to become that compact unit that i know we can be			0
' but i also think we can create more so it 's about having that belief to let ourselves go a bit more in midfield			0
@entity0 ( above ) has told his team to be positive on the pitch and follow their attacking instincts ' ( @entity61 ) @entity60 can score more goals , @entity21 is a bit more free and i think he can get more goals - it 's about them contributing more and not just leaving it to the strikers			1
' after beating both @entity68 and @entity24 , @entity1 are looking for their third straight victory in the @entity71 when they travel to @entity73 on saturday			1
@entity0 named four forwards on the bench for the @entity1 ' 2 - 0 win over the @entity77 last weekend and he says that is symptomatic of the fearlessness he wants his players to show on the pitch			2
@entity1 are unbeaten in the @entity71 since @entity0 took over as manager ' every one of those forwards i 've got at the moment can change the game , whether it 's to win a game , calm us down , provide a spark - they 've all got different attributes and at my age i 'm willing to take that chance , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 've come into it to enjoy myself			0
at this stage of my life and career , that 's what i want to do and i want the players to enjoy it if they can			2
' we know there will be periods when we do n't win for four or five games , but as long as they keep giving me everything i wo n't have a problem			0
