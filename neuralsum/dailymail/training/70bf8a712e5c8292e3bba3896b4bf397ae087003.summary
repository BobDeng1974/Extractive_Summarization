the off - camera drama on @entity1 continues with a new report detailing why executives at @entity4 decided to keep @entity5 on the daytime talk show			1
news of the network 's decision leaked earlier this month before a formal announcement had been made while @entity11 was busy in rehearsal for her role in @entity17 's new play @entity15 , leading to immediate backlash not just from the public , but also @entity11 's good friend and @entity21 co-host @entity22			1
now , @entity11 will stay on the show with a source close to @entity4 executives claiming that the network wants to avoid ' an @entity27 situation			1
the firing of @entity27 from today in 2012 ended up being a disaster for the struggling @entity42 morning news show , with the longtime anchor 's sudden departure and tearful farewell reflecting poorly on the once popular program and its cheerful and positive image			1
@entity4 had reportedly hoped to avoid this by making it seem as if @entity11 was leaving the program because of her commitments to @entity17 's highly anticipated new play , which will begin previews in @entity54 on february 2			2
the news broke however before they could even tell the other co-hosts , and when @entity22 confronted her bosses about what was happening the ' network backpedaled on the plan , ' also concerned about the hit they might take for firing the @entity63 just four months in and having not vetted any other candidates to replace her			1
@entity11 will now return from her month off on february 3			2
@entity11 has been off the past month as she rehearses her role in @entity17 's new play a spokesperson for @entity4 denied these reports , saying ; ' these unnamed sources are wrong			2
as was always the plan , the amazingly talented @entity5 took time off to rehearse for her @entity73 play			0
we ’re eagerly looking forward to having her back on february 3rd			0
any speculation to the contrary is simply untrue			0
' the program continues to struggle in the ratings , and has begun to be outperformed by their @entity80 rival @entity79			0
' it ’s never been such a mess , ' says one insider			0
' nobody knows what ’s going on			0

news broke in *mid-january* that @entity1 would be firing @entity5
@entity11 has been rehearsing role in the *upcoming* @entity90
it is now being reported that the network decided against moving forward with the firing to avoid an ' @entity27 situation '
the firing of @entity27 from today by @entity42 executives *ultimately* reflected poorly on the once popular morning news show
@entity4 executives were also *nervous* to fir the show 's first @entity103 co-host after just four month and had not vetted any possible replacements
