@entity92 opened in 1906 by the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) on the @entity94 , positioned between @entity47 and @entity95			2

the station was taken over by the @entity148 to be used as a command centre for the defence of @entity3			1
not viable : the station was conveniently located for @entity143 ( pictured ) , but did not see a lot of traffic through its doors attractions : @entity8 was also close to the @entity142 ( pictured ) , and @entity45 , but was closed permanently as a station in 1934 because it was too close to @entity157 stops war effort : developers keen to capitalise on the station 's links to @entity2 have previously expressed an interest in transforming it into a tourist attraction it was from here that the gun batteries dotted around @entity3 were coordinated as they tried to shoot down enemy planes during @entity6			1
there are understood to be 32 ghost stations across @entity3 's underground network , abandoned over the years as lines were diverted or the number of passengers passing through dwindled			0
like @entity8 , many of the stations have links to the @entity6			0
down street - last used as a station in may 1932 , became an air raid shelter after the war broke out , and @entity180 was used by thousands of @entity181 during the @entity12			0
the empty station in @entity183 has been used as a location for films including @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and 28 weeks later			0
other abandoned stations still remain at @entity190 , which was on the @entity191 until it closed its doors in 1922 , @entity193 , which was on the @entity194 , and @entity195 , which closed in 1924			0
@entity196 closed in 1932 because it was under - used , while @entity197 is unique in that it is a closed tube station that never actually opened			0
intended to be the deepest station on the underground network , work on @entity197 stopped in 1906 because it was not deemed financially viable			0
@entity2 is believed to have visited the command centre to watch over the command of the battle against the @entity206			1
it was vacated by the @entity148 in the 1950s but seventy years on the @entity35 still owns it to a depth of about 60ft underground			0
the @entity35 ’s jurisdiction ends at a locked gate and beyond this tube trains still run on the @entity94			0
but evidence of the @entity7 's operations centre remains in remarkable condition			1
maps of @entity3 still hang from the walls of the war room			1
the station retains period features including a distinctive brown and green tiling pattern and electrical switch gear			0
the @entity65 , which seeks to turn the city 's disused train stations into leisure or tourist attractions , has bid for the building			1
