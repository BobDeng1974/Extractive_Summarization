' i do n't want to call it destiny , ' says @entity3 , gazing out across the @entity5 skyline from his penthouse suite on the 45th floor of the @entity8			1
' but something tells me the stars are aligning and this is my time			0
' it was a decade ago this week that @entity3 first set foot in @entity5 as an amateur with a dream of one day making his mark on this famous strip of @entity18 desert			1
so excited was the @entity21 - born @entity20 kid that he filled up three disposable cameras with photos of him alongside all the famous boxers he met			2
@entity3 was the guest of his then - trainer @entity25 , the fabled @entity26 , who was in town for @entity30 's fight with @entity31 at the @entity32			1
a lot has changed since then : you 'd never find a disposable camera on the strip these days , @entity30 is currently the mayor of @entity37 and @entity25 passed away aged 68 in 2012			1
@entity3 is hoping to realise his dream of becoming a world champion on his return to @entity5 @entity3 is put through his paces by trainer @entity42 ahead of his showdown with @entity44 for @entity3 these have been 10 years of ups and downs			1
in the ring , he lost his only other world title fight in june of that same year – against @entity50 - and then had to cope with the loss of his mentor just four months later			2
so this trip , to take on @entity44 for the vacant @entity55 middleweight title at an @entity57 some 45 floors beneath his suite , is an emotional one for the 30 - year - old			1
he said : ' being back here brings back a lot of memories			0
@entity63 has a unique feel as a country but you can go away from it for a while but as soon as you touch down it all comes back – the people , the smells , the look of the place			0
' it 's nice to be back			0
it 's almost 10 years to the day since i first came here			1
i was still amateur at the time and @entity25 invited me out to take it all in			2
here i am 10 years later about to fight for my own title – it 's funny how things work			1
' i 'll be honest , when i first started coming here i never really liked it			0
it 's pure capitalism , this is where you come to waste money – very rich people and very poor people			0
but then i started enjoying it , you just ca n't take it too seriously when you 're here			0
they say it 's a playground and you have to try and treat it like that			0
' but he and his trainer @entity42 are both deadly serious when it comes to the threat posed by @entity44			1
@entity101 @entity44 knocks out @entity102 during their @entity5 bout in 2009 @entity3 's former trainer @entity25 ( left ) passed away at the age of 68 in october 2012 the @entity101 was arguably the planet 's finest amateur in his pomp but he is yet to transfer to the paid ranks the dazzling talent shown in the vest and headguard			1
@entity44 is undefeated in 24 fights but , despite being a year older than @entity3 at 31 , is nowhere near as experienced as a professional			1
that could be key , according to the @entity118 southpaw , who has fought and won three times here in @entity5 during the early stages of his career			2
he added : ' i have all the experience for it now			0
i was n't good enough for it before in terms of being a fighter and maybe i needed to learn more			0
if it had happened then maybe it would n't have lasted but now it 's going to happen , i 'm going to win and i 'm a better fighter for it			0
' it 's all coming together at the right time			0
even with the bad experience i had with the @entity134 fight , had i not had that then , i would n't be this well prepared now			0
' @entity3 knocked out @entity63 boxer @entity137 during the fifth round of his last fight in june @entity3 ( left ) has described @entity42 ( right ) as ' hands - down the best trainer in the world ' the majority of the preparation for this fight has been done at another of the world 's famed gambling districts , @entity149 , where @entity42 now lives			1
the man once labelled ' @entity151 ' steered @entity152 to the @entity154 heavyweight title then @entity155 to the brink of world honours			0
@entity3 describes him as ' hands - down the best trainer in the world ' and also explained why @entity5 is to thank for @entity42 's love of boxing			1
' look across there , ' @entity3 says , pointing to a white building some 500m away			2
' @entity164 , where @entity165 and @entity166 fought for the first time in 1981 – and of course @entity25 was @entity165 ' trainer			2
' that was that fight that got @entity42 into boxing , he was taken to the cinema to watch it and that 's where it all started for him			2
now , here he is , with me , one of @entity25 's fighters , about to fight for a world title and we can see the place from our balcony			1
' if that 's not destiny , if you want to call it that , i do n't know what is			0
