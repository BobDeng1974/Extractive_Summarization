by @entity0 a 50 - year inheritance battle over a £ 2million house bought after the sale of a @entity5 hotel ended today after a senior judge ruled it belongs to the daughter of an alleged mistress			1
businessman @entity9 died in 1961 but his child dr @entity10 , 72 , has claimed since then that her family 's rightful inheritance is in the wrong hands			0
she and her sister @entity14 have been at loggerheads with 71 - year - old @entity16 , the current owner of @entity17 , in @entity18 , insisting that she is entitled to a share of the historic house			1
the property , designed by renowned architect , @entity22 , in the 1920s , was bought after a nearby seaside hotel that once belonged to mr @entity9 was sold after his death			0
row : a high court judge found in favour of @entity16 , left , after dr @entity10 , right , lost her legal battle to win a share of a £ 2million @entity31 seaside house bought with proceeds from her father 's hotel beach view : @entity17 , home of @entity16 in @entity18 , @entity31 , which is worth £ 2million @entity10 has argued that mrs @entity16 's mother could not have been her father 's lover as he was impotent , and deserves a share of the house			1
but the ' extraordinary saga ' was today brought to a halt by judge @entity45 , who ruled that she and her sister ' have no beneficial interest whatsoever in @entity17 '			0
it is likely to be the final twist in the battle that has cost dr @entity10 hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees			0
huge legal bill : dr @entity10 , 72 , who has spent 50 years fighting with another pensioner and has now lost her father @entity55 ran and owned a hotel in the town with miss @entity16 ’s mother @entity58 , with whom he was said to be having an affair in the 1950s			1
since his death in 1961 , the pair ’s respective daughters have been at loggerheads over who was due what share of the property			0
the court heard the row has led to a series of alleged incidents including @entity71 being arrested for unfounded fraud allegations , and dr @entity10 ‘ rampaging ’ through the hotel			1
dr @entity10 ’s father and @entity58 had set up a company together to run the @entity76 in @entity18			1
but a year after his death , his share of the hotel was transferred to her , making her the owner			1
she later transferred the ownership to her daughter @entity82 , who sold the @entity76 and bought @entity17 , a 1920s property that was designed by renowned @entity31 architect @entity22 and overlooks @entity85			2
dr @entity10 denied that her father was having an affair and has said that the transfer of his share of the hotel was invalid			1
miss @entity16 , 71 , said dr @entity10 was ‘ in denial ’ and was trying to make her homeless			1
her lawyer , @entity92 , told the court the battle stemmed from dr @entity10 ’s ‘ unsubstantiated suspicions ’ about the administration of her father ’s estate in the early 1960s			2
dr @entity10 said her father , who amassed his wealth through timber and construction firms , remained faithful to her mother , @entity102			2
she claimed he regarded @entity58 as an employee and was planning on ‘ asking her to go ’			0
dr @entity10 , who is married , said he once poured slops into a shoe belonging to @entity58 , and asked : ‘ do you think i ’d want to sleep with a woman like that ? ’ she also claimed that a second will that left her a quarter of his estate went missing			0
rejecting those arguments , however , judge @entity114 , said that , although there was a ' slightly odd ' discrepancy in the shares transfer , there was nothing ' suspicious ' about it			0
the executors had handed the shares to @entity58 ' as part and parcel of an overall bargain ' and after taking professional legal advice , he said			0
dr @entity10 's father with her mother in the 1950s			2
dr @entity10 believes her father was left impotent by tuberculosis and was incapable of having a mistress they had not breached their duties and the transfer was ' for a proper purpose ' bound up with the administration of @entity55 's estate			2
there was no evidence of any ' deliberate concealment ' of evidence by @entity82 and dr @entity10 , who lives near @entity142 , and her sister had in any event launched their court action too late , the judge ruled			0
dr @entity10 had told the court that , during his lifetime , her father had always told her that the @entity76 would be ' her portion ' after his death			2
but mr @entity92 had pleaded with the judge ' to put an end to this extraordinary saga '			0
doing just that , judge @entity114 concluded : ' in the light of my conclusions on the merits , i will make a declaration that dr @entity10 and mrs @entity160 have no beneficial interest whatsoever in @entity17 ' .			1
