if you ’ve ever owned an @entity1 and used @entity2 , but switched to a @entity4 phone , you could be missing out on texts from friends and family			1
once @entity2 is enabled , @entity9 routes messages from other iphones through it			2
however , this can continue even when a number is switched to an @entity15 phone , without access to the service			1
as a result , if anyone sends an @entity2 to that number it does n't get converted to a text , and ultimately ends up lost in the ether			2
but now @entity9 has released a tool that will help people deregister their number from @entity2 , or disable the service , to stop this from happening			1
when a person registers an @entity1 , their number is typically linked to @entity2			1
when they then swap to a new device , these messages are not always converted to text , and become lost			2
the tool ( pictured ) lets previous @entity1 owners enter their phone number to deregister it from the service the tool , first spotted by a @entity38 user , lets current or previous @entity1 owners enter their phone number to deregister it from @entity2			1
they are then sent a six - digit code to confirm they want to remove it			0
alternatively , people who still own an @entity1 and are selling it , or want to simply switch the service off , can click @entity45 , messages and @entity2 off			1
if you still have the @entity1 you were using before you switched , transfer your sim card temporarily back into the @entity50 device			0
make sure the phone is connected to a network			0
click settings , messages and turn @entity2 off			0
if you no longer have the @entity1 , open @entity9 's new tool			1
select the correct country from the drop - down menu and type in the number			0
click ' send code '			0
enter the six - digit code that is sent to that number into the box below , and select @entity63			0
when purchasing an @entity1 , a number is typically linked to the firm ’s @entity66 service upon registration			1
when a message is sent between enabled @entity50 devices , @entity9 sends it as an @entity2 - rather than as a text			2
imessages are sent using a web connection , rather than a network connection			0
but , when a person switches their number to a new phone , such as an @entity15 , that particular number can remain linked to @entity2			1
when an @entity50 user then sends that mobile number a message , @entity9 can end up routing it through its web service			2
but without access to @entity87 , the recipient does n’t receive it unless the sender resends it as a text			0
previously , the only solution was to deregister the old device completely from their @entity9 accounts			2
the bug can also affect @entity95 that have a @entity97 connection and use a number			0
in may , @entity9 said it was addressing bugs within its @entity101 system that caused text messages to become lost when the recipient switched to a @entity4 phone			1
alternatively , people who still own an @entity1 and are selling it , or want to simply switch the service off , can click @entity45 , messages and @entity2 off			1
imessages are sent using a web connection , rather than a network connection			0
but , when a person switches their number to a new phone that number can remain linked but one disgruntled customer was so annoyed about missing messages , she filed a lawsuit against the firm			1
@entity120 claimed the company failed to disclose its knowledge of the problem			0
the issue does not appear to affect all previous @entity1 users , but @entity9 issued a statement that it had ‘ fixed a server - side @entity66 bug which was causing an issue for some users , ’ and was working on an additional fix for future software updates			2
this latest tool offers such a fix .			0

the official @entity9 tool was spotted by a @entity38 user
when a person registers an @entity1 , their number is linked to @entity2
this means that when someone messages from another @entity1 , they receive it as an @entity2 rather than a text
if a person switches their number to a @entity4 phone , it can remain linked
@entity15 phones are not the only phones affected - any @entity4 device could be losing messages if a switch has been made from @entity9
and if they no longer have access to @entity2 , they may not receive posts
@entity9 ’s tool helps people deregister their number from @entity2
it also shows existing @entity1 owners how to disable the service
