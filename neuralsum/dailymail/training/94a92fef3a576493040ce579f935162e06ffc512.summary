by @entity0 for @entity1 mystery man : the man was jailed for a robbery in 1997 , and has since claimed he hails from @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 a foreign national has avoided deportation from @entity11 for more than ten years , by claiming he has forgotten where he is from			1
the 44 - year - old man committed aggravated robbery in @entity16 in 1997 and was jailed for five years , after which he was set to be deported			1
however , while in prison , the man claims to have suffered amnesia and does not know which country he is from – or at least can not make up his mind about it			0
in 1997 , the man was involved in an armed robbery of a jeweller ’s shop in the @entity11 capital , and found guilty alongside at least one other man			1
during the trial , he claimed to be from the @entity30 , his family hailing from @entity7 where he said they lived under threat			2
he was sentenced to five years and immediate deportation for life			0
although he was released from prison after three years , in 2000 , he remained in custody as neither the police or the @entity39 could identify him			0
in a 2002 interview the man claimed his name was @entity43			0
he said he thought he was born in @entity6 to a @entity45 mother and @entity6 stepfather , but his amnesia made him unsure			0
a year later , in 2003 , still being held by police , he told @entity49 : ‘ i just want my freedom , it is my human right			0
' and then i will not stay in @entity11 , i will make my way home to @entity5			2
’ he told the paper he did not remember telling the court he was from @entity7 in 1997 , not did he know how he suffered amnesia			2
@entity60 : @entity11 police have been unable to identify the man or prove his amnesia is fake , and can therefore not deport him ( stock image ) he was released later that year , telling police he was definitely from the @entity30 , and has since been working as an artist in @entity66 , a small town in south - east @entity11			1
as @entity11 police have been unable to identify him , nor prove whether he is telling the truth about suffering amnesia , they are still unable to deport him - and do not know where to send him			1
the 44 - year - old has made several attempts to overturn the ruling to deport him , but they have been denied			1
now , 17 years after his robbery conviction , the @entity11 migration board has applied for the @entity79 to take up the case and affirm the deportation .			0

the 44 - year - old can not be deported as it *'s* not clear where he is from
jailed for aggravated robbery in 1997 , to be deported after serving time
claims to suffer from amnesia , and @entity11 *authorities* can not identify him
since 1997 , he has claimed he is from @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7
