a terrified couple on board the faulty @entity3 jet which made a dramatic emergency landing at @entity5 yesterday have revealed how they sent text messages with their final goodbyes to relatives			1
@entity11 @entity10 and his wife @entity12 sent the messages after cabin crew on board flight @entity16 told them to brace as the plane came into land with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop			1
the couple were on board the @entity25 bound for @entity26 with their three children @entity28 , 16 , @entity29 13 , and four - year - old @entity30			1
the family sent text messages with their final goodbyes to relatives when the @entity3 jet they were travelling on was forced to make an emergency landing at @entity5 yesterday but after the jet took off from @entity5 , it developed a problem with the landing gear , and for several hours , the plane circled the airport and made several low - altitude passes so engineers could inspect the problem			1
and after the passengers were told to brace for an emergency landing , mr @entity10 , 42 , and mrs @entity51 , 40 from @entity52 in @entity53 , the couple were left wondering if they were going to survive			1
mr @entity10 said : ' we text our final goodbyes on the plane to family saying we did n't know if we would survive			1
me and my husband just looked at each other and thought " this is it "			2
' the family had initially planned to go to @entity64 to bring in the @entity65 but when they discovered there were no hotel rooms in the city available , they decided to switch their trip to @entity26 instead , paying £ 6,500			1
the @entity3 jet was forced to make the landing at @entity5 after t developed a problem with the landing gear and touched down with only three quarters of its landing gear down mrs @entity51 said : ' @entity28 had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion			1
this was supposed to be a treat for her			2
' she has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitis			0
and now with this too , we think we must have a guardian angel watching us			0
' we were n't even supposed to be on that flight because we had originally booked to go to @entity64 but had a refund when there were no hotel rooms left			1
' administrator mrs @entity51 and her husband said the holiday had been ' doomed ' from the start after a nearly 10 hour drive from @entity52 to @entity5 to arrive at a hotel which had no gas			1
then an hour into the 11.30am flight yesterday , the pilot announced they would have to turn back to @entity5			1
for several hours , the plane circled @entity5 and made several low - altitude passes so engineers could inspect the problem with the landing gear on landing at @entity5 , mrs @entity51 said passengers cheered for the pilot of landing the @entity25 747 safely she said : ' about 10 minutes later the pilot said we were going to have to dump some fuel			1
we spent about an hour pouring fuel off the wings			0
we did n't know the extent of the problem			0
' they said we would be landing at 1.15pm but it came and went			2
' we started to think something 's not right			0
they started to take pictures under the plane while we were in the air so they could see what the problem was and then they said one of the wheels was stuck			1
' the pilot said they were going to shake the plane to get the wheel down			1
it was the worst feeling you can imagine			0
' he went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out			0
' we knew he was going to do it but it was horrific			0
it did n't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop			0
it was like zero gravity			0
it was like being on the world 's worst roller coaster			0
' people were being sick and people had nosebleeds			0
there were a lot of scared people			0
@entity29 thought she was going to die			0
she was screaming on the plane			2
emergency services were on stand by at @entity5 when the plane came into land after passengers were told to brace for landing ' the shaking did n't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter			1
' we had been on there for quite a long time by this point and people were desperate for the toilet so he levelled it out and the queue was all the way down the aisle			0
' he then told us we were going to do an emergency landing			2
' at this point we were terrified			0
we had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent			2
' they shouted " brace , brace , brace " and then " head down , feet back " over and over again			0
' they thought we were going to go off the runway because the wheel had n't come down so it was harder for them to break			0
' but when we landed it was really smooth , just like any other flight and everybody cheered			1
' the cabin crew and pilot were brilliant			2
i could n't fault them			2
' the family have since been given a complete refund for the flight and were last night put up in the @entity206			2
mrs @entity51 explained : ' they had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us			1
they offered us another plane but we were all traumatised			2
' they 've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now			0
if we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight			1
' we 've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us			0
my dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news			2
the hero pilot who landed the flight was today revealed to be father - of - three @entity232 , pictured , who said he was ' just doing my job ' ' @entity30 slept through most of it			1
she had no idea what was going on when i told her to put her head down			0
then when we got off the plane she said to me " is this @entity26 ? " ' today the hero pilot who safely landed the stricken @entity3 plane was revealed to be 47 - year - old senior pilot @entity232			1
the father - of - three , who has more than 20 years ' flying experience , remained modest about his heroics - but admitted the incident had been ' out of the ordinary '			0
in a brief statement , he said : ' all of our pilots at @entity3 are trained to the highest standards and we go through regular testing to deal with any scenario that may arise			1
' clearly this was an out of the ordinary landing but i was just doing my job and any one of our pilots would have taken the same actions			2
' he added : ' i 'm really proud of my colleagues on the ground and in the air and the support they gave me during this event – everyone worked really hard in a difficult situation and we are delighted that our customers were able to travel to @entity26 the next day for their @entity267 celebrations			1
