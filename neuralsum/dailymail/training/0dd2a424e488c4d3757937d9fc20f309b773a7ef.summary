there are certain traditions over @entity2 and @entity3 that are inevitable - and the trip to the pantomime often tops the list			1
but for some of us who have been to our fair share of festive plays ' she 's behind you ' can start to sound like a broken record			1
so rather than suffer another year of bad jokes and questionable celebrity guests @entity16 has done the legwork and found the best alternative shows			1
from those after a naughtier serving of entertainment to parents looking for a show suitable for all the family , we have got an option for everyone			1
the @entity44 's number one adult pantomime production responsible for @entity46 ! returns this year with its somewhat obscene version of @entity48			0
the somewhat obscene production stars one of @entity52 's most infamous drag queens miss @entity53 the demure sleeping beauty that you are familiar with takes on a gangster persona in this story			1
the ladette and stripper @entity28 , desperate to rid herself of her purity enlists the help of @entity62 in the quest to find the perfect man to ... do the job			0
but despite her best efforts the determined fairy can only conjure up the sexually ambiguous prince @entity69 complete with silver knee high boots			0
@entity28 soon realises she will have to look elsewhere , so the story follows one princess 's quest to pop her cherry while dodging the threats from the infamous drag queen miss @entity53 who is at her best as the foul mouthed @entity78 wreaking havoc across the perverted panto land			1
the production follows the story of a young stripper on a quest to lose her innocence with hilarious results the storyline may not be the strongest to have graced the @entity87 but you are sure not to notice as the side - splitting humour that comes with it is enough of a distraction			1
the small venue creates a cosy atmosphere so makes the perfect arena for audience participation - of which there is plenty - for those of us who are still kids at heart			1
the themes may be tawdry but the performers are all talent and will honestly leave you in the best of moods			0
who knew that a bad taste joke was the key to that festive feeling ? sleeping @entity28 ! runs at the @entity111 theatre until 17 january			1
warning : @entity28 is strictly an over- 18s show @entity114 recreates @entity116 's classic tale of @entity117 in a charming new ballet for an @entity119 : @entity120 scissorhands the ballet rating : verdict : tentative and thoughtful the ballet is one our most genteel @entity2 traditions filled with @entity126 fairies and mouse kings			0
but the dance production of the @entity116 classic @entity117 is a far cry from the @entity131			0
@entity114 first wowed audiences with his production of @entity134 20 years ago when he ruffled feathers with his troupe of all male bare - chested swans			1
fans of the film will notice the few changes to the storyline , particularly the ending in the ballet adaptation it has since seen him reinvent classic ballets including @entity48 , @entity147 and @entity131			0
but for his latest work @entity114 has chosen the ultimate @entity150 fairy tale and the film that cemented director @entity116 ’s career in 1990 , as well as those of its young stars @entity156 and @entity157			0
the @entity159 character , the clunky sharp - fingered @entity161 's awkward movements and clumsy manner are incorporated into a glorious and inventive sequence			2
the tender nature of @entity166 's character complements the style of dance exquisitely those who are familiar with the film will know that @entity161 is n't much of a talker and this marries perfectly with speechless ballet capturing his tender and curious characteristics perfectly			0
there is no shortage of stage magic with @entity161 's knack for hairdressing and topiary recreated entirely seamlessly and convincingly			2
fans of the @entity116 classic will notice some changes to the story with much of the brutal final scene altered and made more ballet - friendly			2
the quirky @entity116 sensibility remains , however , and the set and costumes are perhaps some of the most familiar aspects of the production with the candy - coloured houses and all - american costumes instantly recognisable			2
despite its sombre themes , the production is charming and is sure to leave you feeling surprisingly christmassy			0
@entity117 is showing at @entity198 in @entity199 until 11 january			0
ticket price from £ 27			0
@entity201 follows the story of a clown caught in a snowstorm in a mesmerising production for @entity206 : @entity207 rating : verdict : breathtaking and endless fun if there is one aspect of a panto that is always unavoidable , it is the grumpy dad			1
uncooperative , refusing to engage in any sort of audience participation and murmuring ' oh no you did n't ' as quietly as possible , it is well known that most dads do not share a passion for panto			0
so it really must be a testament to @entity201 that not only is there a sea of smiling men in the audience but a flurry of fathers who are actually willing to join in			1
the show relies mainly on mime while the fantastical set and effects provides the main point of interest the audience unravels giant spider webs ( pictured ) and gets caught in a spectacular snow storm celebrating the 20th anniversary of its @entity44 debut in 1994 , the multi award - winning production follows the tale of @entity242 the clown as he gets caught up in a spectacular snow storm that engulfs the whole stage			1
the style of the show is similar to that of @entity250 in its theatrical quality with the colours , set and music taking on an inventive and wacky charm			0
the storyline is loose and sometimes hard to follow with the cast of clowns relying mainly on mime to communicate the tale , however this is neither here nor there as the conjuring of a paper snow storm on stage is what you really come to see			2
the show which is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its @entity44 debut is designed to appeal to your inner child the performance is in no way confined to the stage and the audience becomes blasted by a blizzard and giant balloons pass through the crowd			1
the producers behind the show wanted to create an immersive experience that transports their viewers back to their childhood and the show does exactly that			0
the textures and colours of the inventive mise - en - scene are so tempting to both older and younger viewers that even the grumpiest of dads are transported back to a younger and more innocent time that is all about having fun and being silly			2
@entity201 is showing at @entity199 's @entity287 until 5 january			1
ticket price £ 20 - £ 65			2
premium tickets are also available			0
recommended for children five years and over and strictly no children under three will be permitted .			2
