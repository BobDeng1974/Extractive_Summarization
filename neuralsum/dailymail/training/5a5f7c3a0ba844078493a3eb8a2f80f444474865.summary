by @entity0 last updated at 1:07 am on 4th august 2011 a @entity2 defence contractor was amongst the targets of the world ’s largest ever cyber attack , thought to have been carried out by @entity6			1
hackers tried to infiltrate the unidentified company to find out sensitive military secrets during an unprecedented five year worldwide campaign , according to a report			2
a total of 72 national governments and well known companies along with bodies such as the @entity16 all fell victim to the operation			2
hacked : the @entity20 building in @entity21			2
the @entity20 was one of 72 organisations infiltrated by the biggest cyber attack in history experts said the most probable culprit was the @entity6 government which has recently been blamed for cyber campaigns against the @entity30 and @entity31			1
the scale of the operation - which covered 14 countries - has stunned @entity36 computer security company @entity35 , which discovered it			1
‘ this is the biggest transfer of wealth in terms of intellectual property in history			2
the scale at which this is occurring is really , really frightening , ’ @entity38 , the security company ’s vice president of threat research said			1
‘ even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators ’			0
@entity35 dubbed the hacking ‘ @entity55 ’ , or remote access tool , referring to a kind of computer software used to infiltrate networks			1
in addition to the @entity2 defence contractor , a computer security company from the @entity2 was also hit but neither have been identified			1
amongst the other victims which have publicly been named are the @entity62 , the @entity20 , the @entity64 news agency and @entity65 , the @entity66 which counts @entity67 amongst its members			0
the @entity36 was hacked the most - 49 times - followed by @entity72 four times and @entity71 three times			0
the data stolen included e-mail archives , design schematics , legal contracts and government secrets			0
long infiltration : in the case of the @entity20 , the hackers broke into the computer system of its secretariat in @entity84 in 2008 , hid there for nearly two years , and quietly combed through reams of secret data @entity35 said the hacking dates back to the middle of 2006 although there may still be intrusions which it has not yet detected			1
the attacks lasted from a matter of weeks to a sustained 28 - month attack against an @entity96 committee of an unidentified @entity98 nation			2
the operation worked by sending an e-mail which when opened downloaded a malicious programme onto an individual ’s computer which allowed an intruder to gain access to their network and remove data			0
@entity35 learned of the operation last march when it gained access to one of the hackers ’ servers and began notifying companies which had been affected and working with them to improve their security systems			1
@entity115 , a cybersecurity expert at the @entity117 , said there was only one country that could be responsible for the attack			0
‘ the most likely candidate is @entity6 , ’ he said			1
‘ who else spies on @entity123 ? ’ @entity6 has long been suspected as being the world ’s leader in cyber espionage			1
mr @entity115 added : ‘ everything points to @entity6			1
it could be the @entity129 , but there is more that points to @entity6 than @entity129 ’			1
there was no comment from @entity6 on the report			1
@entity2 ’s @entity135 , one of the prime targets , was alone the victim of more than 1,000 cyber attacks last year			2
last year , cyber crime cost the @entity2 economy £ 21billion according to one industry report , but it is widely accepted that the figure could be much higher			0
in 2009 , a foreign intelligence agency infiltrated the @entity147 ’s £ 200billion @entity146 project , the @entity36 defence department ’s costliest weapons programme in history			0
cyber spies stole data relating to the aircraft ’s design and electronic system			0
officials said the attacks appeared to originate from @entity6			1
@entity158 , the @entity147 , @entity6 dissidents , and the oil industry has also been hit			2
earlier this year it emerged the @entity30 was the victim of a ‘ very major ’ cyber attack in which it could have lost extremely sensitive data on the finances of dozens of nations			0
mr @entity38 declined to name the companies which were targeted and would only go so far as to blame a ‘ nation state ’ for the operation			2
d ‘ what is happening to all this data … is still largely an open question			0
‘ however , if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation he loss represents a massive economic threat			0
‘ companies and government agencies are getting raped and pillaged every day			0
they are losing economic advantage and national secrets to unscrupulous competitors			0
’ @entity16 communications director @entity186 said that if the allegations of hacking were true they would be ‘ disturbing ’ .			0

security company @entity35 says it *believes* there is one ' state actor ' behind the attacks
some experts believe the evidence points to @entity6
