@entity0 has a new resident – the long - lost cat chancellor @entity3 and his family had assumed has vanished for ever			1
@entity5 was just a few months old when she went missing from the @entity6 ’ @entity8 home three years ago			1
mr @entity3 , wife @entity9 and their two young children @entity10 and @entity13 searched the streets of @entity15 and put up ‘ lost ’ posters , but to no avail			0
back where she belongs : @entity5 the cat is settling in at @entity0 after being reunited with the @entity3 family they gave up hope long before moving into @entity0 last year , assuming the cat had got lost – or worse , been run over			1
so they transferred their affections to the family budgie , @entity27 , named after @entity28 hero @entity27 , and two goldfish			0
but two weeks ago , @entity9 , an author , received a phone call telling her @entity5 was alive and well			2
she had been living as a stray in a garden a few streets away from the @entity6 ’ @entity8 house , lovingly fed and looked after by a neighbour who had not seen the posters			1
nice surprise : the chancellor and his family had given up hope of finding @entity5 after she went missing three years ago @entity5 , looking particularly well - nourished , was reunited with the @entity41 after a visit to a vet revealed a microchip beneath its skin bearing mrs @entity47 ’s phone number			1
a few days later , @entity5 , looking fit and healthy , was installed in @entity0			1
this time , they took no chances , keeping @entity50 until she could get acclimatised to her new surroundings			0
the @entity6 live in the flat above no 10 , which they moved into more than a year after the 2010 election , while the @entity55 live above no 11			0
before @entity5 was let loose in the garden , one vital matter had to be dealt with : a formal introduction to @entity59 , the @entity55 ’ cat			2
fortunately for all , the fur did not fly , and yesterday @entity5 was allowed outside			0
a @entity63 spokesman said : ‘ she is settling in nicely and getting on well with family , staff and @entity59			0
’ neighbour : the @entity55 ' cat @entity59 ( pictured ) is getting on well with @entity5 trading places : @entity5 lives with the @entity41 in the flat above no 10 ( right ) , while the @entity55 and their cat @entity59 live above no 11 ( left )			2

tabby cat @entity5 went missing from the @entity6 ' @entity8 home three years ago
she was living as a stray in a garden only a few streets away and being fed by an *unknowing* neighbour
now fit and healthy , @entity5 is making herself at home at @entity0
