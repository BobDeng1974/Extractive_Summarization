police , bouncers and hospital workers are gearing up for one of the busiest weekends of the year as the office @entity5 season reaches its climax			1
the final weekend before december 25th will be marked by a spike in corporate festive gatherings , with pubs , bars and clubs preparing for bumper sales			1
friday december 19th is considered by police to be the busiest night for @entity15 parties , with many forces already tweeting words of advice for would - be revellers			1
thousands of revellers will head out across the @entity20 this friday for work and social drinking events police are on high alert for disturbances and fights to cope with the fallout from @entity15 parties party planners have said firms are beginning to splash the cash again this year , having emerged from the shadows of the economic slump which has blighted recent shindigs			1
however , social media experts believe the potential for long - term damage to their reputation is causing some people to tone down their antics - or forgo the festivities altogether - through fear that their drunken exploits will be the talk of the @entity46 feed			1
digital communications expert @entity47 said : ' people are 100 per cent being more sensible than ever before because of social media - reputations can be lost in one night			1
' staff are behaving better , reducing their alcohol consumption or even deciding against going to their party because they do n't want to end up doing something silly they later regret			0
admissions to hospital due to alcohol misuse will likely rise on friday ' instant communication , @entity61 posts and checking - in facilities mean it is very difficult to delete something once it is online			1
' people i speak to say the office @entity5 is getting more and more tame			0
' street pastors are already turning to social media in an effort to use it as a force for good during party season			0
@entity71 have launched a # @entity73 campaign reminding revellers of responsible drinking and appropriate behaviour			1
a spokesman said : ' this friday is one of the busiest nights within the night - time economy - the last friday before @entity15			1
' generally it is also one of the busiest nights for police , ambulance , @entity86 and street patrol projects such as @entity88			1
' their tips include drinking plenty of water , staying in groups of friends , and keeping money back to afford transport home at the end of the evening			0
@entity100 , from bespoke venue operator @entity99 , said the @entity15 party is enjoying a bumper year			1
she said : ' there are more cranes around @entity104 this year , more buildings going up , and that is a useful indicator of a change in the economy			1
' we have seen a marked increase in the number of inquiries about @entity15 parties , budgets have increased too , and the spend per head			1
' people are also looking for something different - they do n't necessarily want to hit the bar , they want something civilised and often with a sit - down meal or some sort of activity such as cocktail - making			1
' this is only the first year after the economic slump so it 's hard to draw too many conclusions but the signs are encouraging			0
' whether you ’re the host or a guest , be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink @entity134 ’s @entity133 , @entity135 , gives you some top tips … 1			1
@entity137 not only will having a designated driver ( @entity137 ) ensure a safe end to the night , it will also avoid those lengthy late night taxi queues			1
do a deal with the drinkers so they pay for the @entity146 soft drinks all night			2
take the @entity137 role in turn so everyone can have a drink if they want to and everyone gets a night off the booze , too			1
set the @entity154 it can be hard to keep track of your drinking if you all get a round in			0
it also tempts you to drink more than you intended – after all , when it ’s your round you do n’t want to opt for the diet cola and when it ’s someone else ’s shout , it ’d be a shame to miss out			2
sticking to one type of drink throughout the night will help you keep a tally of how much you ’ve had			1
make sure to drink plenty of water , too			2
the @entity174 mobile app can even send you a text to remind you to take it easy or let you know it ’s time to go home , as well as keeping track of your units			2
@entity182 … pounding head , dry mouth , sensitive stomach , never drinking again ? forget all the novelty hangover cures – the only thing that really works is time			2
it takes one hour for your liver to process each unit of alcohol so in the meantime , get plenty of fluids , plenty of rest and take at least one night off ( preferably more ) before drinking again			2
the night before there are things that you can do while you ’re out to lessen the effects of tomorrow ’s hangover			2
firstly , drink less by alternating one alcoholic and one soft drink throughout the night			1
it will keep you hydrated and you ’ll feel better in the morning			0
secondly , do n’t mix your drinks , the different tannins , sulphites and other additives can upset your stomach			0
thirdly , do n’t drink on an empty stomach , you ’re more likely to feel ill. finally , put a bottle of water by your bed before you go out so that it ’s within easy reach when you wake up at 6am feeling queasy			2
behind the wheel a good night ’s sleep and a hearty breakfast may make you feel better the next day but it does n’t mean you ’ll be safe to drive			2
allow one hour for every unit consumed ( a can of lager or a glass of wine can be about 3 units ) and do n’t drive until you ’re sure all the alcohol is out of your system			0
a @entity228 breath test will help you workout whether you ’re still under the influence			0
show me the way to go home make your plan for getting home before you go out			0
if you intend to stay out overnight , check with your host that this is a definite arrangement or book yourself into a nearby hotel			0
keep a stash of cash and / or condoms somewhere about your person , too			0
host with the @entity245 try making a fruit punch or experiment with mocktails so that your non-drinking guests have the option of more than just cola or orange juice			0
serve snacks at regular intervals , and do n’t insist on refilling glasses if guests have had enough			0
if a guest does have a few too many , call them a taxi or let them sleep it off in your spare room			0
the @entity263 few things are more embarrassing than having to phone up the party host to apologise for your drunken behaviour the night before			2
if you have a tendency to go overboard when celebrating , set yourself a limit and stick to it			0
slow down your drinking and pace yourself throughout the night			2
make sure you have mixers with spirits and eat something before you go out			0
the one - too - many mate whether you ’re the host or a guest , be prepared to deal with the friend who has had too much to drink			1
encourage them to switch to water , lead them to the smallest room if they feel sick and sit them down somewhere quiet to recover			0
check on them regularly and put them in the recovery position if they fall asleep			0
people are very vulnerable when drunk – violence , accidents , alcohol poisoning – so make sure your friend gets home safely			0
@entity297 now , pay later if ‘ @entity15 ’ means ‘ free booze ’ to you – beware ! it can be very tempting to over indulge when the drinks are on the house			1
not only can drinking too much too quickly be dangerous ( the equivalent of a bottle of vodka in an hour can easily kill an adult male ) but drunken behaviour in front of colleagues and loved ones can have repercussions long after the hangover has worn off .			0

the friday before @entity15 is one of the busiest in night - time economy
marked by spike in festive gatherings , with bars preparing for bumper sales
