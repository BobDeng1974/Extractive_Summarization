by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 is reflecting on the challenge he faces in the next fortnight			2
on saturday there is @entity5 , the following thursday it is @entity7			2
for a defender who has never been to a major tournament before , it is some way to start			1
‘ i ’ve said many times when i ’ve come off the pitch , “ i was unbelievable there for 87 minutes ” , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ and all of a sudden you switch off once , a cross comes in and he scores			2
it wrecks your whole game			2
that ’s the nature of my position			2
one to ponder : @entity1 trains with @entity20 as he looks ahead to a tough clash with @entity22 's @entity5 ‘ i would n’t say i come off the pitch and forget all about it because i do n’t			1
it goes through my head			0
i replay it a lot but then , once you start your preparation for the next game , you want to go straight back out and play			1
’ @entity1 , 28 , is commendably light - hearted about the angst that comes with the job			1
asked whether there is one error that haunts him , he laughs : ‘ i was all right until you brought it up ! ’ it is one of the @entity40 defender ’s strengths , the ability to remain upbeat			1
dwelling on mistakes is hardly productive			0
getting his head together : @entity5 controls a football with his head during a training session with @entity22 eye on the ball : @entity1 has claimed @entity5 ( above ) is a world class player ‘ when goals go in , you always think , “ what could you have done ? ” , ’ he says			1
‘ nine times out of 10 you are just in and around somewhere but if it is a blatant mistake , where you think , “ wow , that was totally down to me ” then of course you have to learn from it			0
you try to make them as few as possible			0
@entity56 , that ’s the idea			0
’ so to @entity5 , the threat next saturday in @entity62			0
the only certainty about the former @entity65 star is his capriciousness			0
‘ that ’s dangerous is n’t it because you never know , will he turn up , will he not ? ’ says @entity1			0
‘ he ’s got the potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards			0
he ’s an unpredictable player but on his day he ’s one of the best			1
out for the count : @entity1 ( centre ) missed @entity73 after picking up an injury in a warm - up clash with @entity76 ‘ i played against him a couple of times at @entity80 and he ’s been tough			1
i played against him another time when he came off after 60 , 70 minutes			0
he can be world class			1
they ’re just dangerous players but you come up against them every game			0
’ @entity1 ’s @entity20 debut came four years ago at the age of 24 when he was part of the new wave of players coming in after the @entity89			1
he might have been in @entity90 but his run - up to selection was disrupted by a potentially fatal blood clot , which meant he had to have a rib removed and miss a chunk of the season			1
he missed @entity73 when he broke his jaw in the last friendly , against @entity76 at @entity97 , before @entity20 flew out to @entity98			1
‘ it ’s my first tournament and i have waited a long time for it , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ so for me to be involved in this is massive			0

but @entity20 centre - back *labels* @entity22 *striker* 's form as unpredictable
' world class ' @entity109 *hitman* proven ' tough ' *opponent* for @entity40 defender
