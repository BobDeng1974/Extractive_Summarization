it may be 65 years since @entity1 last faced @entity2 but for one @entity2 follower , it still feels like only yesterday			1
for @entity4 , 81 , will be the only @entity2 supporter at @entity5 on sunday that was also on the terraces on february 12 , 1949			1
that was the day when sir @entity9 ’s team hosted non-league @entity10 , the @entity12 outfit that had startled top - flight @entity13 in the 4th round to secure a glamour tie against @entity2 at @entity16			1
as it transpired , it was like carthorses against greyhounds as @entity2 blitzed their visitors , winning 8 - 0 in front of a quite remarkable crowd of 81,565			1
@entity2 supporter @entity4 saw the @entity24 take on @entity10 in 1949 at @entity16 @entity4 paid three shillings to see sir @entity9 's ( left ) side thrash @entity10 8 - 0 in front of 81,565 fans it is the 8th biggest attendance to watch a @entity2 game and testament to just how highly the @entity31 was revered in a bygone era			1
‘ i will never forget that day , ’ @entity4 tells @entity33 , ‘ i had a brain operation in 1996			2
i came off my ladder and cracked my skull			0
i died twice that night			0
that ’s what the kids told me			0
it affects my short - term memory			0
i could n’t tell you what i had for dinner yesterday but that day against @entity10 is still as clear as day			2
@entity4 bursts into a nostalgic smile as takes a trip down memory line : ‘ they were closing the gates half - an - hour before kick - off because there were so many people			1
my ticket cost me 3 shillings - or 15 pence			1
‘ @entity54 ’ , he adds , blowing out his cheeks			0
‘ the atmosphere was really special , they had all us youngsters on their shoulders , passing us forward so we could see the game			0
it was another world to these days			0
‘ @entity65 scored five , @entity64 two , then @entity62 and @entity63 sealed the victory			0
’ he has been to every @entity2 cup final since 1948 and missed just two @entity69 games in the last 15 years @entity70 will be hoping @entity2 win on sunday as comfortably as they did back in 1949 for @entity4 , known as ‘ @entity74 ’ by those who travel regularly with the @entity2 team - he has missed only two @entity69 away games in the last 15 years and attended every @entity2 cup final since 1948 - it was a day of special significance			1
‘ i was 16 and i went for a job interview for that day with my @entity2 scarf , my hat and my rattle			2
my mum said ‘ you ’ll never get a job like that			0
’ but i had to get to the game			0
i sat in the office and the manager says , “ to be honest with you , mr @entity4 , we do n’t have any vacancies ... but just hang on , i ’m like you , i ’m a @entity2 supporter			1
so that ’s why i ’m giving you a job			0
” so i ended up working there as an optical mechanic for the next 22 years - all to go and see @entity2 against @entity1			1
’ @entity99 clippings from the time reported : ‘ @entity10 went home from @entity102 , where the day ’s biggest crowd saw them beaten 8 - 0 with £ 3,000 to add to the £ 2,000 they add from previous ties			1
@entity2 ’s scoring machine clicked into action after five minutes and so brilliant was their football that the goals just had to come			2
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity112 was doubly unlucky			2
badly hurt after 20 minutes ( a stomach cut which he said nothing about needed four stitches after the game ) , he found @entity65 shooting “ as hard as i have ever seen him ” , to quote manager sir @entity9			0

@entity4 saw @entity2 beat @entity10 8 - 0 in 1949
he will be the only fan on sunday who also saw the match 65 years *ago*
@entity4 paid just three shillings to watch the match at @entity16
the 81 - year - old has been to every @entity2 cup final since 1948
and he has only missed two @entity69 away games in the last 15 years
