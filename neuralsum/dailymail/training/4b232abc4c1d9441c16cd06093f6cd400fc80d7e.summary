by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:28 am on 22nd november 2011 three top @entity3 leaders accused of orchestrating @entity5 's ‘ killing fields ’ went on trial today before a @entity8 backed tribunal more than three decades after some of the 20th century 's worst atrocities			1
judge @entity11 declared the trial open and read the names of the three senior @entity3 leaders who are defendants in the tribunal in the @entity5 capital , @entity17			1
the defendants , who sat side by side with their lawyers , are 85 - year - old @entity22 , the @entity3 's chief ideologist and the no. 2 leader behind the late @entity25 ; 80 - year - old @entity26 , an ex-head of state ; and 86 - year - old @entity29 , the former foreign minister			1
on trial : defendants from left to right - former @entity3 second - in - command @entity22 , former president @entity26 and former foreign minister @entity29 are on trial in @entity5 for crimes connected to the @entity3 as they were : @entity3 leaders @entity26 ( left ) @entity22 ( centre ) with @entity25 ( right ) in january 1986 at a camp in @entity5 a fourth defendant , 79 - year - old @entity38 , was ruled unfit to stand trial last week because she has alzheimer 's disease			1
she is @entity29 's wife and served as the regime 's minister for social affairs			1
the charges against the surviving inner circle of the communist movement include crimes against humanity , genocide , religious persecution , homicide and torture stemming from their 1975 - 79 reign of terror			1
an estimated 1.7 million people died of execution , starvation , exhaustion or lack of medical care as a result of the @entity3 's radical policies , which essentially turned all of @entity5 into a forced labour camp as the movement attempted to create a pure agrarian socialist society			2
intellectuals , entrepreneurs and anyone considered a threat were imprisoned , tortured and often executed			0
former @entity3 deputy pm : @entity29 ( sitting ) was in charge of foreign affairs , pictured in the courtroom during the public hearing at the ( @entity75 ) in @entity17 public hearing : people attending the trial for the former @entity3 leaders at the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) tribunal spokesman @entity80 called the proceedings ‘ the most important trial in the world ’ because of the seniority of those involved			1
‘ it sends a message that the trial , which survivors have been waiting more than three decades for , finally begins , ’ he said			2
the @entity3 's supreme leader , @entity25 , died in 1998 in @entity5 's jungles while a prisoner of his own comrades , who after being toppled from power fought a guerrilla war that did not fully end until the late 1990s			2
there is serious concern that justice may not be done if any of the ageing and infirm defendants dies before a trial is finished			1
charges : the charges against the surviving inner circle of the communist movement include crimes against humanity , genocide , religious persecution , homicide and torture watching from the front row : @entity5 @entity115 monks sit in the courtroom at the @entity75 in @entity17 attending the trial of three top @entity3 leaders the courtroom : @entity5 @entity115 monks walk in front of the courtroom in @entity5 in september , the tribunal announced it would split up the indictments according to charge into separate trials in order to expedite the proceedings			1
the current trial is considering charges involving the forced movement of people and crimes against humanity			1
‘ it 's the first time the senior leadership of the @entity3 is being tried by a court with international backing			2
‘ it 's the first time thousands of victims have had a forum to tell their stories , and demand reparations for their suffering , ’ said @entity137 of the @entity138 , which has been monitoring the tribunal 's work			2
lining up to the trial : @entity5 @entity115 monks queuing up before entering the court facing trail : a @entity5 man looks at pictures of former @entity3 leaders @entity22 , @entity26 , @entity29 and former @entity3 leader ex-social affairs minister @entity38 battle - hardened former @entity3 guerrilla @entity153 echoes the words that have become a mantra for the servants of the ultra-maoist regime that tore @entity5 apart three decades ago			1
‘ we had to follow orders , ’ he said of his role in the bloody ‘ year zero ’ revolution that wiped out 1.7 million @entity5 - a quarter of the population - from 1975 - 1979			0
‘ almost all @entity5 are victims			0
everybody had to follow the regime 's policy , ’ he said			2
‘ those who defied the rules , their fate was death			0
’ like @entity22 , @entity26 and @entity29 , @entity153 , 58 , distances himself from the killings and says his recollection of the harrowing era is vague			1
he tells stories of his battlefield heroics to repel @entity176 invaders but denies responsibility for any of the hundreds of thousands of men , women and children who died of torture , starvation , disease and execution in the rice fields and makeshift jails run by @entity25 's black - clad disciples			1
‘ i do n't know how many people were killed , ’ @entity153 , a former guerrilla commander , now a community leader , told reporters at his home in @entity192 village on the western border with @entity194			0
‘ we had to follow orders			0
it was like living on another planet			0
but that was the only planet we knew			0
’ the closest any of the former cadres have come to disclosure is seen in the documentary film ‘ @entity209 ’ , in which @entity22 , during six years of interviews with journalist @entity206 , admitted threats to the party line were ‘ destroyed ’ if they could not be ‘ corrected or re-educated ’			1
the film is expected to be used as evidence against @entity22 , who denies the charges			1
@entity213 , director of the @entity214 , which has compiled evidence to use during the trial , said it was unlikely defendants would confess but he was confident justice would eventually prevail			1
‘ everyone wants a final judgement of what happened , ’ he said			0
‘ we 've seen the @entity3 has n't changed its attitude			0
they wo n't admit anything , so the tribunal is really important			0
’ ‘ it therefore has a huge potential not only to contribute to justice in @entity5 , but also to contribute dialogue to on - going efforts to bring perpetrators of these kinds of atrocities to justice around the world			0
’ @entity235 , @entity5 co-prosecutor , recalled for the court the brutalities of @entity3 rule , beginning on april 17 , 1975 , when they captured @entity17 to end a bitter five - year civil war , and immediately began the forced evacuation to the countryside of the estimated one million people who had been sheltering in the capital			0
she also recounted the new social order established by the group : personal property was banned , religion , press and all personal freedoms abolished			0
@entity25 had led the @entity3 from its clandestine revolutionary origins to open resistance after a 1970 coup installed a pro-american government and dragged @entity5 directly into the maelstrom of the @entity256			0
when the @entity3 took power in 1975 , they all but sealed off the country to the outside world			0
sending the inhabitants of the cities off to vast rural communes was part of an effort to turn the country into a socialist utopia			0
economic and social disaster ensued , but the failures only fed the group 's paranoia , and suspected traitors said to be working with the @entity273 , or @entity176 , the country 's traditional enemy , were hunted down , only plunging the country further into chaos			2
@entity176 , whose border provinces had suffered bloody attacks , sponsored a resistance movement and invaded , ousting the @entity3 from power in 1979 and installing a client regime			0
the @entity8 - backed tribunal , which was established in 2006 , has tried just one case , convicting @entity286 , the former head of the regime 's notorious @entity287 , last july and sentencing him to 35 years in prison for war crimes , crimes against humanity and other offences			1
that case was seen as much simpler than the current case , which covers a much broader range of activities and because @entity286 confessed to his crimes			2
those going on trial today have steadfastly maintained their innocence			2
the prison chief was also far lower in the regime 's leadership ranks than the current defendants			1
a reminder of the tragedy : a @entity5 man views skulls of @entity3 victims on display at @entity313 in @entity17 , @entity5 in memory : tourists walk near @entity313 stupa , the site of the @entity3 's former ' killing fields ' , on the outskirts of @entity17 not forgotten : a woman cries during a ceremony at a memorial stupa of the @entity3 regime at @entity313 , a ' @entity324 ' site located on the outskirts of @entity17			0

charges against the defendants include crimes against humanity , genocide , religious persecution , homicide and torture
the defendants are : @entity22 , 85 , @entity26 , 80 and @entity29 , 86
a fourth defendant , @entity38 , 79 , was ruled unfit for trial because she has @entity340 's disease
