@entity1 columnist @entity0 may have been slightly premature when he queried whether @entity3 's lifeless outing at @entity4 on monday night could have been his last in a @entity6 shirt			1
the misfiring @entity7 is on loan at @entity9 for the rest of the season , and @entity6 have a £ 43million option to make the deal permanent			1
but here are 10 reasons why they should not			0
@entity3 was hauled off on the hour mark after yet another poor display for @entity6 @entity3 , pictured with @entity19 on monday night , has managed only four goals form 19 matches it was another disappointing night for @entity3 as he failed to complete the 90 minutes against @entity23 because he is not worth it ... when you pay £ 6m to loan someone and then stump up £ 285,000 - a - week in wages you expect something substantial in return			1
that has simply not happened			0
even given @entity6 's spending power and windfalls from the adidas partnership and new tv deal this is a player who , so far , has not done anything to show why they should splash out £ 43m to secure his services permanently			1
@entity3 is replaced by @entity40 with @entity6 losing 1 - 0			1
they went on to win the fifth - round tie 3 - 1 lies , damn lies and statistics ... a @entity47 poet once said that statistics are used like a drunk uses a lamppost – for support and not illumination			2
however , they present a compelling case when it comes to the @entity7			2
with a paltry four goals in 19 games , @entity3 has completed 90 minutes on a mere five occasions			1
at @entity4 , an hour yielded no shots on or off target , no assists and the grand total of 18 passes			0
the @entity7 international made his way to the touchline once he realised his number was being held up that miss against @entity70 ... @entity3 can justifiably point to a lack of chances during his stint in a @entity6 shirt			1
the free - flowing red marauders of recent years now seem a distant memory as @entity78 's men struggle to create openings			0
however , at @entity80 he was given a glorious opportunity			0
clean through and with only the keeper to beat @entity3 failed to control and prodded a tame volley wide			2
it was the kind of opportunity you would have expected him to relish and summed up a miserable season			0
@entity3 spurned a brilliant chance against @entity70 which summed up his disappointing season at @entity6 powerless at @entity23 ... you would have thought @entity3 , a man who has shone on the biggest stages , would have been licking his lips at a trip to a @entity96 side			1
over the course of a difficult hour he failed to trouble an admittedly hard - working and physical third - tier backline and it surprised nobody apart from himself when he was hooked to gleeful cries of ' what a waste of money ' from the home support			0
impact on the rest of the team ... it is just not working			0
after 60 minutes @entity6 were a goal down and heading for their earliest end to a hunt for honours in a season for 28 years			2
one - paced and one - dimensional , they were playing into burly @entity23 's hands			2
@entity115 came @entity3 , replaced by @entity40 , and almost immediately they were playing with width and pace on their way to scoring three goals			2
this was not the first time @entity3 's withdrawal has had a positive impact - something that will not have bypassed the meticulous @entity125			1
@entity40 celebrates with @entity126 after the big @entity127 fired @entity6 into the lead at @entity23 @entity126 struck in the second half as @entity6 completed their comeback against the @entity96 side injury doubts persist ... this , simply put , is not the same player as the goal machine who succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury last january			1
he is not sharp and still seems desperately short of match fitness			0
@entity3 has now made 19 appearances for @entity6 - will he will ever regain the sharpness that made him one of @entity144 football 's hottest properties ? @entity145 ... the so - called super agent is an influential man and one who has a longstanding relationship with @entity6			1
but when he starts criticising the manager you have to wonder if he needs reminding of who pays the bills			0
earlier this month @entity145 made the bold claim that @entity3 would be firing at @entity6 if sir @entity155 was still manager			1
with that latest attack he may have sealed his client 's fate			0
agent @entity159 appeared to suggest that @entity3 would have had more success with former @entity6 manager sir @entity155 rather than under the current regime of @entity78 not what @entity6 need ... @entity125 's relatively late arrival at @entity9 meant that , for the second summer in a row , there was a lack of proper planning behind the club 's moves in the transfer window			1
as a result , the @entity173 appears to have ended up with pieces from separate jigsaws			0
he knows that @entity6 need pace up front – that 's why he 's started untested rookie @entity179 ahead of @entity3 more than once			1
with targets already identified for this summer @entity6 will not make the same mistakes twice			2
@entity3 , pictured here during his side 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity185 , appears to be short on confidence confidence issues ... when you own a gold - plated mobile phone , pick up £ 285,000 - a - week and have @entity192 - like status in your homeland you would imagine confidence is not an issue			1
but for @entity3 it clearly is			0
the pressure of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world coupled with the feeling that this season is a test created by the £ 43m clause appear to be weighing heavily on his shoulders			0
a striker without confidence is a striker without goals			0
old father time ... @entity125 has always been a fan of promoting youth , something he did to great effect at @entity213			0
@entity3 turned 29 earlier this month			0
if the deal was to be made permanent he would be looking for at least a three - year agreement which would take him to 32			2
@entity6 have moved away from their policy of not signing players without a resale value recently but in this case @entity3 's age as well as his form is likely to count against him .			1

@entity3 is on loan at @entity6 for the rest of the season
and the @entity9 club have a £ 43million option to make deal permanent
but it seems unlikely they will make a full - time for the misfiring @entity7
@entity6 are paying @entity3 £ 285,000 a week
but he has scored only four goals in 19 matches
read : @entity3 was nowhere to be seen at @entity23 ... he did *n't* have a shot
