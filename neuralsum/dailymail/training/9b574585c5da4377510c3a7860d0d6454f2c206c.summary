extremely pleased : professor @entity0 , pictured here in 2007 , won his appeal against the @entity3 a doctor struck off over the @entity6 jab controversy yesterday won a @entity8 battle to clear his name			1
professor @entity0 had been found guilty of professional misconduct following claims he took part in unapproved research that suggested links between the vaccine , bowel disease and autism			1
however , a judge overturned the @entity3 ’s ruling and criticised its disciplinary panel ’s ‘ inadequate and superficial reasoning ’ – but also stressed there was ‘ no respectable body of opinion ’ supporting the supposed risks of the jab			2
professor @entity0 lost his licence to practise in may 2010 along with dr @entity30 , who led the research			2
a @entity3 ‘ fitness to practise ’ panel found both men guilty of misconduct over the way the work was conducted after 217 days of deliberation – the longest disciplinary case in the body ’s 150 - year history			1
professor @entity0 , 75 , always denied allegations that he had participated in the research under the guise of carrying out clinical investigations and treatment of young patients , including colonoscopies , at the @entity47 in @entity48			0
the retired doctor said the work was necessary for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment , and was not done to aid the research			0
mr @entity54 criticised the disciplinary panel ’s ‘ inadequate and superficial reasoning ’ and ‘ wrong conclusions ’ before ruling : ‘ the panel ’s determination can not stand			0
’ he called for such cases to be overseen by someone with ‘ judicial experience ’ in future			0
the @entity6 vaccination programme suffered a blow when dr @entity30 suggested a link between the jab , bowel disease and autism in the late 1990s as he left court with relatives , professor @entity0 said : ‘ i am extremely pleased with the outcome of my appeal			1
there has been a great burden on me and my family since the allegations were first made in 2004 and throughout the hearing that ran from 2007 to 2010			0
i am relieved that this matter is now over			0
’ mr @entity54 added that dr @entity30 ’s comments and subsequent publicity about possible links between autism and the @entity6 jab , which protects against measles , mumps and rubella , ‘ had a predictable adverse effect upon the take - up of the vaccine ’ which was ‘ of great concern to those responsible for public health ’			2
he stressed : ‘ there is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [ dr @entity30 ’s ] hypothesis that @entity6 vaccine and autism [ or ] enterocolitis are causally linked			1
’ dr @entity101 , a senior lecturer at the @entity102 , added : ‘ there has never been any sound evidence of a link			0
indeed , there is a strong body of research showing no link			0
however , many parents who were anxious about the safety of the @entity6 vaccine decided not to have their children immunised			1
‘ fortunately , it is never too late to have the @entity6 vaccine and i would strongly recommend that young people who missed out when they were younger have two doses of the vaccine to protect them			1
’ the @entity3 ’s chief executive , @entity118 , said ‘ key changes ’ to its disciplinary hearings were already being prepared .			2

prof @entity122 had carried out some of the tests for the paper that suggested a link between the @entity6 vaccine and autism
