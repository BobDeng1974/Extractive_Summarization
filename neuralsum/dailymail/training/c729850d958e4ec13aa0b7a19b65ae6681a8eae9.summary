by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 07:14 est , 8 january 2014 a primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke - but is still able to write			1
the woman , known only as 40 - year - old @entity6 , developed ‘ word blindness ’ as a result of the stroke			1
the rare condition is thought to occur when the brain ’s language zone is robbed of its visual inputs but remains intact			1
a 40 - year - old primary school teacher lost the ability to read after suffering a stroke			1
however , she can still write and understand speech			0
image shows an mri of the woman 's brain			2
the big arrow identifies the left visual cortex which is responsible for processing visual information			2
the small arrow shows the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres			2
both have been affected by the stroke @entity6 entered her classroom one morning in october 2012 and discovered she was unable to read the names on the register			1
in a panic , she then turned to her lesson plans and discovered that they , too , looked like ‘ hieroglyphs ’			0
@entity6 went to see the school ’s head teacher who was equally baffled and sent her to stay with her mother			2
during the following two days , @entity6 began to experience further problems			2
she could no longer tell the time and it took her several hours to pack a travel bag			0
she also started to have difficulty finding words and she became confused and anxious			0
her mother took her to hospital where she was admitted and diagnosed with a stroke			0
ten months after her stroke , @entity6 was still unable to read but had learnt to decipher words by tracing each letter with her finger			1
the large arrow in the image shows a blockage in one of the arteries in @entity6 's brain			1
the small arrow shows constrictions and dilations in another artery @entity6 was found to be suffering from alexia without agraphia – or ‘ word blindness ’ – a rare condition which causes people to lose the ability to read , but without impeding their ability to write and to understand speech			1
the condition developed as a result of the stroke she suffered			1
it is believed to be caused by lesions in the brain ’s ‘ language zone ’ and occurs when this part of the brain is robbed of its visual inputs but , otherwise , remains intact			1
following the stroke , @entity6 tried to teach herself to read again but her efforts were met with little success			1
she employed the skills she had learnt as a primary school teacher and used flashcards and writing exercises to try and improve her condition			0
however , her efforts failed			0
determined not to give up , she discovered she could decipher a word by tracing each individual letter with her finger			1
writing in the journal @entity94 , her doctors explained : ‘ given a word , @entity6 will direct her attention to the first letter , which she is unable to recognise			1
‘ she will then place her finger on the letter and begin to trace each letter of the alphabet over it in order until she recognises that she has traced the letter she is looking at			0
‘ “ that is the letter @entity110 , ” she declares , after tracing the previous 12 letters of the alphabet with her finger while deciphering a word in front of her			1
‘ three letters later , she is able to shorten this exercise with a guess - “ this word is mother , ” she announces proudly			2
’ while @entity6 is not able to read , some words still elicit an emotional response from her			2
for example , when shown the word ‘ dessert ’ she said ‘ oooh , i like that ’ and when shown the word ‘ asparagus ’ she said ‘ something ’s upsetting me about this word ’			0
@entity6 , who was a teacher , says the thing she misses most is being able to read to children ( file picture ) according to the doctors treating @entity6 , even 10 months after her stroke she was still unable to read			1
she told them she misses reading books to children			0
she said : ‘ one day my mom was with the kids in the family , and they were all curled up next to each other , and they were reading			0
and i started to cry , because that was something i could n't do			0
‘ i could be there , but i could n't pick up the book and read it			0
that 's something that i 'd always done , and it 's something i had a lot of pleasure from			0
and i could n't do it			0
’ @entity6 had to give up teaching and now works at a fitness centre			2
she is planning to write a book about her experiences in an attempt to raise money for stroke research .			0

the 40 - year - old woman , referred to as @entity6 , had a stroke in october 2012
as a result , she developed alexia with agraphia - or ' word blindness '
this rare condition occurs when the brain 's language centre is robbed of its visual inputs but remains otherwise intact , her doctors say
she is still unable to read but has learned to decipher words by tracing the letters with her finger
