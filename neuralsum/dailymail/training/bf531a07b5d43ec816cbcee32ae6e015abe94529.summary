two @entity1 men think they may be in possession of the world 's oldest burger , after they kept a quarter pounder with cheese bought for a friend who never turned up to eat it			1
when @entity9 and @entity10 were 13 an 14 respectively , they took a trip to their local @entity13 's restaurant in @entity14 to grab some food after a party			1
the men picked up an extra for their mate @entity18 who never showed			2
that was 20 years ago			1
@entity18 told the boys to hold on to his meal until next time he came to visit as a joke , and ' he has n't been back yet ' , the men told @entity24			2
' it 's rock hard , absolutely solid as a brick ' the friends said while showing off their prized possession			0
after all that time kept behind closed doors , @entity10 told the program it was time to ' free the burger ' and boys have released a song on @entity50 dedicated to their ' senior burger '			0
' as opposed to a @entity52 ' , @entity10 joked			0
after all that time kept behind closed doors , @entity10 ( left ) told the program it was time to ' free the burger ' they say the burger is ' rock ' hard and ' solid as a brick ' the pair horrified the project hosts when they pretended to eat the burger they have now released a song in honour of ' senior burger ' with all proceeds going to @entity69 all proceeds raised from sales of their song go directly to @entity69 and @entity73 soon asked the pair how much she would have to donate for them to sample the burger			1
despite all @entity24 hosts trying to get @entity9 and @entity10 to take a bite out of the age - old snack and the men playing along , quite quickly they flat out refused			1
' no way you guys are sick ! ' @entity10 laughed			0
' it 's a 20 - year - old burger we 're not eating it , no way			0
' the men have set up a website , @entity91 account and @entity93 page for @entity67 , where fans can purchase merchandise and listen to their serenade to the @entity27 .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 bought the @entity27 20 years ago
they purchased it for their friend @entity18 who never showed to eat it
the pair have kept it under lock and key since 1995
it looks the same as the day it was made but is ' hard as a brick '
