by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 04:21 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:52 est , 21 december 2013 @entity5 chancellor @entity4 today hailed a role played ' behind the scenes ' by former @entity5 foreign minister @entity8 in helping to secure the release of @entity11 critic and @entity13 ex-oil tycoon @entity12			1
' the @entity5 government appreciates the efforts of former federal minister @entity8 who worked intensively on the case behind the scenes , ' @entity4 's spokesman @entity14 said in a statement			0
' he worked successfully on possibilities for a solution with a great level of commitment and the support of the chancellor and the foreign ministry			0
' @entity8 , 86 , said in a statement he had decided to support @entity12 's case ' for humanitarian reasons ' having met him several times in the past			2
he also thanked @entity4 , a fellow @entity5 former foreign minister and the @entity5 ambassador in @entity57 for lending ' the greatest possible support ' to his efforts			0
@entity8 , who arranged the flight on a private jet from @entity13 and picked @entity12 up at the airport in @entity38 , told news website @entity64 that @entity12 was doing well under the circumstances			1
' he is exhausted but very happy to finally be free , ' he said by telephone , adding that @entity12 now wanted to rest and would stay out of the public eye			2
@entity68 said @entity12 could be heard in the background talking to friends and relatives by phone			0
it said he had received a visa that would allow him to stay for one year in the @entity76 passport - free zone			0
an @entity78 helicopter takes off near the prison where @entity12 was being held the @entity13 prison service said he had petitioned to be allowed to leave the country to meet his mother and insisted that he left the country of his own free will			1
it is not known if he left in this helicopter activity : @entity78 officers move a stretcher near an ambulance , although it is not clear if this was linked to the release of @entity12 @entity13 's @entity93 said in a statement that @entity12 had petitioned to be allowed to travel to @entity5 to meet his mother who is reportedly being treated for cancer			1
in his 10 years in prison on politically tinged charges of tax evasion and embezzlement , 50 - year - old @entity12 turned from a powerful oligarch into a respected dissident , becoming a political thinker who argued for social justice and placed the blame on mr @entity51 for @entity13 's stagnating economy			1
it was n't clear whether @entity12 would continue his opposition to the @entity11			2
mr @entity51 's announcement less than 24 hours before that @entity12 would be pardoned appeared to catch both the public and @entity12 's lawyers by surprise			1
his release was equally shrouded in mystery			0
several hours before , @entity12 's lawyers and family said they still had no idea when he would be let out			2
reunion : the @entity13 prison service said @entity12 was on his way to @entity5 where his cancer - stricken mother @entity122 ( right ) , who is undergoing medical treatment compassionate grounds : @entity51 said that @entity13 's most famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his mother was ill @entity12 's father , @entity128 , speaking on the phone from the @entity57 region said he and his wife , are in @entity57 and are going to fly to @entity5 on saturday			1
@entity12 's second wife and three children live in the @entity57 region			2
his eldest son from the first marriage lives with his family in @entity137			0
in a shock remark after his annual marathon news conference yesterday , @entity51 had said that @entity13 's most famous prisoner had asked for clemency on humanitarian grounds as his mother was ill. the @entity11 followed with a swift announcement today that @entity51 had already signed the pardon decree			1
' guided by humanitarian principles , i decree that @entity12 ... should be pardoned and freed from any further punishment in the form of imprisonment			2
' this decree comes into force from the day of its signing , ' said the decree signed by @entity51 and published by the @entity11			2
@entity12 and his business partner @entity153 were convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2005			1
intense atmosphere : @entity51 pictured during a meeting with @entity12 in 2002 , a year before the oil tycoon was snatched off his corporate plane in 2003 soon after @entity51 warned oligarchs against meddling in politics @entity51 made the controversial claim that there was no difference between ' dictators ' @entity165 and @entity167			1
the @entity11 leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the @entity172 tyrant and other @entity174 leaders more than two decades after they were toppled			0
one contentious plan backed by @entity13 hardliners would see monuments to @entity165 and the feared founder of the @entity172 secret services @entity180 brought back in @entity57 , moves which @entity51 likened to the monument to @entity167 outside the @entity183			1
' how in particular is @entity167 so different from @entity165 ? can you tell me ? not in any way at all , ' he said			0
' from the point of view of liberals , he is the same bloody dictator			0
' of @entity167 - a soldier and statesman who signed @entity194 's death warrant before becoming @entity196 's protector - he said : ' he was quite a treacherous dude , one has to say			0
' @entity12 was then convicted of embezzlement in a second trial in 2010 and had been due for release in august			1
it remained unclear exactly when the 50 - year - old would be freed from his prison colony in the town of @entity46 in the @entity205 region of northwestern @entity13			2
the circumstances of the pardon also remained murky			0
the former chief of @entity210 oil company , once @entity13 's richest man , had repeatedly said he would not ask @entity51 for a pardon because it would be tantamount to admitting guilt			1
the @entity216 broadsheet , citing unnamed sources , said on friday @entity12 had made the decision to seek a pardon after a recent meeting with representatives of @entity13 's security services , who had raised the menace of a third trial against him			1
members of the security services met with @entity12 over the last several days , told him the health of his cancer - stricken mother @entity228 , 79 , was worsening and warned him about a possible third criminal case against him			2
' this conversation , which was conducted without lawyers , forced @entity12 to turn to the president , ' said the newspaper			0
economists and political analysts put the announcement down to the @entity11 's bid to improve its dismal rights record and international image ahead of the @entity241 that @entity13 is hosting in @entity242 in february			2
@entity12 had been due to be released in august 2014 but @entity13 prosecutors earlier this month raised the threat of a third trial for the former tycoon on money - laundering charges			1
@entity51 told reporters on thursday that he saw no prospects for the third case			0
economists and political analysts said that while @entity12 's imminent release was a watershed moment it would not dramatically change @entity13 's battered investment climate or international image			1
rivals : @entity51 has long singled out @entity12 , who would be due for release in august , for bitter personal attacks , once saying that ' a thief should sit in jail ' ' it is a very important signal , ' said prominent economist @entity262 , who co-authored a critical report on @entity12 's second conviction in 2010			1
' in and of itself it will not change anything but it will give hope to investors , ' @entity262 told @entity270 in e-mailed comments			0
he said , however , that @entity51 's promise to release @entity12 was not enough to make him return to @entity13			1
earlier this year , @entity262 had fled to @entity273 after coming under pressure from investigators for his role in the @entity12 report			0
the @entity279 consultancy said the former tycoon 's release was a ' charm offensive ' ahead of the @entity283 amid reports that heads of major states like @entity287 of the @entity288 and @entity273 's @entity289 will not be in attendance			0
political enemy : supporters have said that @entity12 ( pictured when he ceo of @entity210 oil company in 2001 ) had been thrown into jail after two trials for daring to finance opposition to the @entity13 strongman @entity300 business daily compared the announcement to a ' a trump card ' @entity51 pulled out of his sleeve at a critical moment			1
' @entity12 personally no longer presents a threat to the system , ' it said , noting that his release would not ' heal the wounds inflicted on the economy and society 10 years ago			0
' ' investments will not return , businesses that were closed down or were never created will not be born again , those who emigrated will not come back , ' said @entity300			0

he was snatched off his corporate plane in 2003 soon after @entity51 warned oligarchs against meddling in politics			0
