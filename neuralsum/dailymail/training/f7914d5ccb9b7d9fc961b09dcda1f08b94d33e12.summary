' there 'll be a lot of crisp , winter sunshine for with tuesday night into wednesday morning expected to be the coldest at between -1 and @entity10			1
' particularly in the south east corner it 'll feel pretty cold , temperatures will not get much higher than 7 or @entity67 and there 'll be a lot of cloud around which will make it feel colder			2
the feel of the day will be much different , ' said forecaster @entity73			0
' the bulk of @entity8 and @entity9 will be cloudy and not very warm			1
' @entity75 is expected in the @entity76 , though it is too soon to predict whether or not the rest of the @entity13 is on track for a white @entity20			2

rangers at the trust fear the frogs have been confused by the weather and that their spawn is now at risk of being killed for winter temperatures			2
' although spring is generally arriving earlier , to receive a frogspawn sighting before winter has properly begun is highly unusual , ' said dr @entity138			0
' sadly it is unlikely the spawn will now survive the frosts we are experiencing			0
' we need people to keep adding their valuable information to our survey to allow scientists to learn whether frogs are able to adapt or not			0

' this week 's weather is slightly colder than what was seen in 2013 , when the average temperature for december in @entity8 was more than @entity171			1
but the unseasonably warm temperatures over the last few months made autumn one of the balmiest on record , and brought on the early arrival of a fall of lambs , according to one farmer			0
@entity178 said he was convinced the unexpected birth of two sets of the animals had been encouraged by the warm autumn weather			0
the farmer from @entity184 welcomed the @entity186 breed twins and one pure bred @entity188 lamb last weekend , a month expected			2
' the first set were born at 7am on sunday morning and the other three were born at 3.30am on monday			0
we 're about a month early with the lambing - we did n't get our earliest lambs until the end of december last year			0
' i do n't know why it 's happened , maybe it 's down to the funny weather we 've been having but i was quite amazed when i realised			0
' it was a busy weekend for me as i was constantly checking on them but it 's lovely to see the little lambs there			0
