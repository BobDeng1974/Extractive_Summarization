sunday will give us an opportunity to take a look at @entity3 and @entity4 when @entity5 play @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity3 has clearly become one of the stars of the @entity11 in the five months he has been here and with @entity14 on the verge of returning , @entity8 will soon be able to field a front three of @entity14 , @entity3 and @entity17			2
that is a forward line with as much pace and which will inspire almost as much fear as @entity6 ’s front three from last season : @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity4			2
@entity3 has had huge impact at @entity5 since his £ 30m arrival from @entity28 young @entity6 forward @entity4 could learn a lot from @entity3 what i love about @entity3 is his hunger			1
hard work is n’t a dirty word for him ; he puts in a shift			0
he shares that attribute with @entity24 and @entity37			0
it is as though the @entity40 players , who have come from relatively tough backgrounds , are grateful for opportunities they have and have n’t forgotten the hard work it took to get them to where they are			0
but @entity3 ’s best quality is his calmness in the penalty area to finish chances off — and if @entity4 can learn from that , he can become a truly great player			1
the @entity6 flyer is still young — he was 20 earlier this month — but there are similarities with @entity3 in that he can get into the same positions , whether he plays down the middle or down the side			1
@entity3 puts in a shift for @entity5 and he can also find the back of the net @entity4 scored twice for @entity6 in wednesday 's @entity62 victory at @entity63 the next step for him is to become a finisher — do that and in two or three years ’ time he could end up at @entity28 or @entity67			1
he ’s not ready for that now , but he could be			0
@entity24 managed to work on his finishing during his time at @entity6 and @entity14 has improved over the past few years , so it can be done			0
@entity4 gets in there time and time again , which is evidence enough of his quality			2
when he becomes a clinical finisher , he will be a frightening prospect .			0

@entity3 will go head **-** to **-** head with @entity4 on @entity81 's best quality is his calmness to finish chances off
@entity85 : there are many similarities between @entity3 and @entity4
