out with the old and in with the new			0
@entity2 ’s loyalty towards his @entity3 has at times been painfully frustrating but the @entity5 coach insists his starting xv for saturday ’s @entity6 against @entity7 has been picked purely on form			1
fresh faces have been included in place of some ageing veterans , who may well have passed their peak			0
it could signal the turning point as @entity5 bid to end a run of 20 straight defeats against @entity7 , @entity17 and @entity18 — the southern hemisphere ’s ‘ big three ’			1
@entity2 has dropped four of his most experienced players for saturday 's @entity6 against @entity7 @entity25 scrum - half @entity23 will start against the @entity7 in place of veteran number nine @entity28 @entity29 , the 95 - cap tighthead prop , was left out of the squad completely , while 42 - cap @entity31 and the @entity3 duo of @entity33 and @entity34 have been named on the bench			1
in come @entity36 , 21 , @entity37 , 23 , @entity23 , 25 , and @entity38 , who is 32 but enjoying a new lease of life with @entity41			1
‘ the criticism that has been levelled at me in the past is that i ’ve been stubborn and not made changes , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ so if you look at @entity23 and @entity47 , they ’ve been the form nine and 10 for the @entity25 and they ’ve been selected on form			2
‘ for us , there is a lot of logic in the decisions we have made and we are pretty excited and positive about the selection			0
from my point of view , they are pretty justifiable			0
’ there was an air of inevitability about the head coach ’s press conference at the @entity65 yesterday			1
having not beaten a southern hemisphere side since the 21 - 18 win against the @entity7 in 2008 , questions about ‘ psychological barriers ’ have become commonplace over the last few series of autumn internationals			1
after that last victory , @entity2 said his side were carrying the flag for the northern hemisphere			2
six years later and the flag is at half mast			0
there have been moments of celebration — notably two @entity81 , a @entity83 semi-final and , most recently , a heavily @entity5 - influenced @entity85 series victory — but that all seemed like distant memories after this summer ’s 38 - 16 thumping by @entity18 in @entity89			1
veteran @entity5 and @entity3 loosehead @entity33 has been dropped for @entity41 prop @entity38 @entity37 ( right ) , in action against @entity93 in march , will line up alongside @entity94 at lock ‘ our primary focus over the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the @entity83 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and @entity101 and those are important games for us , the long - term objective is getting out of that group and making the quarter - finals			0
’ some of @entity2 ’s newer faces will not carry the fear that becomes engrained by defeat after defeat and this weekend is the best opportunity for a major autumn scalp			2
@entity7 have a new coach , @entity111 , following their recent off - field controversies , and looked slack defensively in their narrow victory over the @entity117 on saturday			2
@entity2 , however , will not be caught cold			0
@entity118 ; @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 ; @entity47 , @entity23 ; @entity38 , @entity123 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , a @entity124 ; @entity125 , @entity126 ( capt ) , @entity127			1
subs : @entity129 , @entity33 , @entity130 , @entity31 , @entity131 , @entity34 , @entity132 , @entity133			2
‘ you ca n’t underestimate them , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ a lot of people have been talking about what ’s happened with @entity139 ( he was fined £ 24,600 for sending an offensive picture message to an @entity142 female team official ) and those sorts of things			0
does that make them more vulnerable ? with @entity148 , it makes them stronger			0
so we are expecting a really tough game			0
’ outside centre @entity151 keeps his place in the @entity154 and the 23 - year - old ’s showdown with @entity157 , filling in for the injured @entity158 , will be one of the most significant head - to - heads			1
@entity2 has complete faith in @entity157 ’s ability , even suggesting a longer - term move for the @entity165 wing			2
‘ there are a lot of class players who started on the wing and moved to the centre , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ there are two prime examples in @entity172 and @entity173			0
so it ’s an option for us ( to make @entity120 ’s long - term position centre )			0
but it ’s one position we feel we ’ve got a bit of strength in depth in			0
