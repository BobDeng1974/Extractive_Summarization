experts this week have warned the internet could be running out of space , but it could also be under a completely different threat - sharks			1
@entity4 protects its underwater data cables from shark bites with a hi - tech material , according to one of its employees			1
the fibre optic cables are responsible for carrying the world ’s internet traffic , and they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes , as well as from shark bites that could break the backbone of the internet			1
a stock image of a great white shark is shown one of the search giant ’s product managers told @entity27 that the firm uses a @entity21 - like material to provide extra cushioning for cables in the @entity32 in order to protect them from shark bites			1
@entity21 is a high - strength armoured synthetic fibre designed by @entity37 , and it seems that @entity4 uses its own equivalent			1
it is thought that the creatures are so interested in the cables because of the magnetic field they create , which is similar to those made by fish in distress			1
@entity49 may chomp on the cables in the mistaken belief they are about to get an easy meal			2
here , a shark attacks a fibre optic cable ( not necessarily one of @entity4 's ) perhaps because it was attracted by the electric or magnetic field the fibre optic cables ( illustrated ) are responsible for carrying the world ’s internet traffic and while they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes , there is a risk that sharks could damage the backbone of the internet lasers are used in the fibre optic cables to send information through glass			1
data can be transmitted at speeds of up to one gigabit per second , which is around 100 times faster than copper connections , which appear to be unappealing to sharks			2
the fibres are encased in plastic coatings in different colours , then wrapped in a protective layer of @entity21 - like material before being sheathed in a polyurethane jacket			1
not only does this provide cushioning from knocks and movement , the coating prevents electricity leaking and minimises electrical and magnetic fields emitted			0
@entity4 has not commented on the attacks , but experts claim it is likely other companies also take measures to protect their cables from apex predators			1
@entity4 's @entity96 project will connect @entity97 to the west coast of the @entity99			1
the cable will stretch 5,000 miles ( 8,000km ) under the ocean at depths of around 7,000 miles ( 11,300km ) and will then link with local cable systems already in place			0
faster is expected to be complete by @entity106 @entity4 is investing further in the underground cable network by backing a project that will span the @entity32			2
called faster , the $ 300 million ( £ 178 million ) scheme will connect @entity97 to the west coast of the @entity99			0
the cable will stretch 5,000 miles ( 8,000km ) under the ocean , and will then link up with local cable systems already in place			0
faster is expected to be completed by @entity106			0
on the @entity97 side , the cable will land at @entity117 and @entity118 and is designed to improve the network further into @entity120			0
while on the @entity99 side , the cable will connect networks in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127			0
‘ at @entity4 we want our products to be fast and reliable , and that requires a great network infrastructure , whether it 's for the more than a billion @entity134 users or developers building products on @entity137 , ’ said @entity128 , senior vice president of technical infrastructure at @entity4			2
‘ and sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean			0
' that ’s why we ’re investing in @entity96 , a new undersea cable that will connect major @entity143 cities in the @entity99 to two coastal locations in @entity97 with a design capacity of 60 terabits per second			0
’ that ’s ten million times faster than a household cable modem			0
@entity4 has previously invested in other cable projects , including @entity149 in 2008 , which also joined @entity97 to the @entity99 , and the @entity150 ( @entity151 ) in 2011 .			2

the fibre optic cables are responsible for carrying the world ’s internet traffic
a @entity4 employee *reportedly* said the company protects its cables from shark bites with a @entity21 - like armoured material
it 's thought sharks might attack the cables because of their magnetic field
predators are thought to *confuse* it with signals given off by distressed fish
@entity4 has not commented on the claims
