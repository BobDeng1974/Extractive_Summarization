now the saleslady has hit back , stating : ' i was n't sure what i should present to her when she came in on the afternoon of saturday july 20 so i showed her some bags from the @entity38 collection			2
' i explained to her the bags came in different sizes and materials , like i always do			2
' she looked at a frame behind me			2
far above there was the 35,000 @entity11 franc crocodile leather bag			2
' i simply told her that it was like the one i held in my hand , only much more expensive , and that i could show her similar bags			1
' it is absolutely not true that i declined to show her the bag on racist grounds			1
i even asked her if she wanted to look at the bag			2
' she looked around the store again but did n't say anything else			2
then she went with her companion to the lower floor			2
my colleague saw them to the door			2
they were not even in the store for five minutes			0
' she emphatically denied ever saying to @entity1 : ' you do n't want to see this bag			1
you can not afford it			0
it ’s a misunderstanding ' and insisted her saleswomen put customers first and try to be ' kind ' the shop assistant said she only sells a £ 25,000 handbag a few times a year and said the racist claims are ' absurd ' the saleslady went on : ' this is not true			1
i would never say something like that to a customer			0
good manners and politeness are the @entity92 and the @entity93 in this business			0
' i do n't know why she is making these accusations			1
she is so powerful and i am just a shop girl			1
' i did n't hurt anyone			0
i do n't know why someone as great as her must cannibalize me on tv			0
' if it had all taken place as she claimed , why has she not complained the next day at the wedding of @entity27 with @entity75 , my boss ? she was there also at the @entity27 wedding as a guest			1
i do n't understand it			0
' i spoke to @entity1 in @entity107			1
my @entity107 is okay but not excellent , unfortunately			0
' i did n't know who she was when she came into the store			0
that would n't have made any difference if i had			0
miss @entity1 said of the encounter : ' i could have had the big blow - up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff			1

' if someone asks me whether he or she can see an article , i always present these			0
because that person is a potential buyer			0
and my job is to sell it			0
' i 'm glad if i can sell an article			0
it is a reward for me , if i can sell a nice piece			0
this means that i 'm good at my job			0
