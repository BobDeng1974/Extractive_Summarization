mr @entity9 's long - time friend @entity50 - who shared the picture on his @entity53 account after learning of the tragedy - told the @entity54 : ' he was a kind , loving and caring man with high passion for his work and football			1
' the heartbreaking picture of mr @entity9 , who worked for @entity63 newspaper , is just one of the traces left behind of the passengers ' final hours			1
many of the 16 @entity45 schoolchildren , who had been in @entity6 on an exchange , messaged friends and family as they boarded the plane			1
among them were 16 - year - old @entity73 , who friends described as a ‘ happy girl ’ who dreamed of going to university and travelling the world			2
@entity8 co-pilot - 28 - year - old @entity45 @entity44 ( above ) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to ' destroy the plane ' , it has been revealed these are some of the @entity45 pupils who died on the @entity8 flight , which crashed in the @entity31 , killing all 150 passengers			1
the teenagers had been on a week - long exchange trip to @entity6 and were flying home ‘ she had been sending me messages on @entity92 and @entity93 and had been very happy about the trip			1
she had had a good time			2
’ @entity73 ’s best friend and classmate @entity96 said			2
‘ she sent me pictures of the group together and the different sights they saw			2
they looked like they had had fun			0
’ investigators have since revealed how the 28 - year - old pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit in the moments before the aircraft was downed			1
the chilling final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by @entity35 prosecutors who said @entity44 's sole aim was to ' destroy the plane '			1
' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something			1
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane			1
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily			0
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit			0
' his ( @entity44 's ) breath was not of somebody who was struggling			0
he never said a single word			0
it was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes			0

then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door			0
' the door is reinforced according to international standards			0
' just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact			0
it 's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact			2
' there is no distress signal or @entity167 signal			0
no answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower			0
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds			0
' the intention was to destroy the plane			2
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )			2
