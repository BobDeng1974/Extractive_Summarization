when chef @entity1 was called to see his 18 - year - old son lying in a hospital bed paralysed , he made him a promise that all the doctors advised against , he said he would fix it			1
but now mr @entity1 , who can name @entity7 and @entity8 among his friends , may be one step closer to realising the dream for his son			1
a foundation set up by the chef to support spinal research has just funded pioneering surgery to enable @entity17 , a @entity18 firefighter who was paralysed after he spinal cord was severed when he was stabbed , to walk again			1
the surgery - hailed as world first hailed more impressive than putting a @entity21 - could mean that spinal injuries previously deemed incurable could be cured and people left paralysed , like mr @entity1 ' son , could one day walk again			1
( @entity33 ) : @entity7 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity1 and @entity41 @entity17 ( right ) was completely paralysed from the waist down and is now able to walk again after surgery @entity44 has not walked for the last ten years after he hit his head on a sandbank while swimming in the sea off @entity29 in @entity48 in 2003 during what was meant to be a celebration after finishing his exams			1
the accident severed his spinal cord and left him with a broken neck , meaning since then he has been unable to walk or feel his legs			2
he also has limited movement in his arms			0
his father told @entity59 : ' it was the most devastating thing in my life , seeing a fit , healthy , lean , good looking 18 year old boy in bed unable to move			1
' against the advice of doctors who criticised him for giving the teenager false dreams , mr @entity1 promised his son he would find a solution			1
mr @entity1 , a former chef , set up the @entity32 to fund research into spinal cord injuries @entity44 pictured with his girlfriend @entity73 , @entity27 had become paralysed after the accident in @entity48 the 40 - year - old fireman from @entity18 was paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago leaving him paralysed below the waist the former chef set up the @entity32 and managed to raise £ 1m by producing a cookery book with the help of celebrity chefs including @entity82 and @entity7			1
he set up the foundation to raise funds exclusively for basic medical research in the hope that a way of treating spinal injuries could be found			2
he met @entity89 , of @entity90 , who had previously managed to reverse paralysis in rats by transplant cells from the nose to their spines			1
this graphic shows the steps making up the procedure , which allowed mr @entity17 to walk again			1
scientists transplanted olffactory ensheathing cells into the damaged part of the spinal chord , to grown new nerve cells scientists from @entity90 ( @entity90 ) pioneered the breakthrough procedure			0
it was designed to enable @entity17 to walk again , after his spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago , leaving him paralysed below the waist			1
the procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or @entity114 – from the nose to the spinal cord			0
@entity117 assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain			0
the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord , using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury			0
a small piece of nerve tissue , which was taken from the ankle , was grafted onto the ' gap ' in the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend , as guided by the @entity117			0
this enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together – something that was previously thought to be impossible			0
three months after the operation , mr @entity17 began to gain muscle in his left leg and regained sensations in it , such as hot and cold , and pins and needes			1
a year later , he is able to walk again , with the aid of parallel bars			2
mr @entity1 was alerted to the research going on in @entity18 by @entity148 and decided to use the money to find a trial led by @entity151 , a @entity18 neurosurgeon			1
he said the success has left him hopeful for the future			2
@entity27 has not benefitted from the foundation but if a cure is developed in future based on the trial , mr @entity1 hopes his son will be ' near the front of the queue			1
' mr @entity17 , 38 , had been paralysed after he was stabbed in 2010 leaving him with severed spinal nerves			1
he had suffered damage similar to that of actor @entity164 , whose spine was severed from his skull after he fell off a horse in 1995			0
while some victims of partial spinal injury have recovered , a complete break was generally assumed to be irreparable			0
his condition had not improved after six months of physiotherapy and he was put forward as a candidate for the trial			2
the team worked with mr @entity17 and removed cells from his nose , which communicate with the brain			1
the procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or @entity114 – from the nose to the spinal cord			0
@entity117 assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain			0
two weeks later , the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord , using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury			0
a small piece of nerve tissue , which was taken from the ankle , was grafted onto the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend , as guided by the @entity117			0
this enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together across the ' gap ' – something that was previously thought to be impossible			0
a few months later mr @entity17 started developing muscle and sensation in his legs			1
two years later he is able to walk outside the rehabilitation centre in @entity207 with the aid of a frame and can drive a car			1
professor @entity89 said : ‘ the observed wisdom is that the central nervous system can not regenerate damaged connections			0
i ’ve never believed that			0
’ he stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond ‘ plasticity ’ – the re-wiring of the remaining connections			0
he compared that method to motorists finding other routes around a closed section of motorway , adding : ‘ what we ’re doing is repairing the motorway			0
’ speaking on @entity228 's @entity227 , professor @entity89 said : ' this [ procedure ] opens the door , which i had always been knocking at - to see that our nervous system has the ability to repair itself			2
‘ this is the beginning of a repair for spinal injuries and other types of injuries - including stroke			2
‘ the idea that the nervous system can repair itself in rats and in one man - there ’s no reason to restrict this to just the spinal cord			2
it opens the door to a future which is terrifyingly large			2
‘ we ’ve climbed two mountains and we are now at the foot of the ( next ) mountain			0
we have knowledge which could be of great value , we ca n’t stop now			0
' while the trial will need to be repeated with other patients and could take up to ten years before it becomes an accepted therapy , mr @entity1 is hopeful for the help it could offer his son			1
the procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or @entity114 – from the nose to the spinal cord where they allowed nerve cells to regrow and bridge the ' gap ' in the severed spinal cord professor @entity89 had met mr @entity1 and told him about the trial in @entity18 to treat paralysis he added : ' when you realise you could be on the verge of realising your ambition , that 's unique			1
' we must never be arrogant or cocky about what we 've done , but it 's quite remarkable			2
' professor @entity89 , whose team at @entity90 first discovered the technique , said : ‘ we believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which , as it is further developed , will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury			0
’ he described mr @entity17 ’s recovery as ‘ more impressive than man walking on the @entity291 ’			1
professor @entity89 , whose work is also published in the journal @entity294 today , said : ‘ [ mr @entity17 ] can get around with a walker and he ’s been able to resume much of his original life , including driving a car			1
' he ’s not dancing , but he ’s absolutely delighted			0
’ he continued : ‘ the number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous			2
' there are millions of them in the world			0
if we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed			0
’ dr @entity307 , of the @entity308 in @entity18 , said : ‘ we estimated that without this treatment , our patient ’s recovery chances were less than 1 per cent			1
' however , we observed a gradual recovery of both sensory and motor function that began four months after the surgery			0
’ the scientists hope to treat up to 10 patients in the next few years if they can secure funding			2
the research , funded by the @entity32 and @entity321 @entity320 , will be featured in a @entity323 programme on @entity324 tonight .			1

@entity1 set up the @entity32 to fund research
set up *charity* after 18 - year - old son @entity27 paralysed in swimming accident
raised £ 1m and used to fund a trial to reverse paralysis in @entity207 , @entity18
@entity17 was one of first patients and is now walking with aid of frame
mr @entity17 , a former fireman , was paralysed in 2010 after he was stabbed
chef mr @entity1 said treatment is ' quite remarkable ' and hopeful for future
