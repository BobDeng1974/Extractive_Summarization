one of her assistants , @entity57 , 33 , a weight - lifter and wanted criminal , later confessed and was jailed for 13 years but passing a verdict of unlawful killing , coroner dr @entity55 called into question the findings of the investigations in @entity1			0
crime : her caretaker @entity57 admitted killing her and setting fire to her body but her daughter believes the police were also involved she said that while she was satisfied @entity57 was ‘ at least partly responsible ’ inconsistencies in evidence supported the family 's belief ‘ others might have been involved			1
’ dr @entity55 highlighted how examinations carried out in the @entity6 on the victim ’s remains by a forensic anthropologist showed mrs @entity12 had died as a result of a ‘ multitude of skull fractures ’ in a ‘ frenzied physical assault ’ which conflicted with @entity57 's evidence that a punch to the face and single blow to the head had killed her			1
‘ it leaves uncomfortable concerns , ’ she said			0
the coroner said she was concerned @entity93 , who it is believed was pensioned off from the @entity54 force as questions over the death began emerging , was never questioned by @entity1 investigators			2
@entity39 , mrs @entity12 ’s daughter , told the inquest how the policeman had been responsible for a ‘ @entity105 ’ style attack on her and her mother at the sanctuary in 2002			1
a dispute over a rescue dog had grown , she said , so that at one point the officer had attacked her mother in the courtyard and then turned on ms @entity39 when she tried to photograph the assault			0
she said her head was ‘ smashed ’ against the wall and @entity93 then hit her repeatedly with his baton			0
' i crumpled into a heap and he began raining blows on me with his baton - an @entity120 baton designed to break bones , ’ she said			0
' i turned my head and looked at his face and his eyes were that of somebody taking great pleasure in what he was doing			0
‘ i thought i was going to die			0
' @entity12 pictured in @entity129 ( left )			1
the 65 - year - old disappeared in september 2008 from her home in @entity54 , near @entity132 in @entity1			1
caretaker @entity57 admitted killing the former model and socialite horrific crime : ms @entity12 was murdered at her animal sanctuary in september 2008 near @entity54 , 65 - miles from @entity132			1
her body was dismembered and burnt star : @entity12 being chased by the press in @entity37 at the height of her fame in the 1960s eventually , mrs @entity12 calmed him , she recalled , but not before he had ‘ crushed like a pancake ’ a grey kitten with his foot that had been beside her head			1
with the support of @entity151 , ms @entity39 , from @entity152 , @entity153 , and her mother successfully took court action against @entity93 but pressure from the authorities meant a series of further trials with the final one set for the month after ms @entity12 was murdered			1
ms @entity22 , whose work on mine clearance was recognised with the @entity163 in 1997 , said @entity93 had threatened to have her sister killed as legal proceedings continued between them over the attack			0
conspiracy : ms @entity12 ' sister @entity22 believes that the @entity1 authorities covered up the investigation to protect a local police officer she said : ‘ she told me her life had been endangered			1
she had received phone calls and dead animals thrown into her house and locals were being nasty ... ‘ she said to me she was frightened of him and genuinely her life was in danger			2
‘ @entity93 had said to her “ i will get you eliminated "			0
’ the former beauty queen 's sister raised the alarm on september 18 , phoning the @entity1 police from her home in @entity186 , @entity187 , saying mrs @entity12 was missing			1
the next day , ms @entity22 arrived at sanctuary to find the boss of another animal sanctuary taking the animals and her sister 's office ransacked and a laptop stolen			1
she claimed she reported a robbery and her sister 's disappearance but the police did not want to know			2
a few weeks later she paid for cadaver search dogs to look around the grounds			0
all three found blood traces inside her @entity201 but the police failed to impound the vehicle			2
worried that a cover up was under way , she moved the vehicle to a house ms @entity39 owned but it disappeared , the inquest heard			2
the charred remains of her sister were found partially buried in the sanctuary ’s grounds after they had been moved in a wheelbarrow from the fire by @entity57 , who then telephoned sex chat lines			2
dr @entity55 said she found both ms @entity39 and her aunt to ‘ be credible and compelling witnesses			2
’ the cats and dogs sanctuary was funded partly by donations from animal lovers in @entity223 and a gift from @entity14 the battered body of @entity12 was found in woods near her home ( pictured ) near @entity54 , 65 - miles from @entity132 she continued : ‘ i accept the evidence of @entity39 that this man had previously seriously assaulted her on the sanctuary premises in a manner which would appear strikingly similar to the attack which later took her mother 's life			1
‘ i am concerned that this man never appears to have been questioned in relation to @entity12 's death			1
’ foreign secretary @entity239 has twice written to the @entity1 authorities asking them to hand over details of their inquiries so @entity3 can review the case but they have steadfastly refused			2
now the family believe the inquest and dr @entity55 ’s findings provide a compelling reason for @entity3 to be invited to carry out a new investigation			2
ms @entity22 said : ‘ the verdict completely contradicts the findings of the @entity1 court			0
' this is because it was built on lies and the story of the murderer which is now completely crushed			0
‘ it has been five years of @entity1 cover - ups and heartache seeking truth and justice			0
there is now a clear case for an independent investigation by @entity3			0
beauty : ms @entity12 was a successful model and actress before moving to @entity1 to look after animals ‘ ironically , @entity272 , the prime minister of hungary , was in @entity37 giving a speech on @entity274 , as the inquest took place			1
surely truth , justice and transparency should be high among them			0
‘ prime minister now is the time that you act upon what you are preaching at this moment			0
' i would like to see @entity15 interrogated and brought to justice			0
' mrs @entity12 , whose family left @entity1 in the late 1956 , rose to fame as a model and actress in @entity37 in the 1960s			1
her stunning looks and skill as a model and actress attracted the attention of @entity13 and @entity14 , who were looking for an actress to star in a film they were making called rape , about the intrusion of the camera in everyday life			0
she married @entity6 architect @entity304			0
the couple later divorced and she established the sanctuary in 1997 using £ 150,000 of her own money			2
