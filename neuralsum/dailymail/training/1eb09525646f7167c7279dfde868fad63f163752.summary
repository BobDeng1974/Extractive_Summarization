' @entity0 was prepared to respond to questions with gestures and indicated that he will knockout @entity11 in one or two rounds at the @entity33 in @entity13 's @entity34 on november 29			1

sometimes @entity0 is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself			1
' the irony , of course , is that this impersonation of @entity79 will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto			0
@entity46 once taped his mouth shut but only kept up the appearance for a matter of minutes @entity11 will take on @entity0 in six weeks and promised to knock the silent fighter out @entity0 was fined £ 15,000 for his four - letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year @entity11 was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that @entity0 was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage , he said simply : ' i will knock him out			1
