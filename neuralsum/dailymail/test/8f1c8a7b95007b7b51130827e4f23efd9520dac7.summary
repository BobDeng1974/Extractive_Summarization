all the smiles can not hide the reality that @entity2 and his union are a potent , sinister force in @entity6 politics out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in @entity9 , the trade union firebrand 's manner was as warm as the weather			1
' did n't you once call me a slab - faced @entity15 ? ' the famously militant leader of @entity17 asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing			0
i had to confess i had			0
but that did not stop ' @entity20 ' @entity2 giving me the time of day on a street in @entity23 as he conducted a two - day tour of the @entity25 to drum up support for @entity28 's cause			1
watching him in action , it was clear that he is highly popular with activists			0
his gospel of traditional hard - left socialism goes down well with the converted , as does his hackneyed @entity35 bile			0
' we look to @entity37 as a beacon of hope to show what a @entity28 government can do			2
the @entity42 might have the money but we 've got the working people on our side , ' he said to cheers and applause			0
yet all the smiles can not hide the reality that @entity2 and his union are a potent , sinister force in @entity6 politics , seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the @entity28 movement to drag @entity6 back to the dark days of the 1970s			1
as the @entity59 reveals today , the sheer scale of the influence @entity17 holds on scores of @entity28 candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose			1
indeed , @entity2 , a former @entity64 dock worker who keeps a drawing of @entity66 in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss , is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom : ' we are supposed to believe that the @entity74 was a horrible time			0
it was a time of great advances for working people , ' he has said			0
@entity28 's umbilical link to @entity2 's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left - wing , anti-austerity @entity84 , yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country			1
not only is @entity17 – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the @entity28 's structure , mps and finances , but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past , including a major expansion in the public sector , less flexibility in the workplace , higher taxation and ever more state spending			1
just like @entity100 , @entity2 wants to make @entity28 bolder , ' more radical , courageous and brave '			2
only last month , he appeared to threaten illegal action if a @entity42 @entity102 pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector			0
' when the law is misguided , when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms , can we respect it ? i am not really posing the question , i 'm giving the answer			0
it ai n't going to happen , ' he declared			0
despite all his talk about the oppression of working people , however , he has not done badly for himself			0
last year it was revealed he received a £ 5,000 rise , taking his pay and pensions package to £ 140,281			0
@entity2 has denied that he has too much influence over @entity124 , adding that @entity17 is supporting the party ' 100 per cent ' @entity2 's determination to influence @entity28 was all too evident in @entity37			1
with an air of quasi-regal grandeur , he visited several factories , gave talks to @entity28 activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in @entity134 at the statute of that old champagne socialist @entity136			1
when i spoke to @entity2 , he downplayed his hardline socialism , instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy			0
and he denied that he had too much influence over @entity124 's party : ' if only that were true , ' he said , while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause			1
' @entity17 is supporting @entity28 100 per cent , ' he said , adding that is now campaigning ' all over the country '			2
yet there was something synthetic about @entity2 's protestations of support for @entity28			1
as i watched him at close quarters , it became more apparent that he was going through the motions			0
when asked in an interview with @entity37 about @entity124 's leadership , @entity2 could say only : ' he 's doing ok '			1
beneath the surface , i have no doubt he longs to hear @entity124 offering more nakedly socialist policies , rather than trying to appeal to @entity163			1
moreover , if @entity28 and @entity17 really think that @entity2 is an asset in the election , they are doing their best to keep quiet about it			2
when i tried to find out @entity2 's schedule for his @entity170 visit from any number of @entity17 and @entity28 sources , including @entity2 's own press officer , i was greeted with either hostility or silence			2
no one would give me any information			0
it was only through persistence and good luck that i managed to track him down , to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally : ' how did you find us ? did you fit a tracking device to @entity2 's car ? ' that kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence			2
it reveals a fear that , just as with @entity100 's spendthrift radicalism , the hard - left dogma of @entity17 is likely to alienate floating middle - of - the - road voters			2
such fears are , of course , only too justified			0
for this is no small - town demagogue			0
on the contrary , @entity2 is pivotal to @entity28 's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party			1
it was unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured @entity124 was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother @entity208 , who enjoyed greater popularity among @entity210 and the rank and file			2
since 2010 , @entity17 is estimated to have donated at least £ 14.4million to @entity28 's coffers			1
it was @entity17 and the other affiliated unions that ensured @entity124 ( pictured left ) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother @entity208 ( right ) the dominance of @entity17 runs right through @entity28 's organisation , with huge implications for the make - up of a putative @entity124 government			1
one recent analysis showed that 159 @entity210 from the last parliament receive sponsorship from @entity17 or are members of the union , including senior frontbenchers such as @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
in addition , 133 @entity28 candidates at this election are reported to have links to @entity17			2
as @entity236 , chairman of @entity17 's political committee and a member of @entity28 's @entity239 recently admitted , the union is involved in a ' serious attempt to win back the party '			1
tragically for @entity6 , there is now a real danger that an incoming @entity28 government would be forced to lurch even further to the @entity245 , not just by @entity84 by also by @entity17 , with @entity124 too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in @entity247 .			1

the scale of influence unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose
it remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of @entity6 's past
