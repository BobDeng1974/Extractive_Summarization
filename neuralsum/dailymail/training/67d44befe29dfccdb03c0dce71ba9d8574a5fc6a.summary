even the greatest stage needs a memorable performance to bring it alive and @entity2 delivered an award - winning one on saturday to produce the most thrilling and emotional victory of the @entity6 season on @entity7 at @entity8			1
two years after the great @entity9 had ended his career with victory in the @entity12 for the late sir @entity13 , his little brother , trained by @entity13 ’s widow @entity14 , lifted the same @entity16 prize			1
for a few strides well inside the furlong , it looked as if jockey @entity21 ’s efforts to make all the running would be in vain as @entity2 was headed by @entity24 but the 7 - 1 shot refused to buckle as he bravely thrust his head back in front			1
jockey @entity21 celebrates after winning the @entity12 at @entity8 the cold nuts and bolts of the result are that @entity2 ’s neck success bagged over £ 770,000 for @entity33 ’s stable , more than twice the total managed by the rest of her horses in @entity36 this season			1
but this was about much , much more			2
it was an emotional and overwhelming justification of @entity33 ’s decision to continue to run her husband ’s @entity42 stables in @entity44			1
to suggest a little intervention from above helped lift home the horse he used to train may be overly sentimental but if sir @entity13 was looking down on the corner of @entity52 he ruled as a trainer , he would have no doubt done so with contented smile			0
@entity33 , struggling to hold back the tears , said : ‘ i think i am going to wake up and realise that i ’ve been dreaming			1
i was interviewed before the race , which i did n’t really want to do , and i said it would be a fairytale to win and it absolutely is			0
@entity33 was close to tears after @entity2 's victory on @entity7 at @entity8 ‘ we knew he was in the form of his life but we hardly dared to dream it could happen			1
it was a tough race and he toughed it out			0
‘ i had my head in my hands			0
i was so scared he was n’t going to hang on			0
’ racing can seem obsessed with making sure it does n’t accentuate the positive			0
it happened again ahead of @entity7 at @entity8			1
the ground was heavy , not ideal for horses bred to run like the wind , but the going has seemed even tougher for the meeting ’s organisers			0
as high - profile names headed by dual @entity84 winner @entity81 joined the list of absentees , a familiar question surfaced			0
is a saturday in late october the right stage for the most valuable day ’s flat racing in @entity36 ? given a blank piece of paper , @entity89 would choose a different day but @entity36 racing ’s major meetings must be arranged in conjunction with other @entity96 nations , who can veto anything they believe would have an adverse effect on their programmes			1
that means moving @entity104 is a non-runner			0
but what we are stuck with is not bad			0
almost 30,000 spectators were at @entity8 to watch 17 @entity16 winners			1
sure , more needs to be done — @entity8 and @entity89 must see if there is a way to cover the track to shield it from the worst of the autumn weather			1
@entity114 sir @entity13 used to raise the family standard above @entity42 whenever he had a @entity16 winner and it will be flying proudly again this morning as his widow maintains the tradition			2
@entity33 , who took over the trainer ’s licence when sir @entity13 died shortly before 2013 @entity8 , certainly has reason to treasure @entity2			1
@entity33 ’s first full year in charge has not been easy but @entity2 has also won two other overseas @entity16 prizes — the @entity126 in @entity127 and the @entity129 de @entity128 in @entity130			1
what the five - year - old now does has yet to be decided by owner @entity133 but it will be a big surprise if he does not join @entity9 at stud			2
@entity21 appeared to execute a perfectly timed ride to hold off @entity137 ’s @entity24 — a horse he usually rides			0
but there was a sting in the tail			0
he received a £ 10,000 fine and a seven - day ban for using his whip above the permitted level			2
@entity146 was @entity148 ’s @entity147 , while 7 - 4 favourite @entity149 was fifth			0
@entity2 ’s win gave @entity36 champions day the big result it needs and one that the @entity154 was unable to supply			2
the 2013 @entity126 winner could not cope with the heavy ground and trailed in last in the @entity157 behind @entity159 ’s @entity158			0
the £ 240,000 @entity161 ’s second place in the @entity162 should be more than enough to secure @entity163 a first trainers ’ title in his first season since taking over from his father. , half - length winner was @entity169 , ridden by @entity170 and trained by @entity171 , whose sister landed the @entity173 a fortnight ago with @entity174 .			2
