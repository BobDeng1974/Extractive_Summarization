by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's supposed to be the happiest holiday of your life â€“ when you and your loved one have a wonderful time and want to share your good times with friends and family and recently thanks to social media the world at large			0
at least that is what a @entity14 woman thought when she posted photographs of her honeymoon on her @entity19 page			1
following a marital row her husband demanded that the photographs be taken down because he had not given his permission and even took his wife to court to force the issue			1
the pictures were taken on the couple 's honeymoon 10 years ago and included photos of the pair cuddling and kissing			0
in her defence , the wife 's lawyer claimed that ' the use of social networks is now so advanced that we can consider a @entity19 wall to be not unlike a private photo album '			1
to her horror the court found that the publication of a photo on the internet is ' significantly worse ' than any other form of publication because privacy can not be guaranteed by the user			2
the court in @entity14 ( above ) found for the husband and now he may receive damages from his wife ( file photo ) the court found that the woman had broken @entity63 of the civil code and ' certainly violated the right to privacy of her husband '			0
she also fell foul of legislation from 1941 which says that the portrait of a person can not be displayed , reproduced or sold without the subject 's consent			0
the decision was welcomed by the husband 's lawyer , @entity75 , who said : ' it 's an unprecedented decision , which will provide a point of reference for @entity19 users			2

after a row , he demanded she take down the 10 **-** year **-** old photographs
her lawyer said @entity19 was ' not unlike a private photo album '
*neapolitan* court *disagreed* and may order her to pay him *compensation*
