it is a war that has been raging since the beginning of agriculture , but now farmers have a new weapon in the battle to keep birds from eating their crops - laser shooting robots			1
farmers in @entity9 have been trialling a new type of scarecrow that fires green laser beams across fields to keep birds away from crops			1
the system , called @entity17 , uses an automated robot that can be programmed to sweep lasers at random across areas ranging from 200 acres to more than 3,000 acres			1
most farmers combine these loud noises , usually from propane canons or firecrackers , with traditional scarecrows that mimic the shape of humans , to keep birds away from their crops			2
it appears the @entity48 are at the cutting edge of zany uses for laser technology			1
rail company @entity52 is fitting powerful lasers under two of its trains in a trial to beat the problem of leaves on the line			2
it is working with researchers at @entity61 to use lasers mounted in front of the train wheels to vapourise leaves that are compacted onto railway tracks to leave a slippery @entity67 - like surface			2
left untreated this can double stopping distances and make it hard for trains to restart			0
they have tested the lasers successfully at speeds of up to 50mph and hope it could eventually make the old excuse of leaves on the line for delays a thing of the past			2
however , the new device , developed by @entity48 bird control researchers at the @entity83 , in @entity84 , @entity9 , chases birds away with no noise			1
@entity87 recently approved handheld versions of the laser and it has been used on farms in @entity91 and have been used to scare away seagulls in @entity93			0
the automatic version of the lasers have yet to be used here in the @entity97			0
the trajectory of the lasers can be programmed from a laptop and it then makes random sweeps across fields			1
tests at an apple and pear orchard saw losses due to birds almost entirely disappear over a three week period , according to @entity109 , the farmer who has been trialing the system			1
he said : ' after the deployment of the laser , the orchard became a lot quieter			1
the large groups of crows disappeared			0
' the system is noiseless and the birds do not seem to get used to the laser beam			1
the installation was easy and it requires no maintenance			0
' depending on the crops , losses due to birds can range between five per cent and 50 per cent of what is planted			0
the laser is fired from a robotic system mounted on top of a tower to provide maximum coverage of a field scary : the random movement of the green laser frightens birds away from crops the developers of the robotic laser , which looks a little like a @entity138 camera and can be mounted on top of a tower to provide maximum coverage			1
researchers at the @entity83 ( @entity142 ) also hope the system can be used to keep birds away airports , where they pose a risk to aircraft , and oil rigs			0
the laser 's trajectory can be programmed using a laptop to ensure it says within field boundaries @entity154 , director of @entity142 , said : ' the damage caused in the fruit industry by birds is well known and seems to be increasing			1
' it can lead to substantial reduction in production			0
the smallest hole in a pear means it can rot and infect the whole crate			0
' we 've been looking for different methods of chasing the birds away with as little disturbance as possible			0
' we had heard about the handheld lasers , which are like a torch which people carry around to scare off birds			2
' but now that has been put on a robot that has a pre-programmed field in which it will move , so you can set it up to protect part or all of the orchard			1
' mr @entity154 added that the system worked by creating the impression of movement on the field , which scares the birds away without harming them			1
he said : ' they do n't understand the light			0
' they consider it a physical object moving through the trees which they ca n't hear but they can see			0
' we tested it on crows - jackdaws and rooks - and they were all scared away			0
they tend to be the smartest birds so if it works on them it should work on other birds			2
' the system is random so there is no pattern they can discern			0
' however , the laser may create some unwanted light shows in rural areas that may be opposed by some locals			2
mr @entity154 added : ' it is only during the few weeks that the fruit is ripe on the trees			0
' in a densely populated country like the @entity48 there is already much light pollution so it probably will not lead to many complaints			1
' anything would be an improvement on the traditional way of chasing birds - a cannon that makes a loud boom			0
' 24 - hour operation : once programmed , the robotic laser , pictured , can be left to scare birds away through the day and night while fruit ripens			2
it is hoped the device will save farmers a great deal of money the laser is mounted on top of a tower to ensure it can cover an entire field of up to 3,000 acres			1

the lasers sweep at random across an area from 200 acres to 3,000 acres
robot fires intense beams of green light from on top of a tower across field
laser works by creating movement in the field that birds can not *identify*
