by @entity1 reporter published : 22:50 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 10 september 2012 the @entity2 says its more than 26,000 teachers and support staff will go on strike on monday for the first time in 25 years			1
the union says contract talks with the district failed late sunday night over issues including benefits and job security			1
' we will be on the ( picket ) line , ' @entity2 president @entity16 said sunday night , calling it a difficult decision and one the union hoped could be avoided			1
school board president @entity32 announced a short time earlier that talks had broken off despite the school board offering what he called a fair and responsible contract that would cover four years and cost the city $ 400 million			1
@entity40 said she believed talks would resume monday but a time had not been set for the sides to meet			2
she added that progress had been made but not enough to avert a strike			0
the city has a contingency plan should the strike go forward , with 144 public schools open to students from 8.30am to 12.30pm , @entity47 reports			0
failure : a man delivers armfuls of the signs on saturday should they fail to reach an agreement over teachers ' contracts with @entity60 , which they did on sunday call to arms : hundreds of signs reading on strike lay stockpiled in a store room of the @entity2 strike headquarters on saturday , two days before the members plan to strike regular school transportation is not being made available with parents holding that responsibility , as well as their registration on the district 's website			1
the strike was announced after months of tense , at - times heated talks between the city and the union representing 25,500 public school teachers			1
the district , the third largest in the @entity80 , had been offering a raise of 2 per cent a year for four years			0
the union called that offer unacceptable - particularly after mayor @entity82 last year cancelled a previously negotiated 4 per cent pay raise , citing budget problems			1
the union countered by asking for a 30 per cent pay raise over two years , followed by a request for a 25 per cent increase over two years			0
just weeks ago , @entity40 told delegates the union had adjusted its demand and was asking for a 19 per cent pay raise in the contract 's first year			2
lining up : members of community group parents 4 teachers display pro-teacher posters outside @entity98 on friday helping hand : a mother rushes to help a young boy hold up a sign on friday expressing his support for the city 's teachers rally : a woman holds a union sign in @entity109 amid rallying calls toward an agreement that was unsuccessful by sunday night the union also has raised concerns about raises based on teacher experience and education			1
it said the district agreed to retain contract language allowing raises based on experience , called step increases , but would not actually pay the money now			0
teachers also have been concerned about new teacher evaluations , health benefits and regaining lost jobs			2
an additional issue was how a longer school day for students is being implemented			0
the threatened strike is the latest chapter in a very public and often contentious battle between the mayor and the union			2
when he took office last year , the former @entity137 chief of staff inherited a school district facing a $ 700 million budget shortfall			1
not long after , his administration rescinded 4 per cent raises for teachers			0
he then asked the union to re-open its contract and accept 2 per cent pay raises in exchange for lengthening the school day for students by 90 minutes			0
monumental : the strike will be the first one the city of @entity151 has had in the last 25 years lack of : two young children are seen eating pizza as their parents organize strike signage on saturday , affected by a $ 700 million budget shortfall the longer school day was one of the mayor 's campaign promises for the city 's schools , and he pushed to have it implemented a year ahead of schedule			1
he attempted to go around the union by asking teachers at individual schools to waive the contract and add 90 minutes to the day			0
he halted the effort after being challenged by the union before the @entity170			0
the district and union agreed in july on how to implement the longer school day , striking a deal to hire back 477 teachers who had been laid off rather than pay regular teachers more to work longer hours			2
that raised hopes the contract dispute would be settled soon , but bargaining continued on the other issues .			0

talks between the teachers union and district over issues including benefits and job security were failed to be met by sunday night
