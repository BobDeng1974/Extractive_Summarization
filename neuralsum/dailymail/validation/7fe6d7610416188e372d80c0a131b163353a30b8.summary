@entity1 captain @entity0 is ' devastated ' after his side ended up being @entity4 runners - up at the weekend			1
the @entity6 openside was understandably disappointed not to get his hands on the trophy after an extraordinary final day as the @entity9 fell six points short of the required total , despite beating @entity12 55 - 35 at @entity13 on saturday evening			1
instead it was @entity15 who retained the title , with their 40 - 10 triumph over @entity19 enough to overhaul a tough target set by @entity21 with their 61 - 20 win over @entity23 on what is already being touted as the greatest day in the competition 's history			1

we want to be champions			0
but to score 50 points against @entity12 , considering they had only conceded two tries all tournament , was a great scoreline and really showed our intent			2
