by @entity0 drug mules @entity1 and @entity3 have been offered the chance of freedom by @entity6 – if they help bring down the drugs gang behind the £ 1.5 million cocaine haul they were caught trying to smuggle out of @entity10			1
and last night , faced with the alternative of 15 years behind bars , they were considering what to do			2
in an emotional phone call to her mother @entity16 , @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m very confused			1
above , @entity25 , left , and @entity26 , right , are escorted from a truck by police at @entity30 prison ahead of their court appearance on wednesday @entity1 called her mother during a fundraising event in her name on friday night			1
bursting in to tears , @entity16 told people at @entity38 in @entity39 : ‘ thank you so much			2
your support keeps us strong			2
’ but the girls have been warned that a citation document , seen exclusively by @entity45 , contains a raft of damning texts , calls , money transfers and photos that do nothing to support the claim they were coerced into smuggling by armed @entity55 mafia who kidnapped them in @entity58			2
during a fundraising event in @entity39 on friday night , @entity25 's mother @entity16 ( pictured ) told people : ' thank you so much			0
your support keeps us strong ' they have now been told that if they admit they fabricated the story and agree to stop shielding the criminals and collaborate in bringing them down , they could be out of prison in two months			0
‘ they hold their whole future in their hands , ’ said dr @entity68 , head of the state attorney ’s anti-drugs unit ahead of a hearing on tuesday			0
‘ this is going to be their last chance to get an early termination on their sentence and by - pass a trial			1
' they have the option of collaborating with the state prosecution or saying nothing and going to jail for a very long time			0
' there is a possibility these two women can be out of prison in around two months but they simply ca n’t plead guilty and say they were forced			0
‘ they need to go into detail about who these other men involved are – what they look like and where we can find them			0
the evidence that we have is overwhelming and they do n’t have anything to suggest they were forced			0
’ @entity1 , from @entity101 near @entity102 , and @entity3 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , both 20 , confessed last week to drug smuggling			1
but they still insisted they were coerced and their defence strategy failed when prosecutors got the sentencing hearing cancelled			0
media frenzy : an enormous group of cameras and reporters were there to meet the pair as they arrived for their first court appearance earlier this summer @entity1 ’s parents , energy company manager @entity119 , 54 , and @entity121 administrator @entity16 , 53 , have encouraged their daughter to plead guilty , but say they believe she was forced to carry drugs through @entity126 ’s @entity125 airport			1
a source close to the case said : ‘ if @entity1 and @entity3 do know more than they are letting on , then they face an agonising decision			1
' snitching on an international drugs gang obviously carries its risks , but spending some of the most important years of your life in a hellhole jail thousands of miles from home ca n’t be very pleasant either			1

drug mules @entity1 and @entity3 have been offered the chance of freedom by @entity6
however , they must help bring down the drugs gang which gave them £ 1.5million of cocaine
the pair , both 20 , were arrested in @entity126 last month
