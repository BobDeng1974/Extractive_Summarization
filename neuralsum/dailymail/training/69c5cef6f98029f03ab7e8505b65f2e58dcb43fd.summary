by @entity0 brave : @entity2 suffers from a rare skin condition which means any form of anxiety can lead to her breaking out in large spots for most schoolchildren , slipping up in the playground can cause the odd graze and a bit of embarrassment			1
but for @entity2 , any form of anxiety could trigger a head - to - toe rash - and leave her entire body covered in scabs			1
the six - year - old suffers from an extremely rare skin condition called @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
any form of emotional or environmental stress triggers a flare up , causing thickening of the skin and blistering			1
in the past , the only part of her body that has n't been affected is the tip of her nose			2
@entity2 's condition is so extreme that people often stop and stare at her in the street during a flare - up			1
her mother @entity35 , 42 , said : ' if she 's anxious or gets upset , or even if it 's just too cold , she comes out in big red blotches			0
' within seconds , her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots , and they wo n't go away until she calms down			1
' it 's events that trigger it , so if she falls over in the supermarket or if someone says something she 's not sure about			2
' only the other day , one of her friends asked her to come and play			0
but because she did n't know what to say , it sparked a break out			0
' ' depending on the flare up , i will give her antihistamines , but generally a cuddle with her mum will help her to calm down			0
' @entity2 's condition is caused by her body producing too many ' mast cells '			1
these are blood cells formed in the bone marrow to help fight off infection and illness			0
mrs @entity2 , a learning mentor , and her husband @entity66 , 40 , a lorry driver , first noticed something was wrong when @entity2 was born			1
battle : @entity2 as a baby			1
her condition , called @entity19 ( @entity71 ) , means any form of emotional or environmental stress trigger a flare up anxiety : ' within seconds , her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots , and they wo n't go away until she calms down , ' says @entity2 's mother , @entity35 ' we spotted a hive on the middle finger of her right hand , ' said mrs @entity2			1
' we asked the midwife about it but she said it was nothing - it was quite common and her skin just had to get used to the environment			2
' over the next few months the couple were given yet more reasons , such as a clothing or dog allergy			0
in the end , mrs @entity2 was so desperate for a diagnosis she took @entity98 to @entity99 and @entity100 , near the family home in @entity102 , @entity103 and pleaded with doctors to help			2
' by sheer luck there was a dermatologist there and he recognised it as a form of mastocytosis , ' she said			0
diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is an extremely rare condition			0
it is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin			0
these cells contain substances , such as histamine , that regulate allergic reactions			0
the condition is usually found in children and typically resolves itself by puberty			0
it causes thickening of the skin and agonising blisters			0
there is no cure but treatment helps most patients			0
typical treatments include taking antihistamines to prevent the effect of mast cell histamine			0
source : genetic and @entity139 @entity2 's official diagnosis of @entity19 came the following month after she was referred to a clinic in @entity142			1
despite their daughter being only one of three children in the country with the condition at the time , @entity2 's parents say they were relieved to finally have a diagnosis for her			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' when it all started and no one could tell me what the real problem was , i did a lot of my own research on the internet			2
' after about two weeks i was pretty certain it was @entity19			2
it affects 1 in 500,000 people in the @entity161 but @entity2 suffers with a rare strain of it - which meant it was harder to diagnose			1
' @entity2 , whose two - year - old sister @entity165 does not have the condition , is said to be the first infant in the @entity161 to undergo a pioneering course of ' sun bed ' treatment to blitz the disease , where she was showered in bursts of ultra-violet light			1
while the treatment has dramatically improved her skin condition , she still has behavioural swings and phobias as a result of the condition , her mother says			1
' some days it will cause her to just run away and hide - but other days she copes well with it			0
' she even shames people in the street who gawp at her by shouting " what 's that lady looking at , mummy ? " ' ' i tell her , " she 's looking at you because you 're so beautiful			0
" ' the six - year - old was told by a doctor that the rash would have a drawback , however			0
discussing her future , mrs @entity2 claims the doctor told her daughter : ' it wo n't stop her doing anything she wants to do - unless she wants to be a model			1
' recovery : since having treatment with uv light , @entity2 ( left with @entity35 , her mother and @entity165 , her sister ) has shown an improvement			1
many children grow out of the condition by the time they are teenagers but the comment upset @entity2 and her family , who have always encouraged her that her condition is nothing to be ashamed of			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' as a first time mum to a little girl , i was devastated to hear these words			2
' i would love her to get a shot at modelling			0
not a career , just a one - off thing , so that we could say " well actually she is "			0
' there is an 80 per cent chance that @entity2 will grow out of the condition by her teenage years , but either way , her mother hopes the condition wo n't hold her back from anything			1
she added : ' it 's not just a condition , it 's a place - and in the early days it was a really dark place			2
' we 've come so far , and we want people to know about the condition , so that those who suffer from it are treated no differently to anyone else			2
' the condition itself has been easier than the prejudice we have had to face			0

@entity2 has a skin condition called @entity19
any form of anxiety or embarrassment can trigger a flare - up
this causes her entire body to be covered in large pink - brown spots
she has now been treated with uv light to try and ease her reactions
