@entity80 is well behind other countries in self - building , with just 10,000 constructed every year , compared with around 60pc of all home in @entity85 @entity84 and @entity86			2

’ the policy , which will be announced at an event on tuesday , is not just for the well - off , he said			0
‘ @entity26 makes it seem like self - build is for retired people or people who want to build an amazing house out of goat hair ’ , he said			2
