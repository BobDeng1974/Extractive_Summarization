covered in flour , they clamber from a foreign lorry – to the amazement of other motorists on a busy motorway			1
this is the moment that at least nine suspected illegal immigrants emerged from their hiding place after smuggling themselves into the @entity10			1
the gang brazenly strolled off into the @entity13 countryside			2
and although all were caught within minutes , almost half were immediately set free			2
they were even taken to a hostel , given free accommodation and told how to apply for asylum and benefits			1
any lengths : one man , watched on by his accomplice , emerges from the lorry covered in flour the graphic illustration of how @entity10 remains a soft touch for migrants occurred on the @entity27 in @entity28 this week			1
and it seems it was not a rare event			2
@entity31 say that for the past two years they have received on average one report a day relating to clandestine immigration			2
the incident happened near the junction with the @entity36 , as rush - hour traffic slowed to a crawl , and was photographed by a daily mail reader			1
the immigrants opened the hatch in the top of the @entity44 food tanker , which had apparently just arrived from @entity45 via the @entity46 and was parked on the hard shoulder of the motorway			1
they emerged one by one , then jumped down on to the ground in a shower of dust			2
several witnesses called police , while the tanker driver was also apparently on the phone to the authorities as his stowaway passengers fled			0
one caller told officers the flour - covered @entity62 fugitives would be easy to spot as they all ‘ looked like @entity64 ’			1
they were picked up within the hour at the nearby village of @entity66			0
but after @entity31 handed the nine men over to the @entity68 , four were allowed to go free			0
emerging : the immigrants emerging from the top of a @entity44 registered tanker in a layby on the @entity73 the other five remain in detention ‘ pending removal from the @entity10 ’ but may yet wage legal bids to @entity78 is believed the group had sneaked into the tanker – assumed to have been used previously for transporting flour or other foodstuffs – somewhere in @entity45 before being brought to @entity13 without the knowledge of the driver			1
lorry drivers face heavy fines for bringing illegals into the country , and the @entity68 – under fire for its failure to tackle unauthorised immigration – claims to have tightened security checks for stowaways , with specialist equipment to detect body heat or breath			1
but it seems the flow of people sneaking in continues regardless			0
the @entity101 reader who photographed the gang said : ‘ i was just near the @entity36 when i saw this @entity44 lorry on the hard shoulder			1
the driver was talking on his mobile			0
maybe he heard something inside his tanker , so stopped			0
‘ as i went past the tanker , i saw these people start coming out of the hatch on top			0
they were all covered in this white stuff that looked like flour , but seemed to be from the @entity62			0
they were a bit unshaven and shaggy			0
‘ they were not running across the fields , just walking slowly and smiling			0
i think they were happy because they managed to cross the border			0
’ last night @entity31 said : ‘ we were called at around 8.15am on tuesday by several members of the public who reported seeing a group of men getting off a lorry on the westbound @entity27 , near to where it joins the @entity36			1
the men were on foot , described as being covered in a white , flour - like powder			2
‘ officers , assisted by sightings by members of the public , arrested nine men in the @entity137 area on suspicion of entering the country illegally			0
they have been taken to @entity139 and handed over to the @entity140			0
’ the @entity68 said : ‘ @entity142 officials were contacted by @entity31 after they attended an incident on the @entity27 on tuesday			1
‘ nine men – four @entity148 , two @entity144 , an @entity145 , an @entity146 and a @entity147 – were arrested at the scene on suspicion of immigration offences			0
’ but it admitted : ‘ four of the men – two @entity148 , an @entity145 and an @entity144 – have since been released on immigration bail while their cases are considered by the @entity155			0
under fire : the fact that four of the immigrants are now being housed and expected to get benefits will see the @entity68 come in for more criticism ‘ if they are found to have no right to remain in the @entity10 they will face removal			1
the other men remain in immigration detention pending their removal from the @entity10			0
’ the @entity155 said : ‘ when suspected illegal immigrants found on lorries are arrested by police , we respond quickly			1
‘ we work closely with police to tackle illegal immigration			2
where someone is found to have no legal right to remain in the @entity10 we will take action to remove them			0
’ last night a @entity155 spokesman refused to discuss the nine arrivals in detail but suggested that the four who were set free would have been given transport to a hostel where they would be housed rent - free			2
they would be given information on how to apply for benefits for asylum seekers , which would start with cash payments of £ 36 a week , and be told to check in regularly to dissuade them from absconding again			1
the @entity155 spokesman claimed to have no figures for the number of clandestine arrivals caught in @entity28 – saying immigration control centres were in @entity45 and @entity192 , not @entity13 .			1

nine suspected illegal immigrants emerge from their hiding place - from lorry on the @entity27
four are seeking asylum - and are expected to begin to claim benefits
the @entity44 lorry had entered from @entity45
