@entity0 said consent must be considered in rape cases even if given when ' blind drunk ' a barrister has sparked fury among rape victims after insisting men should not be convicted if the woman is drunk or on drugs when sexually assaulted			1
writing in a blog post titled ' she 's gagging for it ' , @entity0 protested ' consent is consent , blind drunk or otherwise '			2
the @entity15 - based barrister added rape statistics would drop if women ' covered up and did not drink themselves legless			1
' his comments have been slammed by rape victims and support groups as ' vile '			1
spurred by the @entity24 's announcement last month that defendants must prove a a woman not only gave consent to sex but was in an able state of mind to do so , mr @entity0 said : ' i have always found it distasteful and unattractive the suggestion that as the victim was blind drunk she ( was ) therefore unable to give her consent to sex , or more to the point , she gave her consent which she would not have given had she been sober			1
' in my book , consent is consent , blind drunk or otherwise , and regret after the event can not make it rape , ' he continued the post			0
' i have a very simple solution which i hope you will agree is fair			0
if the complainant ( i do not refer to her as the victim ) was under the influence of alcohol or drugs , or both , when she was ‘ raped ’ , this provides the accused with a complete defence			0
' end of story and a victory for fairness , moderation and common sense ! ' mr @entity0 's comments were lambasted by rape victims and charities this morning			1
@entity66 , whose step - father was jailed for raping her last year , said : ' his comments are absolutely vile			2
' if a person is not in a position to consent then it is rape			0
' @entity73 is a choice , when both people involved are not in consent then it is rape			0
' the views of @entity78 , who waived her anonymity to campaign on behalf of other rape victims , were echoed by the @entity81 who described mr @entity0 's comments as ' sick '			1
mr @entity0 made the controversial comments in a blog post titled ' she was gagging for it ' on his website ' i find it hard to believe this is not some kind of sick joke or a parody , ' @entity88 , the @entity81 's director told the @entity95			1
' he is suggesting the opposite of the @entity98 guy is a barrister and there ’s no way he does n’t know all this			0
' defending his comments , mr @entity0 said the decision on whether or not a woman is fit enough to have sex should not be left up to ' the red - blooded bloke '			2
‘ after sexual intercourse has taken place whilst a girl was clearly drunk , when she sobers up and then says “ i would n't have consented had i been sober ” i 'm saying very firmly : “ bad luck ” , ' the barrister told @entity113 this morning			0
‘ why should the responsibility for making these decisions be placed upon the bloke ? ' the red - blooded bloke out on the town , there to enjoy himself , if he thinks that someone is likely to consent and he makes the usual enquiries as you do , obviously he should whether she is underage but beyond that i do n't really see why the responsibility for determining whether sexual intercourse takes place with consent and with consent freely given , is entirely the responsibility of the accused person			0
rape victim @entity66 ( left ) described mr @entity0 's comments as ' vile '			1
the barrister penned the controversial blog post following the announcement by @entity133 , @entity134 , ( right ) that the law needed to be adapted to shift blame from rape victims who had been drinking ‘ i think that is wrong i think that is unfair , i think it should be a more balanced approach			2
' the point i 'm trying to make is not that drunken women are not a free - for - all for irresponsible men , what does concern me and that was the reason why all this has started is that the pendulum has swung too far the other way by saying there may be factors which may not be known to the accused at the time but that will subsequently come out which will assist the jury and i say that 's totally unfair			2
’ mr @entity0 was speaking of the recent announcement by the @entity133 , @entity134 , who said more should be done to determine whether a woman was fit to give consent in alleged rape cases			1
‘ it is not a crime to drink , but it is a crime for a rapist to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink , ' mrs @entity134 said last month			0
mr @entity0 however said women who were ' unwilling to behave properly ' ' in towns and cities across the country , girls who should n't be out on the street at all , are inappropriately dressed and getting completely rat - arsed			1
‘ i 'm talking about vulnerable girls , clearly are not either willing or able to behave themselves properly and when i say this i mean dress appropriately and do n't drink to excess			0
‘ these problems then arise where she finds herself finding sexual intercourse with a bloke and then she finds herself saying she did n't consent			0

the barrister added rape statistics would drop if women ' covered up '
