it seems he did n't take too kindly to being interrupted and after a few inquisitive stares he looks like he is taking a few steps back before he lurches forward twice and takes out the drone with his horns			2
the footage then cuts to the owner of the drone walking towards the ram saying ' @entity14 the ram , what are you doing boy , where is it ?
