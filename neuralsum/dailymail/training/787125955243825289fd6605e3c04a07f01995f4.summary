in contrast to the constant barrage of women 's fashion magazines declaring what is attractive , photographer @entity0 set off on a journey around the world			1
the @entity8 traveled to 37 different countries , where she often met women simply walking the street and took their portraits , highlighting what is considered desirable in different cultures			1
from the freezing , chaffing @entity15 near the @entity16 to the sultry tropics of @entity18 , @entity0 , 29 , entitled her startling and revealing project , ' the @entity21			1
' at times spending only 30 seconds with each subject and traveling only with her camera and a backpack , @entity0 tried to take pictures of young women all in their twenties			2
she explained in a statement to @entity30 ' i 'm a [ 29 - year - old ] female photographer from @entity8 that quit her boring job and started a new life			1
two years ago i took my backpack , my camera and begun to travel around the globe , with savings made in years of working			0
' in this journey i photographed hundreds of natural women surrounded by their culture			2
my project is called ' @entity44 ' and is about our planet 's diversity shown through portraits of women			2
one of her subjects is seen here in @entity73 facing the camera : @entity0 captured women in @entity76 , @entity77 ( left ) and the @entity15 in @entity78 ( right ) models : @entity0 has said ' i prefer to photograph natural faces , without a lot of make - up , and to capture that moment of sincerity and serenity that is so specific for women			1
' a woman is seen on the left in @entity56 , and the woman on the right is at the @entity15 @entity0 said she visited a variety of locations , including favelas in @entity95 and ' rough neighborhoods of @entity56 , ' as well as an @entity98 mosque and the @entity100 rainforest			1
she said in her statement ' now i can say that beauty is everywhere , and it ’s not a matter of cosmetics , money , race or social status , but more about being yourself			0
' global directions make us look and behave the same , but we are all beautiful because we are different			0
in the end , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and the beholder is always somebody else			0
' @entity0 added ' when i photograph a woman i talk a lot , i try to to make her feel special , proud and unique			2
i can get along in 5 languages and this helps me a lot , but in some countries , talking becomes body language			0
' i prefer to photograph natural faces , without a lot of make - up , and to capture that moment of sincerity and serenity that is so specific for women			0

other times , i maybe spend one hour , photographing , after i found her on a social network , a day before			0
' @entity0 also addressed criticism that her subjects are solely young women			2
' through [ " the @entity21 , " ] i wish to compare the faces of the world and to show that all the women from my photos have something beautiful , ' she said in the statement			1
' but the comparison has to be made using similar conditions and so i choose only one age group , the one that i 'm part of			0
i think beauty is not about age			0
[ it 's ] more about being natural and sincere			0
' @entity0 also revealed that ' my goal is to continue and take photos of women from each country of the globe , making " the @entity44 " a mirror of our diverse societies and an inspiration for people that try to remain authentic			2
