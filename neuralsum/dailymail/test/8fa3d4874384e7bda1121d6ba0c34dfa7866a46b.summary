for one determined @entity2 teen , accomplishing a goal on a list of things to do before turning 21 was caught in a touching moment			1
as @entity8 , 19 , who has down syndrome waited to find out whether he got a spot on the special education internship with @entity12 , the anticipation was overwhelming for the family			1
in the video filmed by his mother , he thoroughly looks over the letter on april 10 as she anxiously interrupts him wanting to know the decision - which he does not reveal until the end shouting ' i get it			1
i get the job ! ' with hugs , laughs and excitement all around , the priceless reaction left him and his family with big smiles			0
once he finishes reading it , he freezes with shock as he takes in the news ( right ) during the three - minute video posted onto @entity37 by @entity8 's father , @entity38 , the family is in their kitchen while his mother @entity51 is filming the moment			1
as @entity8 begins to read the letter , he is heard saying ' congratulations ' to which is mom says ' @entity8 what does that mean ? ' he quiets her by putting up his hand and continues to read the letter but hilariously she can not contain her excitement and keeps stopping him as he reads			1
@entity8 shouts ' i get it , i get the job ! ' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug @entity8 's mom , @entity71 ( pictured above with her husband @entity72 ) said they always encouraged their son to do everything he could do once he finishes reading the letter in its entirety , he puts it down and freezes with shock as he takes in the news			1
he then looks at his parents and shouts ' i got a job ' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug			2
his mom is heard cheering loudly as they all celebrate over his acceptance letter for the internship			0
@entity8 puts up both of his fists as he finally has accomplished one of the things on his list before turning 21 - which also includes building his muscles and finding a girlfriend			2
but for the 19 - year - old , this achievement comes behind a line of others			0
