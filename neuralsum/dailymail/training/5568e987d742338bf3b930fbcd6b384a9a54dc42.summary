@entity0 has confirmed @entity1 was right to take the penalty that secured @entity3 a crucial @entity5 win as he clarified the moment of controversy			1
the @entity9 striker was accused of being a little bit disrespectful by @entity10 after he took the ball off @entity12 in the dying moments of their last 32 clash with @entity16			1
but @entity0 , who feels ' a drama ' has been made out of the incident , explained the system that is in place for what happens if @entity3 get a penalty			1
once @entity1 came on , however , he was entitled to take charge of the situation as @entity0 says he is @entity10 's deputy			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity10 and @entity1 are the top two penalty takers , but obviously neither of them were on the pitch at the start so you have to nominate someone			1
@entity12 was nominated , but when we had a penalty @entity1 had come onto the field			1
' so @entity12 , being someone with responsibility and trust , gave the penalty to @entity1 so there was no issue			1
there was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure @entity1 was happy to take it , but that was it really			2
@entity1 celebrates his late penalty at @entity29 which gave @entity3 a crucial 1 - 0 win over @entity16 @entity1 and @entity33 clash at @entity29 over who should take the late penalty in the @entity5 clash ' i always assign responsibility every single game and i think in my time here that was been the first time this has ever reared its head			1
we have a whole raft of penalty takers here who are outstanding			0
@entity82 has hardly missed a penalty in his career , so there is another taker if he is on the pitch			0
' if you are the vice captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on , then it is the etiquette to give him the armband			0
it is a similar thing with the penalty			0
' if @entity10 is on the field there is no drama			2
he is the first choice penalty taker			0
after that if @entity1 is on the field he takes the penalty			2
his history shows he scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker			0
@entity1 ( left ) takes the ball from the stand - in skipper despite his initial protests @entity33 ( left ) looked furious with his fellow striker @entity1 for questioning @entity12 's authority while @entity16 ' players argued with the referee over the penalty , @entity3 argued among themselves @entity10 , working as a pundit for @entity115 , accused @entity1 of being a little bit disrespectful ' but at the start none of them were on , so @entity12 was the nominated penalty taker			1
@entity12 was happy enough to take it , but he gave it to @entity1			2
it is his goal there is no drama			0
' @entity0 , whose side travel to @entity126 on sunday , was quick to praise @entity12 for his maturity in the situation but he made a point of stressing that no decision has been made about whether the @entity132 international will take over the club captaincy when @entity10 eventually moves to @entity134			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity12 showed what a team player he is			2
@entity1 is an outstanding penalty taker and we won the game			2
@entity12 showed what a leader he is			0
' people see him as that automatic next captain but that is not necessarily the case			0
people are trying to catapult him into the next @entity10 but he is a totally different player			0
he is working his role very well			0
it is a very , very important role			0
' the @entity150 striker eventually stepped up to fire in the winning penalty for @entity3 on thursday night all was well in the end though when @entity1 fired the penalty into @entity155 's bottom corner for a 1 - 0 win @entity1 's actions angered some of his team - mates , and the striker 's long - term future could be in doubt			1

@entity0 ' side beat @entity16 1 - 0 at @entity29 in the @entity5
@entity1 *insisted* on taking their crucial penalty late on at @entity29
@entity10 accused @entity1 of ' disrespect ' to @entity12
stand - in skipper saw his authority questioned by @entity1 's *behaviour*
but @entity10 *previously* made it clear @entity150 was second pick for penalties
@entity178 : @entity1 does **n't** have a long - term future at @entity3 , his team - mates do **n't** like him and he lacks respect
