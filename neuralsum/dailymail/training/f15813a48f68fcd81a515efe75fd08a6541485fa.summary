by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 24 january 2013 as baby photos go , this collection has got to be one of the most adorable			1
and certainly the most magical			2
a mother who admits being completely obsessed with fairy tales commissioned a professional photographer to take a series of beautiful images of her baby daughter , and in all of them her little girl adopts the starring role in all her favourite stories , including @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
the pictures of baby girl @entity19 , daughter of @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 , were taken by @entity24 photographer @entity23 in @entity25			1

@entity23 , 30 , said : ' @entity44 , loves fairy tales , and her entire family are fans of the tv show @entity51			1
it was from this love that the concept of baby fairy tales came about			2
' @entity44 planned and shopped for the perfect outfits and pieces			0
we talked multiple times a week , throwing around ideas , picking out props and brainstorming on ways to make each and every set perfect			0
' @entity23 explained that she had to figure out the best way to shoot the session and keep a nine - month - old subject happy , ' knowing that most babies do n't have the tolerance or attention span for a long shoot '			1
she said : ' with six sets to plan , i knew we would have to work quickly , and that setting up and tearing down sets would be the most time consuming part of the shoot			0
' we worked quickly , knowing we only need a few really good images of each set , once i felt confident that i had the perfect shot , we moved onto the next set			0
' we only spent about 10 minutes for each set , and then let @entity19 crawl and play in between to keep her happy			2
' can you see my shadow ? @entity19 pretends to be @entity83 as she looks for @entity84 with dog @entity85 in the children 's bedroom at the @entity83 house @entity23 continued : ' her favourite sets were @entity17 and @entity14 , she loved the apples and cookie			1
she started to get fussy when we got to @entity43 , our last indoor set , until she saw the soap bubbles			0
those immediately cheered her up			0
' @entity19 was the perfect baby for the session , and her mom , @entity44 , had the perfect vision			1
together , we were able to create something truly unique that both mother and daughter will treasure			2
' when we blogged the images , we never expected them to be as popular as they are			0
i blog so that my clients can share their sessions with their families , and for potential clients to get an idea of my current work and my style			0
' to have the images go viral like they have has been incredible			0
we have received so many compliments and emails			0
' @entity15 meets a big white ' wolf ' in the woods ( but even he could n't eat something as cute as @entity19 ) , left , and @entity84 floats overhead as @entity19 pouts into the camera as @entity83 , accompanied by @entity85 the dog , right @entity19 takes a seat and prepares to settle down with a good book of her favourite fairy tales @entity14 ( or is that @entity19 ? ) just could n't resist having a nibble of the ' eat me ' biscuits , and will have to wait patiently to see whether they will make her grow or shrink @entity19 dresses up as the dinkiest @entity43 ever ( before she met her @entity130 and swapped her cleaning clothes for a ballgown ) , left , and then gets some inspiration for her next costume change by settling down to read her big book of fairy tales , right @entity19 wonders whether or not to drop her little mousey friend in the bucket of soapy water , left , and plays the prettiest @entity17 there ever was , right @entity19 tucks into biscuits and blue ' drink me ' juice while dressed up as @entity14 , left , and right , @entity145 , the photographer took the photos of baby @entity19 after being commissioned by her mother @entity44 , a self - confessed fairy tale fanatic after an exhausting dressing - up extravaganza , baby @entity19 takes a well - deserved nap , and dreams of all the magical adventures she 's been having			1
