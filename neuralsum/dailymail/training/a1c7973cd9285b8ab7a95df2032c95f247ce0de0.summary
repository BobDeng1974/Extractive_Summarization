the @entity1 military has successfully tested a .50 - caliber sniper round that can change direction on its way to its target			1
and now the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) has released a video of this @entity9 ( @entity10 ) program in action			1
the footage shows the bullet changing direction in mid-air in response to a target 's movements			1
small fins are used to change the bullet 's trajectory , and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second			2
this grab shows the path , original aim point , and the moving target ( green ) according to @entity6 : ' for military snipers , acquiring moving targets in unfavourable conditions , such as high winds and dusty terrain commonly found in @entity40 , is extremely challenging with current technology			1
' it is critical that snipers be able to engage targets faster , and with better accuracy , since any shot that does n’t hit a target also risks the safety of troops by indicating their presence and potentially exposing their location			2
' a video from the @entity9 ( @entity10 ) program shows a bullet changing its direction			2
@entity6 has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air , but this is one way in which the technology could work			1
each self - guided bullet is four inches ( 10 cm ) long			2
a sniper working at extreme range shines a laser onto the target			1
an optical sensor on the bullet detects the light from the laser to identify where the target is			2
once fired , actuators inside the bullet receive data from the optical sensor to guide it to the correct location			0
small fins are used to change the bullet 's trajectory , and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second			2
these changes are in response to movements of the laser , which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target			2
the sniper additionally has to take into account wind , distance and even the curvature of the @entity93 , before pulling the trigger			0
@entity6 claims the new system is the first ever guided small caliber bullet			1
' the exacto .50 - caliber round and optical sighting technology expects to greatly extend the day and night time range over current state - of - the - art sniper systems , ' continued the agency			1
' the system combines a manoeuverable bullet and a real - time guidance system to track and deliver the projectile to the target , allowing the bullet to change path during flight to compensate for any unexpected factors that may drive it off course			1
' technology development in @entity112 included the design , integration and demonstration of aero - actuation controls , power sources , optical guidance systems , and sensors			0
' the program ’s next phase includes a system - level live - fire test and technology refinement to enhance and improve performance			2
' the current world record for the longest certified kill was by corporal @entity127 of the @entity129 @entity128 , who killed two @entity130 in november 2009 from 1.54 miles ( 22.4km )			1
the shot was approximately 3,000ft ( 914 metres ) beyond the stated maximum range of the @entity134 sniper rifle , used by corporal @entity127			2
the @entity130 were so far away it took each round almost three seconds to reach its target			1
snipers typically work in two - man teams with a spotter assisting the gunman identifying targets as well as providing security			0
but environmental details such as wind , rain and even humidity can affect the flight path of a bullet			0
this graphic reveals how the @entity10 bullet tracks its target and changes directions			0
the sniper additionally has to take into account wind , distance and even the curvature of the @entity93 , before pulling the trigger			0
@entity6 has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air , but this is one way in which the technology could work			1
a sniper begins by shining a laser onto the target			0
an optical sensor on the 4 - inch ( 10cm ) exacto bullet ( illustrated ) detects the laser to identify where the target is			1
as the bullet moves through the air , it responds to changes in the movement of the laser , which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target also bullets have to counter gravity and droop down over longer distances			1
under the new system , a sniper will be able to adjust the bullet 's direction mid-flight in case a target moved or the bullet shifted due to a gust of wind			1
the newly released video shows two tests filmed earlier this year			0
in the both tests the round is fired deliberately off target but turns in mid-air			1
in the second target , the round it its intended target despite being fired several feet to the left			0
@entity202 , professor emeritus at the @entity203 said the system is a very interesting development			0
he told @entity206 : ' i do n’t know if you push a button and it takes over			0
i just could n’t find out enough about the system to know how it works			0
' you still need to train these snipers in the traditional methods			0
right now , sniping is a real precise art. ' this screengrab shows the bullet ( shown in white ) changing from its original path , pictured in red , and moving to face the target , shown in green			0

' @entity239 image used many snipers use .50 caliber bullets , similar to the ones pictured , because their weight causes significant damage			1

the @entity257 is developing a bullet which can change direction mid-air
the .50 - caliber sniper round was successfully tested earlier this *summer*
the @entity6 released the test footage
the world record for a *confirmed* sniper kill is longer than 1.5 miles ( 2.4km )
@entity6 hopes the new bullets will allow snipers to take even longer shots
a bullet at that range can take almost three seconds to reach its target
