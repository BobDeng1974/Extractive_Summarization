by @entity0 @entity2 heiress @entity1 has lost a court battle against her ex-boyfriend after a judge ruled that she was wrong to try and reclaim a @entity7 supercar she gave him as a present			1
the wealthy socialite must now pay more than £ 20,000 in compensation to two car companies who were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case was ongoing			0
mr @entity16 said in a @entity18 judgement yesterday that the wrangling over the £ 380,000 @entity20 had ' caused everyone far more trouble than it is worth '			2
ms @entity1 said she was ' disappointed ' by the ruling - but today she was pictured in a @entity7 showroom in @entity25 , @entity26 , apparently shopping for a replacement			1
shopping : @entity1 at a @entity7 showroom in @entity25 , @entity26 today checking out the wares : ms @entity1 looks at the interior of a lime - green vehicle with a salesman the 29 - year - old gave the original car to her then - lover @entity35 on his 38th birthday in april 2012 , but when they broke up three months later she claimed it belonged to her			1
mr @entity35 , a former stockbroker , used the @entity7 to secure a loan from @entity40 in connection with a white @entity42 which he bought ms @entity1 for @entity44 in 2011			1
in april 2013 , bailiffs acting on behalf of @entity40 seized the car from a garage where ms @entity1 was having it serviced			2
the firm sold the vehicle to @entity49 , which apparently arranged to sell it on to a buyer in @entity52 until the heiress obtained a @entity18 injunction stopping the sale on the grounds that she had never actually given the @entity7 to mr @entity35			1
chat : the socialite talking to a salesman - a day after a judge ruled that she had to give a @entity7 back to her ex-boyfriend walking out : it was unclear whether or not ms @entity1 made a purchase during her trip to the showroom in a written judgement delivered in @entity67 yesterday , mr @entity16 said that ms @entity1 was wrong to interfere and did not own the car			1
he ruled that she should pay @entity40 £ 7,500 in damages , while @entity70 was awarded £ 15,000 as well as the @entity7 and an amount of interest which has yet to be determined			0
' ms @entity1 's conduct was wrongful and interfered with the title and possession by @entity40 and @entity70 by interfering with sales made by @entity40 and @entity70 , and by removing the car , and by preventing dealings with the proceeds of the sale of the car , ' the judge said			2
' the injunctions obtained by ms @entity1 were wrongfully granted , because they were obtained on the basis of false evidence to the effect the car had not been a gift to mr @entity35			0
' court battle : @entity1 , right , has lost a case against her ex-boyfriend @entity35 , left claim : the heiress tried to argue that she owned this @entity20 which she gave her then - lover for his 38th birthday shortly before they broke up in 2012 2010 : @entity1 begins dating @entity35 december 2011 : he buys her a white @entity42 as a @entity44 present april 2012 : on mr @entity35 's 38th birthday , ms @entity1 gives him a black @entity20 worth £ 380,000 july 2012 : the couple split up , and ms @entity1 keeps the supercar april 2013 : bailiffs seize the car while the heiress is having it serviced , saying that mr @entity35 used it to repay the debt he incurred buying the @entity42 april 2013 : ms @entity1 wins a @entity18 injunction stopping the car from being sold abroad november 2013 : she admits that mr @entity35 is the legal owner of the car january 2014 : a judge rules that she must compensate two car companies for obstructing the sale of the @entity7 the car is currently being stored by the heiress ' father @entity108 , who faces his own court case after being indicted on charges of bribery in @entity113			1
@entity115 argued ms @entity1 's allegation that the company was prepared to sell a car it did not own had damaged its reputation , and cost it £ 440,000 in lost profits , but the judge rejected that claim			2
after the verdict , a spokesman for ms @entity1 said : ' @entity1 is disappointed by this verdict and she absolutely maintains that the vehicle was never intended to be a gift			0
' we are , however , relieved the spurious counter claim brought against @entity1 by @entity40 was dismissed by the judge			0
' the judge was correct when he said the car had been more trouble than its worth and this has been a difficult time for @entity1 and her family			0
@entity1 thanks everyone for their support and it is now time to focus on the future and positive times ahead			0
' ms @entity1 and mr @entity35 dated for two and a half years , but they split after claims emerged that mr @entity35 had been filmed having sex with other women			0
defeat : ms @entity1 was told by a high court judge that she is not the rightful owner of the car , pictured debt : mr @entity35 used the @entity7 to repay the purchase of this @entity42 , a gift for ms @entity1 new partner : ms @entity1 pictured earlier this month with her husband @entity152 yesterday 's ruling was the second legal setback the socialite had received in just a few days , after prosecutors decided to drop charges against a man accused of mugging her husband @entity152			1
the 32 - year - old was seen on cctv grappling with an attacker , but he was later unable to identify the culprit and the @entity164 has now concluded that there is insufficient evidence linking him with the alleged crime to continue proceedings			0
