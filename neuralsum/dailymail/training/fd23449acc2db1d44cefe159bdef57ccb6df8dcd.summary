@entity0 is too good a player not to return to form at some point			1
what he must ask himself is whether he can do that while he is captain			0
@entity0 ’s brain seems scrambled and he is having to work so hard on his leadership that i wonder whether he has the mental energy to work on his batting as well			1
i am sure there is a hundred just around the corner but it will take a lot of grit , determination and a little bit of luck for @entity0 to get there			1
@entity18 took his nick on day two but did n’t go for one offered by @entity20			0
crossroad : @entity22 captain @entity0 has some decisions to make after another failure at @entity25 out of nick : @entity0 looks back as his edge lands in the gloves of @entity18 on day two of the second test under pressure : @entity0 's dismissal for 10 continues his horror run of form even if @entity0 gets runs in the second innings here he will have to decide whether he has enough in the tank to sort everything out for the third test			1
@entity0 ’s captaincy has n’t been good since the first innings at @entity41			1
he has been reactive and has to take the blame for how @entity22 bowled here			2
@entity22 have had the better of conditions here and may yet go on to win the game but @entity46 have shown how best to exploit the conditions			2
you could argue , of course , that it is the bowlers ’ fault that opportunities were wasted on thursday but the tactics are set by the captain			0
@entity55 and @entity56 know what they want and like to set their own fields but the captain has to get his way because the wins and losses go against his name			0
@entity56 and @entity55 are wonderful assets and @entity0 has to captain them well and make sure they think they ’re getting what they want			2
even if it ’s the captain who is doing it his way			0
@entity0 has been in the job for a couple of years but he still has a lot to learn			2
one area of concern is that too many decisions are being made off the field , such as when @entity22 bowled the right lengths only after lunch on the first day			1
and @entity0 seems too slow to think on his feet and change plans			2
assets : @entity0 needs to make @entity55 and @entity56 think they 're getting what they want in the pavilion : @entity0 appears to make too many decisions off the field he has to sit down at the end of this test and ask himself whether putting so much energy into trying to be a better captain is harming his game			1
what i want to see is @entity0 getting hundreds for @entity22 again			1
just say he did n’t play in the third test			0
what would we miss most ? we ’d miss the runs he scores when he is in form more than his captaincy			1
the bottom line for me is whether @entity0 feels that giving up the captaincy would give himself the best chance of scoring runs again			1
he is not a natural leader and has to work so hard at it			0
but what @entity22 need is for him to be their rock again			0
there is always someone else who could be captain ; someone who could surprise us with his leadership			0
but i want @entity0 back scoring hundreds , whatever it takes .			0

a hundred is around the corner for @entity0 , but it will take grit
the @entity22 skipper went *cheaply* again , caught behind for 10 at @entity25
@entity0 ’s captaincy has n’t been good since the first innings at @entity41
@entity22 would miss @entity0 's runs more than his leadership on the field
