@entity0 is going to cause @entity2 a huge problem in the future and the cost to fix it will be enormous			1
there will come a point one day when @entity7 is no longer able to rely on his captain and , privately , he will be dreading when that time comes			1
the term to describe @entity0 ’s influence on this @entity2 team is the same as the one you would label his performance at @entity16 : colossal			1
@entity7 ’s brilliance as a manager can not be overstated			1
wherever he goes , he is successful and he has won trophies with any number of different players			0
some managers need big individuals to get them over the line but @entity7 does it regardless of who he is working with			1
@entity0 's current form for @entity2 is arguably as impressive as it was 10 years ago @entity0 scored the opening goal of the game in the recent @entity32 win against @entity33 @entity34 : 2004 - 05 , 2005 - 06 , 2009 - 10			1
@entity35 : 1999 - 00 , 2006 - 07 , 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2011 - 12			0
@entity36 : 2004 - 05 , 2006 - 07 , 2014 - 15			0
@entity37 : 2005 , 2009			0
@entity38 : 2011 - 12			0
@entity39 : 2012 - 13			0
with @entity0 , however , the case is different			2
when @entity2 won the @entity36 10 years ago — the first of the five trophies they lifted during @entity7 ’s first reign — the side was built around a formidable spine of @entity47 , @entity0 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
all those players have been subsequently replaced with one notable exception			2
@entity0 was as good against @entity33 as he was against @entity55 at the @entity56 in 2005 and you have to ask when the time comes to fill his shoes , what will the price be ? when you think @entity60 paid £ 32million for @entity61 last summer and @entity62 cost @entity63 £ 50m , you get an idea of how difficult it will be to find someone with @entity0 ’s many qualities			1
on these pages 14 months ago , i described @entity0 as the best defender in @entity34 history and one moment towards the end of the game on sunday showed why he has stayed at the top of his profession for so long			1
@entity0 is the only player that remains from the old spine of the @entity2 team , the others have been replaced @entity7 recognises the importance of his captain ad will be keen to retain his services the game was won but @entity33 were looking to grab a consolation and it looked like it might arrive when @entity87 wriggled into the area			1
he was denied , though , by @entity0 putting his body on the line to make sure @entity2 ’s goal was n’t threatened			1
during the @entity92 last summer , i complained that there was a lack of great central defenders playing now — the type who will do the dirty work and would kill for a clean sheet			0
@entity0 is one of the remaining few			2
as a player , i hold him in the highest regard and his consistency has been remarkable			0
sometimes i do n’t think it gets appreciated how difficult it is to stay at one club for your entire career , especially in the position @entity110 has filled			1
i know what it is like to get beyond 30 and have people writing you off on the basis of your age , the constant questioning of ‘ is he the same as he used to be ? ’			2
a bad game and the scrutiny comes on you			0
there is an added pressure for defenders			0
when you are not at your best , you know that one mistake and you will be the one who costs the team the game ; midfielders or strikers can be taken off but as a defender there is nowhere to hide			0
@entity63 paid £ 50million for @entity62 , who was considered surplus to requirements at @entity2 @entity60 paid £ 32m for @entity61 but did n't feel comfortable starting him against @entity135 but @entity110 has never hidden , not even after the campaign two years ago when he made just 14 appearances			1
this season he is up to 36 and playing as well as he has ever done , leaving some to ask whether he could play for @entity138 again			0
wisely , he has ended such talk			0
he might be the best @entity140 defender but he is not needed for the @entity142 qualification campaign , as @entity138 have already qualified			0
the extra recovery time he now has between games helps his form and who is to say he will be playing so well in 18 months anyway ? the future for @entity138 is players such as @entity149 and @entity150			0
concentrating on @entity2 is best for him			2
he is yet to sign a deal but i do n’t for one moment expect the @entity155 hierarchy to let him slip out of the club			0
he is too valuable and given how @entity7 sets his team up , he could play for at least another two years			2
@entity158 and @entity159 are good players but without @entity0 , i would not be confident about @entity2 winning the @entity34 next season			1
if he was to leave , there would not be a team in the top flight who @entity0 would not improve			1
@entity7 knows this better than anyone			2
@entity158 and @entity159 are good defenders but perhaps not in the same class as @entity0 @entity0 and fellow goalscorer @entity169 celebrate during the @entity32 final win at @entity16			2

@entity2 will find it *extremely* difficult to replace their captain @entity0
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity47 , @entity48 all replaced
but @entity2 have never found a replacement for @entity0
people *underestimate* how hard it is to stay at a top club for so long
@entity7 knows the value of @entity0 and wo n't let him leave
