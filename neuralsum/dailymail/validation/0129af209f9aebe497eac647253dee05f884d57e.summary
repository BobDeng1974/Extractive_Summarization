@entity0 has backed the @entity1 in @entity2 to host july 's @entity4 quarter - final between @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity5 sealed a second successive last - eight tie with a 3 - 2 victory against the @entity9 in @entity10 last weekend			1
and the @entity11 is now looking to book a grass - court venue for the tie which takes place on july 17 - 19 , the weekend following the conclusion of @entity16			2
@entity0 , pictured winning his second round match in @entity18 , wants to play @entity4 at @entity19 's @entity0 cheers from the sidelines as @entity23 defeat @entity9 to reach the @entity4 quarter finals @entity5 vs @entity6 @entity25 vs @entity26 @entity27 vs @entity28 @entity29 vs @entity30 @entity31 understands an approach was made to @entity19 's earlier this week to gauge the club 's interest in holding the tie			1
@entity19 's hosts the @entity37 from june 15 - 21 where @entity0 has been a three time winner , picking up titles at the @entity41 event in 2009 , 2011 and 2013			1
for @entity19 's to stage the @entity4 this year , the temporary stands would have to remain in place for another four weeks and it remains to be seen whether the club would be willing to put up with the extra disruption as a result			2
@entity0 made it blatantly clear on saturday , though , that @entity19 's is his preferred venue during a post-match interview after his second - round win against @entity51 in @entity18			1
@entity0 ' really likes the conditions ' at @entity1 where he has won the title three times the @entity56 no 1 won the @entity41 tournament at @entity19 's in 2013 ( left ) , 2011 ( centre ) and 2009 ( right ) @entity0 told @entity59 : ' i hope we can do it at @entity1			1
they 'll get a crowd there			0
i really like the conditions there			0
' @entity67 has played well there in the past			0
my brother [ @entity70 ] made the final there last year so the players in our team have done well there			0
' it just depends on if they can get the court ready on time and if they would like to host it			0
' i think we need to play in an arena that is big enough for the tie and i think they can get 7,500 - 8,000 people there			2
i think that would be a good place to play			0
