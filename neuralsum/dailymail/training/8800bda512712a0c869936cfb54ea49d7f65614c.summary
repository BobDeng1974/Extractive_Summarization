by @entity0 @entity2 scientists secretly poisoned guinea pigs with the same deadly nerve agent sarin used by @entity5 in @entity6			1
over the past two years 223 guinea pigs were given the banned gas , revered as one of the most murderous weapons in modern warfare , by scientists at the military science base @entity14 in @entity15			1
the @entity2 says the ' vital ' tests on the animals , who were not anaesthetised , were carried out in the battle to find an antidote for sarin , used by @entity6 president @entity5 in an attack against his own people last august			1
tests : over the past two years 223 guinea pigs were given the banned gas by scientists at the military science base @entity14 in @entity15 ( pictured ) @entity5 denied his soldiers were responsible for the attack on the outskirts of @entity30 , which killed more than 1,400 people , many of them children , and prompted the threat of military action by the @entity34 unless @entity6 's chemical weapons were destroyed			1
but news that the tests were being carried out on animals at @entity14 has angered animal rights charity @entity40			1
' after all the prime minister 's tough talk about @entity6 , it 's deplorable that the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) has been secretly using the same chemical nerve agents that @entity5 has used in order to poison hundreds of animals within our own borders , ' a spokesman told @entity51			1
' not only are these tests cruel , they 're also utterly useless , since even though humans and other species experience pain and fear in the same way , every species differs in its physiological responses to chemical agents and antidotes			1
' the fact that the @entity2 , with the best technology in the world at its disposal , still chooses to torture animals in costly and agonising experiments , which can not be extrapolated to humans , is a bloody stain on the whole country			1
antidote : the @entity2 says the ' vital ' tests on the animals were carried out in the battle to find an antidote for sarin , used by @entity6 president @entity5 in an attack against his own people last august ' these experiments , using a banned nerve gas , no less , prove that the government 's claims about trying to find alternatives to live testing are entirely meaningless			1
' the @entity2 says that after the tests the animals were humanely put down using an overdose of anaesthetic			1
' this is vital research used to develop antidotes which save the lives of both troops and civilians , a spokesman told @entity51			2
' advances in technology mean that we are reducing the number of procedures carried out , but some research simply can not be conducted without the use of animals			2
@entity101 was first developed as pesticide by the @entity103 in 1938			0
it has since been identified as one of the most potent and rapidly acting of the so - called nerve agents			0
even at very low concentrations @entity101 can kill in less than ten minutes as direct inhalation leads to suffocation from lung muscle paralysis , unless an antidote can be administered			0
sarin in its vapor form causes symptoms within seconds and in its liquid form symptoms appear within minutes			0
@entity101 stops the off - switch enzyme of the body 's glands and muscles , causing them to work continuously , symptoms include : runny nose , watery eyes , pinpoint pupils , eye pain , blurred vision , drooling and excessive sweating , cough , chest tightness , rapid breathing , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , and / or abdominal pain , increased urination , confusion , drowsiness , weakness , headache , slow or fast heart rate , low or high blood pressure			0
even a small amount of sarin can cause serious injury and many victims will not know they 've been exposed to the oderless , colorless , tasteless compound			0
@entity101 has been classified as a weapon of mass destruction and production and stockpiling of the chemical is banned under the @entity152 of 1993			1
' all such work complies with the @entity152 which allows research on chemical weapons for the development of antidotes			2
' the spokesman added that examples of @entity2 research include improved treatments of trauma which have saved lives in @entity164 , a treatment for botulism which has saved civilian lives , and safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents			2
just a few drops of sarin , which has no taste , no smell and no colour , can be enough to kill a person in under 10 minutes			0
it is usually emitted from a canister or missile , releasing a cloud of droplets fine enough to be inhaled , and can also enter the body through the eyes and skin			0
victims suffer muscle paralysis and even those who survive can be left with permanent neurological damage			0
the row of guinea pigs is the latest in a line animal cruelty scandals to hit the @entity2 last month it was revealed in a @entity193 request that almost 200 horses were put down by @entity2 vets in the last decade , including 20 that were physically healthy but were said to have ' dangerous temperaments			1
' and in march it emerged that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in @entity200 over a three - year period for research into battlefield injuries			2
some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at @entity14			0
animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘ impossible to justify medically , ethically or educationally ’ , but the @entity2 insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare			2
it has also been revealed that more than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009			0
the @entity2 put down 42 @entity200 dogs due to a ' dangerous temperament ' , while 27 developed cancer - related health problems			2
the majority , 117 were put down due to ' age and welfare ' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis			0
four were killed in action in @entity164 , and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident .			0
