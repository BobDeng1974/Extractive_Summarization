by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 28 october 2013 the luxury residence that helped @entity3 bishop @entity2 earn the nickname ‘ @entity5 ’ may be turned into a soup kitchen or refugee centre			1
the complex in @entity9 was renovated at a cost of 31 million - euros ( £ 26.4 million ) , a figure that has sparked outrage in @entity3			1
however , it may now be used for the benefit of the needy , according to a newspaper report			2
good cause : the residence of @entity2 in @entity9 may be turned into a soup kitchen or refugee centre an aerial view of the @entity2 residence ( foreground )			1
top left is the @entity25 bishop @entity2 ( left ) has been expelled by @entity26 following the spending of some 31 million euros on a residence the @entity29 claims that @entity31 officials want the sprawling property to be used to feed and house the poor			1
campaign group @entity34 told paper : ‘ the residence is like an inherited sin which the bishop has left in his wake			1
people who seek sanctuary with us could be given food in the residence			2
’ the outlay on the complex resulted in @entity2 , 53 , being formally suspended			1
the @entity47 did n't say how long he would spend away from the diocese of @entity9 but it refused calls to remove him permanently			0
it gave no information on where he would go or what he would do			0
people walk past a part of the residence , the renovations to which have been defended by @entity2 @entity2 has defended the expenditures on his residence , saying the bill was actually for 10 projects and there were additional costs because the buildings were under historical protection			1
but in a country where @entity71 launched the reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the church , the outcry has been enormous			0
the perceived lack of financial transparency has also struck a chord since a church tax in @entity3 brings in billions a year to the @entity3 church			0
in a highly unusual move , bishop @entity2 of @entity9 was ordered to leave his diocese while an investigation and audit into cost over-runs is held @entity2 's leadership style has also been criticised			1
in august and september , more than 4,000 people signed an open letter to the bishop criticising what they considered his authoritarian style			2
the head of the @entity3 bishops ' conference , archbishop @entity94 , has been particularly blunt in his criticism of the expenditures and the credibility problem it was causing the church			2
he said the ' decisive ' turning point came when @entity104 prosecutors earlier this month asked a court to levy an unspecified fine against the bishop for false testimony in a related case			1
@entity94 has said the church commission will investigate the costs of the renovation , the financing and how decisions about the restoration evolved			0
@entity2 's leadership style has also been criticized canon lawyers will determine if @entity2 violated church law regarding the use of church money , @entity94 said			1
in a statement , @entity94 pledged that the commission would do its work ' quickly and carefully			0
' @entity26 ' decision opens ' a space to return to inner calm and create a new basis for talks , ' he said			0
the @entity47 stressed that @entity26 took the decision based on ' objective ' information , suggesting that the @entity47 was n't being swayed by the popular outcry			0
@entity26 has also made it clear he expects his bishops to live simply , setting as an example his own humble lifestyle			0
the @entity47 said the bishop was leaving pending the outcome of a @entity3 church investigation into the expenditures and his role in the affair			1
fellow bishops and lay @entity143 in the diocese , however , expressed doubt that he would ever be able to return			0
' this is a crisis of confidence that will be hard to overcome , ' said the dean of the cathedral chapter , @entity152			0
@entity9 's vicar general , the rev. @entity153 , who had been due to start january 1 , will instead begin work immediately and will run the diocese during @entity2 's absence , the @entity47 said			1
@entity3 's main lay catholic group , the @entity157 , praised the decision			2
' @entity26 ' decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the @entity9 diocese , because the situation had become an increasing burden for the faithful there and in all of @entity3 , ' said @entity168 , the group 's head			2
the @entity3 government refused to comment on the matter			0
@entity172 , bishop of @entity173 , said the pope had made a ' smart ' decision which gives all concerned time to review the situation calmly			2
but in comments to the @entity3 newspaper @entity179 , he cast doubt on @entity2 ever returning to @entity9			1
' there is a fundamental crisis of confidence in @entity9			0
the situation there is a mess , ' @entity172 was quoted as saying .			0
