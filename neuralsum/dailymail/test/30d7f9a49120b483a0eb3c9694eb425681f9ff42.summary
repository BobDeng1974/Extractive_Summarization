' having fun with friends is at the heart of the @entity9 experience , ' said @entity9 in a blog post			1
' our hunch was that if you could make videos collaboratively , the creative process would be more fun and the final product would be cooler			0
' today , we are introducing @entity0 , a creative tool to make videos with friends			1
' once a friend adds a clip to a video , a user 's friend â€™s friends will also be shown the video in @entity0 and will be able to add to it			1
' the potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially from there , so a short video can become an inventive project between circles of friends that you can share to @entity9 , or anywhere on the internet , at any time , ' continued the blog post			1
if it is a hoax then it is an elaborate one that @entity9 has continued for longer than @entity171 .			2

@entity0 was developed in @entity22 and is available on @entity26 and @entity25
it lets you film a video and uploaded it to the app and @entity9
friends then film their own clips and tag them onto the end of your video
