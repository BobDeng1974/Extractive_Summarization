friday ’s victory for a small stable of 10 horses was a heart - warming end to a festival dominated by the big guns from @entity26 and @entity27			2
2015 @entity6 winner @entity5 could race at @entity29 on november 28 @entity30 kisses the @entity6 following @entity5 's length and a half victory the eight - year - old , who was ridden by conditional jockey @entity30 , will not run again this season and @entity36 , daughter of the late amateur rider , broadcaster and journalist , @entity40 , believes @entity5 ’s similarity to @entity1 means a crack at the @entity29 race on november 28 is feasible challenge			1

his family also have history in the race , with older brother @entity50 winning the 2011 @entity2			2
@entity16 said : ‘ we might consider the @entity52 and the @entity53 , for sure			0
the world is our oyster now but , depending on what the handicapper does , we might try to win the @entity2 off top weight			2
‘ we know he likes @entity29 and he seems to have a lot of similarities with @entity1			0
’ @entity62 ( left ) and trainer @entity15 are all smiles with the 2015 @entity6 trophy the @entity65 - trained @entity1 , the 2008 @entity6 winner , won the @entity2 twice in 2007 and 2009			1
on the latter occasion , he defied a @entity69 handicap mark of 174 when carrying 11st 12lb			0
chief handicapper @entity71 intends rating @entity72 171 , the highest for a novice this century and 1lb higher than given to @entity74 after his spectacular @entity76 ’ @entity45 win			0

the @entity86 - ridden 5 - 2 favourite , @entity87 , fell at the seventh fence			0
@entity62 and @entity5 clear a fence on their way to victory at the @entity6			1
