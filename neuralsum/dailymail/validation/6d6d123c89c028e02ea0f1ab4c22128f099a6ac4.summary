real estate heir @entity0 was charged on monday in @entity2 with first - degree murder @entity0 's mumblings about how he ' killed them all ' provided the dramatic kick to a documentary about the millionaire 's troubled life and connection to three slayings , but it was words he penned that helped lead to his arrest on a murder charge , a law enforcement official said			1
analysis linking a letter @entity0 wrote to his friend @entity21 a year before her death with one he said ' only the killer could have written ' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long - dormant investigation , a police source said			1
@entity0 , 71 , was charged on monday in @entity2 with first - degree murder in the shooting of @entity21 , the daughter of a prominent @entity31 mobster , back in 2000			1
he could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime			1
he waived extradition in @entity38 , but authorities there charged him late on monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there saturday			1
he was also found in possession of a small amount of marijuana			1
prosecutors believed that @entity0 was a flight risk after the revelations of the documentary and may have been planning to head for @entity53			1
he was found with fake ids in his hotel room			0
however one of his lawyers , @entity58 , told @entity59 that his client had left his @entity62 home for @entity38 to escape the media and that he had called daily to check in with him , asking for him by name			1
it was not clear how soon @entity0 would be returned to @entity66			2
attorney @entity67 said outside court that @entity0 did n't kill @entity21 , and is ' ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial '			1
presented with the two letters in the finale of @entity74 : the life and deaths of @entity0 that aired sunday on @entity78 , the eccentric heir blinked , burped oddly , pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer			1
then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom , still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next			0
you 're caught ! ' @entity0 whispered before the sound of running water is heard			2
' what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course			0
' that moment did n't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a @entity103 real estate fortune , it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors			2
the official said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way			0
but legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence			0
@entity0 and documentary producer @entity118 ( right ) examine handwriting examples from two letters			2
analysis linking a letter @entity0 wrote to @entity21 a year before her death with one he said ' only the killer could have written ' to point police to her body was new evidence in the investigation , a police source said @entity0 , far right , was escorted into @entity130 through a tunnel entrance , in @entity38 on monday for a court hearing to extradite him to @entity2 to face a murder charge ' any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him , they can use against him , ' said @entity138 , a law professor at the @entity139			1
' even if it 's sketchy , and only in context appears to make him look guilty			0
' @entity143 @entity142 , a defense attorney in @entity144 , @entity103 , said @entity0 's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments , perhaps dismissing them as a joke			2
' prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self - reflection , and i assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded , and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative , ' @entity142 said			0
' i do n't think it 's quite the smoking gun			0
' @entity0 — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family , whose @entity103 real estate empire is worth about $ 4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states			2
when @entity0 approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera , against the advice of his lawyers , he had already weathered one murder case , winning an acquittal in a gory @entity168 , @entity169 , dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self - defense			1
he was still suspected in the killing of @entity21 , whose father was a @entity31 mobster associated with @entity174 and @entity175 , and the disappearance of his wife , @entity177 , who was declared dead long after she vanished in @entity103 in 1982			1
@entity21 was found shot execution - style outside her home in @entity2 in 2000			1
her friend , @entity0 , was charged with her murder on monday @entity177 's brother , @entity182 , told today on tuesday that he believed @entity0 's confession was genuine and an admission that the 71 - year - old had killed his sister decades before			1
mr @entity182 said : ' the revelation was like something we ‘ ve been waiting for 33 years			0
' he added : ' i believe that @entity191 will somehow have an epiphany of conscience , contrary to the advice of lawyers			0
' i think he ’s about ready to say , '' you know , enough is enough			0
this is what @entity198 would want and this is what i ’m going to do			0
'' ' @entity21 , 55 , was shot once in the back of the head at her home near @entity205 shortly before @entity103 investigators planned to question her about @entity208 's disappearance			2
the documentary showed filmmaker @entity118 confronting @entity0 with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted @entity205 police to look for a ' cadaver ' at @entity21 's address			1
@entity0 offered that whoever sent it was ' taking a big risk			2
you 're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written			0
' then , in the final episode , @entity118 revealed another envelope , which @entity0 acknowledged mailing to @entity21 , that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as ' @entity227			1
' ' i wrote this one but i did not write the cadaver one , ' @entity0 said			2
but when shown an enlargement of both copies , @entity0 could n't distinguish them			0
@entity103 defense lawyer @entity233 said the surprising thing was that police never unearthed the letter to @entity21 that filmmakers got their hands on			0
' even if @entity0 was n't the prime suspect , you would think they would have been looking through all her papers to see if the person who killed her had ever written her a letter , ' @entity233 said			0
' finding the letter was pure good fortune			0
' with the bathroom recording immediately following the confrontation over the two handwriting samples , prosecutors have strong evidence , said @entity233 , who handles white - collar criminal cases			0
' how often do you have a @entity254 moment to end your documentary ? ' he said			0
@entity0 's first wife , @entity256 ( pictured left ) , has been missing since 1982			0
her brother , @entity182 , said on tuesday that following the @entity78 show he hoped @entity0 would have an ' epiphany of conscience ' and tell them what happened to his sister @entity265 's attorneys , including @entity67 , center , and @entity267 , left , speak after leaving court in @entity38 on monday			1
@entity67 said @entity0 did n't kill @entity21 , and is ' ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial '			1

@entity0 , 71 , was charged on monday in @entity2 with first - degree murder in the shooting of @entity21 , daughter of a prominent @entity31 mobster
