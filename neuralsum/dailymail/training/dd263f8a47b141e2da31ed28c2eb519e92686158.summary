although perhaps not for much longer ? a new device that contains the information of all the credit cards you have in your wallet or purse has been developed by a company in @entity9			2
known as @entity12 , the company 's plan is for for people to ditch the plastic , their bulging wallets and purses , and instead just use one single computerized card to handle all of your cash transactions			1
the way of the future : the coin card aims to make paying with multiple credit cards simpler by incorporating everything you own onto one device past / future : coin wants to replace bulging wallets full of credit cards with a single device called a @entity12 ( right ) that can hold the information of all the cards you own the seven - person start - up has introduced an all - in - one credit card on which users will be able to load all of their credit or debit card information			1
the clever part about the coin card is that is uses a magnetic strip like any regular credit or debit card , however the information on the strip can change depending on what card the customer wants to use			1
a small microchip holds the information of up to eight cards securely in the device			2
the buyer is then able to switch between cards at the press of a button			2
however critics have claimed the device is nothing to get too excited about			0
as countries slowly move towards the more secure @entity61 credit card system , the @entity12 device is likely to become obsolete			1
compact : the @entity12 car is sleek and small by a regular credit card but it can hold the information of up to eight others including debit cards , gift cards , loyalty cards and membership cards ' this is designed for the lifestyle of today with the technology of tomorrow , ” says @entity74 , founder of @entity12			1
' you do n’t need eight cards every day , so your phone is kind of like your drawer , and your @entity12 is kind of like your wallet			1
' users then take photos of their cards , swipe them through the dongle and upload them to the @entity12 mobile app , which stores the info onto your coin card			1
when you want to pay , you browse through stored cards on your @entity12 , select one , and swipe it anywhere credit , debit or gift cards are accepted			1
information is loaded onto the card through a mobile app. the process of adding card information to the mobile app is very simple and is done by taking a picture or two and swiping credit cards through a dongle attached to your phone			0
mobile payments remain an elusive area with a number of banks and card suppliers attempting to come up with a convenient , safe and secure solution			0
one card for all : coin is fabricated with a patent - pending magnetic strip that can change depending on what card one wants to use			1
the battery in @entity12 is supposed to last up to two years convenient : the coin card is approximately the size of a single credit card that can store all your swipe - able cards and be used to pay everywhere cards are accepted , all in real time in order to make a payment with this card , users tap a button on the coin card and pick which account they want to pay with , whether it 's a business credit card or a personal debit card			1
after picking an account , the coin card is swiped through , no different than any other card			0
both tech large and small have attempted to crack the mobile payments sector and any firm able to facilitate person - to - person or person - to - business transitions on a mass scale stands to gain significant profit off such payments			0
@entity135 , a blogger with @entity136 , is n't convinced the technology will takeoff			0
' to me , the only real problem with @entity12 is that it feels like a stopgap technology , like those cd - changer cartridges that were popular for a little while before everyone switched to mp3s			2
replacing eight cards with one may lighten your load by an ounce or two , but is that enough to convince people to take the leap of faith involved in adopting a new payment system ? even early adopters could be forgiven for holding out for a more comprehensive digital wallet — the kind that will let you pay for everything just by tapping your phone , or perhaps some other , even more seamless gesture			2
' other critics have said the card is not forward - thinking or future - proof whatsoever			0
one claimed it was nothing more than ' old technology wrapped up in a posh case			0
' ' this is not at all useful overseas where @entity166 , @entity167 and most of @entity168 use @entity61			1
in fact , it 's typical @entity173 thinking whereby the developers have only thought of themselves and not of the winder consequences of usefulness of the @entity177 your $ 100 if i were you ! ' how it works : your credit cards and loaded onto the @entity12 app by swiping them in and taking a photo			1
the coin card can then be used like a normal credit card smart card : the coin card uses a @entity190 emitter which means if the card is left behind for any reason the card will no longer function the battery in @entity12 , said to last up to two years , powers a small display screen that shows which saved card will be charged , along with its expiration date			2
cards are entered into @entity12 after being swiped on a square - like dongle plugged into a smartphone			1
there are also few worries about leaving the card behind somewhere or losing it altogether			0
the coin card only operates if your smartphone is nearby by using the bluetooth signals			0
if the card is disconnected for more than ten minutes , the phone will alert the customer that they have left their card behind			0
if the owner drifts too far from @entity12 , his or her smartphone will alert them			0
if the card is disconnected for more than 10 minutes , it automatically disables itself , which could potentially be an issue if a phone runs out of juice			0
@entity12 can be preordered for $ 55 , with an expected delivery time of 2014			2
later , it plans on selling the cards for $ 100 each .			1

@entity12 allows you to load up to eight cards onto a single plastic device
magnetic strip alters at the touch of a button meaning no need to carry individual *physical* cards
device costs $ 100 and will be launched next *summer*
not useful overseas where @entity166 , @entity167 and most of @entity168 use @entity61
