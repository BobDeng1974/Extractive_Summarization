by @entity0 when @entity1 set up her own acting agency she thought her two children would be the first in the limelight			1
but in fact it was the family dog which landed a leading role in @entity9			2
the @entity1 's pet @entity10 , an eight - year - old blue whippet , made his debut on the catwalk at the glittering @entity9 event for luxury brand @entity16			1
but he was not alone in his stage debut as he had 14 pet friends to join him in the forest - themed campaign			2
fashion hounds : @entity1 set up an acting agency with the intention of making her children famous - but after adding photos of her dogs to the site she found there was a demand for them tooo @entity1 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' i set up my own casting agency @entity34 after running a drama school for twelve months			1
' there is a shortage of agencies in the north and it seemed a natural progression			0
' i was just looking online and came across an ad in which they said they were looking for blue whippets for @entity9			1
' i have one and so does my friend so i emailed them and sent in their pictures			0
' it all went from there			0
we did n't find out all the details until much nearer the time			0
' they asked for the dogs ' collar sizes and then we had to sign a secrecy agreement so that gave us an indication it was a big event			0
' we were met at @entity60 hotel and the dogs were given a run through on the set			0
famous ! @entity64 with @entity65 , left of @entity64 , and her friend 's dog , @entity68 ' it was a forest theme so they tested them out with the dry ice and the loud music and photographers and they were absolutely fine with it all			2
' it was for the launch of the new @entity16 handbag and the face of the brand @entity64 was on stage with the blue whippets			1
' there were 15 in total for the event which was in @entity60 ' ballroom			0
' the dogs all had their own handlers			0
we realised how serious it was when we tried to leave the set for an hour and could n't get out for all the paparazzi trying to get in ! ' but for now @entity1 is happy for her pet pooch to be signed on the books and he now has a @entity16 collar to show for his efforts			1
@entity1 , who lives with her husband @entity99 and their two children @entity100 , 16 , and @entity103 , 14 , added : ' it 's another string to our bow			2
