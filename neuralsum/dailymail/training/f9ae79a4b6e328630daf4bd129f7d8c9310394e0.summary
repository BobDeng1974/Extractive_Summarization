@entity0 was lucky to stay on the pitch during @entity3 's surprise 5 - 3 defeat to @entity5 on @entity6 , after kicking out at @entity7			1
with the score at 4 - 2 the @entity9 defender was tussling for the ball with @entity5 ' two - goal hero when the striker fell to the floor			1
@entity0 , who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling @entity7 , took a swing at the forward , clattering him in the back			0
@entity0 and @entity7 fall to the floor as the pair struggle for the ball on the touchline after getting back to his feet @entity0 swings at @entity7 , who is still lying on the floor , between @entity0 and the ball the @entity9 defender makes a heavy contact with the @entity5 striker 's back , nowhere near the ball with the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how @entity0 could claim to have been attempting to play it , particularly with @entity7 's whole body between the defender and the ball			1
@entity0 then appeared to stamp on the prone forward 's leg , although that was at least closer to the ball , and could have been an attempt to retrieve it			0
however , referee @entity42 seems not to have seen the incident , failing to punish the centre half for the violent play			0
however , @entity0 's reprieve did his side little good , as @entity48 added a fifth goal to @entity7 's double , @entity51 's strike and @entity54 's penalty			0
@entity7 reacts in obvious pain , but neither the referee or his assistant seemed to notice the offence with @entity7 writhing on the floor , @entity0 then attempts to play the ball , but actually stamps on the forward 's led after the incident @entity0 , apparently repentent , checked that his opponent was not seriously hurt			2

@entity0 kicked @entity7 in the back with the score at 4 - 2
referee @entity42 took no action after the touchline *scuffle*
@entity0 then appeared to stamp on the @entity5 striker with the ball nearby
