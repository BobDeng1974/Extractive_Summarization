a 64 - year - old man finally looks like his identical twin after shifting five and a half stone in a year			2
@entity3 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , can now be compared to his slim brother @entity6 , after almost 25 years of looking nothing like him			1
the shower service engineer put on weight after giving up smoking at 40 years old , and the weight continued to creep on			1
slimmed down : @entity3 went to visit @entity6 and coincidentally turned up wearing an almost identical outfit to him			1
that was when they realised how similar they looked after his weightloss but after a hip replacement in april 2012 , mr @entity3 decided to lose weight to aid his recovery and joined his local @entity21 group run by team - leader @entity22			1
mr @entity3 said : ' i feel great and i wish i had done this years ago			1
' i look like a twin again and people can recognise us as brothers			0
' i went to visit @entity6 recently and his wife had never seen us looking similar			0
i had turned up wearing an almost identical outfit to him , so it was quite spooky			0
' she could n't believe it			0
' after starting his diet in june 2012 at a hefty 18 stone 1.5lbs , mr @entity3 adopted the @entity21 diet plan and started losing weight immediately			1
' i knew i wanted to lose weight and a friend in the @entity40 was on a diet with @entity21 over there			1
she suggested i find my local group so we could diet together and compare notes online			0
life - changing : @entity3 ( right ) gained weight when he gave up smoking 24 years ago			1
he began to look less and less like his brother but decided to shift the pounds when he had a hip replacement operation ' i was a bit nervous as these diet groups are often dominated by women , so i thought it might be intimidating being the only man			1
' a lot of the time i am the only man , but everyone is supportive and it 's worked			0
' mr @entity3 who measured up at a 42 - inch waist now boasts a slimmer 34 - inch trouser size , and is just 5lbs from his weight target at 12 stone 5lbs			1
' i was always a little bit chubbier than my brother growing up			0
even when we were born i was a pound heavier despite being identical			0
' but as children , and in our twenties and thirties people could n't tell us apart , especially if we were n't together			0
' but when i hit 40 i quit smoking and piled on the weight and we were n't recognised as twins anymore			1
all grown up : identical twins @entity6 and @entity3 , aged nine months old at @entity77 ' now i 've lost it again @entity6 thinks it 's great			1
i wish i had done this years ago			2
' mr @entity3 's weight loss plan consists of cutting down on fatty meat and eating lean meat and fish with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables , with each food having a point value			1
' i used to eat a lot of cheese and fatty meats such as pork and lamb , and sausages			0
' now i eat lean meat , and have cut down on my alcohol consumption			0
i 've also bought a bike and try to cycle 3 or 4 miles every day			0
' i retire next year so i 'm glad i have got fit in time to enjoy myself '			2
weight loss leader ms @entity22 herself made headlines in june for her seven stone weight loss			2
the mother - of - six started up a weight loss group after losing a lot of the weight while her soldier husband @entity106 was serving in @entity107			2
she said he barely recognised her when he returned			0
she added : ' it 's just amazing to see the photos of what @entity3 looked like before compared to what he looks like now , and he is happy which is great			2
