@entity0 is stepping somewhere between meshuga and chutzpah with a lament in her new book about how @entity5 in @entity7 's @entity6 are living ' under occupation			1
' in the memoir , due in stores on tuesday , @entity9 recounts a 1981 trip she took with her husband @entity14 between his nonconsecutive terms as governor of @entity17			2
' when we left the city and visited @entity22 , in the @entity6 , ' she writes in her book @entity24 , ' i got my first glimpse of life under occupation for @entity5 , who were denied the dignity and self - determination that @entity31 take for granted			1
' those are fighting words for any @entity31 politician who hopes to court @entity31 @entity36 voters			1
the last elected official to make the same gaffe was gov. @entity39 , the constantly embattled @entity41 @entity40			1
dumb choices ? ' @entity44 ' co-host @entity43 read aloud a passage from @entity0 's new book on monday , which describes the former secretary of state 's feelings about @entity7 's alleged ' occupation ' of @entity5 lands politically correct : @entity7 has built @entity36 settlements on a little more than 1 per cent of the disputed @entity6 territories , but it has become commonplace for politicians to refer to @entity54 as a wholesale ' occupier ' of @entity5 lands @entity39 recalled during a march 29 speech before the @entity57 that he had taken ' a helicopter ride from the occupied territories across ' in 2012 ' and just felt personally how extraordinary that was to understand , the military risk that @entity7 faces every day			1
' with the third - rail of @entity65 politics sparking , @entity39 made a hat - in - hand apology the following day to @entity67 , the über - wealthy conservative casino owner and serial campaign financier who had organizer the meeting			1
but @entity9 is n't expected to follow suit			0
during a broadcast of @entity73 's ' @entity72 on monday , a senior adviser to the @entity76 political action committee , which is laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign , insisted that @entity9 wo n't be falling on her sword			1
' does she owe @entity7 an apology for using the same language that @entity39 used and then had to apologize to @entity85 voters and pro-israel groups ? ' asked @entity43 , the conservative half of the show 's left - right anchor desk			1
' @entity0 is going to stand by the words in her book , ' said @entity92 , the @entity9 supporter			2
' she is not going to apologize for something she need not apologize for			0
' @entity43 was n't impressed			0
' then you think that she believes that the @entity5 territory is " occupied " ? ' @entity43 asked			2
' she 's not going to apologize for that , and she asserted that on purpose ? ' ' i 'm sure that when we all actually read the book and listen to her give these interviews , her words will stand for themselves , ' @entity92 shot back			0
' she said it twice in the book , ' chimed in @entity106 , executive director of the conservative @entity107			0
@entity106 co-authored an opposition - research - heavy book for his organization , and released it to coincide with @entity9 's			2
the title : failed choices trump card : @entity9 counts @entity7 prime minister @entity113 among her public supporters , with @entity113 saying in a 2012 tribute video that she ' is a strong and determined leader ; she 's principled and pragmatic ' co-host @entity116 , a veteran strategist from @entity9 's @entity117 days , insisted that the former first lady ' is very , very strong on ' @entity7			1
' if that 's the tree you guys want to bark up , i wish you luck , ' he said			0
@entity43 asked @entity92 , ' does ( @entity0 ) owe @entity7 an apology for using the same language that @entity39 used , then he had to apologize to @entity85 voters and pro-israel groups ? ” on @entity65 issues , secretary of state @entity9 painted a centrist self - portrait during her 2009 - 2013 time in office , and avoided clinging tightly either to @entity7 or to the @entity131			1
but on the thorny issue of @entity6 settlements , she wore president @entity135 's policy like a shield			2
in a may 2009 joint press conference with @entity139 's foreign minister , she said the @entity117 wanted ' to see a stop to settlements – not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions			0
... and we intend to press that point			0
' palestinians living in @entity6 cities like @entity148 , @entity22 and @entity149 believe they have a sovereign claim to landlocked territories west of the @entity153 river , saying that @entity7 is ' occupying ' @entity5 lands			1
@entity7 's position is that ' @entity156 ' has n't existed as a geopolitical entity since the @entity159 government ended its civil administration there in 1948			0
at most , @entity54 says , the land is ' disputed , ' not occupied			0
and that , @entity7 insists , means the land 's status must be negotiated , not mandated at the barrel of a gun or handed over under threats from @entity168 and other @entity170 organizations that the @entity31 sees as terror groups			1
@entity172 , a senior advisor to the @entity173 , insisted that @entity9 ' is not going to apologize for something she need not apologize for ' palestinians threw stones and burned tires on friday as they clashed with @entity7 security forces about @entity36 ' occupation ' of @entity5 - claimed land in the @entity6 in 1948 the @entity6 was declared part of @entity153 , but that country relinquished control of it 40 years later , stripping @entity184 of @entity153 citizenship			1
@entity7 has built settlements on just over 1 per cent of the @entity6 and maintains civilian and military control of about 7 per cent of the territory overall			1
armed clashes between @entity7 soldiers and @entity192 protesters are common in other areas of the @entity6 where @entity7 and the @entity131 share control			2
@entity9 , @entity116 pointed out monday , won praise from @entity7 prime minister @entity113 in a 2012 tribute video prepared for a public forum on @entity65 issues			2
' i 've just had the opportunity to work with her to achieve a ceasefire between @entity7 and @entity168 , ' @entity113 says in the video			0
' @entity0 is a strong and determined leader , she 's principled and pragmatic			0
... as someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks , i can tell you that i do n't think we 've heard the last of @entity0			0
' but the maybe - running @entity0 's book has already become more of a liability than an asset , with news networks procuring advance copies and interviewers leaning on her for news			2
in one embarrassing interview with @entity218 , she complained that she and president @entity9 were ' dead broke ' when they left the @entity117 in 2000			0
since then she has raked in $ 8 million in book earnings , and now charges $ 200,000 for public speeches .			0

@entity0 writes that in 1981 when she visited @entity22 , @entity5 ' were denied ... dignity and self - determination '
' i got my first glimpse of life under occupation for @entity5 , ' she writes in her memoir , ' @entity24 '
@entity41 gov. @entity39 took heat in march for referring to the @entity6 as ' occupied territories ' during a speech to wealthy @entity36 @entity40 *donors*
@entity39 apologized , but an adviser to the ' @entity76 ' presidential campaign *pac* insists @entity9 has said nothing she should feel sorry for
@entity5 partisans see territory on the @entity6 of the @entity244 as their land and claim it 's ' occupied ' by @entity7
israelis and most @entity31 @entity36 see them as ' disputed , ' insisting that there was no @entity5 state to ' occupy ' after the six - day *war* of 1967
the *contentious* issue and its *semantics* are at the heart of the @entity257 - @entity7 conflict
