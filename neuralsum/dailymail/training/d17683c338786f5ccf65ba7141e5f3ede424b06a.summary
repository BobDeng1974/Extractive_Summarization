at first glance , both photos resemble the familiar ruins of ancient @entity3 , instantly recognisable from the countless images printed in guidebooks and on postcards from @entity7			1
but while one picture does indeed capture a 2,500 - year - old monument to one of the world 's oldest civilizations - the other is a shocking example of the disappointing legacy of the @entity15			0
located in the @entity46 in @entity3 , the venue once hosted the canoe slalom events for the @entity7 @entity18 - which was estimated to cost the nation more than £ 6billion			1
it was comprised of a competition course , a training run , and a natural warm - up lake , all of which were surrounded by thousands of seats where the public could watch @entity18 stars compete			0
the drained course now lies in a state of disuse while for the last seven years the country has struggled through a depression , raising questions about how the nation has benefited from the multi-billion - pound event			2
former glory : just 15 days before the @entity15 began , teams carried out an operation named ' clean up - locked down ' in a bid to have the new venues looking perfect for the event			0
the scene is a far cry from what the arena looks like today abandoned : located in the @entity46 in @entity3 , the venue once hosted the canoe slalom events for the @entity7 @entity18 which was estimated to cost the country more than £ 6billion ruins : an aerial view of the @entity7 theatre at @entity81 , @entity82 of @entity83 in @entity84 , looks remarkably similar to the abandoned @entity18 venue the astonishing pictures were taken by @entity87 , 25 , a photographer from @entity3 who captured of images while exploring the @entity18 sports complexes in 2013 - less than a decade after the @entity18 took place			1
she said : ' as the particular sports were not popular enough after the @entity18 , the venues were left unused until they gradually ended up in complete decay			2
' few of the other venues had better luck , but in a general context , there was no proper planning with concrete solutions concerning the venues after the @entity18 , so they easily ended up neglected and unused			0
' left to nature : the astonishing pictures were taken by @entity87 , 25 , a photographer from @entity3 who captured the images while exploring the @entity18 sports complexes in 2013 - less than a decade after the @entity18 took place sad legacy : the arena , now in a state of disuse , was comprised of a competition course , a training run , and a natural warm - up lake , all of which were surrounded by thousands of seats where the public could watch @entity18 stars compete high price : the drained course has been left in a state of disuse while the country has struggled through a seven year depression , raising questions about how the nation has benefited from the multi-billion - pound event however , @entity87 , who now studies and works in @entity125 , @entity126 , still thinks @entity7 benefited from the @entity18 , despite the shocking reality her pictures reveal			1
she said : ' during the @entity18 , a huge infrastructural pattern including the @entity130 , the venues within the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , and the sports complexes in @entity134 and @entity135 were developed			0
' moreover , the @entity136 for football , @entity138 and the @entity139 ( site of the taekwondo , handball , indoor volleyball , and beach volleyball venues ) were constructed at the same time			0
' according to reports , the overall net economic benefit of the games for @entity7 was positive even if the post-olympics planning was not successful enough to make the use of all the sport venues manageable			2
' @entity151 said : ' according to reports , the overall net economic benefit of the games for @entity7 was positive even if the post-olympics planning was not successful enough to make the use of all the sport venues manageable ' @entity154 decline : the abandoned arena once hosted kayak and canoeing events at the @entity15 iconic : the @entity158 , built around @entity159 , at the @entity160 and @entity161 on @entity162 in @entity3 , appears to be in better condition than the @entity18 kayak venue built ten years ago @entity7 is famous for its ancient ruins and rich history			1
pictured , a sanctuary of ancient @entity7 in @entity168 , built in the 3rd century @entity24			1

shocking photos show how abandoned @entity18 venue bears eery resemblance to the @entity21 in @entity3
but while one was built in 4th century @entity24 , the other is just a decade old but has been left to be *reclaimed* by nature
games cost @entity7 more than £ 6billion but left little legacy , while for seven years country has struggled *financially*
