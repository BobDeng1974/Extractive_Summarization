the winter weather that is battering much of the country left a women 's college basketball team stranded on the sidelines - of the @entity5 interstate			1
players from the @entity8 women 's basketball team were traveling by bus from @entity10 , @entity11 , to their game against @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , yesterday			1
icy conditions brought traffic to a standstill on @entity19 near @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity5 , and the bus driver decided it was n't safe enough to continue			1
the team had already gone more than two miles when officers from the @entity26 found the @entity37 shortly after midnight and drove them the rest of the way to the @entity42			1
@entity8 's game with @entity13 was scheduled for 2pm today			2
@entity21 police chief @entity44 said his officers would try to get the team back to its bus in time to get to the game if the road conditions improved			2
it initially looked like the @entity37 were't going to make it for tip - off , but they did arrive on time			0
the stress did n't help them as they were down by eight points to the @entity58 at halftime and trailed by double digits for most of the second half before eventually losing the game 62 - 52			0
@entity63 scored 17 points for the winners during the contest			0
after the game today was initially cancelled because of ' inclement weather ' it actually began on time at 2pm			0
