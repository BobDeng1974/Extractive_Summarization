how do your fingers measure up ? if you ’re a man , it could reveal more about you than you thought			0
researchers say that the length of a man ’s index finger compared to his ring finger on his right hand is an indicator of his testicle size			1
and the study claims that the digit ratio could be used to predict testicle volumes of any male			0
men with larger testes were found to have longer ring than index fingers			1
the study was based on 172 @entity17 men aged 20 to 69 years old			1
in the image above , the man with hand on the left would have smaller testicles than the one on the right the study was carried out by @entity17 researchers from the @entity34 at @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity37			2
a previous study revealed that the size of men 's and women 's index and ring fingers is an indication of how attractive they are to the opposite sex			2
according to the findings , a woman whose index finger is longer than her ring finger is likely to have a symmetrical and more appealing face			0
for men , it is the opposite - those whose ring fingers are longer than their index fingers are more likely to be attractive to women			1
the discovery was made by @entity57 of the @entity58 , who measured the fingers of 100 men and women and photographed their faces using a digital camera			0
he used a computer programme to assess the symmetry of each face			0
they found that adult males with a ring finger longer than their index finger on their right hand had larger testicles			1
conversely , men with a longer index finger compared to their ring finger have smaller testicles			2
prior to the study it had already been suggested that second to fourth digit ratio correlated with the male reproductive system			0
this was based on the finding that @entity84 genes - which help lay out how a person ’s body takes shape - control finger development and genital development during the embryonic stage			0
previous research has suggested that the size of a man 's testicle correlates with the volume of semen he produces			0
in the study a total of 172 @entity17 men aged 20 to 69 years , already hospitalised for urological surgery , were enrolled			1
first , the researchers measured the length of the second and fourth digits of each participant			0
then , separately and independently , an experienced urologist measured their testes size			0
the results then showed that digit ratio was inversely proportionate to adult testicular volume - meaning that a longer ring finger correlated to larger testicles and vice versa			1
in the study the researchers also found that age and height did not have much effect on testicular volume , while weight had a marginal correlation			2
in the study the fingers and testicles of the volunteers were measured in size independently and highlighted the correlation between finger and testicle size			1
however in the research no correlation between testicle size and age or height was found			1
