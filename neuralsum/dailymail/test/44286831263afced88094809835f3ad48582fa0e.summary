will @entity0 has followed the lead of @entity3 's elite footballers and taken to using the world - class facilities at @entity5 to help him climb the @entity8 ladder			1
manor driver @entity0 was introduced to @entity5 by @entity9 , the training company founded by the four - time @entity12 champion and which has a partnership with the @entity15 - based centre where all 24 @entity3 teams train ahead of international fixtures			1
the 23 - year - old was a regular visitor last year as he looked to step up his fitness in preparation for a potential @entity8 drive , which came his way with now - defunct @entity23 in the final race in @entity25			2
will @entity0 has been using the facilities at @entity5 to help him climb the @entity8 ladder @entity0 has access to an exercise bike , treadmill and rowing machine , located in the altitude chamber @entity0 continued over the winter as he held talks with @entity34 prior to the @entity36 - based marque finally exiting administration in early march			1
due to @entity0 ' grand prix commitments he has been unable to visit @entity5 as much as he would like these past few weeks , although he is planning a trip over the summer months			1
' the facilities they have there are great , better than anywhere , ' said @entity0			1
' last year i spent quite a lot of time there because i needed to get myself ready if i had the opportunity to step up into @entity8			0
the main entrance to @entity5 , the @entity51 's Â£ 100m training complex the hydrotherapy suite has a main pool ( background ) , ice bath ( centre ) and jacuzzi ( foreground ) ' this year is a lot different because we need to manage the schedule to keep up my energy levels , when to train hard and when not to			1
' i 'll probably go there during the break because obviously the @entity65 @entity64 has gone			0
' there is a lot longer break in the middle compared to what it would be normally , so i 'll probably spend a week or so there			0
' i 'll have a fitness assessment for the first couple of days , and then after that i 'll work on the areas where i need to improve			0
@entity0 was a regular visitor last year as he looked to step up his fitness in preparation for a potential @entity8 drive ' they 've a heat chamber which is good and a really good underwater treadmill so you can do a lot more non-bearing stuff on your body			2
' if you 're training solidly for more than a week it 's good to do that kind of stuff			0
' if you are out running or whatever it 's obviously a lot harder on your body , and you can train a lot longer over the duration of the day rather than a few hours			0
' past use of the heat chamber will have a bearing for @entity0 this weekend as he competes in the @entity96			1
although an evening / night race when temperatures will be in the mid 20s centigrade compared to searing day - time highs of 36 , it will still be of benefit			2
the @entity34 driver is preparing to race in the @entity96 on sunday ' hydration is the number one thing			1
if you 're not hydrated you can lose concentration , ' added @entity0			2
' stuff like that is obviously something i need to keep on top of , which is why i 've people here to help me to manage everything like that			0
' i 've spent the last three days in @entity118 where the temperature was identical to here			0
' personally i much prefer being in the heat than the cold , so in terms of temperature i feel i wo n't have any issues at all			0
