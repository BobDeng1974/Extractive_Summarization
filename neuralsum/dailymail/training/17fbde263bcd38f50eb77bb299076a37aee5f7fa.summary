business secretary @entity21 ( right ) yesterday accused the @entity22 of ‘ lying ’ for suggesting that @entity24 ’s huge budget deficit can be paid off without the need for tax rises however , the party says it will enable it to reduce the need for spending cuts after the next election – and business secretary @entity21 yesterday accused the @entity22 of ‘ lying ’ for suggesting that @entity24 ’s huge budget deficit can be paid off without the need for tax rises			1
the new review goes much further than plans announced by the @entity7 at the weekend to raise £ 1billion for the @entity35 by reducing the lifetime allowance for pension tax relief from £ 1.25million to £ 1million			1
under the existing system , higher rate taxpayers get 40p tax relief for every 60p they save towards their pension			0
by contrast , basic rate taxpayers get just 20p for every 80p they save			0
under the new proposals , tax relief could be ‘ equalised ’ for all taxpayers at 25 or 30p in the pound			0
pensions minister @entity47 , who is carrying out the review , said the current policy ‘ can not be right ’			2
he said only part of the savings would be siphoned off to help pay down the deficit , with the rest recycled into more generous tax reliefs for basic rate payers			0
mr @entity47 said : ‘ some people would take a hit , but on the whole they are people who will still end up with very decent pensions			2
there would be more gainers overall			0
‘ we could probably spend less on pension tax relief overall – helping to contribute to deficit reduction – but also rebalance the money so that everyone , rich or poor , got help at the same rate			0
’ mr @entity0 added the current system meant that the better off were ‘ disproportionately ’ rewarded , but said the party was not ‘ committed ’ to the proposal yet			1
a recent report by the @entity74 think - tank suggested that scrapping higher rate relief could save the taxpayer £ 7billion a year , although mr @entity47 suggested the savings would be more modest			1

mr @entity21 launched a stinging attack on the @entity22 for pledging to pay off the deficit through public spending and welfare cuts alone			1

another @entity7 source confirmed lord @entity93 ’s name , saying that mr @entity0 had left the @entity22 ‘ under no illusions that his nomination would n’t be acceptable ’			2
calling for billions of pounds more spending on @entity24 ’s creaking infrastructure , he added : ‘ the truth is more taxes will be needed			2
to contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities			0
any politician who tells you that the next government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you			0
’ mr @entity21 also drew a line over immigration , saying more migrants were needed to help fuel the economic recovery			0
