by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 3 june 2013 council binmen failed to empty food recycling bins on an entire street for two whole months - because they could n't find the road with their new gps mapping system			1
in total , 28 sets of food recycling bins on @entity9 in the village of @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 , were left to rot for weeks on end despite the road being listed in the local a-z and other local maps			1
@entity19 refuse collectors claimed they found the street , built 50 years ago and situated just a few yards from the village 's main road , ' difficult to locate ' after being issued with new specialist mapping technology			1
angry : mother - of - three @entity27 , pictured outside her home on @entity9 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , said refuse collectors failed to empty food recycling bins on her street for eight weeks despite numerous complaints to @entity19 the oversight continued for eight weeks despite locals repeatedly complaining refuse collectors had failed to show for their fortnightly collections four times - leaving overflowing bins crawling with maggots and swarming with flies			1
binmen spotted by residents collecting from neighbouring streets on behalf of @entity19 also refused to empty the food recycling bins on @entity9 , saying : ' sorry , it 's not on my shift love			1
' residents claim the stench from the bins became so bad they did n't want to walk outside their homes			2
mother of three @entity27 , 44 , a doctors receptionist , said : ' we are a family of five so you can imagine how much food recycling we had accumulated			1
' everything goes in there			2
this has been a load of rubbish , quite literally			2
the flies were ridiculous and i had to leave the bin away from my house on the main road which i think i could have been fined for but i could n't leave it near my house , the stench was disgusting			1
' i do n't know what a dead body smells like but i imagine it to be like my bin			2
i could n't even walk past it			2
' mrs @entity27 added : ' when they did n't pick it up the first week i thought it was because they were still getting used to it so i did n't worry , but when the second fortnightly round did n't get collected we rang the council			2
we 'd never had a problem before but they said it was because it was a new crew - i do not think that is a good enough excuse			2
' ongoing : binmen failed to show up for their fortnightly collections of food recycling bins on @entity9 in @entity11 , @entity12 , at least four times the mother - of - three claimed she could see binmen collecting rubbish from nearby streets and it would have been impossible for them not to see @entity9			1
she said : ' i could see the binmen on their collections so how could they not see our street ? it is literally just off the main road so there 's no excuse whatsoever			1
they said that they did n't know where the street was but the streets just yards away were being emptied			1
' four out of the five of us in my family work and all pay our taxes , yet we are not getting the services we pay for			0
' @entity113 , a lot of the people in the street are quite elderly and they were dragging their bins out each fortnight only for them not to be collected			1
it makes me really angry			0
' mrs @entity27 said that she phoned the council numerous times and had been told that there would be an assisted collection to pick up the bins in the next two days			0
but , she claims , they never showed up			0
she continued : ' they just did n't show up and so i kept phoning			0
every time i called they said it had n't been listed			0
although it was a local number i am still forking out my own money ringing			1
@entity27 claims that binmen approached by @entity9 residents as they collected rubbish from other streets refused to help ' when i called back the second time they said my initial call had n't been registered but that they 'd do an assisted pick up yet that never happened either			1
i phoned numerous times over the period of eight weeks and phoned again every time it was n't collected			1
' when the binmen came to do an assisted collection for someone else an elderly lady came out and asked if they could take away hers but they told her , " sorry , it 's not on my shift love "			2
' they are just jobsworths , the least they could do while they were there is to give us a hand			0
these bins were full and i expect that there are rats close by , i do n't want to think about it			0
' it got to the point where it was defeating the object because i just could n't recycle any more because my bin was that full			0
it had to go in the grey bin which by rights i could have been fined for as it 's breaking the law			0
' after that we got the manager of recycling out to do a home visit and all the green bins were lined up			2
the smell was sheer disgusting , it was vile			0
in fact the smell is still there and i suggested that they pay for the bins to be professionally cleaned , i 'm even too disgusted to put my rubbish back in after the amount of maggots and flies and sludge in there			0
' another neighbour said the excuse that binmen could n't find the street - which was built in 1963 - was ridiculous			1
resident @entity196 , 59 , said : ' our green bin had n't been emptied for about eight weeks - there was rotting food and garden waste in there for ages			1
' it was really smelly and horrible			0
i rang the council three times but nothing happened			0
i do n't buy the idea that they could n't find us - this street has been here since 1963			1
' @entity19 said it has now emptied the bins			0
a spokesman added : ' recently introduced changes to the collection service meant that new crews were still learning new collection rounds			0
unfortunately @entity9 was missed by the crew as it was difficult to locate from their maps			1
' we would like to apologise to residents for any inconvenience			0
the issue has been highlighted to the new crews to ensure it is not missed on future collections			0
