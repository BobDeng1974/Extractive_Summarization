when he arrived at the @entity1 in 2010 , @entity0 was billed as the answer to @entity4 's striking problems			1
with 79 goals in eight seasons in @entity7 he had never been a prolific goalscorer at @entity8 , but the @entity9 offered @entity10 a plan @entity13 his hold - up play , and knack for scoring at important times , as shown by his five @entity15 strikes the previous season , suggested that @entity0 provided something different			1
alongside @entity18 , and with the supply coming from @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity0 was expected to help the @entity23 challenge for the title again			0
@entity0 , here wearing a protective facemask , has become an important player for @entity27 the @entity9 striker made an impressive start to his time at @entity4 , but soon faded away the @entity23 signed @entity0 after his impressive form for @entity8 in @entity32 and the @entity15 after scoring 10 times in his first 21 @entity23 appearances confidence was higher than ever , before the return of the previously injured @entity36 meant a spell on the bench , from which he never really recovered			1
three years , two loan moves and just one league goal later , @entity0 was allowed to leave , his confidence dented and his reputation in tatters			0
yet , as he prepares to face his former club again on saturday , the @entity9 has remodelled his game into the type of player that could really hurt the @entity23			2
@entity0 is no longer the @entity15 standard striker he once was , but instead is a hard - working midfielder , who can play off the front man			1
@entity0 's arrival , on a free transfer , was heralded as the potential for a new era of success at @entity4 the 31 - year - old has now moved to a more withdrawn role at his south @entity59 club , becoming a midfielder @entity0 scores a @entity15 goal at the @entity1 , one of 10 strikes in his first 21 @entity4 games despite just one @entity66 goal since joining @entity27 permanently this season , the 31 - year - old has been a crucial part of the south @entity59 club ’s plans			1
on the opening day of the season , in his first meeting with @entity4 since departing the @entity1 , he showed the @entity23 what he can offer these days , winning five tackles , and seven aerial duels			0
more remarkably he also got away with 11 fouls , ten of which came before his 67th minute booking			0
the goals soon dried up for the striker , who became second choice behind @entity18 on his return to the @entity1 earlier this season @entity0 committed a remarkable 11 fouls the converted striker was eventually booked for his tenth foul of the match , after upending @entity89 in other words he became the kind of player @entity4 so often need – a nuisance , who opponents hate but fans love to have on their side			1
when the @entity23 travel to @entity99 on saturday they can expect more of the same from the player who averages more fouls per game than anyone else in the @entity66			1
with @entity106 unavailable against his parent club , @entity0 is likely to continue in the first team			2
and with his confidence returned – as demonstrated by two goals against @entity111 last month - @entity10 knows he faces a dangerous opponent			0
‘ he ’s dropped off as well , he ’s not the target man any more , he ’s more a midfielder or second striker , ’ said the @entity4 boss of his former forward			2
‘ because he ’s a real team player @entity0 , that position suits him very well			0
now a midfielder , @entity0 has committed more fouls per game than any other @entity66 player despite selling the striker , @entity10 admits he always loved working with @entity0 while he was at @entity4 ‘ look , i loved him always because of his team attitude and he was a hard - working type			1
but in the end he did n’t play and you have to give the players a chance to go somewhere and play			0
‘ after , @entity18 came back from injury ( in 2010 ) and he was a bit a substitute [ and ] lost confidence			0
i ’m happy that he went to @entity27 and he is making a good career now			0
’ the @entity23 have more than replaced @entity0 , @entity135 offering the hold - up play that the @entity9 was expected to bring , as well as the goals and assists that eluded his predecessor			2
but though few @entity4 fans would want him back at the club , they will be aware that on saturday afternoon , their old player has every chance of causing them problems .			2

@entity0 signed for @entity4 in 2010 as a much - coveted striker
after a good start , @entity0 *drifted* out of the first team
the @entity9 has now been converted into a hard - working midfielder
@entity0 has committed the most fouls per game in the @entity66
@entity10 knows his former striker will cause problems on saturday
