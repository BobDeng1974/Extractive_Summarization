photographer @entity14 proposed to his girlfriend @entity15 at the top of the 3,470 metre high volcano burning passion : @entity12 in the @entity13 has a 2km wide crater filled with a lake of lava @entity24 said he could n't help but be motivated by the spectacular sight of the volcano volcanoes at @entity12 caused by the rifting of the @entity30 's crust where two parts of the @entity32 are breaking apart the dramatic pictures show smoke billowing from the 2km wide crater as the red and black lava bubbles away inside the lake			1
@entity14 , who was born in @entity2 but working in @entity38 , said : ' @entity15 came to visit me for a week and i had to choose whether to take her to the volcano or to see gorillas			1

after all , when you get a chance to see such a spectacle , you have to go for it			0
' we arrived in the afternoon and stayed over night			0
' the first time you catch a glimpse of the lava lake your jaws just drop			0
' nothing prepares you for the spectacle you 'll be treated with at night			0
' after retiring to our tents in the evening , i proposed			1

" ' that was welcomed with a full on " yes "			1
' he added : ' we started our descent that morning , when we had clear skies and i was able to take these photographs			0
' we felt privileged to experience such an amazing place and to witness the sight that unfolded in front of us			0
it was well worth the climb			0
' it 's a wonderful experience to see the earth at it 's rawest			0
