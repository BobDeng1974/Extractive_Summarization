regret : major @entity1 , pictured when he was made an @entity3 , said he misled listeners a @entity6 army officer whose emotional dispatches from @entity8 moved millions of radio listeners has hit out at penny - pinching politicians who he says cost the lives of his heroic troops			1
major @entity1 , whose broadcasts , dubbed @entity14 , revealed the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers from the @entity18 , says that a woeful lack of equipment led to the deaths of many men			1
the 41 - year - old former commander , who quit the @entity24 in 2012 , now says he believes his broadcasts deceived his audience because he did not highlight the fatal shortages of basic equipment			1
‘ by sticking to the @entity30 ’s line i misled the public , ' he admitted last night			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity34 , he accused the @entity30 of ‘ criminal negligence ’ for sending troops into battle without adequate protection			1
he also revealed how : @entity40 ’s claims are more damning because his 140 troops from @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity18 , were sent to the most dangerous area of @entity45 – @entity46 – where more @entity6 soldiers had died than anywhere else			1
under fire : the soldiers were working in @entity46 province , pictured , one of the most dangerous places on @entity54 the lack of armoured vehicles meant @entity40 ’s soldiers had to cross treacherous terrain on foot			1
inevitably they fell victim to enemy snipers and to improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) dug into paths and roads			0
five members of a @entity42 were killed , 35 wounded			0
yet while these shortages drove @entity40 to despair , he took to the airwaves of @entity72 ’s today programme to give a reassuring but misleading account of the provision of equipment			0
in a broadcast on today in march 2010 , @entity1 addressed concerns about troops not having adequate equipment			2
he told @entity72 listeners : ‘ i have an excellent rifle with a brand new sight , a new helmet , winter and summer kit that does the job and more			0
’ last night , a contrite @entity1 said : ‘ it is the equipment broadcast that really sticks in my gullet			2
i avoided all the contentious life or death issues which i knew about at the time			0
' reading the transcript now i feel a real sense of shame			0
by sticking to the @entity30 ’s line i misled the public about the equipment crisis gripping the soldiers in @entity8 at the time			2
‘ i regret giving the impression that everything was essentially ok , a sanitised version of the ground truth			0
claims : @entity104 said there were not enough armoured vehicles , which the @entity30 denied ' the lack of radios , armoured vehicles and bomb detection devices , which should have been made available for training purposes , cost soldiers ’ lives , as did a shortage of transport helicopters			1
' in at least ten examples of my troops being wounded or killed i regard the @entity30 as being criminally negligent			1
‘ for example from october to december 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine - resistant vehicles to use in @entity46 , the most dangerous place in the world			1
' we only had half the @entity124 radios we required and most soldiers only had personal radios , which worked over a range of 1,300ft			1
' @entity40 ’s concerns about kit first surfaced in pre-deployment training , when soldiers are supposed to practice using the life - saving equipment they will rely on in the warzone			2
‘ from october to december 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine - resistant vehicles to use in @entity46 , the most dangerous place in the world			1
we only had half the @entity124 radios we required and most soldiers only had personal radios , which worked over a range of 1,300ft			1
' - major @entity1 his troops required 35 mine detectors to meet the warzone ratio of one detector for every four soldiers , but got just three			1
this shortage led troops to simulate carrying a detector by waving broomsticks , wafting their arms about and making beeping noises			2
in another incident , the accidental shooting of lance corporal @entity154 by another @entity6 soldier showed the danger of not having enough radios			0
colleagues mistook @entity161 for an insurgent and , without a proper radio , a warning message could not be sent			0
last night , @entity1 described how he seethed as he listened to the evidence at @entity154 ’s inquest given by a colonel who was the @entity30 ’s expert witness on target identification			1
colonel @entity168 told the coroner that following the tragedy in december 2009 the @entity24 had upgraded an infrared identification system carried by soldiers and was looking at introducing better , more reliable radios			1
@entity1 said : ‘ i was fuming			2
i knew that upgrade had not taken place			0
colonel @entity168 ’s evidence misled the coroner and @entity161 ’s family			0
’ one in four users of the @entity182 bomb detector in @entity46 died , including @entity183 ( pictured ) ‘ i have looked up the chain of command for anyone who might be big enough to accept this [ responsibility for @entity154 ’s death ]			2
i do n’t any more			0
‘ the generals , civil servants and politicians seem to have no desire to accept the consequences of their actions or inactions			0
’ last night , an @entity30 spokeswoman said : ‘ we strongly dispute these claims and can confirm the comments made by @entity199 at the inquest			1
‘ at that time we had upgraded infra - red identification equipment and were in the process of procuring further new equipment to help ensure a similar incident could not happen again			0
’ @entity40 has written a book attacking the @entity30 over equipment failures and tactics used against the @entity208			1
‘ @entity209 ’ will be serialised in @entity34			0
killed : lance corporal @entity154 was 22 @entity1 says : ‘ on the night of @entity213 @entity154 ’s death , the section commander ’s radio stopped working and none of the soldiers on @entity154 ’s patrol had a back - up radio capable of sending a message to the @entity6 sniper before he fired the fatal shot which killed @entity221			1
' he thought he was shooting at @entity208 fighters who appeared to preparing a roadside explosive device 2,500ft away			2
‘ actually he was shooting at his own men – @entity221 and another soldier who survived the incident			0
’ at an inquest , a coroner blamed military ‘ failures ’ for @entity154 ’s death			2
‘ to use a bomb detector effectively when you ’re under enemy fire takes hundreds of hours of practice , ’ @entity1 says			1
due to kit shortages only three devices , known as @entity236 , were available to his 140 men to train on before they deployed to @entity8			2
he adds : ‘ so my soldiers had less time to use the equipment			0
waving a stick was no substitute for practising with a bomb detector			0
’ in @entity46 , one in four @entity182 operators , including rifleman @entity183 , were killed or seriously injured			0
‘ i sent 25 soldiers on driving courses so they could use the @entity248 , an armoured vehicle which provides protection against mines , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ when we got to @entity46 there was not one armoured or mine - proof vehicle in our base			1
we were furious and felt bitterly let down , having been told that we would be able to use @entity248			0
this was a disgrace – these vehicles would have saved lives			0
so for months we walked everywhere and were very vulnerable			0

major @entity1 , 41 , made the claims after quitting @entity24 in 2012
he accuses @entity30 of ' criminal negligence ' for leaving troops *unprepared*
he says lack of bomb detectors , radios and armoured vehicles cost lives
hundreds of soldiers were sent to the most dangerous area of @entity45 without a single armoured or mine - resistant vehicle , and with half the *quantity* of radios they required .
troops who would have to search for deadly @entity208 mines using metal detectors had to train using broomsticks , leaving them woefully ill - prepared when on the **frontline** . one in four soldiers using the detectors were killed or suffered terrible injuries .
he fumed with anger as he watched a @entity295 *mandarin* tell an inquest into the death of one of his soldiers that kit problems had been solved .
a quota system for *gallantry* medals meant top brass who were miles from the **frontline** won awards , while *junior* soldiers involved in fierce fighting against the @entity208 lost out .
