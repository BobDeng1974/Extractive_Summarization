probe : police have today revealed an independent investigation will now consider whether former @entity5 @entity4 mp @entity3 's child abuse was covered - up police have today revealed they are chasing up to 11 new suspects linked to sex abuse by former @entity9 mp @entity3			1
@entity6 has said it will also review evidence of claims that @entity3 was subject to a top - level cover - up spanning 35 years , including by @entity15 agents			1
it came as the @entity5 came under further pressure over their former mp after even his family called for an independent inquiry into allegations he had abused boys			1
police are already investigating allegations of historic sex abuse by @entity3 in @entity4 , where he was an mp for 20 years			1
but it has today announced that it is looking into claims that abuse may have been swept under the carpet by officials and politicians in @entity34 between 1961 and 1995			2
the review will be carried out by a @entity36 , with any evidence of criminality then passed to the police , who say they are ' trying to trace ' others who may have abused children or helped hide it			2
detectives will review a range of sources , including allegations in the book by current @entity4 mp @entity49 , serialised in the @entity50 , which claimed police , politicians and even @entity15 had been involved in a cover - up			1
mr @entity49 said : ' the scandal is that nothing has been done for so many years , and what we now need is some action by the local authority and by the police to ensure that it ’s bought to a conclusion			0
' officers are already investigating claims of abuse at @entity66 residential school , which closed in 1992 , but are now to review whether any evidence points to a cover - up by the council			1
@entity34 is due to hear the findings of an independent review into the running of @entity66 next month			2
officers are also looking into claims he abused boys at the privately run @entity79 children ’s care home , which closed in 1965			0
@entity6 chief constable sir @entity80 : ' as a result of the publicity and the discussion around the book recently published about child abuse in @entity4 , we are carrying out a review into those allegations and into other matters of public debate around that book to see whether that justifies a criminal investigation into allegations of ( a ) cover - up			1
' there are a significant number of people we are trying to trace , obviously made more difficult by the passage of time			0
' given the degree of public speculation around this particular book and the allegations made in it , we think it would clearly be strange if we did not look at that and carry out a review as to whether that justified a wider criminal investigation			0
' fury : @entity111 ( left ) , the brother of @entity3 ( right ) , has slammed the abuse claims allegations about sir @entity3 ’s conduct were first published in 1979			2
in a statement , his family said they did not believe the claims against him – but would be happy to co-operate with a proper inquiry			0
the intervention is uncomfortable for deputy prime minister @entity121 , who has rejected calls for such a probe			1
last week he urged the police to investigate whether there had been an @entity127 cover - up of @entity3 's activities			1
but he rejected calls for a full inquiry , headed by an independent figure , or for the @entity5 themselves to hold their own probe , saying only the police could do the job properly			1
yesterday @entity135 , the party 's president , claimed that if the @entity5 held their own probe it would ' interfere ' with the police inquiry			1
but pressure intensified as a former president of the @entity9 claimed there was a culture of ' cowardice ' that protected @entity3 from allegations of abuse in the same way as the @entity147 protected @entity148			1
@entity149 said rumours of @entity3 's sex attacks on boys had reached senior figures , but then leader @entity154 took no action because the leadership had their ' heads in the sand '			1
and he accused mr @entity121 of being ' more than naïve ' for lauding the former @entity4 mp on his death			2
@entity3 is the subject of two police inquiries into child abuse			2
the @entity164 say they believe @entity3 , who died in 2010 , did carry out attacks			0
the @entity166 released a statement on saturday , saying they would welcome an inquiry			0
' we find many of the claims bizarre and difficult to believe , an independent inquiry would determine their truth or otherwise , ' it said			0
' the person they are describing is not the person known to family , friends , colleagues and constituents			0
' @entity3 's brother @entity111 , a former mayor of @entity4 , said : ' i do n't believe any of these outrageous claims			1
they 're so shocking i do n't know how they could have been hidden at the time			0
' i think these people were damaged and they are just trying to ruin his reputation now when he ca n't defend himself			0
i think it is despicable			0
' mr @entity135 has admitted the @entity5 face ' serious questions ' over who knew about allegations against @entity3			1
but he rejected calls for both an inquiry and for the party to hold an internal probe , saying the matter should be left to the police			1
' it 's very , very important that the police are allowed to proceed with full investigations without any kind of hampering or speculation on a political level , ' he told @entity206			2
mr @entity149 was president of the @entity207 from 1986 to 1987 , and led the @entity5 ' election campaign in 1992			2
in an article for a sunday newspaper he praised a book by current @entity4 mp @entity49 for exposing @entity3 as ' a serial sexual abuser of small boys '			0
mr @entity149 said @entity154 , who was @entity9 leader between 1976 and 1988			0
did not take action because he ' hated confrontation '			0
he said @entity9 mps at the time included a drunk , one who would hang around clubs with attractive boys , and a number who were having affairs with their secretaries			0
all this meant there was no appetite to challenge @entity3 .			0

@entity34 , police and @entity15 accused of cover - up of abuse at schools and home
police have *identified* up to 11 new suspects ' they wish to trace '
@entity3 's own family has called for probe into what the @entity5 knew
intervention is uncomfortable for deputy prime minister @entity121
he rejected calls for a full inquiry , headed by an independent figure
pressure intensified as former @entity9 president claimed there was a culture of ' cowardice '
