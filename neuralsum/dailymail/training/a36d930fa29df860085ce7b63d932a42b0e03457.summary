by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 7 february 2013 a disabled woman was barred from a tribunal to decide whether she was entitled to benefits – because she was in a wheelchair			0
@entity5 , 65 , was turned away by security staff in case a fire broke out in the five - storey building			1
it later emerged that wheelchair users have been denied entry to @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , for three months over the misplaced health and safety concerns			0
they included others attending disability tribunals and workers attempting to visit offices in the mixed - use block			2
ridiculous : court officials at @entity13 in @entity14 banned @entity5 , 65 , from attending her own disability tribunal because she was in a wheelchair ‘ they said they could n’t guarantee my safety and they did n’t let my wheelchair upstairs , ’ said miss @entity5 , who was summoned to the fourth - floor hearing by the @entity28 to be reassessed for @entity29			1
‘ why are they holding disability tribunals in a building disabled people are n’t allowed in ? ’ @entity38 has been without her £ 50 - a - week payments since december 2011 when they were suspended after an ‘ administration error ’			1
she has been managing on her £ 140 - a - week pension in her two - bedroom bungalow in @entity44 , @entity15 , while waiting for the benefit to be reinstated			2
after she and her son , @entity46 , were refused entry on february 2 she was told she would have to wait another two months for her case to be heard – this time 12 miles away in @entity49			1
apology : this is a letter which was sent to ms @entity5 by the tribunals service the mother of two developed crippling arthritis in her knees , neck and back after a 30 - year career as a factory worker			1
‘ what angers me is that i am not one of those people who wants to sponge off the state , ’ she said			2
‘ i have been working since the age of 15 – i had my two children and went straight back to work			0
angry : @entity5 , 65 , was told she could not attend the fourth - floor courtroom for a hearing to reinstate her disability living allowance due to barmy health and safety fears ‘ i got a job packing boxes but my arthritis got so bad i could n’t stand up any more			1
i was assessed and the doctor said i needed help			0
’ other wheelchair - bound people who have been banned from the building include office worker @entity79 , 33			1
he said : ‘ i was a bit taken aback because i ’ve worked here for 11 years and spent at least eight of them on the first floor			2
‘ a security guard told me i was n’t allowed upstairs because they needed to build an external lift to evacuate people in wheelchairs in the event of a fire			1
‘ i thought that was a bit odd because they always tell you not to use lifts if there ’s a fire			0
‘ we ’ve actually got an evacuation chair right next to my desk in case there ’s a fire , ’ he added			1
@entity106 yesterday admitted there had been a mistake			0
a spokesman said : ‘ due to a misinterpretation of health and safety legislation by a security contractor a limited number of users with mobility issues have wrongly been refused entry			0
‘ we have taken immediate action to ensure that this does not happen again and we apologise to those affected			0
‘ full access to the tribunal is now being facilitated for users with mobility issues			0
’ the spokesman added a written apology had been sent to miss @entity5 – although she complained the date and venue for her rescheduled appointment had not been changed			2
employers and service providers have been required to make ‘ reasonable adjustments ’ to aid access to goods , services , education and transport since the @entity136 .			0

@entity5 was told she could not attend the fourth - floor courtroom
only people able to escape down stairs in case of fire were allowed in
' it *'s* *absolutely* ridiculous , ' said the 65 - year - old
