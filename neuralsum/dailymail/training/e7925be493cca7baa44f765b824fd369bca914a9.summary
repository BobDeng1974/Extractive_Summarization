by @entity0 @entity1 claims @entity3 silver medallist @entity2 has ' embarrassed ' the best of the rest @entity6 sprinters into stepping up their performances			1
@entity1 , a former @entity10 relay gold medallist and @entity12 runner - up over 200 metres , believes the emergence of @entity16 ace @entity14 , a struggling footballer who found his true talent was in athletics , has shaken up the domestic scene			1
and he also claims women 's sprinting in @entity6 is close to a peak , after a period in his career when he contends the fastest home - grown female athletes were obsessed with ' looking pretty ' above racing quick times			1
rise : @entity1 believes @entity6 sprinters should be embarrassed by @entity2 's success @entity1 told @entity31 : ' you let a former footballer come into our sport , who 's not gone through the junior ranks , through @entity38 , or anything like that			1
he 's just come in having trained for six months and he 's the best in @entity6			2
' you should be embarrassed , the rest of you			2
you need to step it up			0
they 're all having to step it up			0
you need the extra encouragement , the extra belief that anything is possible			0
' with the women , from what i remember being back in the team , too many of them were bothered about getting in the team , getting the kit , and looking pretty			0
close : @entity56 's @entity55 beats @entity16 's @entity14 in to first place in the men 's 100m final ' but now with this current crop , no , they 're inspired by what they 've witnessed from @entity63			1
they 've realised they can be the best in the world			0
' you look at the likes of @entity69 going to the @entity70 and becoming world junior champion			0
' they realised if they put in the work , train hard , they can be the best in the world			0
the girls are leading the way , and i think the times they performed over the 4x100m relay has given them the extra bit of confidence that they can beat the best in the world , and that 's what it 's about : belief			2
' future : @entity1 believes @entity6 's @entity69 ( right ) is leading the way for @entity90			1
