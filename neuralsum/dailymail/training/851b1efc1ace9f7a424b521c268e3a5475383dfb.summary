by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 24 august 2013 a baby died after his brain was starved of oxygen when midwives failed to notice he had been born under his mother ’s bed sheets			1
@entity7 was overlooked because his mother @entity8 had been given a double - strength epidural and could not feel anything below her waist			1
he was found ‘ looking blue ’ eight hours after she was induced			0
@entity13 with her @entity14 , who was born on october 23rd , 2008 at @entity15 in @entity16			1
he died of a catastrophic brain injury after staff failed to notice he had been born under bed sheets @entity20 and @entity13			2
a coroner recorded a narrative verdict in which he highlighted eight specific failings which led to their baby 's death the boy suffered a catastrophic brain injury in the delay and died six months later			2
mother @entity8 , 32 , died the following year from complications giving birth to her second child			2
yesterday hospital bosses agreed to pay a five - figure out - of - court settlement after admitting responsibility for the boy ’s death in may 2009			1
last night his father @entity20 , 35 , criticised the hospital which repeatedly refused to admit liability and apologise before accepting they were at fault in april			0
this has been an extremely difficult four years for my family , ’ he said			0
‘ my wife died never knowing what happened ( or ) that anyone was sorry for our loss			0
‘ we lost a much loved son under horrific circumstances			0
‘ we fought so hard and waited so long to receive an apology and an admission that more could have been done to save him			0
‘ no amount of money could ever replace what we have lost but we are now finally in a position to move forward with our lives			0
we feel that in some small way justice has been done			0
’ mrs @entity13 , who suffered from diabetes , anaemia and a range of other health problems during her pregnancy , was flagged as a ‘ high risk ’ case when she was admitted to @entity15 in @entity16 in october 2008			1
although she was 34 weeks pregnant , doctors decided to induce the baby after becoming concerned his growth had slowed			0
an inquest into @entity14 ’s death , in april , was told that mrs @entity13 was given an epidural several hours into her labour for the pain , but a consultant anaesthetist agreed to first perform a ‘ spinal block ’ so she would sit still enough to have the epidural needle inserted			1
this amounted to a double dose of pain relief , the coroner was told			0
but midwives failed to regularly monitor mrs @entity13 and when they went to attach a foetal scalp electrode they pulled back the bed covers and discovered @entity14 had been born			2
mrs @entity13 ’s sister @entity87 told the inquest : ‘ when i looked round at the bed the cord was stretched down and the baby was between her legs and was blue			1
’ although @entity14 was born with some medical problems , the delay in resuscitation caused avoidable brain damage			0
an internal investigation concluded that staff at @entity15 failed to communicate effectively during handovers , failed to fully acknowledge and respond to mrs @entity13 's medical needs and failed to properly and regularly assess the progress of her labour			1
mr @entity7 has now reached an out - of - court settlement coroner @entity103 delivered a narrative verdict and listed eight failings by the hospital , including a failure to recognise the baby was in distress , delay in summoning a senior doctor and a failure to effectively monitor and examine mrs @entity13 properly			1
yesterday , mr @entity7 ’s solicitor , @entity113 , said it was unacceptable that the hospital had waited four years before admitting they were to blame			1
@entity116 , of @entity15 said : ‘ we have recognised there were failings surrounding the care of @entity7 and accept that this fell below the level we normally provide			2

@entity7 was born in 2008 at @entity15 in @entity16
his mother was unable to feel anything from the waist down *due* to epidural
*remained* in the *intensive* care unit throughout his life and died a year later
delay in staff noticing and acting to resuscitate him meant he suffered further avoidable injury , an inquest heard
*tragically* , mrs @entity13 has since died , just months after the birth of the couple ’s second child in *january* 2010 , from *multiple* organ failure
mr @entity7 has now reached an out - of - court settlement with hospital
