he bought @entity2 ’s knicker - strewn bed and @entity4 ’s pickled shark			2
but will millionaire art collector @entity5 have the same appetite for an emerging painting genre : ‘ throttle art ’ ? seven paintings depicting the infamous moment last year when mr @entity5 was caught apparently throttling then wife @entity9 are available via his own art sale website			1
one of the images available on the website is called @entity15 , pictured , by @entity16 and is available for £ 5,870 @entity17 , which is closely connected to his @entity19 gallery , shows one such painting available for $ 30,000 ( £ 17,600 )			1
little - known artists have also uploaded their depictions of the assault			2
mr @entity5 stands to gain from the sale of the works , as he is a minority shareholder in @entity28 – a fact that angers anti-violence campaigners			1
it is just over a year since the 71 - year - old was photographed with his hands around ms @entity9 ’s throat as they dined at @entity36 ’s in @entity37 , @entity19			1
mr @entity5 subsequently accepted a police caution for the incident			1
the photograph caused a sensation and led to the couple ’s acrimonious divorce last november			0
but mr @entity5 is seemingly unfazed by the paintings			1
in an email to @entity46 , he said : ‘ would it have been a better story if i had censored artists whose work might be personally disobliging ? ’ when asked if he thought ‘ throttle art ’ might be a new genre destined to take off , he added : ‘ there are 40,000 artists who showcase their work on the site , so i think it ’s a bit of a micro genre			2
’ a painting on the website called @entity62 , by @entity63 , is pictured left , while another version of the scene in @entity37 was painted by @entity66 and called @entity67 , right - available for £ 1,170 but @entity68 , chief executive of women ’s aid , said : ‘ domestic violence is not a trivial matter			1
it is extremely insensitive to all victims of domestic violence for someone who has accepted a police caution for assaulting a partner to earn commission on images of the offence			1
we are shocked that anyone would want to make a profit from images of abuse			2
’ @entity16 , 41 , a member of the @entity87 movement , uploaded his @entity89 - style painting of the infamous scene to @entity28 after seeing the pictures in a newspaper			1
it is on sale for $ 10,000 ( £ 5,870 )			2
he said : ‘ it ’s not really controversial			0
@entity15 is strangling @entity9 but it ’s also about him squeezing the art market			1
it works on many levels			0
it ’s a comment on the art market and how people control it			0
’ and @entity63 , 52 , decided to list two paintings depicting the photograph			0
last course is a portrait of ms @entity9 with hands on her throat painted on a bread board			1
he is also selling @entity110 , an oil painting , for $ 30,000 ( £ 17,600 )			1
‘ when those pictures hit the newspapers that photo said , “ come and paint me , ” ’ mr @entity63 said			0
‘ it ’s not the best execution , but that ’s not what ’s important			0
it ’s ironic that this picture is for sale as art and there ’s mr @entity5 lining his pockets from it			1
he ’s profiting from that image			0
’ a drawing called @entity128 is also on the website with an asking price of £ 150 @entity66 , 58 , listed her oil painting last june			1
‘ i was surprised it stayed up there , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m sure @entity15 does n’t want a picture of him throttling his wife on his own website			2
i put it on there to have a laugh at @entity15			0
’ she sold @entity140 , advertised for £ 2,000 ( £ 1,170 ) , to @entity142 collector and retired @entity144 official @entity143			2
he also bought her controversial painting of @entity146 several years ago			0
‘ he ’s got both @entity9 being throttled and @entity146 in his living room , ’ ms @entity66 said			1
anyone can create an account on the online gallery and start selling their work from $ 100 to $ 30,000			0
if it sells , the user receives 70 per cent while @entity28 takes a 30 per cent commission			0
the website states that users must not upload anything that is ‘ defamatory ’ or ‘ offensive ’ or that is ‘ violent or threatening or promotes violence ’			0
but so far none of the works has been taken down			0
when asked why the works depicting violence were not removed , @entity164 , chief curator at the online gallery , said : ‘ @entity28 does not believe in censorship unless the material is pornographic or incites racial hatred			0

paintings show moment @entity5 was apparently caught throttling @entity9
