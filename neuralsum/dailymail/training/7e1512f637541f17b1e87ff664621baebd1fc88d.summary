by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent ministers are to risk a major row over immigration by scrapping the ten - yearly @entity5 after more than 200 years			1
an announcement axing the survey is expected this month , together with moves to find cheaper ways of counting the population			1
but the government faces accusations of trying to hide the truth about immigration			1
ten - yearly @entity5 that counts the number of people living in @entity17 will be scrapped after 200 years the future of the census has been in question since the disastrous 2001 survey led to bureaucratic chaos and a final population figure at least a million short of the reality			1
the @entity25 has been exploring replacements based on ‘ administrative data ’ , which could include @entity28 and tax and benefit records and the electoral roll			2
however , officials also want to use the vast databases run by private sector organisations to supplement publicly - held information			2
the @entity25 has canvassed the idea of tapping into information held by internet search engines such as @entity39 and the databases of corporations such as @entity42 and the energy supply giants			0
the results of the consultation will be made public later this month			1
sir @entity46 of the @entity48 think - tank warned that the proposals ‘ need to be examined very closely ’			0
‘ there must be no question of burying the truth about the scale of immigration , ’ he said			1
critics of the proposal to scrap the census ( pictured in 2011 ) say it is the most accurate measure of population @entity60 , professor of human geography at @entity61 , called the idea ‘ stupid ’			1
in an article for the journal @entity65 , he said the 2011 census had confounded analysts who believed that the @entity25 had been over-estimating the population because it has been better at counting immigrants than emigrants			1
sir @entity46 of @entity48 said getting rid of the census could be to ' bury the truth about the scale of immigration ' ‘ the 2011 census told us that the opposite had in fact occurred , ’ said professor @entity60			1
‘ @entity25 had been under - estimating the population and there were far more people living in the @entity17 than they thought			2
’ ' the 2011 census showed us that the population of the @entity17 was rising , still slowly , but faster than the @entity25 had thought , and faster than almost anywhere else in @entity84			2
‘ without knowing that fact we could not speculate in a sensible way as to why that might be happening			0
’ the 2011 census showed that there were 56.1million people in @entity91 and @entity92 , 3.7million up in a decade , and half a million more than official estimates			0
the @entity25 acknowledged that almost all the half - million were eastern @entity84 immigrants who were not detected by regular @entity96 surveys			0
the first census was taken in 1801 amid fears that a rising population would bring starvation and revolution			2
it has been held every ten years since – apart from 1941 – but has become a costly exercise			0
the 2011 headcount cost £ 500million			0
professor @entity60 said that a reason for scrapping the census could be to stop embarrassing social studies , such as those finding that the poor are becoming increasingly less healthy than the well off			0
‘ one of the reasons you might choose not to have a census is if you wanted the kinds of studies that relied on census data not to be undertaken , ’ he said			0
he said it was wrong to replace the census with inadequate surveys , saying ‘ the politically devious way to cut something is to cut it , but claim that it is continuing			0
