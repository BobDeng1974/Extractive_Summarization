there will come a time , hopefully soon , when @entity1 accepts that the role of the television analysts and newspaper columnists is to pass comment on key decisions			1
here at @entity8 there were four moments - minute 18 , minute 23 , minute 46 and minute 56 , as @entity1 refers to them - that affected the direction of this game			1
‘ pundits are pundits and managers are managers , ’ explained @entity14 ’s manager after his team had been held to a 1 - 1 draw by an engaging and adventurous @entity18 team at @entity8			1
@entity1 may one day accept that the role of pundits is to pass comment on key decisions yet again , after @entity1 's @entity14 drew with @entity18 , @entity1 attacked his critics ‘ pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i ’m not paid to wear their suit or comment on their comments			1
‘ if one day i become a pundit i will wear a manager ’s suit and win every game because that ’s what pundits do			2
i can be phenomenal , like they are			0
’ he really has a bee in his bonnet over the role of @entity36 or @entity38 ’s @entity37 , gravely offended that anyone could dare to criticise his tactics or his team			1
and so it goes on			0
this is @entity44 and as unappealing as this will sound to @entity14 ’s manager , the match officials are also tiring of his constant complaints			1
here @entity47 , the latest poor sap given the onerous duty of refereeing the @entity51 leaders , was pretty much spot on			1
he made honest decisions for heaven ’s sake , not judgments designed to haul @entity57 , @entity58 or @entity59 back into the title race			0
referee @entity47 was lumped with taking charge of @entity14 and on key decisions was pretty much spot on @entity47 awarded this penalty to @entity18 , scored by @entity65 , which did n't please @entity1 @entity14 were a goal to the good through @entity69 when @entity1 ’s faithful servant @entity70 was sent down the tunnel to watch the television replay of the decision to award @entity18 a penalty when @entity75 fouled @entity76			1
a few days ago , in the boisterous atmosphere of the second leg of their @entity81 clash with @entity82 , @entity14 ’s players were guilty of kettling @entity84 referee @entity83 to get @entity85 sent off			1
here they largely kept their cool , with captain @entity87 the only player in a blue shirt to contest the decision to award @entity18 the chance to level			2
‘ my view is not important because what is important is the referee ’s view , ’ claimed @entity1			1
in any event , @entity65 equalised			0
@entity69 appeals for a penalty that would have seen @entity98 sent off had it been awarded the biggest bone of contention was the failure of @entity47 to spot the delicate tap on @entity104 inside the penalty area when @entity18 ’s goalscorer @entity65 flicked out a boot			1
‘ @entity36 says it ’s worse if a player asks for a yellow card than if a player kicks someone in the chest — that ’s what he says — so my opinion is not opinion			0
what is important is mr @entity47 and his decision was no penalty on @entity104			2
’ there was , to @entity1 ’s credit , a weary sigh when he was asked whether the decision to replace the sluggish figure of @entity75 with @entity127 was to avoid an inevitable dismissal			2
@entity75 was booked in the first half for his challenge on @entity76 and should have been sent off when he clattered into @entity18 ’s deep - lying forward in the 46th minute			1
as ever , there was a sting in the tail			0
@entity98 calls for @entity104 to be booked for a dive but replays showed he been clipped by @entity65 ‘ when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow would come , ’ admitted a doleful @entity1			1
‘ with fast players like @entity76 coming out of midfield , driving the ball , that could happen			0
if you remember @entity127 ’ red card against @entity145 , obviously you are afraid of it			0
’ it is these comments , designed to twist the knife , that get people ’s goat			0
there is no agenda and no - one is out to get @entity14			1
as for the 56th - minute incident when @entity18 captain @entity98 tackled @entity69 , you can make a case for either			2
‘ you have to control me here ... ’ claimed @entity1			2
@entity75 was booked for the foul that gave away the penalty and should have got a second and sent off later on he made no mention of @entity69 ’s reaction — shoving @entity98 in the chest as the pair waited for a corner kick to be taken in front of the @entity164			0
‘ @entity165 told me their pundits said it was a penalty , then i went to @entity168 and they said it was n’t a penalty , ’ he said			2
‘ i went to do the radio and they said it was n’t			0
now i come here and i think you ’re saying it ’s not a penalty			0
i ’m not jumping with happiness and not crying with disappointment			0
’ instead , it was just more of the same .			0
