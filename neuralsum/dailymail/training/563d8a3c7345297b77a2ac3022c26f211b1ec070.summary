by @entity0 as if the retirement of sir @entity2 was n’t disorientating enough , now comes a proper bombshell , the news that after nearly 40 years another @entity5 , @entity6 , is retiring from reading the classified football results on the radio			1
' it 's with great sorrow that i have to give up the most exciting part of my career , the classified football results , ' said the @entity15			1
' they have been my life			2
' sports report without @entity19 ? that ’s almost too much to take			2
after all , we football enthusiasts over the age of 45 practically grew up listening to @entity6 mellifluously intoning @entity24 1 @entity25 1			2
hanging up his mic : @entity6 is one of the most recognisable voices on radio thanks to him and the late @entity29 , who did the same job on @entity31 for aeons , saturday teatimes acquired a reassuring certainty that was only threatened by the occasional freak result you could n’t predict after they ’d read the home team ’s score			1
usually , gloriously , the inflection would tell you exactly what was coming			0
but just occasionally the football gods threw a quirky one into the mix , like @entity46 3 @entity45 7			0
@entity6 , of course , always took it entirely in his stride			0
@entity46 dropped out of the @entity50 in 1978 , but they were my home - town team and for all the years that they languished in the old @entity56 , @entity6 ’s fleeting weekly mention gave me untold pleasure whether they won , lost or drew			1
it seemed like a validation not just of where i lived , but who i was			0
moreover , there was and still is a romance about the less conventionally named teams with which he will forever be associated			0
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , those were names to conjure with , and the two ronnies famously did			0
to relish their football results sketch — @entity80 1 @entity79 0 , @entity81 2 @entity82 - as - a - @entity75 1 , and the immortal half - time scoreline , @entity77 5 @entity78 so far 4 — was to feel the warm embrace of collective @entity84			1
no outsider would have known what the hell they were on about			0
great voice : @entity6 's inflection meant you knew exactly how your team had done i know some people whose fascination with football was ignited by @entity19 reading the results , and even one who , as a six - year - old , chose his team — @entity99 , although he grew up in @entity100 — purely because he liked the sombre , authoritative way it rolled off @entity6 ’s tongue			1
it is immeasurably sad that , at the age of 77 , @entity19 is being forced into retirement by throat cancer , which has required the removal of his larynx			1
but his status as a @entity114 institution is assured , so much so that i once heard his name ventured as the answer to the quiz question : who invented the telephone ? saturdays will never be the same again .			0

@entity50 predict that the 77 - year - old relaid between 50 - *60,000* results during his four decades at the @entity125
