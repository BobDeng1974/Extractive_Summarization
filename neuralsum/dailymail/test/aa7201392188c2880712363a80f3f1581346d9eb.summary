if the team with momentum hold an ace card heading into the play - offs , then watch out for @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s team moved into sixth place in the @entity8 with a fourth successive victory after @entity10 , the substitute , headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game			1
pre-match results had offered @entity4 a prospective route into the play - off zone , with @entity17 and @entity18 dropping points unexpectedly , and @entity6 reflected the burgeoning confidence within @entity21 by naming an unchanged starting line - up from the side that prevailed 2 - 1 at @entity24 on friday for a third successive victory			1
@entity4 substitute @entity10 races away in celebration after scoring a late winner @entity10 is congratulated by his @entity4 team - mates following his 88th - minute winner against @entity32 @entity4 striker @entity33 slides on his knees after scoring his side 's third goal of the afternoon @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ; @entity42 ( @entity43 78mins ) , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity10 70 ) subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 booked : @entity41 , @entity39 goals : @entity48 19 , 45 , @entity33 48 , @entity10 88 @entity32 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ; @entity66 ( @entity67 82 ) subs not used : @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity74 , @entity62 , @entity58 goal : @entity65 , @entity76 65 , @entity64 74 referee : @entity78 attendance : 25,169 with a day less to recover , @entity32 had also been on a decent run before saturday ’s 3 - 0 home defeat by @entity82 topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history			1
@entity85 , the head coach , had said he would consider his future after this game at @entity4 after his assistant @entity88 had been suspended without explanation			0
although @entity91 , @entity32 ’ banned owner , has subsequently claimed @entity93 had used abusive language towards sporting director @entity95 , it was only another spanner in the works for this once - proud club who need stability more than anything			2
still , it was @entity32 who struck the first blow , courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from @entity44 who , penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant @entity63 , attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off @entity40 , his own team - mate , for @entity111 to sidefoot under @entity37			1
even before the january arrival of @entity33 , now level with @entity113 as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions , @entity4 have happily relied on either and both of the @entity117 combination of @entity46 and @entity48			0
it was the latter who earned @entity6 ’s team the lead by half - time			0
@entity48 equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from @entity47 , all loping legs and dizzying stepovers , eluded @entity56			0
it still needed a cute finish as the former @entity130 striker lifted his shot over @entity57 from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season			0
@entity64 looks delighted after putting @entity32 back on level terms by scoring his side 's third goal @entity4 goalkeeper @entity37 dives in vain as @entity64 makes it 3 - 3 before @entity10 ' late winner @entity32 attempted to disrupt @entity4 ’ rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling , @entity63 receiving one caution for fouling @entity44 then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former @entity148 midfielder ’s sock			1
the home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half - time approached however and , in stoppage time , @entity32 conceded at what appeared to be the worst time			1
their defence appeared to disappear as @entity46 played in @entity48 who took his time before firing in off the near post			0
wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as @entity33 joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart			0
the former @entity167 striker , who scored 19 times on loan for @entity170 in the first half of the season , attempted an audacious overhead kick from @entity45 ’s cross into the area			0
@entity46 kept play alive , dropping the ball back for @entity39 , whose shot hit @entity48 but fell back for @entity178 to smash in his tenth goal for @entity4			1
@entity32 looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before @entity4 offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute			1
@entity64 ’s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of ‘ leave it ’ could be heard from the press box , presumably from @entity37 , only for @entity39 to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper			0
@entity40 was the next guilty party in the @entity4 defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to @entity64 who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner			0
wolves do possess strength in depth however and in @entity10 they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals			2
so it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head @entity44 ’s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took @entity4 into sixth place			2
@entity32 celebrate after @entity111 puts @entity85 's side in the lead during the @entity21 clash			2

@entity10 scored in the 88th minute to give his side the win
wolves raced into 3 - 1 lead before @entity32 pulled back two - goal *deficit*
however @entity10 scored late on to ensure @entity4 moved up to sixth
