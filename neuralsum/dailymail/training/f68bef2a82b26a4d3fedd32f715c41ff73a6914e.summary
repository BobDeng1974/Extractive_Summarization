by @entity0 a boy was left almost completely blind for the first five years of his life after bungling @entity4 staff failed to notice there was anything wrong with him - despite the fact he could n’t see his bottle as a baby			1
@entity11 , now 12 , suffered from a deteriorating eye - condition that ' robbed him of his childhood ' after it went undiagnosed for five years			1
health workers that visited concerned parents @entity16 , 43 , and @entity18 , 44 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , were too busy to properly diagnose the youngster and repeatedly told them to ' stop being silly '			2
@entity23 victory : @entity11 , 12 , and his father @entity24			1
the boy has received a payout after he was left almost blind by @entity4 staff who failed to diagnose his eye condition @entity11 ( right ) with his brother @entity29 at @entity30 in 2007			1
@entity11 did n't look at the camera in any of the 200 pictures			1
he simply did n't know where it was this was despite @entity11 seemingly being unable to see his milk bottle right next to him and as he grew older needed to sit one inch away from the tv to see it			1
he would also sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around and barely moved when left alone			0
but alarm bells really started to ring for the couple when they returned from a trip to @entity30 in 2005 and looked at their holiday pictures they noticed that despite posing for over 200 photos - @entity11 had n’t looked at the camera in any of them			1
they then took him to an optician who diagnosed @entity11 with a deteriorating sight condition called hypermetropica amblyopia which had left him barely able to see			1
@entity11 would sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around			1
he barely moved when left alone because of his poor vision after being fixed with a pair of life - changing glasses which considerably improved his vision @entity11 is thriving seven years on			1
now @entity18 and @entity16 have been handed an undisclosed payout from @entity61 after they admitted liability for a ' breach of duty '			0
the money will fund future occupational therapy , optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for @entity11			1
@entity11 and his father in 2004			1
@entity72 used to cry for a bottle when it was in front of him when he was very young today mr @entity11 , a full - time carer for his son , told how they brought bigger and bigger tvs in an attempt to stop his son sitting so close to the screen			1
he said : ' the health worker came to see him , she was rushed off her feet , she was trying to do the job of 55 people			0
' so she missed it , she did n’t have time to properly look at @entity11			1
we were always told there was nothing wrong , or we were being silly			0
' i met her five years later and that report she wrote about him was still in the bottom of her briefcase , she just had been so rushed it got forgotten			2
' it was n’t until after we returned from a family holiday to @entity30 and we looked through our photographs , that we noticed that @entity11 was n’t looking at the camera in any of the photos			1
' when we asked him why he did n’t turn to look at the camera he said that he simply did n’t see where it was			2
' he was sitting barely an inch from the screen of the tv , there was no way he could see anything			0
' we were gradually buying bigger and bigger tvs to try and get him to sit further back , to the point we still have a 55 inch one			0
' this all set alarms bells ringing and we immediately took him to the opticians for an examination			0
' when we spoke to the optician about his results , the tests revealed his sight was very poor to the point where he could barely see anything at all			0
' we were devastated and could not believe he had gone through so many years of his young life not being able to see properly			2
we just trusted the health workers like you do			0
' when the optician put on that metal pair of glasses they do that they change the lenses in and he got to the point @entity11 could see , he refused to take them off			1
' we had to wait for two hours while they made up our prescription with @entity11 wearing those glasses as he was so amazed			1
' when we left he saw a pigeon for the first time , and he did n’t know what it was			0
he told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen			0
' i realised then he had never seen anything , i had to tell him what a leaf was			1
' his father said : ' ( after visiting the optician ) he saw a pigeon for the first time , and he didn ¿ t know what it was			0
he told me it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen ' he added : ' despite his delay at the start he is now top of his class , he loves reading and doing many things normal boys do			0
' i am just so sad he lost those first few years of his life for no reason			0
i want people to know that the @entity4 should treat all children with respect			0
' i asked @entity11 why he never told me about his sight , and he just said he thought that ’s how they were meant to be			2
' the payout will help with paying for the glasses and physiotherapy but really this is about the fact that we were right all along about our son			0
' however , we hope improvements are made in training and resource to help medical staff recognise the symptoms of hypermetropica amblyopia and refer other patients for the appropriate tests and treatment			0
' fun : @entity11 can now play video games on the sofa with his brothers			2
right , @entity11 his brother @entity29 at his cousin 's wedding in @entity186 in august 2013 thanks to his glasses @entity11 can now read , write and spend his free time playing his favourite game @entity190 on his @entity191			2
he said : ' i can play my favourite games on my xbox now			0
' the glasses have changed my life completely , i did n’t understand what seeing was , i just thought it was how it was meant to be			0
' now i love playing @entity190 and i can do that from the sofa with my brothers			0
' @entity202 , a lawyer at @entity203 , who represented the family , said : ' @entity11 ’s family has been left devastated because his early childhood was severely hampered by the delay to diagnose and treat him , despite the family raising their concerns repeatedly with health professionals			2
' @entity11 requires a lot of intensive treatment to help assist his development			1
the settlement will provide @entity11 with vital funding to assist with his treatment and provide future financial support			1
' we hope that lessons are learned by the @entity61 from @entity11 ’s case and that all staff are adequately trained to ensure that children are given the appropriate tests to identify and treat health issues as quickly as possible			2
' the money will fund future occupational therapy , optical and physiotherapy costs and will be used to pay for extra tuition for @entity11			2
