by @entity0 , political reporter published : 20:54 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 21:02 est , 28 december 2012 @entity1 : ' it gave me financial independence ' school leavers are to be urged to go straight into professional jobs as apprentices without getting a university degree			1
oxbridge - educated skills minister @entity9 has announced schemes to throw open the doors of the professions to non-graduates so that teenagers can train as lawyers , accountants and insurance brokers			1
he said youngsters who go straight from a-levels into training for high - flying @entity22 careers , can immediately receive a salary and many see a faster rise up the career ladder than graduates			1
mr @entity9 , who holds degrees from both @entity28 and @entity29 universities , and worked as a @entity32 economist before entering politics , said that if he was leaving school today and had the option of an apprenticeship ' i would have considered it '			1
auditors and accountants can now train straight from school at the professional services giant @entity41 , while a law course for school leavers being designed with @entity44 , a chain of law schools in eight @entity47 cities , is set to begin in september			1
a scheme for insurance professionals is already up and running which allows them to qualify in three years – a year ahead of their peers who do a three - year degree and then must do a year of on - the - job training afterwards			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the idea is it will allow more people to think , at the age of 18 , if i want to be a lawyer or an accountant i do n't have to go to university to do it			1
' instead of three years of an undergraduate degree and a couple of years afterwards , you can qualify as a lawyer quicker and get paid for doing it			0
' ' we have started with these three professions but i see this as very much demand - driven and if any other professions come forward i 'm all ears			2
these apprenticeships reflect the economy how it is now , not how it was 20 years ago			0
' however , professor @entity76 , director of the government 's @entity77 , said intelligent , motivated students would be best off going to university			1
academic study , he told the @entity84 's @entity83 programme , would broaden their horizons , hone their writing and debating skills and give them a professional network for life			2
' we are trying our best to remove barriers , ' he said			0
' if you have the potential , you should look to university			0
it 's the best career move you can make , and nobody regrets education			0
' some professionals such as solicitors used to be able to do all their training on the job without taking a degree , although they still had to obtain professional qualifications			0
but such apprenticeship - style training was phased out several decades ago			2
around 500,000 young people a year become apprentices in careers such as engineering and construction			2
@entity47 's biggest firms such as @entity113 and @entity114 have large apprenticeship schemes			0
but mr @entity9 said the aim was to broaden it out to white collar careers , with a £ 25million fund for professional apprenticeships set up by the @entity121			1
' i have nothing negative to say about university , you learn an awful lot there , but this gives 18 - year - olds more options , and that 's especially important to ensure everyone who is bright has a chance to access the professions , ' he said			1
' it 's a paid job – that 's an important principle			0
apprenticeships not only mean people are paid while they are learning but they learn faster and learn very practical skills for that job , which raises morale for the apprentice and everyone in the workplace			2
' opportunities : mr @entity9 said a university education ' is not for everyone ' but that all youngsters should have the chance to aim for ' valuable jobs ' in areas such as a law , financial services and engineering he said social mobility was the main aim of the scheme , but that apprentices could also be a good ' export market ' as @entity47 has a strong professional services sector whose employees are sought after in emerging markets such as @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			1
from next year firms including @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 are planning schemes			0
@entity171 , chief operating officer at the @entity172 , which delivers the schemes , said that in the past year increasing numbers of high - achieving school leavers have given up university places for on the job training			1
' i recently visited apprentices at @entity114 , one of whom gave up a place at @entity28 to study maths , ' she said			0
' another girl we had works for @entity113			0
she got great a-level grades and was destined for university but decided not to go			0
' apprenticeships are no longer just for crafts and with the cost involved in going to university , and the attraction of being employed and earning money from the beginning , it is a serious contender for some young people			2
