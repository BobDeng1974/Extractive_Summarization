for most people , playing racing video games is as close as they will get to being a racing driver			2
but for @entity4 , this was n't enough			1
the 19 - year - old from @entity6 was one of thousands of wannabe racers who took part in a unique competition on the @entity12 video game that can transform gamers into professional race drivers			1
let the fastest time win			2
dream come true : @entity4 is still shocked at just how much has happened over the past 12 months ' i entered @entity15 as the prize at stake was incredible , ' said @entity4			1
' it was always a dream to become a racing driver , but i never thought it would be possible as motorsport can be so expensive			2
' i knew thousands of people would be entering , so i did not think at the start i would win			0
i knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up , so i thought it was worth giving it my best shot			0
' then began @entity4 's gruelling regime , every day trying to shave off milliseconds from his time in the hope of making the @entity35			1
having dropped out of university to reassess his career options , he had time on his side but as he soon found out , this made things no easier			0
' i basically locked myself in my room for two weeks , ' he said			0
' i would have breakfast , and then i would focus everything on the time trial			0
after a quick break for lunch , i would be straight back on it to around four o’clock			0
' it was tough , but i really wanted to make the @entity35			0
there were times when my parents were on at me for spending so much time playing the game and some of my friends were travelling around @entity55 during a gap year , but i knew what i want to do			1
become a professional racing driver ! ' little by little , @entity4 would see his lap times improve , only for another equally keen gamer to better him			1
religiously checking the leader boards , @entity4 carried on undeterred until finally , nearly 1000 time trials later , his persistence paid off			1
doing it for real : @entity4 says the skills learned through playing the game served him well on the track ' i was thrilled , as just to qualify for the online time trials i must have done nearly 1,000 laps ! ' he said			1
' when i did my best lap i was exiting the final corner with one hand on the steering wheel and the other fist - pumping the air because i knew that was the lap where i could n’t go any faster , that was my limit			1
' then i watched the timing screens for the rest of the night and woke up in the morning to find out that i ’d qualified and it was amazing			0
i was jumping for joy and telling my family , who were as excited as me			0
it was a fantastic moment			0
' from then on , @entity4 's life changed			1
he went on to win the @entity35 and earn a place on the @entity85			0
gone was the playstation controller and safety of his bedroom			0
these were real cars with real , potentially fatal , consequences			0
thankfully , @entity4 was able to transfer some of his gaming skills on to the track			1
' i first drove the @entity94 at @entity85 , on slick tyres , ' he said			0
' the noise was just incredible , the gearbox was amazing and the brakes were so stiff – it was a car ! ' i was definitely able to take some skills from the game into real life			2
i ’d never had a car sideways before and i was suddenly doing it in real life , just from doing it on the game ! ' before long , @entity4 was racing in @entity105 24 hours - a legendary endurance race that would push his skills to the limit			1
and even though he did n't make the podium , the entire experience was a moment @entity4 would treasure for a lifetime			2
on course for success : the teenager has been tipped for great things in the racing world ' to be able to race at @entity105 last month racing against drivers i watched on tv was an incredible feeling ! ' he said			1
' the @entity120 , the @entity121 … it was all as good as everyone said it would be			0
racing at @entity105 was everything i expected and more			2
when you are on the track , on your own , with new tyres and low - ish fuel , it ’s incredible			2
' as the latest crop of @entity15 drivers from the @entity12 6 demo converge for the final at @entity133 on august 13 - only one thing will be on their minds : ' i wonder where i 'll be this time next year ... ' let us know what you think on @entity141 : @ @entity142 and on @entity143 : @entity144 .			1

@entity4 won the @entity15 - a competition that turns keen @entity12 players into professional racers
spent hours and hours *honing* his skills - *stretching* his *determination* and relationships to the limit
raced in @entity105 this year and held his own against drivers who have been in the sport for ten times as long
