by @entity0 a pair of smart glasses that could transform the lives of blind and partially - sighted people could be in the shops as soon as 2016			1
the revolutionary technology enables those suffering from sight loss to see obstacles and faces , similar to the fictional high - tech visor worn by @entity11 in tv 's @entity12			1
the smart glasses consist of a video camera mounted on the frame of the glasses ; a computer processing unit that is small enough to fit in a pocket ; and software that provides images of objects close - by to the see - through displays in the eyepieces of the glasses			1
the joint project between the @entity26 and the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) has won a £ 500,000 grant in a @entity30 charity competition			1
he said that the glasses add extra information and detail to what he sees and that everyone has ' drawings around them '			1
a version of what he sees is pictured on the laptop ( left ) the money will enable @entity27 and @entity26 to create 100 pairs of smart glasses and test them with 1,000 people			1
this will be the first large - scale test of smart glasses and augmented reality for sight enhancement anywhere in the world and is the first step towards getting the glasses made available to everyone who needs them - for as little as £ 300			1
there are 300,000 people registered as blind in the @entity63 who still have some remaining vision and it si estimated the glasses could help half of them			1
the smart glasses enable those with very limited vision to make use of what sight remains , increasing their confidence and helping them navigate and communicate with people			1
the prototype has already enabled users to identify faces and obstacles more clearly than they have seen for years			2
dr @entity80 of @entity26 is pictured wearing the innovation			0
right , the @entity12 character @entity11 within 18 months , @entity27 hopes to be able to revolutionise the lives of 1,000 people living with sight loss , providing the foundations to create a low - cost version with additional functionality for people with sight loss around the world			2
‘ the idea of the smart glasses is to give people with poor vision an aid that boosts their awareness of what ’s around them – allowing greater freedom , independence and confidence to get about , and a much improved quality of life , ’ says dr @entity80 of the @entity92 of @entity93 at the @entity26 , who is leading the development of the glasses			2
' the group has been awarded further funding from the @entity110 to look at introducing more features into the glasses , such as face , object or text recognition			2
an audio prompt via an earphone would give people more information about who or what they are seeing			0
‘ we eventually want to have a product that will look like a regular pair of glasses and cost no more than a few hundred pounds - about the same as a smart phone , ’ says dr @entity80			1
the idea of the smart glasses ( pictured ) is to give people with poor vision - who are severely sight impaired but can see a small amount - an aid that boosts their awareness of what 's around them @entity32 , a copywriter for a marketing agency in @entity133 , tried out the smart glasses in @entity34 ’s @entity33			1
the 43 - year - old was diagnosed with the inherited eye condition choroideremia at around the age of 12			2
he has an area of central vision left in each eye			0
he can still work in front of a computer and carry on writing , but started using a cane around three years ago – mostly as a sign to others that moving around can be more of a problem			0
on having the glasses fitted outside a café in the @entity33 , @entity32 reacted : ‘ i can see your face			2
' it ’s like the @entity151 when he puts the ring on and sees things in a new way			0
the smart glasses consist of a video camera mounted on the frame of the glasses , a computer processing unit that is small enough to fit in a pocket and software that provides images of objects close - by to the see - through displays in the eyepieces of the glasses			1
the transparent electronic displays , where the glasses ’ lenses would be , give a simple image of nearby people and obstacles			2
the camera with specially designed software interprets the nearby surroundings allowing people to see important things much more distinctly than before , such as kerbs , tables and chairs , or groups of people			0
the glasses do n’t replace lost vision , but assist with spatial awareness			0
anyone using the glasses looks through them to make the most of their existing sight , with additional images appearing in their line of sight to give extra information about who or what is in front of them			1
' that tablecloth is looking lovely			0
it ’s getting the pattern of the tablecloth			0
' it ’s like i ’ve wandered into an 80s pop video			0
everyone has cool @entity208 drawings round them			0
it ’s now much more of a scene with several people in			0
’ the @entity213 is run by the technology giant and asks @entity63 - based charities how they would change the world through innovative technology			1
@entity219 , executive director of the charity 's innovation lab and another judge in the @entity213 , said : ' this challenge shines a light on just how many charities are already doing great things with technology to address some of our most pressing challenges , ' she said			0

technology uses glasses - mounted camera to project images onto eyepieces
it means those who are *legally* blind can see faces and objects
the state - of - the - art glasses could help *150,000* in the @entity63 alone
