by @entity0 @entity1 , 20 questions , @entity3 , reading books and taking naps			2
that 's how employees at an @entity10 processing plant spend their days , a former employee says			1
@entity11 , 42 , says she quit her job at @entity10 contractor @entity14 's office in @entity15 , @entity16 , just outside @entity17 in april because she could n't handle ' doing nothing ' all day anymore			1
' you could be completely sane and work there for seven months and leave there and almost want to check yourself into a mental hospital			0
it was that bad , ' @entity11 told @entity17 ' news 4 @entity25			2
' bring lots of pencils : a former employee at an @entity10 processing center recalls having so little work to do that she played board games like @entity1 and @entity3 all day this week @entity25 ran a scathing report on alleged waste and abuse of taxpayer funds at @entity14 's office featuring an unidentified whistle blower who said employees do nothing for days or weeks at a time			1
the employee alleged that @entity14 was keeping its workforce unnecessarily high to get more money out of the federal government			2
' they want to hire more people , even though we still do n't have work to keep the people that we have busy , ' the employee said			2

' there a weeks that a data entry person would not process an application , ' the employee said			2
' they 're told to sit at their computers and hit the refresh button every 10 minutes - no more than every 10 minutes			0
they 're monitored - to hopefully look for an application			0
' with paper applications on the decline after @entity31 began working more frequently , the employee said data entry personnel were only expected to enter two applications a month , ' and some people are not even able to do that			2
' after it began looking into the initial whistle blower 's claims , @entity25 found even more current and former @entity14 employees who were willing to attest that the company is wasting government resources , including @entity11			1
' i think for the entire month of december , i processed six applications , ' @entity11 said			0
' and that was actually pretty good , correct ? ' @entity25 reporter @entity107 asked her			0
' that was pretty good , ' she confirmed			0
another employee who wished to remain anonymous told @entity25 that her supervisor told her department that if they processed two applications a month , their job was done			2
so bored were employees , @entity14 gave them books to read , @entity11 said			1
' we played @entity1 on a very large dry erase board , ' she said			0

we all referred to it as our cell blocks , ' she told the @entity127			0

' i feel guilty for working there as long as i did , ' she told the ' it was like i was stealing money from people			0
' the employee who originally contacted @entity25 alleged that @entity14 is n't firing employees it does n't need because the more people it has working on the project , the more money it gets from the government			1
' so they want us there , even if we 're not doing anything			0
' @entity16 senator @entity164 says an employee of the @entity166 , a subcontractor for @entity14 , told her office that when @entity169 came to visit their facility , they were instructed to ' sit at their desks and pretend to work even though they had no work to do			1
@entity164 sent a letter to the @entity69 inspector general asking him to ' evaluate these claims and , if warranted , undertake a thorough investigation			0
' ' if it 's anything like what the whistle - blowers suggest , it 's terrible , ' @entity16 senator @entity179 told @entity184 on wednesday			1
' if it 's exactly what the whistleblowers suggest , it 's an absolute outrage for every taxpayer in @entity189			0
' rep. @entity194 , whose congressional district encompasses the area where the @entity10 contractor 's office is located , ' is talking with all relevant committees of jurisdiction to discuss whether or not an investigation is warranted , ' a spokesman said			1

only certain groups of people such as young people aging off their parents ' health insurance can enroll for @entity10 at this time			2

the government expects repairs to healthcare.gov to be finished by that time , which will likely reduce the frequency of paper applications even further			2
@entity14 has been declining to comment for the story			0
the @entity226 and @entity228 - @entity69 agency overseeing the federal health exchanges - told @entity25 that , ' @entity14 is committed to making sure federal funds are spent appropriately , and the number of @entity14 staff is reviewed on a regular basis , ' @entity25 says			1
