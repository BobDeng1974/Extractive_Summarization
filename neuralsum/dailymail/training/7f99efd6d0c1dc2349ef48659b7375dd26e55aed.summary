by @entity0 a @entity2 footballer who changed his citizenship to @entity4 so he could play for the country 's national football team is now regretting it – after he was called up to fight in the army			1
@entity9 , 34 , admitted that he had never considered the possibility that the passport change would mean he 'd have to swap the football field for the battlefield			2
@entity4 had compulsory military service for school - leavers but @entity9 was too old when he got his citizenship to have to worry about performing it , and in any case the country announced in 2012 that it was scrapping compulsory military service in 2013			1
acting president @entity35 issued the decree saying @entity4 will conduct a draft for active military service in the @entity39 in order to increase the state defence potential			2
the decree says : ‘ @entity4 male citizens who are physically qualified for military service , over 18 - years - old and older and who have no right for exemption from military service will be conscripted			2
’ it added that the measures were to address the deteriorating situation in the east and south of @entity4 , activities of illegally formed armed pro-russian groups , the seizure and blockade of the state administration buildings , military administration facilities , military bases and so on which pose a threat to @entity4 's territorial integrity			2
game on : @entity9 in action on the football field - he 's now been called up to fight on the battle field but that has left the footballer , who married @entity4 @entity22 in 2008 , with orders to report for duty and he admits : ‘ i had n't reckoned on this and although i 'm a bit nervous that it might not get sorted out , i have to say that my wife is terrified			1
i have told her not to worry though and everything will be fine			0
‘ to be honest , i don ‘ t know what i would do if i actually went into the army			0
playing football is the only thing i can do			0
i haven ‘ t heard that any of my team mates have been called up , but maybe nobody says it out loud			0
’ for the last three years the midfielder has played for @entity4 side @entity87 and he said the order to turn up for duty had been a complete surprise			1
conflict : the @entity93 government is embroiled in a military struggle with @entity96 separatists in eastern @entity4			0

the club told me they will try to resolve the issue for me			0
’ the @entity2 came to the @entity4 in 2000 when he signed a contract with @entity106			1
he played at the club for five years before moving to @entity87 , where he remains today , and after getting a @entity4 passport he also played for the national side where he was capped 11 times , scoring a single goal			1
the games he played in included one against @entity114 in @entity93 in 2013 in which the @entity4 won 1 - 0			0
@entity9 , unlike many fellow @entity115 , remained in the @entity4 despite the political crisis			1
