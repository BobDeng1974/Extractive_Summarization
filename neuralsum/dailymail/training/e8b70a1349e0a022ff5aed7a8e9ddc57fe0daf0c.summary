by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 15 january 2013 barely half of all police officers would report a colleague for administering a punishment beating on a suspect , according to a study which concluded there is a ‘ blue wall of silence ’ in policing			1
a study into police ethics by the @entity13 found just 54 per cent of officers would ‘ definitely ’ tell on a fellow officer who punched a suspect for trying to escape			1
its author , dr @entity17 , senior lecturer in criminology at the @entity13 , said the findings show there was a ‘ blue wall of silence ’ which ‘ still exists ’ within the police			2
' blue wall of silence ' : a study into police ethics by the @entity13 found just 54 per cent of officers would ' definitely ' tell on a fellow officer who punched a suspect for trying to escape she told a conference on police standards that ‘ the study found officers were unlikely to report officers even in cases they thought were serious '			1
nearly one in five officers said they would definitely not report a colleague who ran a private security business in breach of the rules			0
around 17 per cent would definitely not report someone who ‘ accepted unsolicited gifts on duty ’			0
one in four officers would definitely not report an officer who accepted food and alcohol on occasions such as @entity51			0
on the violent attack , officer were told a colleague ‘ punched a suspect a couple of times as a punishment for fleeing and resisting ’			0
around 10 per cent said they would definitely or maybe not report the incident , while 21 per cent said they said they possibly would report it , while 13 per cent did not say either way			0
the survey collated responses from 520 police officers at three unnamed forces			1
dr @entity17 said the study also found that overall officers were ‘ uncertain ’ about what was against the rules and what was allowed			2
' unacceptable ' : @entity76 chairman @entity75 ( right ) found the research by dr @entity17 ( left ) startling and said it shows the blurred line between right and wrong			1
she said the ' blue wall of silence ' ' still exists ' in the police force @entity17 , senior lecturer in criminology at the @entity13 she said : ‘ the findings of the study reveal that officers seem uncertain of the rules and regulations covering their behaviour , especially at the lower end of the spectrum			1
‘ in other words , officers were not clear about the bending of rules covering minor offences such as working in their spare time or accepting free drinks or small gifts			0
’ more experienced officers were more likely to report a colleague than younger officers			0
@entity76 chairman @entity75 said : ‘ we all expect our police officers to uphold the highest standards of integrity , but this startling research shows how , for many , the line between right and wrong is indeed blurred			1
‘ it is also apparent that for some officers , the sense of proportion has gone wrong			2
use of inappropriate force and cover ups are completely unacceptable for officers of the law			0
‘ the police service is undergoing significant reform , with the new @entity121 and a tough new chief inspector of constabulary it must take this opportunity to make sure that our expectations for officers ’ conduct are clearly established and upheld			2
