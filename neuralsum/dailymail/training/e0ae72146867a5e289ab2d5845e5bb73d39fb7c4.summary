@entity0 is n't an @entity2 fighter in @entity3			1
he 's never been to @entity3			1
and the plumber from @entity5 , @entity6 , says he certainly would never willingly aid fundamentalist rebels			1
so it 's hard for him to understand how his @entity10 pickup truck - including his logo for @entity12 and his phone number - wound up being in a photo posted on @entity15 by the extremist @entity16 from the front lines of the war in @entity3			1
mr @entity0 says he 's been getting hundreds of phone calls and faxes since the @entity16 tweeted a picture of what appeared to be his old truck with an anti-aircraft gun in the back , according to the @entity26			1
however , it remains to be seen if the photo is entirely authentic , with a new video surfacing which suggests the photo could have been digitally altered			2
it 's unclear if it has gone all the way to @entity3 or whether the photo has been digitally altered this photo , taken from a propaganda video , shows a near identical scene featuring a different truck , raising questions as to the authenticity of the photo featuring mr @entity0 's truck the @entity34 forces fighting across the region are known for their advanced and technical digital propaganda campaigns			1
the video , featuring a different vehicle firing from exactly the same position , raises the possibility mr @entity0 's vehicle may have been photoshopped into a video frame			1
superimposing a better vehicle and gun into a still frame from the original video would be significantly easier than trying to alter the video itself			1
this could be why the video features an older model car and weapon , but the photo features mr @entity0 's later - model @entity67			1
despite this , people have now been making hateful phone calls to mr @entity0 's company in the mistaken belief he is supporting the fundamentalists			1
' a few of the people are really ugly , ' he told the newspaper			0
mr @entity0 says he has hired a lawyer and wants to make @entity15 remove the posting , @entity78 reports			2
he says he sold the truck to an @entity83 dealership three years ago			1
in the past when he sold his work trucks , he always removed the logo first			2
the last time he got rid of a vehicle he did n't			2
@entity0 says he has no idea how @entity2 in @entity3 could have got hold of his truck mr @entity0 , who has worked as a plumber for the past 32 - years , assumed @entity83 would remove the decal before selling the truck			1
it 's still unknown how the truck could have made its way into the possession of @entity34 fighters in @entity3			1
a spokesman for @entity83 told @entity101 that the truck went to auction , and probably different owners over and over , before it may have ended up in the hands of @entity2 terrorists			0
@entity0 wants the death threats and the phone to stop ringing			1
' we have a secretary here , she 's scared to death			2
we do n't want no problems , ' said @entity0			2
@entity78 reports that the band of @entity16 seen in the photo mostly hail from @entity117 in @entity118			1
while most fighters are @entity2 extremists , the group has not reportedly allied itself with @entity121 in @entity3			1
@entity121 : the terror group has expanded how and why it recruits new members and is specifically targeting sympathizers abroad and while it is not known how fighters with @entity121 could have come to own a @entity6 plumber 's truck , the terror group is trying to expand how it recruits fighters to its ranks			1
the extremist organization also has been targeting its sophisticated propaganda to entice potential wives and professionals such as doctors , accountants and engineers in its efforts to build a new society			0
among those it has lured were three teenage girls from @entity146 , who set out for @entity3 this fall after swapping @entity15 messages about marriage and religion with @entity151 recruiters , and a young woman who sought to fight there - or failing that , to use her nursing skills			1
it 's a diverse pool of recruits whose motives perplex @entity160 governments seeking to combat the flow			0
the group ' is issuing a bit of a siren song through social media , trying to attract people to their so - called caliphate , ' fbi director @entity162 told reporters			2
' and among the people they 're trying to attract are young women to be brides for these jihadis			0
' the group conscripts children for battle , recruits westerners for acts of jihad and releases videotapes of beheadings			0
but it also uses propaganda with a humanitarian appeal , such as photos of bombed - out @entity3 villages coupled with pleas for help			1
video images of smiling children being given treats and enjoying stuffed animals paint a family - friendly portrait that suggests roles within the proto - state for wives and mothers			2
@entity199 officials say people aiding the @entity201 understand what they 're getting into and risk prosecution , whether or not they venture to @entity3 and even if they do n't plan to take up arms themselves			2
prosecutors have criminally charged more than 15 people in connection with supporting @entity2 militant groups			0
advance : militant @entity34 fighters wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of @entity3 's northern @entity216 province in june a @entity218 , @entity219 , food store owner stands accused of trying to arrange for others to travel to @entity3 and of plotting to kill members of the @entity223 military			1
an @entity225 man , allegedly determined to join militants , left behind a letter saying he was disgusted by western society			0
and prosecutors say a @entity231 man asked @entity232 online for martyrdom			0
most charges are brought under a statute that makes it illegal to provide ' material support ' - including money , training or a false identity - to a designated terrorist group			2
defense lawyers argued the law is overly broad and ensnares the misguided as often as it sweeps up the dangerous			0
courts , however , have accepted an expansive interpretation of the law			0
' we need to make clear that if you want to go over there and join a terrorist group , you 're likely to end up instead in jail , ' @entity248 said			0
@entity199 officials say they 're also trying strategies other than prosecution , including trying to identify potential recruits before they go			0
@entity259 agents in @entity146 met repeatedly with @entity260 , a 19 - year - old nurse 's aide who had converted to @entity2 , hoping to dissuade her from traveling to @entity3 to marry a militant suitor she met online			1
agents suggested she try humanitarian work instead of jihad , but she told them that if she could n't fight , she would use her skills as a nurse 's aide to help militant fighters , according to court documents			0
@entity273 pleaded guilty in september and faces sentencing next month			0
her lawyer , @entity274 , has said she was ' led terribly astray ' while pursuing her religion and was ' saved ' by her arrest			0
perhaps no case better shows the penetration of the recruitment campaign than that of the three @entity146 girls , all from @entity283 immigrant families , who were radicalized online and headed for @entity3 in october			2
the self - styled ' caliphate ' declared by the @entity201 group bridging @entity286 and @entity3 is starting to show signs of strain a review of the girls ' social media use , which included thousands of @entity15 messages and postings on other sites , by the @entity295 shows they were in contact with online jihadists from around the world and were deeply interested in marriage and the role of women			1
as recruiters interacted with the girls , their typical teenage banter about friends and school became replaced with discussions of religion , paradise and death , the review showed			0
six months before they went overseas , one girl wrote that she wanted to get married as soon as possible and her friends wished her well , telling her they hoped she got an ' amazing husband because you do not deserve anything else ! ' one female recruiter told prospects to expect to marry quickly and expect to live a domestic life , as it is ' completely impossible for women to participate in battle , ' according to @entity295			0
women are expected to marry the fighters and bear their children , she explained			0
another recruiter told a 16 - year - old girl who inquired about joining that ' everyone is welcome , ' according to the report			0
@entity223 officials say even comparatively benign motives for supporting the @entity201 are troubling			0
' i 'm not sure we 've seen someone who 's gone over there who 's not attracted to the jihadi cause , ' @entity248 said .			0

@entity0 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , sold his truck to a dealership three years ago
the truck , featuring the name of his company - @entity342 - is seen in a propaganda photo released by @entity34 group @entity16
the vehicle has been *outfitted* with an anti-aircraft gun and is fighting on the front lines in @entity3
the logo features @entity0 's phone number and he says he 's now getting death threats
but a propaganda video shows a similar vehicle shooting from exactly the same position , raising questions about the photo 's authenticity
