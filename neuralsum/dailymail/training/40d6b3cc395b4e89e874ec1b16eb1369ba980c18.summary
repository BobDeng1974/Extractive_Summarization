the technology may still be in its infancy , but flexible screens are gradually being seen in more and more products			0
@entity4 and @entity5 have led the way , so far , but a number of other firms including @entity10 ’s @entity9 are also developing super-strong , flexible screens			1
at an exhibition in @entity13 , the firm demonstrated its latest breakthrough - a 5.9 - inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged			1
its display features organic light emitting diodes and measures 5.9 - inches the foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes ( @entity29 )			1
it features touch sensors , meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures , and was demonstrated at the @entity21 exhibition in @entity37			1
during the demonstration , the screen featured images of landscapes , cats and peacocks that bent and curved with the display			1
a number of the curved screens , including those created by @entity5 and @entity4 , use high molecular substance - based polyimide film			1
this forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic			0
the material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius , which in @entity59 's display is 0.7 - inches ( 2mm )			1
polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility			0
it was seen curving over the edge of a handset , similar to the screen on @entity4 ’s @entity68			1
@entity4 unveiled the @entity68 in september			2
because the display pops out of the phone , it can even be used when the cover is closed			0
the curved screen can also display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption			2
the curved screen can additionally display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption			2
the right - hand side of the edge , which is curved , is where notifications and other icons appear			2
it is the second phone released by the @entity86 firm that features curved display technology , following the @entity88 in october last year			1
@entity5 ’s @entity90 phone has a similar design , and both firms are pioneering curved @entity93			1
during tests , the display was bent more than 100,000 times and did n’t lose performance			1
it features touch sensors , meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures , and was demonstrated at the @entity21 exhibition in @entity37 during the demonstration , the screen featured images of landscapes , cats and peacocks ( pictured ) that bent and curved with the display			1
it was seen curving over the edge of a handset , similar to the screen on @entity4 ’s @entity68 in july , @entity5 unveiled an 18 - inch screen that can be rolled up , and it is hoping to expand the technology to work with 60 - inch displays in the future			1
this flexible oled panel has a high - definition class resolution of 1200 x 810 with almost 1 million megapixels			2
@entity123 is among the @entity125 companies developing similar flexible screen technology , and unveiled its own ‘ paper tablet ’ back in january 2013			0
it recently partnered with @entity128 ( @entity128 ) to build a transistor display featuring graphene			0
@entity4 unveiled the @entity68 ( pictured ) in september			2

the curved screen can also display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption in july , @entity5 unveiled an 18 - inch screen that can be rolled up , ( pictured ) and it is hoping to expand the technology to work with 60 - inch displays in the future			1
this flexible @entity29 panel has a high - definition class resolution of 1200 x 810 with almost one million megapixels graphene is made up of sheets of carbon atoms			2
it is among the strongest , most lightweight and flexible materials known and the development of the screen ' is a first step towards the wider implementation of graphene and graphene - like materials into flexible electronics ' , explained the firm			0
videos of the device show it being bent and stood on , as well as being cut with a pair of scissors without the images on the display being affected			0
the prototype is what 's known as an ' active matrix electrophoretic display '			0
it 's similar to the screens used in e-readers , but is made of flexible plastic instead of glass			0
in contrast to traditional displays , the pixel electronics , or backplane , of this display includes graphene electrodes			0
these electrodes replay metal electrodes in other devices			0
