government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced – but will come to an end earlier than planned , @entity1 figures revealed today			1
@entity5 said he needed to slash a further £ 30billion from government spending by 2017/18 , with £ 12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget			1
the government 's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '			1
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20			1
@entity5 's planned cuts will be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '			1
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade government spending as a percentage of gdp will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s , after mr @entity5 dropped plans to run a £ 23billion surplus in 2019/20 the @entity28 said the plans amounted to a ' rollercoaster ' of public spending			1
mr @entity5 's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt @entity35 's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s			1
but delivering his budget today , the chancellor said new plans would mean state spending as a share of national income the same size as @entity46 had in 2000 - when @entity35 was in office - but before , mr @entity5 said , ' spending got out of control '			0
the chancellor used his speech to trumpet official forecasts showing better economic growth			0
borrowing will also be £ 5billion less than expected over the next three years , he said			2
mr @entity5 said official predictions also saw the national debt starting to fall earlier than had previously been thought			0
national debt as a proportion of @entity23 will start to fall next year , not 2016/17 as previously thought			0
under @entity5 's plans , government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp to a level last seen in 2000 under @entity62 the government is still spending £ 90 billion more than it raises in taxes – and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19			1
for 2015/16 , the deficit will be cut to £ 75.3billion in 2015/16 and then £ 39.4billion the following year			0
in 2017/18 it will fall to £ 12.8billion before moving into a surplus of £ 5.2billion the year after			2
but in 2019/20 , the planned surplus will only rise to £ 7billion instead of the previously planned £ 23.1billion			2
meanwhile , debt as a proportion of @entity23 is expected to fall in the next fiscal year to 80.2 per cent			0
he said : ' this is a budget that takes @entity46 one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity			0
' because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the @entity83 , the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too			0
' in the final year of this decade , 2019 - 20 , public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy			2
we can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt			0

@entity63 will slash £ 30bn from government spending by 2017/18
planned cuts will be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '
but afterwards there will be the biggest spending increase for a decade
austerity had been *pencilled* in for four more years after *general* election
but the government will now end its cuts programme in 2018/19
@entity28 said it was a spending ' rollercoaster '
