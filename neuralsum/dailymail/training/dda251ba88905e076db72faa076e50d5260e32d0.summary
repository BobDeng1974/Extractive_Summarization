by @entity0 the @entity2 diocese of @entity3 , @entity4 says it was n't responsible for a teenage boy 's molestation because the priest was ' off duty ' at the time of the abuse			1
victim @entity11 claims reverend @entity12 , now 73 , sexually assaulted him hundreds of times over the course of a decade , starting when he was just 13 years old			1
now 42 , @entity15 is suing the diocese in @entity17 since other church leaders knew about the abuse and did nothing			1
abused : @entity11 ( left ) , now 42 , claims he was sexually assaulted hundreds of times by @entity22 ( right ) over more than 10 years			1
the assaults took place at church and even on trips out of @entity4 @entity15 previously lost a suit against the diocese in @entity29 , where some of the abuse allegedly took place			1
it was during that case that attorneys for the diocese used the controversial argument that they could n't be held responsible for @entity38 's actions , because abusing a child is not part of a priest 's ' duties '			1
@entity43 : @entity38 - aka father @entity44 - started abusing @entity15 at the age of 13			2
@entity15 ' mother let her son spend time alone with father @entity44 because she thought he was a good role model			2
above , a school picture of a young @entity15 ' how do we determine when a priest is and is not on duty ? ' one of the justices asked			1
' well , you can determine a priest is not on duty when he is molesting a child , for example , ' the diocese lawyer responded			2
' a priest abusing a child is absolutely contrary to the pursuit of his master 's business , to the work of a diocese			2
' @entity11 told the @entity69 that he was astounded by the church 's argument			2
' any hope i had that the church was concerned about me as a victim or about the conduct of its priests was totally gone , ' @entity11 said			2
' they were washing their hands of it			0
i just could nâ€™t believe that was one of their arguments			0
' @entity15 first came forward about the decade - long abuse in 2007 , when he had a breakdown and nearly committed suicide			1
instead , he came forward to the diocese with the heart - breaking tale of how @entity38 - aka ' father @entity44 ' - took advantage of him from a vulnerable age			0
@entity11 told the @entity69 that he first met father @entity44 in the mid- 1980s when the priest headed the youth group at @entity99 's parish in @entity100 , @entity4			1
father @entity44 promised to take @entity15 out for a ride on his boat during their first meeting at a weekend leadership retreat in 1985			0
his mother , a highly - religious single mom , agreed to let her young son accompany the priest - thinking father @entity44 was a great role model			0
@entity11 said nothing happened on that first trip out on father @entity44 's boat ' @entity114 ' , but that the outing was soon followed by an overnight trip on the @entity117 when the priest first molested him			1
he claims the priest went on to molest him hundreds of times for the next 10 years , at the youth group 's headquarters , the church rectory , father @entity44 's parents ' house , and on trips to @entity29 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and the @entity130			1
coming clean : father @entity44 and @entity15 ceased their sexual relationship in 1997 , and remained on good terms for another 10 years			0
but keeping their ' secret ' caused @entity15 to have a breakdown and he eventually told his wife and the diocese about the priest 's wrongdoings perhaps most damning for the diocese is that other leaders in the church knew about the abuse and did nothing			1
@entity11 the abuse went on until 1997 , when @entity15 was in his mid- 20s , and the two continued to remain on good terms			1
father @entity44 even introduced him to his current wife @entity147 , a school teacher			0
he presided over their wedding , baptized their two children and acted as godfather for one			0
@entity11 says it was father @entity44 's psychological control over him that kept him quiet for another 10 years			2
' he knew how to manipulate , ' @entity11 said			0
' he would say things like , " if your mother found out about this special thing we have , she would die , " ' @entity11 said			0
' he called it our little secret			0
and i thought i was the only one			0
' @entity11 finally told the diocese about father @entity44 in 2007 , after his wife confronted him for his distant behavior			1
aftermath : father @entity44 lost his position after @entity15 ' revelations			2
he was n't expelled from the priesthood however , and still receives his pension			1
pictured above opening his door for a @entity69 reporter			0
he refused to comment keeping the secret led @entity15 to become withdrawn and he even contemplated killing himself			0
mrs @entity15 says she could n't believe it at first , when her husband revealed he had been abused by the close family friend			1
but when he broke down in tears in front of her , she knew it was true			0
the diocese of @entity3 conducted their own investigation into @entity15 ' claims and promptly suspended @entity38 from the ministry			1
however , they did not remove him from the priesthood			0
@entity38 is still technically a priest and receiving his pension which he supplements with work as a real estate agent			2
after coming out about the abuse , @entity15 also realized he was n't the only one father @entity44 abused			1
@entity192 said in a 2011 press conference that the diocese paid him to be quiet about the abuse with a settlement in 1992			0
@entity198 , who claims he was abused by father @entity44 in the 1960s when he was working at his first assignment at @entity201 in @entity202 , received an undisclosed settlement two years ago , his attorney @entity197 said			2
however , @entity38 continues to deny he ever abused children			0
in a december 2012 deposition , he admitted to having an ' intense ' sexual relationship with @entity15 , but that it did n't start until the younger man was 18			1
accountability : @entity15 now lives in @entity210 , @entity4 with his wife and two children he says he 's suing the diocese not for the money , but to hold them accountable for not protecting children he also admitted to sleeping nude with a ' number of ' other teen boys in the youth group and that it was ' standard practice ' to bathe naked with the young men in his parent 's hot tub			1
@entity38 remained unapologetic when @entity15 confronted him in a taped phone call			0
' at no time did i feel like i was using your or taking advantage of you , ' @entity12 says on the tape , obtained by the @entity69			0
@entity15 won an individual judgement against @entity12 in @entity29 for $ 3million			1
he has n't received any of that sum yet and does n't believe he ever will since the priest has no assets			0
he maintains it 's not about the money though , but about exposing @entity12 's for ' the monster that he is			1
' @entity15 has now moved on to suing the diocese , which he believes could have done more to protect him and other vulnerable boys			1
' they knew about @entity12			0
they could have done something about it			0
and they did what every other diocese did			0
they kept it hush - hush and paid behind - the - scenes settlements , ' @entity11 said .			2

@entity11 claims he was sexually abused hundreds of times by @entity254 over the course of a decade starting when he was 13
now 42 , @entity15 is suing the diocese of @entity3 , @entity4 for knowing about @entity12 's abuse and doing nothing
however , the diocese argued they were n't responsible for his behavior since @entity12 was ' off duty ' as a priest when the sex *crimes* happened
@entity12 was suspended from his position in 2007 , when @entity15 first came forward about the molestation
two other men have admitted to being abused by @entity12 , and took undisclosed settlements from the diocese
@entity12 was never officially removed from the priesthood , so he 's technically still a priest and receives his retirement pension
