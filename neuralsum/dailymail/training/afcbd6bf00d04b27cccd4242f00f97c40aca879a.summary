by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 12:29 est , 15 august 2013 the walls are bare , the floors uncarpeted			0
there is a tin bath , and no central heating			1
it hardly looks like the house of a wealthy woman , but this is the first glimpse of the meagre council property is where @entity11 , the woman who left more than £ 500,000 to the government in her will , lived			1
the money was controversially accepted by both the @entity16 and @entity17 , but handed over to the @entity18 yesterday after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money			1
home sweet home : @entity11 pictured outside her @entity26 council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the government to spend ' as they may think fit			1
' but despite her wealth @entity31 , 90 , lived in the modest council home in @entity26 where she was born and raised			0
friends say she still washed in a tin bath and lived mainly off vegetables she grew in a small plot in the garden			1
local people dubbed her ‘ the last @entity40 ’ because she lived such a strict and pious life - wearing a plain outfit and a hat with a feather in			1
she would scold noisy children playing outside her home - which she once had the chance to buy for £ 2,000 but declined the council ’s offer			2
modest : the ordinary semi-detached property which miss @entity11 lived in all her life , under the right to buy the scheme she was offered the chance to buy it for just £ 2,000 but refused frugal : inside the home where @entity11 lived all her life , sparsely furnished and with bare floorboards @entity11 also would not allow @entity60 to put in new windows or kitchen preferring to keep things the way she had always known them			1
the new occupants , @entity67 and @entity68 , said the local authority had to revamp the property before they could move in last march			0
mrs @entity71 said : ' we have heard about her			0
she still had all the cladding in the bedroom and the wooden beams			0
' the council said she refused to allow them to do the kitchen , put central heating in or touch the windows			1
' neighbour @entity80 , 71 , said walking into the former nurse ’s home was like stepping back in time			2
the last @entity40 : miss @entity11 pictured shortly before her death and , right , as a child in 1931 , was well known amongst her neighbours for strict and pious lifestyle he said : ' i used to call her the last @entity40			1
there would be kids playing in the street and she would come out and tell them off			0
' she would also dress in a very old fashioned way with laced up boots and a hat with a feather in it			0
she certainly was n’t trendy			0
' mr @entity80 , who lives opposite and had known miss @entity11 for 40 years , added : ' walking into her house was like going back in time			1
' she had no central heating , instead using an old gas stove and boiler			1
in her bathroom there was a big standalone cast iron bath			2
' she had a small electric heater in her bedroom and a slightly bigger one in the lounge , where there was also a @entity111 dresser			0
' it seemed like the house had hardly been touched since the day it was first built			0
simple taste : miss @entity11 refused to have central heating and double glazing installed in her home , preferring to use small electric heaters and a tin bath ' she must have used coal as well , because she asked me one day if i knew anybody who would want it			1
' she had a vegetable patch in the garden that i would help with , although she did n’t use that as much as she got older			2
' considering how much money she had you , would have thought she could have lived more comfortably			0
' even though the council had revamped the house which she lived in since 1931 , miss @entity11 ' home still has some of the original fittings including wooden beams and floorboards			2
@entity138 described her as a ' churchgoing and highly intelligent ' lady who turned down the chance to buy her £ 160,000 house for just £ 2,000 under the right - to - buy scheme			0
miss @entity11 estate has been at the centre of a political storm when instead of spending the money on the @entity150 , schools or to ease the national debt , the @entity148 shared the £ 519,999 between them as a party donation			1
stunned : neighbours @entity155 , 44 , and @entity156 , 44 , were shocked to discover how much miss @entity11 was worth after witnessing the frugal way she lived			1
with bare floors and a modest decor her home was a time capsule to years gone by and revealed nothing of the £ 500,000 stash of cash she left to the government when she died into the time warp : miss @entity11 ' neigbours said walking through her door was like stepping back in time but after a backlash , leaders handed the cash over to the treasury meaning it will go back into the public purse rather than fund the parties			1
her friend , @entity177 , 85 , said she thought miss @entity11 had been a conservative , and had made her money buying and selling shares			2
when she wrote her will in 2001 , @entity181 were in power , having just won their second term in a landslide victory			0
@entity181 @entity187 mp @entity186 criticised those who allowed the donation to be accepted in teh first place saying she believes they were ' blinded ' by greed			2
she said : ' it seems to me utterly inconceivable that a bequest to " the government of the day " could be interpreted as a donation to the @entity16 and @entity17 to spend on electioneering			0
' i want to know what questions were asked when the money came in , and whether the parties were involved in any discussions with the executors beforehand as to how the money was to be split - a conversation that surely should have rung alarm bells			0
' i can only assume that greed blinded them to the questions that should have been asked			0
' @entity11 was obviously a very private person and would no doubt be horrified by all this attention , but now that her legacy is in the public domain , i think that rather than it just being swallowed up in the @entity18 coffers , it would be a decent gesture to use at least part of her legacy to fund something close to her heart , such as the excellent new birth centre down the road at @entity222 hospital , training for nurses at nearby @entity225 or replacing some of the 681 nurses that @entity26 trust has lost since 2010			2

former nurse @entity11 was dubbed ' the last @entity40 ' by neighbours
the ninety - year - old refused central heating and double glazing
she preferred to wash in a tin bath and eat vegetables from her garden
@entity239 have handed donation to the treasury after outrage that is was accepted as a party donation
