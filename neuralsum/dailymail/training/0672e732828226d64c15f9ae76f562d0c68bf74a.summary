by @entity0 iconic design company @entity1 celebrates its golden anniversary this month - and these charming pictures show just how far the furniture giant has come since it ’s launch in 1964			1
the brainchild of interiors designer @entity7 , @entity1 was an instant hit as it arrived on @entity11 's @entity10 in the midst of the @entity13			1
hip , young @entity14 flocked to the store for its cool interiors and fashionable furniture , and the concept of contemporary lifestyle shopping in @entity20 was born			2
happy birthday habitat ! the design company is celebrating fifty years in the furniture business this month before launching @entity1 with the help of his wife @entity25 , the editor of @entity27 , businessman @entity28 and model @entity29 , @entity7 had been frustrated by the distinctly old - fashioned approach to furniture stores in the @entity20 , ‘ we see ourselves as the @entity38 of the furnishing world , ’ @entity7 told @entity33 in 1964 , a nod to the iconic fashion designer who is credited for inventing the mini-skirt			1
@entity7 wanted to replicate the forward - thinking approach to retailing that had emerged in @entity42			0
as part of his home furnishings shakeup , @entity7 introduced the humble duvet to the @entity20 in the same year , after coming across one on his travels in @entity47			1
before then @entity20 people slept under blankets with hospital corners			0
unsurprisingly the duvet - or ' continental quilt ' as it was called - became a sensation			0
two years later , in 1966 , the second habitat store opened in @entity55			1
the same year , the company started to print magazine - style brochures featuring photography rather than hand - drawn images of products			1
prior to that all catalogues , including the original 1966 @entity1 one , were hand - drawn			2
@entity1 was one of the first @entity20 stores to introduce editorial - style features in their brochures , such as recipe extracts and how - tos on decorating your home vintage : @entity1 's first by - post catalogue inthe 1960s , left , and a bedroom shot from a later catalogue in the 1970s , right			1
brits flocked to the home furnishings store when it opened in 1964 the @entity1 brand went international in 1973 with a store opening in @entity80 , and by 1980 there were 47 stores open around the globe in 1969 @entity7 launched @entity1 's first mail order catalogue - @entity84 - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those who could not reach its @entity11 stores			1
and , long before @entity89 , @entity7 and his team were the first mainstream brand to commercialise the idea of taking away flat - packed furniture and building it yourself at home @entity7 was in fact doing this in 1952 , but @entity1 was the champion of flat - packing in the 1970s			1
their campus range was key to this , being wildly popular with students			0
the original @entity104 store moved to @entity105 in 1973 , the same year that the brand went international , with a store opening in @entity80			2
by 1980 , there were 47 stores open around the globe			0
forward - thinking : @entity1 were one of the first stores to utilise the concept of taking away flat - packed furniture and building it yourself at home			1
their campus range was wildly popular with students controversial : the controversial duvet cover advert that received hundreds of complaints because it featured a scantily - clad mixed race couple , left , and another 1970s catalogue shot , right back in the habit : @entity1 's winter catalogue from 1971 , left , and it 's catalogue from 1975 , right			1
by 1973 , when the flagship store moved from @entity10 to the larger and more prominent @entity105 , it also opened it 's first international store in @entity80 in the 1970s @entity1 became known as a brand that liked to push the boundaries , causing a stir in 1973 when it featured a mixed - race couple in bed for a duvet advert			1
criticised for representing ‘ un-british sex , ’ @entity1 were flooded with complaints			0
but they had the last laugh as the duvet cover collection from this photo went on to become one of their best sellers			0
to this day , duvets are still one of @entity147 best - selling products			0
@entity7 withdrew from the business in 1990 , but the brand continued to grow and create the latest home decor trends			0
as @entity20 ’s obsession with celebrity grew by the noughties , @entity1 – true to form – was n’t far behind			2
in 2004 it launched vip collections with the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
however , the noughties also saw the rise of high street retailers offering their own furniture and homewear - often at a much lower price			0
for the first time , @entity1 saw a dramatic fall in sales			1
home comforts : as part of it 's home furnishings shakeup , @entity1 changed the way we sleep forever , after bringing the duvet to the @entity20 from @entity47 in 1969 , @entity1 launched its first mail order catalogue - @entity84 - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those who could not reach its @entity11 stores the extent of its financial failings meant the closure of all it 's stores except the three @entity11 flagships ones in @entity105 , @entity55 and @entity183 in the summer of 2011			1
in 2012 , @entity184 , formerly of @entity7 , was appointed @entity185 of the brand and set the task of bringing @entity1 's success back			2
a spokesperson told @entity190 : ' it 's taken a few years , but now our collections are back on form and we are launching new mini stores around the @entity20			0
' these are proving hugely popular so we are on track to have 50 by the end of the year			0
we 've refocused on original mantra that useful can be beautiful and beautiful can be affordable and people are discovering the brand again			0
' now @entity1 is celebrating its 50th birthday and plans to open 50 new mini habitat stores across the @entity20 by end of year , including one on in @entity205 , @entity206 on friday			2
do it yourself : a guide to ' quick assembly ' furniture from a @entity1 brochure in the 1980s bright ideas ! a @entity1 catalogue from the 1980s depicts furnishings in colourful block colours , synoymous with the trends of that era			0
by now , @entity1 had 47 stores around the world always on hand : @entity1 was one of the first stores in @entity20 to feature magazine - style editorial features inside their catalogues , giving helpful tips and advice as well as promoting their products clean living : @entity1 helped pioneer the minimalist trend of interior design during the 1980s , as pictured here in one of their catalogues from the era early days : pictures from @entity1 's first ever catalogue in 1966 , before colour photography featured in the brochures			1
the illustrations are by @entity240 with words by @entity242 , wife of @entity7 retro : @entity1 celebrates its golden anniversary this month - and these charming pictures show just how far the furniture giant has come since the launch in 1964 way back when : @entity1 's brochure from the 1960s			2
using colour photography in catalogues instead of hand - drawn pictures was new at the time			0
