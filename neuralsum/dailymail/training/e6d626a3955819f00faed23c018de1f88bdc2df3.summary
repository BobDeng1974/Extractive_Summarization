ditched : @entity0 , 35 , has left his job at a @entity3 high school after an ' anti-banter ' blog post a supply teacher who banned the word ' banter ' in his classroom because it ' encouraged bullying ' has left his job - and says he feels like he was ' forced out '			1
@entity0 , 35 , stepped down from @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity3 , after claiming his teaching agency phoned him to say his services were ' no longer required '			1
he was called into a meeting with the head teacher on monday , where it was agreed he would look for work elsewhere , he said			2
the teacher had sparked a national debate with his blog about ' banter ' just two months after starting a career in @entity24 , where he emigrated after spending 12 years working in schools in @entity27 and @entity28			1
mr @entity0 , who was on a three - month contract he hoped would be made permanent , described how he was banning the term because he believed teenage pupils used it to evade punishment and trivialise bullying			1
his blog post was shared online and published by educational supplements , sparking division among readers and - according to mr @entity0 - the silent treatment from colleages in the staff room			1
he announced he had left his job in a follow - up blog post , writing : ' i find myself wondering sometimes whether that job should even be in the classroom			1
i still ca n’t work out whether what i said was the right thing to say			2
' what i do know is that speaking up as a teacher can have a pretty hefty cost			2
it is up to each of us separately to decide whether it ’s worth it			2
' mr @entity0 said he had agreed to leave with immediate effect after visiting a doctor who signed him off for stress after the episode			1
' i received a called from my agency saying that things had broken down and basically my services were no longer required , ' he added today			2
' i then phoned the headteacher and agreed to speak with her on monday			0
i think the worst thing about the whole thing is the way i have been treated			0
' critics had slammed the teacher 's blog post i 'm @entity70 ! , in which he suggested pupils used the word to excuse bad behaviour			1
moving on : @entity0 has left his post at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity3 ( pictured ) after writing a blog post about how he had banned the word ' banter ' in class ' banter , once a term that was used to signify " light - hearted joking , a gentle ribbing of a friend " , now seems to be a catch - all term for any sort of off - colour or inappropriate behaviour , ' he wrote			1
' if i catch somebody nicking someone ’s pencilcase , calling another student a derogatory name or thumping them on the back , nine times out of ten i ’ll be met with a " @entity98 , it ’s just bantaaaaaaaah ! " '			0
after being published by the @entity99 and shared on social media websites , mr @entity0 attracted an onslaught of criticism for his view , with some readers labelling him ' pompous and arrogant ' , while others described him as ' a lefty idiot '			1
but mr @entity0 - who used to be an education blogger for the @entity108 - stood by his opinions today , telling @entity110 it was important to have a public debate			1
mr @entity0 said colleagues are restricted and ' terrified of the way schools observe them ' ' if you have a private conversation things just are n't going to change , ' he said			1
' if you throw it open to the marketplace of ideas it 's going to have a much bigger impact			0
' i think the fallout is a shame and it says something about the way teachers have to work			0
' i know colleagues who have trained and worked here who are terrified of the way schools observe them and make them teach to a certain style			0
' everyone has a different style and if we all spent all our time looking at spreadsheets and targets the world would be a much poorer place for it '			0
he is not leaving @entity24 , however , where he has gained citizenship due to his family 's roots here			0
' i love @entity24 , ' he said			0
' i 'm a @entity24 citizen and i want to stick around			0
' in the aftermath of the row , mr @entity0 says staff at the school where he was teaching ' went quiet ' and accused him of putting the school at risk of unwanted attention			1
' i made a crack about how i ’d made the papers while someone else who proposed dropping @entity155 as a subject had n’t had any response , ' he wrote			1
' i was given the impression that i could have brought down @entity159 on the school ( they ’d been there the previous week ) and that the kids might think i thought they were poorly behaved – that might be why i was getting the reception i was getting			2
' tv shows such as @entity166 and @entity167 have popularised the use of the word ' banter ' , spawning catchphrases including ' @entity175 ' , ' archbishop of @entity172 ' and ' @entity173 '			1
at least one group of people saw the funny side - the pupils			0
he wrote : ' everywhere i went i was greeted with shouts of " banter ! "			2
' i decided to laugh with them , turning around in mock horror when somebody shouted it			0
the tone changed from a cautious hostility to something a lot warmer			0
' a couple of kids came up to me and asked why i ’d made my comments			0
i told them that i was n’t opposed to banter - just using it as an excuse for giving others a hard time			2
once we had the conversation , the kids were fine and the majority agreed with me			0
' @entity110 contacted @entity202 , but was told it was providing no comment			1
wide currency : tv shows such as @entity166 ( pictured ) and @entity167 have spawned catchphrases such as ' @entity175 ' , ' archbishop of @entity172 ' and ' @entity173 '			0
