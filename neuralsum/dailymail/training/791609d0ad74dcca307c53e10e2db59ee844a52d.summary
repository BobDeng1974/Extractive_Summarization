by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 17:21 est , 10 october 2013 a study has found that one in ten older mothers have premature babies one in ten mothers aged 40 and over gives birth to a premature baby , according to official figures			1
older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with younger women			2
data from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) showed that 10.1 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were delivered before 37 weeks in @entity14 and @entity15 in 2011			1
this is up slightly on the 9.5 per cent figure for 2007 and compares with 6.7 per cent for mothers aged 25 to 29			1
the number of live births to mothers aged 40 and over has more than quadrupled over the past three decades – from 6,519 in 1982 to 29,994 in 2012			1
a normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks , with a delivery before 37 weeks considered premature			0
analysis by the @entity11 showed that part of the reason for the higher percentage of older mothers giving birth prematurely may be because they are more likely to have twins or triplets			2
in 2011 , 6.2 per cent of babies born to mothers aged 40 or over were multiple births , compared with just 1.2 per cent of babies born to mothers in their teens			1
only 5.6 per cent of single births are premature , compared with more than half of babies in multiple pregnancies			0
there are now more than 60,000 premature births in @entity42 every year – a record level driven by multiple births caused by @entity45 treatment and planned @entity47 deliveries			1
older mothers are 50 per cent more likely to give birth too soon compared with younger women , a study has revealed it places a large burden on the @entity52 , with advances in medical science driving up survival rates among premature babies			2
but they are still more at risk of dying and in need of intensive care , while those infants who survive are at greater risk of being disabled			0
@entity64 , director for midwifery at the @entity66 , said : ‘ these figures support our calls for enough midwives to provide care to the increasing number of older mothers who need more time , attention and monitoring throughout their pregnancy			0
‘ it demonstrates that births are becoming increasingly complex as more older women give birth , along with other issues such as obesity			0
‘ this also demonstrates the need for continuity of care for women , which will reap benefits for older women who tend to have more complicated pregnancies			0
‘ these women also need extra care after birth as they have a small baby or babies			0

number of live births to mothers aged 40 and over has quadrupled
women who wait to have children are more likely to have twins or triplets
60,000 babies are born prematurely in @entity42 every year
