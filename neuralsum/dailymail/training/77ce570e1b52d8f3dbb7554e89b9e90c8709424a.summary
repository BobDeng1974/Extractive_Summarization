by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:28 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:58 est , 16 december 2013 it 's the morning after the @entity4 before , and there 's an army of gremlins doing the hokey - cokey inside your dry and frazzled skull			2
the children have started a steel kitchenware band , the dog 's digesting the stair carpet , your phone is bleeping with a thousand ' @entity17 ? ' messages , and the idea of even switching on the kettle ( let alone venturing into the office ) makes your head spin			0
hallelujah , then , that the fine people at @entity24 have come up with a solution : the @entity4 hangover cure , delivered directly to your home or workplace , that includes a breakfast roll , a vitamin shot , a fruit smoothie and , naturally , a packet of chocolate - covered bacon			1
do n't let your hangover beat you , order the @entity36 from grazing and knock your dehydration headache on the head before noon the @entity4 season can be brutal , so make sure you have a couple of morning - after tricks up your sleeve research has shown that a lack of productivity the next day means that @entity4 parties are more expensive for employers than just a bar bill and a plate of sausage rolls			1
grazing 's @entity36 intends to save companies cash and leave staff feeling less prone to pulling a sickie			2
the menu , created by a team of chefs in the city , features a fried egg and bacon buttie and provides a combination of nutrients , carbohydrates and protein to give s workers an energy boost			1
the food - which costs £ 12.95 per box , with a minimum order of 10 - is transported and kept warm in @entity24 's pioneering hot boxes			1
other items available from @entity24 's menu include the @entity73 , veggie sausage buttie , the @entity76 muffins and a mushroom omelette			1
do n't knock chocolate - covered bacon until you 've tried it , it 's a curiously delicious mix of savoury and sweet , that indescribable umami flavour each box contains : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 : packed full of superfoods , this amazing smoothie is a favourite with celebrities			1
the fruits and vegetables contained are cold - pressed rather than heated , to maximise the nutrients , antioxidants and vitamins , and the natural sugars in this healthy mix rehydrate the body , getting the alcohol out of your system quicker			2
fausts awake potion : this miracle - in - a - bottle comprises amino acids , guarana , green tea , ginseng , @entity111 and @entity112 and electrolytes			2
it works wonders for busy professionals by neutralising the effects of a hangover			0
it helps the body replace lost nutrients , banishing classic symptoms such as headaches and sluggishness that leave you feeling worse for wear			0
@entity127 : hangovers can cause blood sugar levels to drop			0
but hot , grilled @entity131 back bacon with a fried free - range egg , sandwiched in a soft white roll , with classic condiments ( ketchup and @entity136 ) on the side ought to help			1
eggs and bacon are both rich in cysteine , an amino acid that aids the breakdown of toxins , while loading up on carbohydrates also helps redress the balance			0
@entity150 aside , if an egg and bacon buttie does n't help ease the pain of the morning after the night before , it will at the very least satiate even the most severe cases of munchies			1
@entity153 : ca n't decide between sweet or savoury ? not a problem			0
this seriously moreish combination of slow - cooked crispy bacon lardons - made from free - range @entity131 bacon - dipped in melted @entity160 chocolate has the best of both			2
sounds strange , but these chewy treats are a decadently delicious mid-morning pick - me - up			0
plus , they 're full of potassium , which gets depleted when you drink , causing you to feel sick and dehydrated			0
just what the doctor ordered here 's one fella who will definitely be needing a grazing box come @entity174			0
