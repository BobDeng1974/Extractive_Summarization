so @entity0 stamped on @entity1			1
and it was probably deliberate			2
and he might get charged and banned and it fits with the image of his snarling style , as the centrepiece of a compelling and aggressive @entity10 semi-final			2
@entity11 , the referee , missed it , apparently			1
cue an explosion of outrage and opinion in support of increasing the use of technology in a hd world where a zillion television cameras scrutinise every move from every angle and everyone ’s an expert			1
and yet the very reason this tie was so exciting and memorable , played at breath - taking speed , with great commitment was down to the fact it was allowed to flow by a referee who tried to keep 22 players on the field			1
is that necessarily bad refereeing ? @entity0 may still be charged for his apparent stamp on @entity35 @entity0 also appeared to stamp on @entity36 after skipping over a challenge in the second half @entity0 and @entity36 square up after the incident , for which the striker avoided a card @entity43 confronted referee @entity11 in the the tunnel at half - time @entity11 did well to keep control of what proved to be a fiery and passionate game @entity11 helped the spectacle			1
sure , he was lenient			2
he might have sent off @entity0 , more than once			2
he might have given him a penalty			2
he might have sent off @entity51			2
or @entity57 , for that matter , although this current fixation of passing judgment on what is ball - to - hand or hand - to - ball is simply ridiculous			1
arms move when people move			0
if football is going to be refereed in super slow - motion by officials sat in a glass box in the stands leafing through imperfect rule - books , then let ’s forget thrilling football matches like the one at @entity69			1
let ’s forget those who tackle for a living			0
or those who thrive on physical contact , who exist on the edge and push the rules ; those who inspire and lead others with their desire to succeed			0
let ’s bid farewell to the relentless pace of the game and those brilliant technicians who can perform with a football in the heat of these fierce contests			1
those like @entity90 , who produced a fabulous display despite the fact that @entity1 ’s first reaction almost every time @entity90 received the ball was to grab for him with his hands			0
or @entity97 taking on the muscle of @entity99 and @entity100 with his pace and trickery			0
@entity0 appeared to grab @entity104 's throat during another incident @entity104 and @entity0 had to be pulled apart by team - mates after going head - to - head on tuesday night also , while we ’re at it , draw a line under the debate and the dissent which fuels the passion which stirs the blood and generates a fantastic atmosphere , even in the modern venues built for corporate dining			1
of course , let ’s strive for fairness			0
let ’s stop violence and intimidation			0
let ’s send off those who do n’t deserve to stay on			0
but do n’t sterilise these matches			0
these are what made the sport the world ’s favourite			0
if football has become too important to let mistakes to slip by then the game is in trouble			1
there is too much money at stake to allow imperfections			0
whose fault is that ? do not change the best game in the world for the sake of money by killing the tempo with slow - motion investigations			1
and he might get charged and banned but only one person truly knows whether it was a pre-meditated attack , an opportunistic strike or a complete accident			0
let money take its chance			0
let the referees do their best			0
relax and enjoy the game			1
what a game that was .			1

@entity11 could have sent off several players during tuesday 's game
his *decision* not too , however , allowed the game to be free - flowing
video technology would have led to more stoppages in the game
