by @entity0 when you reach the ripe old age of 160million , life can surely hold few surprises			2
but even @entity6 the diplodocus might have raised an eyebrow yesterday when someone paid nearly half a million pounds to give her a new home			2
her skeleton , which measures 55ft long and is taller than a double - decker bus , was sold at auction for £ 488,000			1
ready for her close - up : @entity6 is dusted off for auction at @entity15 in @entity16 relic : the ancient skeleton was found in the @entity20 state of @entity21 in 2009 the sale was a new chapter in the life ( and death ) of @entity6 , a magnificent diplodocus longus who roamed the earth in the late @entity30 period			1
full diplodocus skeletons are extremely rare			1
even @entity32 , the celebrated centrepiece of the @entity34 in @entity35 , is a plaster - cast replica drawn from two sets of remains , and it was 1877 before any fossilised remains of a diplodocus were discovered			1
what no one knew then was that @entity6 was waiting to be unearthed in @entity42 , a fossil - rich quarry in @entity21 owned by renowned paleontologist @entity43			1
one day in 2009 he sent his two young sons out ‘ to get them off my back ’ and to see what they could dig up			0
to his astonishment , they returned saying they had discovered an enormous bone beneath the silt			0
@entity43 ’s professional team spent the next nine weeks digging out the dinosaur , which they nicknamed @entity6 , short for @entity53			0
scrubbed up : @entity6 was bought anonymously by a private institution - but they promised to keep her on display lengthy : @entity6 is 55ft long , thanks to her huge neck and tail she was found at the edge of a dried - up watering hole and is believed to have come to grief after her enormous weight - probably 15 tons - caused her to get stuck in the mud			1
predatory dinosaurs probably did the rest			0
her remains were collected and shipped off to be painstakingly prepared at a leading fossil laboratory in the @entity68			0
she was sent to @entity69 for reassembly and put up for sale at @entity73 auctions in @entity16			0

dig : @entity6 was excavated by a team led by paleontologist @entity83 getting stuck in : mr @entity43 revealed that @entity6 was found when he sent his son out digging one afternoon it was overseen by auction curator and natural history specialist @entity88 , who recently wrote a book with sir @entity90 and is an expert on extinct species			1
mr @entity88 is a friend of mr @entity43 and helped bring @entity6 to @entity93 when the paleontologist , who is @entity95 , said he wanted to auction her in @entity96			2
‘ i ’m sure the @entity20 are upset at losing it , ’ mr @entity88 said			0
‘ but they already have two or three of them in collections			0
’ it is understood interest was shown from the fast - developing natural history market in @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106			2
in the end she was bought anonymously for an unnamed private institution – with a pledge to put her on public display .			1
