one of the world ’s biggest banks was accused of breathtaking arrogance yesterday for handing a £ 367m pay bonanza to its @entity5 staff			1
the staggering sum is being shared out among 121 @entity8 bosses and traders – at an average of £ 3million a head			1
campaigners said the payouts were obscene and accused the @entity15 bank of ‘ sneaking the details out while no one is watching ’			1
@entity23 of the @entity24 said : ‘ this is a classic case of trying to bury bad news			2
' this behaviour just underlines the breathtaking arrogance of the banking industry which thinks it can get away with anything			0
’ @entity31 , a @entity32 mp on the @entity33 in the @entity34 , said : ‘ @entity8 will struggle to find a biblical justification for this greed			1
they obviously wanted to sneak this out when everyone was celebrating @entity39 , hoping no one would notice			0
this just reinforces the message that the bankers that caused us so many problems are out of control and out of touch			0
’ the @entity8 pay and bonuses , which are for 2013 , were handed out just in time to beat a cap introduced by the @entity52 12 months ago			1
and they comfortably eclipsed the £ 1.3million average among 13 @entity5 banks in the same year , according to research by @entity58 news			1
the staggering sum is being shared out among 121 @entity8 bosses and traders			1
group vice-chairman @entity62 is pictured @entity64 performers at @entity65 in @entity5 averaged £ 1.6million while their counterparts at state - backed @entity67 were on £ 600,000			1
none of the top employees at @entity8 were individually identified in the documents filed to the stock market yesterday			1
but they would include @entity62 , who is the head of the bank ’s @entity75 operation and is thought to be @entity75 ’s highest paid banker			0
he scooped around £ 12.8million in pay and perks for 2013			2
the new cap restricts banks to paying a maximum bonus of one year ’s salary , rising to twice salary if shareholders approve			0
all the major banks have tried to sidestep these restrictions by introducing six - and seven - figure fixed allowances to bolster the basic pay packages of senior staff			0
this also means they can pay a bigger bonus , because it is calculated as a multiple of their basic pay – including the new allowances			2
@entity52 rules require banks to reveal how many ‘ code staff ’ – those who take and manage risks – they employ and how much they are paid in cash and shares each year			1
but while its rivals published these details months ago , @entity8 – which employs around 5,500 people in @entity5 – chose to release the details just before the @entity39 deadline			1
this week it emerged that @entity67 boss @entity114 plans to accept a £ 1million fixed allowance in 2015 , having forfeited it this year to avoid a row over pay			1
last month , chancellor @entity119 dropped his attempt to challenge the @entity52 cap on bonuses after it was dismissed by the legal adviser to the @entity124			0
the chancellor said the new rules were ‘ badly designed ’ and would serve only to inflate bankers ’ pay			2
he has warned previously that a cap might have a ‘ perverse effect ’ , saying ‘ it may undermine responsibility on the banking system rather than promote it ’ by increasing the size of salaries			2
the @entity135 also warned that the cap could have the ‘ undesirable side - effect ’ of limiting how much cash regulators can confiscate for wrongdoing			2
the @entity67 ’s governor @entity140 said rules may need to be introduced that also allow bankers ’ fixed pay to be clawed back if they are found guilty of misconduct			1
the @entity146 said : ‘ standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus or fixed pay at risk			0
’ @entity8 – the most powerful investment bank in the world – has long seen itself as a cut above its rivals and had earned the nickname @entity155			1
last month , chancellor @entity119 dropped his attempt to challenge the @entity52 cap on bonuses after it was dismissed by the legal adviser to the @entity124 in the wake of the financial crisis , the bank ’s @entity159 chief executive , @entity158 , infamously described himself as ‘ doing @entity164 ’s work ’ and argued that banks have a vital ‘ social purpose ’ to create wealth and jobs			2
@entity169 , @entity170 spokesman , said : ‘ excessive bonuses are n’t just in stark contrast with the hard times for the vast majority of the rest of society – they have encouraged risky behaviour where the bankers get the rewards and the taxpayer foots the bill if everything goes wrong			1
' this underlines the case for repeating the banker bonus levy that worked well in 2009 but was abandoned by @entity119			0
‘ it ’s clear that banking reform is unfinished business and the government should n’t allow the banking sector to return to business as usual			0
’ @entity192 , head of the @entity193 , said ordinary employees should be given a seat on banks ’ remuneration committees to help rein in pay			0
she said : ‘ risk - taking banks caused the global crash , yet while pay for the many has fallen every year since 2008 top bankers are still raking it in			0
‘ it ’s time their pay came out of the stratosphere and back to planet earth			0
‘ let us make 2015 the year in which employees get a voice on remuneration committees			0
’ the @entity75 ’s biggest high street lenders will start announcing their bonuses for the past year in the coming weeks			0
@entity67 made losses of £ 8.2billion last year but still paid out £ 588million in bonuses			1
it is expected to make its first full year profit since the financial crisis			0
the pay packages of @entity8 ’ top four executives show how generous the bank is with its most senior staff : @entity62 group vice-chairman , based in @entity5 pay in 2013 : £ 12.8million @entity62 – ‘ @entity227 ’ to his friends – is a leading @entity8 money - maker and is thought to be @entity75 ’s most highly paid banker			1

he is a keen table tennis player and sponsors sporting charities to keep children off the streets			0
@entity158 chief executive and chairman , based in @entity243 pay in 2013 : £ 14.7million @entity158 , 60 , infamously declared in the heat of the financial crisis in 2009 that he was doing ‘ @entity164 ’s work ’			1
but for many he has become the poster child for fat - cat pay and capitalism at its most cut - throat			0
the son of a truck driver from the @entity253 , he was pocketing £ 45million a year before the crisis in 2007 – a record for any @entity15 boss			2
the @entity258 graduate became chief executive in 2006 when his predecessor , @entity260 , left to become the treasury secretary in the @entity263 administration			0
on his watch , @entity264 has been accused of profiting at its clients ’ expense by betting on property prices falling , while selling investments that relied on a rising market			2
