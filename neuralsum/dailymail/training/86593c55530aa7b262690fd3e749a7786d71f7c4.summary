@entity1 was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder in the wake of @entity5 ’s death , court papers reveal			1
the @entity7 frontman has been largely silent about his feelings since his girlfriend of 13 years hanged herself on march 17			0
but privately he was left so upset that he was told by a doctor not to perform for a month , according to papers filed in an £ 8million battle between the band and their insurers			1
the stones were forced to postpone the @entity17 and @entity18 leg of their world tour when miss @entity5 died – but their insurers refused to pay out , saying their policy did not cover suicide			1
if these symptoms continue for more than a month it becomes post-traumatic stress disorder , often associated with soldiers returning from war zones			1
in a @entity39 filing as part of the fight with their insurers , the band state : ‘ upon learning of miss @entity5 ’s death , sir @entity1 became stricken with grief			1
‘ following examination by his physicians , sir @entity1 was diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder			1
his physicians advised [ him ] not to perform for at least 30 days			0
’ the @entity7 had taken out a £ 15million policy to cover the costs if they were forced to cancel their tour			1
but the underwriters claim that because miss @entity5 committed suicide , they do not have to pay out the £ 8million the band are demanding			1
the disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into @entity1 ’s feelings			2
he has so far given only one brief interview about miss @entity5 ’s suicide			2
in a statement , he said he would ‘ never forget her ’ , adding : ‘ i am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way			1
’ her death has resulted in a bitter insurance battle on two continents , with lawsuits filed in the @entity72 and in @entity73			2
@entity1 was ' diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder ' after @entity76 's death and was advised by doctors not to perform for at least 30 days in july , the @entity7 sued their insurers in the @entity39 , alleging that they had ‘ failed and refused ’ to pay the £ 8million , and seeking interest and costs on top of that sum			1
the eight insurers are led by @entity84 and @entity85 , both based in @entity73			0
they responded by claiming that miss @entity5 ’s death was not ‘ sudden and unforeseen ’ or ‘ beyond her control ’ and so did not qualify for a payout			1
they also claimed it was ‘ reasonable to infer miss @entity5 had been suffering from a mental illness ’ that was ‘ traceable to , or accelerated by , a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention ’			1
a pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout			0
the insurers appeared to dispute the idea that @entity1 , 71 , was so deeply upset , and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination			1
they wrote : ‘ it does not appear that sir @entity1 was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder			1
’ court documents revealed that @entity1 has 18 people on his insurance policy , including ms @entity5 , @entity115 , seven children and four grandchildren the @entity7 frontman published a statement on his website soon after @entity5 's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life the only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor , who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient , the papers state			1
last month , the insurers filed a lawsuit in @entity134 ’s @entity133 , and subpoenaed @entity135 , the executor of @entity76 ’s will , the @entity134 medical examiner , and @entity138 , her @entity140 assistant , in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘ actual or alleged attempt at self harm by @entity76 ’ as well as her general mental health , or an ‘ actual or alleged suicide attempt ’			1
meanwhile in @entity151 , where miss @entity5 grew up , a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from miss @entity5 ’s brother , @entity155 , to find out more about her mental state			2
however , mr @entity155 told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons			0
miss @entity5 , a fashion designer and model , was 49 when her body was found in her @entity162 apartment by @entity163			2
an autopsy confirmed her death was suicide			2
her fashion business had been £ 4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at @entity170 , supposedly due to technical difficulties			0
there were also reports she and @entity1 had split up , leaving her ‘ devastated ’ , although @entity1 ’s spokesman denied this			2
documents filed at the district court in @entity178 , @entity151 , reveal miss @entity5 was on a long list of family on the @entity7 ’ insurance policy			1
also on @entity1 ’s list were his ex-wives @entity115 and @entity184 , former girlfriends , seven children and four grandchildren			0
the documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked			0
the revenue for the tour was expected to be £ 28million , and this could have gone up if 15 extra @entity194 dates were added			0
the insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy			2
a spokesman for the @entity7 declined to comment			0
lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment			0
hell - raisers : @entity204 and @entity205 the @entity7 may still be going strong , but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle			0
hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered			0
for example , and perhaps not surprisingly , the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist @entity205 related to ‘ alcohol abuse , liver failure and / or disease and osteoarthritis ’			2
more unusually , anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006 , when he was hit on the head by a coconut , will not be covered either			0
for @entity204 , anything to do with ‘ alcohol abuse ’ is also not covered			0
the exemptions for drummer @entity232 include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica			0
the documents show the band expected to receive £ 28million for their tour			0
just three shows in @entity241 were worth £ 9million .			0
