former environment secretary @entity0 will this week deliver a stark warning – that @entity2 will ' run out of electricity ' unless it abandons its main green energy target			1
mr @entity0 , who was sacked from the @entity5 in this summer 's reshuffle , will argue in a lecture that the target enshrined in the @entity9 – which binds the @entity2 to reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 – is unaffordable			1
he will go on to say that the current energy policy is a ' slave to flawed climate action ' , and warn that ' in the short and medium term costs to consumers will rise dramatically '			1
former environment secretary @entity0 will argue that @entity2 will ' run out of electricity ' unless it abandons its main green energy target in wednesday 's lecture , organised by the ' sceptic ' think - tank @entity19 , which is chaired by former @entity21 chancellor @entity20 , he will say : ' there can only be one ultimate consequence : the lights will go out			1
' because the @entity9 forces @entity2 to invest in renewable electricity sources , mainly wind , he claims it ' blocks other feasible policies that would cut both emissions and costs '			1
previous energy secretaries – @entity31 's @entity30 and the @entity33 ' @entity32 – claimed to want to help the poor , he will say			0
but mr @entity0 believes their actions led to ' the most regressive policy since the @entity38 ' – with vast subsidies on consumers ' bills going straight to the pockets of landowners and green investors			1
at an event organised by the ' sceptic ' think - tank @entity19 , the former minister will say : ' there can only be one ultimate consequence : the lights will go out ' he will go on to stress that although he has been accused of being a ' climate denier ' , he accepts the main points of greenhouse theory			1
but he will point out that temperatures have risen much more slowly than scientists predicted , while by some measures , the current ' pause ' in global warming has already lasted for 18 years			0
to stand a chance of meeting its obligations , @entity2 should be building a new giant nuclear power station every three years , as well as thousands more of the turbines which have ' devastated landscapes , blighted views , killed eagles and carpeted the very wilderness that [ greens ] claim to love '			2
instead , mr @entity0 will argue , policy should focus on supplying cheap energy and cutting emissions			1
this , he says , can best be done by fracking for shale gas and building small gas and nuclear - powered electricity stations			0
mr @entity0 told @entity77 that adding green energy costs to people 's household bills and building onshore wind farms are policies that are sending @entity21 voters into the arms of @entity85 – the only party committed to scrapping them			2
' @entity85 's opposition to green energy targets and wind is tapping a tremendous tide of anger felt across the country , ' mr @entity0 said , adding : ' everywhere i go , this issue comes up all the time			2
you could live with that if the policy was actually working , but it 's not			0
if we change direction on this it will make a huge difference			0
' it 's an opportunity for the @entity104 to steal one of @entity85 's most popular campaigns			0
' changing course would require the @entity9 's suspension , and possibly its eventual repeal , while the separate targets imposed by the @entity111 would have to be part of the treaty renegotiation mr @entity114 has promised if the @entity104 win next year 's election			0
mr @entity0 insisted he was not trying to embarrass the @entity21 leadership , saying : ' i want to be seen as a constructive critic			2
' he added : ' i represent people who are not well off , old age pensioners , people who run businesses , and they 've all got to pay their bills			0
' under current policy , we will fail on emissions targets , and we will fail to deliver a reliable energy supply			2
' i think a large majority of @entity21 mps will be sympathetic to what i 'm saying			0

@entity0 will warn energy policy is a ' slave to flawed climate action '
@entity2 is aiming to reduce carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050
former environment secretary will argue this target is ' unaffordable '
he will say the one ultimate consequence is ' the lights will go out '
