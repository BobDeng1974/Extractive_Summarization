by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 teenager who wanted to raise awareness about cerebral palsy by walking 40 miles with his younger brother strapped to his back battled heat , rain , fatigue and more to finish the trek sunday			1
@entity12 , 14 , had been planning for weeks to pull off the walk , hoping to put a face on the muscular disorder that prevents his 7 - year - old sibling , @entity16 , from being able to walk without help			1
but all his organizing could n't prepare him for the conditions he faced as he packed the 50 - pound boy over two days			0
he even thought about giving up along the way			0
' @entity16 's legs - the chafing was getting pretty bad			1
we did have to consider stopping			0
it was at about the 30 - mile point			2
' a phone call changed all that			0
@entity12 reached out to a friend , who said a prayer for the brothers			1
that , combined with some rest and a change in how @entity16 was positioned on his brother 's back , helped the boys make it the final 10 miles			1
it may have taken a bit longer than they anticipated , but the @entity55 and more than a dozen of their family members and friends strolled up a winding road sunday toward the @entity60 's wrestling center			2
at the top of the hill , @entity12 lifted up @entity16 so he could touch a ' @entity64 ' banner erected for them near the walk 's endpoint			1
the move was met with thunderous applause and cheers from those who had gathered to see the boys finish the trek			2
tough : the boy 's almost had to stop because of chafing on @entity16 's legs caused by the way he was situated on his brother 's back , but the tough 7 - year - old powered through it asked how he felt , @entity16 replied simply : ' tired			1
' @entity12 said he was ' more tired than i think i 've ever been			1
my legs are pretty sore			0
but we pushed through it			0
' more than 30 hours earlier , @entity12 , with @entity16 securely strapped to his back , left the parking lot of @entity87 in @entity88 near the @entity90 border			1
just before their saturday morning departure , well - wishers packed the gym for a send - off and the school band performed			0
the boys ' parents and two other siblings accompanied them on the walk			2
a caravan of cars and other walkers also joined in			0
the goal of the walk , called the @entity27 , was to raise awareness about cerebral palsy and hopefully inspire new ideas for mobility aides and medical procedures			1
@entity16 typically uses a walker , braces or a power chair to get around			2
touching : @entity12 says he walked so far with his brother on his back to show @entity16 how much he appreciated him being there for him finished ! after a grueling 40 miles on his brother 's back , @entity16 celebrates with friends and family @entity12 , a 155 - pound wrestler , said he trained for the trek by lifting weights and staying active			1
and by checking the weather forecast			0
saturday was warm and sunny , but sunday was cool and rainy			0
the boys were prepared , though , and packed a variety of outerwear			0
by the time sunday afternoon arrived , the rain had subsided and they completed their triumphant march into @entity128 under sunny skies			0
for @entity12 , the walk was about doing something for his brother			1
' i ca n't even describe to you how special ( @entity16 ) is to me			2
i ca n't put it into words , ' the teen said			0
he 's always there for me			0
i really just wanted to give back to him in some way			1
