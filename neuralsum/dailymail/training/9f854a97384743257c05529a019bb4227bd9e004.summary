eating instant noodles two or three times a week increased the risk of heart disease and stroke from a cheap student staple to a pricey bowl of broth , noodle dishes are soaring in popularity			1
but they could also wreak havoc with your health , a new study warns			0
@entity16 scientists found people who ate noodle dishes two to three times a week - including the @entity21 noodle soup dish ramen - had an increased risk of developing cardiometabolic syndrome			1
this , in turn , raises a person â€™s likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions , such as diabetes and stroke			1
the findings , published in @entity33 , could shed new light on the risks of a worldwide dietary habit , said lead study author @entity37			0
dr @entity37 , who led the study on behalf of the @entity39 and @entity40 , in @entity41 , said instant noodles and ramen appeared to be particularly damaging to women 's health			1
because ramen consumption is relatively high among @entity48 populations , the research focused primarily on @entity49 , which has the highest instant noodle consumption person in the world			2
in recent years , @entity49 have experienced a rapid increase in health problems , specifically heart disease , and a growing number of overweight adults , said dr @entity37			1
he decided to investigate the connection between noodle consumption and poor health			2
noodles , like many processed foods , are high in salt - and a diet high in the mineral can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke			1
and earlier this year , @entity68 , a gastrointestinal specialist from the @entity69 in @entity70 found the body struggles to digest dried , ramen noodles			2
he used a tiny camera to look at the digestive activity of instant ramen noodles in comparison to the digestion of fresh ones			2
many instant ramen noodles , he said , contain the chemical tertiary - butyl hydroquinone ( @entity81 ) , a food additive that is a bi-product of butane , used in the petroleum industry			2
after the experiment , he said : ' the most striking thing about our experiment when you looked at a time interval , say in one or two hours , [ was that ] processed ramen noodles were less broken down than homemade ramen noodles			0
' the findings even apply to the @entity21 noodle soup dish ramen - with women most at risk of health problems in the new study , dr @entity37 found women in particular were more likely to suffer health problems from slurping bowls of noodles			1
this , he says , can be attributed to biological differences - such as sex hormones and metabolism - between men and women			0
@entity109 is a @entity21 noodle soup dish			0
it consists of @entity113 - style wheat noodles served in a meat - or fish - based broth , often flavoured with soy sauce or miso , and uses toppings such as sliced pork , dried seaweed , kamaboko , and green onions			0
however it may be because women are more likely to accurately report what they ate each day , he adds.another potential factor in the gender differences is a chemical called @entity128 ( @entity128 ) - used to package noodles in @entity132 containers			1
studies have shown that @entity128 interferes with the way hormones send messages through the body , specifically oestrogen , said dr @entity37			0
' this research is significant since many people are consuming instant noodles without knowing possible health risks , ' he added			0
' my hope is that this study can lay a foundation for future research about the health effects of instant noodle consumption			0

noodle dishes increased the risk of developing cardiometabolic syndrome
this in turn raises risk of heart disease , diabetes and stroke
risk of conditions seen in those eating noodles two or three times a week
women are particularly at risk , say the @entity16 researchers
