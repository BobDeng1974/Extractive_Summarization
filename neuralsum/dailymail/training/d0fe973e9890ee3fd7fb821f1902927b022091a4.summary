an academy in south @entity1 has banned popular slang words used by pupils in an effort to improve standards of @entity6			1
no longer will words and phrases such as ' you woz ' , ' bare ' and ' innit ' be tolerated in the corridors of @entity11 in @entity12 , one of 27 academies and free cchools in and around @entity1 sponsored by the @entity16			1
the school has put up signs with a list of ' banned words ' - including ' extra ' , ' innit ' and ' like ' , as well as beginning sentences with ' basically ' or ending them with ' yeah '			1
crackdown : no longer will words and phrases such as ' you woz ' , ' bare ' and ' innit ' be tolerated in the corridors of @entity11 in @entity12 @entity27 mp for @entity29 @entity28 defended the move , only lamenting that ' sup blood ' was not included			1
he said : ' i think this is a very good idea			2
speaking slang is fine in a social setting but a school should be a professional , educational environment and if part of that means banning slang then that ’s fine by me			1
' too often i see young people going into job interviews or writing cover letters without being able to use correct @entity6			2
any attempts to change that should be encouraged			2
' not many employers would tolerate their staff using words like " innit " when speaking to customers or clients , so the school is right to try to discourage the use of this language in classrooms			2
@entity28 has reported that an academy in @entity1 has banned some slang words , such as ' bare ' and ' extra ' ' given the huge levels of youth unemployment we are experiencing under the current government , it is more important than ever that schools do what they can to prepare students for working life , and teaching good communication skills is a vital part of that			1
' i think it is fairly obvious to most people that anyone who goes into a job interview with a good grasp of the @entity6 language will have an automatic advantage over someone that does n’t			2
' the issue here is n’t about slang itself , but about the context it is used in			1
language is an important part of any culture , and young people will always have their own slang			1
' but young people need versatility ; using slang is fine in some situations , but the ability to also speak good @entity6 is absolutely crucial in any workplace , and it is something that every school should be teaching its students			1
' ' those saying this is an attack on culture are completely missing that point : no one is saying slang is bad , but simply that it should n’t be the only way that one is capable of communicating			1
' but the move was criticised by some online observers			1
science blogger and academic @entity106 tweeted : ' @entity107 limited approach to language , innit ' , while @entity110 said : ' wow			2
' but children 's book illustrator @entity113 tweeted : ' @entity115 to teach kids to speak appropriately in formal contexts			2

they did n't get the job			0
' @entity11 was not available for comment tonight			1
mr @entity28 said : ' i think it is fairly obvious to most people that anyone who goes into a job interview with a good grasp of the @entity6 language will have an automatic advantage over someone that does n't ' the @entity11 in @entity12 , where the ban has been implemented last year an academy in @entity148 banned slang and ' text talk ' over fears pupils ' command of @entity6 would adversely affect them in job interviews			1
@entity155 , deputy chief executive of the city 's @entity156 , which runs the city 's @entity158 , said : ' what we want to make sure of is that they are confident in using standard @entity6			0
slang does n't really give the right impression of the person			1
' youngsters going to interviews for their first job need to make a good impression so that employers have confidence in them			0
' it 's not difficult to get youngster out of the habit of using slang			1
' @entity176 - short for ' because '			0
