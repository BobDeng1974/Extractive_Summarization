but in his new autobiography , the recently married , father - of - two , said his mother simply replied that although it may be a phase , it would not make any difference in how much his parents loved him			1
he writes : ' and she sees that even though you date some really nice girls through your high school years , it 's the cute new boy in your class or on set who really gets under your skin and thrills you and spurs your imagination			0
in the book , which offers fans the chance to take their own path while recounting moments of his life , @entity0 - who found fame aged 16 on 80s tv hit , @entity32 , @entity53 - acknowledges that throughout the show 's run his ' actual sexual identity at this time is a mystery , even to you			1
' and he admits that it took years for him to come to terms with his sexuality , labeling himself bisexual before telling his parents he was gay			1
his mother , he says , was accepting , while his dad @entity63 took a while to come to terms with news			0
still , he says : ' you 've come a long way from the anonymous skulker trolling the @entity70 chat rooms			2
' and he declares : ' you are gay			2
you know that you are ; you like that you are ; you ’re proud that you are			0
and now you are totally gay and totally in love , and it ’s wonderful ’			2

@entity40 ' kiss makes you gay			1
' struggling to come to terms with his sexuality , the entertainer had his first gay liaison with a co-star called @entity144 , with whom he appeared in a 1997 production of the musical rent			0
he says : ' on the plus side , you did have an orgasm ' , as he calls their meetings ' a tentative first step towards a new life '			0
