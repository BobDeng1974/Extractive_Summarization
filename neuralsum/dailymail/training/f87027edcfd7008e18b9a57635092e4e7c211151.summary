by @entity0 soil has been frozen to the bottom of the @entity4 for 2.7 million years , a study reveals			0
a piece of the @entity7 ice core is pictured scientists have discovered an ancient ' green ' tundra landscape preserved below approximately two miles ( 3.2km ) of ice			1
the evidence suggests that the @entity4 has existed much longer than previously thought and has survived a number of periods of global warming			1
‘ we found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years , ’ said @entity16 geologist @entity15			1
scientists are particularly interested in @entity4 ’s ice sheet as it is the second largest in the world			1
its future stability could have an enormous impact on how fast and high global sea levels rise from climate change			1
the sheet 's 656,000 square miles ( 1,055,000km ) of ice could raise the global sea levels 23ft ( 7 metres ) if they were to melt			1
@entity34 a co-author on the study from the @entity37 and the @entity38 , @entity38 , said : ‘ the ancient soil under the @entity4 ice sheet helps to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change			1
' the discovery suggests that even during the warmest periods since the vast ice sheet formed , the centre of @entity4 remained stable			1
dr @entity15 said : ‘ it ’s likely that it did not fully melt at any time , which allowed the tundra landscape to be locked away under the ice for millions of years			0
surprise ! scientists were stunned to discover an ancient tundra landscape frozen under two miles of ice in @entity4 ( pictured )			1
it has been there for three million years and could lead scientists to reconsider how stable @entity4 's ice is the @entity4 is a vast body of ice covering 656,000 square miles ( 1,055,000km ) of @entity4 - approximately 80 per cent of the country 's surface			2
it is the second largest ice body in the world after the @entity66 and is around the same size as @entity68			2
the thickness of the ice is usually more than one mile ( 2km )			0
some climate scientists argue that the ice is nearing a ' tipping point ' where it could all melt in the next 2,000 years			0
if the entire 684,000 cubic miles ( 2,850,000 cubic km ) of ice did melt , it would lead to a rise in global sea levels of 23ft ( 7metres )			2
the new study suggests that the @entity4 has been around much longer than previously thought and that it was covered in green tundra around three millions years ago			2
it is based on the examination of an ice core called @entity7 2 , which was taken in 1993			2
@entity16 graduate student @entity83 , explained : ‘ the traditional knowledge about glaciers is that they are very powerful agents of erosion and can effectively strip a landscape clean			0
' [ instead ] we demonstrate that the @entity4 is not acting as an agent of erosion ; in fact , at its centre , it has performed incredibly little erosion since its inception almost three million years ago			0
’ dr @entity15 described the ice sheet as a refrigerator that has preserved the landscape			2
the scientists found the tundra by taking a fresh look at 17 ‘ dirty ice ’ samples from the deepest 40ft of the 10,019ft @entity7 ice core extracted in 1993			1
they extracted a rare form of the element beryllium - an isotope called @entity108 – which was formed by cosmic rays and trapped in the soil and rock			0
the longer soil is exposed at @entity118 ’s surface , the more beryllium - 10 it accumulates and measuring how much is soil or rock allows geologists to date the material			0
scientists are concerned about ice from the @entity4 melting because it could raise global sea levels significantly			1
these images show the extent of surface melt in july 2012 ( from left to right ) the researchers expected to only find soil from eroded rocks , but instead discovered the silt had very high concentrations of the isotope , which they measured on a particle accelerator at @entity136			0
@entity137 who analysed the beryllium data , said : ‘ on a global basis , we only find these sorts of beryllium concentrations in soils that have developed over hundreds of thousands to millions of years			0
’ the research shows that the soil has been stable and exposed at the surface for somewhere between 200,000 and one million years before it was covered with ice			2
the team also measured nitrogen and carbon that could have been left by plant material in the core sample			0
the fact that measurable amounts of organic material were found in the silty ice suggests that the pre-glacial landscape may have been partially forested tundra			0
dr @entity34 said : ‘ @entity4 really was green ! however , it was millions of years ago			0
‘ @entity4 looked like the green @entity68 tundra , before it was covered by the second largest body of ice on @entity118			1

@entity16 researchers analysed soil to prove the presence of an ancient tundra two miles ( 3.2km ) below the @entity4
@entity4 looked like the green @entity68 tundra , before it was covered by the second largest body of ice on @entity118 , the experts said
evidence suggests the sheet is older - and more stable - than thought and has survived a number of periods of global warming
the future stability of the ice sheet could have a huge impact on sea levels
scientists found the landscape by taking a look at 17 ‘ dirty ice ’ samples from the @entity7 ice core extracted from @entity189 , @entity4 in 1993
