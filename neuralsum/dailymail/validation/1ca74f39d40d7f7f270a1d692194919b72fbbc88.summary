our pillar - box red , open - top @entity2 would fail its @entity3 abysmally			2
the suspension has gone ; only the driver 's door opens from the inside and there does n't even seem to be a speedometer			1
but it 's still going and it 's a lot of fun			2
a bit like @entity13 , in fact			1
everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following president @entity20 's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years			1
a place with a past and a future : @entity24 is an evocative city , rich in @entity26 colonial architecture for sure , change is needed in a country where almost everyone is denied access to the internet , where most people take home around $ 20 a month , where there is still rationing and where not believing in the ' @entity35 ' still makes you an enemy of the state			0
but turning round this old tanker is going to take decades , not years			0
the real reason to go now is because for all their travails , the @entity13 people are remarkably kind , honest and polite - and @entity24 is like nowhere else on @entity43			1
everywhere we go , there is a healthy scepticism about the @entity47 years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property			1
we 're in the open - top @entity2 ( not driving it ) on the way to @entity55 's house , 20 minutes from @entity24			1
we 've already downed a daiquiri at @entity57 , where a statue of the great man occupies the end of the bar , and we 've chased that up with a mojito at @entity64 , another of his hang - outs near the sublime @entity68			0
before the day is done , we 'll sink more at @entity69 in the fishing village of @entity71 , the inspiration for @entity73 , which helped @entity55 win the @entity74 in 1954			1
at the wheel : despite various mechanical troubles , @entity76 managed to take to the road in @entity13 he bought @entity79 in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years			1
it 's pretty much how he left it			2
bullfighting scenes and stuffed animals hang from the walls , his typewriter sits on the desk and rum competes for space with his books			0
ask to see @entity91 and take along a translator			0
she has looked after the house for more than 20 years			0
when i ask her what @entity55 would make of @entity13 today , her eyes fill with tears			1
' i do n't know , ' she says , ' but @entity55 loved @entity13			1
' back in @entity24 , our guide takes us to the @entity101 , where @entity102 , naturally , is the star of the show - but @entity104 has a walk - on part in the rogue 's gallery with the caption : ' thank you cretin for helping us make socialism irrevocable			2
' full of character : @entity112 is a touristy - but charming - colonial town three hours south - east of @entity24 what knocks us back is the beauty of the dilapidated grand houses , palaces and squares			0
it makes you wonder why on earth the @entity121 gave @entity13 back to @entity26 in 1763 in return for @entity124			1
@entity125 or @entity24 ? no contest			0
a joke that still does the rounds is that the revolution failed on three fronts : breakfast , lunch and dinner			0
and it 's no laughing matter			2
there 's only so much dry fish with black beans on the side that a man in @entity24 can take			2
our best dinner is at @entity142 , where @entity102 's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant			1
he 's an engaging fellow and the walls are hung with black - and - white photos of him and his former boss			2
you absolutely have to eat at @entity150 , housed on the third floor of a glorious , crumbling building			2
the food is as dull as anywhere else , but the experience is exquisite : antique wine glasses , nicotine - stained walls , little balconies with room for one table each			0
there 's music everywhere in @entity24 , of course			2
what takes us by surprise is the art. we have a tour of two studios where @entity102 is caricatured as a false @entity170 and a sex maniac			0
clutter and colour : @entity13 's half - century on a limb has preserved @entity24 in a dilapidated but beautiful state there are n't many decent hotels in the capital			1
we pick the pricey @entity180 opposite the vast @entity182 building ( a metre higher than @entity183 , of which it is a near - perfect replica ) because it has a pool on the roof			0
on the way to @entity112 , a colonial town three to four hours away , we call in at the @entity188 and watch a 20 - minute propaganda film about the failed @entity191 invasion , then spend a couple of hours in @entity193 , which , frankly , leaves us cold , despite the 30 degree temperatures			1
@entity112 is charming , but touristy			0
two nights here ( we stay at the excellent @entity197 ) are ample			0
it was once prosperous thanks to sugar mills			0
today , its cobbled streets house restaurants and gift shops			0
two courses and a bottle of drinkable wine can be had for £ 20 a head			0
one of @entity13 's best beaches , @entity209 , is eight miles away			1
we hire bikes and pedal off into the sunset , then persuade a local to bring us back in his rusting banger , bikes in the boot			0
hitting the right notes : you can find - as @entity76 did - music and art in many corners of @entity13 on the way back to @entity24 we stop briefly in @entity223 , where the remains of @entity225 , the poster boy of the revolution , are housed in a grand memorial building			1
we 've done our bit with respect to @entity13 's past and return to @entity24 , where the future is on everyone 's lips			1
our last night is in a private apartment on the top floor of a building in the residential @entity239 district			0
after dinner , there 's just time to take a horse and cart back to the old town , now a world heritage site			2
what is going to happen to @entity13 ? no one knows			1
life , hopefully , will be better for long - suffering @entity13 , but it might not be quite such a potent cocktail for the rest of us			1
the @entity254 ( 020 3051 8098 , www.theultimatetravelcompany.co.uk ) offers seven - night breaks in @entity13 from £ 3,425 per person on a bed - and - breakfast basis , including four days in @entity24 , three nights in @entity112 and a final night in @entity24 at the @entity259			1
includes guided sightseeing , visas , return @entity264 flights and private transfers .			0

@entity13 is expecting an *influx* of @entity191 tourists following the lifting of sanctions
writer @entity55 loved @entity13 , and bought @entity79 in 1940
eat at @entity142 , where @entity47 's ex-chef has opened a restaurant
