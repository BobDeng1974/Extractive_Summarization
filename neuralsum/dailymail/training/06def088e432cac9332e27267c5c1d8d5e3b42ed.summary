last saturday , a smiling and confident @entity16 , 12 , returned home to @entity4 after undergoing ten surgeries to reconstruct her face			1
@entity12 , 12 , has regained her confidence and smile after @entity23 doctor dr. @entity22 carried out a series of operations to help rebuild her face over the past year she is the first child to have had her life dramatically changed by the @entity27 , a charity dedicated to helping children with facial deformities deemed virtually ‘ untreatable ’			1
it was setup by dr. @entity22 , an orthodontist on the cleft palate team at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity23			2
after making numerous mission trips to provide free surgeries to repair cleft palates or other facial deformities in children around the world , he wanted to do more to help those children with the most severe deformities			2
‘ on every mission i ’ve gone on there ’s always been one or two kids turned away because they are too severe to be able to treat and that ’s always bothered me , ’ @entity22 told @entity43			0
when she younger , @entity12 's face was ravaged by a rare flesh - eating bacteria that made it difficult for her to speak , eat and even breathe @entity16 was just 3 - years - old when she was diagnosed with @entity51			1
the flesh - eating bacteria develops in the mouth and ravages the faces of its victims by destroying the soft and bone tissues of the face			1
‘ @entity51 attacked her face , ate through her skin , through her upper jaw , destroyed her nose and destroyed her palate … that ’s the medical part , ’ said @entity22			2
‘ the social part is she was basically a recluse , she had no friends , she did n’t go to school			0
’ she first came to the attention of dr. @entity22 in 2010 , but it took three years of fundraising and navigating bureaucratic barriers before @entity16 finally arrived in the @entity7 for treatment last june			2
at first she was shy and afraid , and unwilling to show her face in public or look people in the eye			0
‘ we had to reconstruct a nose , an upper lip and a palate – and that was one big cavity , one big hole , ’ dr. @entity76 , chief of the plastic and reconstructive surgery division at @entity33 , told @entity79			0
dr. @entity22 , an orthodontist on the cleft palate team at @entity33 founded the @entity27 for kids to help children with facial deformities deemed ' untreatable ' before the operations , @entity16 was basically a recluse , who had no friends and did n't go to school as @entity16 ’s appearance began to improve , her doctors and host family noticed a marked improvement in both her health and self - esteem			1
she even grew six inches and learned to speak @entity102			0
' here everyone is welcoming her , telling her she is beautiful , i think that all really played a part of getting her to come out of her shell , ' said @entity109 , who hosted @entity16 in her home for three months			0
@entity16 had her tenth major surgery - to create a nose - in april and then on may 31 she flew back to @entity4			2
she is now able to breathe normally , speak more clearly and eat without spilling food and drink from her mouth			0
her risk for future infections has also decreased significantly now that the open cavity in her face has been closed			0
she may need a few corrective procedures to minimize scarring in the future			0
‘ no words can adequately express how i feel			0
you have not only taught me your language , and fixed my face , you have taught me how it feels to be taken care of and unconditionally loved			1
goodbye - for now , ’ she told dr. @entity22 before leaving			1
@entity16 will be enrolled in a private boarding school in @entity4 , where she will receive an education , a bed to sleep in and three meals per day – all funded by the @entity27			2
‘ she ’s touched our lives and exposed us to what exists elsewhere and instilled this sense of gratitude in those of us that have been involved with her , ’ said dr. @entity22			0
' she ’s been an inspiration to us and really a gift , she ’s enriched our lives			0
' with @entity16 ’s journey almost at an end , dr. @entity22 is in the process of screening more children to bring to the @entity7 for similar reconstructive surgeries			1
' you showed me unconditional love ' : saline at the airport on saturday with her @entity7 friends including dr. @entity22 and @entity109 , far right , who hosted @entity16 in her home for three months			1

when @entity12 was three she contracted @entity51 , the flesh - eating bacteria , through infected drinking water in her remote @entity4 village
the bacteria ravaged her face and made it difficult for her to speak , eat and even breathe
@entity23 doctor dr. @entity22 founded the @entity172 charity to help children with ' untreatable ' facial deformities
in the last year @entity16 has undergone ten operations to rebuild her face
on saturday she returned home to @entity4 a smiling and confident 12 - year - old
' you have taught me how it feels to be taken care of and unconditionally loved , ' she told dr. @entity22 before she left
