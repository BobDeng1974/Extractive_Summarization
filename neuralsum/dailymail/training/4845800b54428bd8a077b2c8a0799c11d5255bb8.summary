by @entity0 published : 00:53 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 29 march 2013 take aim : former tucson mayoral candidate @entity2 supports a program that will give free shotguns to residents of high - crime areas of @entity7 a program to hand out weapons in high - crime areas in the same town where @entity12 and 18 others were shot has caused sharp criticism from gun control advocates			1
the @entity16 was backed by former @entity7 , @entity17 mayoral candidate @entity2 , a @entity18 , who said that he wants to have at least 36 people in these neighborhoods armed with shotguns and trained in the next two months			1
it is controversial in no small part because @entity7 is the city where @entity25 @entity12 was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting spree that left six people , including a nine - year - old girl , dead			1
the @entity18 told @entity29 that all of the reviews he ’s heard of the program have been positive , and that he ’s raised more than $ 12,000 already			0
he ’s offering the single - shot shotguns to anyone who lives in mid-to - high - risk neighborhoods and can pass a background check , and is hoping to focus on high - crime areas like @entity38 , @entity39 , and the @entity41 area , which he said is ‘ rampant ’ with break - ins			1
the guns themselves cost around $ 200 , while training , ammunition , and cleaning supplies would run the cost up to around $ 350 per person , per gun			0
to arms : the @entity53 seeks to provide free single - shot shotguns to those who pass background checks and receive training ‘ right now , the criminal element is winning , ’ he said , according to the @entity58			2
but mr @entity2 ’s views are deeply unpopular with state politicians			2
‘ to suggest that giving away … loaded shotguns in high - crime areas will make anybody safer is pure idiocy , ’ councilman @entity62 said , according to the @entity58			1
‘ ( the @entity18 ) is totally out of touch with the values of this city			0
’ the councilman said that background checks would do little to keep these weapons out of the wrong hands , and would contribute to violence in crime - ravaged areas			2
councilwoman @entity75 agreed , saying that mr @entity2 ’s assessment of some of @entity7 ’s neighborhoods is ‘ stereotyping			1
’ she told @entity80 : ‘ @entity2 … is reckless in promoting such a ridiculous idea			0
if he wants to hand out guns to people , why does n’t he hand them out around the neighborhood ? ’ in remembrance : former congresswoman @entity12 and her husband @entity86 pictured earlier this month at the @entity7 shooting site memorial : days after the 2011 shooting , a makeshift memorial was set up to honor the six people , including a nine - year - old girl , who were shot dead the @entity16 was founded by @entity92 , a @entity93 graduate student , who defends the initiative			1
‘ we ’re not just tossing a bunch of shotguns into a community and walking away , ’ he said			0
‘ what we ’re doing is finding residents who are interested in protecting themselves			0
’ he added that there are plans to expand the project to other cities , including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109			0
two years ago , then rep. @entity12 was making an appearance at a @entity111 for a meet - and - greet event when gunman @entity113 opened fire on the event			2

first responders : @entity119 is seen on a stretcher on january 8 , 2011 , moments after she was shot in the head rep. @entity12 was shot at point - blank range in the head , but miraculously survived the shooting			1
after two years of intensive care and physical therapy , the former congresswoman still struggles with speech and movement			0
she and her husband , retired astronaut @entity86 , have launched an initiative called the @entity134 , demanding harsher gun control laws in the wake of other mass shootings such as last summer ’s @entity139 theater shooting and december ’s @entity141 massacre			0
according to neighborhoodscout.com , @entity7 has 3,492 violent crimes every year , with nearly 30,000 property crimes , or around 6.64 crimes per 1,000 residents			0
@entity147 professor @entity146 , who teaches criminology , told the @entity58 that study after study has shown that guns have only succeeded in increasing crimes			0
‘ there is no credible evidence at all that providing a high - crime area with the instruments to facilitate more crime is going to have any net social benefits , ’ he said			1
crime and punishment : certain areas of @entity7 have alarmingly high crime rates , but some experts say that gun ownership will not solve that			1
