by @entity0 a previously unseen letter by @entity2 has revealed the genius was once corrected - by a 23 - year - old student			1
@entity5 was studying for a master ’s degree in physics when he wrote to @entity2 to point out that an equation in one of his published papers was actually wrong			1
the eminent @entity13 physicist initially politely dismissed the claim , replying to the young student with a long - winded and mathematical defence of his work			1
in a previously unseen letter , @entity2 , pictured right , admitted to @entity5 , pictured left , that he had made a mistake he concluded ‘ i will now show that equation is really , really not the equation you specified ’ before signing off ' yours respectfully , @entity2 '			1
but two weeks later @entity5 received a second letter from @entity2 in which he sensationally conceded he had made a mistake			1
the second letter , written by @entity2 on september 13 , 1938 , reads : ' shortly after i wrote you , i noticed that the error was on my side ... ' ... the transformation required is exactly that of a tensor in the @entity33			1
' therefore , your transformation equation is correct , mine wrong			0
i do n’t have my earlier work available			0
but it sure seems that i have made the same mistake there			0
' this will make my assertions about the shape of the first approximation inaccurate			0
' the correspondence related to @entity2 ’s work on a unified theory of @entity47 - a study of gravitation and electromagnetic fields			2
@entity2 had spent years developing the theory but had abandoned his work in 1931 because he had struggled to explain the link between the two fields			0
the correspondence related to @entity2 's work on a unified theory of @entity47 - a study of gravitation and electromagnetic fields			2
@entity2 's two letters , in @entity13 , plus @entity5 's original letter are now tipped to fetch £ 50,000 at auction at the age of 23 , @entity5 , pictured , wrote to @entity2 to question him about a point regarding his first approximation equation in his relativity theory but the revelation of his mistake , pointed out by @entity67 student mr @entity5 , made him revisit the theory			1
mr @entity5 went on to become an acclaimed physicist in his own right , lecturing at @entity71 and @entity73 universities and publishing more than 100 papers			2
he died in 2006 aged 91 and the letters passed to his family , who are now selling them			0
@entity2 ’s two letters , written in @entity13 , and @entity5 ’s original letter are now tipped to fetch £ 50,000 at auction			1
@entity80 , auctioneer at @entity82 in @entity83 , said : ' these letters are remarkable because in them @entity2 humbly admits to a 23 - year - old physics student that he was wrong			1
@entity5 was born in the @entity67 in 1915 and went on to become an applied mathematician			0
it was in 1938 that @entity5 , as a 23 - year - old working on his master ’s degree in mathematics and applied sciences at @entity71 , wrote to @entity2 with what he believed were corrections to @entity2 's unified field theory equations			1
@entity5 completed his masters and went on to become an acclaimed physicist in his own right , lecturing at @entity71 and @entity73 universities and publishing more than 100 papers			2
in 1957 as a 42 - year - old he wrote ' toward a @entity99 to the @entity100 ' outlining a theory of form development at the cellular level			1
he died in 2006 aged 91 and the letters passed to his family , who are now selling them			0
' it goes to show that despite being one of the greatest thinkers of all time @entity2 was still just human and he made mistakes from time to time			2
' what is incredible is that not only did he reply to @entity5 ’s initial letter , he then thought about it and sent him another letter accepting his mistake			2
' the tone of the second letter is not of annoyance but one of excitement that @entity5 has given him a lead to pursuing his unified field theory , something he had worked on since his theory of relativity breakthrough			0
' he was grateful to anything that might put him back on the right track			0
' we expect there to be a huge amount of interest worldwide in the sale of these letters			0
' the auction will take place on friday .			0

@entity5 wrote to @entity2 telling him he had made a mistake
the physicist initially dismissed the student 's letter with long - winded reply
but @entity2 wrote to the 23 - year - old again conceding he had made an error
the correspondence is expected to fetch £ 50,000 at auction this week
