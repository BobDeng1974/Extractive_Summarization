where it all began : the @entity63 started their burger odyssey at @entity65 in @entity10 back in oct 2010 the list included one joint for each state , plus the @entity69 , each recommended by a local foodie			2

‘ i ’ve always said the best burger is the last one i ate			0
but i ’ll be absolutely honest with you , that was the best one ever , ’ said @entity6			2
according to @entity6 the whole journey was about more than just trying out a lot of different types of burgers			1
‘ it ’s really the people along the way that made it so much fun and a few who were n’t that charming , ’ @entity102 told @entity47			0
‘ but our country is so wonderful , whether it ’s @entity120 or downtown @entity121 , they all have their own flavor			0
