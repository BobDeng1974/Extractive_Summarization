by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:00 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 08:46 est , 17 january 2013 mps who demanded pay rises of up to 32 per cent were today branded ‘ potty ’ by @entity4			1
the deputy prime minister said it ‘ beggars belief ’ that mps surveyed by the commons expenses watchdog had said they should be earning tens of thousands of pounds more			2
a survey last week revealed that 69 per cent believe they are ‘ underpaid ’ following the introduction of a new expenses regime that forces them to provide receipts for all claims			1
@entity4 said mps were wrong to demand vast pay rises when public sector workers were seeing salaries increase by just one per cent the studies were commissioned by the @entity22 , which is reviewing whether @entity17 ’ pay should be changed from its current level of £ 65,738			1
on average , @entity25 said their salary should be £ 96,740 , while @entity27 thought the right amount was £ 78,361 and @entity29 £ 77,322			0
mr @entity4 said : ‘ it just beggars belief apparently that some mps have anonymously said they deserve a pay increase			1
’ challenged over mps pay on his weekly radio phone - in , he added : ‘ they are living on a different planet to think that you can say to teachers and nurses and doctors “ you ’re only going to get a one per cent increase in your pay for the next several years but we deserve a [ 32 per cent ] increase ”			1
‘ i think it ’s potty and it ’s not going to happen , certainly if i ’ve got anything to do with it			0
’ @entity48 conducted online interviews with 100 mps on @entity52 's behalf , and weighted the results slightly to represent the @entity54 by party , gender , year elected , and geography			0
conservatives were the most likely to believe they were underpaid , with 47 per cent saying that was the case			0
some 39 per cent of @entity29 members and 9 per cent of @entity27 held the same view			0
one mp said they should be paid £ 40,000 or less			0
some 5 per cent said £ 60 - 65,000 was fair , and 17 % went for £ 65 - £ 70,000			2
it was mr @entity4 's second week as a talk show host , appearing alongside @entity67 presenter @entity66 to answer questions from callers on @entity67 mr @entity4 said he hoped @entity52 would do ‘ the sensible thing ’ and restrain pay , taking aim at the mps who used anonymity to demand bigger salaries , he added : ‘ i flatly and totally disagree with it			1
i do n’t know who put their names to this			0
‘ whoever did needs to think again and also needs to think about what signal it sends out to the constituents of mps who are being asked to have real restraint and limits on how fast their own pay increases			2
