actively searching for directions , weather reports or even what to have for dinner is so last year			0
the future lies in apps that can read your mind and offer up this information automatically , with @entity9 leading the way with its @entity12 app. technically @entity12 does n’t read a user ’s mind , but it is capable of predicting what they will do next , before offering relevant help and information at each step without ever being asked			1
@entity22 's ¿ machine learning ¿ capabilities could provide @entity12 ( pictured ) with added context and faster response times , across different devices			1
the acquistion was confirmed in a blog post on wednesday , but details of the deal have not been revealed the software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction			1
in the case of personal - assistant apps , the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is , or should be			1
it combines this with location data , taken from the phone or tablet ’s gps unit , as well as posts on social networks , email information and more			1
it will then present the user with the help it thinks they need			0
for example , if a calendar on an @entity58 phone contains a diary invite , @entity12 will create a reminder			1
it will then check to see whether the user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder , or work out how long it will take them to get there based on current traffic			0
elsewhere , as users pass bus stops , prediction apps can show bus timetables , show the latest deals as they enter a supermarket , or open a digital boarding pass as they approach an airport			2
it does this by using what ’s called ‘ predictive analysis ’			1
predictive analysis is n’t a new concept ; financial services have used it for years to work out a person ’s credit score and how likely they are pay back a loan , for example			0
yet @entity12 , along with other intelligent personal assistant apps including @entity92 and @entity93 , uses this technology to predict how everyday smartphone owners are going to behave			1

in the case of these personal - assistant apps , the software scans calendar entries to work out where a user is , or should be			1
it combines this with location data , taken from the phone or tablet ’s gps unit , as well as posts on social networks , email information and more			1

other prediction apps including @entity92 , pictured , can show bus timetables as as users pass a bus stop , for example			2
it can show the latest deals as they enter a supermarket , or open a digital boarding pass as they approach an airport a card could also be created to show what the weather is like where they are going and even advise taking an umbrella			0

@entity156 's team is already working to make @entity9 more human and recent updates mean the software can now understand context and present only relevant information like a human would the latest updates to @entity12 are an extension of changes the tech giant recently made to its search algorithm			1
now when you search @entity9 it no longer just searches for individual keywords ; it can now respond to questions and statements in the same way a human might , by looking at the whole query - even if it does n't have an exact answer			2
for example , asking @entity9 ' tell me about impressionist artists ' will show a list of artists but also now let you click to learn about the impressionist movement , browse individual artwork , or switch to abstract artists using filters			2
called @entity187 , the company claims it ’s ' the most significant algorithm change ' in years and will affect 90 per cent of searches			0
users can now ask @entity9 to compile playlists , compare items or find out facts about landmarks and the search giant will create context for each one			1
for example , if searching for information about @entity200 , the searcher only needs to say ' @entity200 ' once ; @entity9 will know that if someone asks for trivia about the landmark , before asking for directions , that both questions relate to the same thing			2
when used with @entity12 , a card will show these directions automatically as soon as they search for the landmark , as long as they are within relatively close distance			2
back in 2012 , researchers from @entity214 created software that could successfully predict a person ’s future locations with an error margin of just 60ft			0
a screenshot from the @entity221 mapping software			0
researchers from @entity223 and @entity9 can predict where a person will be years from now using this system			1
the program tracks a person using gps and learns their routine			0
it then uses this information to accurately plot their future locations while mobile phone networks can already track where a handset is in ' real time ' , the scientists developed the algorithm to forecast our future movements			0
they compared data from one individual and their closest social network to predict a person ’s future location based on places and areas visited in the past and the frequency of contact between those studied			1
earlier this year , researchers from @entity223 and @entity9 similarly developed software called @entity255 out that can learn a person ’s routine by tracking them using gps			0
it then uses this information to accurately guess their future locations and will adapts its predictions even if someone changes their job , relationship or moves house			0
and as every aspect of our lives are tracked and monitored , the software is set to become even more advanced .			0

@entity9 now uses ‘ predictive *analytics* ’ to guess what its users want
it combines location data with calendar entries , emails and more to predict what a user will do next
app then works out what help they need and offers it without being asked
@entity12 is just one of many apps using these predictive algorithms
