by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 20:47 est , 21 february 2013 two thirds of jurors do not understand a judge ’s legal direction , research has revealed			1
as lawyers and judges tried to defend the jury system in the aftermath of the collapse of the trial of @entity14 ’s ex-wife @entity13 , the study found that jurors in that case were not alone in failing to grasp their brief			1
the two - year analysis of trial by jury also found that jurors frequently used the internet to research trials , despite warnings not to do so because of the risk of miscarriages of justice			1
scrutiny : the collapse of the trial of @entity13 , left , ex-wife of former cabinet minister @entity14 , right , has raised questions about the strength of the jury system the researchers suggested that jurors should be given written cards which clearly explained their responsibilities throughout the trial process			1
former @entity38 , @entity39 , called for further research into the system of trial by jury , including greater study of jurors ’ deliberations			1
the jurors in the @entity13 trial sent the judge an extraordinary list of questions about basic aspects of the case			1
mr @entity54 said the questions demonstrated ‘ absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding ’ and he discharged the jury			0
the questions included : ‘ can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it , either from the prosecution or the defence ? ’ lord @entity39 said the case highlighted the need for greater scrutiny of juries ’ deliberations			1
under the @entity76 it is a criminal offence to ask about any opinions expressed during a jury ’s attempts to reach a verdict in a case			0
@entity39 told @entity82 ’s today programme : ‘ we perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do			1
‘ i think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms			0
’ he said other countries allowed researchers to question jurors about their deliberations and thought processes			1
@entity39 added : ‘ i think it ’s one of the greatest strengths of our system that we bring citizens into its heart			1
‘ the feeling of most criminal lawyers is that , by and large , most juries come to the right decision and that most criminal trials end in the right verdict			0
’ @entity113 , the former lord chief justice of england and @entity114 , said he believed the jury system was ‘ well tried ’ and that the @entity13 case was ‘ exceptional ’			1
he said juries acted as the ‘ final safety valve ’ in the legal system because they allowed ordinary men and women to decide a case and to guard against potential miscarriages of justice			0
leading criminal lawyer @entity126 @entity125 said the alternative to trial by jury was the ‘ frightening ’ prospect of all verdicts being reached by judges			2
he added : ‘ sometimes juries get it right , sometimes they get it wrong			0
this is a system based on human beings and human beings are fallible			0
‘ but the alternative is more frightening , the alternative is not being tried by our peers and by a judge			0
’ @entity125 , chairman of the @entity140 , said he thought the @entity13 jury ’s questions were ‘ perfectly sensible ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’s disrespectful to suggest that they were n’t working it through			0
‘ if you were put on trial by the state would you want someone who is salaried by the @entity148 to be judging the facts of it ? of course you would n’t			2
you would want ordinary people to do it			0
’ trial by jury is an expensive process which costs the taxpayer £ 3,000 a day once a case is sent to @entity158			2
several @entity160 and justice ministers have considered reforms to axe the right to jury trial for some offences			2
@entity165 tried to reduce the number of cases that go before juries and @entity169 tried to introduce judge - only trials in complex fraud cases			0
but the proposals met opposition from civil liberty campaigners and the @entity175			0
@entity13 , 60 , will face a retrial over the allegation that she perverted the course of justice by taking her then - husband @entity14 ’s speeding points a decade ago			2
a @entity183 spokesman said : ‘ trial by jury has served us well for hundreds of years and delivers justice across the country every day			2
