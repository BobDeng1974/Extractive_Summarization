@entity2 star @entity1 ’s instructional video series for teens has returned to the place where it all began – the bathroom			1
in the third instalment of his popular online series , the @entity8 father has a simple lesson for teens who leave their wet towels on the floor			1
the tongue - in - cheek clip intended for his own children , @entity17 and @entity18 , teaches teens – and likely some adults – how to hang their used towels on a heated towel rail			2
' @entity23 points to a wet towel left on the bathroom floor mr @entity1 then points to a heated towel rail where the towel should have been placed to dry in the one - minute video , the self - proclaimed ‘ distressed dad ’ points to an offending blue towel on the floor and folds it twice before hanging it on the metal rail			2
he tells the camera : ‘ that ’s all there is to that			0
other places where towels do n’t dry are on your bed , bedroom floor , hall floor , lounge floor , pretty much anywhere with the word floor in it			0
’ writing on his @entity2 page , he said : ‘ in this episode i try and teach them how to hang up their towels so that they dry and can be used more than once ! fold twice : mr @entity1 said he will continue his @entity2 series because it is annoying his children hang to dry : it 's so easy that even a teenager can do it ‘ again , they say no one will be interested and still ca n't believe people watched my first video			1
let 's prove them wrong and show them that us parents do know what we are talking about			0
please do n't let me down ! ' he added : ‘ you may have someone in your life that is n't a teenager but you think still needs to see this video			0
please feel free to share with them too			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s first video taught teenagers how to change an empty toilet roll in the bathroom and went on to surpass four million views , making him somewhat of an online celebrity			1
will @entity1 's other videos have taught teens how to change a loo roll and load a dishwasher he followed that up with a clip that shows teens – and , again , likely a lot of adults – how to load filthy cutlery and crockery into a dishwasher			1
without giving any hints he is promising to release a fourth video soon			0
in his latest video , he tells the camera : ‘ i ’m going to continue using social media because it ’s sort of getting the message across to ( @entity17 and @entity18 ) and it also annoys them ’			2

this is the third video in series produced by @entity8 father @entity1
it is intended for his children but likely contains lessons for some adults too
previous videos taught teens how to change loo roll and load dishwasher
mr @entity1 plans to continue his @entity2 series because it ' annoys ' his kids
