by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 01:50 est , 6 july 2012 the deaths of 25 patients are being reviewed after a leading @entity3 admitted ' poor record keeping ' meant they had lost track of hundreds of patients			1
three local authorities said they were ' extremely concerned ' after @entity8 admitted 900 patients records were incomplete back in may			1
a review group was set up to look at 74 affected patients who had since died			1
doctors have so far found that delays caused by data issues did not cause harm in 49 cases , however 25 cases are still being investigated			1
@entity18 is one of four covered by @entity8 at the height of the problem in february around 3,500 patients were waiting for longer than the 18 - week target for treatments or operations			0
it has emerged that some cancer patients ended up on a waiting list for up to two years when they should have been seen within a fortnight			2
the @entity3 has also been unable to get in contact with 86 people who were referred for a possible cancer diagnosis after letters sent to their last known addresses in may went unanswered			1
it means potentially that dozens of cancer patients may have died or suffered complications as a result of mismanagement			2
the problems first emerged in january after the @entity3 admitted finding that hundreds of patient records were incomplete			1
files on some patients were opened but not closed while others were duplicated			0
a joint letter from @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , and @entity50 and @entity51 said they were unhappy that the @entity3 had responded to their resulting scrutiny with a ' lack of openness and transparency			0
' councillor @entity57 of the @entity58 at @entity59 , told @entity60 : ' @entity61 have acted dangerously and irresponsibly by allowing patients entrusted to their care suffer a possible deterioration of their condition			0
' managers were more worried about their reputation than about patient safety			0
in a public forum they said no - one had come to harm			0
we believe they deliberately misled the council			0
' the @entity3 runs four @entity76 hospitals : @entity18 , @entity48 , @entity77 's and @entity51 and @entity78 's			2
the @entity79 said the errors ' may have caused distress and uncertainty for vulnerable patients ' a spokeswoman for the @entity3 says they do n't believe any patients have come to serious harm as a result of the lost data			1
' to date we have found no evidence that these patients have come to clinical harm as a result of our poor record keeping , ' she said			0
' we are extremely sorry that this situation was not identified and resolved earlier			0
' a @entity79 spokesperson said : ' the situation at @entity8 was completely unacceptable , and may have caused distress and uncertainty for vulnerable patients			1
' that 's why when we became aware of this situation in april we sought assurances that this would become an urgent part of the work being undertaken by a team of external experts who were working within the @entity3			1
' those experts have helped the @entity3 to make sure that the right processes are in place so patients should get the care they need , when they need it in future			2
we will continue to monitor the situation			0

hundreds of patient records found to be incomplete earlier this year
review group investigating whether treatment delays played a part in 25 patient deaths
86 patients referred for possible cancer diagnosis still *unaccounted* for
@entity79 says situation was ' completely unacceptable ' while @entity124 brands @entity3 's actions as ' dangerous and irresponsible '
