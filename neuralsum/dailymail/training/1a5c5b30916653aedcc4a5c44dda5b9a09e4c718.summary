by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the welcome to @entity4 billboard that appeared on monday was the work of a bookmaker and not , it has to be said , anything to do with @entity8 or their new manager @entity9			1
the @entity10 is pictured in triumphant pose , mimicking the poster dedicated to @entity13 by @entity14 which caused more than its fair share of commotion after the forward swapped @entity19 for the @entity20 five years ago			1
monday 's imitation might have been little more than a publicity stunt , but the timing could not have been better because the moment has come for @entity25 to make his mark in @entity27 too			2
in four days ’ time , @entity58 are the visitors for the opening @entity60 game of the season and the @entity25 era will begin in earnest			2
after getting to work on overhauling the coaching staff , playing squad and formation at @entity8 , he must now set about rebuilding the fortress established under sir @entity69 , whose @entity19 became the stuff of nightmares for @entity72 during his ill - fated spell			1
not only did the likes of @entity14 , @entity39 and @entity76 walk away from @entity19 with three points , it turned into a happy hunting ground for @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 — teams who previously had never given themselves a prayer at @entity8 — as records tumbled			1
@entity8 went out of both domestic cups at home and the fear factor that had gripped opponents for so long was suddenly transmitted to them			0
blue moon : @entity14 famously created a ' welcome to @entity27 ' billboard after signing @entity13 that it is not something @entity25 will tolerate			1
already he appears to have re-established a winning mentality in a group aware of the price of failure			0
it would be dangerous to read too much into pre-season , but @entity8 have won all five games under their new boss , including matches against @entity104 , @entity39 and @entity105			0
@entity56 are next and the fact @entity25 has had his opponents scouted indicates he is treating it as more than a friendly			1
@entity8 are expecting a crowd in excess of 60,000 , although tickets were still available over the weekend so there are no guarantees the game will be a sellout			0
new signings @entity116 and @entity118 are set to make their home debuts but @entity25 is unlikely to risk @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 after all three players had extra time off following the @entity125			2
the @entity8 boss met with @entity121 over the weekend and it is understood the @entity129 midfielder has not been told outright he will be sold			0
however , @entity25 made it clear the £ 27.5million signing from @entity80 last summer will not be first choice and the possibility of a move to @entity135 remains			0
uncertain future : @entity121 could yet leave the club amid interest from @entity135			0

a *mammoth* billboard welcoming @entity9 to @entity8 has been created in the city
@entity143 reads ' welcome to @entity4 ' with @entity10 imposed on a red background
stunt was created by betting firm @entity30 and can be seen on @entity147
@entity25 leads @entity8 at @entity19 for the first time against @entity56
