the gang conned the innocent 23 - year - old into flying to @entity14 on a bogus passport with the promise of education , a job and a new home			1
before leaving @entity2 , she was raped and forced to go through a black magic ‘ juju ’ death ritual to prevent her running away			1
but when the woman arrived in @entity27 , her employment failed to materialise			2
instead , she was told she was destined to work as a sex slave in @entity30 , a court heard			1
the plan was only thwarted when @entity30 authorities spotted her forged @entity33 and sent her back to the @entity3			2
it is believed the woman is just one of many victims of the group , based in @entity39 , that trafficks young women through @entity41 to work as prostitutes in mainland @entity43			0

@entity51 , 48 , was acquitted of the same charge following a trial at the @entity54			0

the victim , who only spoke a little @entity41 , had been recruited by a @entity2 local called @entity59 in her home village near @entity61			2
her family had struggled financially since the death of her father in 2008 , but she aspired to become a nurse			0
in february 2011 , @entity59 offered to help the young woman by sending her to @entity41 to be educated properly and get a job , the court heard			0
she was told the cost would be £ 40,000 - which she would have to repay to the organisers			1
prosecutor @entity78 told the court : ‘ she had no idea at all what £ 40,000 was in her own currency , her life had been very hard after her father died , and she jumped at the chance to be educated and be trained for a job , and get away from the desperation and misery of her current family situation			1
‘ she was very excited , a naive young girl , at the prospect of going abroad			0
’ she was sent to the @entity2 capital of @entity85 on march 23 , 2011 , to meet a man called @entity87 who made her a false passport and coached her in getting through @entity3 immigration			1
‘ while he was doing that , he began to sexually assault her ’ , said mr @entity78			0
‘ that led him to beat her with a belt and that in turn led to him raping her that night			0
’ when she complained to @entity96 the next morning , she was told : ‘ it was what you should have expected ’			0
she was then told to pose for photos with a man who would pretend to be her husband			0
in september 2011 she was summoned to the west @entity39 country of @entity61 to get a visa			0
the woman was then told to swear an oath to repay the money in a ceremony that involved cutting her armpit and pubic hair and taking finger nail clippings			1
guilty : @entity45 was also convicted for trafficking the woman			2
the court heard how the innocent girl was raped and forced to go through a voodoo ritual before coming to the @entity3 ‘ the oath she was solemnly required to take was to repay that money , £ 40,000 , on pain of death if she did not , ’ said mr @entity78			1
‘ this was what was known as a juju ceremony			0
’ she was driven to @entity85 on september 12 , 2011 and put on a plane to the @entity3 , meeting @entity0 at @entity14			2
@entity0 , calling himself ‘ @entity128 ’ , checked her into the @entity129 in @entity130 , south @entity27 , and took away her money and passport			2
she was next taken to the house of @entity134 , an old friend of @entity59 ’s , and kept there for a few weeks with no sign of a job or education			0
@entity45 ’s son , who suffers from learning difficulties , groped her on the first night in the house in @entity142 , southeast @entity27			2
but when she complained , @entity45 allegedly told her : ‘ what do you think you are here for ? ’ the woman was told she was being sent to @entity30 on october 3 , 2011 , and collected another false passport from @entity0 ’s home			1
‘ it was then for the first time that this very young girl from a small village in @entity39 , miles away from home , realised she was about to be sent to @entity30 to be forced into prostitution ’ , mr @entity78 said			0
sex slave : when the woman arrived in the @entity3 , she was kept at a house in @entity27 before being told she was going to @entity30 , the @entity54 ( pictured ) heard			1
only then did she realise she was being sold in to prostitution ‘ she came to that gradual realisation , and she suddenly remembered hearing conversations between some men and their girls in @entity30			0
‘ she could n’t speak @entity30 and there was no question of her being able to work in @entity30 in the normal sense			0
‘ she became very upset and fearful of what awaited her			0
’ the gang ’s plan was thwarted by @entity30 immigration officials , who stopped the woman on an obviously forged passport at @entity172 and sent her straight back to the @entity3			1
after she was detained by immigration officials , the woman led them to the alleged identity factory in @entity51 ’s flat in @entity176 , southeast @entity27 , and laptops which had been used to make false documents by @entity0			2
mr @entity78 said the @entity179 launched @entity180 after quizzing the woman ‘ to penetrate and stop the activities of an organised crime group based in @entity39 and here in @entity41 , which has as its aim the trafficking of vulnerable young women from @entity2 to @entity43 countries , including @entity30 and @entity188 for the purpose of prostitution ’ @entity44 , of @entity176 , southeast @entity27 , @entity0 , of @entity191 , southeast @entity27 , and @entity134 , of @entity142 , south @entity27 denied conspiracy to traffic a person to the @entity3 for the purpose of sexual exploitation , and conspiracy to traffic a person out of the @entity3 for the purpose of sexual exploitation			1
