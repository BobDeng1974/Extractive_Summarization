by @entity167 , @entity168 ’ international creative director and four times winner of @entity173 @entity172 ( t : 0207 485 7272 / w : @entity174 ) how to go brunette to blonde ? if you are looking to try a new edgy look , going platinum is a great way to stop people in their tracks - especially an all over platinum blonde and i think this is exactly what @entity2 and @entity11 are looking to do at the moment			1
usually as @entity187 , we look to give our clients the most suitable , beautiful hair colour , working with their skin tone , eye colour etc. to give them a look tailored perfectly to them			0
this colour on @entity2 is none of the above but is very editorial , high fashion and certainly creates a statement			2
at some point in her life every woman needs to make the jump from brunette to blonde , although there are many variations it is important to remember when going for such an extreme blonde to consider the effects on your hairs condition , you will need to do regular treatments to keep it feeling healthy			0
best product to use ? for any woman looking to achieve this look , i would advise it be only done professionally to avoid serious damage and brassy tones			0
at @entity220 , we use @entity222 products and would obtain this look by using the @entity224			0
how to maintain the colour blonde ? to maintain your blonde hue , i would recommend @entity232 ‘ hero product ’ @entity230 ( £ 16.50 @ @entity220 ) to keep the blonde fresh and clean and prevent it from going brassy .			0
