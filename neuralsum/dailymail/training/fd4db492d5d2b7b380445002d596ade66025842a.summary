faced with a sniffly date , most of us would think twice about locking lips			0
yet a leading professor says a cold should n't get in the way of romance – because you ca n't catch one by kissing			1
this is despite the fact a survey has found 57 per cent of us would reject a first kiss with someone suffering from a case of the sniffles			1
professor @entity17 , director of the @entity18 at @entity19 , explained that the virus is spread through mucus , not saliva			1
when it comes to avoiding a cold , it 's safer to give your partner a kiss than hold their hand , experts say so while 86 per cent of us would prefer to hold hands with someone with a cold , according to the research , you 're actually more likely to be infected that way – as fingers easily become contaminated , passing the virus to the nose and eye			1
the research , carried out by nasal decongestant @entity42 , found that a potential partner turning up on a date with a common cold is a major turn - off			2
indeed , a fifth of us ( 21 per cent ) would cancel a second romantic rendezvous if our date had turned up with the sniffles			0
seeing a date wipe their nose on their sleeve is too much for four in five @entity57 ( 79 per cent ) , who would not go on a second date			0
over half ( 59 per cent ) also said eating with an open mouth was a turn off while coughing ( 34 per cent ) and sneezing ( 32 per cent ) were the top turns off for others			2
the study of 1,000 brits also suggests females are more wary of falling ill. women are less likely to kiss someone with a cold ( 70 per cent would n't compared to 44 per cent of men )			1
a cautious fifth of us ( 22 per cent ) would n't share a bed with a partner if they had a cold and 46 per cent would n't lock lips			2
professor @entity17 said : ' the common cold virus travels in the mucus from the respiratory system			1
a survey found 57 per cent of us would reject a first kiss with someone suffering from a cold ( file photo ) ' so unless you have a bad cough , and some of the respiratory mucus has made its way into your saliva , the cold virus will not be transmitted by kissing			1
' he added : ' the cold virus is transferred by contaminated fingers that pass the virus to the nose and eye			2
' your fingers can easily become contaminated with viruses by holding hands with someone who has coughed or sneezed into their hands , or by touching door handles in public places			0
' you may then touch your nose or eye and infect yourself			0
tears from the eye drain via a duct into the nasal cavity and when we touch our eyes with contaminated fingers we pass viruses into the nose			0
' to spread the infection you need to have close and prolonged contact with other people , to cough or sneeze on them , or pass on secretions from your nose via your hands			1
' @entity118 , from @entity42 , said : ' the research demonstrates peoples lack of understanding surrounding the common cold			0
' many do not understand how cold and flu viruses are transferred , putting themselves at greater risk of catching a cold			0

more than half of people would reject a first kiss with someone with a cold
but professor @entity17 says a cold should n't get in the way of romance
he explained that the virus is spread through mucus , not saliva and it 's actually worse to hold hands
