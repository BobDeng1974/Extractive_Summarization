by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 12:08 est , 10 october 2012 the @entity2 combination says it is a billion in one match of @entity4 and @entity5 a mixture of a retired teacher 's dna and that of the man accused of her murder has a one - in - a - billion match after it was found on the back of her hand , a court heard today			1
a ' full dna profile ' of drifter @entity4 , 48 , was found on a swab taken from @entity5 ’ left hand following the discovery of her body			1
the 77 - year - old was found stabbed to death in her cottage , in @entity25 , @entity26 , on january 4 , having been killed two days earlier			1
@entity4 , of no fixed address , claims he saw mrs @entity5 on december 30 but @entity28 heard the location the dna sample was found would make it ' extremely rare ' to get such a strong profile days later			1
forensic scientist @entity33 told the jury : ' the dna profile obtained showed a mixture of @entity2 from two people which matched the corresponding dna profiles of mrs @entity5 and @entity4			1
' we found that it is a billion times more likely to have come from @entity5 and @entity4 than from @entity5 and someone other than @entity4			1
' mr @entity33 said he would expect the dna to only stay on the hands for a relatively short period of time			0
' typically washing is the best way of removing it , or contact with other surfaces , ' he said			0
' you would expect the hands to be regularly washed and in contact with other items			0
' mr @entity33 said given the strength of the dna profile he would expect there to have been either direct physical contact between mrs @entity5 and @entity4 or for it to have come from a bodily fluid - potentially saliva or sweat			1
@entity4 , who has a personality disorder , denies murdering @entity5 , right , but admits the manslaughter of @entity64 on the grounds of diminished responsibility he added it was ' extremely rare ' to find a dna profile in such a strong level in active life after just 12 hours			1
when questioned by @entity4 ’s barrister @entity71 about the possibility of ' secondary transfer ' - meaning that @entity4 may have touch a surface and mrs @entity5 picked up the dna from that surface - mr @entity33 said it is ' very rare ' to detect dna in the levels they have found from secondary transfer			1
the court heard a number of swabs were taken from mrs @entity5 but the sample from the back of her left hand gave the strongest profile			2
@entity4 , who was not present to hear the evidence having declined to come to court , denies the murder of mrs @entity5			1
accused @entity4 has pleaded guilty to burgling another property , where a note was found threatening to kill ' @entity92 scum ' he is also standing trial for the murder of @entity95 , found stabbed to death at his home in @entity98 , @entity99 , on february 14			2
@entity4 admits the manslaughter of mr @entity95 on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder			1
he has pleaded guilty to burgling another property , @entity105 , also in @entity98 , over the @entity107 and @entity108 period , where a note was found threatening to kill ' @entity92 scum '			0
the jury heard yesterday that investigators examined mrs @entity5 ’s home for two weeks following the discovery of her body			2
mr @entity33 , who has worked as a forensic scientist since 1998 , attended the scene on january 5			0
this shows the scene at the home of retired schoolteacher , @entity5 , 77 , where @entity2 was found on her hand upsetting : @entity5 was found stabbed to death at her home , picture , in january this year he said mrs @entity5 was laid at the bottom of the stairs dressed in a woollen jumper , black tracksuit bottoms and with socks and clogs on her feet			1
he agreed that her head was laid on a cushion from her sofa , with the knife sticking out of her neck and that arms were in a raised position and her legs slightly twisted			0
' i looked closely at the location of the knife and how it was in her body , ' mr @entity33 said			0
' when you looked closely at the jumper it was folded			0
the knife had passed through three layers , so as it was folded it went through one layer , then another fold , then the collar and into her neck			0
' he said that after the body had been removed they did not find any blood under the cushion her head had been laid on			0
' it was as i would expect if she had been hit and stabbed in the position in which she was found , ' he said			0
horror : this is an aerial view of the scene in @entity98 where reverend @entity95 was found dead in february last year sad : floral tributes were left outside of the vicarage following the death of reverend @entity95 the jury were shown a long walking stick and a two inch long splinter that had broken off the stick			2
mr @entity33 said blood found on the walking stick matched that of mrs @entity5			2
@entity4 was arrested in @entity175 , @entity176 in february after @entity177 launched a nationwide manhunt after mr @entity95 ’s body was discovered			2
@entity4 has a severe personality disorder , which the prosecution accepts			2
the trial was adjourned until tomorrow			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
