by @entity0 published : 14:18 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 14:18 est , 15 july 2013 a string of little villages on the island of @entity4 , off @entity6 ’s south coast , is supposedly home to one of the longest - lived groups of people on earth			1
@entity12 claims to have one of the highest ratios of centenarians in the world - more than 200 residents out of a population of 560,000			1
it also prides itself to at least three ‘ supercentenarians ’ – residents aged over 110 – meaning they claim nearly one per cent of the less than 400 thought to exist worldwide			0
@entity23 force : a group of women at a tea house in @entity27 , in @entity6 's southern @entity4 province , an area which has one of the oldest populations on earth one of many : @entity34 , aged 103 , is one of 200 centenarians living in the @entity12 area @entity37 and happy life : an elderly man flashes a broad grin outside at a tea house in @entity12 city communities with a higher than normal percentage can be found across the globe			1
discovered on @entity47 , @entity49 islands , in @entity50 and on a peninsula in @entity52 , researchers find that they share common traits in the way they live their lives			0
all live in close - knit communities with emphasis on family lives , their rural locations and tradition means their lifestyles require [ physical activity in some way – many are farmers – and their diet is mainly plant - based			2
this can definitely be said to be true for @entity12			2
its elderly residents have seen the rise and fall of the @entity70 , the coming of @entity72 , one – or in some cases even two – world wars and the revolution of technology , yet little has changed in the way the population of @entity12 ’s villages live their lives			2
golden age : @entity82 , right , gestures to one of his neighbours in @entity27 on the island of @entity4 family matters : @entity87 , right , talking with her sister - in - law in @entity27 , an area where the longevity of residents has been credited to close - knit families staying active : researchers credit strong family ties and life of physically demanding labour , such as agricultural work , with keeping the @entity12 residents living for more than a century they have always been , and still remains , an agricultural people			1
‘ i 've never done any exercise , except hard farmwork , ’ 86 year - old @entity100 told @entity101			0
he lives in a simple concrete shack with his wife @entity105 , who he married the day after @entity50 's @entity107 surrender , 68 years ago			0
their one - storey dwelling is barely furnished and @entity82 draws water from a well to spread on his small vegetable plot – but despite his age he still grows crops			0
researchers hail this simple lifestyle as one of the key ingredients for the longevity of @entity12 ’s residents			0
@entity121 , who runs the @entity122 and @entity123 of the @entity125 - based @entity124 , said : ‘ there is not a lot of industry , the climate is good , they can get exercise easily , and the diet is healthy			2

as one : @entity34 , 103 , listen in during a family get - together at her house in @entity27 , where it is claimed there are more elderly residents than anywhere else in the world memories : @entity34 , born in 1909 , has seen the rise and fall of the @entity70 , the birth of @entity6 , two world wars and the @entity50 occupation proof : @entity34 , is having a rest as her daughter - in - law checks her birth certificate , showing that she is , in fact , over 100 years old black on white : @entity34 's daughter - in - law shows the centenarian 's birth certificate , proving her date of birth in 1909 ‘ if you 're living in a climate like that you do n't need very much to be comfortable : simple housing , a mosquito net , some rattan chairs and other people to hang out with , ’ ms @entity121 added			1
a study commissioned by @entity12 's @entity174 committee put its residents ' lifespans down to their being ‘ diligent , simple - minded and magnanimous , mainly taking a vegetarian diet , eating sensibly , early to bed early to rise			1
’ however , if you ask the locals , it is something completely different that keeps them going			0
@entity34 , whose residency permit lists her as 104 , said the key to her long life is her daily shots of ‘ @entity188 ’ a local grain spirit			1
‘ i drink alcohol every evening , just a little bit , it helps you feel warm , ’ added @entity190 , an 80 - year - old who says she has 31 children and grandchildren			0
friendships : a group of elderly men playing at a tea house in @entity12 city community : the elderly population gather daily for banter , games , opera and exercise at the local teahouses around @entity12 in it to win it : wrinkled hands check the domino bricks as the group of elderly men play a game over coins and rocks healthy reasons : while researchers hail the climate , simple lifestyles and a close - knit community , locals praise everything from alcohol to peanut oil for keeping them young			1
