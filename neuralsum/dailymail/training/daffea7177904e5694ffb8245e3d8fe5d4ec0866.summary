@entity1 's fumble allowed @entity2 to open the scoring on wednesday night , and adds to a catalogue of unsure performances from the @entity6 between the sticks this season			1
former @entity9 ‘ keeper @entity10 has put the blame for @entity13 ’s poor start to the season on @entity1 , who he says is ' worse than @entity15 '			1
' he does n’t command his area , ' @entity10 told @entity17 this week			2
' i ’ve likened @entity1 to worse than @entity15 because at least @entity15 comes out of his coffin now and then			1
' here 's what @entity22 's @entity21 and @entity23 think about @entity1 's situation			2
@entity1 ( centre ) struggles to get up after fumbling a shot from distance @entity29 pounces on @entity1 's mistake to put @entity2 1 - 0 up after less than three minutes @entity1 ( centre ) shows his frustration at his mistake by booting the ball away @entity21 ' people were quick to defend @entity1 for the opening goal , saying the ball bounced awkwardly in front of him , but he was at fault			1
' keepers warm up for such a long time these days so there must be something wrong with his preparation			0
' it should n’t have been a surprise to him that the surface was uneven			0
he will know it was an awful mistake			0
' he seems to have a big problem with long - range efforts - with another one hitting him in the face			0
@entity1 is having a tough time and he needs to do better			2
' @entity1 appears to shows his anger toward team - mate @entity53 , who looks equally frustrated @entity1 had another night to forget in the @entity13 goal and his critics continue to mount up @entity23 ' it 's a major concern @entity13 just ca n't make a clean sheet now , ' @entity23 said , speaking on @entity58			1
' it 's another mistake for him and it 's getting to the stage now ... @entity62 was taken out of the team tonight , he [ @entity1 ] probably needs the same at the moment			1
' the problem is , @entity67 on the bench is not better than @entity1 , is that the answer ? ' it 's not just about a keeper , it 's any player			2
sometimes you think you 'll play yourself out of the bad form , we 've been there ourselves			0
' sometimes it is good to step back out of the limelight and let others have a go			0
' @entity23 revealed his concern at @entity13 's inability to keep clean sheets this season @entity85 ( here 's what @entity86 had to say ) ‘ hopefully it is not an issue with his confidence , ’ said @entity86 , after @entity1 's recent criticism			1
‘ it was a disappointment for the team because we wanted a solid start and to go behind so early very frustrating			0
‘ the pitch was difficult for the outfield players and the goalkeepers ; it was very bobbly , especially around the box			0
thankfully it did n’t cost us overall and the players showed great character to come back			0
' @entity13 boss @entity86 hopes @entity1 will not be affected by his latest mistake			1
