by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:24 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:48 est , 27 december 2013 a farmer has claimed his chickens lay more eggs when he plays them soothing operatic music			1
@entity7 , 64 , says egg production soared when he started playing the hits of @entity10 within earshot of his 24 hens while building a barn at his farm in @entity15 , @entity16			1
when mr @entity7 went to collect eggs shortly afterwards , he noticed there were around double the number he had expected to find			2
good egg : farmer @entity7 says his hens started to lay more once he began playing them the hits of @entity10 he says the dramatic increase , which saw the hens raise their output from four to eight eggs a week each , is all down to his taste for the classic songs of musical theatre			1
mr @entity7 , who has worked on the farm for 20 years , said : ‘ we were building a barn at the time so we always had music playing in the background			1
’ he added : ‘ while building it we noticed the hens were laying more eggs and we put two and two together and realised it was because of the music			2
’ mr @entity7 claims his hens only appreciate certain kinds of music however , adding that he doubts ‘ modern chart rubbish ’ by the likes of @entity43 or @entity44 would have had such a positive impact			1
he said : ‘ i 'm not really a fan of new music and i do n't think the chickens will be either so i 'll stick to the traditional stuff			0
’ cultured hens : the farmer claims his chickens would n't appreciate ' modern chart rubbish ' such as @entity43 and @entity44 mr @entity7 , who won @entity56 's best organic farm shop in 2005 , believes the main reason the hens are producing more eggs is because the music makes them more relaxed and happy			1
dramatic : the chickens are said to be fans of @entity65			0
a 2004 film adaption of the musical starred @entity68 ( pictured ) ‘ happy animals produce better goods so by playing some soothing opera classics they are able to relax a lot more than they usually would , ’ he says			2
mr @entity7 is n’t the first farmer to claim exposure to classical music has a positive effect on his chickens			1
in 2008 @entity79 - a farmer in @entity80 - claimed his 70,000 chickens reacted positively to the soothing strains of @entity83			2
he told @entity84 that , despite experimenting with pop music , he found @entity83 worked best as it has fewer dramatic tempo changes and there was less talking between songs			0
in 2011 a farm in @entity91 ’s @entity90 conducted an experiment in which 20,000 chickens were played a mixture of classical , rap , pop and jazz			0
the results suggested that the hens were not particularly bothered by the different genres and would simply lay more eggs as long as there was a consistent rhythm drowning out any stress - inducing background noise			0
the theory has been backed by experts who say music can have a calming influence on animals			0
@entity112 , vice chairman of the @entity113 , said : ‘ a lot of people play music to chickens as a way of helping them to relax … it 's a good idea because it blocks out any background noises which are prone to upset them			0
’ he added : ‘ but i do n't know why they would prefer a specific type of music , they must be very cultured chickens			0
’ top technique : the hens produce more eggs because the music relaxes them mr @entity7 is happy in role as an egg pioneer , and hopes more farmers follow his example and begin experimenting with music			1
he says : ‘ i 'm thrilled that it has worked and i 'm pretty sure a few more farmers across the country are doing it now as well ’ .			0
