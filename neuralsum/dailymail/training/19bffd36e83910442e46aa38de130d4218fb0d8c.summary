fossils of bacteria found in @entity2 are the oldest yet discovered anywhere on @entity4 and predate the formation of oxygen on our planet , new research claims			1
the fossils found in north - west @entity2 's @entity11 are thought to be nearly 3.5billion years old and caused by bacteria which existed just one billion years after the @entity4 formed			1
now @entity14 's @entity13 , one of the researchers who worked on the project , says the discovery could help inform @entity19 's searches for traces of life on the @entity22			1
a boulder trapped in the @entity24 , pilbara : researchers examining sedimentary rocks in this region of @entity2 claim they have found the world 's oldest fossils which date back 3.5billion years she told the @entity31 the bacteria traces ' are the oldest fossils ever described			1
those are our oldest ancestors			0
' the fossils are spider web - like imprints on the surfaces of sandstone which are thought to have been sculpted by once - living organisms interacting with sediment			1
in a process that still takes place in some parts of the world today , thick mats of bacteria are thought to have trapped and glued together sand particles beneath them and protected them from erosion			2
sand stuck in this way gradually turned into rock with its particular texture shaped by the living organism that once covered it			0
the ancient rocks in @entity2 's @entity11 region are some of the oldest anywhere on earth			1
once shoreline , the sedimentary rocks in the area piled up billions of years ago and are now exposed for examination			2
scientists have discovered older rocks , but professor @entity13 told @entity69 that those rocks have eroded to the point traces of life are all but impossible to find			1
' i can confidently say the structures we 're working on can not be found on older rocks — until now , there has been bothing that is this well preserved , ' she said			2
' there are some that are much older , but they experience metamorphosis - anything that 's on them has been overprinted and it 's difficult to reconstruct what was there			2
' the first dinosaur to have walked on @entity4 may have been found by scientists			2
@entity88 would have been alive 10 to 15 million years before any previously known dinosaurs - and more than 150million years before the mighty @entity90			1
the size of a @entity92 and slight of build , @entity88 had a five foot - long tail and likely walked upright on two legs			2
with only a few ribs and arm bones to go on , the scientists ca n't be sure what the world 's oldest dinosaur ate			0
however , it is likely it had a similar diet to other early dinosaurs of small prey , insects and plants			0
the remains do allow for its size to be estimated			0
@entity88 is believed to have been 6.5 to 10ft from nose to tail , with its tail accounting for half of @entity116 slight build means it would have lived ' in the shadow ' of other much larger reptiles alive at the time			0
the patterns found by @entity122 and her colleagues are ridges which criss - cross the rocks like strands in a spider 's web , hinting that primitive bacteria linked up in sprawling networks			2
like many such bacterial colonies which still exist today , they may have lived in the equivalent of microbial cities hosting different kinds of bacteria all communicating via chemical signals , the @entity31 reports			0
it is thought the ancient microbes fed on sulphur , as many still do today			0
the textures seen in the @entity143 rocks are similar to those already seen in 2.9billion - year - old rocks from @entity146 which professor @entity13 and colleagues reported on in 2007			0
however , old @entity143 rocks have deceived researchers in the past			0
rippling layers found in some from the @entity152 , also in @entity2 , were claimed in 1980 to be the work of bacteria , but subsequent research showed the patterns could be formed by natural non-organic processes			1
in an effort to corroborate their most recent findings , professor @entity13 and her colleagues measured the carbon that made up the textured rocks			0
they found the tell - tale signatures of ' organic ' carbon - 13 that usually comes from living beings			1
' it ’s always nice to have a number of different lines of evidence , and you definitely want to see organic carbon , ' said dr @entity174 , a geomicrobiologist at @entity175 , @entity176			0
the discovery could now help inform further searches for life on @entity22 , where such remnants of life may be even better preserved thanks to a lack of geological processes shaking things up like on @entity4			1
@entity187 's curiosity rover is equipped with instruments able to detect similar fossils , professor @entity13 told @entity69			0
' our structure is one of the structures the rover is looking for — if we 've found sedimentary structures like that on @entity4 's most well - preserved rocks , could they be on rocks of similar ages on @entity22 ? ' she added .			1

the fossils found in north - west @entity2 are thought to be 3.5bn years old
not actual *petrified* remains , they are rather traces of organic processes
researchers claim the discovery could help the search for life on @entity22
