@entity1 's latest blog post on her lifestyle website @entity2 deals with ' perfection ' from running a website advising fans on how to eat , think , work and dress , to falling out with @entity10 over an unapproved article , @entity5 is notorious for striving to be ‘ perfect ’			1
but it seems the 41 - year - old may be thinking about relaxing a little			2
becoming rather philosophical recently on her lifestyle blog @entity2 , the mother - of - two shared some thoughts with her fans about ‘ perfection ’			1
the actress says : ‘ striving for achieving a sense of perfection has been a misguided belief in my life , often leading me down the wrong path			1
‘ it has made me , at times , place value on the wrong things			0
it has made me not listen to my true self for fear that i would somehow fail in another 's eyes			0
i was curious as to how the idea of perfection has become so pervasive in our society , how it begins , how it hurts us and perhaps , even , if it carries a certain benefit			2
’ she then poses the question ; ' where does this idea that we need to be perfect come from ? ' how can we come to terms with ( and find the beauty in ) imperfection ? ’ guest posts from dr. @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity45 , dr. @entity48 , @entity45 and @entity49 on the issues surrounding perfectionism and how a person can break free of it appear next to the actress 's musings			2
@entity1 , who is in the process of separating , or ‘ consciously uncoupling ’ , from husband @entity58 , has taken great pains to keep the pair 's public image very positive			1
whatever is going on behind the scenes , the only side presented to the media is one of happy , mature adults , with seemingly no ill - will toward each other , parting ways while remaining a united parenting team			0
the actress says : ' striving for achieving a sense of perfection has been a misguided belief in my life , often leading me down the wrong path ' @entity1 , who is in the process of separating , or ' consciously uncoupling ' , from husband @entity58 , has taken great pains to keep the pairs public image very positive their super-civilised split has reportedly been taken to a new level by hiring an ‘ emotional guru ’ to help ease the pain of their split			1
celebrity healer @entity87 , 39 , who claims she helped princes @entity89 and @entity90 deal with the aftermath of princess @entity93 ’s death , is paying weekly 90 - minute visits to @entity5 and @entity58 to administer a range of wacky treatments – including a ‘ @entity99 ’ ritual , salt - and - pepper baths , ‘ @entity100 ’ and ‘ positive self - affirmation ’ chanting			0
however , this latest post on @entity2 may raise questions over whether the stunning actress is growing tired of always seeming so together and perfect			1
@entity5 suggested that even water has feelings in a post in june and encouraged her @entity2 readers to consider the impact that unkind words may have on its molecular structure			1
on her blog , @entity1 cited the work of messages from water author @entity115 , whose studies have involved talking , shouting and playing music to water to observe the effects			0
@entity1 wrote on @entity2 : ‘ i am fascinated by the growing science behind the energy of consciousness and its effects on matter			2
‘ i have long had dr. @entity115 's coffee table book on how negativity changes the structure of water , how the molecules behave differently depending on the words or music being expressed around it			0
’ @entity132 scientist @entity115 ’s hypothesis began with the belief that water adopts the ‘ resonance ’ of the energy around it , and that polluted water can be restored through prayers and @entity137 his findings have been widely dismissed by the scientific community for a lack of experimental rigour leaving the studies open to the influence of human error			0
in 2003 , @entity115 declined to take part in skeptic @entity149 's one million dollar @entity148 , which would have won him $ 1,000,000 had he been able to replicate the experiment under test conditions .			0
