as for damages , the couple are asking for $ 10million - and that the tree be removed			1
' that 's not all either , with the couple saying their concrete foundation and front stoop have also been compromised , all 14 doors in the two - family home are unable to close because of the damage to the foundation and the facade of the home could become damaged next if the tree does not go soon			1
as for the reason behind the lawsuit , the @entity28 claim they have been trying to get in touch with @entity4 for a year to no avail			1
@entity4 , who bought the townhouse in 2008 for $ 9.5 million and has focused on remodeling the ritzy residence since then , has yet to respond to this lawsuit , though his lawyer , @entity64 , did admit he was shocked when told just how much the @entity28 are looking for in damages			1
' he refuses to do anything			0
he ’s owned it for six years and neglected it			0
i like him personally but he ’s stubborn and he has a lawyer who is very belligerent , ' explained mr. @entity1			0
even ms. @entity1 , who says she is pro-tree , wants the tree gone			2
' i hate to see this tree come down , but it ’s destroying my stoop , ' said the actress			0
' there are cracks everywhere			0
the masons do n’t want to make repairs because they say it ’s just going to happen again , ' added mr. @entity1			0
' i want him to take the tree down and pay my expenses			0
i tried but you ca n’t talk to him			0
' the couple 's daughter @entity86 ( above ) admits that while she hates to see a tree cut down , it is destroying her parents ' brownstone as for the tree , it is an invasive species that was introduced to the @entity93 through @entity94 , nicknamed by some as the @entity96			2
it is also known the for the sour odor it produces when cut , grows new roots constantly and moves those roots around to steal from the supply of other plants - or even crack the walls of a basement			1
the @entity105 revealed that even @entity4 's own arborist and mason were aware of the problems the tree , which is also hollow and rotting , was causing , and urged him to chop it down			2
this is not the first time @entity4 's home has wrecked havoc on the @entity115 , with a pipe burst happening early last year that forced the duo to move in with their daughter			1
the @entity115 , who purchased the home in 1994 , also rent out a duplex in the brownstone for $ 9,000 a month .			2
