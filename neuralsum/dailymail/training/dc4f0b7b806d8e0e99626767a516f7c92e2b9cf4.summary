@entity13 terrier @entity12 has become a frequent passenger aboard the £ 750,000 semi-submersible craft @entity15 designed by her owner @entity17			1
mr @entity17 , chief executive of his own concept design company , spent 35,000 hours perfecting the two - seater underwater vessel			1
mr @entity17 , 59 , said : ' @entity12 knew what the sub was all about as she ’s been with me all through the various stages			0
' she ’s often seen it in the factory and @entity43 always seems to wag her tail when it ’s mentioned			0
' as well as joining her owner on underwater visits , @entity12 has also accompanied mr @entity17 on motorcycle and quad - bike rides			2
touring the coast : mr @entity17 and his dog @entity12 are often spotted taking a trip along the @entity35 coastline launch pad : the vessel can be launched from its custom - built carrier the @entity57 - 02 or via a tracked version from the shore he added : ' we 're practically inseparable			1
no matter what i do , she 's there with me and she 's a proper adrenaline junkie			0
' mr @entity17 decided to design his underwater vessel after narrowly avoiding a shark attack while swimming in @entity67 25 years ago			2
he added : ' i was around half a mile from shore doing the backstroke when i got the feeling that i was n’t alone			0
' i turned over to see what it was when i was suddenly hit and rolled over twice and i thought " i ’m dead "			0
a man 's best friend : mr @entity17 says he and @entity12 are inseparable and the terrier has even joined him on motorcycle and quad - bike rides safety first : mr @entity17 designed the vessel so he could discover the underwater world without being at risk from sharks and other dangers ' frightened to death i swam as fast as i could for shore before succumbing to cramp			1

' the craft can submerge 4ft below the surface of the water , giving passengers a 360 - degree view of life under the sea through the vessel 's 40mm thick inverted acrylic hemisphere while remaining perfectly safe			1
