by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:59 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 17 march 2013 a mother of six who had to leave a £ 4,000 - a - month townhouse in @entity5 when housing benefit rules changed is fighting to be rehoused in the exclusive area			1
@entity8 and her children had lived for around three years in a £ 2million four - bedroom house near @entity11			1
the estimated £ 1,200 - a - week rent for the three - storey home – which has a garage in an area where a parking space can change hands for more than £ 100,000 – is believed to have been covered almost entirely by housing benefit			1
lavish living : @entity5 is one of the capital 's most exclusive neighbourhoods where properties cost more than £ 6million @entity8 lived in a four bedroom house in @entity5 , near @entity11 ( pictured ) but new rules limiting the benefit to £ 400 a week , designed to stop taxpayers ’ money being spent on houses in the most expensive areas , meant that in december she had to move somewhere cheaper			1
the 38 - year - old accountancy student demanded £ 40,000 from @entity33 city council to help with housing costs and is believed to have been given £ 10,000			0
she found temporary accommodation in @entity36 , @entity37 , an easy ten - mile commute from @entity5			2
but miss @entity8 is still not happy and has appealed to @entity33 council to find and fund another home in @entity5 where the average house costs more than £ 3million			1
she is married to businessman @entity42 , 38 , and has a 50 per cent share in his online fashion business , but told @entity45 that while he ‘ helps a lot ’ , she does not live with him			0
after failing in a @entity48 attempt to keep her housing benefit claim secret , she told the newspaper that she needed to be housed in @entity5 at public expense so that her children can continue to attend their top - rated state primary school , and she can continue her course at @entity55			1
she claimed she was having to travel for two hours on the bus with her children to and from school			2
they do not take the @entity60 , although it is often quicker			0
her children are understood to be aged between one and ten			0
four attend the primary school in @entity5 with a fifth set to start there in september			1
miss @entity8 , who is @entity69 , but was born in @entity70 , @entity71 , said : ‘ my children are suffering because they are overtired all the time			2
they ca n’t do their homework , they fall asleep on their way home			0
‘ when they get home they ca n’t eat their dinner because they are too tired			0
the youngest are getting sick the whole time			0
i am saying the primary school is a very good school – it is close to private education			0
’ relocated : @entity8 was forced to move out of a £ 2million house near @entity11 asked why she was complaining about the ten - mile commute when others , many of whom do not qualify for housing benefit , travel further every day , miss @entity8 said : ‘ i do n’t have a problem with where i live other than the location			1
‘ it is just the long distance from the children ’s school , and i ca n’t change my place of study			2
if you have to attend a nine o’clock lecture , you ca n’t be at both places together			0
’ miss @entity8 said she and her children had been on a six - week holiday to @entity70 last year , but said a cousin paid for the air fares			2
her husband joined them halfway through the holiday she said , but stressed that he did not live with her			0
housing benefit payouts are less likely if a wage - earning husband is living in the same house as a mother			1
miss @entity8 claimed her temporary accommodation in @entity36 was more expensive than the @entity5 townhouse and added : ‘ i do n’t think i have committed a crime by trying to protect my family			1
’ a former neighbour of @entity113 in @entity5 told the @entity114 he was disgusted by her quest for more public money to be spent on rehousing her there , saying : ‘ it ’s entirely unfair and completely ludicrous			2
‘ why should i save up and work hard all my life to own a property that i ’m proud of when she can just come and live here for free ? ’ @entity33 city council cabinet minister for housing , @entity122 , said last night that miss @entity8 ’s case was being investigated by its fraud team			1
he said : ‘ this investigation is ongoing , so we can not comment on the specific details			0
@entity33 city council are committed to ensuring that homes and taxpayers ’ money are used to help only those in genuine need and will not tolerate people “ playing the system ” to their own benefit			0

@entity8 was entitled to housing benefit because she was *registered* as a single mother
she lived in a four bedroom house in @entity5 , near @entity11 , for about three years
*government* housing cap resulted in @entity144 moving family
@entity8 says she needs to live in the exclusive area so her children can get to school
@entity144 says it will now investigate the case
