by @entity0 while the venue for @entity2 seemed to be an open secret , the location for its sequel - @entity5 - still appears to be under wraps			0
but instead of jetting off to five - star luxury as predicted , it seems @entity9 and @entity10 have opted for something a little more modest to mark the start of their married life			2
with the media circus that 's surrounded their special day , the newlyweds fancied something rather more simplistic for their honeymoon - a campervan break in the countryside			1
just touched down in romance town ! the happy couple , @entity9 and @entity10 , waste no time posing for a trademark selfie to mark the start of @entity24 are we headed @entity26 or @entity27 , @entity28 ? the newlyweds wile away the first few hours of marital bliss by floating down a nearby river in a tandem canoe			1
could this honeymoon get any more romantic ? and the answer is yes ! @entity10 , famous for his rap lyrics , opts for a more starry - eyed tone as he serenades his new wife with the love - inspired lyrics he dreamed up on the water the incredible images showing lookalikes of @entity9 and @entity10 on their honeymoon were created by spoof photographer @entity43 to celebrate the launch of new @entity45 show @entity46 these incredible images show the loved - up couple wiling away the first few days of their honeymoon by canoeing down the river , singing love songs around the campfire and playing intimate games of @entity53 - while all the while donning their trademark bling			1
the pair look the epitome of happiness as they share a low - key picnic of strawberries and @entity61 , before they snuggle down together in their campervan , on a campsite that looks virtually - empty			0
but if you 're struggling to understand what has caused this sudden change in the collective @entity68 , take a closer look - because these pictures are n't quite what they seem			0
@entity43 , best know for her ' spoof ' productions of celebrities and royals , has been at it again , this time mocking up dozens of photos which show what the happy couple might get up to on their honeymoon to mark the start of new show @entity46 on the @entity45			1
using uncannily similar models , the photographer has given an alternative version of the @entity68 honeymoon - which , judging by their opulent wedding , is more likely to feature five star hotels and @entity61 on tap , rather than paddle boarding and @entity90			0
the hilarious photos depict the couple enjoying every day camping activities on their honeymoon			0
they show the pair cosying down for the night in their campervan - with @entity10 still sporting his trademark sunglasses as he tried to catch a bit of shut eye			2
the pictures also show @entity9 giving @entity10 a shave to make sure he is primed for the cameras , before she hangs out her wedding dress on the washing line			2
and in true @entity68 style , the pair make sure they record every moment of the treasured holiday , by stopping to pose for trademark selfies - which they no doubt posted onto @entity112			0
@entity46 is on @entity45 at 9pm weekdays until june 6			0
@entity9 gasps as @entity10 shakes the @entity61 and sprays it over his new wife in celebration of their marriage - likely to be the biggest extravagance of their otherwise low - budget honeymoon it might not be the seven courses featured on their wedding day , but @entity9 looks the picture of happiness as her husband romantically feeds her a juicy strawberry @entity9 ca n't resist making sure her husband is looking his scrubbed - up best , as she gives him a shave with a disposable razor and a lukewarm bowl of soapy water the campervan - which @entity10 tries to reverse into a tight space , pictured right - might be small ... but the @entity135 just does n't have the same charm @entity9 gets dressed into her best sports gears and dons her trademark gold bling as she takes on @entity10 in a swingball match - the epitome of romance could n't afford a speedboat ? @entity10 treats @entity9 to a boat ride in a plastic canoe - not quite the private jet they were shipped around in for their two - day wedding bonanza thank you , baby ! @entity10 ensures @entity9 feels comfortable as she hits the water in a bright pink lifejacket , stiletto heals and sparkling jewellery does my bum			1
. ? @entity9 wishes she was back in the @entity156 now as she glances behind to check her famous derriere looks its best in her white bikini do n't fall in ! @entity10 takes some time out of the hectic honeymoon schedule to enjoy a solo peruse along the river on his paddle board maybe i can save it for @entity26 ! @entity9 makes sure her wedding outfit is clean and fresh as she hangs it out to dry outside the couple 's lakeside campervan @entity10 urges his new wife to sit down and relax after the stress of the three - venue wedding party , which involved more than 600 guests			1

@entity10 and @entity9 tied the knot at *lavish* *ceremony* in @entity176 , @entity177 on *saturday* in front of 600 guests
now the pair have *escaped* the media circus to have a quiet , romantic honeymoon in the countryside ... or have they ?
@entity43 *imagined* the couple on honeymoon to mark the launch of new @entity45 show @entity46
