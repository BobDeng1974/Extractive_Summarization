by @entity0 last updated at 12:10 pm on 27th january 2012 the @entity3 government 's worst - case scenario at the height of the @entity6 nuclear crisis last year would have seen the evacuation of tens of millions of people and the capital @entity11 , a report has revealed			1
a 15 - page internal document , kept secret over fears of widespread panic , casts doubt on whether the @entity3 government was sufficiently prepared to cope with an evacuation on an unprecedented scale			1
it also adds to complaints in the country that the government withheld too much information about the world 's worst nuclear accident since @entity26			0
secret : evacuees crowd a check in at @entity30 , east of @entity11			2
a government report revealed 40million people may have had to flee if the worst case scenario hit the @entity6 power plant ghost town : an empty shopping street in @entity38 town , within the 20km @entity6 exclusion zone			1
if there had been a full meltdown at the plant , everyone within a 105 - mile radius would have to have been evacuated crippled : the number three reactor at @entity6 nuclear power plant , which was heavily damaged by the tsunami in january last year the report was submitted to then - prime minister @entity49 on march 25 , two weeks after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the @entity53 nuclear power plant , causing three reactors to melt down and generating hydrogen explosions that blew away protective structures			1
workers ultimately were able to bring the reactors under control , but at the time it was unclear whether emergency measures would succeed			2
mr @entity49 commissioned the report , compiled by the @entity3 @entity63 , to examine what options the government had if those efforts failed			1
authorities evacuated 59,000 residents within 12 miles of the @entity6 plant , with thousands more evacuated later from other towns			1
abandoned : wheelchairs left outside @entity72 after more than 50,000 people were evacuated from the vicinity of the @entity6 reactor damage : the tsunami in march last year caused catastrophic damage to the plant , resulting in the partial meltdown of two of the reactors deserted : weeds grow along the @entity84 train line in @entity86 town			1
those evacuated are still not able to return due to high radiation levels debris : a boat and a car are left at the side of the road after the massive wave smashed along the coastline following a 9 - magnitude quake the report looked at how the crisis could escalate - including explosions in the reactors , complete meltdowns and the structural failure of cooling pools used for spent nuclear fuel			2
it said that each contingency was possible at the time it was written , and that it would force workers to flee the vicinity and the situation at the plant would then deteriorate unmitigated			0
in that case , evacuation orders would have had to be issued for residents within a 105 - mile radius of the plant , and ' voluntary ' evacuation for everyone living with 155 miles			2
that area would have included @entity11 and its suburbs , with a population of 35 million people , and other major cities including @entity124 and @entity6			1
disaster : the 12 - mile exclusion zone around the @entity6 plant is still in place			2
it was home to 78,000 people when the tsunami hit the nuclear facility under control : last month , authorities announced that reactors at the @entity6 plant were in cold shutdown panic : people wait for buses in @entity11 after the massive earthquake in march last year			1
the government has been accused of hiding the scale of the @entity6 disaster the report further warned that contaminated areas would not be safe for ' several decades '			1
it said : ' we can not rule out further developments that may lead to an unpredictable situation at @entity53 nuclear plant , where there has been an accident , and this report outlines a summary of that unpredictable situation			0
' after mr @entity49 received the report , he and other @entity3 officials publicly insisted that there was no need to prepare for wider - scale evacuations			2
rumours of the document grew this month after media reports outlined its findings and an independent panel was created to investigate possible cover - ups			0
@entity170 , cabinet minister in charge of the nuclear crisis , acknowledged the document 's existence earlier this month , but said the government had felt no need to make it public			0
' it was a scenario based on hypothesis , and even in the event of such a development , we were told that residents would have enough time to evacuate , ' he said			0
' we were concerned about the possibility of causing excessive and unnecessary worry if we went ahead and made it public			0
' @entity3 authorities have been repeatedly criticised for how they handled information amid the unfolding nuclear crisis			0
officials initially denied that the reactors had melted down and were accused of playing down the health risks of radiation exposure			0
a radiation warning system , known as @entity196 , identified high - risk areas where thousands of people continued to live while the reactors were in critical condition			0
authorities did not use the data to order evacuations , claiming it was not accurate .			0

secret report reveals everyone within 105 miles of plant would have had to be evacuated in event of full meltdown
areas would have been contaminated with so much radiation they would not be safe for several decades
@entity3 government insisted there was no need to make plans for widespread evacuation after tsunami damaged @entity6 plant
entire population of @entity11 would have had to flee area if workers failed to control crippled reactors
