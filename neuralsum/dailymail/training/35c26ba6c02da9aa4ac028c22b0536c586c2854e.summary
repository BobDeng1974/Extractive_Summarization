@entity60 , the @entity61 mp for @entity62 who is chairing an inquiry into child exploitation , said agencies were being more pro-active in tackling exploitation nowadays			0
she told @entity75 : ' i think that child sexual exploitation has been under - identified for a very long time - part of the reason being that victims feel they are going to be blamed for what happened to them			0
' agencies are being much more proactive in going out and identifying children at risk of sexual exploitation and hopefully intervening before that sexual exploitation and the trauma that it causes children occurs			2
' she also said that with proper information being widely available , the public may become better at recognising the signs and symptoms of sexual exploitation in their own neighbourhood , making it easier for them to report children who are at risk			0
the issue of ' victim blaming ' by the agencies and authorities who were tasked to support the children had been ' a real problem for victims ' in the past , but ms @entity60 said this situation was now changing			0
she said : ' i do n't think the police can deal with this by themselves - that is why we need to engage the community			0
' according to the @entity117 , child sexual exploitation involves the manipulation or coercion of young people under the age of 18 into sexual activity in exchange for money , gifts , accommodation , affection or status .			0
