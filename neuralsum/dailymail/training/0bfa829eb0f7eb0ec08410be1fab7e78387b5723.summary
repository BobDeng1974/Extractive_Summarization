by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:06 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 : 15:52 est , 24 february 2014 @entity4 is an unconventional @entity5 : she wants president @entity6 removed from office and she 's happy to draw a @entity9 moustache on poster - size photos of him – and she 's eager to expose @entity13 bankers as the string - pullers behind everything that 's wrong with the world			1
she 's also running for the @entity17 as a @entity18 , and leading the pack			1
the state - wide party is n't amused			1
@entity22 ran for @entity23 in 2010 and 2012 and won the @entity25 primary both times , despite being trounced in both general elections by @entity28 rep. @entity28			1
in 2012 her campaign produced an @entity32 music video , set to the tune of the @entity34 hit ' supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ' – titled ' @entity36 ! ' it 's little wonder the @entity40 @entity25 establishment wants some distance			2
and the influential @entity68 ' have purposefully said she 's running in a different race than for @entity17			1
' ' the @entity40 [ @entity25 ] executive committee has passed resolutions condemning her candidacy and denying all support or acknowledgments , ' @entity71 said			2
' they are more committed to sinking with the ship than returning to the @entity79			0
' her coffers are almost empty , with barely $ 2,500 on hand and less than $ 27,000 in total donations			0
yet she leads the rest of the @entity25 field , according to a new @entity58 poll			2
the practical oddness of @entity22 ' platform , which also includes ' interplanetary defense ' and @entity91 colonization – so the @entity1 can shoot down asteroids approaching the earth – comes from her allegiance to @entity95 , a 91 - year - old conspiracy theorist who spent five years in federal prison for fraud in the early 2000s			1
@entity95 , she has said , is ' the world ’s leading economic forecaster			2
' he also claims to have invented the @entity103 , president @entity105 's proposed ' @entity104 ' missile shield program			0
conspiracy theorist @entity95 has attracted a global following of mostly young idealogues with his anti-establishment messages @entity22 does n't run from the @entity95 name , even though critics call him a cultist and a lunatic the perennial presidential candidate 's broader set of goals includes the restoration of the 1933 @entity118 , which prohibited commercial banks from doubling as investment speculators			1
he also wants to end the @entity122 's wiretapping programs and re-tune the world 's orchestras a hair lower than normal			0
@entity22 advocates for more @entity127 funding so it can engage in ' planetary defense ' by stationing missiles on the moon to intercept asteroids as they hurtle toward the earth @entity71 upped the ante from the concert hall by insisting that the @entity6 administration is ' supporting the swastika wearing @entity138 ' in @entity139			1
' this is putting us directly into a thermonuclear war confrontation with @entity143 , ' he said in an email			0
@entity22 has turned heads with her @entity9 - moustachioed @entity6 posters , as much as for her other ' far out stuff , ' columnist @entity145 told @entity67			1
' what can i say ? ' @entity145 shrugged			0
' @entity95 is a nut and he has a big following			2
often , when tea partiers are blamed for " @entity9 = @entity6 " signs , it 's actually the @entity156			0
' it was @entity145 who brought @entity22 a wave of perhaps unwanted attention on monday with an entry in his conservative @entity163 blog			0
the @entity165 , he noted , wrote that she ' has compared the @entity167 to 1930s - era nazi eugenics policies			0
' regarding the @entity34 cover tune , he insisted he was ' not making this up			0

african - american candidate polls *higher* than other @entity25 , but the party wants nothing to do with her
@entity4 is a *disciple* of @entity95 , a political conspiracy theorist who has spent time in prison for fraud
she wants the @entity1 to fund bases on @entity91 and the moon so missiles can intercept near - earth asteroids
@entity22 is polling above every other @entity18 in the @entity17 race for a seat held by @entity191 @entity190
