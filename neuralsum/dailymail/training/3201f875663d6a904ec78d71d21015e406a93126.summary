by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 11 june 2013 science minister @entity1 has called for @entity3 controls on @entity5 crops and food to be relaxed controls on ‘ @entity9 ’ crops should be slimmed down to clear the way for commercial cultivation , according to @entity13 ’s science minister			1
@entity1 , who has been heavily lobbied by @entity5 campaigners and scientists funded by the @entity5 industry , insists biotech crops could feed the world			1
mr @entity1 in the science department and the environment secretary , @entity20 , are pushing for @entity3 controls on new @entity5 crops and food to be relaxed			1
the move is at odds with the views of most @entity13 consumers , who are suspicious of the impact of @entity5 crops on human health and the environment			1
official research by the government ’s @entity32 ( @entity32 ) suggests shoppers actually want more information about @entity5 and how it is getting on to dinner tables by stealth			2
currently , a large part of the meat , milk and eggs in stores comes from farm animals fed a @entity5 diet , such as genetically modified soya and maize , however consumers are kept in the dark			1
ministers have ignored a recent @entity32 study which found that two in three people want any food derived from a animals fed on @entity5 to declare the fact on the label			1
mr @entity1 insisted that @entity3 controls on various new types of technology ranging from @entity5 crops and food to stem cell research and nanotechnology are far too restrictive			1
‘ we believe that @entity5 crops can help make agriculture more efficient , and also just as importantly more sustainable by , for example , reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels , ’ he said			1
‘ there are just too many 21st - century technologies that @entity74 is just being very slow to adopt ... one productive way forward is to have this discussion as part of a wider need for @entity74 to remain innovative rather than a museum of 20th century technology			0
’ uncertainties : but the majority of @entity13 consumers are suspicious about the impact of @entity5 crops on human health and want any food derived from animals fed a @entity5 diet to declare it on the label he added : ‘ by the time you ’ve added up the @entity93 overregulation of nanotechnology , the @entity101 judgment on stem cells ( where the @entity103 blocked a scientist from protecting his research with a patent ) , the fact that there is n’t a regime that would permit the use of innovative space vehicles , you ’re left with a great weight of regulation			1
’ @entity109 , who shared the @entity110 for his co-discovery of the structure of dna , also defended @entity5 ‘ the educated middle classes just do n’t like genetics , and now they do n’t want @entity5 food either because they ’re worried about safety , but the truth is it ’s probably safer , ’ he said			2
in 2011 , a team of doctors in @entity121 found that toxins implanted into @entity5 food crops to kill pests were reaching the bloodstreams of women and unborn babies			2
some 93 per cent of blood samples taken from pregnant women and 80 per cent of umbilical cords were positive for traces of the chemicals			0
it is not known what , if any , harm could be caused			0
eight governments have banned cultivation of a @entity139 @entity5 maize called @entity140 , which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it , on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects			0
the ban on the maize and other forms of @entity5 has been made under an @entity3 environmental protection provision known as the ‘ @entity150 ’			2
the eight are @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity93 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and most recently @entity158 , while @entity159 said it plans to follow suit			0
as a result , the @entity161 @entity5 giant @entity139 has effectively given up on lobbying to get approval for new @entity5 crops to be grown in @entity74			1
spokesman , @entity165 , said : ‘ we are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in @entity74			0
‘ currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops			0
the reason is , among other things , low demand of the farmers			0
’ this was confirmed by a spokesman for @entity176 , @entity177 , who said : ‘ we ’ve understood that such plants do n’t have any broad acceptance in @entity74 societies			0
it is counterproductive to fight against windmills			0
’ other @entity5 companies , such as @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 , have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in @entity74 .			2

@entity1 is calling for @entity3 controls on new @entity5 crops to be relaxed
the minister , who has been heavily lobbied by @entity5 campaigners , argues that the current regulations are too restrictive
but majority of consumers want more information on impact of @entity5 crops
much of the meat , milk and eggs in stores come from animals fed a @entity5 diet
