' you 've done alright ' : @entity1 , who has had 140 lovers , admired @entity4 's husband @entity3 on today 's @entity5 an @entity7 mother who has kept a diary detailing her sexual history with 140 men has said she could make room in her ' little black book ' for @entity3			1
@entity1 , 53 , from @entity13 , made the proposition as she was interviewed by the tv presenter and his wife , @entity4 , on today 's @entity5			1
speaking of how she has racked up so many lovers over the years , @entity1 said : ' i was kind of looking for a husband but it 's hard to get the qualities you want in one guy			1
' she added to @entity4 : ' you 've done alright			2
i might be able to make a little space sometime if you ever get tired of him			1
' an awkward - looking @entity3 quickly changed the subject to the viewers ' comments while an unflappable @entity4 asked @entity1 if she had ' commitment issues '			1
@entity1 said she has had so many lovers because she ' likes collecting things ' and keeping a diary of her conquests became a ritual			2
' i like to keep lists of things , it 's a habit			0
it might be a bit of @entity42 , ' she admitted			0
she explained how she slept with 140 men around the world - often just one night stands - as she travelled with her job as a translator			1
she started a list where she would rank them on their looks , dress sense and ' emotional state '			0
she would also keep a record of their ' solvency ' ( i.e how well - off they are ) and how long the relationship lasted			0
the 140 men have all been listed with a nickname such as ' @entity60 ' , ' @entity63 prince ' , ' blond photographer ' and alarmingly , ' @entity61 '			1
she said : ' some of them were permanent for a while but then i might move countries			0
' she added : ' they were often one night stands , never to be repeated just to put down in my " little black book "			0
' holding on to her man : @entity1 said she could make room for @entity3 in her ' little black book ' if @entity4 ever got tired of him @entity1 did marry and had children and her ex-husband scored 10/10 on her list - even though the marriage did n't last because he was ' mentally wrong '			1
she 's says she still on the hunt for ' @entity78 ' - although she does n't think a man that has all the qualities she wants actually exists			2
' i was n't going to settle for one person who did n't have all the qualities , ' she said			2
her diary is a way for her to keep track of the many men in her life and evaluate her relationships			2
ever the professionals : @entity3 and @entity4 on today 's @entity5 took @entity1 's comments in their stride scoring system : @entity1 rates her lovers on their looks , dress sense and solvency ' you can got back over and see what you 've got , ' she explained			1
' if they behaved themselves they might get an extra mark			0
' she added that it 's also helpful in allowing her to choose a suitable date for certain occasions			0
she said : ' the reason for the list and the score is you might be in the mood for someone who has good humour , but that person might not be solvent with a good car			0
' so if you want someone to take you to a show , you would go to that person			0
' when viewers suggested that @entity1 's list was sexist , she replied : ' i do n't know , if a man did this i think he would be , but i think a girl can get away with it			1
