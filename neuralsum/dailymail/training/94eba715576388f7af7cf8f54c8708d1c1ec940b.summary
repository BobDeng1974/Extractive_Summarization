by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 04:08 est , 15 october 2012 a campaign aimed at preventing bullying in schools across the @entity4 is being boycotted by a conservative @entity6 group that claims it promotes homosexuality among students			1
@entity10 , which sees schoolchildren encouraged to sit with fellow pupils they would n't normally spend time with , is designed to break up social cliques and stop students feeling isolated , organisers say			1
but the @entity17 , a conservative evangelical group , has branded the project a ' nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools '			1
mix it up : organisers of the event say it is designed to help break down social barriers and curb bullying in schools around 200 schools have cancelled plans to hold @entity30 on october 30 after the association e-mailed parents urging them to keep their children at home on the day of the event			1
@entity37 , from the @entity38 , which launched the programme 11 years ago , said the @entity6 group had lied to parents about the aims of the event and reverted to a ' cynical , fear - mongering tactic '			1
the @entity38 recently added the @entity17 - which describes itself as acting to ' restrain evil by exposing the works of darkness ' - to its national list of active hate groups , which also includes neo-nazis and @entity52 deniers			0
but @entity53 , director of issue analysis for the association , said it was not a hate group but rather ' a truth group '			0
he said that , while @entity59 does not specifically address homosexual students , the @entity38 promotes equal treatment for gay and lesbian pupils and that philosophy informs the event			1
' it 's just another thinly veiled attempt to promote the homosexual agenda , ' mr @entity53 told the @entity69			0
' no one is in favour of anyone getting bullied for any reason , but these anti-bullying policies become a mechanism for punishing @entity6 students who believe that homosexual behaviour is not something that should be normalised			0
' ' @entity79 ' : @entity53 has accused organisers behind @entity81 of trying to promote ' the homosexual agenda ' ms @entity37 , director of the @entity38 's @entity84 project , told the newspaper @entity85 was not about sexual orientation but rather about breaking up fixed social cliques , which can be especially evident in school cafeterias			2
she said pupils who are gay or perceived to be gay can often be on the receiving end of bullying at school , but insisted any suggestion the programme was intended as a means of homosexual indoctrination was totally wrong			2
' we â€™ve become used to the idea of lunatic fringe attacks but this one was complete misrepresentation , ' she said			0
only one of around 200 schools that have cancelled planned @entity104 agreed to comment			1
the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107 , said it decided to cancel because teachers were too busy trying to meet state teaching requirements , and not because it wanted to take a position on gay rights			0
' complete misrepresentation ' : the @entity38 said the @entity6 group had lied to parents about what @entity59 stands for the @entity116 in rural @entity117 is still planning to hold @entity118 for its 1,600 students , despite complaints from parents			2
headteacher @entity122 said the e-mail from the @entity17 described an event that bore ' absolutely no resemblance to what we do '			2
he said that once parents understood how the programme actually worked , they saw no reason not to allow their children to attend school			0
on @entity30 students are each assigned a number and then paired up by school officials to sit together at lunch time .			0
