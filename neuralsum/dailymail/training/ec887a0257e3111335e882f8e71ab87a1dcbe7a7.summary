by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter with the @entity4 facing massive overcrowding in its prisons , attorney general @entity3 today announced that the @entity7 will scale back the use of mandatory minimum prison terms for certain drug - related crimes			1
@entity3 said he would alter @entity7 policy so that low - level , nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to large - scale organizations , gangs or cartels wo n't be charged with offenses that impose those mandatory minimum sentences			1
@entity4 , he told a meeting of the @entity21 , will begin ' fundamentally rethinking the notion of mandatory minimum sentences for drug - related crimes			1
' while leaks of @entity3 's remarks made news monday morning , no major news outlet noted the racial component to what @entity3 announced			2
but @entity3 himself brought race to the front burner			2
should low - level drug offenders be sent for treatment instead of federal prison ? ' one deeply troubling report , released in february , indicates that – in recent years – black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes			1
this is n’t just unacceptable – it is shameful			2
' @entity3 said he had ' directed a group of @entity4 attorneys to examine sentencing disparities , and to develop recommendations on how we can address them			2
' his frank comments about race in the justice system will come as a surprise to some , and welcome news to others			2
@entity69 law professor @entity68 told @entity70 that ' there 's usually an eagerness in the government to avoid talking about the racial overlay in criminal justice policy			2
' ' but just as we saw the comments about @entity79 from the president , or attorney general @entity3 's willingness to give us a preview of this speech back in april when he spoke to @entity86 's @entity85 , these issues are necessarily more salient for an @entity87 ag serving an @entity87 - @entity4 president			2
' ' they grew up in communities of color , ' @entity89 said , ' places that are disproportionately affected by this kind of imprisonment and this kind of crime			0
' @entity98 , the director of the the @entity100 's @entity99 and the group 's senior vice president for policy and advocacy , said @entity3 's message is long overdue			0
race ' is a major component ' in the lack of fairness in sentencing laws , @entity106 told @entity70			1
' there 's a need for us to address these overly punitive measures , especially when there 's a racial component			0
' ending the @entity118 ? attorney general @entity3 is expected to announce a new policy scaling back mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders in an attempt to reduce @entity4 prison populations the nation 's dozens of federal prisoners are 40percent over-capacity			1
some 219,000 men and women are serving federal prison time , many of them drug offenders ' @entity132 addressed this ' by recalibrating the sentencing disparities in 2010 , ' @entity106 said , and ' they noted the racial differences in sentencing as well			1
' but differences in how blacks and whites are treated in federal courts , said @entity106 , ' affect too many people			1
racial disparities have a huge impact , but in addition we also have major disparities in income – in class			0
' ' we 're delighted that this issue is getting the attention it deserves			0
' some sort of reform is needed , says the @entity153 , even if it 's not informed by perceptions of racism			0
fully 60 per cent of federal drug offenders , the @entity153 notes , received mandatory minimum sentences in 2012			1
one - third of them were sentenced to 10 - year terms or longer			1
typically under federal law , crack cocaine users – most often black defendants – who possess only 28 grams of the drug are charged with felonies			1
meanwhile , historically white powder cocaine users are not charged with felonies unless they are caught with 500 grams			1
that 18 - to - 1 disparity was 100 - to - 1 until @entity132 acted in 2010			0
but incarceration at the federal level , say some , is still applied in a fashion that appears to play racial favorites			1
' as the so - called “ war on drugs ” enters its fifth decade , ' @entity3 said monday , ' we need to ask whether it , and the approaches that comprise it , have been truly effective – and build on the @entity181 ’s efforts , led by the @entity182 , to usher in a new approach			0
' ' some statutes that mandate inflexible sentences ... have had a destabilizing effect on particular communities , largely poor and of color , ' he added			0
and , applied inappropriately , they are ultimately counterproductive			0
' an estimated 9 to 10 million people - many of them arrested for drug possession - pass through local jails every year part of that dysfunction involves overcrowding in the federal prison system , which is now 40 per cent over capacity with 219,000 inmates.but some states have experimented with reforms that the federal government has noted with surprise			1
' in @entity202 , ' @entity3 said monday , ' investments in drug treatment for nonviolent offenders and changes to parole policies brought about a reduction in the prison population of more than 5,000 inmates last year alone			1
the same year , similar efforts helped @entity212 reduce its prison population by more than 1,400			1
' ' federal prosecutors , he explained , ' can not – and should not – bring every case or charge every defendant who stands accused of violating federal law			2
' @entity3 specifically noted the racial implications of the rule change and said ' people of color ' are often treated more harshly by the federal justice system devolving some cases to state or local law enforcers , he suggested , would free up federal government resources while also emphasizing community - level policing			2
it has become easier for the federal government to act , said @entity89 , the ohio state law professor , now that ' deep - red states like @entity202 , @entity233 , @entity234 – just to name a few – have been notably successful with these kinds of reforms			2
' ' i know the @entity7 has been emphasizing this in a number of way , but now it can be done properly , ' @entity89 told @entity70 , ' because it appears that this is what 's sensible regardless of your politics , and regardless of your perceptions of what 's " soft " or " hard " on drugs			0
' ' the evolving politics in the last five years have made this possible			0
' ' democrats are suddenly saying , much like the @entity250 have , that we trust the states to do this , ' @entity89 added			0
' i do n't think this represents a broader sense of the @entity257 administration being on board with cutting funds in @entity260 and putting power back in the states – like helping @entity263 remember which three cabinet departments to cut – but it does provide the @entity266 with a good opportunity to play nice with the right			0
' @entity269 , a former federal prosecutor in the @entity270 in @entity271 , @entity272 , told @entity70 that ' mandatory minimum sentences have ... unfairly targeted minorities ' and ' led to prosecutorial abuses , especially when law enforcement find a firearm anywhere remotely close to where drugs were found			1
' ' for example , if law enforcement stop a courier on the highway transporting drugs and agents also find a firearm somewhere in the vehicle , this courier would be facing not only a mandatory minimum of 10 years for the drug offense , he would also be facing a five year mandatory consecutive sentence for the firearm			1
' ' people of color often face harsher punishments than their peers			0
one deeply troubling report , released in february , indicates that – in recent years – black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes			1
this is n’t just unacceptable – it is shameful			0
' attorney general @entity3 on the racial implications of his decision aggressive enforcement of federal criminal laws is necessary , ' @entity3 said monday , ' but ' we can not simply prosecute or incarcerate our way to becoming a safer nation			1
' ' today , a vicious cycle of poverty , criminality and incarceration traps too many @entity4 and weakens too many communities			0
however , many aspects of our criminal justice system may actually exacerbate this problem , rather than alleviate it			0
' ' we need to ensure that incarceration is used to punish , deter and rehabilitate - not merely to convict , warehouse and forget , ' said the attorney general			0
@entity3 said mandatory minimum sentences ' breed disrespect for the system			1
when applied indiscriminately , they do not serve public safety			0
they have had a disabling effect on communities			0
and they are ultimately counterproductive			0
' senators @entity334 , an @entity336 @entity335 , @entity337 , a @entity338 @entity335 , @entity339 , an @entity340 @entity250 , and @entity341 , a @entity342 @entity250 , have introduced legislation aimed at giving federal judges more discretion in applying mandatory minimums to certain drug offenders			1
' we definitely need the bill passed , ' said @entity269 , the former federal prosecutor			2
' i would not rely on just the @entity7 's policy , because that 's very arbitrary , subject to change , and each district may apply it differently			0

most *frequent* mandatory minimum prison terms go to black offenders who use , *buy* or sell crack cocaine
white offenders typically use powder cocaine , which carries a much lower minimum prison term
mandatory minimum laws were launched during the 1980s ' @entity118 ' but federal prisons are now 40 per cent over capacity
