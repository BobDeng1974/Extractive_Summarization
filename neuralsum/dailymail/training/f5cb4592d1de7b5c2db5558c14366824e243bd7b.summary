the most senior @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 has lambasted the prime minister for his ‘ un-democratic ’ and ‘ orwellian ’ plans to legalise gay marriage			1
archbishop of westminster @entity6 said the proposals were a ‘ shambles ’ , and accused @entity9 of pushing through the changes without a mandate			1
in his @entity13 at @entity14 , he said that only marriage between a man and a woman shares in ‘ the creative love of @entity19 ’			2
protest : the archbishop of westminster @entity6 wants @entity0 to write to their mps expressing their concerns about gay marriage plans the criticism follows that of the @entity25 of @entity26 , @entity27 , who used his @entity13 homily to liken moves to legalise same - sex marriage to the way @entity32 and @entity33 tried to undermine religion			1
mr @entity9 wants to allow gay couples to get married in churches but he says religious organisations will be able to opt out			2
archbishop @entity38 criticised successive governments for failing to stand up for marriage and promoting sex before marriage instead			1
in an interview with the @entity44 , he attacked parties who were promoting same - sex marriage , saying the plan was ‘ orwellian ’ because there was no mandate from the public			1
‘ from a democratic point of view , it ’s a shambles , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity54 would be proud of the manoeuvre			1
i think the process is shambolic			2
’ the archbishop ’s comments come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry			1
opposition : the most senior @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 described the plans as ' orwellian ' criticism : catholics must act to try and change the minds of politicians throughout the @entity68 the @entity69 has sought to heal relations with @entity71 as he asked for blessings for the communist leadership for the first time in his @entity76 message			1
but speaking in @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity78 also urged the regime to respect religion			2
it follows a row two weeks ago when the @entity85 refused to accept @entity71 ’s decision to revoke the title of a @entity89 bishop			0
asking for @entity71 ’s leaders to ‘ esteem the contribution of the religions ’ , the @entity69 said it would help build a ‘ fraternal society for the benefit of that noble people ’			1
he also spoke against the slaughter of the ‘ defenceless ’ in @entity98 , and urged @entity99 and @entity100 to find the courage to negotiate			0
turning to the nations of the @entity103 , he urged that they build just and respectful societies , especially @entity106			0
the 85 - year - old also prayed for peace in @entity109 and in @entity110 , where , he said ‘ savage acts of terrorism continue to reap victims , particularly among @entity114 ’			0
civil partnerships – which come with most , but not all , of the legal safeguards of marriage – were introduced seven years ago			0
they allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings , but not in religious buildings			0
now the government wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious settings			1
religious organisations such as the @entity128 and the @entity129 have said they would like to be able to host gay marriages			0
but the @entity131 and @entity0 are against it and the legislation says it would be illegal for any @entity131 vicar to marry a gay couple			0
ministers insist that churches will never be forced to carry out gay marriage , but opponents say homosexual couples could get the ban overturned under @entity143 human rights laws			0
last week pope @entity78 reiterated his opposition to gay marriage , saying that it was destroying the very ‘ essence of the human creature ’			0
outgoing archbishop of canterbury @entity149 admitted yesterday that the rejection of women bishops had damaged the @entity131			1
in his last @entity76 sermon , he said last month ’s @entity155 vote had been ‘ deeply painful ’			0
but he argued believers should take heart from the fact more than half the population – 59 per cent – describe themselves as @entity160 in the most recent census .			0

archbishop of @entity164 says @entity123 has no mandate for law
