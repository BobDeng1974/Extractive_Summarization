when a policeman noticed driver @entity2 sipping a @entity3 in a traffic jam , he could have let her off with a simple lecture on road safety			1
but instead he handed her a £ 100 fine and three penalty points – after calling three colleagues on his radio for back - up			1
account manager @entity12 , 22 , was on her way to lunch with a friend in @entity16 , @entity17 , when she got stuck in a traffic jam			1
pulled over : ms @entity2 was driving her convertible @entity19 at 11.30am last friday when she sipped the drink she took a sip of her raspberry @entity3 drink while she was waiting , and thought nothing of it			1
but a policeman passing on a bike spotted her and called in three more officers – one on a bike and two in a van			1
he then gave her a £ 100 fixed penalty fine for driving without due care and attention			0
miss @entity2 , from @entity35 , @entity17 , said : ‘ it ’s so petty and ridiculous			1
it was only a tiny sip			0
i was n’t even moving			0
and talk about overkill – to have four police officers dealing with such a petty thing is a joke			2
’ after having been a driver for four years without so much as a parking fine , miss @entity2 was nabbed with the ice drink in her @entity19 convertible at 11.30am last friday			1
she vowed to appeal after also getting three penalty points on her previously clean licence			0
a spokesman for the @entity48 said : ‘ any person who believes they have been unjustly issued with a fixed penalty notice has the right to appeal against this through the courts			0
’ the law does not specify whether eating or drinking while driving is illegal , and whether drivers have committed by doing so depends on how it affected their driving			0
according to advice from the @entity60 , drinking a soft drink while on the road is only an offence ' if you present a significant danger ' and if the police think ' you are not in proper control of the vehicle			2
a study from @entity70 has shown that drivers consuming drinks at the wheel went 22 per cent more slowly than average , but were also 18 per cent more likely to show erratic lane control			0
guidelines published by the @entity76 do not mention food or drink in relation to driving without due care and attention - but they mention that any act which causes a driver to be ' avoidably distracted ' could constitute an offence			2
this is in contrast to more specific laws which exist around other potential distractions such as mobile phones - the use of which attracts an instant penalty .			0

@entity2 , 22 , was still in @entity17 traffic when she took a sip
a passing officer spotted her drinking the raspberry - *flavoured* iced drink
he called three other policemen for backup and handed out the fine
ms @entity2 has *slammed* her ' petty and ridiculous ' *treatment* by officers
