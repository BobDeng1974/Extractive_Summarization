by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 as @entity3 builds towards a crescendo across @entity5 a warning comes from arguably the greatest player of them all			1
@entity8 , watching what he describes as ‘ a completely different sport ’ to the one he once played with distinction , believes that @entity12 remains the favourite for the title this year			1
' i saw a lot of his match against @entity18 on monday , he is just so tough and consistent off the ground , ' says the 75 - year - old @entity21 legend			1
no 1 : @entity12 ( above ) is @entity8 's favourite to win this year 's @entity5 ' his serve also seems to me to have more on it than it did last year , so he is the guy i would pick , although any of the top four could do it			1
' @entity8 is eagerly anticipating wednesday ’s quarter - final between @entity28 and @entity29 , but reckons the improvements in the @entity28 game from the past two years will probably see him through			1
' before he joined up with @entity32 he was patting the ball back too much , but @entity28 listened and now he is taking it to his opponents more			2
i would still like to see him at the net more than he is			0
' i think @entity29 is going to be a great player , he has all the shots			2
but if @entity28 is n’t making any errors , that ’s going to create a lot of pressure			2
' changes : @entity8 believes tennis is ' a completely different sport ' to the one he once played while @entity8 has the @entity47 equivalent named after him at the @entity48 , he is happy sitting in the members ’ seats at the @entity51 , and occasionally the @entity52			1
he was among the many who noticed @entity54 sitting there on monday decked out in uniform			0
' was it a military outfit or something ? ' asks the famously mild - mannered @entity8 , who in his new autobiography singled out @entity54 as one of the very players he struggled to get along with			1
' @entity54 has never seemed to care if he is hurting other people , he has that way about him			0
he thinks it ’s all funny			0
he would get angry and do things to denigrate the crowd or be rude to women umpires			0
i ended up asking not to have to play against him when i played exhibitions or veterans ’ matches			0
' @entity8 went on long enough at the highest level to be reaching the last eight of big tour events at 37 , and on that basis believes that @entity77 has ‘ maybe two years ’ left at the top			1
yet he concedes that the game he played is so utterly different to the one he watches now , however much he still enjoys it			0
rivalry : @entity54 ( pictured ) ' never seemed to care if he is hurting people ' according to @entity8 ' it ’s so much tougher these days , when i was playing tournaments in @entity86 sometimes my first - round opponent would be a county player , not the quality they have to face now			1
' the biggest difference is the rackets and strings			0
i always get asked how i would fare against today ’s top players but it ’s impossible to say because of that			2
' only if i had played with a composite racket from the age of eight or ten could you try and judge it			0
someone like @entity103 , he gets so much spin on the ball it ’s almost impossible for him to overhit			0
back in the day : @entity8 was ranked as world no 1 for seven consecutive years ' i was five feet eight and a half and @entity110 was five feet seven			1
if i played @entity112 now , his kick serve into the advantage court would be going four feet over my head			0
' i regret that the small man is now excluded from becoming a top player unless they have something very special about them , but i do think the modern game is great to watch			2
' i also think the top four players in this era are of the highest quality we have seen			2
there was myself , @entity110 and @entity126 for a time in the sixties but the depth is not the same			0
' * @entity8 : an autobiography is published by @entity130 , £ 16.99 next step : @entity28 faces @entity29 in the @entity5 quarter - final on wednesday			1

tennis legend @entity8 believes @entity12 is in pole position to win @entity5
@entity8 believes the no 1 seed will take some stopping , but ' any of the top four can win it '
