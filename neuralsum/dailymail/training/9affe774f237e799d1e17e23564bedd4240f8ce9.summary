' that day it was not him out there on the court			0
i think we all know that			0

' it just happened for me on that day to really play good			0
i used every single mistake that he did			0

@entity0 is bidding to avenge his defeat to @entity30 's @entity65 in the quarter - finals of @entity8 last summer @entity0 worked hard in the searing heat but will find conditions more to his liking against @entity70 @entity0 's coach @entity71 watches attentively as her charge takes a vollet close to the net ' i think he has a lot to look forward to			1
i think adding up the new ( coaching ) team , i think it 's all fresh			2
i think it 's going to give him a bit more excitement to compete , which i 'm certainly aware of			2
' but at the same time , i feel that i 'm pretty stable around me as well			0
i think the only thing i can do is get out there and play my tennis			0

i 'm always excited to play against him			0
i always like that kind of challenge			0
i think physically and mentally i 'm ready to play that match and really give 100 per cent			2
' we always had good battles			0
we know how we play , so there 's no secrets out on the court , which in a way is nice to have			2
at least you know what to expect			0
i think it 's going to come down to those kind of little moments that we can use			0
' @entity0 has yet to drop a set in @entity2 and needed just over two hours to beat @entity104 's @entity103 6 - 1 6 - 1 7 - 5 in the third round			1
