by @entity1 reporter published : 09:20 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 19:23 est , 2 july 2012 a student has graduated from @entity3 with first class honours – having sat her final exams only 28 hours after having a baby			1
@entity7 , 33 , had to leave daughter @entity8 in intensive care while she sat her practical criticism paper in her dressing gown and slippers in hospital			1
she then completed her @entity14 and the @entity16 tragedies exam the next day in the hospital			2
bright spark : @entity7 said she was ' fixed ' on completing her @entity3 @entity20 degree , despite being heavily pregnant with her first child , @entity21 despite the exhaustion of labour and the final weeks of her pregnancy , she secured a first class honours degree in @entity20 from the @entity3 ’s @entity27			1
yesterday she admitted giving birth and sitting her finals in the same couple of days was ‘ slightly insane ’			0
she said : ‘ i wonder how i held it together and got through them because now i ’m into full - blown “ nappy brain ”			0
while my concentration and memory were not as good as they might have been , i could still do things i needed to do and retain enough information to write decent essays			0
‘ at the time it seemed like a perfectly legitimate thing to do but now i look back and think it ’s slightly insane			0
’ miss @entity7 , a former dancer from @entity3 , turned down the opportunity to study at the city ’s university when she finished her a-levels			1
double first : @entity3 super-student @entity7 , 33 , with newborn baby @entity8 , to whom she gave birth just 28 hours before sitting her final exams top priority : @entity7 's @entity21 , pictured at just a few hours old , was always the talented student 's number one priority but she later took up a place to study @entity20 at @entity27			1
she said the pregnancy in her final year was a ‘ total surprise ’			0
she was offered the chance to apply for a @entity59 – ‘ deemed to have deserved honours ’ – instead of attempting her exams , but she decided to go ahead			2
‘ maybe i was being desperately obsessive but i knew whatever happened i should be able to get a better result than what the university would give me if i did n’t take the paper , ’ she said			0
she added that she hoped the baby , like many first - borns – would come late			2
but a scan showed @entity8 may have had a digestive tract disorder so doctors at @entity72 arranged for @entity7 to be induced			1
new beginnings : high - achiever @entity7 plans to take six months off work to care for @entity8 , before continuing in further academic study she was born weighing 6lb10oz after a difficult labour			1
twenty - eight hours later , at 2pm on may 24 , @entity7 sat her exam			1
she said : ‘ i was sitting in a hospital room in my gown attached to a catheter			2
i was feeling quite bruised and it was very painful to sit for three hours			0
’ yesterday mother and baby were fit and well and resting at home			0
‘ i am really lucky , ’ she added			0
‘ @entity8 is doing well and i ’ve managed to get the degree i wanted			1
’ dr @entity86 , senior tutor at @entity27 , said : ‘ what @entity87 has achieved is a phenomenal result – to gain a first class honours on such a tough course , under such remarkable circumstances			0
’ now miss @entity7 plans to pursue her interest in writing plays and spend time with baby @entity8 and husband @entity96 , 28 , a phd composition student			1
