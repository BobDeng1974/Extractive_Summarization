by @entity0 published : 02:56 est , 4 april 2012 updated : 06:38 est , 4 april 2012 the school photograph is meant to be a cherished memento which lets families remember their child 's formative years			1
but when this class of second grade elementary school students in @entity9 look at their class picture , they are unlikely to enjoy the memories quite so much			0
their group picture became an ' offensive and degrading ' photograph when one of the pupil 's heads was bizarrely replaced with a brown cartoon face			1
badly taken : the second grade class photo from @entity20 ( other pupils obscured ) shows a boy on the front row whose identity is covered by a bizarre brown smiley face the unidentified pupil at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity9 , was subjected to the ' humiliating ' photoshop treatment instead of being removed from the picture			1
photographer @entity32 's company @entity31 were commissioned to take the school picture , but were told shortly after by the local @entity34 that two children had to be removed from the image as their parents had not signed a consent form			1
mr @entity32 told @entity9 's @entity39 that he was able to remove one child completely from the picture , but could not do so with the other student as he was sat on the front row			2
the @entity34 instead amazingly advised him to obscure the child 's identity by placing a brown ' smiley face ' over his head			1
officials at @entity20 's pta would not confirm who was to blame for the photographic blunder the resulting image has been branded ' offensive ' and ' degrading ' , with one parent at the school telling local 10 the boy would have felt ' humiliated ' by the picture			2
school officials would not confirm whether the pupil still attended @entity58			0
a district spokeswoman in @entity28 told local 10 the picture was an ' oversight ' , but would not confirm who was to blame for the image			0
@entity32 and school officials said incidents do occasionally occur when children have to be removed from pictures after they are taken when it transpires their parents have not signed consent forms			0
mr @entity32 , who has taken school pictures for 37 years , said despite the bizarre alteration to the image , he received 14 orders for the photo			0
the class photo will be retaken and parents given free copies if they ordered the first attempt			0
the @entity34 for @entity58 said in a statement : ' the @entity34 notified photographer after finding out that a child did n't have a signed media release form from the parent			1
@entity82 covered the child 's face using an inappropriate sticker			1
the @entity34 disagrees with how the photography company handled it and worked with the photographer to have the picture retaken this thursday			2
immediate action was taken on behalf of the @entity34			0
we love and protect our children			0
