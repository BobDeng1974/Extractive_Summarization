by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 25 november 2013 an overweight student was shamed into losing eight stone after getting wedged in a lecture seat on her first day of university			1
@entity5 , 20 , from @entity6 , weighed 17st 5lbs when she started law school at the @entity8 after years of gorging on takeaways , chocolate and crisps			1
she was a dress size 24 and was mortified when she attended her first lecture last september and found herself wedged in her seat when it was time to leave			1
slimmed down : @entity5 lost 8st in 11 months , left , after she once tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs she was forced to wait while fellow students climbed over her to leave before she could wriggle herself free			1
she recalls : ' i was just stuck in the arm bits on my hip area , i had the table bit in front of me to lean on , there was not a huge gap			0
i was making excuses trying to pack my stuff away as slowly as possible so it did n't look like i was stuck			0
' people were a bit confused as to what i was doing and the fact i was telling them to climb over me , i did n't know anyone so it was really embarrassing			1
wake - up call : the law student 's diet used to consist mainly of chocolate and takeaways and she was mortified when she once got stuck in a chair ' luckily there was n't another lecture coming in afterwards so i had enough time to prise myself out			1
' i stopped going to university for weeks after it happened i was so embarrassed , i missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work , it was awful			0
' the humiliation in september left the aspiring lawyer determined to slash her daily intake of calories and turn her life around			0
' i stopped going to university for weeks after it happened i was so embarrassed , i missed out on making all my friends and a lot of work , it was awful ' she said of her weight : ' it stopped me making a lot of friends during my first year , i did n't socialise at all really			0
' it took a while but i finally decided i could n't hide in my room and do nothing , i needed to go back and do something about it			0
' she used to binge on chocolate , bagels , crisps and croissants before school , followed by more chocolate and sandwiches for lunch			2
after school she would tuck into yet more crisps before going home for a generous helping of a home - cooked dinner with yet more chocolate from a stash in her room			2
to add to her woes , @entity5 would often eat takeaways and kebabs because her mother 's former partner hated cooking			1
diet overhaul : @entity5 swapped her calorific snacks for fruit and dropped from a dress size 24 to 8 but since swapping calorie - crammed snacks for salads , fruit and a healthy breakfast after joining @entity103 , @entity5 has trimmed inches off her waist			1
she lost 12lbs in the first week of her diet which she said helped to motivate her to stick with it even though she admits ' it was a bit hard at first to get things in moderation			2
' but she stuck with it and continued to slim down losing eight stone in 11 months			1
she 's now 9st 5lbs , a dress size 8 , bringing her total weightloss to eight stone			1
she 's now also started exercising to keep the weight off			0
changed woman : @entity5 is now also exercising to keep the weight off and has never felt better she said : ' i did n't exercise while i was losing weight but i now doing fitness training			2
i have a personal trainer twice a week and i go to the gym twice a week too			0
' the student said the weightloss has boosted her confidence and has also helped the rest of her family get in shape - her grandparents and mother have all lost weight as a result of her new healthy eating regime			0
@entity5 said : ' it 's so good to finally get back to ' normal ' again			2
i feel a lot better , i can wear dresses and skirts now which is amazing , before i just wore a lot of baggy tops			0
