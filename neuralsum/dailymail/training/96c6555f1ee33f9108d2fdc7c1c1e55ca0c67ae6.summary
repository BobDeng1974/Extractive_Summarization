the helmsman was knocked off his feet by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel , leaving it ' buckled ' and impossible to steer			1
he suffered a suspected broken jaw , putting him out of action and forcing him to join the ill crew below deck			1
watch the rescue below rescue operation : a lifeboat comes to the aid of a novice yacht crew who got into difficulties after their captain allegedly ignored their concerns and continued sailing into a force 10 storm off the @entity34 coast some were left with hypothermia as the vessel , called @entity38 , became stricken in winds of up 55mph off the coast of @entity42 , @entity34 , the trial was told			1
it led to the yacht making a @entity46 call to the coastguard , indicating an ' imminent emergency '			1
despite the chaos , the skipper believed he had everything ' under control ' , it was alleged			1
eventually , they were plucked to safety by coastguard helicopter and two rnli lifeboats			0
but attempts to tow the @entity61 40.7 yacht to port were hampered when the rope snapped twice and later ripped off its anchor point , the court heard			2
video : rookie yacht crew rescued in rough seas after sailing into @entity9 storm ' @entity69 ignored warnings ' : five of the crew were so seasick after being tossed around in 20ft waves they were unable to man the £ 105,000 pounds race cruiser , called @entity38 , a court heard a lifeboat man who risked his life leaping onto the stricken vessel to help with the rescue was later commended for his bravery			1
the cruiser was skippered by @entity82 , 51 , and owned by @entity83 , under the sole directorship of @entity85 , 36			1
@entity82 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , denies four charges of failing to discharge his duties properly as a ship 's master , contrary to the @entity92			1
it is alleged the ' manner of his acts or omissions caused or were likely to cause loss , destruction , death or injury '			1
manning , from @entity101 , @entity102 , denies three charges of failing to discharge a duty , contrary to the same act			2
liquid @entity38 was heading downwind from @entity11 , @entity102 , to @entity106 , @entity34 , when the fiasco started			0
it left the marina two hours late at 2.30pm on january 2 this year , heading east along the south coast on an overnight trip			2
' lives put in danger ' : the trial heard that the helmsman was knocked off his feet by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel , leaving it ' buckled ' and impossible to steer this was despite the weather forecast that morning warning : ' storm force ten ( winds ) expected later '			1
force ten winds hit 63mph and whipped up foam - capped waves of 41ft , with an over-hanging crest			0
on land , such gusts would be strong enough to uproot trees			0
furthermore , the vessel was not equipped with an illuminated compass for nighttime sailing and had no way of measuring its speed , the court heard			1
it carried ' storm sails ' intended for use in strong winds but the crew failed to use them			2
@entity82 was joined on board by his daughter and five adult novices who had paid £ 225 each for the trip , which was due to last four days and take them to the @entity147			1
in fact they were rescued just 15 hours after setting sail			0
many of the crew had little more than the most basic sailing qualifications and were trained to sail in ' familiar waters ' during the day			2
when some of the crew expressed their concerns about sailing at night in bad weather , they were ignored , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity160 , representing the @entity161 , said @entity82 and @entity85 were responsible for a number of safety breaches			2
she said : ' the morning the crew assembled , a shipping forecast was issued at 10.30am which said ' southwest , storm @entity9 expected later '			0
' that information was available to them before the voyage began and indicated the weather that was expected after 7pm that evening			0
' both @entity82 and @entity85 would have known there were gale force ten warnings in the period the vessel was going to be at sea had it gone all the way to @entity106			1
' they should have taken the decision at that point not to embark on the journey			0
' the court heard that two hours into the journey another forecast repeated the storm warnings , which were also ignored			0
accused : skipper @entity82 ( left ) denies four charges of failing to discharge his duties properly as a ship 's master , contrary to the @entity92 , while the sailing school 's director @entity85 ( right ) has pleaded not guilty to three counts of failing to discharge a duty , contrary to the same act miss @entity160 said : ' at this time , they were still in the @entity197 , coming out			1
' it was not quite dark and there were many choices available to the skipper			0
he could have turned back or headed to a port of refuge , which he did not do			0
' it would have been an uncomfortable return to @entity11 but they would have had the shelter of the @entity210			0
after a three hour straight sail they could have been safely back at home			0
' by not exercising his judgement , @entity82 put the vessel , those on board and third parties - including the rescue teams - at risk of loss , destruction or personal injury			1
and that is what happened			0
' he ignored the weather and ports of refuge until he was left with no option but to plough on			0
' miss @entity160 said the crew had expressed their own concerns about the weather and the journey prior to setting sail but they were ignored			2
she said : ' the crew stated at a briefing before they set sail that they had limited experience			0
prosecutor @entity160 ' they were told the voyage would be sailing straight through the night unless there was a reason to go into port			1
' the crew was surprised at this and expressed their views			0
' furthermore , one inquired about the incoming bad weather and did suggest ports of refuge along the way			0
these suggestions were not taken up by @entity82 because he was keen to press on			2
' the court was played a recording of the vessel 's @entity259 call in which the coastguard was told five of the crew had gone down with sea sickness			1
a @entity46 call about an hour later , at 6.21am , told the coastguard the helmsman had possibly broken his jaw after falling on the wheel			1
their calls prompted a rescue operation , in which the helmsman and several crew were winched to safety and taken to hospital			0
miss @entity160 said : ' the coastguard took the decision to launch the @entity279			0
however , @entity82 did not feel that a lifeboat was necessary			2
' despite the diminished number of functioning crew , he felt everything was under control			2
' @entity38 was towed to @entity106 harbour			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
