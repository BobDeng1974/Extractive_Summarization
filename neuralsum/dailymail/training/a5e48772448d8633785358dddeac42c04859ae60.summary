by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 19:21 est , 4 march 2014 detained : @entity2 , deputy director of the no 10 policy unit , was arrested by officers of the @entity5 almost three weeks ago the @entity5 , dubbed ‘ @entity7 ’s @entity6 ’ , was plunged into a major secrecy row last night after it refused to comment on its arrest of a top @entity11 aide			1
senior officials at the agency maintained total silence on the controversial detention of @entity2			1
@entity17 ’s trusted advisor was spirited away in the middle of the night when officers knocked on the door of his @entity22 home			1
but in an extraordinary move , the fledgling agency said it would not ‘ confirm or deny ’ its involvement in any ‘ on - going investigation ’			2
this unprecedented declaration hides the fact that hundreds of criminal suspects are being deprived of their liberty in secret			2
the @entity33 can reveal that only a tiny proportion of the 350 people arrested by the agency since it opened its doors last october have received any publicity			2
and this ultra-secrecy stands in stark contrast to every other police force in @entity7 and recently released official guidance			1
police forces will always confirm if an arrest has been made and leaders at the @entity47 state this is clearly in the public interest			0
they have gone on to add that forces can also identify suspects if there is a policing purpose , for example reassuring the public or tracing other offenders			0
it is understood the @entity5 policy was shaped by the @entity59 , which included a raft of proposals to rein in the @entity62			2
but it once again highlights concerns that the inquiry into press standards is enabling police and other officials to withhold key information from the public			0
it leaves @entity5 director general @entity72 , who once pledged to be open and transparent , vulnerable to accusations of leading the ‘ secret police ’			1
on his appointment by home secretary @entity76 , mr @entity72 said he would not repeat the mistakes of his predecessors at the @entity79 , known as @entity79			0
the former @entity81 chief constable said crime - fighters could not complain about criticism if they failed to tell people what they were doing			0
@entity87 secrecy : the faces of the @entity5 officers seen here taking part in a training exercise in @entity93 were pixelated at the request of the newly formed agency 's press team his predecessor , former @entity99 chief sir @entity97 , gained a reputation for extreme secrecy after openly boasting about @entity79 ’s closed doors			1
the secrecy row is particularly difficult for mr @entity72 because both mrs may and mr @entity17 have called on police chiefs to be open about who they arrest			1
@entity5 chief @entity72 , who once pledged to be open and transparent , is now vulnerable to accusations of leading the ' secret police ' they have both said there should be a ‘ working assumption ’ in favour of not only confirming arrests , but identifying suspects			1
last year mr @entity72 ’s former force was criticised after refusing to name a retired police officer charged with stealing £ 113,000 from its headquarters			0
@entity121 was forced into a humiliating u-turn amid a national outcry at what some suspected was an attempt to protect their own			0
questions also remain over why the explosive allegations against @entity129 were reported directly to the @entity5 , and not @entity130			1
@entity132 officials are in regular contact with a @entity135 sergeant based in @entity136 who is responsible for their security			0
the @entity139 has its own child abuse investigation command which has been responsible for thousands of successful inquiries			0
but @entity143 insiders suggested that senior officials may have lost confidence in the force over the damaging ‘ @entity150 ’ row which led to the resignation of chief whip @entity149			0
one official said the prime minister ’s closest advisors may have been ‘ more comfortable ’ dealing with the @entity5 , whose creation was a @entity156 manifesto pledge			1
asked if police should confirm if an arrest has been made , a @entity47 spokesman replied : ‘ absolutely , that is in the public interest and is in our guidance			2
’ but an @entity5 spokesman said it is not ‘ appropriate or practical ’ to publicise every arrest , and that the agency must balance ‘ transparency ’ with ‘ operational integrity ’			1
‘ we also need to consider the right to a fair trial and the risk of jeopardising a prosecution in the event that charges are brought , ’ the spokesman added			0
‘ an individual who has not been charged , and may still be released without charge , should reasonably expect to have their details made public only when law enforcement has the evidence to bring charges			0

few of the hundreds arrested by @entity5 have been named
its ultra secrecy is a stark contrast to official guidance calling for openness
and it has left the agency open to accusations of being @entity7 's ' secret police '
@entity5 officers arrested @entity2 at his home in the middle of the night
there are questions as to why he was not reported to @entity130
