@entity1 's sun safety has been slipping with a new survey revealing that 430,000 more adults are getting sunburnt on the weekend than they were four years ago			1
the findings , from @entity6 's @entity5 which looked at the sun protection habits of 5000 @entity1 adults , estimated that about 2.4 million people are getting sunburnt on an average summer 's weekend across the country			2
@entity12 , @entity6 's @entity13 and an expert on skin cancer prevention , told @entity16 that the reason for the increase in complacency for excessive exposure to @entity21 was due to a lack of national skin cancer awareness campaigns			1
the @entity6 's @entity5 looked at the sun protection habits of 5000 @entity1 adults ' we have n't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years , so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact , ' mr @entity12 said			2
' we know our cancer campaigns are effective in motivating behaviour change , particularly in people covering their body and hat wearing			0
' there is a direct correlation and this data is clearly a call to action for more government investment in public campaigns			0
' mr @entity12 said that the government had an incentive to raise awareness through prevention programs , as sun cancer leads to almost one million doctor visitations each year			1
@entity46 cancer leads to almost one million doctor visitations each year and more than 11 thousand @entity1 are diagnosed with melanoma each year ' @entity46 cancer is the most expensive burden of all cancers , ' he said			1
' in terms of cost to the public health system , but also in terms of human costs : the 11 thousand plus @entity1 who are getting diagnosed with melanoma each year			0
' the survey also found that men were more likely to get sunburnt than women and neglect protecting their skin , with 18 per cent getting sunburnt on the weekend compared to 12 per cent of women			0
' we have n't had a national sun protection campaign for over five years , so part of this reason for the increase could be very well attributed to this fact , ' @entity12 , @entity6 's @entity13 and an expert on skin cancer prevention , said ' we ca n't explain that exactly , maybe it 's because they spend more time outdoors than women , maybe they 're more inclined to wear less or have less regard for skin protection , ' mr @entity12 said			1
' but it is a concern as it will undoubtedly lead to higher melanoma rates for men than women			0
' the @entity6 encourages people to minimise their uv exposure by wearing appropriate clothing and sunscreen and recognising that the first signs of sunburn can occur within 15 minutes in the sun.			0
