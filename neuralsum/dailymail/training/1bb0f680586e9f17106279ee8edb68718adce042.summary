@entity0 , who developed a life threatening wound infection , pictured with her son @entity3 the birth of her first son @entity3 in september 2012 should have brought nothing but joy to @entity0			1
instead , it left the 30 - year - old barmaid from @entity10 in @entity11 fighting a life - threatening infection as the wound from her emergency caesarean became infected with the drug - resistant superbug @entity15			1
even though she was given the most powerful antibiotics available , underwent surgery to remove the infected tissue and even had maggot therapy ( where the disinfected fly larvae are used to clean the wound ) , six weeks later nothing had improved			1
her doctors said it was one of the worst cases of @entity15 infection they had ever seen			1
' i thought i was going to die , ' recalls @entity0 , who lives with her partner and @entity3 's father @entity29 , a 32 - year - old chef			1
' i was really scared			2
i was in so much pain and so feverish i could n't even cuddle @entity3			0
i felt like a freak , and the wound was so badly infected you could smell it several feet away			1
' yet just six weeks later the infection had completely healed			1
as unlikely as it sounds , @entity0 insists that the solution was a pair of pyjamas she bought for £ 49.99			1
the pyjamas were made from fabric with fine strands of copper running through it			1
copper has a long history as an anti-bacterial agent			0
in @entity49 , copper salts were used as wound dressings by the @entity51			1
@entity53 and @entity54 sailors used to place a copper coin in their drinking water to prevent it fouling during long voyages			0
but it is only in the past ten to 15 years , with the rise of drug - resistant superbugs , that copper 's antimicrobial properties have attracted renewed attention			1
there have since been dozens of studies highlighting the extraordinary power of copper to destroy potentially lethal organisms such as @entity15 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
when these bacteria come into contact with copper surfaces , they rapidly self - destruct			1
it is thought that copper effectively punches holes in the outer membrane of bacteria , viruses and fungi in such a way that the cells implode			0
this makes it very unlikely that superbugs will learn to become resistant to the treatment			0
' when bugs come into contact with a copper surface , they are like a boat that has sprung a leak - the copper floods in and engulfs the organism , ' says professor @entity97 , a microbiologist and director of the environmental healthcare unit at @entity100			2
professor @entity97 's experiments show that when bugs encounter a copper surface , they are killed off in under 90 minutes			0
his team placed ten million bacteria on a square centimetre of stainless steel ( used for door handles , taps and other fittings in most hospitals ) , and on pure copper			0
the results , published in the @entity115 in 2008 , showed bacteria survived on the stainless steel for several days			0
but within 90 minutes , there was no trace of them on the @entity124 year , a study by scientists at the @entity120 reported that @entity15 infection rates among intensive care patients were more than halved if copper alloy surfaces replaced steel or plastic ones			1
another study found that spraying steel fittings with a copper coating virtually eradicated bugs			0
in the @entity136 , copper 's use has been confined to a handful of hospitals taking part in bug - busting trials - yet these studies all found that copper led to a dramatic reduction in bacteria on surfaces			2
at the moment , most @entity136 trusts try to combat superbugs through strict hygiene , mainly involving alcohol - based gels for hands , and chlorine products , such as bleach , for sterilising surfaces			2
but evidence suggests chlorine provides only short - lived sterility , and corrodes surfaces , allowing bugs to ' hide ' in grooves and cracks			2
meanwhile , repeated contact with alcohol - based hand gels can lead to dry and cracked skin			2
leading microbiologists confess they are baffled and frustrated by the @entity136 's failure to use copper			0
' it 's a great shame because the science is absolutely solid , ' says dr @entity169 , consultant in microbiology and infection at @entity172			2
five years ago , dr @entity169 and his colleagues helped to develop a range of gels and handwashes made from liquid copper to tackle hospital superbugs			0
the rationale was that although copper surfaces work well , they still have to be kept scrupulously clean to kill bacteria - and once a layer of residue builds up , perhaps from alcohol gels used by staff , the copper becomes less effective			2
' we took copper and enhanced its antibacterial capacity in liquid form by over a thousand times , ' says dr @entity169			0
' in trials we took four wards and cleaned them either as normal , using chlorine or detergent , or with copper solution - and found a significant reduction in all known bacteria by cleaning with liquid copper			1
' dr @entity169 then joined forces with a company called @entity204 to develop microfibre cleaning cloths pre-loaded with copper solution			2
six weeks later @entity15 had completely healed			1
@entity0 insists that the solution was a pair of pyjamas made from fabric with fine strands of copper but the @entity136 trusts they approached preferred to stick with conventional cleaning methods			1
' so we gave up , ' says dr @entity169			0
' i am not a businessman			0
' when it comes to copper surfaces , hospitals often cite expense as a reason not to replace existing fittings , says dr @entity225 , a microbiologist at @entity226 in @entity227			0
stainless steel currently trades for between £ 1,800 and £ 2,400 a tonne , while copper fetches nearly £ 4,500			2
but as dr @entity225 points out : ' we 've got stainless steel which does n't work and copper which does			0
it 's a no - brainer			2
' the costs of installing copper in hospital wards could be recouped within two months , due to fewer infections and patients leaving hospital sooner , according to a report in june 2013 by the @entity243 , which is part of @entity245 looked at installing copper in an intensive care unit on surfaces such as bedrails and chairs			0
but can copper fabrics have the same benefits ? ' yes , ' says professor @entity97			0
' when bacteria come into contact with copper in the clothing , it kills them			0
' tests suggest that washing the fabric at any temperature does n't weaken its effect			0
' copper fabrics are now being looked at for wound healing , ' adds professor @entity97			2
' copper stimulates several enzymes that promote healing			0
it has great potential for things such as diabetic ulcers that wo n't heal			0
' experiments show that when bugs encounter a copper surface , they are killed off in under 90 minutes @entity0 found her copper pyjamas through a friend who works for the supplier @entity278			1
within days of her @entity280 at @entity281 , it was clear her wound was infected			1
two weeks later @entity0 was discharged , on high - dose antibiotics , as it was thought she would do better at home			1
however , her gp sent her back for urgent hospital treatment			0
under general anaesthetic , she was given a ' debridement ' , where rotting flesh is removed			0
but they could n't remove all the affected tissue and , as a last resort , @entity0 was given maggot therapy			1
usually the maggots live for about five days : @entity0 's wound was so toxic , they died within a day			1
in desperation , after a month on antibiotics she turned to the copper pyjamas , which are made from 40 per cent copper - infused yarn and a fabric derived from bamboo			1
@entity0 wore the pyjamas virtually round the clock , and after two weeks she noticed that the wound was gradually shrinking			1
' i was very cynical about them at the beginning , and the infection control nurses who came to my house warned it could take a year for the wound to heal properly			1
' they were amazed at the speed of my recovery			0
after a few weeks , when there was no longer any sign of infection , they thought they must have made a mistake			1
' @entity324 is now carrying out experiments with copper clothing for staff and bedding for maternity patients			0
experts agree that copper fabrics wo n't help most healthy people			0
but it may be worth investing in them if you need surgery and fear picking up a hospital infection .			2
