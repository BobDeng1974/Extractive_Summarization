by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 ’s reshuffle was thrown into chaos last night after it was revealed his new law minister was found guilty of professional misconduct after illicitly obtaining case notes from a race - hate trial			1
@entity10 mp @entity9 , 45 , was censured by a tribunal following his intervention into an enquiry over an attack by 13 @entity15 on a white pupil at a school where he was governor			1
mr @entity9 , appointed @entity19 last week , last night admitted that he did not tell @entity3 of the charge			1
his new job includes making sure lawyers do not bring the profession into disrepute – as he was found to have done			2
new solicitor general @entity9 was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers ’ ruling body , the @entity25 he was found guilty by the disciplinary tribunal of the barristers ’ ruling body , the @entity25 , which was headed by fellow @entity10 mps @entity29 , the then justice secretary , and @entity32 , the attorney general until last week			1
mr @entity9 yesterday faced calls to resign from his new post			1
the @entity35 has learned that in 2011 mr @entity9 , a former barrister and part - time judge who has been mp for @entity37 since 2010 , was hauled before a disciplinary tribunal of the barristers ’ ruling body , after he broke the lawyers ’ code of conduct by demanding court documents from a barrister			1
the censure of mr @entity46 of the @entity47 the incident occurred in 2008 when mr @entity9 was a governor at @entity49 in @entity50 , near @entity37 , and had been asked to investigate an attack by an @entity53 gang – four of whom were pupils – on a white boy at the school			1
@entity58 , then 15 , was punched , kicked and hit with a claw hammer and his mother @entity60 accused the school of being responsible			1
thirteen men were later convicted of the attack			2
following this , mr @entity9 , then a prospective mp , told mrs @entity60 he was conducting an internal investigation			1
he also revealed he had asked a fellow barrister , @entity67 , who had defended one of the gang , @entity70 , for case notes			2
mrs @entity60 , however , was horrified at the breach			1
she said : ‘ he was a school governor but if the school had been found guilty of racism that would have affected his career			1
‘ i think he should resign			0
i ’m amazed he took up the appointment			0
i do n’t see how someone who appears to have so little understanding of the law can take a job which demands this level of moral fibre , this level of responsibility			0
it ’s also outrageous that he did n’t mention that he had this in his past when he took the job			0
he must have hoped it would all be swept under the carpet			0
’ believing mr @entity9 was trying to ‘ appease ’ her , and furious he was breaching protocol , mrs @entity60 told the police at the time			1
mrs @entity60 said : ‘ i had a meeting with @entity95 who ordered a serious case review of the school , and i also told @entity99 , the shadow secretary of education			1
finally i went to the @entity100			0
’ documents obtained by @entity35 reveal mr @entity9 was called to a disciplinary hearing on march 31 , 2011 to hear and determine the charge of professional misconduct at @entity105 of the @entity47			1
they state the defendants were found guilty of professional misconduct			1
under @entity109 they say : ‘ @entity9 and @entity67 engaged in conduct likely to diminish confidence in the legal profession or the administration of justice or otherwise bring the legal profession into disrepute			1
’ they state the offence as : ‘ mr @entity9 requested mr @entity67 to give him access to , and mr @entity67 agreed to provide access to , the case papers in the criminal trial of @entity128 [ sic ] and others , the said papers being passed to mr @entity9 when mr @entity9 had no entitlement to be provided with those papers and both parties being aware he was not so entitled at the time			1
’ @entity70 , 19 , was jailed for a year for his part in the vicious attack on @entity58 that left @entity58 with brain injuries mr @entity9 ’s school investigation never concluded because mrs @entity60 launched a civil action against the school for failing to protect her son			1
last night mr @entity9 , a married father of twins , confessed to @entity35 that he had failed to notify the @entity138 of the misdemeanour			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a matter of public record			0
it ’s been recorded by the @entity143			0
it happened three years ago			0
‘ it was a genuine attempt by me to establish facts at the school			0
this is the only time i have had any issue with the @entity143			0
i genuinely thought i was taking the right action for the school			0
i regret it ended up in the position it did			0
’ mr @entity9 tried to say the matter was ‘ spent ’ because more than two years had passed but last night the @entity143 said disciplinary findings stay on a barrister ’s disciplinary record indefinitely			1
mr @entity67 did not return calls made by @entity35			2
last night , a spokesman for the solicitor general ’s office said : ‘ this finding was removed from the @entity100 records after two years and therefore mr @entity9 was not required to declare it upon appointment as solicitor general			1
” but @entity169 ’s shadow attorney general , @entity168 , accused mr @entity9 of ‘ bad judgement ’ for failing to declare the offence			1
she said : ‘ it is very important that the post of @entity19 is one the @entity174 and the public can have complete trust in			0
’ @entity169 last night said ‘ we will be raising more questions about this matter ’			2
solicitor general and a crime that stunned us all the solicitor general ’s ‘ professional misconduct ’ centred on a case where ‘ reverse racism ’ meant teachers allegedly turned a blind eye to @entity53 gangs targeting white children at school			2
the policy was designed to protect an influx of 20 @entity53 students whom teachers feared might be bullied when they arrived in 2005			0
in fact , as was later found by a serious case review , the reverse had taken place at the 1,450 - pupil @entity49 in suburban @entity37			1
@entity60 , whose son @entity58 was almost killed in an attack in january 2007 , said : ‘ everyone knew what was going on at that school , that there was a culture of racism by the @entity53 students			1
‘ there had been a number of incidents			0
one boy had his nose broken by the same gang that attacked @entity58			2
‘ police knew about all it			0
but teachers would n’t deal with this reverse racism			0
they had this perception that the @entity53 kids were being racially abused when it was the other way around			0
‘ they created an @entity53 safe zone at the school and kept claiming the @entity53 kids were being victimised			0
there was a fear at the school of being perceived as having a racial problem			0
they simply did n’t know what to do about it			0
’ @entity58 was 15 when , in january 2007 , he was set upon by a group of @entity53 youths who called themselves ‘ @entity230 ’			1
@entity58 had agreed to fight a boy ‘ one on one ’ to end the harassment he felt he and his friends were experiencing			2
victim : @entity58 with his mother @entity236			2
mr @entity58 was left with brain damage after the attack with a hammer by a gang of @entity15 @entity58 – a 6ft 2ins rugby player who stood out because of his flaming red hair and strong stature – was punched , kicked and hit six times with a claw hammer in a vicious attack by the group that lasted about a minute			1
he suffered three skull fractures – the hammer went into the fluid around his brain – and he had surgery to save his life			2
seven young men were convicted of wounding @entity58 with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm			2
@entity256 were convicted of conspiracy			0
they were given custodial sentences ranging from eight months to eight years			0
others received suspended sentences of up to 18 months			0
only four were pupils at the school			0
the court was told the conflicts at the school resembled something one might see in a @entity271 movie			2
@entity58 and his family accused the school of failing to discipline @entity53 pupils who abused or intimidated white classmates			1
in 2009 his family launched a @entity278 challenge claiming the school had been negligent , failed to maintain proper discipline or deal with racial tension			0
in february 2010 , mr @entity284 rejected the family ’s claims and said the school did not breach its duty to take reasonable care to keep @entity58 reasonably safe while on the premises			1
following that ruling the @entity291 commissioned a serious case review			0
published in 2010 , it found the school had failed to tackle escalating racial tensions between @entity53 and white teenagers – even after a riot on the playing fields			2
it found that not only should playground bullying be monitored for racism , but that schools should appoint ‘ different race ’ mentors for new pupils to help them settle in			2
and teachers should consult parents about whether their approaches to religious and cultural requirements are ‘ continuously appropriate			0
’ mrs @entity60 , 50 , who runs a recruitment agency for domestic staff and nannies maintains that the school was responsible for @entity58 ’s attack			1
‘ we were never able to see the full serious case review , ’ she said			0
‘ there was something in there the authorities did n’t want me to see			0
‘ had the integration of the @entity53 students been properly handled we are certain this attack would never have happened			2
’ @entity58 , 23 , is now at university but mrs @entity60 says he still suffers ‘ fatigue problems ’ .			1

@entity10 mp @entity9 , 45 , censured by tribunal following his intervention into an enquiry over an attack by 13 @entity15 on a white pupil
@entity58 , then 15 , was punched , kicked and hit with a claw hammer
all 13 @entity15 - four of them *schoolboys* - later found guilty of the attack
