at the time of my career , for this @entity3 trophy to arrive is crucial , especially after losing three finals in a row			1
i had started doubting myself a little			2
’ the @entity15 admitted he was relieved to win his first @entity3 since appointing @entity16 as his coach last december			1
‘ i was close to winning on several occasions , particularly in the fourth set when i served for the match , and i could easily have lost concentration in the fifth and handed him the win			1
‘ but i did n’t , and that ’s why this win has special importance to me mentally			1
i managed to not just win against my opponent but win against myself as well and find that inner strength that got me the trophy			2
‘ i think that this year everything got together and emotionally , physically and mentally i was on the top of my abilities			2
‘ i ’m going to try to use it in the best possible way and for my confidence to grow for the rest of my season and my career			2
’ @entity50 wins second @entity5 title thumbs up : @entity0 will overtake @entity52 as @entity53 1 in the new rankings @entity55 : the @entity15 won 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 on @entity56 against @entity21 @entity0 , who will marry his pregnant fiancee @entity57 in a small ceremony in @entity59 on wednesday , took a bite out of the grass after beating @entity21 in five sets — just as he did after defeating @entity52 to win his first @entity5 title in 2011 — but said the turf tasted even better this time around			1
‘ i had a nice bite of the grass , ’ he said			2
‘ i thought there was less grass than a few years ago , so i had a little bit of soil as well			2
but , nevertheless , it tastes like the best meal i ever had in my life			0
‘ but , sincerely , this has been the best quality @entity3 final that i ever been part of			0
i ’ve had a longest final against @entity52 in the @entity77 but , quality-wise from the first to last point , this is definitely the best match			0
to be able to win against @entity21 , one of my greatest rivals , on this occasion on a court that he ’s been dominating for so many years makes it a very special trophy for me			1
i had tears of joy and was overwhelmed by the moment and the occasion			0
’ stretch : the 27 - year - old @entity0 took his total of major titles to seven with his second at @entity5 @entity0 insisted he was not distracted by the @entity56 crowd ’s vociferous support for @entity21 , the seven - time champion who was consoled by the the @entity94 and @entity95 after his defeat			1
@entity21 , though , joked that he does ‘ not need another ’ @entity5 crown , but said there is still more to come from him , even at the age of 32			1
the @entity100 said : ‘ i already have seven			0
it ’s not like i need another one			0
but it would have been awfully nice to have it			2
i think that ’s what the feeling was of the people , and i felt that			0
beaten : @entity21 joked that he did n't need another @entity5 title after his defeat on @entity56 popular : @entity21 is a seven - time champion at @entity111 and says an eighth would have been ' awfully nice ' ‘ in a match like the one today where i needed support , they were there			1
i could sense that they really wished me well and hoped for me to either get back into the match or hopefully lift another trophy here at @entity5			1
‘ i ’m very happy to see that , with feeling normal , i can produce a performance like i did in the last two weeks			0
that clearly makes me believe that this was just a stepping stone to many more great things in the future			0
‘ i feel like if i ’m playing well i feel like i can control the field to a degree			0
clearly there ’s never a guarantee , but i do believe the top guys are the ones we know and who are still going to be deciding outcomes of the bigger tournaments			0
i ’m very happy to see that i can do it week for week , match for match and point for point			0
it ’s all right there			0
