by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 6 february 2013 having your bins emptied outside your home does n’t seem much to expect when paying more than £ 1,500 a year in council tax			1
but for the villagers of @entity7 in @entity8 , life is n’t quite that easy			2
their local council wanted the villagers to drag their 240 - litre wheelie bins more than a mile and a half up a steep hill for them to be emptied			1
waste of time : residents of @entity18 and @entity19 , such as @entity20 , would have to walk almost two miles with their wheelie bins to leave them for collection before the council 's u-turn the council stopped picking up the bins as a cost - cutting measure , but residents were furious about it @entity29 , pictured , would have to make the a four mile round trip with her wheelie bin if the council refused to collect rubbish when the residents protested , the council ’s ‘ compromise ’ was that they could leave the bin behind and lug the refuse sacks up the hill instead			1
however , @entity40 has now backed down			1
farmer @entity41 , of @entity18 , said : ' it 's great that they 're going to do that			2
but i do n't know why they wanted to make the changes in the first place			2
they did n't consult us properly			2
' the @entity51 has decided to remove the litter bins from residential streets , controversially claiming that they attract more rubbish			2
officials at the council said that bins on the street encourage fly - tipping , increasing the amount of litter left behind			1
local , @entity63 , 27 , a pr manager from @entity64 , said : ‘ i do n’t think they have asked the local residents			2
they are always full , people use them			2
they should be adding more , not taking them away			2
’ despite objections , the council claims that when bins are removed from streets , there is only a slight increase in littering			0
@entity75 , head of waste at the council , said in a report : ‘ there are two schools of thought regarding litter bins ; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use , indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste , otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street			0
‘ the other is that litter bins attract more rubbish , some of which can be unpaid - for commercial waste and domestic waste			1
’ as well as the logistical problems of transporting the bins to the collection point , residents had raised concerns that the large volume of bins , heavy traffic flow and narrow roads would have led to an increase in accidents			1
councillor @entity109 , portfolio holder for the environment and sustainability , said the council had now organised a ‘ mutually acceptable ' alternative with the residents			0
he said : ' we are facing unprecedented funding cuts , and as a result have reviewed all of the services we provide , including waste collection			0
as a result , like other rural councils , we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from lanes			0
' however in this instance , we 've listened and have already arranged a mutually acceptable and practical alternative with residents , as we would look to do wherever concerns are raised			0
' @entity131 , @entity40 's head of neighbourhoods , previously told the @entity133 the council was ‘ no longer able to afford to travel significant distances down lanes to collect people 's waste '			1
a @entity40 spokeswoman confirmed that there was no way to practically implement the policy in the @entity7 situation so , at the moment , the council would be continuing to collect the waste as normal			1
the bags would then be collected from a large bin stationed at the end of the lane			0
the rules , were due to come into effect on february 15 , were part of a cost - cutting drive by @entity40 – which had said it was no longer prepared to collect rubbish from ‘ off - route properties ’			1
before the council 's u-turn mr @entity20 , 56 , said it was absolute ‘ madness ’ to expect elderly residents to embark on a three - mile round trip			1
‘ there are at least five residents who are in their eighties and they simply wo n’t be able to do it , ’ he said			0
‘ it is an absolutely ludicrous situation and we ’re frankly disgusted that the council would allow this to happen considering how much we all pay for our council tax			0
’ @entity7 residents @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity41 , above , spoke out against the council 's decision to cut the bin service from 14 houses mr @entity20 , who lives with his wife @entity178 in @entity7 , added : ‘ it does n’t make environmental sense to have 14 homes running 14 vehicles up the road to drop their bins off			0
there is no room for bins where they are proposing to have it collected			0
you ’ve got loads of cars and school buses going down that road			0
‘ there have already been accidents – this will make it worse			1
’ until now the residents , whose annual council tax bill is £ 1,569 , put their rubbish in individual wheelie bins and a wagon has driven up @entity204 in @entity7 once a fortnight to collect it			1
the authority hoped the scheme would save £ 120,000			1
it will still make assisted collections for disabled residents but has said this will be carried out with smaller vehicles			0
councillor @entity109 , a spokesman for the environment and sustainability , said : ‘ we are facing unprecedented funding cuts and have reviewed all of the services we provide , including waste collection			0
‘ as a result , like other rural councils we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from lanes			0

measures were part of cost - cutting drive by @entity40
@entity231 hoped scheme will save £ 120,000 but *homeowners* were enraged
they described it as ' madness ' and said changes would cause accidents
