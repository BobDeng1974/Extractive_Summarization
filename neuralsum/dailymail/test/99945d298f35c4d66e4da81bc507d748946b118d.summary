on saturday , @entity0 swooped to within just 8.6 miles of comet @entity2 's surface			1
during this close flyby , the probe was able to capture a stunning four image montage showing the two lobes of the icy comet in incredible detail			0
the top right frame offers a stunning view onto @entity11 , the comet ’s ‘ neck ’ region that is littered with boulders			1
as part of the recent moves around comet @entity17 , @entity0 swooped to within about 8.6 miles ( 14 km ) of the comet ’s surface on saturday			1
its camera was able to capture a four image montage scale at this distance is 1.7 m / pixel showing the large lobe of the icy comet to the left and the small lobe to the right the view also gives a detailed look at the numerous , curved markings visible on the smooth surface			1
in the same frame , details in the cliffs of @entity36 can be seen , leading up to the ‘ head ’ of the comet ’s small lobe			1
the region towards the right of this frame shows the transition between this smooth , presumably dust - covered portion , and the layered , exposed cliffs below			0
the @entity47 also recently released a trove ofimages captured by the @entity0 probe during its long journey to @entity2 / @entity51			1
this stunning scene was created from two @entity0 frames acquired at 12 miles ( 19.9 km ) from the comet centre on 28 march			1
the scale is about 1.7 m / pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km the top right frame offers a stunning view onto @entity11 , the comet ’s ‘ neck ’ region littered with boulders			1
the scale at this distance is 1.4 m / pixel they include images of @entity69 and @entity70 which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘ gravity assist manoeuvres ’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet			2
as @entity0 makes an adventurous passes through the geysers of comet in the coming months , scientists hope to discover more information about the comet ’s interior from the jets			1
the @entity0 probe , which was carrying @entity85 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity69 and @entity70 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity17			1
it chased comet @entity51 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity85 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet			1
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			2
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			1
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
@entity85 managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , is continuing to orbit and study the comet			2
from data collected by the two proves , @entity47 said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity69 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			2
and with the comet becoming more active as it approaches the sun , these next few months are providing the best opportunity yet to study the comet - but it is not without risk			2
‘ the comet is getting super exciting , ’ said @entity47 ’s @entity134 scientist dr @entity133 in @entity135			1
‘ hundreds of kilos per second of material is flinging off it			0
we want to a do a fly - by through one of these active regions			0
’ the probe will be brought within nine miles ( 15km ) of the comet , with its path taking it right through @entity2 ’s geysers			1
these jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. it is getting closer and closer over the next few months , with its point of closest approach taking place in august			2
as it becomes more active , @entity0 has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data			2
in so doing , though , the probe can become disorientated			0
it relies on seeing stars to know where it is , but the jets can obscure its view			0
this means that , occasionally , the spacecraft has to take evasive actions when it passes through a jet , to get itself into empty space and re-orientate itself relative to the stars			0
but studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface , and it could also reveal the connection between the comet ’s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface			1
as the comet gets closer to the sun , scientists will also be hoping to hear from the @entity85 lander on the surface			0
the washing machine - sized @entity85 probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet @entity17 on 12 november 2014			0
but after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface , the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power			0
the @entity47 also recently released a trove of images captured by the @entity0 probe during its long journey to @entity2 / @entity51			1
seen here is @entity0 's view of @entity69 on march 5th , 2005 the latest images include ones of @entity69 and @entity70 which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘ gravity assist manoeuvres ’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet			1
pictured is @entity70 as seen by @entity0 in 2007 now , as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge @entity85 ’s batteries and bring it back to life			1
earlier in march scientists sent commands to the lander in the hope it would respond , but with no luck			0
on 14 april they will make another attempt to get in contact - and , if it stirs from its slumber , @entity85 will have a fantastic opportunity to study the comet as it reaches peak activity			2
speaking about the most recent attempt to find the probe , @entity0 mission manager @entity229 told @entity232 : ‘ we were trying to see if the lander would wake up and , at the same time , we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation			0
‘ we do n’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander			0
’ the main issue at the moment is that , for the lander simply to wake up , it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45 ° @entity249 )			0
but to start communicating with @entity0 again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power			0
it may have already reached the former level , which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we wo n’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter			0
the next few months are certain to be an exciting time , though - not just for @entity85 , but for the orbiting @entity0 spacecraft as well .			2

on saturday , @entity0 was just 8.6 miles ( 14 km ) of the comet ’s surface
images reveal one of most detailed photos of the comet 's bump ' neck '
@entity47 recently released a trove of images captured from @entity0 's journey
@entity0 will make passes through comet geysers in the coming months
