by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 06:30 est , 14 march 2013 the @entity2 ’s latest exhibition showcases every aspect of life in ancient @entity5			0
perhaps , says its curator , in rather too much risqué detail for some visitors			2
a sculpture showing the @entity11 god @entity10 in an erotic clinch with a female goat is accompanied by a discreet ‘ parental guidance ’ notice that it is ‘ sexually explicit ’			1
@entity16 : the statue of @entity10 and @entity18 will go on display at the @entity2 as part of its new exhibition of artefacts from the ruined cities of @entity24 and @entity25 the statue of @entity10 , himself half goat , would have been a cultured joke to the wealthy @entity28 who placed it in their garden			1
recently , more prudish tastes have prevailed and the sculpture is normally housed in an ‘ over- 14s ’ area at the @entity34			1
but it will be proudly displayed at a new show , @entity37 in @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity38 , senior curator , said : ‘ we have a small notice advising parents that there ’s adult content , but certainly not a curtain , which it has had elsewhere			2
‘ to a @entity47 it would have been humorous			2
i doubt there would have been a household without something sexual			0
’ also on show is a bronze phallus wind chime			0
a small notice on the wall of the gallery reads : ‘ this section of the exhibition contains sexually explicit material			0
’ @entity2 : the museum said the erotic sculpture would have been amusing , rather than offensive , to @entity28 erotic art was commonplace in the ill - fated cities of @entity24 and @entity25 , which were buried within the space of a single day in ad 79 by a catastrophic volcanic eruption from @entity67			1
phalluses and representations of the @entity11 fertility god @entity70 adorned paintings and mosaics , and were even carved into doorways and paving stones			0
the @entity2 's exhibition also features an array of other , non-erotic artefacts , including wall paintings , wooden furniture and a garden bench from 1,700 years that were part of the daily lives of the cities ' residents 1,700 years ago			1
the exhibition will open on march 28 .			0
