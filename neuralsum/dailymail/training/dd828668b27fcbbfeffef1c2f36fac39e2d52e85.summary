by @entity0 @entity3 's upcoming book @entity4 contains a detailed chapter on the september 11 , 2012 terrorist attack in @entity7 , @entity1 has learned			1
in the 34 - page chapter of the book , which @entity1 obtained ahead of the book 's june 10 release date , the former secretary of state writes that the death of four @entity14 , including @entity14 ambassador to @entity17 @entity16 , was ' a punch in the gut ' and ' a crushing blow ' but maintains that she did nothing wrong			1
@entity22 are doing a disservice to the @entity14 who died in the attack by continuing to assassinate her character , @entity27 suggests			1
' those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country , ' she writes			1
' i will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead @entity14			2
it ’s just plain wrong , and it ’s unworthy of our great country			2
those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me			2
in it , she defends the @entity53 administration 's response to the terrorist attack in @entity7 on september 11 , 2012 in the chapter @entity27 rehashes the @entity57 and @entity58 's response to the turmoil in @entity7 both before and after the terrorist attack			1
in one passage @entity27 makes the case that the much talked about @entity65 video was ' indeed a factor ' in the attack on the @entity7 consulate			1
' there were scores of attackers that night , almost certainly with differing motives , ' she writes			0
' it is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by this hateful video			0
it is equally inaccurate to state that none of them were			0
both assertions defy not only the evidence but logic as well			0
' @entity27 maintains that what @entity14 ambassador to the @entity87 @entity86 told @entity14 about the video on news shows was the best information available at the time			1
@entity93 simply espoused the talking points created by the @entity95 for members of @entity97 , @entity27 says , repeating prior claims			2
' @entity86 stated what the intelligence community believed , rightly or wrongly , at the time , ' @entity27 says			2
' that was the best she or anyone could do			0
every step of the way , whenever something new was learned , it was quickly shared with @entity97 and the @entity14 people			0
' ' there is a difference between getting something wrong , and committing wrong			0
a big difference that some have blurred to the point of casting those who made a mistake as intentionally deceitful , ' she continues			0
the former secretary of state also sheds light on how @entity93 ended up on the sunday morning news shows in the first place			0
to political observers , it seemed odd at the time that the @entity14 ambassador to the @entity87 was designated by the @entity57 to go on the shows instead of a senior or cabinet level official			1
@entity27 says in the book she did n't do it because it was n't her job to represent the administration on talk shows			2
there are those who ' fixate on the question of why i did n’t go on tv that morning , as if appearing on a talk show is the equivalent of jury duty , where one has to have a compelling reason to get out of it			0
' @entity27 writes , ' i do n’t see appearing on sunday - morning television as any more of a responsibility than appearing on late - night tv			1
' ' only in @entity146 is the definition of talking to @entity14 confined to 9 a.m. on sunday mornings			0
' @entity27 , a more stern and serious politician than she was during her husband 's presidency , is positioning herself for a @entity57 run of her own kn 2016 it also was n't her job to read the cables being transmitted to @entity58 from personnel on the ground warning of growing security threats even though they are addressed to her , @entity27 notes			1
' that ’s not how it works			0
' @entity27 reiterates in the book that her name was only on the diplomatic cables because of a ' procedural quirk , ' and that 's why she never saw the cables from @entity16 leading up to the attack in which he relayed the commander of @entity7 's @entity176 's concerns that police and security forces were not equipped to handle unrest in the area			1
@entity22 groups have made quick work of tearing down @entity27 's claims			2
' @entity27 ’s claim not only that she was n’t aware of security requests , but actually should n’t have been bothered with them , is nothing short of appalling , ' @entity184 , a @entity22 opposition research outfit , wrote in a blog post on its website this morning			2
' @entity27 also seems to be one of the last people who still believe that the attack was fueled by an anti-islam video			2
' in a research briefing ' @entity198 @entity3 's @entity197 , ' the @entity199 points to testimony from former deputy chief of mission @entity201 , who was one of the highest - ranking officials in @entity17 at the time , that the attack was not the result of a spontaneous protest to to the distasteful @entity208 video			1
a year ago @entity201 told officials from the @entity210 , ' i think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning			0
' trouble in paradise : @entity27 's june 2 speech at a huge concert arena in @entity219 has been a hard sell for political supporters , causing @entity222 to offer tickets for 1/3 the original pice the rest of @entity27 's memoir will be released next month , but no other chapter is likely to draw as much attention as the one that was leaked today			1
the @entity7 section was reportedly being circulated among influential democrats so they could familiarize themselves with @entity27 's claims before next month 's release			1
@entity1 's sources also say that former @entity238 spokesman @entity237 is helping @entity27 with the roll out			1
@entity237 , who no longer works for the @entity53 administration in any capacity , notably told @entity242 earlier this month that he does n't ' really remember ' what changes he did or did not make to @entity93 's talking points in his capacity as @entity238 spokesman			0
' dude , this was like two years ago , ' he said			0
@entity1 tried to get @entity27 's spokesman , @entity248 , to provide further insight into @entity27 's defense strategy , but he declined to comment on her thinking			1
' until the book is released , there ’s nothing to say			0
and once it ’s released , it will speak for itself , ' he said .			0

' those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country , ' she writes in a new memoir
@entity27 faces tough *criticism* for her actions before , during and after the 2012 terror attack in @entity17
she *desperately* needs to parry @entity7 - related attacks if she hopes to make a *credible* @entity57 run in 2016
@entity1 , a news outlet generally *favorable* to the @entity278 , was given an advance peek at a 34 - page chapter of the *autobiographical* ' @entity4 '
