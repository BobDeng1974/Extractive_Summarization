trials : researchers at @entity2 in @entity3 found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue expectant mums really do bloom - for being pregnant has a ' rejuvenating effect ' on women , according to new scientific research			1
and for older women it could help them feel young again , almost literally , as pregnancy helps regenerate tissue and slow down the ageing process , it added			1
appearing to bloom is not just a cosmetic side effect of carrying a child , said medical experts for the journal @entity19 but an actual physical process			0
researchers studied the effects of liver transplants on pregnant and non-pregnant mice using a high - tech mri scanner at the @entity2 in @entity3			1
it found in young , non-pregnant mice , 82 per cent of the liver had regenerated after two days and in older , non-pregnant mice , only 46 per cent had regenerated in that time			0
but in older , pregnant mice around 96 per cent had regenerated after two days , better than the non-pregnant rodents both young and old , they reported			0
they also found that pregnancy protected the rodents from tissue damage around the heart , which is also an irreversible part of the human ageing process , said the study			2
pregnancy is a unique condition for the human body , said the researchers , and as a result it has to cope with two people 's systems at the same time			2
for the older of the two bodies , it is as if it has been injected with a youth serum from the baby it is carrying , hence the rejuvenating process affecting the mother , it suggests			1
the report added : ' as we age , it is more difficult for our tissue to regenerate itself			0
' because pregnancy is a unique biological model of a partially shared blood system , we have speculated that pregnancy would have a rejuvenating effect on the mother			0
' @entity66 , @entity67 in @entity68 at @entity69 , who led the review , has also done research that suggests that pregnancy can restore the mother 's muscles ' ability to regenerate			1
the research found , in the mice used to test their hypothesis , that the positive effect of pregnancy was ' transient ' and lasted for about two months after delivery			2
serum : say tests carried out on pregnant mice suggested they ' got youth serum injection ' from babies previous research has also found that old mice given a transfusion of younger mice 's blood performed better in a memory task than those that aged naturally			1
a study by @entity93 found that changes in the make - up of people 's blood as they age may damage connections in the brain and so cause memory deterioration and the decline of other brain functions			0
this could be tackled by filtering more youthful blood into the older body , which would rejuvenate old tissue and keep nerve cells in better working order , according to the research .			0

researchers in @entity3 found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue
suggest pregnancy could restore mother 's muscles ' ability to regenerate
claim mice ' got youth serum injection ' from babies they were carrying
