by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 failed to get his first win as @entity5 manager after being held to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity7			1
@entity5 's @entity9 playmaker @entity8 opened the scoring before the @entity7 ' £ 10 million summer signing @entity11 equalised in the second - half			1
the midfielder , who joined @entity7 from champions @entity25 over the summer , slipped before crashing down on his backside in front of the ecstatic home fans			0
his joyous team - mates quickly hauled him back to his feet and , thankfully , @entity11 was ok			0
here 's one i made earlier : referee @entity32 ( r ) was able to recycle his vanishing spray we had our first instance of vanishing spray being recycled			1
@entity5 had only just defended a free - kick from the right channel when @entity39 seized upon the clearance only to be chopped down again by @entity41 in exactly the same spot			0
referee @entity32 merely had to ‘ touch up ’ his earlier effort			2
we 've heard of the @entity7 , but what about the white dogs ? a pair of huskies — complete with @entity7 shirts and red and white ribbons — were spotted outside the ground before the game			0
it ’s just a shame @entity7 lacked the attacking bite to see off @entity5 , whose forward line was similarly toothless			2
@entity5 had 10 shots on goal , but could not add to @entity8 ’s 17th - minute opener			2
in - house publications are often criticised for their blinkered view of proceedings			0
however you can not level that accusation at @entity5 ’s official @entity65 feed			1
losing his bottle : @entity8 kicks out in frustration after @entity5 fail to take a late opportunity honesty is the best policy ? @entity5 's @entity65 feed gave a frank assessment of the game for with 85 minutes on the clock they posted : ‘ time is running out at the @entity15 and , in truth , @entity7 look the more likely winners at the moment ’			1
a stern - faced @entity23 , watching from the dugout , would likely have shared that assessment			0
@entity7 may have edged the contest but their wait for a win over @entity5 at the @entity15 in the @entity86 will enter its 19th year next season			1
for while they broke an @entity89 duck dating back to 1968 last season , they ’re yet to beat @entity5 at home in the @entity93 era			0
home disadvantage ? @entity7 have not beaten @entity5 at the @entity15 in 19 years the hosts had 11 shots on @entity5 ’s goal and earned a glut of free - kicks in attacking areas but could n’t find the goal to give them their first home league win over @entity5 since march 1997			1
