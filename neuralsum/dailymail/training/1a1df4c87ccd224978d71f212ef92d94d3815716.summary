by @entity0 a teenage girl was diagnosed with leukaemia when doctors revealed the crippling stomach pains she had blamed on a dodgy @entity5 was in fact blood cancer			1
@entity8 suspected she was suffering a food intolerance or an allergy when experiencing excruciating pain after a takeaway			1
when her parents rushed the 18 - year - old to hospital in august last year , doctors revealed her symptoms were a sign of something more ominous - a rare form of cancer , lymphoblastic leukaemia			1
she was immediately put on to a pioneering drugs trial funded by the charity @entity23 , which included rounds of chemotherapy and more than three months in hospital			1
but after being rushed to hospital by her parents , the 18 - year - old was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer - lymphoblastic leukaemia and today 18 - year - old , from @entity38 , has been told by doctors treating her , that her cancer is in remission			1
in august last year @entity8 was a healthy teenager , visiting the gym five times a week and enjoying her second year of sixth form			1
it was only when she had spicy food , first a @entity5 , then an @entity48 meal , and later a homemade chile con carne , that she suffered severe stomach pains and her parents rushed her to hospital			1
after another visit to hospital at the end of september doctors searching for an explanation ran tests and finally diagnosed her with leukaemia			1
she then faced six months of intensive chemotherapy and will continue to have low doses of the treatment for two years			0
@entity8 said : ' it ’s crazy that it ’s the takeaways that that led to my diagnosis			1
' i only got sick when i ate spicy food and a @entity5 takeaway put me in @entity69			1
' it ’s lucky really because it ’s not my kind of thing - i rarely eat spicy food and it was just special occasions : a meal with my friend and my dad ’s birthday			2
' it was just because everyone else was eating one - i prefer pizza really			2
' the pain was horrific but it went away after some strong painkillers			2
doctors immediately put @entity8 , pictured top right with her family , on a pioneering drugs trial which involved rounds of chemotherapy and has now been told she is in remission @entity91 is a blood cancer			1
the disease affects the white blood cells , which are an important part of our immune system , helping the body fight infection			0
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is one of the four main types of leukaemia			1
anyone can develop leukaemia at any @entity105 it is more common in adults , leukaemia is the most common form of childhood cancer , with most children diagnosed under the age of five			1
symptoms include : source : @entity23 ' because my back was aching as well they thought it might be sciatica , or that it was something like irritable bowel syndrome which is why i started keeping a food diary			0
' i do feel much better now but there are still things that restrict me - most mornings i wake up feeling sick			0
' and although i feel unlucky that i ’ve had it , i do n’t wish i had n’t had it			0
it ’s made me the person that i am and as family we ’ve all helped each other to cope			0
' having just been declared in remission , @entity8 is now desperate to raise awareness of the disease and the charity that funded the trial that saved her life			2
@entity8 ’s father @entity134 , 49 , said : ' if it had n’t been for the trips to hospital after the takeaways and the @entity23 drugs trial we do n’t know if @entity8 would be here now			1
' she was perfectly healthy and there were no other signs that anything was wrong			0
' she was n’t even a regular takeaway fan			0
the doctors told her to keep a food diary and we all thought it was food - related			2
' but then when we came in for the last time they said she had been in too many times and they needed to do some tests			0
' the next day i got a call while i was at work with @entity8 in tears and my wife @entity156 trying to explain			2
' it was absolutely devastating			0
you just feel like someone has just driven over you			0
' as a parent it ’s heart - breaking to know that your daughter is in pain but she has been so brave			2
' she would get to the middle of the night after eating some foods and be in agony , rolling around in bed			0
' now we just want to help other people with the same disease			0
' we were like rabbits in the headlights when she was first diagnosed and @entity23 ’s nurses helped us through everything			0
' if people donate money to @entity23 they can continue with the trial and help more people with the same type of cancer			2
' they have changed our lives and given us everything			0
