a structure in the heart of @entity3 ’s @entity2 – lost for a thousand years and marked on maps as ‘ @entity5 of @entity6 ’ – has been revealed as still standing and part of the @entity8			1
@entity10 researcher @entity9 , aided by @entity11 , @entity12 and several other experts , found the new section last @entity15 in @entity16 , a sensitive region 25 miles north of the @entity18 - @entity3 border			1
the @entity8 is in fact many different structures built over hundreds of years along different routes by various dynasties - this find is the first time a section has been discovered outside @entity18			1
remarkable : this part of the newly discovered @entity27 was constructed from earth and branches and built in 115 b.c high life : here the @entity27 is routed up and over an ancient volcanic cone and is composed of black blocks of basalt ‘ we followed the @entity27 there for about 100 kilometres ( 60 miles ) , parallel to @entity3 ’s southern border with @entity18 and made some unexpected discoveries in terms of both the @entity27 ’s condition and its probable age , ’ said @entity9 , who was joined on the expedition by @entity18 - @entity3 border region expert @entity35 and @entity3 geographer and desert specialist professor @entity37			1
‘ in one location we found the @entity27 preserved to a height of around 2.5 metres ( eight feet ) and made up of earth and branches of a desert shrub called saksaul			0
’ in another location about 15 miles away the team discovered that the same @entity27 detoured off its flat and straight course and went up and over an ancient volcanic cone			0
no one knows for certain how long the @entity27 actually is , because it ’s not one structure , but many , built by different dynasties , which follow different routes			1
however , @entity9 believes there ’s well over 30,000miles of @entity27 altogether			2
some parts of the @entity8 stand 26 - feet high			2
in places the @entity27 strides across mountains 3,200 - feet above sea level			0
the @entity64 ( 14th to 17th century ) is responsible for building much of what exists today , which measures over 4,000 miles			0
‘ going over the mountain it was constructed from black blocks of basalt and stands around 1.5 metres ( five feet ) high as a prominent landscape feature , ’ said @entity9 , who is one of the world ’s leading authorities on the @entity27 , having spent 25 years studying it			2
he believes that of all the examples of the @entity27 of @entity6 in @entity3 , these are in the best condition			0
he said : ‘ previously , researchers have seen parts of the so - called @entity8 of @entity6 in different regions of @entity3 where it was found only to exist as a mere mound , barely higher than its surroundings , ’ he explained			1
‘ we found a real @entity27 here , thanks to @entity11 and professor @entity37 ’s navigation of our vehicles across 150 km ( 93 miles ) of desert devoid of human activity right to our target			2
‘ we “ followed ” the @entity27 as a faint line on @entity11 across our computer screens for vast distances and were encouraged by a few stretches that showed dark shadows , which indicated the possibility of the @entity27 standing higher			0
’ despite the name assigned to this part of the @entity8 , @entity9 does n’t believe that @entity6 was actually responsible for building it			1
wild life : gazelle tracks beside the @entity27 of @entity6 sketch map of @entity3 showing the various @entity104 of @entity6 he said : ‘ @entity6 was a conquerer , not a defender , and it seems his name is given as a “ brand name ” to various things in @entity3 - so we believe it ’s just an honorific name on the @entity27			0
’ its history , is not straightforward			0
he said : ‘ @entity5 of @entity6 in @entity16 appears to be a missing piece of the @entity116 which was routed through the heart of the @entity2 around 115 b.c. if we look at maps and @entity11 , it ’s pretty clear that the @entity27 on either side of the border was in fact the same structure - the @entity27 - in ancient times			2
tourist attraction : the @entity8 in the @entity125 of @entity126 the @entity127 : this is the structure that tourists visit most often today that you 'll see on postcards the @entity116 structures , which were built between @entity133 and 220 ad ‘ now it ’s a remnant of the @entity8 marooned outside @entity18			1
’ radiocarbon dating , however , revealed that some of the wall must have been rebuilt at various times			0
‘ sample testing on three pieces carried out in the @entity141 proved that the saksaul branches from the @entity27 were cut during the 12th century - a fact that suggests it was reconstructed at that time - by a later dynasty , ’ @entity145			0
full results of @entity9 's find appears in @entity18 's march issue of @entity149 .			1

discovered in @entity3 , it 's the first time a part of the wall has been found outside @entity18
@entity10 researcher @entity9 used @entity11 to find the structure
the @entity8 is in fact many different structures built by several dynasties over different routes
