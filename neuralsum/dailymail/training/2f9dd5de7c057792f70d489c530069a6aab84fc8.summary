a law which would force future governments to increase @entity3 ’s bloated aid budget was voted through last night in the face of furious opposition from backbench @entity6			2
crucially , conservative mps were ordered to vote in favour of the proposed law , which would make the government ’s controversial policy of spending a minimum 0.7 per cent of national income on international aid a legal requirement			1
it means @entity3 ’s aid budget – which is already £ 12billion a year – will continue to grow if the economy grows , unless the law is repealed			1
last night , one furious mp described it as a ‘ sop ’ to ‘ guardian - reading liberals ’			1
ministers today backed a @entity20 proposal to enshrine in law the government 's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on foreign aid			1
supplies of @entity3 aid were dropped over northern @entity33 last month to help fleeing yazidis cornered by @entity36 terrorists but government support for the @entity38 , which was proposed by a backbench @entity20 mp and is also backed by @entity39 , means it is much more likely to become law			1
significantly , it could also derail attempts by @entity6 to pass into law a @entity38 for an @entity46 referendum in 2017 by taking up limited debating time			0
a @entity20 @entity47 on the ‘ spare room subsidy ’ is already on its way to the @entity53 and after yesterday ’s vote , supporters of the @entity46 referendum @entity47 will find it much more difficult to find the time to debate it			2
a group of @entity59 backbenchers furiously opposed the aid @entity47 , warning about the dangers of waste and corruption in aid spending			1
conservative mp for @entity65 , @entity66 , described the @entity38 as ‘ gesture politics of the worst possible kind ’			1
he added : ‘ if you criticise @entity3 ’s huge , often mismanaged , aid budget you are accused of not wanting to help the neediest in the world			2
[ @entity76 ] says we are going to spend the same amount of money every single year in perpetuity			2
@entity59 mp @entity66 said the @entity38 was only going through @entity77 to ' make a few middle - class , @entity79 - reading , sandal - wearing , lentil - eating do - gooders ' feel better about themselves ‘ that is basically an acceptance that our assistance will fail , that it will not turn around a country ’s fortunes or deal with the causes of poverty , and that it will just be a hand - out to make a few middle - class , @entity79 - reading , sandal - wearing , lentil - eating do - gooders with a misguided guilt complex feel better about themselves			1
' it will do nothing to alleviate the real causes of poverty in those countries			0
’ former @entity100 secretary @entity99 introduced a private members bill today calling for the government to commit to spending a minimum amount on foreign aid he said that at a time of national austerity , huge increases in aid spending ‘ at the same time as we have been making the case that we have got no money is completely and utterly ridiculous ’			1
@entity59 backbencher sir @entity111 asked why international aid spending was being singled out when defence spending was ‘ allowed to go hang ’			1
sir @entity114 said @entity59 should be ‘ judged not by how much we spend on something but by the value for money of what we achieve ’			1
however , international development minister @entity120 backed the @entity38 , saying @entity3 ’s aid spending could help reduce the number of migrants trying to arrive here from @entity125			1
he said : ‘ there are all sorts of arguments to be had about whether it should be 0.7 per cent and a long debate might be had on that basis			0
‘ indeed , we might be having one today ... but all i can say that as an elected politician i feel myself bound by commitments that i have made and i made a commitment at the last general election to 0.7 per cent			1
’ the @entity59 minister deflected criticisms from some of his own backbenchers , fighting off the claim that ‘ charity should begin at home ’			2
mr @entity120 insisted international development aid is not charity , it is taxpayers ' money spent in the national interest on things such as vaccination programmes for children			2
he said : ‘ charity is what you dip your hand into your own pocket and distribute			0
‘ taxpayers ' money is taken from your pocket without your leave , with all the coercive power of the law behind it			0
‘ and it is essential therefore that it is spent in the national interest			0
’ back from @entity100 : former prime minister @entity165 broke off from the independence referendum campaign to back the plans in @entity168 today @entity39 ’s shadow development secretary @entity169 and former prime minister @entity165 broke off from the independence referendum campaign in @entity100 to back the plans in @entity168 today			1
mr @entity169 said : ‘ for all the dry language of spending targets , goals , statistics and shortfalls to a scale of millions and billions , it is important not to forget what official development assistance is really about			0
‘ we live in a world where one million babies a year die on their first and only day of life			0
one in eight people go to bed hungry each and every night			0
1.5 billion people are trapped in the brutality of conflict - affected and fragile states			0
58 million children are unable to go to school and 20,000 under - five - year - olds die every year of easily curable diseases			2
the support we give changes lives			0
’ the @entity38 was tabled by former @entity100 secretary @entity99 , who said it would deliver ‘ for the poorest in the world ’			2
the @entity38 , which was voted through by 164 to six , now goes to committee stage and then to the @entity53			0
all three major parties pledged to support the aid target in their manifestos , and it was part of the @entity206 agreement			0
the last @entity39 government made law legally - binding targets for child poverty and climate change			1
the 2008 @entity212 included the target of reducing the @entity3 ’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 per cent from its 1990 level by 2050			0
a 2010 law set a target of ‘ ending child poverty ’ by 2020			0
it is thought that any government not meeting the targets as set out in law could face a legal challenge requiring it to do so .			0

ministers today backed a bill making it legally - binding to spend 0.7 *%* on aid
commitment means the government will spend £ 12bn on aid next year
@entity59 mps said aid spending should not rise while defence was being cut
one conservative mp described it as a ' sop ' to ' guardian - reading liberals '
but @entity20 mp introducing the bill insisted it was ' the right thing to do '
@entity165 broke off campaigning in @entity100 to back plan in commons
