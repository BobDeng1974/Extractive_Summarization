an attempt to honour cricket legend @entity1 was blocked because of his conviction for assaulting a former lover for decades he has been known to fans of his dogged cricketing style as ‘ sir ’ @entity1			1
but an attempt by home secretary @entity8 to turn the affectionate tribute into a genuine knighthood was blocked by @entity12 officials because of @entity1 ’s conviction for assaulting a former lover , @entity6 has learned			1
the bid to honour the former @entity17 captain in the @entity19 list was vetoed by the @entity20 because of a furore dating back nearly two decades			2
the @entity23 batsman received a three - month suspended sentence and £ 5,300 fine from a @entity26 court in 1996 for pinning down his then lover , @entity27 , and punching her in the face			1
@entity1 , now 74 , denies ever hitting ms @entity27 , insisting that she slipped and injured herself after flying into a rage when he told her he was ‘ not the marrying kind ’			1
according to @entity34 guidelines , a criminal record should not in itself prevent a person from being considered for a knighthood as long as there is no ‘ outstanding issue ’			0
mrs may lent her name to the campaign to honour @entity1 , which was led by a group of cricket - loving @entity45 mps , only for it to be scuppered by officials			1
the mps , including @entity49 and fellow @entity51 @entity50 , sent letters to the @entity20 saying that @entity1 ’s record entitled him to join the pantheon of cricketing knights including sir @entity56			1
mrs may , @entity57 and @entity58 have all recently joined @entity1 on separate occasions to watch top - flight matches			0
boycott was the first @entity62 to score more than 8,000 @entity64 runs and still ranks as the country ’s sixth highest run scorer ever			1
@entity1 received a three - month suspended sentence and £ 5,300 fine from a @entity26 court in 1996 for pinning down his then lover , @entity27 ( pictured at the time , left , and in 2000 , right ) and punching her in the face the @entity20 is also believed to have received a submission on @entity1 ’s behalf from within @entity74 ’s @entity73 , but an official intervened to prevent it from being considered by the sporting honours committee , which is chaired by @entity77			1
@entity1 ’s allies point out that sir @entity79 received a knighthood in 2007 despite receiving a three - month suspension from cricket after being arrested for smoking cannabis in 1986 – although he was never charged with any offence			2
last night , mr @entity50 said : ‘ people in @entity23 have been calling him “ sir @entity1 ” for years , and i am hopeful that he will receive his due in future rounds			2
plenty of knights have been honoured after a brush with the @entity62 , let alone @entity91 , law			2
boycott was the first @entity62 to score more than 8,000 test runs and still ranks as the country ’s sixth highest run scorer ever ' he has done a tremendous amount of work for charity and has a lot of support on the floor of the @entity103 , at @entity20 level and in the @entity105 , but it sounds as if some jobsworth numpty who does n’t understand @entity1 ’s contribution to sport has let his pen get carried away			1
’ boycott – who did become the marrying kind when he married long - term lover @entity113 in 2003 – has been involved with cancer charities since fighting the disease a decade ago			0
@entity1 , who lived with his mother until he was 38 , was in an on - off relationship with @entity113 for more than three decades before they married			0
in a memoir published last year he said that he would not have survived his throat cancer without @entity113 ‘ being there for me ’			0
during his playing days , @entity1 took part in 108 tests and captained @entity17 four times , although his stubborn style of play and blunt manner often irritated his colleagues			0
@entity79 described him as ‘ totally , almost insanely , selfish ’ , and @entity1 once found himself dropped after scoring 246 – for batting too slowly			0
after retiring he became a cricket pundit , but was sacked in the wake of the @entity26 conviction			0
however , he has since rebuilt his career and now works on @entity133			0
on the night of his argument with ms @entity27 , the couple had spent the evening drinking champagne with singer @entity137 at the @entity138 in @entity139			1
the cricketer later failed to have his conviction set aside by a higher @entity26 court , but said afterwards : ‘ i am not guilty of hitting @entity27 and hope that the public have come to realise this			2
’ ms @entity27 reacted to the decision by saying she would be ‘ drinking champagne tonight ’			2
the @entity20 said : ‘ we can only comment on people who are on the @entity149 , not on names that do n’t appear			0
’ @entity1 did not respond to requests for comment .			0
