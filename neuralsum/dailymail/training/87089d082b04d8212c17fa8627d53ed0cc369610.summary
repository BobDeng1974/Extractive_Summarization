former armed forces chief @entity0 said thousands more soldiers are needed thousands of extra @entity6 troops are needed to fight @entity8 extremists around the world , the former head of the armed forces has warned			1
general lord @entity0 said the government sacked too many soldiers – leaving the @entity12 unable to tackle @entity13 and other fanatical groups			1
he also warned the prime minister that it would be a ‘ tall order ’ for the @entity18 to hunt down the @entity6 killer filmed beheading hostages @entity20 and @entity22			1
his remarks came after @entity24 ordered @entity6 ’s spy chiefs to find the @entity13 killer known as ‘ @entity27 ’ dead or alive			1
speaking to the @entity28 show this morning , lord @entity0 said : ‘ of course all of us in a visceral response to what 's happened would like to see that , ’ he said			1
‘ but as good as the @entity18 are , they are also rightly very cautious and i think to expect them to do that is a tall order and it needs to be part of this grander strategy			1
’ his remarks came after he attacked the government ’s military cuts , which will see the regular @entity12 cut from 102,000 serving soldiers to just 82,000			1
the cuts will be partially offset by an increase in the size of the @entity47 from 19,000 to 30,000			2
lord @entity0 , who stepped down last year , said the present strength was too small to deal with what the prime minister has called a ‘ generational struggle ’ against @entity53 extremists			1
‘ the reservist plan could yet be made to work within two or three years but we are now in a different era , ’ lord @entity0 told @entity55 's @entity54			1
‘ this needs to be put right quickly			0
if it can be then fine , i will go along with that solution			0
‘ but my instinct is it ca n't be and we need to go back to the drawing board and revise the size of the @entity12 back up again			2
‘ if we are talking about a generational struggle , as i think the prime minister is and he is absolutely right ... then we need an @entity12 that can sustain a demanding operation not just in @entity68 and @entity69 potentially , in a support role , but think of all the other places where @entity53 extremism is causing havoc			1
' he added : ‘ i am thinking @entity90 , @entity74 is very fragile , the countries around @entity68 that need more help like @entity78 and obviously @entity69 and perhaps @entity79			1
and then you go into @entity81 , @entity75 needs more assistance , even @entity84 leadership i saw talking about creating the same sort of problems in places like @entity88			0
‘ we have to see the grand strategic challenge which is confronting us all now and that , i 'm afraid , needs a grand strategic response of the type that our forebears dealt with			0
’ lord @entity0 said it was a ‘ no - brainer ’ that @entity6 operations should extend @entity98 operations from @entity69 into @entity68			1
‘ i am very clear that that is the view of the prime minister and most of his party			0
his problem is delivering the politics that allow us to do that , ’ he said			0
he said not enough was being done to train @entity69 and @entity68 ground forces to take on @entity106			1
‘ you either have to put your own boots on the ground at some point or else you have to very energetically and aggressively train up those who will do that with us and for us			0
my worry at the moment is that the scale of the challenge is n't being met by the right scale of response			0
‘ i am worried that without more intensive use of @entity123 boots on the ground in a support role then we wo n't do it in the time we need to get on and do this in			0
’ @entity24 praised @entity6 soldiers on a surprise visit to @entity81 last week			2
but he warned that the struggle against @entity8 terror would last a ' generation ' but , deputy prime minister @entity133 said he disagreed with the former army chief ’s remarks			2
he said @entity6 needed to take the threat from militant groups like is ‘ extremely seriously ’ , but added this may not necessarily require an increase in conventional forces			0
‘ how you respond to it is not quite as straightforward as @entity143 - much though i respect him - suggests			0
i do n't think it 's a question of simply ramping up conventional armed forces again as if we were fighting state - to - state conflicts			0
‘ increasingly what you are having is states co-operating together in a jigsaw operation where different countries bring to the effort different capabilities against stateless mobile groups			0
’ asked about joining @entity157 - led air strikes in @entity68 , he told @entity28 : ‘ i would n't advocate that we extend the air campaign into @entity68			2
‘ it wo n't come to a vote unless the government proposes it and the government is not proposing it right now			2
‘ we need to persuade the @entity6 people and @entity166 as well that every time we put servicemen and women in harm 's way we do so with a clear strategy in mind , and i think the combination of air strikes and ground forces needs to be properly thought through			0
‘ that was obvious in @entity69 , it 's a little more complicated in @entity68			2

government is cutting the @entity12 from 102,000 serving soldiers to just 82,000
general lord @entity0 said army needs to be increased to tackle @entity13
he claimed it was a ' no brainer ' to *launch* *airstrikes* in @entity68 as well as @entity69
also warned it would be a ' tall order ' for the @entity18 to hunt down ' @entity27 '
