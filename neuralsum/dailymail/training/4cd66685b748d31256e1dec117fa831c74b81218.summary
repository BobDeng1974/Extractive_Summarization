the ' art of pole dancing used to be confined to gentleman 's clubs and bars			1
more recently it has been adopted by the fitness industry as a fun way to tone up and build strength			2
and now street pole dancing is the latest fitness craze set to take the @entity11 by storm			1
for street pole dancers , lamp posts , road signs and even trees are the perfect stage for this dynamic new dance trend			1
combining elements of free running and street art , the discipline sees participants showing off impressive moves on pieces of street furniture			2
@entity28 , who runs pole dancing workshops in @entity30 , @entity27 said : ' once you start street pole dancing , you can never look at a lamp post in the same way again			1
' @entity28 of @entity35 , @entity30 practises street pole dancing on lamposts , trees and street signs @entity28 , who also works as a model , admitted some classes still encourage their pupils to work in strip club the 26 - year - old first encountered the concept when she completed a pole dancing course in @entity46 earlier in the year			1
she said : ' all the girls were really into it			0
i was a bit embarrassed to start with , because i did n't want anyone to see when i fell flat on my face			0
' you do get a bit of a crowd around you			0
i had an elderly couple watching me recently , but i think they were more intrigued than disapproving			0
i could see them wondering what on earth i was doing			0
' the movement started in @entity46 five years ago , when a group of pole dancers started to meet for regular ' jams ' , which involved sharing moves outside			2
a spokesman for the group said : ' it took us many years to realise that mediocre street furniture has great joys to offer			2
' street pole dancing can be practiced by anyone			1
you can do it on your own , but it really makes more sense and is safer when people jam together , swapping moves , encouraging and inspiring each other			0
' the 26 - year - old first encountered the concept when she completed a pole dancing course in @entity46 earlier in the year combining elements of free running and street art , the discipline sees participants showing off impressive moves on pieces of street furniture taking her inspiration from the @entity46 scene , @entity28 decided to set up a group in @entity30 last month and already has more than 80 regular members			1

people are starting to hear about how great it is fitness-wise			0
more and more groups are springing up in smaller communities			0
' anyone of any size , shape or age can get involved			0
you do n't need to be strong			0
i am quite small , but you start to build up strength so quickly			0
' the dancer , from @entity35 , who is mostly self - taught , first became interested in the discipline when she got bored of going to the gym two years ago			2
keen to distance pole dancing from its bad reputation , she said : ' pole dancing is no longer associated with sleazy strip clubs , but is now seen as a popular form of recreational and even competitive sport			1
' after beating more than 100 competitors to win an international street pole dancing competition last month , @entity28 will be jetting off to @entity122 in august to the @entity123 in @entity124			1
= but @entity28 , who also works as a model , admitted some classes still encourage their pupils to work in strip clubs			2
she said : ' when i first went to a class , they were pushing us towards working in bars			0
if you were good enough , you got a job in a bar and that 's what dancers were striving towards			2
' she added : ' i am slim and blonde and part of me thought perhaps it was a good idea , but the more i thought about it , the more it made me angry and upset that these teachers were encouraging young and impressionable girls to work in strip clubs			0
to me , pole dancing is purely about fitness and fun			1
