by @entity0 and @entity1 - parkinson published : 08:42 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 4 april 2013 when @entity3 bought this six - bedroom property on the cliffs after bidding just £ 154,500 at auction by telephone , she thought she had her dream home by the sea			1
but she had not viewed it or had it surveyed before buying – and six days later tons of rock at the bottom of the garden collapsed on to the beach below , leaving the house precariously close to the edge			2
yesterday , three years on , her dream finally came to a crashing end when another huge chunk of cliff collapsed , taking much of the 1930s house with it			1
a house that was bought for a knock - down price has fallen into the sea three years after @entity3 paid just £ 154,000 for it the sea turned red after a huge landslide at around 9pm on @entity29 night that took most of the house down the cliff with it the house has been sealed off for years after it was ruled to be ' structurally unsound ' but that advice was ignored by @entity35 who was the highest bidder in a telephone auction			1
the neighbour 's house in the background is believed to be safe from destruction from a distance the vulnerability of the clifftop houses becomes even more clear with hundreds of tonnes of earth falling into the sea so much sandstone fell 300ft into the bay at @entity49 that the sea turned bright red			1
miss @entity3 , 59 , a retired police officer from @entity51 , had tried to sue the builder from whom she bought @entity54 in february 2010			1
but the auction particulars had warned buyers the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair , and a judge ordered her to pay what she owed			1
the cliff fall in @entity62 is the latest around the @entity64 coast following strong winds , high tides and months of heavy rain			1
in @entity69 , the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged			2
at @entity72 , @entity71 , sea defences have been breached , cliff paths destroyed and a number of properties left vulnerable			2
the biggest cliff fall at the resort has seen a massive chunk of the coastline destroyed			1
the huge house seemed too good to be true at such a cheap price with more than enough room and beautiful views across the sea february 2013 : the house fell down slowly as the shifting earth under its foundations warped it and pulled the walls and floors in all directions but this was the scene just three years later when the land started falling from underneath it and into the sea below holidaymakers staying in caravans overlooking the sea reported hearing a crash like thunder as the cliff crumbled into the sea			1
three caravans had to be moved after they were left within feet of the cliff edge			0
part of a footpath that led down to the beach was swept away			0
@entity106 , the chairman of @entity107 , said : ‘ the coastline has deteriorated greatly in just the last two weeks			2
‘ the high winds combined with high tides mean that it is just disappearing			1
‘ the beach has lost so much sand , which means the sea defences have become weakened allowing the sea to hit the cliff			2
‘ the cliff has been slowly eroding , but this is the first time there has been a big fall right from the top to the bottom of the cliff			2
’ all that is now left is a couple of rooms in the house with the bulk of it strewn down the cliff along with the gardens of the house @entity129 , a pilot photographer , has taken pictures of the coast along @entity69 charting the places where the coastal erosion is happening			2
the images show caravans that are now just feet away from the cliff edge at @entity137 , near @entity138 , @entity139 , and are increasingly at risk of toppling over on to the sands below			0
@entity142 has also been blasted by wind - driven seas , with salt - killed trees left uprooted and strewn along the beach			0
further up at the coast at @entity72 , near @entity148 , the damage is even worse , with defences breached and cliff paths destroyed , leaving more and more properties vulnerable			0
@entity152 , @entity71 and @entity139 coastal engineer with the @entity154 , said easterly winds were partly to blame for the erosion			0
mr @entity152 said : ' over the last two weeks we have had persistent easterlies coming in , some of them quite strong			0
these tend to scour some beaches away			0
as a result we have recorded very low beach levels			0
that 's what we would mainly see in the winter			0
' caravans have been removed from their pitches close to the edge of a cliff that has fallen away despite sea defences these houses have also been abandoned due to their precarious position on the edge of the cliffs of @entity137 he said that by now beaches should be rebuilding after the annual winter battering and giving crucial protection to the coastline			1
but the freak icy spell , months of sub-zero temperatures and killer @entity184 winds had almost bludgeoned exposed beaches into submission			1
' once we get out of these easterlies we should start seeing calmer conditions and more constructive waves that will push sand back up the beach , ' said mr @entity152			0
he said responsibility for managing the stretch of coastline lay with @entity198			0
the authority is now working with the @entity154 to monitor the deepening crisis			0
but @entity139 's @entity201 ( @entity202 ) , which sets out how the coast will be protected , has outlined a policy of ' no active intervention ' for the hamlets of @entity207 and @entity208			0
as a result , defences will not be provided or maintained and the sea and winds will continue to take huge chunks out of the rapidly - disappearing coastline			1
a large section of @entity72 sea wall collapses into the sea , speeding up the problem of coastal erosion dead trees are uprooted and strewn along the beach after the sea claimed yet more or the land because of the extended cold period			1

@entity3 bought @entity54 in a telephone auction without carrying out structural survey
three years later and the house has finally fallen into the sea after the land disappeared from under it
@entity232 fall is the latest around the coastline after strong winds , high tides and months of heavy rain
