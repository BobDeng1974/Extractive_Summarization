quick thinking : @entity23 ( left ) used a passer by 's belt as a tourniquet to strap up the leg of her sister @entity8 ( right ) after she was hit by a car doctors later told the pair that ms @entity8 would have bled to death if ms @entity15 had not acted so swiftly			1
ms @entity8 said : ' thank @entity33 did what she did , i ’m so grateful to her			1
she literally saved my life			0

' but @entity39 kept telling me off and told me not to speak like that , ' she said			0
the sisters both work at @entity52 in @entity14 and were walking home to ms @entity15 's house to prepare for a charity party when the crash happened			1

' at first we thought it was a boy racer			0
the sound was loud enough to make us both look up			0
as we did , right in front of us a car mounted the pavement , it all happened so quickly			2
' ms @entity15 was thrown onto the road by the car and was left with a chipped kneecap and badly bruised hands			2
but ms @entity8 took the full force of the impact and was hurled several metres along the pavement - leaving bone protruding from her right leg			1
' the car only stopped when it hit a telegraph pole and it was still accelerating when it came to a halt , ' said ms @entity8			1
' my first reaction was to try and stand up due to the adrenaline and shock , but i soon realised the bone was sticking out of my leg and i could n’t lift it at all			0
i do n’t think anything can get close to the pain i felt , it was absolute agony			0
' ms @entity8 said she was screaming loudly and was convinced her leg had gone and there was nothing that could be done to save it			1
despite her own injuries , ms @entity15 went to her sister ’s aid and asked a man who was walking past the scene if she could use his belt			1
paramedics then rushed her to @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , for emergency vascular surgery before being transferred to @entity116 , @entity117			0
ms @entity8 , of @entity64 , @entity14 , was facing the prospect of amputation but doctors re-built her leg with skin from her back and left leg			1
she said : ' the possibility of losing my whole leg hung over me for several weeks			0
' one of the @entity129 ( @entity130 ) doctors said it was one of the worst lower limb injuries they ’d ever seen			2
it was touch and go for a while but they managed to save my leg			0
' close : ms @entity8 ( right ) has praised ms @entity15 ( left ) for her actions			1
she said the incident has brought the pair closer together she spent about three weeks in hospital before coming home where she was bed bound for about five months			2
' my right leg is now slightly shorter due to bone loss and i have had to learn to walk again , ' she said			2
before the accident i only ever wore skirts and leggings but now i have to wear trousers all the time			0
' @entity39 , who still works at @entity52 , said she often replayed the moment in her head			0
she said : ' every day i walk past the scene and try to make sense of what happened			0
' i wish i could have responded by pushing her out of the way but everything happened so @entity158 just did the only thing i could think of to help her			0
' pensioner @entity57 , 90 , of @entity160 , @entity14 , was banned from driving indefinitely on november 23 after pleading guilty to careless driving at @entity162			2
