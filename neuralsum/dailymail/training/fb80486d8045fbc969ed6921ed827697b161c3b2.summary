the stunning image was captured as @entity5 and girlfriend @entity12 were flying over @entity13 in @entity14 in a light aircraft			1
just days later @entity5 proposed - and he is now certain it acted as the inspiration for his life - changing decision			1
nature 's love symbol : an image of thousands of lesser flamingos flying over the lake bed in the shape of a heart in @entity14 inspired wildlife snapper @entity5 , 48 , to propose to girlfriend @entity12 @entity28 @entity5 , who lives in @entity29 , said : ' while standing in , walking through or flying over the shallow waters of these lakes , large concentrations of these flamingos will often miraculously take on familiar shapes			1
' sometimes these shapes seem to be sending cryptic messages			0
while flying with my girlfriend beside me , a huge concentration of flying flamingos below us magically took on the shape of a heart			2
' it 's hard to know whether this was a factor that led to my proposal of marriage a few days later which was accepted - but looking back , i think it probably was			0
' thousands of flamingos walking through the shallow waters in the shape of a devil 's tail at @entity54 in @entity14 - one of several amazing pictures taken by @entity5 the formations throw up any number of interesting shapes , including in this snap where it looks like they have formed the outline of @entity63 the formations can include up to 100,000 birds , which descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on the birds in a snake - like formation			1
@entity5 says the weird and wonderful shapes only last for a matter of seconds before the birds scatter and fly in another direction the couple met in 2001 on a diving boat in the @entity77 and it was n't long before they tied the knot			1
ever since they have travelled the world taking more snaps of the beautiful birds			0
in one , several of the brightly coloured birds appear to take the shape of a mushroom , while another shows the rough outline of a shark like creature			0
a close - up of the birds in a v - formation			0
@entity5 has refined his technique to capture the shapes in time			2
' i have learnt to be on the lookout for these shapes and have trained myself to shoot rapidly with my camera when they occur ' @entity5 and @entity12 have travelled the world photographing wildlife and most of their best images have been captured from the air @entity5 said : ' it is not easy as the light aircraft i shoot from are buffeted by wind turbulence , while i 'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from falling out ' each one consists of up to a hundred thousand @entity115 , who descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on			1
@entity5 added : ' i have been privileged to spend many hours flying in a light aircraft , with doors removed on one side , over @entity63 's soda lakes			2
often , especially in the case of flying flamingos , these patterns will take shape for only the briefest of periods			0
' over the years i have learnt to be on the lookout for these shapes and have trained myself to shoot rapidly with my camera when they occur			0
' it is not easy as the light aircraft that i shoot from is constantly been buffeted by wind turbulence , while i 'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from plummeting several hundred feet to the ground			0
' @entity5 and @entity12 pose in @entity29			1
after capturing the amazing formation , he is convinced it was nature 's way of telling him he should propose , and now the pair are happily married			2
