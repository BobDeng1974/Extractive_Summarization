on trial : @entity1 , 49 , from @entity2 , believes he has been made a complete scapegoat a male nurse accused of murdering three patients by tampering with saline drips has been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ because someone had to ‘ carry the can ’ after a massive police hunt , a court heard yesterday			1
a jury has already heard how @entity1 , 49 , also left another patient brain damaged by secretly injecting insulin into drips , turning them into ‘ ticking timebombs ’ to be used by unwitting colleagues			1
the prosecution alleges that @entity1 became the prime suspect after maliciously altering patients ’ prescription charts six months later in january 2012 in a bid to trick colleagues at @entity25 in @entity2 into giving them potentially fatal doses			1
yesterday , however , @entity1 ’s barrister claimed he had been ‘ plucked ’ out of a ‘ huge number ’ of people who could all have been the poisoner , and it had merely been his ‘ misfortune ’ to be working on the ward on the night the prescriptions were falsified			2
‘ the police put huge resources into investigating what happened at @entity25 with a vast number of officers , ’ @entity34 , @entity35 , said			2
‘ can they end up at the end of the day saying “ i do n’t know who did it ? ” somebody at the end of the day has to carry the can			0
‘ the defence say , when you look at it , this man is a scapegoat			0
he is being blamed when it could have been anyone			0
’ mr @entity34 told @entity54 there was no evidence linking @entity1 to the tampered records			1
he said @entity1 ‘ had the misfortune to be one of a number of people on duty ’ that night , and as a result , ‘ whoops , the finger of suspicion goes back on him ’			0
victims : @entity68 , 44 and @entity69 , 71 , died at @entity25 in @entity2 in 2011			1
@entity1 is accused of their murders possible victim : @entity73 after ‘ a couple of years on bail ’ , he said , ‘ they decide to charge him and he ends up here ’			2
should the jury conclude that the insulin contamination and the altered prescriptions were not the work of the same person , the prosecution case would be ‘ like a ship that has been holed ’ , he added			0
mr @entity34 said the defence would argue that whoever did contaminate medical products with insulin , did not necessarily want to harm patients			0
instead the poisoner could have wanted to cause ‘ hassle ’ and create extra work for senior staff , he added			0
he said the defence would also argue that the insulin was not a significant factor in the deaths of the patients – but stressed that @entity1 denies being responsible			1
@entity100 - born @entity1 , a married father of two , faces a total of 36 charges including the murders of @entity68 , 44 , @entity69 , 71 , and @entity73 , 83			1
