but for premature baby @entity6 , his first birthday is not only a milestone , but a miracle			1
@entity6 was declared dead by doctors for 25 minutes after he stopped breathing - but miraculously came back to life			1
he stopped breathing in an incubator a day into his life , after being born at just 26 weeks , when he failed to breathe without the help of a ventilator			1
survivor : @entity17 holds @entity6 when he is just a month old at @entity19 , @entity20 doctors and nurses battled to stabilise @entity6 as he fought for life struggling to breath with his barely formed lungs miracle boy : @entity6 looks on at his first birthday cake - which no one expected after his heart stopped for 25 minutes @entity30 was born weighing just 1lb 14oz but has since gone from strength to strength nurses at @entity19 , @entity20 , could not revive him and informed parents @entity17 , 39 , and @entity36 , 44 , the toddler had passed away			1
but as they prepared for a chaplain to christen the baby they noticed he still had a faint heartbeat and rushed him back into intensive care			1
now he has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family and friends , overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one - year - old boy			2
@entity17 and @entity36 from @entity46 , @entity47 , who had been trying for a baby for 18 years and had six miscarriages said his life was meant to be			1
@entity17 said : ' the nurses told us he had gone and that there was no vital signs of life			1
i asked them to keep trying but they said it was no use			0
tiny : his parents were devastated to learn their little boy had died - but his heart started beating again and the little boy , seen here aged one month , grew stronger and stronger what a trooper ! @entity6 plays happily just before his first birthday last week , a year after he was given up for dead boy wonder ! @entity6 has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family , who are overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one - year - old ' we held him for 20 minutes taking it in turns and saying our goodbyes thinking we ’d lost @entity6 forever			1
' they said there might still be movement in him from the gasses in his body but he was there and just still			0
we had no idea he would start breathing again			0
' we wanted him christened and as they took him away the nurses rushed back a few minutes later and said he was breathing again			0
' we watched them rig him back up to the ventilator and oxygen			0
' i just turned around stunned and i literally slid down the wall in shock			0
' @entity36 and i could n’t believe it			1
we think it was maybe moving him so much in preparation for the christening that re-started his heart			0
after 18 years of trying for a baby , @entity36 and @entity17 were thrilled when @entity6 - seen here in a high dependency care - pulled through milestone : @entity36 , @entity17 and @entity6 at his christening , months after nurses told them that their little boy died ' being that small how could he survive ? at that age you have n’t developed proper lungs			1
it ’s amazing he came back			0
' the nurses said he ’s fighting back but we just do n’t know how long for			0
' it was still 50/50 for weeks he would make it through but he did			2
' he has has been labelled ‘ the event ’ by staff at the hospital after the amazing back from the dead incident that doctors say they have never witnessed			0
medics can still not understand how @entity6 , who weighed just 1lb 14oz at birth , had the lung capacity to breathe again after his heart stopped			1
but after reviving him and keeping him on a ventilator and oxygen for the eight weeks after the incident , he pulled through to now live a healthy first year			1
nothing gets in his way : @entity6 died in an incubator a day into his life at just 26 weeks old and nurses could not revive him - but now he is fighting fit after his miraculous recovery growing up fast ! @entity6 , seen at nine months old at his playgroup , ' fought all the way and he ¿ s here now a beautiful baby ' he also survived four blood transfusions , bleeds on the brain and a hole in the heart which is common to premature children			1
@entity17 and @entity36 first lost a child in 1996 but did not discover until 2001 that @entity17 had polycystic ovaries that meant it was unlikely she could be pregnant with a child for longer than 37 weeks			1
despite the concerns , she endured a normal pregnancy with @entity6 for six months until september 12 last year when he arrived with no warning			1
@entity17 said : ' i had back ache and doctors said they suspected it was an infection and to put my feet up and get some rest			2
@entity6 will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development @entity17 said : ' after 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through , i wouldn ¿ t change it for the world ' ' within hours though i was fully dilated and they said the baby ’s head is ready to arrive			1
it was a bolt from the blue			0
' they said he had a 60 to 70 per cent chance of survival but it all depended on him breathing on his own			0
' i never bought anything baby wise in the lead up to his birth , i did n’t want to tempt fate and we chose not to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl			2
' before we conceived they told me the more weight i lost the better the chance i would have of mothering a child so i set about losing as much as possible			2
' we lost twins in 2002 and then had four other miscarriages			0
' but after 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through , i would n’t change it for the world			1
' @entity6 was allowed home first time on november 30 last year , 11 weeks after his remarkable recovery			1
he has only had to return once since for a bout of tonsillitis			0
he will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development			2
otherwise , he now happily plays at his local nursery with children his own age			0
@entity17 said : ' if you do n’t tell people , they ’d never know just how premature he was			2
he was crawling and sitting up before many children his age do and he ’s all set to start walking in the next few weeks			0
' the hospital was fantastic			0
we can not praise the staff there enough for they did for us and @entity6			2
' he fought all the way and he ’s here now a beautiful baby			0
