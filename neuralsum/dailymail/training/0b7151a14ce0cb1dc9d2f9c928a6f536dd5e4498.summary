by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 1 may 2013 hormone replacement therapy could do your muscles a power of good , according to researchers			0
they found it significantly improves muscle function , right down to the muscle fibre level			1
a study which put muscle fibres under the microscope found cells were arranged differently in post-menopausal women taking @entity15 compared with those who did not			1
the difference reduced age - related changes and improved muscle function , the researchers said			1
a new study has found @entity15 significantly improves muscle function an estimated one million women in the @entity22 are prescribed @entity15 in their 50s to replace oestrogen lost in the menopause			1
it can combat symptoms such as hot flushes and mood changes			0
@entity15 is known to slow bone loss and increase bone density , and reverse declining levels of skin collagen , which is responsible for the stretch in skin and muscle			1
previous studies have suggested @entity15 reduces the drop in muscle mass and strength in post-menopausal women , improving the ability to jump higher and walk faster than those not taking drugs			2
the latest study , in @entity45 , is the first to explore these effects at cellular and molecular levels to find how the changes are occurring			0
researchers at @entity51 observed six pairs of post-menopausal identical twins – of whom only one of each pair was receiving @entity15 – to rule out genetic differences			2
they then examined muscle biopsies taken from them , says a report published in @entity59			0
women take @entity15 to combat symptoms such as hot flushes and mood changes they found @entity15 had a significant effect on slow - twitch muscle fibres , enabling cells to work more efficiently			1
dr @entity67 , from @entity51 , said negative publicity over the past decade has made many women reluctant to use @entity15 , but the study shows a positive outcome			0
he said : ‘ even though individual muscle fibres did not change in size , the muscles of @entity15 users showed greater strength by generating a higher maximum force compared to @entity79 users			2
it is thought that using @entity15 , at least in part , reduces modifications of muscle contractile proteins that are linked to ageing			2
‘ @entity15 is also associated with a more efficient organisation of myonuclei , which are essential components for muscle fibre function			1
’ experts last year reappraised hrt risks after claims that users were at higher risk of breast cancer , heart disease and strokes – contrary to previous research suggesting oestrogen protected them from heart problems			0
re-analysis of data from the @entity103 women ’s health initiative found the extra health risks applied to older patients in their 60s and 70s , who do not normally use @entity15 but were given it for research purposes			0
it showed women taking @entity15 at the start of the menopause for ten years can reduce their risk of heart failure , heart attacks and premature death .			0

those who took @entity15 had reduced age - related changes and improved muscle function
