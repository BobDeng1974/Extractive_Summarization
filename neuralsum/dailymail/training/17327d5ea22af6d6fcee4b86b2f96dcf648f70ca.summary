by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 18:45 est , 15 february 2014 no gain , just pain : @entity5 , 33 , suffered burns after a ' fat - freezing ' treatment after an ‘ horrendous ’ divorce , @entity8 decided to boost her confidence with a cosmetic treatment – and picked one that promised permanent fat reduction in just one session of ‘ freezing ’			1
but instead of returning home with a sleeker silhouette and a spring in her step , she was left burned , in agony , and possibly scarred			1
only afterwards did @entity5 , 33 , discover the practitioner who carried out the botched ‘ fat freezing ’ procedure last month at the @entity25 skin clinic , in @entity26 , was actually trained as a hairdresser			1
the case emerged last week as the government faced heavy criticism for failing to regulate the cosmetic treatment industry despite a major review and a campaign by @entity34			1
@entity5 is now considering legal action against the clinic , which she found through a discount voucher site offering prices reduced from £ 1,200 to a tempting £ 169 to treat two areas on her stomach			2
it is the sort of hard - sell tactic this newspaper is calling to see stamped out , as it puts undue pressure on potential patients			1
yet the @entity47 has failed to address this issue			2
the treatment @entity5 underwent , marketed as an alternative to liposuction , targets specific problem areas using a machine - based probe that freezes fat cells through the skin until they apparently die and are metabolised by the body			1
but within hours , the skin on @entity5 ’s stomach went from feeling numb and white with cold to blisteringly hot and bright red			2
the inflammation was so painful she felt sick			2
‘ it was worse than sunburn , ’ she said			2
‘ i could n’t stand , sit or lie because movement or anything touching the affected area felt like being poked by a hot iron			2
@entity69 was impossible because i could n’t bear even a sheet on top of me			2
’ she contacted the clinic and sent the pictures of the ever darkening lesions on her abdomen			1
but in the clinic told her : ‘ we know it does rarely occur after treatment			1
it looks like a superficial infection			2
’ the clinic advised @entity5 to keep the area clean and take painkillers			2
later , they suggested applying an antibiotic cream			2
a week later , in despair , @entity5 saw her gp , who confirmed she had serious burns – akin to frostbite			2
the doctor was able only to offer cream to prevent infection			2
‘ the intense pain lasted six days , during which time the skin began to blister and i was n’t able to sleep or work , ’ said @entity5 , who runs her own graphic design and marketing agency in @entity96 on the @entity97			1
‘ it felt like i had been branded			0
’ and she may well be left with a permanent reminder of the procedure as she has been told it is too early to predict if her skin will fully recover			1
‘ i do n’t know if there ’s nerve damage , ’ @entity5 added			0
‘ when i grab that flesh with my fingers , it ’s completely numb			0

’ when contacted by @entity34 , @entity25 manager @entity186 admitted her therapist was only qualified as a hairdresser			1
later , he tried to retract his statement , saying it was incorrect because he was ‘ caught on the hop ’			0
he also claimed that the ‘ therapist ’ was fully trained in using the machine			1
the @entity47 last week pledged to set up a committee of doctors to help the @entity196 make cosmetic surgery a speciality in its own right			1
this was in response to last year ’s @entity202 of the @entity203 , which called for a major overhaul in regulation			0
but the government fell short of saying there should be a requirement for those offering these operations to become specialists , meaning doctors still would not need to be qualified in cosmetic surgery in order to perform it			1
and there was widespread dismay that those offering non-surgical treatments , such as @entity219 , fillers , lasers and fat reduction , would not be brought into line			1
instead , non-medical professionals – including hairdressers – will continue to be able to offer and carry out these life - changing procedures			1
@entity227 targets specific problem areas using a machine - based probe that freezes fat cells through the skin until they apparently die and are metabolised by the body @entity233 , former president of the @entity234 , believes @entity5 ’s case again highlights how @entity237 patients are being left wide open to the horrifying consequences of cowboy cosmetic practitioners			1
he said : ‘ this new guidance from the @entity47 is yet another missed opportunity to protect patients			0
it beggars belief that an untrained operator can be put in charge of aesthetic medical equipment , with the result that a woman may now be permanently scarred			1
‘ and the involvement of voucher sites is outrageous			0
you would n’t go to a voucher site for a hip replacement , so why would you use it for an aesthetic medical treatment ? ’ @entity5 added : ‘ i was n’t expecting miracles , just a kickstart to a new fitness regime and i did my research on this treatment without finding a bad review			2
the clinic ’s address , in @entity264 in @entity26 , is known as the @entity265 , and that reassured me , too			0
’ the clinic referred to the treatment as @entity269 , according to @entity25 ’s website , is ‘ a celebrity favourite ’ and has ‘ numerous clinical trials citing its effectiveness ’			2
but @entity227 is a trademark of @entity275 company @entity227 , for the fat - freezing process it pioneered as its own treatment , @entity227			1
@entity227 does have clinical trials to support its claims , as well as approval from @entity275 regulators the @entity282			0
yet @entity227 said it never sold any of its equipment to @entity25			0
the firm added : ‘ we would be concerned to discover that a hairdresser would be involved in a treatment using @entity227 technology			1
our providers are all fully qualified , leading plastic surgeons , dermatologists and medical aesthetic specialists			0
’ the company is particularly worried about copycat or counterfeit devices that do not have a ‘ kill switch ’ to detect and stop treatment when skin has reached a temperature beyond which damage can occur			1
starbright has told @entity5 it has n’t had any other clients report similar injury			0
but she argues this is little consolation if she ends up scarred			2
she added : ‘ after years of having my confidence knocked , i ’d just started dating again but i ca n’t take my clothes off in front of anyone now			0
i just hope other women think twice about purchasing treatments through voucher sites			0
