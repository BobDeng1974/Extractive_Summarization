by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 12:34 est , 8 october 2013 a thief has been caught on camera stealing a wallet containing £ 450 from a vulnerable 97 - year - old man			1
a thin 5ft 6in woman of eastern @entity7 or @entity8 descent was captured by @entity10 distracting pensioner @entity9 by asking him for the time			1
while the obliging man looked at his watch , she swiped his wallet which contained his £ 450 of his pension from his jacket pocket before walking off and putting on a white hat			2
polite enquiry : the thief asks mr @entity9 for the time posing to be a friendly stranger wicked : she walks away with then elderly man 's wallet in her hand			1
it contained £ 450 of his pension in cash a possible male accomplice is also seen near the scene of the crime on @entity31 in @entity33 ’s @entity32 , @entity34			1
the stress of the incident is believed to have led to mr @entity9 being rushed to @entity37 for treatment on a blood clot in his left leg			1
fortunately the victim pulled through but his family believe the traumatic ordeal led to his health deteriorating			2
at one stage , they were warned he may not survive			2
the distraught pensioner has since vowed never to return to the shopping arcade again , even though it was his only outing every week			2
walk of shame : the woman picks up pace as she strides away from the pensioner who is unaware he has been a victim of the crime suspects : another man wearing a long black coat and cap , above right , has been identified as a potential accomplice mr @entity9 ’s great nephew @entity61 today said : ' my biggest worry is that this woman does it again to another elderly , vulnerable person			1
' it could end up being life - threatening for someone of that age but these thieves do n’t think about that			0
' he has ended up in hospital possibly as a result of the theft because doctors believe the stress could have triggered it all			0
it is disgusting what she has done			0
' he was obviously frail and vulnerable , he had his white stick with him , and yet she still struck			0
this has really knocked him and changed his life			0
it may have even shortened it			0
fear : mr @entity9 insists that he will no longer venture to the shopping arcade despite it being his only trip out of the house ' we just hope that if anyone recognises her from the images that they will come forward and help stop her from doing it again			1
' the distraction theft is similar to those carried out by fellow eastern @entity7 and spotted by cameras in the @entity101 capital of @entity102 last week			1
at least three members of a @entity105 gang were seen trying to distract and steal money from a bespectacled pensioner as he withdrew money from a cashpoint			0
in @entity111 , distraction thefts are commonly associated with gangs of organised petty thieves			0
this year cashpoint card snatches were said to have treble with @entity117 crime gangs responsible for 92 per cent of thefts from cash machines .			0
