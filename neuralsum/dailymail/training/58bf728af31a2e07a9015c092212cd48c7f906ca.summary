by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 00:56 est , 22 march 2012 police were called to a @entity3 highway early on sunday morning because concerned citizens saw a young boy riding his bike alongside cars and trucks			1
they then discovered that the boy was running away from a very dysfunctional home			2
the seven - year - old boy , whose name has not been released , eventually told police where he lived and they escorted him back to his home where they spoke with his mother , @entity17 , and her father , @entity18			1
not only were they allegedly abusive to the boy and his two siblings , but they were also believed to be involved in an incestuous relationship with each other			2

‘ they did n’t know how he got out , ’ the police report states			0
a continued investigation into the family suggested that @entity18 , 54 , and @entity17 , 26 , had a sexual relationship and were the parents of the two - year - old boy found in the @entity42 home			1
