@entity0 is among the top 1,000 most active @entity2 editors for his dedication to correcting the misuse of the phrase ' comprised of ' as grammatical errors go , it is perhaps so obscure that most people would read on without giving it a second thought			1
but the misuse of the term ' comprised of ' bothers one obsessive @entity2 editor so much , he has spent nearly a decade correcting the mistake 47,000 times			1
software engineer @entity0 , known online as @entity15 , spends an hour every sunday evening fixing between 70 and 80 cases of the error that have appeared on @entity2 over the previous week			1
using software the 51 - year - old designed himself , he sends a request to @entity2 's server for articles containing the phrase , @entity18 reported			2
pages containing it are then extracted and compared to a database of articles he has edited in the past six months			2
any matches between the two sets of results are then removed from his list , in order to avoid bothering editors who have become overprotective of their pages			0
links for the remaining articles are then presented for him to click through , edit and upload - a process which takes approximately ten seconds for every correction			2
despite making the fixes reasonably quickly , mr @entity0 says that is down to having practiced the art since 2007			1
he said : ' an edit typically takes about ten seconds , but that ’s because i ’ve gotten really , really good at it			0
' i ’m actually putting a lot of thought into those ten seconds			0
some of them take a lot longer ; some of them take minutes			0
' the essay written by mr @entity0 and published on @entity2 which explains his obsessive amount of intervention mr @entity0 claims the phrase ' comprised of ' is ' completely unnecessary '			1
he said : ' there are many other ways to say what the writer means by " comprised of "			0
it adds nothing to the language			0
' the @entity2 user suggests ' composed of ' or ' consists of ' as possible alternatives to the forbidden phrase			1
mr @entity0 's argument is that ' to comprise ' means to include , as in : ' @entity70 comprises all of @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
' by this definition , the phrase ' @entity70 is comprised of ... ' does not make sense			0
remarkably , his case for why it is ungrammatical is laid out in a 6,000 - word essay in which he claims it stems from confusion between the phrases ' composed of ' and ' comprised '			1
within the essay , he also responds to critics who have regularly labelled him a pedant			0
he writes : ' i wo n't offer a rebuttal of that , because an individual editor 's allocation of his time should n't be anyone else 's concern			0
' his grammar campaign has not been welcomed by everyone , with some @entity2 page creators reverting his edits			2
one user erased his changes on 30 pages , in the same order which he made them			0
despite making the fix 47,000 times , mr @entity0 is still only scrapes into @entity2 's top 1,000 contributors - in 978th place			1
the top editor - going by the name @entity109 - has made almost 1.5million edits .			2
