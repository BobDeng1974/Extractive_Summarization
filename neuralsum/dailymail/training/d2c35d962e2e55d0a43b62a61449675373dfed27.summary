@entity1 number one @entity0 insists the desire to redress the balance in @entity5 history means the event will not be diminished by @entity8 's recent dominance over the @entity9			1
the 16 1/2 to 11 1/2 victory at @entity11 was their eighth in 10 attempts , but with the overall record in @entity9 's favour the @entity15 knows there is still a long way to go			1
@entity8 still trail 25 - 12 in terms of victories and captain @entity22 used a graphic depicting the divide as a motivational tool this week			1
it was celebrations all around as @entity0 helped @entity8 win the @entity5 the @entity29 star ( centre ) lifts the @entity5 with his team - mates ' we have an image in our team room and it shows how much red , white and blue is still on it , ' said the 25 - year - old			1
' if you look at the honours board of the @entity5 , @entity9 have still won a lot more than @entity8 and that 's what we 're going towards			1
' okay , we have won eight of the last 10 or seven of the last eight or whatever it is , but we are still very much behind the @entity9 in terms of @entity44 won			2
' that is our goal and our main objective to catch them up and overtake them as quickly as we can			0
' i do n't think this ( their recent record ) diminishes the competitive aspect of the @entity5 at all			2
' even though we 've won the majority of the last 10 , a lot of them have been very competitive			0
the last two @entity44 previous to this one @entity8 only won two of the sessions			2
@entity0 ( right ) and @entity59 celebrate after the @entity5 victory the world no.1 is lifted up on the green after @entity8 thrashed @entity9 in the @entity5 ' at @entity63 we had to combine two sessions and have all players out on the course and we won that session 5½ to ½ , and then everyone saw what we did in the singles at @entity71			1
' those were very tight matches			0
i have no doubt that come @entity75 in a couple years ' time it will be a tight match again			0
' the @entity5 will go on long past the years we are living			0
it 's a great spectacle of sport between two very competitive teams : @entity8 have just been getting the better of the @entity9 the last few years , but that 's not to mean that the @entity9 wo n't bounce back and win a few over the next five or six			1
" in terms of personal satisfaction @entity0 said the @entity5 victory provided the icing on the cake after adding two majors to his growing collection earlier in the year			2
coincidentally the last man to achieve such a feat was @entity90 , the defeated @entity9 captain , in 1977			0
@entity0 holds up a @entity29 flag with compatriot @entity92 the victor offers his hand to the vanquished @entity95 , a close friend off the course @entity0 said : ' it 's obviously a nice honour to have			1
it 's the icing on the cake of what has been a very special summer for me , to win back - to - back majors , the @entity99 and then the @entity100 , and then to be a part of this fantastic team led by a wonderful captain			0
' i could n't have asked for the summer to end any better			0
i did n't know that it had not been done since 1977 but , you know , if it 's not me in a couple years ' time again , i hope it 's one of these guys ( his team - mates ) that gets two majors and gets a @entity5			2
' @entity0 revealed he approached his singles match against good friend @entity95 with more focus than the final rounds of the @entity99 and @entity9 @entity100 , which he won this year , and that resulted in a comfortable 5 & 4 victory which helped @entity8 to an overall ' i personally am just really proud of how i played , ' said the @entity15			1
' i was probably up for this match more than i was the final two rounds of the majors i won this year			0
' it just meant so much to be to be a part of this team and to win			0

@entity8 's 16½ - 11½ victory means they have now won eight of the last 10 @entity5
but @entity8 still trail @entity9 25 - 12 in the overall *standings*
world no.1 @entity0 beat close friend @entity95 5 & 4 on *sunday*
he is not *worried* the event will be diminished by @entity8 's recent dominance
