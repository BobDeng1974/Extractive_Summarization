@entity0 today hailed a sharp fall in inflation to its lowest level since may 2000 for helping family incomes go further			1
the chancellor said the economic recovery was now being ' widely felt , after a supermarket price war and falling petrol prices meant the @entity10 rate of inflation fell to its lowest point for almost 15 years			1
with wages now rising faster than bills , ministers hailed the news as a ' giant tax cut for the economy ' with family incomes now going further each month			1
the @entity10 rate of inflation fell to 0.5 per cent in december , the lowest level since may 2000 , according to the @entity23 the @entity24 is the measure of the increase in living costs over a year			1
it takes into account every aspect of daily life , including housing bills , food , transport and recreation			0
lower inflation means bills are not rising as quickly , and some areas prices are falling			1
in addition to food and petrol bills falling , gas and electricity bills barely rose last month unlike last year when the @entity44 came under fire for large price hikes			1
the fall in inflation will ease pressure on household budgets as it boosts real - terms pay as well as pushing further into the future any need to raise interest rates			2
mr @entity0 said : ' today we have welcome news that inflation is at its lowest level in modern times , we have family budgets going further , an economic recovery now being widely felt			1
' but he cautioned : ' we 've got to remain vigilant that we have low inflation for the right reasons , this is further proof that our long term economic plan is working			1
' prime minister @entity67 hailed the ' good news ' which he said was proof that the government 's economic plan was working the figures will be welcome news for @entity67 and @entity0 , who were seen leaving @entity74 today @entity76 governor @entity75 has said that the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent was ' good news in the short term for @entity82 households '			1
but acknowledged the dangers that could be posed by it turning negative			0
he told the @entity86 that interest rates were still on course to rise over the next couple of years despite the drop in the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) measure to a record low			2
but he said that any rate hikes would be more gradual and more limited than had been expected a year ago			0
mr @entity75 said : ' by and large these figures are good news in the short term for @entity82 households			2
' it 's largely caused by lower petrol prices and lower food prices			2
that means your pound is going to stretch farther - lower prices at the pump and in the shops			0
' the issue is to make sure that this does n't become more generalised and that we do n't see low and falling prices more generally , because a little bit of inflation is good for the economy , it greases the wheels of the economy			1
' the fall below 1 per cent means @entity76 governor @entity75 has to write to mr @entity0 because it is more than a percentage point off the the @entity118 per cent target			0
@entity76 policy - makers have said they expected @entity10 to fall below 1 per cent and remain there for months to come			0
it means any rise in interest rates is likely to be delayed , providing a welcome boost to home owners paying off their mortgages			0
but the sharpness of the decline brings the @entity82 uncomfortably close to the scenario in the eurozone , where there are fears of a damaging deflationary spiral after inflation fell to minus 0.2 per cent			0
@entity136 chief secretary to the treasury said : ' these figures show that the falling price of oil is working its way into lower prices			1
' this acts like a giant tax cut for the economy , putting more money in the pockets of hard pressed consumers			1
' the @entity23 said that in 2014 food prices fell by 1.9 per cent and prices of motor fuels fell by 10.5 per cent			0
' historically , these prices have been among the main causes of inflation , though this has changed in the last year , ' the @entity23 said			0
@entity154 was one of the biggest causes of the fall in inflation , down 0.2 per cent overall between november and december 2014 , compared with a rise of 1 per cent between the same two months in 2013			0
almost all of the downward contribution came from the falling price of petrol and diesel , the @entity23 said			2
@entity165 falls in food and transport costs were the biggest drivers in the fall in inflation to 0.5 per cent , the @entity23 said latest figures show that wages were up 1.6 per cent in october , well ahead of falling inflation the average price per litre fell to 116.8p for petrol and 122.9p for diesel , some 24.8p per litre below the peak average prices of in april 2012			1
since december , fuel prices have fallen even further , with petrol now selling for under Â£ 1 per litre in sum areas			0
@entity181 , chief economist at the @entity182 , said : ' this is good news for the vast majority of businesses and households in the @entity82			2
' neither the @entity187 nor the @entity76 will be worried by today 's figures			0
in the @entity82 , lower prices driven by a fall in the cost of oil will provide a boost to the economy , and underpin domestic confidence and spending			0

@entity24 drops to 0.5 *%* , the lowest level since may 2000
supermarket price war and falling petrol prices *trigger* drop in cost of living
with wages rising , family incomes should go further each month
@entity136 @entity208 says low inflation acts as a ' giant tax cut '
@entity67 hails the ' good news ' *benefiting* hard - working *taxpayers*
