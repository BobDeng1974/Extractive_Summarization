last month the @entity6 ruled that although the majority of his time in jail or in an immigration removal centre was ' lawful ' , his first five days in jail were ' unlawful ' as he had not been ' served a notice of detention ' within the correct time period			1
@entity68 , sitting as deputy high court judge , noted @entity7 's ' appalling criminal record ' , but stated : ' the first five days were unlawful in that no notice ( of detention ) had been served - substantial damages of £ 500 are awarded			1
' the ruling was revealed today			0
the court also ruled the following seven weeks in jail were ' unlawful ' and awarded a further £ 100 of ' nominal damages '			2
according to court documents , @entity7 was sent to @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , and in august 2008 a detention review on his case stated : ' mr @entity7 has shown a propensity to re-offend and as such can be considered a harm to the public good			2

during his time on detention @entity7 put in an appeal to the @entity104 , saying he was being unlawfully detained			2
@entity105 , a director at the @entity59 , wrote in 2010 that @entity7 had ' multiple identities ' and if released was at risk of ' absconding ' and committing more crimes			0
@entity7 was told that his appeal to the @entity104 was not a ' high priority ' for the court and was told there was a ' backlog of 30 years ' for cases			0
in july 2010 , a case worker stated : ' he informed me he would rather stay in detention or prison that go home			0
' he told the case worker @entity8 was a ' foreign country to him ' and that he would rather go to @entity122 , where he claimed to have an uncle			0

he also claimed to be from the @entity130 , saying he had relatives there			0
he was due to be flown out of the @entity3 on august 28 2011 , but did n't get on the flight because of red tape over his identity - with the same thing happening again on september 28 2011			2

he was finally put on a flight to @entity8 on february 28 2013 - 22 years after arriving in the @entity3 - after telling the authorities ' he was prepared to move to any country in order to be released from detention '			1
a source , who works in immigration and speaking on condition on anonymity , said today : ' day in , day out we deal with cases like this where we have to jump through hoops and bow down to legal loopholes which prevent us from deporting people			0
' it 's got to the stage where we are banging our heads against a brick wall and in the end this guy gets a £ 600 payout from the @entity3 taxpayer			2
it would be funny if it was n't so ridiculous			0
' he added : ' the time he has spent in prison and detention centres will have cost upwards of £ 250,000			0
' i dare not think how much the court cases , legal challenges , cancelled chartered flights and all the paperwork have cost in the past 20 - odd years , but it 's safe to say it will be substantially more than £ 1m			0
