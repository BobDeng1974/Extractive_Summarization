he has faced accusations of chillaxing ever since he was appointed – not least because of his tendency to fall asleep on the job			2
but it seems @entity6 the @entity8 cat is at last taking his duties as @entity10 to the @entity11 seriously			2
after a barren year he leapt into action yesterday , and was found sitting proudly alongside a dead mouse outside no 10			1
bring out the bunting : @entity6 is shown here outside no. 10 and to the far left you can see his victim lying on the small lawn first kill : a year after arriving at @entity19 is shown on the left just after pouncing on a mouse , which was then tossed on the grass , right , just outside the prime minister 's official residence it was believed to be his first ‘ confirmed kill ’ , with the prey itself as evidence			1
@entity6 , five , was recruited last february to rid no 10 of its rodent problem , but swiftly earned a reputation for napping rather than ratting			1
until yesterday , when it appears he discovered his killer instinct			2
@entity34 , deputy director of communications at @entity35 , tweeted : ‘ @entity36 arrived at work			1
@entity6 the cat sitting proudly outside no 10 front door with a dead mouse next to him			1
’ she added : ‘ contrary to popular belief @entity6 is not a tart for the cameras and moved			0
’ while the other residents of @entity45 still have weeks until the end of the summer recess , perhaps @entity6 has tired of the easy life			0
in june , he was photographed soaking up the sunshine in the middle of @entity8			0
but he soon found himself hoisted up by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by no 11 , where @entity52 and @entity53 live			0
@entity6 , a rescue cat from @entity56 , was hailed as a ‘ good ratter ’ and having ‘ a high chase - drive and hunting instinct ’ when he first arrived in @entity8			2
but his career has , until now , been less than successful			0
indeed , last year a photographer caught him as he pounced for a mouse – and missed			1
and he previously got into trouble by lingering outside the famous front door before the prime minister was due for a photo call , earning himself a gentle nudge inside courtesy of a policeman ’s boot			0
at least yesterday ’s kill will make up for the disappointment he naturally felt after narrowly missing out on celebrity @entity73			0
he was beaten to the top prize by cartoon character @entity76			0
long boot of the law : @entity6 paused too long for the policeman standing guard last year , who helped him on his way with a helpful boot up the backside taking it easy : @entity6 the @entity8 had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now job done : @entity6 has earned his keep while @entity90 is on holiday in @entity92 , shown here stalking the corridors of power behind you ! last year @entity6 the @entity8 cat prepared to pounce as this mouse popped its head up - but he missed now where is it ? @entity6 searched the gulley as the mouse ducks out of sight - but thankfully he has caught his first one			1
