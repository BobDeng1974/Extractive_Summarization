@entity0 who guarded @entity3 's chemical weapons compound in @entity4 were particularly fearful of one bunker they dubbed the ' dragon 's egg '			1
@entity9 soldiers posted to the @entity10 were never allowed to look inside the vast three - square - mile site , where up to 4,000 tonnes of deadly @entity12 was produced each year			1
but former guard @entity13 revealed to @entity15 's @entity14 there was an ominous feeling surrounding one @entity19 bunker - which is now in the hands of @entity22 fighters			1
a @entity24 picture of the @entity10 , which produced chemical weapons on an industrial scale remnants of @entity4 's chemical weapons program at the @entity10			1
it was destroyed by @entity9 bombs during the 1991 @entity31 ' we were made aware of a particular bunker on the north side [ of @entity38 ] which we were informed was sealed and remotely monitored , ' @entity13 , who served in the weapons company of the @entity33 , @entity34 , told @entity15			1
' we were not to approach , and definitely not to attempt to enter			0
' despite conflicting claims about the nature of weaponry held at the ' dragon 's egg ' , @entity13 insists he has no doubt it produced liquid nerve agents after his platoon was ordered to clean the area surrounding it			1
he told @entity14 : ' when we began searching , we discovered a huge stockpile of 105 - millimeter artillery shells that were filled with mustard gas			2
' i have always wondered why it never became big news , as well as other incidents			0
i never doubted the existence of chemical and biological weapons in @entity4			2
' one @entity0 , he said , ' picked [ a shell ] up and could literally hear the liquid sloshing around inside of it			0
' the enter site was bombed by the @entity9 during the @entity31 , but the munitions there were only partially destroyed , according to the @entity65 - then left to @entity4 to take care of			1
however , @entity4 officials wrote to the @entity65 this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing @entity12 are still in the ruins of the @entity10 , which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s			1
this is now in the hands of the violent jihadists			0
they warned that they had watched equipment there being looted on @entity78			0
@entity79 : @entity80 controls a compound in @entity4 containing 2,500 chemical weapons rockets , according to the @entity4 government			1
pictured are @entity85 technicians preparing unexploded ordnance for demolition at a safe disposal area near @entity89 in 2003 a @entity91 soldier loads materials discovered in an explosives laboratory hidden in a home april 15 , 2003 in @entity89 , @entity4 militants then shut the surveillance cameras at the depot down , the @entity95 reported			1
@entity4 's @entity65 ambassador @entity99 wrote to the @entity65 saying that ' armed terrorist groups ' took over the @entity38 complex , which lies 60 miles north of @entity89 , on june 11			1
in a letter to @entity65 @entity104 ban ki - moon , ambassador @entity99 said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there			1
' the project management spotted at dawn on thursday , 12 june 2014 , through the camera surveillance system , the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances , before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system , ' @entity99 wrote in the letter dated june 30			0
' @entity118 requests the @entity119 to understand the current inability of @entity4 , owing to the deterioration of the security situation , to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons , ' he said			1
the @entity38 complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year			0
@entity99 singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) northwest of @entity89 in the notorious ' @entity128			2
' the last major report by @entity65 inspectors on the status of @entity4 's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in march 2003			1
it states that @entity135 contained 2,500 sarin - filled 122 - mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991 , and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide , ' a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun			0
' however , @entity9 @entity142 spokesman rear admiral @entity141 said earlier that the @entity9 ' best understanding was that ' whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now '			0
' we are n't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point , ' @entity141 said			0
' should they even be able to access the materials , frankly , it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else			0
' it was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in @entity4 following the 2003 invasion but the @entity161 chose to keep the findings top secret			1
an investigation by @entity95 has revealed that @entity9 forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads , shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011			2
secrets : in 2002 president @entity171 said @entity3 was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found but the information was n't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were @entity9 - made , plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore did n't support president @entity171 's rationale for going to war			1
the weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155 - millimeter artillery shells or 122 - millimeter rockets - were developed by @entity3 during the @entity182 which raged between 1980 and 1988			2
but on september 12 , 2002 , president @entity171 had contended that @entity3 was developing new chemical weapons capable of ' mass destruction '			2
' right now , @entity4 is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons , ' he said			2
but all the weapons found had been developed before 1991			0
in march 2003 , president @entity171 received a mandate from the @entity195 to lead an invasion of @entity4 , asserting that @entity4 was in violation of @entity198			0
with strong support from @entity202 p.m. @entity201 , the @entity171 administration claimed that @entity3 and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to @entity9 security and that of allies including the @entity202 and @entity210			2
after investigation following the invasion , the @entity9 led @entity213 concluded that @entity4 had ended its nuclear , chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion , but that they intended to resume production if the @entity4 sanctions were lifted			1
although no active chemical weapons program was found , at least 17 @entity9 troops and 7 @entity4 police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded			1
president @entity171 later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was ' the intelligence failure ' in @entity4 , while the @entity229 found in 2008 that his administration ' misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from @entity4 '			2
the @entity9 completed its withdrawal of military personnel in december 2011 , during the ninth year of the war			0
the rise of @entity80 means that the @entity9 will send an army headquarters to @entity4 for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group			1
another reason for the cover - up , according to @entity242 , was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the @entity9 '' ' nothing of significance '' is what i was ordered to say , ' said @entity251 , a now - retired @entity253 major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war			1
soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load			2
chemical warfare specialists had to be called in , and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions			0
' i could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear , or i could just make it disappear myself , ' one ex-soldier told @entity242			0
@entity9 secretary of state @entity271 ( centre ) is greeted as he arrives at @entity273			0
he 's in the country to discuss @entity276 's nuclear program the mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated			0
however , handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries , which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time			2
many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals , believing them to be regular old artillery			0
at least 17 @entity9 military personnel and seven @entity4 police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases			1
many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation , exposing the soldiers to the potentially - lethal fumes			0
symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge , seething blisters			0
@entity304 , a former @entity253 sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company , joked of ' wounds that never happened ' from ' that stuff that did n't exist '			0
' i love it when i hear , '' oh there were n't any chemical weapons in @entity4 '' , ' he said			1

@entity13 describes ominous *atmosphere* of ' dragon 's egg ' bunker
@entity0 was not allowed to look in , once found mustard gas by the entrance
@entity80 controls a former chemical weapons factory near @entity89 , it 's claimed
the @entity10 made nerve agents in the 80s and 90s
@entity4 wrote to the @entity65 this summer to say that it had lost control of the depot
officials said that armed terrorist groups had taken over the complex
it comes after it was revealed the @entity9 found 5,000 chemical weapons in @entity4
