by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 21 march 2013 examined : convicted arsonist @entity1 was executed in 2004 for the murder of his three children			1
the evidence from the fire at his home is being re-examined evidence used to convict a man who was executed nine years ago for killing his three children in a fire - is to be re-examined			1
@entity1 was put to death in 2004 after being found guilty of deliberately setting fire to his family 's home in @entity16 , @entity17 in 1991			1
but the evidence used to convict him is now to be reassessed by the state 's fire marshal and the ' @entity22 ' of @entity17 as part of a wider review of dozens of past convictions for arson			1
authorities in @entity17 and in other states are beginning to re-examine cases in which defendants were sent to prison for setting fires based on expert testimony about burn patterns and charring that today is considered suspect			1
the @entity22 , a national legal reform group that has worked to exonerate more than 250 convicts , has identified potentially problematic arson cases in several states , including one in @entity40 , @entity41 , in 1970 in which 29 people were killed			1
in @entity17 , which has had to free more than 100 inmates wrongly convicted in criminal cases , the state @entity22 has narrowed its working list to about 60 arson cases of the 1,000 reviewed , chief counsel @entity44 said			1
a state expert panel , the @entity50 , has also made 17 recommendations for improving how arson cases are handled			1
the widespread attention given the @entity1 case has driven interest in looking at other arson - related convictions			1
@entity1 was convicted of killing his children after deliberately starting a fire the family 's home in @entity16 , @entity17 on december 23 , 1991			1
he was executed in 2004			2
the @entity50 investigated the case for years , but was barred by attorney general @entity63 from issuing a final report			2
arson experts hired by the commission found the 1991 fire was most likely accidental			2
it is possible that problems will be found with more cases , @entity69 @entity68 said			2
execution : the @entity74 , @entity17 , where @entity1 was executed ' having been around fire investigations and being in the fire service the last 35 years , i saw where there could be improvements , ' he added			1
' i wanted to try to lead that effort to improving fire investigations			0
it should be based on science			0
' if the group finds problems with an arson investigation , its findings will be sent to the authorities with jurisdiction over the case and to the @entity93 , @entity68 said			2
no action will be required , but the report could help someone who is wrongly imprisoned convicted : @entity97 is one of a number of men convicted of arson whose cases are now being re-examined by the authorities another case to be reviewed is that of @entity97 - who was given life in prison 25 years ago for killing his two stepsons by locking them in a backyard shed and setting it on fire			1
two investigators used photos of the shed 's remains to persuade jurors that @entity114 had started the fire intentionally			0
but by today 's standards of fire analysis - the investigators may have been mistaken			0
representatives will meet next month to start reviewing the first six cases , including @entity114 's , who was convicted in 1988 of setting the deadly fire in the central @entity17 town of @entity124			1
@entity114 is now a white - haired , 60 - year - old man , who in a recent prison interview continued to maintain his innocence			2
' i know that there will be people that will never change their mind , and of course , there will be people that will , ' @entity114 said			0
' it 's difficult for me to believe they ca n't believe the science			0
the science , it 's pretty accurate now			0
' @entity114 's then - wife , @entity142 , said she remains convinced he is guilty			0
ms @entity142 said she remembers graf acting suspiciously before and after the blaze			0
of the new questions about the arson investigation , she said , ' he got lucky			2
this might be his get - out - of - jail - free card			0
' a final decision on a new trial is pending before the @entity93			0
mr @entity68 would not take a position on @entity114 's innocence but wants to address any problems with old cases			0
' i really wo n't know , personally , until we get into this , ' he said			0
and that first opportunity will be in april			0

@entity1 was executed in @entity17 nine years ago
case is one of a number being reviewed following advances in *forensics*
' @entity22 ' is working to review 60 arson cases in @entity17 alone
