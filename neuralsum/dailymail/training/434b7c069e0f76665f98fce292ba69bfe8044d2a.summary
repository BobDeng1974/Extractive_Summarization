by @entity1 reporter published : 20:12 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 05:57 est , 30 october 2013 a second mystery barge has been discovered - this one docked in @entity3 , thousands of miles away from the ship spotted in @entity5 that has set the tech world abuzz			2
the vessel in @entity8 looks nearly identical to its cousin 2,700 miles away in @entity11 - four stories of shipping containers welded together atop a large flat barge			2
they are also both registered to the same mysterious @entity16 - based corporation			0
the ships are widely believed to be owned by @entity18 - built as prototype floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers			1
mystery : this is the @entity3 barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by @entity18 this is the @entity5 barge - which looks strikingly similar to the mysterious ship docked in @entity8 @entity18 has refused to comment on the vessels , though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally - friendly sea - powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent			1
the @entity41 reports the @entity3 barge is docked at the city 's @entity43 's @entity42			0
contractors from local engineering firm @entity46 are installing high - tech equipment in the vessel , though workers said even they did n't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for			0
@entity54 is known about them , but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor			0
the structures are registered with a @entity16 corporation as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
in binary code used in computing , the numbers spell out " one , " " two , " " three " and " four			0
" currently , nos. 1 and 2 are on the water in @entity71 and no. 3 is in @entity8			0
also , the @entity16 company to which they 're registered is called @entity76 and large , a likely joking reference to " @entity76 , " the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 @entity80 film ' @entity77 ' the @entity71 barge is docked at @entity82 in the @entity83 is this is ? a 2009 patent filed by @entity18 shows a water - borne data center possible : this large structure on a barge just off @entity82 , between @entity71 and @entity89 , could be a floating data center being made by @entity18 @entity18 's patent describes ' a system includes a floating platform - mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units , a sea - based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units , and one or more sea - water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units			1
' ' the cutouts in the long walls of the containers , when they line up , they make hallways , ' said @entity110 , who designs similar structures			0
' you could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers ... it does n't have enough windows for an office building ' now , @entity120 investigative reporter @entity119 claims the mystery construction site floating in @entity83 could belong to @entity18 , drawing on evidence from lease agreements , expert consultations and interviews with locals			1
he said putting data centers inside shipping containers , as he claims @entity18 is doing , is already a well - established practice			1
while some commentators have criticized the reporter 's evidence as circumstantial , experts say it 's plausible that @entity18 would build water - based data facility			1
@entity110 , the principal at @entity137 , which designs custom cargo container buildings , said the structure looks like a data center			1
' the cutouts in the long walls of the containers , when they line up , they make hallways , ' @entity110 told @entity120			0
' you could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers ... it does n't have enough windows for an office building			2
' @entity110 said that putting a data center on a barge would provide access to abundant water to help cool a large number of servers			1
@entity157 , a @entity158 research fellow and expert on data centers , said companies such as @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , and @entity165 have been installing specially built data centers in shipping containers for some time because they 're easy to deploy			0
this is an aerial view of the ' secret project ' in @entity83 this is @entity171 3 on @entity82 , alongside @entity172 , as seen in @entity173 , before construction began plans ? sources say @entity18 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity82 across the @entity5 to @entity71 ¿ s @entity178 , where it would be anchored and open to the public meanwhile , @entity181 5 reports that @entity18 is actually building a floating marketing center at @entity171 for @entity183 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under development			1
@entity181 5 claims sources say @entity18 hopes to tow the completed structure from @entity82 across the @entity5 to @entity71 ’s @entity178 , where it would be anchored and open to the public			2
the media outlet also reported that construction on the site , near the @entity191 , stopped several weeks ago because @entity18 does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront			2
construction on the site commenced last year , and the work is being shielded by a high security fence			0
another theory is that @entity18 is building a floating marketing center at for @entity183 , the cutting - edge wearable computer the company has under			1

experts speculate that @entity18 is building a floating data center on a barge in @entity83
@entity18 patented the idea in 2009 , but has n't commented on the development
others theorize the internet company is building a floating marketing center for @entity183
