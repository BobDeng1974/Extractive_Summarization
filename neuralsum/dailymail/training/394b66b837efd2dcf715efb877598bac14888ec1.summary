a study by scientists at @entity2 in @entity3 found the hpv vaccine has no impact on sexual behaviour in young girls fears the hpv vaccine promotes sexual promiscuity in young girls are unfounded , scientists say			1
a study in @entity3 has found the human papilloma virus ( @entity14 ) vaccine has had little impact on the sexual behaviour of teenage girls			1
@entity14 is a common sexually transmitted infection			0
although in many cases the virus goes away by itself , and may cause no symptoms , it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer			0
there are more than 100 types of hpv infection , with around 40 affecting the genital area			2
both men and women can carry the virus , but smoking , having multiple sexual partners and losing your virginity at an early age are all risk factors			2
most women will have an hpv infection at some point in their lives , usually without knowing it			2
but others types of @entity14 are known to increase the risk of developing cancer , particularly cervical cancer			0
since 2006 , the hpv vaccine has been licensed in almost 100 countries , including @entity3			1
in the @entity50 the vaccine was introduced in 2008			2
many of these countries have national hpv vaccination programmes to protect young girls against the virus before they become sexually active			1
however there are concerns the vaccine - which guards against four types of the virus shown to cause cervical cancer - may give girls a false sense of security about their risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections			1
that false sense of security could , some experts argue , lead young girls to engage in riskier sexual activity			1
but researchers at @entity2 in @entity71 claim they have disproved the theory			0
dr @entity73 , lead author of the study , said : ' these findings suggest fears of increased risky sexual behaviour following hpv vaccination are unwarranted and should not be a barrier to vaccinating at a young age			1
' her team analysed 260,000 girls , of whom around half were eligible for @entity71 's publicly funded , school - based hpv vaccination programme during the first two school years it was offered ( 2007/08 and 2008/09 )			2
the researchers followed the girls until march 31 of their grade 12 year			0
around six per cent of girls became pregnant or contracted an sti between grades 10 and 12			0
this equates to 10,187 pregnancies and 6,259 cases of @entity99 - related sexually transmitted infections			0
dr @entity100 , senior author , said : ' neither hpv vaccination nor programme eligibility increased the risk of pregnancy nor @entity99 - related @entity105 among females aged 14 to 17 years			1
' the results of the study can be used by physicians , public health providers and policy makers to address public and parental concerns about hpv vaccination and promiscuity			1
' the study was published in the @entity116			0
the human papilloma virus is known to cause cervical cancer , pictured			0
the vaccine was introduced in almost 100 countries across the world in 2006			0
