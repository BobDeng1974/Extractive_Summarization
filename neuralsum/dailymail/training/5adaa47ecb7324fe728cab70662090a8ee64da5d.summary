@entity0 could be found the other night sitting on the floor outside the men ’s locker room waiting for her player to emerge after his @entity6 fourth - round win			1
of all the uncertainties and backstage undercurrents surrounding @entity11 ’s semi-final against @entity12 on thursday morning , one thing is for sure : his coach will not gain access to the inner sanctum to offer advice			1
while @entity19 ’s presence in @entity12 ’s box gives this encounter a fascinating dynamic , it should not be overlooked how important the match is for @entity0 — still in some senses the outsider			1
@entity11 and @entity0 have a chat during their practice session on wednesday @entity11 celebrates after setting up a last four clash with in - form @entity12 in @entity31 a win for @entity11 and a return to a @entity35 final will silence many doubters , who question whether he made the right decision to hire her as @entity40 ’s long - term replacement			1
defeat , though , will leave the @entity0 appointment open to debate , and it will be all the more galling to have had the long - term ally he split with sitting in the opposition box			2
@entity11 is aware of all this and has become protective of his coach , going out of his way to sing her praises after a run when he has looked much more his old self			1
@entity11 works on his serve under the watchful eye of his coach @entity0 he is also persisting — to the puzzlement of @entity54 — with his line that everyone in his slimmed - down team is now working together			1
‘ when everyone is pulling in the same direction , then things are going to improve , ’ he said			2
‘ i feel like i made some big improvements to my game and physically in the off - season , and i think that has showed so far in this event			2
‘ i enjoy working with @entity0			2
she gets on very well with my team , too			0
she has a good personality to coach and a lot of experience , so i ’m happy with the way it ’s working			0
i ’ve got some things to look forward to later in the year with @entity73 ( his fiancee ) , and when you ’re content with things and happy in the people you ’re surrounding yourself with , that ’s a positive			0
’ @entity11 training on the @entity79 ahead of his match with @entity12 on thursday morning @entity11 is set to come up against his long - term friend @entity19 , who now coaches @entity12 he felt the need for change late last season , especially after the drubbing he took at the @entity86 at the hands of @entity88			1
‘ clearly the way things ended at the @entity91 was n’t the best way to end it			0
maybe there were some reasons for that			0
i think things right now are much smoother and calmer , and everyone ’s a lot less stressed than was the case at the end of last year			0
’ it must be said that his excellent results , bar @entity88 , in the @entity103 period do not talk of a team held back by disharmony			0
there is the sense that @entity11 is using his loyalty to his coach , and the conflict - by - proxy with his old friend @entity19 , as motivational fodder			1
while @entity0 was keeping her counsel , @entity19 talked publicly on wednesday in a way that he was never allowed to do when working with the 27 - year - old @entity117			1
the @entity118 is now his own man , but still knows better than to wind up @entity11			1
the @entity117 was in fine form to defeat @entity123 hope @entity121 in straight sets in the quarter - finals ‘ last year he might not have been as fit , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ he went through back surgery			0
it ’s normal that it takes time to get back to where you were before			0
‘ i do n’t see it as any different to where he was two or three years ago			0
i think he ’s at the same level when he was winning @entity136 and i ’m happy for him			0
’ he does not recognise the issue @entity11 raised about not pulling together , and added : ‘ to be honest , i do n’t know what he means , at least from my side			1
’ what he and @entity142 do agree on is that @entity145 ’s inside knowledge is not going to be the defining factor in this semi-final			0
‘ i do n’t think so , ’ said @entity19			2
‘ they know each other ’s games very well			0
i do n’t think i am the advantage			0
@entity11 and @entity152 are the ones playing against each other			2
if at the start of the tournament you ’d asked @entity152 or @entity11 if they ’d like to be in this situation , they would have said yes			2
’ the other semi-final sees a re-match of last year ’s classic quarter - final between @entity162 and world no 1 @entity164			1
on that occasion @entity162 won 9 - 7 in the fifth and went on to claim the title .			1
