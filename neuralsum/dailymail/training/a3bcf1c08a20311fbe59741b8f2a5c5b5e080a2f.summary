by @entity0 the best steak restaurants pride themselves on their ovens			2
they are far hotter that the average home setup - but for one @entity5 chef they still were n't enough			2
@entity7 travelled to @entity8 in @entity9 to attempt to cook using @entity10 created by an ' artificial volcano '			1
to create lava , they start with @entity22 and use the furnace , described as ' like a crock pot ' to melt it			1
it takes about 60 hours to melt and degas approx. 800lbs of lava , which creates a flow lasting 7 - 9 minutes			0
the team has done 100 lava pours so far , for artistic and scientific purposes , but had never actually used the lava ’s @entity33 heat to cook before			1
' i 've always been obsessed with volcanoes , and had a dream of being able to cook with lava , ' he told @entity39			0
' we wanted to find a way to cook with it , and heard about professor @entity16 , who has spent five years working to perfect a technique to make lava in this furnace			0
' @entity7 got in touch with @entity16 at @entity8 in @entity9 , and he instantly agreed to help them			1
the researchers created an artificial flow of @entity10 for the team to cook on			1
the ultimate barbecue ? @entity7 grills steak on the lava flow created from an artificial volcano the finished steak and corn , which @entity7 described as the best he 'd ever eaten although it was the first time steak has been cooked on lava , the results mean that the chef hopes it wo n't be the last - and says cooking over lava could be the ultimate way to prepare steak			1
' when you cook on a barbecue you get a ot of smoke			0
' because lava is pure heat , you get meat sealed v quickly , and with a very even char			2
' the team even developed a special technique , sealing the meat with an initial blast of lave , letting it rest , then finishing it off			0
a grill was clamped over the lava flow to allow the chef easy access the @entity83 molten lava , which is created on site and then poured to recreate a lava flow ' it was awesome - and totally delivers , in fact it was the best steak i 've ever had in my life , ' said @entity7			1
the firm now hope to develop the technique for an event			0
' we are hoping we can scale the lava flow and do this elsewhere , we have big plans			0
' we want to create a lava banquet for 500 people - you can combine education , thrill and have an experience you 'll want to tell everyone about			2
' @entity16 and his team at @entity8 said ' after looking into them , i realized they were very serious , fun / insane and had pulled off some really ambitious projects			1
' i found their commitment to their work to be as serious as i am to mine ; i think they are operating in a new area of fine art installation involving entertainment , food , science , etc. all of which translates to an incredibly deep curiosity on their part			0
' after the opening of their @entity127 installation in june they came up to @entity8			2
' after they saw their first but short pour of lava for a @entity130 grant proof of concept ; they went with my assistant to the grocery store and i went to the ice place ; the result is what you see in the video '			0
ready to cook : @entity7 wore special protective clothing die the the heat and his proximity to the lava the lava is full @entity7 's firm , @entity7 and @entity143 , have previously created several major food installations , ranging from jelly moulds in the shape of buildings to gin and tonic ' clouds ;			1
they also worked to allow @entity152 to ' taste ' @entity154 eve fireworks			0
this year , the skyline will not only be filled with exploding colours , but peach snow , banana confetti and giant ' zesty orange ' bubbles			0
jelly geniuses @entity7 , who famously put a cake - inspired crazy golf course on the roof of @entity166 , have created special effects involving fruit flavours and fruit smells , to go along with the fireworks .			1

@entity8 *lab* created lava that reached heat of @entity15
chef @entity7 said steak was the best he had ever eaten *due* to the lack of smoke and high temperatures
team hope to create a ' lava volcano '
