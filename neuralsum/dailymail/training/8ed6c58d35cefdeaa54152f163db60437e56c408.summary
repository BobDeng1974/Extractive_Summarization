by @entity0 , @entity1 scientists and art experts have found a hidden painting beneath one of @entity7 's first masterpieces , @entity8 , using advances in infrared imagery to reveal a bow - tied man with his face resting on his hand			1
now the question that conservators at the @entity16 in @entity17 hope to answer is simply : who is he ? it 's a mystery that 's fuelling new research about the 1901 painting created early in @entity7 's career while he was working in @entity24 at the start of his distinctive blue period of melancholy subjects			1
what lies beneath : the @entity29 , one of @entity7 's first masterpieces , under a microscope at the @entity16 , @entity17			1
scientists and art experts have found a hidden painting beneath the painting curators and conservators revealed their findings for the first time to @entity1 last week			2
over the past five years , experts from the @entity16 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity43 's @entity42 have developed a clearer image of the mystery picture under the surface			2

' it 's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special , ' said @entity56 , the conservator at the @entity16 who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man 's face			0
' the second reaction was , " well , who is it ? " we 're still working on answering that question			0
' who is he ? @entity56 , associate conservator at the @entity16 , points to the image found beneath @entity8 , a bow - tied man with his face resting on his hand , with three rings on his fingers the @entity29 beneath the microscope : conservators long suspected there might be something under the surface of @entity8 , which has been part of the @entity16 in @entity17 since 1927 in 2008 , improved infrared imagery revealed for the first time a man 's bearded face resting on his hand with three rings on his fingers			1
he 's dressed in a jacket and bow tie			0
a technical analysis confirmed the hidden portrait is a work @entity7 likely painted just before @entity8 , curators said			1

conservators long suspected there might be something under the surface of @entity8 , which has been part of the @entity16 in @entity17 since 1927			0
brushstrokes on the piece clearly do n't match the composition that depicts a woman bathing in @entity7 's studio			1
a conservator noted the odd brushstrokes in a 1954 letter , but it was n't until the 1990s that an x-ray of the painting first revealed a fuzzy image of something under the picture			0
it was n't clear , though , that it was a portrait			0
' it 's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special ' : @entity56 , the associate conservator who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man 's face , shows it on computer ' when he had an idea , you know , he just had to get it down and realise it ' : curator @entity122 told the @entity1 that @entity7 could not afford to buy new canvasses every time he had an idea he wanted to pursue the @entity29 in a vertical orientation in front of an infared camera : suspicions were raised by brushstrokes on the piece which clearly do n't match the composition that depicts a woman bathing in @entity7 's studio ms @entity56 sets up an infared camera to view the image beneath the @entity29 : after the portrait was discovered , conservators have been using other technology to scan the painting for further insights ' when he had an idea , you know , he just had to get it down and realise it , ' curator @entity122 told the @entity1 , revealing @entity7 had hurriedly painted over another complete picture			1
' he could not afford to acquire new canvasses every time he had an idea that he wanted to pursue			0
he worked sometimes on cardboard because canvas was so much more expensive			0
' scholars are researching who this man might be and why @entity7 painted him			2
they have ruled out the possibility that it was a self - portrait			0
one possible figure is the @entity24 art dealer @entity156 who hosted @entity7 's first show in 1901			1
but there 's no documentation and no clues left on the canvas , so the research continues			0

it will also examine the revelation of the man 's portrait beneath the painting @entity56 has been collaborating with other experts to scan the painting with multi-spectral imaging technology and x-ray fluorescence intensity mapping to try to identify and map the colors of the hidden painting			2
they would like to recreate a digital image approximating the colors @entity7 used			2
