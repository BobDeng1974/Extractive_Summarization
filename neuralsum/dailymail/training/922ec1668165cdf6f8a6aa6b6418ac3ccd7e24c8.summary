a stunning photograph captures the moment a striped marlin spotted its lunch and went straight for the kill - spearing a helpless sardine with its huge , needle - like snout			1
swimming in the waters off @entity9 's @entity8 , the carnivorous fish attacked a large shoal , forcing them to scatter and leaving a handful of weaker sardines isolated and vulnerable			1
it was then able to swoop again , using its spear - like snout to puncture a hole in the side of a prone sardine at a speed of 50mph , before using its small , file - like teeth to finish off the dying fish			1
the incredible underwater photographs were taken by @entity26 wildlife photographer @entity25 , who was free diving off the @entity9 coast when he spotted the striped marlin hunting			1
describing the experience he said : ' the striped marlins have broken these sardines off from a giant shoal deep below , and forced them upwards to trap them against the surface of the water			0
' ' then they break the school apart , charging through it and first picking off the weakest fish or the ones that get confused and do n't move with the rest of the bait , ' he added			0
' the striped marlins sometimes strike the fish with their bills , using a slashing motion , to injure them before swallowing them			0
other times they just swallow them directly , ' mr @entity25 went on to say			2
'' they rarely impale a sardine on their bill , however i was lucky enough to capture this , ' he added			0
striped : the incredible underwater photographs were taken by @entity26 wildlife photographer @entity25 , who was free diving off the @entity9 coast when he spotted the marlin hunting in the deep : @entity25 was free diving five metres below the water when he saw the marlin reach speeds of up to 50mph , charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter striped marlins are rarely seen , and very rarely photographed underwater in their natural habitat			1
however , free diving five metres below the water , mr @entity25 was able to watch as the fish reached speeds of up to 50mph , charging the sardine shoal and forcing them to scatter			1
with most photographs taken at a distance of around three metres from the fish , he was lucky enough to touch the marlins at times			0
' most people ask how it was possible for me to capture these photographs ... some ask if they are paintings , or were created with computer wizardry , ' mr @entity25 said			2
' i wanted to show the beauty of these magnificent apex predators to the 99.999 per cent of people who will never themselves see a free - swimming marlin underwater , ' he added			0
not common : striped marlins are rarely seen , and hardly ever photographed underwater in the wild danger : photographing powerful predators up close is a potentially dangerous activity and mr @entity25 is keen to point out that he does n't want to give the impression that he considers his hobby safe lucky man : @entity25 , 62 , lives in @entity49 , @entity50 and is one of very few people to have taken a photograph of a striped marlin hunting sardines in its natural environment photographing large , powerful predators at close range in the open ocean is a potentially dangerous activity and mr @entity25 is keen to point out that he does n't want to give the impression that he considers his hobby safe , or is encouraging aspiring wildlife photographers to copy him			1
' @entity128 are being over-harvested in much of the world 's oceans , and most people do n't pay much attention because this happens so far out of sight of land , ' he said			0
' however , apex predators exert a controlling influence on the food web beneath them , and their removal can reverberate throughout the ocean 's ecosystem , ' he added			0
