@entity1 - born @entity0 has been named in the @entity2 squad for this season 's @entity3			1
the @entity6 fly - half , 23 , moved to @entity2 earlier this season and has made just nine appearances for his regional side			1
@entity0 , whose mother was born in @entity2 , is among four uncapped players in a 34 - man group announced by head coach @entity13			1
@entity0 ( left ) , pictured in action for @entity6 , has been called up to the @entity2 squad @entity2 head coach @entity13 has named his 34 - man squad for the @entity3 backs : @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity36 ( @entity26 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , a @entity39 ( @entity6 ) , @entity40 ( @entity32 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity26 ) , @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , @entity22 ( @entity18 ) , @entity23 ( @entity6 ) , @entity24 ( @entity6 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , @entity29 ( @entity26 ) , @entity30 ( @entity28 ) , @entity19 ( @entity18 )			1
forwards : @entity57 ( @entity6 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60 ( @entity26 ) , a @entity61 ( @entity28 ) , @entity62 ( @entity26 ) , @entity42 ( @entity6 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , @entity45 ( @entity28 ) , @entity46 ( @entity6 ) , @entity47 ( @entity28 ) , @entity48 ( @entity26 ) , @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 ( @entity18 ) , @entity52 ( @entity28 ) , @entity53 ( @entity28 ) , @entity54 ( @entity6 , capt ) , @entity55 ( @entity28 ) , @entity56 ( @entity32 )			0
@entity0 will be joined by fellow test rookies in @entity32 centre @entity64 , @entity26 prop @entity66 and @entity6 hooker @entity67			1
there are no places , though , for 95 times - capped @entity6 prop @entity70 or @entity44 fly - half @entity72			2
@entity72 's omission is not a surprise - he was left out of @entity13 's autumn test squad earlier this season - yet 33 - year - old @entity70 had been tipped for a recall after @entity26 forward @entity77 suffered a shoulder injury			1
but @entity13 has chosen @entity79 , @entity61 and @entity80 as his three tighthead props , raising fresh question marks over @entity77 ' international future			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , offers @entity13 options at fly - half and full - back , although it remains to be see whether he features in the match - day 23 for @entity2 ' @entity3 opener against @entity90 in @entity91 on february 6			2
elsewhere in the squad there is a recall for fit - again @entity26 scrum - half @entity95 , who joins fellow number nines @entity98 and @entity99 , with @entity31 featuring among the centres			0
@entity31 , who is among seven players to have signed a national dual contract in @entity2 , has also been named in the @entity2 under - 20 squad for their @entity3 campaign , and he will be released from the senior camp to link up with the age group side			2
prop @entity70 has been left out of the @entity2 squad despite winning 95 caps for his country @entity113 fly - half @entity111 ( right ) has also missed out on a place in @entity13 's squad @entity13 said : ' it 's great to be able to name such an experienced squad that also boasts some exciting young talent			1
' the four uncapped players have all been going well for their respective regions , and it will be good to see them in this environment and we hope they take the opportunity			0
' they come into a squad packed with experience , and that experience will be important to us over the next eight weeks and the year as a whole			0
@entity32 centre @entity64 is another of the uncapped players in line to make his debut ' we all know how tough the @entity3 is , and we kick the tournament off with a huge game against @entity90 , and that is something you have to be excited about and look forward to			0
' we were pleased on the whole with the autumn campaign , and this is another opportunity for us as we look ahead to a very big year in the rugby calendar			0
' @entity2 will also face @entity90 in their @entity143 pool later this year , while their @entity3 campaign features away games against @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 , plus a @entity150 appointment with @entity151 .			0

@entity1 - born @entity0 moved to @entity2 earlier this season
test rookies @entity64 , @entity66 and @entity67 also *included*
@entity70 and @entity72 both miss out on place in @entity2 squad
