@entity5 had the chance to cancel out @entity10 's first - half opener with a penalty on the hour mark but saw his effort saved by @entity15 goalkeeper @entity14			1
the away goal for @entity2 could be vital as the second - place @entity19 side look to take the initiative in the return leg at the @entity22 next week			0
@entity0 runs over to team - mate @entity23 to celebrate his equalising goal for @entity2 against @entity15 @entity10 celebrates scoring the opening goal for @entity15 but it was @entity2 who would later be laughing @entity15 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity14 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 46 minutes ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 72 ) ; @entity37 , @entity10 ( @entity38 81 ) , @entity39			1

the hosts started stronger , and it was no surprise when @entity39 fashioned the chance for the opening goal after 17 minutes			1
@entity39 has been a revelation since arriving in @entity19 on loan from @entity77 , with six goals in seven appearances , and he continued his good run of form by playing @entity10 in for the opener			1
with @entity15 on the counter-attack , @entity39 picked up the ball on the left flank - slightly unfamiliar for him - and drove forward at pace			1
no challenges came in and the @entity88 had the simple task of slipping the ball between two defenders to the feet of @entity10 , who took a touch to compose himself before smashing a left - footed drive past @entity48 at his near post			2
@entity2 came more into it as the half went on and missed good opportunities through @entity59 and @entity57 but they did also lose both captain @entity99 and @entity50 to injury			0
@entity101 also picked up a booking meaning he will miss the second leg in the @entity7 capital			0
after the break the two sides edged back into their shells a little in fear of giving away more of an advantage , but the game burst back into life on the hour mark			0
@entity15 fans hold up an impressive tifo mosaic at the @entity116 stadium ahead of the last - 16 tie @entity10 's shot flies into the net at @entity48 's near post after he latched on to @entity39 's pass @entity10 ( hidden ) is mobbed by his team - mates after opening the scoring at the @entity116 stadium @entity59 broke clear down the right and , one - on - one with @entity14 , tried to dodge past the @entity15 keeper but was brought down			1
the protests were fierce as the @entity127 clearly got a hand to the ball but referee @entity70 refused to waver			0
@entity5 stepped up and hit the penalty hard and low but @entity14 dived low to his right to palm it away			2
@entity127 goalkeeper @entity14 brought down @entity59 to give away a penalty on the hour mark but @entity14 swept himself down , got back between the sticks and brilliantly saved @entity5 's penalty but @entity2 were not to be denied for too long			1
just 17 minutes later @entity0 found space to nod in @entity57 's corner and grab the crucial away goal			2
@entity15 could have restored a lead moments later but @entity32 was brilliantly stopped by @entity48			0
but it was not enough , @entity2 take a slender lead back to the @entity22 next thursday			0
@entity0 crashed in an equaliser with his head to give @entity2 the first - leg advantage on thursday @entity0 found himself in acres of space to level the scores and put @entity2 in the driving seat of the tie @entity39 set up @entity15 's opening goal with a bursting run but it was not enough to secure the win			1

@entity39 set up @entity10 to open the scoring in the 17th minute
@entity5 had the chance to equalise but his penalty was saved
@entity0 was *allowed* a free header with *13* minutes left to equalise
