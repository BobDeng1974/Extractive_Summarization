@entity1 defender @entity0 scored an outstanding equaliser in the closing stages of his side 's match to cancel out what appeared to be a winning goal by @entity8			1
@entity8 's former @entity10 team - mate @entity9 had a nightmare start to the @entity13 derby by receiving a yellow card inside the first two minutes before handling inside the penalty area and hacking down @entity16			1
however @entity9 managed to compose himself to stay on the pitch for the remainder of the game			0
here , @entity21 's @entity20 gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players			0
@entity26 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity27 – for some reason , @entity1 did n’t look to take advantage of his shaking confidence			0
never looks like he is totally comfortable – 5.5 @entity32 – nothing headline grabbing from the @entity35 right - back but is becoming a dependable figure in @entity26 ’s defence – 7 @entity38 – if he was vulnerable at @entity39 , he looked commanding here with another week ’s training under his belt – 7.5 @entity38 showed why he is one of the first names on @entity45 ' teamsheet with a fine display @entity47 – been an erratic start to life at @entity50 for the @entity52 international but this , a few glitches apart , was his best performance to date – 7 @entity56 – he has made a bright impression since arriving from @entity58 and continued that here , providing energy and stell down the left – 7.5 @entity8 – big game , big goal , sound display			2
relished the opportunity to silence his critics with a dipping free - kick , never wasted a pass – 8 @entity8 silenced the doubters by scoring what appeared to be the winning goal in the 65th minute @entity72 – the top midfielder on the pitch			1
seemed to covered every yard , passed the wall and relished driving his team forward – 8.5 @entity79 – a thorn in the side of @entity1 ’s defenders , buzzed forward whenever the chance allowed , providing a succession of dangerous balls – 8 @entity86 – growing into the role of a @entity26 player , unlucky not to score against the team he supported as a boy with a thumping header – 7.5 @entity92 – looks anything but a £ 20million forward at the minute			2
struggled to make any kind of impression and froze whenever he did get the ball – 5 @entity16 – moments of the sublime , moments of the ridiculous			0
should really have finished his first @entity13 derby with two goals – 6 @entity16 came close to scoring his first @entity105 goal since joining the red side of @entity13 @entity107 @entity108 ( for @entity86 ) , @entity109 ( for @entity16 88mins ) unused @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity109 , @entity108 , @entity114 , @entity115 manager @entity45 – managers get paid to make the crucial decision and in the 64th minute , @entity45 hollered at @entity16 that he wanted @entity8 to take a free - kick rather than the @entity120			2
the result was @entity26 ’s goal – 7.5 @entity45 instructed his captain to take three free - kick which led to @entity26 's opening goal @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity126 – undid all the good work of keeping @entity26 at bay in the first 45 minutes when he failed to deal with @entity8 ’s free - kick – 5.5 @entity130 – rare start for the veteran right - back and found it hard work trying to contain @entity79 at times during the second half – 5.5 @entity0 – @entity1 ’s saviour with a goal that will almost certainly rank as the best of his career			1
had impressed with his defending too – 8 @entity0 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after levelling the scoring in the closing stages @entity144 – easy to see why he is being touted as a future @entity10 central defender			0
composed throughout , worked well with @entity0 – 7 @entity146 – mixed bag from the left - back , some good moments in the first half but not so much in the second period			0
energy never dropped – 6.5 @entity146 , pictured challenging @entity86 , helped his side claim a point at @entity50 @entity155 – top midfielder for @entity1 , tackled everything that came near him and tried to drive his team forward			1
passing not always the best – 7 @entity9 – had an erratic first 10 minutes when he was booked and may have been sent - off			0
seemed to rattle him for the rest of the game – 5.5 @entity9 was lucky to escape a second yellow card inside the opening half of saturday 's match at @entity50 @entity164 – lots of energy and hard work			1
is n’t in the team to do the skilful jobs but a competent first start for @entity1 nonetheless – 7 @entity171 – played on the right of an attacking three but never made any impact after failing to get a penalty in the first couple of minutes – 5 @entity177 – been a key performer for @entity1 this season but he was played in a different position here and did n’t see enough of the ball – 6 @entity183 – was just starting to get into top gear when he damaged his hamstring midway through the first half			0
looks set for a lengthy lay - off – 6 @entity1 's @entity183 was forced off in the 31st minute after picking up a hamstring injury @entity107 @entity191 6 ( @entity183 31 ) , @entity192 ( for @entity130 73 ) , @entity193 ( for @entity194 80 ) unused @entity195 ( gk ) , @entity196 , @entity193 , @entity197 , @entity192 , @entity198 manager @entity200 – celebrated the equalising goal as if the result was never in doubt			2
went with a different formation and seemedmore intent on not losing the contest rather than going to win it – 6.5 goals – @entity8 ( 64 ) , @entity0 ( 90 +1 ) booked – @entity9 , @entity8 attendance – 44,511 referee – @entity211 – 6 @entity105 official @entity211 should have shown @entity9 a second yellow card during first half			1

@entity8 scored what appeared to be the winning goal at @entity50 in the 65th minute
however @entity0 netted outstanding half *volley* to claim point
@entity1 midfielder @entity9 escaped a second yellow card
@entity79 should have been *awarded* a penalty after his shot struck @entity9 's hand
