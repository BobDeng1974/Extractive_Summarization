@entity0 says he reported to the @entity1 that he had been told @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 all had access to a parody @entity9 @entity8 account			1
@entity0 made the claims on wednesday night , saying he was told by the account 's owner , @entity11 , at a test match in 2012			1
the ' @entity15 ' account is a prominent topic in @entity9 's autobiography , published this week			2
@entity9 cites the account as one example of a culture of ' bullying ' inside the @entity1 dressing room			1
@entity3 and @entity4 are among three @entity1 players said to have had access to parody account @entity9 claims there was a bullying culture inside the @entity1 camp @entity11 is a cricket fan and a friend of @entity3 , but has always maintained he ran the account alone with no input from the dressing room , telling the @entity33 on wednesday : ' they 100 per cent did not tweet from it			1
' @entity4 used his column in wednesday 's edition of @entity38 to refute the claims , insisting that while he did follow it , he did not have a hand in running it			1
that came after @entity9 's book told a story of @entity0 claiming @entity11 had confided in him that three members of the @entity1 team had access to the account			1
angered that his ' integrity ' had been questioned by @entity11 's denial , @entity0 told @entity52 : ' the reason i am prepared to talk about is that he ( @entity11 ) has said he did n't say anything to me and therefore is doubting my integrity and i wo n't have that			1
@entity0 passed on information he received to the @entity1 ' i are n't here to nail @entity9 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity2			1
i 'm an @entity60 player and an @entity1 fan			1
' what happened , back in 2012 at the @entity64 , at the top tier of the @entity66 at the @entity67 of the ground , this gentleman came up and said to me : ' i understand you follow the @entity15 twitter account '			2
' i said ' yes , some of it is funny , some of it is close to the bone '			2
he then said ' that is me ' , i said ' very good , well done '			2
he then came back and said , ' can i keep a secret ? ' , i said ' yes , but it depends what you 're going to tell me '			0
' he said ' i ca n't tell you ' and then walked away			0
thirty seconds later he came back and said ' three players have access to the account , they have the password ' and he told me the three names			1
@entity87 ( right ) was made aware of the information , says @entity0 ' the names were @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 and it did n't sit comfortably with me			1
not because i wanted them three players to get fined , but it did n't sit comfortably with me if what he was saying was factually correct			2
' i then made @entity95 , and @entity87 at a later date , aware of the conversation , passed on that information and left it at that			1
if the @entity1 wanted to investigate or ignore , they could			2
' i 'm not going to doubt what @entity9 , @entity3 , @entity4 , or whoever has said but i will guarantree 100 per cent this lad said that to me			1
' there was no comment from the @entity1 on @entity0 's claims on wednesday night			1
@entity0 's comments came after @entity9 described the @entity1 as ' dinosaurs ... shooting themselves in the foot '			1
@entity2 is the third @entity1 player said to have had access to the parody account the sacked batsman was referring to the emergence on tuesday night of a leaked document , which appeared to log the @entity1 's list of his alleged misdemeanours during last winter 's descent to ashes whitewash in @entity122			1
a month after his return , @entity9 was told he would not be picked by @entity1 again - bringing an apparent end to his record - breaking but controversial career			2
as he was promoting his autobiography in a series of interviews , the document - which @entity1 swiftly made clear was a draft of a private internal email - somehow came into the possession of website @entity132			2
it is unclear how the document reached the public domain but was , in any case , a turn of events which did not impress @entity9			0
@entity9 has accused the @entity1 of shooting themselves in the foot over a leaked document speaking before an appearance on @entity143 's the @entity142 , to be broadcast on thursday , he said in quotes carried on @entity145 : ' i think there are times in your life where you shoot yourselves in the foot , and i do n't think the @entity1 helped themselves last night			2
' it 's embarrassing what happened last night			0
' when you 're dealing with dinosaurs that do n't understand social media they are going to shoot themselves in the foot - and they 've done it			0
' several issues are sure to rear their head again along with plenty of others as @entity9 continues a marathon promotional tour			0
but the 34 - year - old had braced himself for the experience			0
' i said to my wife and ' team ' last week , ' this week will be carnage - i 'll be in the eye of the storm , and it 'll happen and then it 'll go			0
'' former @entity175 captain @entity174 has corroborated @entity9 's claim of bullying @entity9 's recollection of bullying on the field , often directed by bowlers towards fielders who made mistakes , has been corroborated by former @entity122 captain @entity174			0
he has made it clear in an interview with the @entity175 press that he too often noticed the intimidating behaviour among his @entity121 opponents			0
@entity9 said : ' you write books like this when you 've got evidence to back it up and you 've got people who are prepared to back it up			0
' i have n't even spoken to @entity197 [ @entity174 ]			0
when i woke up this morning and i saw this , one of the greatest cricketers to have ever played the game , how do you think he views it when he 's in the opposition and he 's seeing team - mates abuse each other and bully each other on a cricket field ? ' how do you reckon it feels for the individuals that are going through it in the dressing room			0
i 've been speaking to the coach about it for years			0
' ' six months ' time , you never know , there could be a change at the top , i live in hope			0
and one day i hope to be able to play test cricket again			0
if i got the call now , i 'd leave your show ! '			0
