by @entity1 reporter published : 19:48 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 7 august 2013 a deadly strain of avian flu may have passed between people for the first time , experts believe			1
the avian influenza a ( @entity9 ) virus is thought to have been transmitted between father and daughter in eastern @entity12 , according to research published online by the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
the findings provide the strongest evidence yet of @entity9 transmission between humans , but its ability to transmit itself is ' limited and non-sustainable ' , the experts believe			2
researchers , including from the @entity23 and @entity24 and the @entity25 and @entity24 , presented evidence on the strain , which emerged in eastern @entity12 in february			1
it is believed the virus has now spread between humans as of the end of june , 133 cases have been reported , leading to 43 deaths			1
most cases have been among people visiting markets selling live birds or among those who had contact with live poultry in the seven to 10 days before becoming ill. the latest study examined the case of a 60 - year - old father who regularly visited a live poultry market and became ill five to six days after his last visit in march			0
he was admitted to hospital with fever , cough and shortness of breath but , despite intensive care treatment , died of multiple organ failure on may 4			1
bird flu epidemic : a market inspector burns dead chickens seized from a poultry centre in this file picture his 32 - year - old daughter , who was previously healthy , looked after him at his bedside before he was admitted to intensive care			0
she had no known exposure to live poultry before falling ill with a very high temperature , cough and fever			0
the daughter developed symptoms six days after her last contact with her father and was admitted to hospital			0
despite intensive care treatment , she died of multiple organ failure on april 24			1
follow - up investigations revealed almost genetically identical virus strains from each patient , suggesting transmission from father to daughter			1
another 43 people were also tested who had had close contact with the father , daughter or both			1
one had suffered a mild illness but did not test positively for the avian flu strain			0
the others showed no signs of exposure			0
dr @entity97 , senior clinical research fellow at the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , said of the study : ' the most likely source of infection for the daughter was her father , during the period that she cared from him whilst he was ill. ' he said limited person to person transmission had been reported for other strains , @entity109 and @entity110 , and the swine origin flu virus @entity112			2
he said the strains have been around for more than a decade , but ' have not progressed any further down the path towards a pandemic virus '			0
a breeder covers his face as he is forced to close his business because of fears over the @entity9 virus , in @entity121 township , @entity123 province he added : ' limited human - to - human transmission of @entity9 virus is therefore not surprising , and , like @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity112 , does not necessarily represent the early stages of a trajectory towards full adaptation to humans			2
' dr @entity97 said , however , that intensive surveillance was needed , including of the dose of virus needed to infect people and the role of repeated exposure to the strain			2
professor @entity138 , chair in influenza virology at @entity140 , added : ' the editorial accompanying this paper on human transmission is spot on - there was no genetic change in the virus and it is not surprising that under close contact some transmission is seen			0

@entity9 strain believed to be passed from father to daughter in eastern @entity12
the virus has *affected* 133 people so far , killing 43
father and daughter both died of multiple organ failure
