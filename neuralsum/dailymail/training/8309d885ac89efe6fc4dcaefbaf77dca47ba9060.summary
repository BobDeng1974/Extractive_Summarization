by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 02:58 est , 25 april 2012 if you lived in a place with a @entity4 church , a @entity4 war memorial and a @entity6 would you fancy a trip to a town featuring @entity10 pubs and @entity10 restaurants ? that 's what lies in store for the residents of the small settlement of @entity4 in @entity17 as the community gears up to formally link with the town of boring situated in the @entity21 some 5,542 miles away			1
a bond has been formed between the @entity17 village near @entity24 in @entity25 and the equally unexciting sounding town in @entity27 following talks between @entity4 and @entity29 and @entity30			1
drive through : the town of @entity10 in @entity27 , @entity21 and the village of @entity4 in @entity17 have forged a common bond over the uninspiring names of the settlements the idea of bringing the two places together emerged after @entity38 , from @entity39 , in @entity25 , passed through the @entity21 town while on a cycling holiday			2
she then decided to share the news of her exciting discovery with her @entity4 friend @entity44 and chairman of the @entity30 @entity46			2
mr @entity46 was interested in exploring the possibility of developing a relationship between @entity4 and @entity10 and he put together a plan to invite those living in @entity4 to take on ' @entity52 ' status when @entity53 meets in june			0
exciting times : they may be more than 9,000 miles apart but the communities of @entity4 and @entity10 are set to become close friends confirming the move , @entity4 community councillor @entity58 received a ' declaration of @entity61 ' from the logging town in @entity27 on thursday			1

' everyone has been smiling at the prospect of the very eye - catching road sign this will inevitably require			0
' it will be interesting to see where this goes			0
' name game : the town of @entity10 ( right ) is too big to formally twin with @entity4 in @entity17 ( left ) but @entity4 could become a sister community or boring boring is too large when compared with @entity4 to qualify for official twinning status , but the two communities are hoping to create a close bond			1
community council chairman @entity82 joked : ' we might experience traffic incidents when people see the sign by the road			0
' it ’s bad enough when people stop dead to photograph the signpost for @entity4			0
' imagine how many people would do a double - take if it said welcome to @entity4 , a @entity92 ? '			0

new sign could read ' welcome to @entity4 , sister community of boring '
