the @entity3 leader had previously rejected offers of help and insisted the @entity2 no longer had ‘ any more doubts ’ about the quality of the investigation following ambassador - level talks			1
‘ they simply needed more time to understand it all because we managed to arrest suspects swiftly , even though it seemed impossible at the beginning , ’ he was reported to have said			0
but diplomatic sources said he had finally accepted the sending of a delegation of @entity2 police when pressed on the issue by mr @entity0 at the @entity94 in @entity95			1
‘ obviously it is for the @entity3 authorities to lead and carry out that judicial process , ’ a diplomatic source said			0
‘ but it is important that it is fair and transparent and that both of the families can be reassured that it is the murderers that have been brought to justice			0
’ the source added : ‘ there are two areas we are particularly concerned about			0
one if the verification of the dna samples of the suspects , making sure there is further independent verification			0
‘ and the second is the investigation into allegations of mistreatment of the suspects			0
‘ what the @entity120 secured this morning was agreement from the @entity123 that we can send some @entity2 police investigators to @entity126 to work with the @entity127 on this			1
’ mr @entity14 , from @entity128 , died from drowning and a blow to the head , while @entity132 , from @entity133 , died from head wounds			2

the families of the @entity20 workers have said they are innocent , claiming the case has been rigged against them			2
the families of the accused men told the @entity167 they believe they did not commit the crime , with @entity170 ’s mother adding that the ordeal has left her suicidal			0
‘ the case has been rigged against my son , ’ said @entity142 ’s mother			0
in the days after the murders , @entity174 was forced to apologise for suggesting beautiful tourists put themselves at risk by wearing bikinis			0
the @entity120 , who seized power in a coup in may , was reported to say pretty women made themselves more vulnerable to attacks by wearing a bikini he said : ‘ there are always problems with tourist safety			2
‘ they think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want , they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere			0
