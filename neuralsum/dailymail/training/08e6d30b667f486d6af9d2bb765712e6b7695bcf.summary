@entity1 presenter @entity0 on sunday night moved to clarify why the @entity2 had not shown @entity5 's @entity4 giant killing against @entity6 live on tv			1
the @entity8 knocked out another @entity10 club following their 4 - 2 win over @entity12 in the fourth round to book their place in the last eight of the competition			2
but the @entity2 came in for criticism because the 2 - 0 win against @entity21 's side was one of only three fifth - round ties not to feature on live tv , either on the @entity2 or @entity25			1
@entity0 confirmed on @entity26 that @entity5 was not selected for tv because the @entity2 had to choose the live games before their opponents were known @entity31 goalscorer @entity30 joked during his post-match interview that the fifth - round tie against @entity6 should have been shown on tv @entity31 striker @entity30 joked during his post-match interview for @entity2 that the game at @entity36 was ' a great cup tie ' and that it ' should have been on the tv ' , a comment that left the interviewer lost for words			1
back in the studio @entity0 revealed the reason why @entity12 's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live , despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards			2
' i do have an answer on that subject , ' the presenter said			0
' and it comes from the @entity2 football management who say the following : " they had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore could n’t be sure who @entity5 would be at home to			2
if they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it "			0
' @entity63 and @entity64 were subject to a cheeky tweet from @entity31 following their @entity4 win @entity68 presenter @entity0 was also targeted by @entity31 's cheeky tweet @entity6 needed a replay to beat @entity72 side @entity71 in the fourth round and the @entity2 had to select the live games before the tie was decided , with the corporation instead opting to show the all @entity10 clash between @entity77 and @entity78			1
@entity63 had earlier claimed the @entity2 would have screened @entity31 's fifth - round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth - round replays			1
and the @entity83 side did n't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at @entity85 and @entity86 following the @entity6 win			0
the presenter tweeted : ' the @entity2 can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays			0
if they could 've waited @entity31 would obviously have been chosen			0
' @entity93 ( centre ) fires @entity95 ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over @entity6 @entity30 ( right ) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the @entity4 fifth round giant killing @entity31 fans made their feelings known during the match , causing embarrassment for one veteran @entity2 presenter			1
look @entity110 stalwart @entity109 tweeted : ' i am in trouble			0
filmed singing are you watching @entity2			0
@entity63 led the @entity2 's coverage from @entity116 as the home side held on for a 2 - 1 victory in a match that only came to life in the final stages			1
the poor fare on offer prompted @entity68 presenter @entity0 to write on @entity124 : ' we 're debating whether this goes last on tonight 's @entity126 or whether we leave it off altogether			2
' @entity128 was the mastermind of yet another cup shock with @entity31 at the @entity36 @entity21 looks on after seeing his side embarrassed at the hands of the @entity83 outfit			0

@entity0 confirmed the reason why @entity5 's giant killing against @entity6 was not shown live on tv
@entity31 tweeted @entity63 and @entity0 following their @entity4 fifth - round victory over @entity10 side @entity6
the @entity68 presenter *insists* that the tie would of been shown live if the @entity2 had known their opponents prior to the *decision*
