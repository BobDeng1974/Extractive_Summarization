these stunning images capture the way young people in @entity3 are defying the country 's hardline @entity5 image to create a more westernised society			1
taken in the capital @entity10 , the photographs show teenagers and people in their early 20s kissing in public , drinking alcohol and living openly gay lifestyles			0
some of those pictured are even seen wearing clothing adorned with the @entity18 - something previously unthinkable in a country where the conservative religious and political leadership still regularly leads chants of ' @entity24 ' at public meetings			0
new era : people kiss and dance at a masquerade house party in the @entity3 capital where alcohol is being served and consumed modern : a group of young @entity3 laugh as they wear fancy dress costumes at a party where they drink alcohol , kiss and dance political : some of those pictured are even seen wearing clothing adorned with the @entity18 - something previously unthinkable in a country where the conservative religious and political leadership still regularly leads chants of ' @entity24 ' at public meetings celebration : a group of @entity46 @entity3 are seen heading in to the country 's desert where they have illegal , alocohol - fuelled parties peace and love : young people in @entity3 are defying the country 's hardline @entity5 image to create a more westernised society young people represent the largest societal bloc in @entity3 , with over 63 per cent of @entity3 's population of 73 million people aged under 30			1
the @entity3 youth is also among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the @entity5 world			1
as the most restive segment of @entity3 society , the young also represent one of the greatest long - term threats to the current form of theocratic rule			1
young activists have influenced the @entity74 's political agenda since 1997			2
after the 2009 presidential election , the @entity3 youth was the biggest bloc involved in the region 's first sustained ' people power ' movement for democratic change , which helped create a new political dynamic in the @entity82			1
in many ways the highly - politicised largely @entity84 youth of @entity3 can be seen as a forerunner of the @entity88 movement that swept the @entity89 in 2011			1
change : a woman gives the peace sign as she poses for a portrait in front of a mural of the @entity95 at a closed @entity97 embassy head over heels : a young man is seen taking part in parkour , where contestants have to find unorthodox ways of moving around the city young people represent the largest societal bloc in @entity3 , with over 63 per cent of @entity3 's population of 73 million people aged under 30 taken in the capital @entity10 , the photographs show people in their early 20s engaging in music , street art and living openly gay lifestyles making a change : the @entity3 youth is among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the @entity5 world unconventional : a young parkour performer runs , jumps and climbs on metal railings outside a mosque in the @entity3 capital @entity10 the @entity74 of @entity3 forcibly regained control over the most rebellious sector of society through detentions , expulsions from universities , and expanding the powers of its own young paramilitary forces following the rise of the ' people power ' movement in 2009			1
but youth demands have not changed , and anger simmers beneath the surface			0
the regime also remains vulnerable because it has failed to address basic socio - economic problems among the young			2
the will of young people in @entity3 has also influenced @entity3 's changing relationship with the @entity97 , which has just come to preliminary nuclear agreement with the @entity74			1
the biggest enforcement provision in that agreement is turning into one of the mostly hotly contested elements , however			0
and the debate barely involves @entity3			2
instead , it concerns the @entity152 administration 's promise to quickly re-impose sanctions on @entity3 if the country cheats on any part of the agreement to limit its nuclear program to peaceful pursuits			2
this would be relatively straightforward for the sanctions imposed by the @entity97 , as @entity160 is eager to keep the pressure on			0
but it is far from clear whether president @entity152 can guarantee such action at the @entity164 , which has imposed wide - ranging penalties that all @entity164 members must enforce as the most restive segment of @entity3 society , the young also represent one of the greatest long - term threats to @entity3 's theocratic rule hip hop and break dance performers pose for the camera as the dance in the streets of the modern @entity179 neighbourhood of @entity10 taking a stand : young activists have had a massive influence on the @entity74 of @entity3 's political agenda since 1997 love and religion : a gay couple kiss one another while holding a copy of the @entity188 as a symbol of the struggle for change in @entity3 a young @entity3 is seen driving in to the country 's desert to join one of the many illegal , alcohol - fuelled parties hosted there at present , there 's no firm agreement on how or when to lift the sanctions in the first place			1
ayatollah @entity200 , @entity3 's supreme leader , and president @entity202 yesterday said they want all sanctions lifted on the first day of implementation			1
that 's not the position of @entity97 and other negotiators , a major issue that still must be worked out			0
assuming it can be , that still would leave the big question of possible re-imposition			0
the disagreement on this issue is between the @entity97 and its @entity215 allies on one side , and @entity217 and @entity218 on the other - all countries involved in the nuclear negotiations			0
and even though all six world powers and @entity3 agreed last week to the framework agreement that is supposed to be finalized by june 30 , the ' snapback ' mechanism for @entity164 sanctions remains poorly defined and may prove unworkable			1
' if @entity3 violates the deal , sanctions can be snapped back into place , ' @entity152 declared last week			2
controversial : a young @entity3 woman stands in front of an old piece of political graffiti reading ' down with @entity97 ' a young man is seen taking part in parkour , where contestants have to find unorthodox ways of moving around the city bouncing around the city : a young man is seen taking part in parkour in the capital of the @entity3 , @entity10 westernised : the will of young people in @entity3 has also influenced @entity3 's changing relationship with the @entity97 superman : a young parkour performer runs , jumps and climbs over a concrete bench outside a mosque in the @entity3 capital @entity10 defying the regime : it is illegal for people to kiss in public in @entity3 - something man young people choose to ignore @entity152 went further this week , saying that restoring the international sanctions would not require consensus among @entity261 members			1
and energy secretary @entity262 , who helped seal last week 's pact , insisted ' no one country could block the snapback			0
' that assertion rests on an informal compromise reached at the talks in @entity269 , @entity270 , to bypass the typical @entity261 process if @entity3 breaks the agreement			2
normally in that body , any one of the five permanent members - the @entity97 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity217 and @entity218 , which are all party to the @entity3 negotiations - can veto resolutions			2
but many questions remain , including what would happen if two or more countries object			0
@entity217 and @entity218 have traditionally opposed almost all @entity164 sanctions measures , and , perhaps tellingly , neither country 's foreign minister was present when the april 2 framework was unveiled			0
@entity288 and its negotiating partners plan to suspend or lift many sanctions after the @entity164 nuclear agency confirms @entity3 has scaled back its activity in accordance with a final deal			0
but the @entity97 and its @entity215 partners want the capacity to quickly reinstate the restrictions if @entity3 reneges .			0

people aged under 30 currently represent a *staggering* 63 per cent of @entity3 's population of 73 million citizens
the westernised @entity3 youth is also among the most politically active groups within the @entity5 world
the young also represent one of the greatest long - term threats to the current form of theocratic rule in @entity3
