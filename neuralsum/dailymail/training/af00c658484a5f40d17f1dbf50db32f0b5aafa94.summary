@entity8 understands that , although nothing has been finalised , the 28 - year - old is considering his options and could leave @entity12 this summer if a severance deal is agreed with the @entity15 club			1

that ’s a bridge i ’ll have to cross pretty soon and i ’m looking forward to doing it			0
i would love to go back to @entity27 one day			0
