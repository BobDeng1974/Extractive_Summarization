by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 19:15 est , 30 december 2012 @entity2 veteran @entity1 was criticised last night for describing @entity3 as ‘ a pneumatic bird - brain from @entity5 ’			1
while many agreed with his view that @entity2 coverage of the @entity11 river pageant was ‘ cringingly inept ’ , they said it was wrong to single out presenters rather than bosses			1
others took to the internet to describe his remarks in a @entity19 article – which saw him call the presenters ‘ airheads ’ – as cruel and accused him of being grumpy			1
' ashamed of the @entity2 ' @entity1 called presenter @entity3 ' a pneumatic bird - brain from @entity5 ' in an end - of - year comment piece , the 66 - year - old former newsreader argued that the spectacle of the @entity11 was ‘ betrayed ’ by the @entity2 ’s dumbed - down coverage			1
‘ the one enduring @entity30 institution [ the @entity29 ] was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way , ’ he wrote			0
‘ on the screen , a succession of @entity36 airheads preened themselves , or gossiped with even more vacuous d - list “ celebrities ”			0
with barely an exception , they were cringingly inept			1
’ he then focused on miss @entity3 ’s talent as a news presenter			2
he said : ‘ the @entity45 , the most evocative reminders of this country ’s bravest hour , were ignored so that a pneumatic bird - brain from @entity5 could talk to transvestites in @entity51			2
‘ i was so ashamed of the @entity2 i would have wept if i had n’t been so angry			2
the worst thing was that it was deliberate – planned that way to be “ light ” and “ inclusive ”			0
’ some critics said while they agreed with his analysis , they objected to what they saw as a personal attack on @entity60			1
just not good enough : @entity1 was highly critical of the @entity2 's coverage of the @entity62 - which included @entity3 one wrote on the @entity2 ’s @entity64 message board : ‘ i did agree ... but was mystified as to why it was mainly aimed at the indians instead of the chiefs			1
’ another said while it was ‘ generally agreed ’ the @entity2 ‘ failed miserably ’ in the coverage , to turn it into an attack on the presenters rather than those in charge was ‘ wrong ’			1
one responded on @entity75 : ‘ there is no need to be cruel about @entity3			0
’ but there was a lot of support for his view that presenters such as miss @entity3 and @entity84 had not been right for the event			0
in an interview with another sunday paper , @entity2 presenter @entity86 admitted the ‘ light entertainment ’ feel of the @entity90 had been wrong			2
‘ we want to be informed and interested , we want presenters who are well - prepared and know their stuff , ’ she said			0
‘ yes , the @entity2 should entertain , but in doing so they ’d moved too far from their remit to educate , too , and viewers did n’t like it			0
’ miss @entity3 was unavailable for comment yesterday .			0
