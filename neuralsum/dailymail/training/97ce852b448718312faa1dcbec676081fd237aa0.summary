a man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of women riding the @entity7 subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude , @entity1 ' highest court ruled wednesday			1
the @entity10 overruled a lower court that had upheld charges against @entity13 , who was arrested in august 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up female riders ' skirts and dresses			1
the ruling immediately prompted top @entity27 lawmakers to pledge to update state law			1
' a female passenger on a @entity52 trolley who is wearing a skirt , dress , or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is " partially nude , " no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing , ' the court said in its ruling			1
state law ' does not apply to photographing ( or videotaping or electronically surveilling ) persons who are fully clothed and , in particular , does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the @entity52 , ' the court said			2
the @entity10 said that while such actions should be illegal , they are not , given the way state law is written			1
@entity67 prosecutors said their interpretation of the state 's @entity36 law was that ' upskirt ' photos are illegal			1
change : district attorney @entity73 says that laws need to be changed in order for the @entity10 to criminalize ' upskirt ' photography district attorney @entity73 said prosecutors are hoping state lawmakers will change the wording of the statute by the end of this legislative session			1
' what we have is not that the @entity10 is saying this is ok , ' @entity73 said			0
' the statutory language just did n't quite fit the conduct			0
' in its ruling , the court said that other states , including @entity91 and @entity92 , have passed laws specifically criminalizing upskirt photos , noting that women have an expectation of privacy under their clothing			1
@entity100 lawmakers closed a loophole in that state 's voyeurism law a decade ago , after a similar ruling there			1
@entity73 added that this conduct has become more and more prevalent , and he urged riders to be alert			0
' this action is immoral and reprehensible ; do n't do it , ' he said			0
a telephone message left with @entity111 , @entity13 's attorney , was not immediately returned			2
@entity113 president @entity112 said she was ' stunned and disappointed ' with the court ruling			2
she said the @entity113 will respond quickly			0
' we have fought too hard and too long for women 's rights to take the step backward , ' @entity115 said in a statement			2
' i am in disbelief that the courts would come to this kind of decision and outraged at what it means for women 's privacy and public safety			2
' awareness : @entity73 says that this conduct has become more and more prevalent , and he urged riders to be on the lookout for any upskirt photogs @entity133 , executive director of the @entity134 , said such photos are a serious invasion of privacy			1
she said the law needs to catch up to technology			2
' it really is a form of sexual harassment			0
it 's a violation for the person who is unknowingly getting their body photographed , ' she said			1
' people wear clothing for a reason and having someone violate that privacy is a real problem			0
' @entity52 spokesman @entity152 said that @entity153 support the @entity67 district attorney 's efforts to work with the @entity156 in rewriting the statute			0
he did not say what the @entity52 could do in the meantime to prevent the activity			0
@entity152 said that in the past three years , @entity162 police have investigated 13 ' secretly photographing ' cases			0
in some cases , the alleged offender was issued a court summons			0
during those three years there was an average of 395 million passenger trips on the @entity52 .			0

currently , @entity1 law says it 's only illegal to photograph a person without their *consent* if they are nude or partially nude
the ruling stems from the case of @entity182 , who was arrested in a sting operation after using his phone to take ' upskirt ' photos and videos on the subway
*community* *leaders* are urging lawmakers to update the law to include ' upskirt ' photos of people wearing underwear
