he keeps his business well - lit and continually has two to four employees inside to ensure ' there 's always an extra hand or two ' in case of trouble			2
authorities blame many of the carjackings , ironically , on improvements in vehicle security			1
anti-theft equipment , gps systems and advanced locks now prevent many vehicles from being driven without a key in the ignition			2
that makes it difficult or impossible for thieves to steal parked cars , leading them to target vehicles that are occupied , said @entity82 , of @entity22 's auto - theft squad			1
also contributing to the thefts is a strong demand for stolen wheels and tires , police said			0
through may 19 , @entity22 has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014			1

@entity22 police reported 720 carjackings last year in the city of fewer than 700,000 people			1
that 's down from nearly 850 in 2011 and 1,231 in 2008			0
the decline may partly be due to @entity22 's freefalling population , but the thefts still exceed the carjackings in some comparably sized @entity134 cities			1

' if the night catches me , i wo n't pump gas in the city , ' she said			2
' or i 'll call somebody to meet me			0

@entity174 , @entity175 , with a population of 280,000 , had 382 carjackings last year , giving it a per capita rate that is actually higher than @entity22 's			1
@entity179 , @entity180 , with a population of 655,000 , had slightly more than 400 carjackings over three years from 2011 through 2013			2
@entity183 , a rapidly growing western @entity185 city of 670,000 , reported only 15 carjackings last year and 18 in 2012			2
through may 19 , @entity22 has recorded 191 carjackings in 2014 , including the feb. 24 shooting death of @entity190 security guard @entity189 , who rushed toward a car being taken by three men , and the feb. 4 slaying of @entity194 , a 68 - year - old man who was beaten to death with a tire iron after he was carjacked at an intersection			1
prosecutors , the @entity173 and @entity22 police recently announced a campaign to spread the word about stiffer federal penalties for carjacking , which can include the death penalty if someone is killed			2

the 27 - year - old mother of two wo n't stop for gas in @entity22			1
she lives north of the city in @entity230 and works four days a week cleaning offices downtown			0

' it 's not a safe place anymore , ' @entity232 said			0
' the state - appointed emergency manager tasked with restructuring @entity22 's $ 18 billion in debt has said crime needs to be reduced to make the city attractive to new residents and businesses			1
that 's going to take more and better resources , said @entity251 prosecutor @entity250 , who complains that she has only a few assistants to try carjackings			0
' when nobody has any resources ... all we can be is reactive , ' she said .			0

some gas station display a green - decal with a lighthouse , *meaning* they are participating in the city 's anti-carjacking program , but many other stations are on a waiting list
improvements in vehicle anti-theft systems mean that car thieves have to targets cars as they are occupied
