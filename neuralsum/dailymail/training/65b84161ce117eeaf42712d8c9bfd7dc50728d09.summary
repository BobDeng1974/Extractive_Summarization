by @entity0 published : 23:46 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 7 june 2013 a new non-invasive blood test to detect whether or not an unborn baby has @entity4 's syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy is to go on trial next month a new non-invasive blood test which can reliably detect whether or not an unborn baby has @entity4 ’s syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy is to go on trial at two hospitals next month			1
the test , which analyses a baby ’s dna present in its mother ’s blood , could be an improvement on current screening methods , according to researchers			2
@entity4 ’s syndrome , and other chromosomal disorders characterised by an additional chromosome , is currently tested for between the 11th and 13th weeks of a pregnancy , using an ultrasound screen and a hormonal analysis of the pregnant woman ’s blood			2
those deemed at high risk of carrying a baby with such a disorder are then given a definitive test involving chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis			0
but this is invasive and carries a risk of miscarriage			0
a study carried out at the @entity41 at @entity42 is the first to look at the feasibility of screening for the chromosomal disorders - known as trisomies - using foetal cell free dna ( @entity49 ) from a pregnant woman ’s blood			1
the tests , carried out at the 10 - week stage on 1,005 pregnancies , were found to be more sensitive at detecting @entity4 ’s syndrome and returned fewer ' false positive ' results than the initial combined tests usually carried out between the 11th and 13th weeks			0
researchers found that up to 98 per cent of cases of @entity4 ’s syndrome could be detected			1
invasive testing was then needed for confirmation in less than 0.5 per cent of cases			0
the test costs £ 400 so will not be offered across the @entity63 at this stage , but it will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at two hospitals - @entity69 in @entity70 and @entity71 in @entity72			1
the test will initially be offered free of charge on a trial basis at @entity69 , in @entity70 ( pictured ) , and @entity71 , in @entity72 the authors of the study , published in the @entity78 in @entity80 journal , said : ' this study has shown that the main advantage of @entity49 testing , compared with the combined test , is the substantial reduction in false positive rate			1
' another major advantage of @entity49 testing is the reporting of results as very high or very low risk , which makes it easier for parents to decide in favour of or against invasive testing			0
' the authors added : ' screening by @entity49 testing contingent on the results of an expanded combined test would retain the advantages of the current method of screening , but with a simultaneous major increase in detection rate and decrease in the rate of invasive testing			0

new non-invasive test to go on trial at hospitals in @entity70 and @entity72
study looked at screening using foetal cell free dna from woman 's blood
researchers found 98 *%* of @entity4 's syndrome cases could be detected
