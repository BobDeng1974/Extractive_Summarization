by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 12 february 2013 @entity3 's schools are among the worst in the world for social mobility , a study shows			1
they were found to have some of the widest achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils in research covering more than 60 countries			1
researchers for the @entity12 who compared the reading skills of teenagers with their social backgrounds found that disadvantaged students were twice as likely to be among the poorest performers			2
poor performance : the @entity3 is ranked below average in the international comparison of social mobility , with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points higher on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers on average , an advantaged teenager scored 88 points more than a disadvantaged one on reading tests , the equivalent of more than two years of schooling			2
at the top end of the spectrum , @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 combined high results and high levels of fairness			0
the @entity3 was ranked below average , with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points more on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers			2
in september , the @entity12 said @entity3 schools were among the most socially segregated in the world , with children from immigrant backgrounds crammed into disadvantaged schools			1
the @entity3 belongs to a group of countries , including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and the @entity57 , that are successful in terms of above average results , but have lower levels of equity			1
meanwhile , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 are relatively strong on equal opportunities but have low levels of performance			0
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 perform badly in both equity and results			0
the report , are countries moving towards more @entity77 ? says that students from socio - economically advantaged and disadvantaged families ‘ should be equally likely to succeed in school ’			2
standard : the @entity3 is ranked below average in the international comparison of social mobility , with advantaged pupils scoring around 92 points higher on their 2009 reading tests than disadvantaged teenagers it says : ‘ the fact that school systems vary in the degree to which they allow socio - economic differences to become differences in performance is an indication that any obstacles posed by disadvantaged social background can be overcome			1
‘ while some of those differences may be attributable to culture , the fact that the relationship has changed significantly in some countries suggests that policy and practice can make a difference			0
‘ many countries and economies have made notable progress in narrowing the performance gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students while simultaneously improving overall performance			2
’ ‘ we must find new ways for the entire education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps			0
a child ’s education achievements must not be determined by their postcode or the wealth of their parents ' - @entity122 , chief executive of youth and education charity @entity123 @entity125 , the @entity12 ’s special adviser on education , told the @entity128 ’s education website that a long - term characteristic of the @entity3 ’s education system has been the polarisation between the results of rich and poor pupils			1
this is also a major problem for other @entity136 economies , such as @entity54 and @entity53			1
however , the big challenge is to develop education systems that do not accept widespread underachievement among poorer pupils			0
he said : ‘ in the past , economies and school systems could tolerate these inequalities			2
but the life chances are deteriorating rapidly for those without qualifications			0
there are more severe penalties			0
’ last september , a report from the @entity12 warned that the @entity3 ’s schools were among the most socially segregated in the world			1
the vast majority of children from immigrant backgrounds are crammed into disadvantaged schools with high proportions of fellow migrants			0
@entity122 , ceo of @entity123 , a youth and education charity in @entity160 , said yesterday : ‘ the latest findings from the @entity12 on social mobility in @entity3 schools paints an all too familiar picture			1
‘ we must find new ways for the entire education system to work together to narrow these attainment gaps			0
a child ’s education achievements must not be determined by their postcode or the wealth of their parents			0
’ warning : last september , a report from the @entity12 warned that the @entity3 's schools were among the most socially segregated in the world			1

@entity3 's schools among worst for achievement gaps between rich and poor
placed among @entity54 , @entity53 and the @entity57 for student achievements gaps
@entity12 report warns school systems should provide ' high quality ' educational opportunities for all students
