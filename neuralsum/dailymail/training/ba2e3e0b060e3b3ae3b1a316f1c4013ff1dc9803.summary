by @entity0 scientists have created cyborg sperm that they can control using a simple fridge magnet			2
dubbed ‘ @entity9 ’ , the bots have a metal - coated head and a bendable body that is around six times longer than human sperm			1
researchers hope their tiny mechanical creations can be used to put together nanoscale products , aid drug delivery and even help improve egg fertilisation			0
using a weak magnetic field , scientists from the @entity23 and @entity24 have made the robot ‘ swim ; forward and steered it towards a fixed point like bacteria , sperm use a whip - like ‘ flagellum ’ to move themselves through liquid			1
using a weak magnetic field , scientists from the @entity23 and @entity24 have made the robot ‘ swim ' forward and steered it towards a fixed point			1
the cyborg sperm is made from a strong plastic with a metal coating wrapped around its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation			2
when force is produced from a moving electromagnetic field , the metal element is pushed in different directions			2
in december , the first ever biological robots that are powered by sperm were created by scientists in @entity50			0
researchers managed to trap single sperm cells inside metal nanotubes and remotely control their direction using magnets like @entity9 , these biobots could be used in humans to deliver drugs to a very specific parts of the body or to help fertilise an egg			1
@entity62 at the @entity63 in @entity64 created magnetic nanotubes that were 50 microns long by 5 to 8 microns in diameter and dropped these into a fluid containing bull sperm			0
to trap the sperm and stop them from escaping , the tubes were narrower at one end and could be moved using a magnetic field , professor @entity62 told @entity74			1
‘ a sperm - driven micro-bio robot could be used for magnetically guided transport and delivery purposes in biomedical applications , ’ said professor @entity62			1
‘ of course , the vision of using magnetically guided human sperms for assisted fertilisation seems most compelling but is still far from being realised			0
' the researchers at the @entity84 in the @entity23 and @entity85 in @entity86 were able to steer the robot by directing the magnetic field lines			1
the @entity9 can move along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second , while a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time			1
‘ nature has designed efficient tools for locomotion at micro-scales , ’ said dr @entity91 , an associate professor at the @entity84			0
‘ our microrobots are either inspired from nature or directly use living micro-organisms such as magnetotactic bacteria and sperm cells for complex micro-manipulation and targeted therapy tasks			0
’ ‘ as technology progresses and many products get smaller , it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano - and micro-scales , ’ added dr @entity104 , an assistant professor of the @entity85 in @entity86			0
‘ @entity110 can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion			2
’ this is n’t the first time scientists have attempted to create robosperm			0

dubbed ‘ @entity9 ’ , the bots have a metal - coated head and a bendable body that is around six times longer than human sperm at 322 microns - long researchers hope their tiny mechanical creation can be used to put together nanoscale products , aid drug delivery and even help improve egg fertilisation ( stock image used ) researchers managed to trap single sperm cells inside metal nanotubes and remotely control their direction using magnets like @entity9 , these biobots could be used in humans to deliver drugs to a very specific parts of the body or to help fertilise an egg			1

to trap the sperm and stop them from escaping , the tubes were narrower at one end and could be moved using a magnetic field , professor @entity62 told @entity74			1
‘ the biggest challenge was to adjust the size of the micro tube to a diameter slightly larger than the sperm head by at the same time maintaining the mobility of the sperm tails , ’ he said			2
the tail - like part of the sperm cell pokes outside the end of the tube to power the biobot like a propeller			0

bots have a metal - coated head and are 6 times longer than human sperm
in a magnetic field , the metal sperm - head is pushed in different directions
scientists were able to steer the robot by directing the magnetic field lines
the @entity9 can move along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second , while a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time
