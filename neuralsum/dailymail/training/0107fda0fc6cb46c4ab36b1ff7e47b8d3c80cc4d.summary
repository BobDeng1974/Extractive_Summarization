by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was facing turmoil last night after one of his own mps condemned his strategy as ‘ suicidal ’ and a @entity8 parliamentary candidate was secretly recorded describing his leadership as ‘ dodgy ’ and ‘ incoherent ’			1
the outbreak of open dissent – just days before crunch elections – followed a week of mounting panic in the party after the @entity15 recorded a lead in the polls for the first time in more than two years			1
@entity5 have been privately briefing this weekend that if mr @entity2 does not ‘ show progress ’ in thursday ’s local and @entity25 election results , they would collectively break ranks to call for ‘ a mass shake - up ’ of strategy and personnel			1
labour leader @entity2 , left , introduced his new @entity27 advisor @entity26 , right , to his shadow cabinet earlier this week the scale of the nervousness is revealed in a public broadside today from @entity33 mp @entity32 , who urges mr @entity2 to abandon his strategy of ‘ relying on the government ’s unpopularity ’ to win next year ’s general election			1
‘ sooner or later the @entity41 were always going to get their act together ...			0
now we need to up our game , ’ mr @entity32 says in an article , right , for today ’s @entity39			0
the mp writes that ‘ continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer ’ , and warns that the party will not win by relying on a ‘ core vote and a few disgruntled @entity49 ’ – which he describes devastatingly as ‘ a suicidal strategy ’			1
his remarks are a thinly veiled attack on the plan advocated by elections supremo @entity55 to aim for a modest 35 per cent share of the vote at next year ’s poll – and hope that the in - built advantage the party receives from the electoral system delivers a @entity63 majority			1
mr @entity32 concludes : ‘ @entity64 is running out and if we do n’t have a strong @entity25 and local elections next week then things need to change ... more of the same wo n’t cut it			1
’ labour candidate @entity68 criticised @entity2 at a £ 100 - a - head party fundraising dinner mr @entity32 ’s fears were echoed by @entity68 , a @entity8 parliamentary candidate in @entity71 and @entity72 – one of the party ’s key target seats – who was recorded making critical remarks about mr @entity2 ’s election strategy			1
‘ the machine is not functioning in any capacity , ’ mr @entity68 was taped saying at a £ 100 - a - ticket @entity8 fundraising event held on tuesday			2
‘ we need to be appealing to the aspirational @entity85 voter			0
the current strategy does n’t ... indicate that we are winning over that type of support			0
’ mr @entity68 – highlighting a party election poster which falsely and embarrassingly suggested the @entity41 had put vat on food , which is exempt – revealed the dismay felt by @entity8 candidates who see their chance of entering the @entity63 at the next election fading			1
‘ i ’m fearful , ’ he said , citing a ‘ dodgy campaign ’ and ‘ no coherent messaging ’ , before adding : ‘ the economy is picking up			0
that reinforces the narrative that they ( the @entity15 ) are doing well , and there ’s absolutely sod all anyone can do about that			0
’ the party ’s meltdown started after two polls at the start of the week gave the @entity41 a rare lead over @entity8 , causing pundits to slash the chances of @entity8 securing a majority ( see below )			2
it coincided with the arrival in the @entity114 of @entity26 , the former @entity115 election guru , who has been hired by mr @entity2 on a reported £ 250,000 contract to turn his fortunes around.the strategist – known as ‘ @entity120 ’ – gave a short speech to the @entity122 , held meetings with key frontbenchers including @entity125 and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques			1
but sources say shadow chancellor @entity130 was the only senior @entity8 frontbencher not to ask a question when mr @entity26 was introduced to the @entity122			1
mr @entity130 has been engaged in a thinly veiled turf war with mr @entity55 , who is credited with persuading the @entity27 elections guru to work for @entity8			2
one source said : ‘ everybody asked @entity26 a question – everybody , that is , except @entity130			2
it was n’t hard to read between the lines			0
’ but @entity39 also understands there was irritation that mr @entity26 – who is not expected to spend much time in the @entity114 – was only able to take questions for just over half an hour			2
one source said : ‘ in the middle of a vital election campaign , the @entity122 were all ordered to be in @entity146 to meet this great figure			0
and yet when @entity2 introduced him , he said , “ @entity26 can only be here for about 40 minutes			1
” that did not go down well			0
’ witnesses said the quietly spoken mr @entity26 – ‘ more @entity151 than @entity152 ’ – then spoke for under five minutes			2
‘ he said there were differences between the @entity27 and @entity114 politics but one thing was common – a sense of alienation among voters from the political process			0
it was all very nice but i ’m not sure what it added to the sum of human knowledge , ’ said the source			0
one senior @entity8 mp warned : ‘ we are staying quiet until thursday ’s results , which have to show progress			0
if we lose seats then we are not on course to win the election , and we will need to speak out			2
@entity2 and @entity172 are becoming as dysfunctional as @entity173 and @entity174 , and @entity172 and @entity55 loathe each other			2
we need a mass shake up ’			0
last night , @entity15 cabinet minister @entity177 came to the @entity179 ’s support , saying he was genuinely an ‘ @entity2 fan ’ and insisting @entity8 had picked the right man			1
communities secretary mr @entity177 also warned his party not to underestimate mr @entity2			1
‘ he is the authentic voice of @entity8 and we have made a series of mistakes collectively because we have always underestimated him , ’ he said			0
@entity68 refused to comment last night .			0
