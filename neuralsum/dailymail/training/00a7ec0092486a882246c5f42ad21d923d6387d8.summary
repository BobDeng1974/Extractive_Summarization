by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:25 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 18:31 est , 28 august 2013 one in six families are ‘ workless ’ , the fewest since records began in 1996 , the @entity2 has said			0
the @entity2 said 17.1 per cent of households have no adults aged 16 to 64 with a job , compared with 19.2 per cent when the @entity9 came to power			1
typically , those in workless houses are either looking for a job but unable to find one , or ‘ inactive ’ , which covers anything from being a housewife to being too ill to work			2
the facts : the number of workless households has dropped to a new low since records began in 1996 bad news : there are still 500,000 people in @entity25 who have never worked for a variety of reasons households which do not have any working age adults are excluded from the figures			1
the fall is an endorsement of work and pensions minister @entity34 ’s welfare reforms , designed to make finding work more attractive			2
@entity36 , the employment minister , said helping people off benefits is ‘ one of this government ’s top priorities ’			0
he said : ‘ by reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits , and through schemes such as the @entity48 and @entity49 , we are giving people the support they need to get a job			2
’ since 2010 , the number of workless households has dropped by around 427,000 to 3.5million			0
one in seven children , around 1.6million , live in a workless home the majority – 65 per cent – have a single parent			0
picture of @entity25 : @entity2 figures reveal how many hosueholds are in work , partially in work or not in work at all in the @entity25 the graph shows the percentage of workless households by region in the three months to june 2013 the graph shows people in workless households by age group in the three months to june 2013 there remain huge regional variations in worklessness , with 23 per cent of households workless in the @entity73 , compared with 13 per cent in the @entity74 and 14 per cent in the @entity73			1
the @entity2 figures also show the number of households where no one has ever had a job is @entity78 are 297,000 households ‘ in which no adult has ever worked ’ , down 43,000 in a year			0
the @entity2 said the sharp fall in workless households over the last year , down by 182,000 , was partly due to our ageing society			0
one - person workless households with adults aged 50 to 64 saw the ‘ greatest fall ’ , but the number of such households with adults aged 65 and over grew			1
the report said this ‘ is partly due to some workless households moving from the 16 to 64 age group to the 65 and over group ’			1
so - called workless households stood at 17.1 per cent in the three months to june , down from 17.9 per cent a year ago and 19.2 cent in the same period in 2010			1
the number of households where no one has ever worked stands at 297,000 , down by 43,000 over the past year .			0
