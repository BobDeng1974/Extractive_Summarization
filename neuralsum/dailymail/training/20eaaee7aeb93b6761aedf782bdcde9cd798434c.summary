by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 15:33 est , 16 january 2013 aliens : @entity3 is fast - approaching , so @entity4 caught up with @entity5 , senior producer for the game , to see what fans can expect			1
tell us about the game ? what is the story and what can we expect ? @entity13 : @entity3 is the canonical video game sequel of the @entity2 films which that takes place 17 weeks after the events of @entity2			1
' the @entity2 are investigating a distress signal that was sent out from the @entity20 , the original ship from the film which was reported missing between the events of @entity2 and @entity23			1
they 're coming through the ceiling ! aliens will work in packs to try and take down your team ' they find it in orbit over @entity2 , the last place it should be since it ’s the very planet that it was supposed to have left at the end of @entity2			1
something horrible is on that ship			2
' the game starts here with corporal @entity40 , one the last marines woken from hypersleep , boarding the @entity20 to find out what happened on the ship as well as what happened to the marines who had boarded the ship prior to him			2
' at this point , all hell breaks loose and the player is faced with all the horrors and action seen in the @entity2 films with some new twists			1
' it ’s obviously a first - person shooter , but have you incorporated many set - pieces ? are there any vehicles to drive ? @entity13 : ' the @entity2 universe is very rich with amazing sets , vehicles , weapons , and more			1
when we started working on @entity64 we talked about what would be the most exciting things to include from the universe and got to work			2
' when you play the game you will fight through the iconic areas seen in aliens such as the @entity20 , @entity2 , the surface of @entity2 , the iconic @entity73 , and more , as wells as explore parts of these locations you never got to see in the films			1
' one of the designers we worked with who worked on the original aliens , @entity82 , helped us take the original set designs of the film and expand them out			1
' when you start working on and @entity2 game , and you want to do it right , you have to talk with the people who started it all ! ' as far as vehicles go , you ’ll have to play the game to see			1
you ’ll be pleasantly surprised			1
' new faces : @entity91 have developed the new breeds of @entity93 carefully as to not jar with the universe what is your favourite moment from @entity2 ? have you tried to incorporate this into the game ? @entity13 : ' i have a lot of favorite moments			1
mine has to be when the marines are in @entity107 ’s @entity106 ’s operations setting up the defenses and the power gets cut by the @entity110			2
the suspense , horror and action of that scene is amazing			2
these three things pretty much sum up @entity64			0
aliens boasted some strong female characters			0
will we see this in @entity3 ? @entity13 : ' most certainly			0
one of the characters in the player ’s squad , @entity123 , is a pivotal character in the story of @entity64			0
i do n’t want to spoil too much , but when the player finds her , she is terminal			0
where that goes from there and how she handles it is very much keeping with the strong female characters of the @entity2 universe			2
there are new aliens on show in the game			0
what steps did you take to ensure fans of the films were happy with the designs ? @entity13 : ' @entity64 does feature some new @entity110 that we have n’t seen before in the @entity2 universe			2
since @entity64 is canonical , we had to be very careful with how we handled that			0
' fans have always been very interested in knowing how @entity148 work and how ours fit into the whole scheme of things			0
when we were creating them we stuck with @entity153 ’s view on the @entity2 species , which is that of a hive hierarchy			1
short , controlled bursts : the @entity158 is effective at most ranges , but accuracy is affected if you simply hold down the trigger ' in aliens we saw the @entity164 , soldiers , praetorians , and in @entity167 we saw what we call a scout			0
these are the @entity110 we started with			0
' so when gameplay dictated the need for a new type of combat challenge for the player , we designed the new @entity110 with the hive hierarchy in mind			1
' when we look at ant hives , bee hives , or termite nests , they have a lot more roles than just these			0
looking at nature , you realize how scary it can be , so we started there			0
' when players play the game , they will learn how our @entity110 fit into this hive , but we do n’t want to give away all the secrets of the @entity2 universe			1
we have to leave some things a mystery			0
' follow us on @entity196 : @ @entity197 and on @entity198 : @entity199 .			0

takes place 17 weeks after the events of the @entity2 film
