@entity1 's withdrawal from the historic @entity2 has further worsened relations between the @entity4 and the other home nations			1
officials in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 were unhappy to find out about the @entity4 ditching a tournament that started in 1925 via a letter from chairman @entity12 , with no warning or consultation			1
this is seen as another example of @entity4 ‘ arrogance ’ following the @entity18 telling @entity19 that they want to send @entity21 football teams to the @entity22 without informing the other countries , who put the kybosh on the initiative			2
@entity1 's @entity27 ( right ) puts pressure on @entity7 's @entity29 during the 2014 @entity2 @entity1 's withdrawal from the event , as told by @entity4 chairman @entity12 ( left ) , left the home nations fuming and @entity1 ’s desire to have more varied opposition for their under 16 players is not going down well in @entity8 , the current holders of the @entity2			1
the @entity4 say they have kept the tournament organisers in the loop and only revised their plans after @entity40 cut their title sponsorship - which the tv station dispute - and wanted changes to the format			1
the remaining @entity2 competitors are planning to invite another country from @entity47 to replace @entity1			1
meanwhile , there was some surprise that @entity12 chose to go to the @entity50 under 21 cup final between @entity52 and @entity53 last monday rather than the @entity55 final first leg between @entity56 and @entity57 at the @entity59 academy			0
the @entity4 say @entity12 had business on the south coast			2
champion jockey and @entity64 fan @entity62 , who retires from riding at @entity65 on saturday , will be feted at the @entity66 when his schedule next allows him to watch the @entity68			1
@entity64 fan @entity62 , who retires from a remarkable career on saturday , will be honoured at the @entity66 @entity70 might be struggling physically with his knees at the age of 74			1
but he ’s certainly showing more clarity with his opinions on the game than he infamously did in the 2002 @entity76 , when he picked @entity77 as player of the tournament			0
@entity70 , who was promoting an art exhibition inspired by his life at @entity83 ’s @entity82 , made pertinent comments about @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
and about @entity92 ’s 7 - 1 thrashing by @entity93 in the @entity76 semi-final , @entity70 said : ‘ one - nil or two - nil — but seven goals was a disaster			2
only @entity97 knows what happened			0
’ @entity70 , who 's the subject of an exhibition at a @entity83 gallery , says ' @entity97 only knows ' what happened to @entity92 when they were thrashed 7 - 1 by @entity93 in the semi-final of their home @entity76 last year the @entity107 are running out of time to clinch a terrestrial highlights deal for the @entity110 , which is considered hugely important for growing the game			1
talks with @entity113 have stalled and the competition starts on may 15			0
there are no highlights clauses in @entity40 ’s exclusive deal and the rights holders would have to agree when the highlights were shown - adding to the complications the @entity107 is racing against the clock to clinch a terrestrial highlights deal for the soon - to - commence @entity110 @entity124 ’s high horse @entity126 silver medallist @entity125 and his supporters tweeted furiously that your @entity124 columnist knows nothing about gymnastics - fair point - after revealing upset in the sport about celebrity @entity125 being picked for the @entity133 ahead of multi-discipline gymnasts when he competes only on the pommel horse			1
however the @entity137 ’s gymnastics expert @entity136 , who certainly is qualified to offer an opinion , said of @entity125 : ‘ to justify his place on the team he needs another piece of apparatus			0
’ @entity137 gymnastics expert @entity136 said @entity125 ( pictured ) needs to compete in more than the pommel horse to justify his place in the @entity21 team for the @entity133 @entity146 ’s pledge to cut ticket prices for their @entity149 move has upset clubs who regard the move as cynical , given the @entity146 ’ favourable tenancy deal in @entity154			0
spurs , who missed out on the venue , are particularly critical but there are other @entity50 sides who blame @entity161 for not negotiating a better deal with @entity146			0
@entity146 ’s pledge to cut ticket prices for their @entity149 ( pictured ) move has upset other clubs @entity166 , @entity9 ’s genial @entity167 vice-president on @entity19 ’s executive , has nevertheless upset the @entity4 just a month before he stands down			2
the ever - helpful @entity166 described the decision - reversed on appeal on thursday night - to ban @entity172 defender @entity171 from the @entity174 final after a handball was missed by officials in the semi-final against @entity178 as a ‘ ludicrous injustice ’ that @entity19 could overturn			0
the @entity4 say they acted entirely by their rulebook			2
@entity167 vice-president on @entity19 ’s executive @entity166 called @entity171 ' retrospective suspension from the @entity174 final after a missed handball a ‘ ludicrous injustice ’ - it was overturned on thursday			0
