by @entity0 two best friends in their 40s , who look young and healthy , want to take their own lives after hearing a talk from a controversial euthanasia physician - even though their own doctors are against it			2
@entity9 , 44 , and @entity10 , 43 , from @entity11 , have said that they can not go on with their non-life threatening diseases so are turning to assisted suicide			1
@entity9 , a mother of one , suffered serious complications from anti-obesity surgery and can now only consume liquids and soft foods			1
@entity10 , right , and @entity20 , are two friends who want euthanasia , pose in @entity23 , @entity11 she has to have regular blood transfusions because she has anaemia and also has an agonising herniated disc in her back			1
in 2011 miss @entity10 was diagnosed with @entity28 which leaves her exhausted for months on end			1
she wants to end her life before it gets much worse			2
when both women spoke to their own doctors about assisted suicide , they were told not to do it			2
miss @entity9 was told to wait a few years and to see what happened with her condition , and not to give up hope on medical advances in their lifetime			1
miss @entity10 told the @entity41 that her doctor said : ‘ no , you ’re too young ’			1
but they see an early death as the ‘ @entity46 ’ even though it will mean miss @entity9 makes an orphan of her son , 17			1
the pair were inspired by @entity11 doctor and right - to - die activist @entity50 , who critics claim has a ‘ license to kill anyone ’ and issues ‘ death on demand ’			2
@entity20 ( pictured left and right ) suffered serious complications from anti-obesity surgery and can now only consume liquids and soft foods the cancer specialist has already courted controversy for ending the life of a man who went through a botched sex change operation to become a woman			1
should miss @entity9 and @entity70 follow through on their promise , it will likely reignite the debate in their native @entity11 - though it will horrify many in @entity76 where euthanasia is only legal in four states and millions bitterly opposing it			1
the two friends known each other for 20 years during which time @entity83 and @entity70 have shared jobs , holidays , endless phone calls and thousands of happy memories			2
both women have elderly parents and only miss @entity9 has a child - she wants to wait until her son has finished college before taking her own life			1
describing her frustration with her condition , miss @entity9 said : ‘ i ’m fed up with the food			1
‘ i want meat and fish			0
i do n’t want to be an old lady unable to drink a glass of champagne or eat a good meal			0
’ view of the exterior of a building in @entity106 , @entity107 , which houses the assisted suicide clinic - where assisted suicide is also legal miss @entity10 said : ‘ i try to enjoy life			1
some days it works , some days it does n't			0
but if i do n't want to do it any more , i stop			0
i pull out the plug			0
' the two friends are apparently committed to ending their lives and have downloaded the forms and spoken to an organisation which can assist them			0
they admit that some people react as if they are crazy - but that wo n’t stop them			0
miss @entity9 said : ‘ they say , ' what are you talking about ? there are people who are much worse			1
‘ but people do n't feel my pain and suffering			0
’ she added that for her death will be ‘ like a light at the end of a tunnel ’			0
she said : ‘ you know that when the point comes that you can not take it any more , you do n't think , ' my @entity134 , how am i going to be here in pain ? ' if you want to get out , it can stop			0
’ euthanasia is legal in @entity11 but only so long as the patient is in a ‘ futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that can not be alleviated ’			1
lawmakers recently amended it to go even further and allow children and @entity145 ’s sufferers to be euthanised			0
children will only be covered if they are ‘ capable of discernment or affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we can not alleviate ’			0
among the patients that @entity50 has helped kill themselves was @entity11 @entity150 , 44 , who was born a woman called @entity10			2
he died of a lethal injection after requesting assisted suicide due to the ‘ unbearable psychological suffering ’ of his botcher operation which left him looking like a ‘ monster ’			0
@entity50 opened the @entity159 clinic with colleagues two years ago to help those seeking euthanasia - the name is a pun on the @entity165 word for ultimate , meaning final			2
according to reports in the @entity11 media , his team of doctors killed 33 patients in the last year , the first year of the clinic ’s operation .			0

@entity10 , 43 , suffered serious complication from anti-obesity surgery and can now only consume liquids
@entity9 was diagnosed with @entity28 in 2011
