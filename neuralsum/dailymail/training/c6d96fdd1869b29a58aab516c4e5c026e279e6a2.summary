leaked emails have added further weight to claims three @entity4 schools knew about visits by @entity7 inspectors days , and even weeks in advance			1
the academies involved - @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 - are all linked to dame @entity14			0
ms @entity14 was principal at the @entity11 school and is the chief executive of the @entity17 which runs the academies in @entity19 and @entity13			0
leaked emails have added further weight to claims three @entity4 schools knew about visits by @entity7 inspectors days , and even weeks in advance - the schools were linked to dame @entity24 by law , schools can only be given half a day 's notice of an inspection , but in august it was claimed the schools knew days , sometimes even weeks , before inspectors were due to visit			1
at the time ms @entity14 had moved from being the headteacher at @entity10 school to the trust			0
she had also been made a dame for services to education and was a part - time @entity7 inspector			2
sir @entity37 , national director for quality and inspection training at @entity7 , looked into the tip - off claims and concluded the schools could merely have guessed the dates of inspections			1
but leaked emails seen by @entity45 show ms @entity14 saw an inspection schedule for one of the schools and was in a position to discuss the timing of visits with @entity7			1
in a group email sent more than three weeks before inspectors visited @entity10 on may 14 and 15 , 2013 , ms @entity14 wrote : ' only three weeks or so till @entity7 due at @entity10 too ! let 's keep focused			2
' ms @entity14 was principal of the @entity10 and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by @entity7 , and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated the @entity60 was also caught up in the tip - up claims investigated by @entity7 according to the emails , ms @entity14 appears to have acted on prior knowledge in the days before a visit to @entity10			1
she had requested that the school 's website be updated - ' inspectors will probably look monday ' , and that their roll of honour be ' sorted ' as it looked ' sparse on the wall '			1
at @entity71 , where ms @entity14 was chair of governors , mr @entity37 's investigation conceded she was ' mistakenly given sight of a schedule ' that included the planned inspection date for the school			2
the information was provided to her during her training to become a @entity7 inspector			0
mr @entity37 said there was no evidence that ms @entity14 had passed the information on			0
the inspection date was then changed , from may 7 and 8 to may 13 and 14 , but the school 's principal , @entity84 , however , turned down an offer from @entity87 to attend a @entity89 function on may 12			2
according to the emails , three weeks before those inspections ms @entity14 informed her secretary : ' 14 and 15th may – please do not add any further appointments – i am expecting a late notice very important event on or around those days			0
' @entity97 was unable to reach ms @entity14 for comment .			0

claims school 's had advanced notice of @entity7 inspections
but an investigation found they could have simply guessed the dates
now leaked emails *reveal* how the schools acted on the possible tip - offs
