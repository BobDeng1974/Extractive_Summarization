there was the same languid stride , opening up to cover the pitch ; the same fiery will to win when he slid , sometimes rashly , into tackles and a muscular core that defied opponents to win the ball off him			0
@entity10 , the £ 60million midfielder , was the man of the match as @entity12 beat @entity13 2 - 0 on monday and for @entity14 , watching in the stands for @entity17 tv , and @entity12 manager @entity19 there must have been some wistful memories			1
for @entity14 they would have been fond recollections of a towering presence in his @entity24 sides and , for @entity19 , of a formidable former midfield partner			0
‘ fortunately for us he is like @entity37 , ’ said the former @entity47 midfielder			1
‘ he is very important for the team dynamic , and we just enjoy playing together with him			0
that unity is the best way for us to progress as far as we can			0
’ and the @entity53 coach , former @entity24 captain and icon of the greatest @entity12 team , indulges the comparison			2
‘ people say he ’s like me — i guess we have similar power in possession and he ’s strong , quite tall , an elegant player , ’ said @entity37			2
‘ but in his head he ’s more attacking than i ever was			0
i would win more balls but he ’s more technical			0
he ’ll become one of the best in the world			0
’ full flow : @entity10 powers past @entity69 during @entity12 's last - 16 victory at @entity71 technique : the midfielder forced @entity74 into making a fine stop from this well - struck volley mentor : @entity40 winner and current @entity12 boss @entity19 congratulates @entity10 at full - time @entity80 : march 15 , 1993 age : 21 height : 6ft 1in weight : 12st 8lb @entity84 : midfield club : @entity86 past clubs : @entity88 ( 2007 - 09 ) , @entity89 ( 2009 - 2012 ) @entity90 / goals : 96/14 @entity92 / goals : 15/3 salary : approx £ 20,000 p / w @entity42 may be playing with him a little more regularly next season			1
even though @entity10 looks like a player made for the physicality of the @entity99 , just as @entity37 was , @entity96 are embarking on a project to bring home the exiles of @entity17 football , especially the @entity104			1
and for the man born in @entity107 , a suburb to the east of the city , @entity105 seems to be his destination of choice after @entity89 let him slip through the net two years ago when they objected to the demands of @entity113 , his agent			1
@entity115 would have done all he could to bring @entity10 back to @entity116 this summer had the manager stayed in place but @entity120 sides accept that if @entity86 let him leave , it looks impossible to stop a @entity105 return			1
@entity10 retains excellent @entity120 from his two years in the @entity123			1
‘ why should we be afraid of anyone ? ’ he said in reply to a question from a @entity127 journalist in defiant @entity120			0
‘ we ’re the @entity12 national team ! ’ graceful : @entity10 controls the ball brilliantly during @entity86 ' @entity132 clash against @entity133 formidable : at @entity86 , @entity134 and @entity10 have formed an exceptional central - midfield partnership @entity136 staying put @entity138 6ft 1in @entity10 is three inches shorter than @entity37 but still stands out in central midfield			1
unlike many tall players , who do n’t need to try to win headers , he has good spring and a well - timed leap , as demonstrated for the opening goal against @entity144 rates him a much better technical player than he was , though the former @entity24 man had a decent pass on him too			1
nevertheless , an in - form @entity10 has that rare ability to dictate a game with the quality of his @entity151 in the @entity152 is formidable — just ask @entity13 ’s @entity69 , who was targeted early in monday ’s match			1
as that challenge showed though , @entity10 can be indiscriminate and so he risks being sent off if he ca n’t rein in his natural @entity155 is n’t slow , but he is more of a 400m runner than an out - and - out sprinter			1
once his long legs open up their stride , he can chase down most players			0
as such , he is the ideal ‘ box - to - box ’ @entity161 of powerthe comparison with @entity37 bears up best when you consider his body strength			1
his physicality is his prime attribute and it ’s near enough impossible to get the ball off him if he is focused on his @entity170 ’s young so it will take time to develop			0
decision - making in the final ball could improve			0
‘ he likes running for the ball , ’ said one scout			0
' not sure how much he likes running to get it back			0
’ that determined attitude led to his falling out with sir @entity177 at @entity47			0
at the time , in 2012 , @entity177 and the then chief executive @entity178 would not buckle when faced with the wage demands of @entity10 and @entity113			2
the fact that the player was friendly with @entity182 and enjoyed hanging out with the @entity53 striker at the @entity185 restaurant in the city is also unlikely to have endeared him to @entity177			0
part of @entity10 ’s argument was he expected first - team football ; he made just seven appearances for the club , but was only 18			1
@entity47 refused to back down , and @entity10 left for @entity86			1
with hindsight , it looks like the equivalent of winning a battle but losing the war : the @entity17 certainly looks a perfect fit for @entity47 ’s midfield now			0
that said , at 21 he remains raw and his decision - making with the final pass at times against @entity13 was awry			1
‘ he is still young and he has a lot of things to learn , ’ said @entity203 , the @entity204 goalkeeper and @entity12 captain			2
‘ but that kind of game can help him to get more confidence because to score and be decisive in the last 16 of a @entity40 is a big thing			1
’ let go : @entity10 in action for @entity47 's youth team in an @entity214 semi-final versus @entity216 stalled : but the @entity17 was given few first - team opportunities at @entity116 by sir @entity177 @entity19 was under pressure to drop @entity10 for @entity219 , as his displays had not been what @entity12 hoped for and expected			1
‘ he kept his confidence even though he has been getting a lot of criticism , ’ said @entity42			0
he knows the team is with him			0
against @entity13 he showed what he can do and it is the best way to give a response to those who criticise			2
’ he certainly demonstrated his physical prowess — at times too well			0
his early tackle on @entity69 infuriated @entity13 coach @entity231			2
@entity19 had stressed to @entity232 and @entity10 that they would have to match the strength of the @entity235 in midfield			2
they seemed to take the message a step too far , with @entity69 taken off with a serious ankle injury after one @entity232 challenge			0
specimen : @entity10 is tall , muscular and quick on the ball , making him a nightmare for his opponents powerful : @entity10 has emerged as one of the most complete midfielders in @entity247 during his time in @entity249 what could have been : @entity47 let @entity10 leave and now he has become a star for club and country @entity136 can replace @entity255 - @entity254 and though @entity10 rose well to score his header and hit an excellent first - half volley , @entity12 ’s win had as much to do with @entity260 ’s steady work and the introduction of @entity262			1
nevertheless , there is a feeling among the @entity17 that the goal and accolades that followed will allow @entity10 to fulfil the role prepared for him			1
‘ it was one of the biggest evenings of my career but the victory is more important than the goal , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ it ’s liberating for the team			0
i play for the team , for @entity12			2
’ ‘ history is repeating itself ’ was the front - page headline of @entity12 ’s sports daily @entity278 yesterday and they dared to reference those great teams of 1998 and 2006			2
after all they have @entity19 , who lifted the @entity40 in 98 , and perhaps they have @entity37 ’s replacement			1
so , as @entity10 says , why should they fear the @entity127 ?			2

@entity10 's superb *performances* over the last couple of years have led to comparisons being drawn between him and @entity37
he scored first goal in @entity12 's 2 - 0 win over @entity13 in the last 16
the midfielder has flourished at @entity86 after leaving @entity89
has been one of @entity12 most *impressive* players at the @entity40
