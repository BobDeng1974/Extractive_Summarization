by @entity0 , @entity1 by @entity0 , @entity2 will head into the @entity3 buoyed by his first ever successful title defence following a dramatic final round of the @entity6			1
@entity7 overturned an eight - shot deficit thanks to a brilliant closing 67 despite the wet and windy conditions at @entity9 , although he also had plenty of help from @entity13 @entity12			1
@entity12 's four - shot overnight lead disappeared with a front nine of 41 , but he battled back well with birdies on the 14th and 16th to pull within one of @entity7 , who had moved three ahead with his fifth birdie of the day on the 16th			1
champion : northern irishman @entity7 successfully defended the @entity6 title comeback : @entity7 successfully overturned an eight - shot overnight deficit to win with @entity7 then dropping his only shot of the day on the 18th after finding heavy rough off the tee , @entity12 needed to par the 18th to force a play - off but missed from two feet just as @entity7 left the recording area to prepare for extra holes			1
@entity12 's closing 76 left him in a tie for second with @entity34 's @entity33 , who dropped five shots in the first four holes but played the remainder in four under for a 72			2
' i 'm very surprised , ' @entity7 said after claiming his 10th @entity40 title			1
' @entity41 through my second glass of red wine last night , when i was very disappointed with my back - nine performance on saturday , i really did n't think i 'd be a ) standing here with an opportunity to be in a play - off and b ) with a trophy in my hands			1
' i feel very fortunate			0
@entity12 is a great , great player			2
i literally gave him that putt on the last green			0
i did n't expect him to miss that			0
' it 's not really the way you like to win			0
i was ready to go for the play - off , but i 'll take it and run			1
i really needed this victory			0
it 's a special one for me			0
there 's a busy summer ahead and this a really good kick - start to the summer			0
' form : @entity7 will hope he can convert his win at @entity9 into @entity3 glory sweet taste of victory : @entity7 sprays champagne on course officials after winning the @entity70 @entity7 has deliberately played a lighter schedule this year - even missing the @entity72 at @entity73 - to leave himself fresher for the second half of the season			1
' it 's a good decision now , but i have to say myself and my team were starting to question it , ' the former @entity77 champion added on @entity82 4			0
' but my body has probably never been in as good a shape at this point in the season coming into two major championships , the @entity89 play - offs and hopefully the @entity90			1
' i 'm very proud to defend my first title ever and this is the boost i needed on many fronts , especially the @entity90 ( the win takes him 10th on the @entity96 )			2
' @entity7 , who held the outright lead after the first round of the @entity70 the last time it was held at @entity99 in 2006 , added : ' i was at @entity99 a couple of weeks ago			1
' i think it 's my type of set - up			0
you really have to find fairways off the tee and there are big flat greens where you can hole some putts			0
this is a nice confidence booster and i will be back at @entity99 next sunday ready to go			0
' implosion : @entity13 @entity12 crumbled on the final day and blew an eight - shot overnight lead poor : @entity12 recovered on the back nine but he missed a short par putt to force a play - off @entity12 found himself five clear of the field when playing partner @entity33 got off to a terrible start and local favourite @entity117 followed a birdie on the first with a double bogey on the second			1
but the 34 - year - old then missed from 18 inches for par on the fourth and four feet on the sixth , before running up a double - bogey six on the next where his ball was only found in the deep rough because an on - course television commentator stood on it			2
@entity12 was allowed a free drop but could only hack the ball a few yards sideways and eventually did well to get up and down from short of the green for a six			2
a poor chip from left of the eighth green led to another bogey and two more early in the back nine looked to have ended his chances as @entity7 picked up shots on the 13th , 14th and 16th			0
success : it is the first time that @entity7 has defended a @entity40 title			2

@entity7 recorded his first ever successful defence of a title
the @entity147 closed with a 67 to win at @entity9
@entity13 @entity12 blew a four - shot overnight lead
@entity151 missed a par putt on the 18th which would have forced play - off
@entity3 begins on july 17 at @entity156
