@entity0 made light of the uncertainty surrounding his future as manager of @entity5 by beckoning a fan from the crowd and allowing them to sit in his seat on the bench			1
@entity0 , who faces the axe despite leading @entity5 to a sixth - placed finish and qualifying for the @entity14 , also gave the supporter his infamous gilet jacket to wear			1
@entity5 won 3 - 0 against @entity17 at @entity18 thanks to first - half goals from @entity20 , @entity21 and an own goal from @entity23			1
you talking to me : @entity0 calls a @entity5 fan from the crowd during the win against @entity17 come join us : @entity0 cheekily beckons the fan while the game is still going on but it could be @entity0 's final game in charge of the club with @entity36 coach @entity35 and @entity38 manager @entity37 heavily linked to the post			1
in his final programme notes of the season @entity40 chose not to acknowledge @entity0 at all , instead choosing to criticise the club 's playing style even when they have won			1
he wrote : ' the new signings in the summer had the effect of raising expectations and we all started the season with high hopes , yet the players undoubtedly needed time to adapt to a new league			1
we were also forced to make managerial changes , which is far from ideal mid-season			2
' our sense of falling short , felt by all , including the players , is based on some poor performances during the season and knowing we have not performed at the level we know we could have done			1
' even in games where we gained maximum points , our football was not always what we have come to expect and associate with our club			2
' here you go : @entity66 then presents the startled fan with his @entity5 gilet on borrowed time : reports suggest @entity0 could be on his way out of @entity5 this summer during the second - half of the win against @entity17 , with @entity5 cruising to victory against their out - of - form opponents , @entity0 summoned a supporter , @entity76 , from the crowd with a smile before presenting him with his club - branded gilet jacket which has become a feature of his time on the club 's bench			1
as if that was n't bizarre enough , @entity0 then urged @entity76 to sit alongside his assistants @entity87 and @entity88 as open - mouthed players looked on in disbelief			1
the supporter accepted the invitation before returning to his usual seat close to dugout soon after			2
in his post-match press conference @entity0 revealed that @entity76 is a regular at @entity18 who gives him pointers on where he is going wrong			1
he said : ' that guy 's an expert , seriously			2
every week he tells me what to do			2
so i gave him the opportunity to do the job			2
he bottled it at first but then he swallowed it			0
it was just good banter			0
' there were a couple i could have picked			0
we 've got the police looking for him because he 's nicked the gilet			0
but it 's fine , he can have it			0
' on whether or not he has the backing of other @entity5 supporters , @entity0 added : ' everyone i speak to is quite genuine and gives me a lot of appreciation , to be honest			1
' have a seat : @entity66 offers the fan to sit alongside his assistants @entity87 and @entity88 lucky day : the fan ca n't believe his good fortune , while @entity87 looks amused at the situation @entity76 spoke to @entity125 after the game to discuss his experience and claim @entity5 's treatment of @entity0 has not been very good			1
he said : ' it was a great bit of humour and something i wo n't forget			0
' to be fair to him he 's not fighting with the fans			0
he 's always happy to chat and have a laugh with us			0
i called a couple of subs he should make and it just so happened he made them			0
' we were 3 - 0 up at the time and i thought it would be a good chance to bring some youngsters on and he said " you know what , why do n't you come and have a go "			2
i did n't know what to make of it , or if i would get in trouble for going over the barrier			0
' i 'm a lifelong @entity5 fan so i 'm not going to turn down the chance to sit in the hotseat			1
as i was walking away he said " you can keep the jacket " and he shook my hand and patted me on the back			0
' i do n't think he has been treated particularly fairly by the club and sections of the fans			0
no one in his position would have turned the job down and he has done the best he can do			0
' performances have been more exciting than under the previous manager			0
but he 's a bit of a wideboy and maybe he has just rubbed people up the wrong way			0
' laughing matter : when asked about the situation afterwards @entity0 claimed it was just banter easy win : it was an equally happy day on the pitch as @entity5 cruised past @entity17 to seal sixth spot			1

first - half goals seal @entity5 victory against @entity17
@entity0 lightens the mood by beckoning fan from crowd
