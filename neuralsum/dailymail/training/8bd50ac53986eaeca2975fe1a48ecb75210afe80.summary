touch me : this second image , from the same @entity10 source , purports to show the front of the ipad mini 2 , where it is equipped with the same @entity42 fingerprint sensor as the @entity19 firms latest mobile phones during the @entity65 announcement on 10 september , @entity15 's ceo @entity63 said : ' our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware , software and services that we ca n’t wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014			1

@entity15 is rumoured to gearing up to launch an @entity6 5 and an ipad mini 2 , on 15 october			1
the latest leaked images from technology site @entity82 , allegedly show the rear shell of the @entity6 5 , pictured , with brightly coloured cases it 's likely the ipad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9 - inch screen and not drop to 7 - inches , in a bid to stay slightly bigger than @entity91 's @entity90 and @entity93 's new @entity92			1
if @entity15 adds the @entity96 seen on its new iphones and larger @entity20 , its possible the second - generation ipad mini will be heavier and thicker			0
however , leaked photos of casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting @entity15 will wait to add the high - definition display to later models			2
according to @entity15 site , @entity103 , the rumoured @entity6 will also keep the 9.7 - inch , high - resolution screen seen on older models			0
