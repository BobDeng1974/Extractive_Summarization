it 's every chocoholic 's dream come true - a mountain of @entity5 eggs covering the entire house			1
but while @entity7 - pictured among the treats - does have two chocolate - loving daughters , this incredible bounty is not for them			1
@entity11 , 10 , and @entity12 , five , lost their eight - year - old brother @entity13 last year to a mystery illness , and when @entity5 approached they decided to donate all their eggs to the patients at @entity19 where he was cared for			1
@entity7 - pictured among the treats - has two chocolate - loving daughters but this incredible bounty is not for them			1
instead the eggs will be donated to @entity19 once the family , from @entity23 , @entity24 , posted on @entity25 , kind strangers began to send eggs - and now there are more than 1,000			1
some donations have come from as far afield as the @entity29 , with many from @entity31 and @entity32 and the length and breadth of @entity35			0
the girls came up with the inspirational idea after spending three easters in a row by @entity13 's side at the hospital where they were all lucky enough to receive @entity42			2
@entity11 said : ' i thought it was going to be never - ending ! it feels really nice to remember him and i do n't think the hospital were expecting as many			1
@entity47 , 10 , and @entity48 ( both above with mother @entity50 ) , five , came up with the idea in memory of their brother @entity13 ' it feels a bit strange at the moment			1
i 've never had this much chocolate in my house before			0
' their 29 - year - old mother , who was a full - time carer for @entity13 and now works as a support worker for disabled children , said : ' i was taken aback by it all			0
we did n't expect to get the response that we did			0
it 's really touching what the girls are doing			0
' they were really close to @entity13 , they had a really tight bond			0
the hospital think it 's amazing and a really nice thing to do			2
' on the second day i thought 72 eggs was an amazing response but when it continued the girls were a bit overwhelmed by it all and a bit speechless			2
the eggs are still arriving			0
it feels really good to be able to give something back			0
