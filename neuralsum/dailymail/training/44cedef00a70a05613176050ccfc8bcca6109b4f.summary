an @entity1 villager who risked everything to save the life of a @entity4 is seeking asylum in the @entity6 after his life came under threat in his home country			1
@entity10 could have left heavily injured @entity11 to die in the mountains , but instead took him to his village and protected him from the @entity14			0
in the extraordinary story depicted in the movie ' @entity17 ' , @entity11 was the only one of four @entity4 to survive a nightmarish firefight in northeastern @entity1 in june 2005			1
gravely wounded , he was protected by @entity21 until his rescue by @entity6 forces when @entity10 found @entity11 he had been shot twice , suffered several cracked vertebrae and had shrapnel wounds to his leg			1
speaking through a translator to @entity29 's ' @entity28 ' in 2013 , @entity10 said : ' i knew i had to help him ; to do the right thing , because he was in a lot of danger			0
' ' he very well could have just left me laying there on the side of that waterfall and let me die , ' @entity11 said			0
' but he did n't			0
' @entity11 , pictured third from right , was operating in @entity1 supporting @entity37 , when the rest of his team ( pictured with him ) were killed in a firefight with the @entity14 in june 2005 @entity11 was rescued by @entity6 forces and came home to the @entity6 , back to his native @entity43			1
now @entity10 needs help from the @entity6 after his crucial role in @entity11 's survival , @entity10 and his family had to go into hiding as they received death threats from the @entity14 , their house was burned down , and his cousin was killed			2
these threats had worsened after the release of the movie ' @entity17 ' depicting the events surrounding @entity10 's heroism and @entity11 's dramatic survival			2
once audiences in @entity1 had seen the movie and understood the role @entity10 had played , it became dangerous for him to stay in the same place for longer than a night			0
@entity64 ( second from left ) played @entity11 in the 2013 movie ' @entity17 '			1
once it had been seen in @entity1 , threats against @entity10 's life intensified as his role in @entity11 's survival became more widely known last saturday , with the help of the @entity6 , he managed to escape @entity1 with family members to a neutral , undisclosed , third country			1
he is now working with @entity75 immigration attorney @entity74 to gain refugee status to enter the @entity6 – the first step towards being granted asylum , @entity29 reports			1
@entity74 is working on the exceptionally complicated case on a pro bono basis			0
@entity21 ( left ) attended the ' @entity17 ' @entity75 premiere in december 2013			1
immigration lawyer @entity74 ( right ) has said that if he had applied for asylum then he probably could have stayed in the @entity6 much of the complexity comes from the number of agencies involved , from the @entity86 to the @entity87 – and ultimately it is the latter that will make the decision			2
ironically , the process could have been made much simpler			0
@entity10 has been to the @entity6 before , occasionally visiting @entity11 on his ranch in @entity43 , and attending the movie 's premiere in @entity75 in december 2013			2
@entity74 said @entity10 probably could have stayed had he applied for asylum on one of those visits			0
despite a language barrier between the two of them , @entity11 and @entity10 have become friends and have even gone shooting together on the @entity43 ranch			0
@entity10 ( left ) pictured on a december 2013 visit to @entity11 's ( right ) @entity43 ranch where the two have enjoyed going shooting together			2

@entity21 and some family members left @entity1 on saturday for an undisclosed , neutral , third country
