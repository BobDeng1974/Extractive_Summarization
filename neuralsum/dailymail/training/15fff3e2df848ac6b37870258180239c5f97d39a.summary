by @entity0 published : 20:32 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 20:32 est , 9 august 2013 criticism : health minister @entity2 has spoken out against the ' no cuddling ' policies which are in place at many nurseries a minister last night called on nurseries to scrap controversial kiss and cuddle bans imposed to protect them from abuse allegations - saying they were putting children 's development at risk			1
dr @entity2 , the children 's health minister , demanded nurseries review ' heavy - handed and draconian ' policies which mean thousands of toddlers are spending whole days in childcare without any comfort from staff			1
he said it was ' extraordinary and alarming ' that staff are threatened with the sack for attempting to comfort children distraught because they are missing their parents or because they have grazed their knee			2
the minister , who also works as a hospital doctor in women 's and children 's health , said such policies were ' damaging to a child 's health , wellbeing , and future life chances '			1
the @entity38 revealed earlier this week that an increasing number of nurseries were imposing bans on staff kissing children in the wake of the conviction of paedophile nursery worker @entity46			2
an investigation has found that others instruct staff not to cuddle toddlers , or let them sit on their laps , for all but the shortest periods - claiming that the simple acts of affection harm the independence of the child			2
but child development experts say the lack of contact threatens the well - being of children			1
they warn that denying young children affection can have a devastating impact on their development , their happiness and their stress levels			0
dr @entity2 called on nurseries who had introduced such policies to urgently review their rules			1
' it is a natural human instinct to comfort a distressed child , to hold out a hand if they fall , to reassure them if they are crying ; physical contact is an important part of that , ' he said			1
' the blanket " no contact " approach being taken by some nurseries is extraordinary and alarming ; there is increasingly strong evidence to suggest that a lack of emotional support and physical reassurance from parents and carers during the early years can be damaging to a child 's health , wellbeing , and future life chances , ' dr @entity2 said			1
he said the fear of abuse accusations had led some nurseries to draw up policies which were now so ' draconian and heavy - handed ' that children were being denied basic care			1
' of course it is right for nurseries to properly vet the backgrounds of all staff looking after children , but comforting a child that has hurt itself is part and parcel of good childcare , ' he said			2
development : contact between children and their carers is important for their well - being ( picture posed by models ) the findings of the investigation by daynurseries.co.uk , an online directory of nursery schools , reopened the debate about whether nurseries are the best place to bring up children			1
@entity126 , president of the @entity127 , said : ' it is actually the duty of anyone working with young children to offer physical contact			1
' @entity133 children who are not with their parents are likely to produce a stress hormone known as cortisol			0
having access to a hug or even holding a hand of a key person can help to reduce anxiety			0
' policies that are draconian in terms of not allowing children to be reassured are not fit for purpose as they ignore children 's right to being nurtured			2
' the policy of @entity150 in @entity151 says : ' children are encouraged to be independent ; therefore prolonged periods of cuddling and sitting on practitioners ' laps is discouraged			0
kissing children is forbidden and may result in a disciplinary			0
' in @entity161 , @entity158 , @entity160 's policy says : ' while some contact is unavoidable ( nappy changing and toilet training ) , there are other activities , often instigated by the children themselves , that we explain is not appropriate			2
' this includes any form of kissing on cheek , forehead or lips when a parent is not present			0
' one nursery manager said : ' i tell my staff not to kiss children and explain the reasons for it , to protect them from any allegations			0
children naturally come to you for a kiss and a cuddle , and we always turn to the side so that they can kiss our cheeks			0
' i do n't even kiss my own daughter while in nursery			0
' during discussions about the issue , one parent said : ' the thought of a small baby in a nursery going all day without a kiss from someone makes me quite sad			0
' @entity199 , managing director of the @entity201 chain , said cuddles were important for young children			0
' all the evidence around attachment theory and the guidance in the @entity208 ' @entity207 supports close physical contact with the youngest children and the importance of contact for all children , ' she said			1
' a good , confident practitioner would know exactly what was appropriate , and less experienced staff need to have good role models			0

dr @entity2 mp criticises hands - off policies at many nurseries
says physical contact between children and carers is essential for well - being
