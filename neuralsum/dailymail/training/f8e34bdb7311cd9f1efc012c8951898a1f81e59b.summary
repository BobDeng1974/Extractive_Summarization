this , it has to be said , did not feel like the dawn of what @entity3 has confidently predicted could be a decade of dominance for @entity6			1
it felt like a pre-season friendly that even managed to undermine the name of the stadium that staged it			0
there was n't much worth seeing at the @entity13 , even if it did end in a draw with a team that finished fifth in the @entity19 last season			0
@entity3 blended a bit of experience with plenty of youth on wednesday night and @entity6 's manager also took the opportunity to look at @entity26 for the first time			1
starting spot : @entity26 ( left ) made his debut for @entity6 after his £ 16m move from @entity31 making his mark : @entity33 made his first appearance for @entity6 in their 1 - 1 draw with @entity37 pellets in a battle : @entity39 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity42 during the 1 - 1 draw crunch : @entity45 tackles @entity6 's @entity46 during the first of the friendly game getting stuck in : @entity6 's @entity49 flies into a challenge with @entity51 @entity52 save : pellets keeper @entity53 denies @entity49 as @entity6 search for an equaliser signed from @entity31 in the summer , the full - back is clearly a player of pedigree despite having few chances to prove it here			1
@entity61 looks like he could be of some value to @entity3 too			2
he might not be a regular starter this season but the 19 - year - old looked like something of a man mountain here in the @entity69			0
in fairness to @entity3 , it is some team he now appears to be building at @entity74			2
once he brings back more of the senior players and adds the quality of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity6 will boast a side capable of challenging for all the major honours this coming campaign			1
the seemingly inevitable return of @entity85 - although just as a player and not a player - coach , club officials insist - will only add to their strength			0
this , however , felt like a nod to the past and a look into the more distant future			0
a run out for some of the kids and what could well be one of the last run outs for @entity101 in a @entity6 shirt if he is to lose his place to @entity80			1
it seems unlikely @entity101 would accept sitting on the bench and is therefore sure to take his considerable talents elsewhere			2
bench boys ( from left ) : @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity109 share a joke as they watch on get closer ! @entity3 vents his frustration at @entity6 's players as they struggle against @entity113 making his point : @entity3 barks instructions to his @entity6 players during their game against @entity113 on wednesday , @entity101 nevertheless proved powerless to stop @entity118 scoring for the hosts in the 54th minute , the long - serving @entity6 goalkeeper diverting the shot against the underside of his crossbar but only after the ball had crossed the line			1
as television replays proved , it was an excellent call by the match officials given the absence of goal line technology			0
@entity6 created few opportunities of their own , their best in the first half probably falling to @entity49			2
the 17 - year - old was left with only @entity135 to beat but hit his shot straight at the keeper			0
but to @entity3 's relief @entity138 did rather better six minutes from time , the quick , powerfully built young @entity140 holding off a couple of strong challenges to win the pursuit of a @entity39 ball before scoring with a coolly taken finish			1
afterwards @entity138 said : ' it was pretty physical because they 've started the season already so we had to work even harder			1
today i think i was good and i got a goal			0
i started near the half time and played a good one - two with @entity153 ( @entity39 ) and it 's a decent finish			1
' @entity101 added : ' to play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but i 've been working hard towards fitness			2
the shoulder is good - if we did n't know that i 'm safe to play i would n't but we made the decision to go ahead			0
' @entity37 pellets : @entity53 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity51 , @entity163 , @entity42 , @entity164 , @entity45 , @entity165 , @entity135 , @entity166			0
@entity6 : @entity101 ; @entity39 , @entity61 , @entity169 , @entity26 ( @entity170 60 ) ; @entity171 ( @entity172 60 ) , @entity173 ( @entity174 81 ) ; @entity175 ( @entity176 85 ) , @entity46 ( @entity138 45 ) , @entity49 ( @entity177 77 ) ; @entity178 ( @entity179 60 )			1
unused substitutes : @entity181 , @entity182			0
@entity184 weighs up @entity6 return			2

@entity187 took the lead in *controversial* *fashion* through @entity168
@entity140 *teenager* @entity138 saved @entity3 's side with a fine finish
@entity3 handed a debut to new £ 16m signing @entity33
@entity6 started with @entity101 , @entity39 and @entity173
