the 39 - degree heat in @entity1 meant @entity2 and @entity3 were given the @entity5 's first official ' cooling break ' , as fans were seen retreating to the back of the stands to avoid the scorching sun. referee @entity11 allowed three minutes on the half - hour and 75 - minute mark to cool off and take in drinks at @entity14 , while supporters maneuvered their way into pockets of shade			1
it is worrying , though , with the temperature of @entity21 - the controversial hosts of the 2022 tournament - more than capable of reaching in excess of 40 degrees			1
it has even been recorded at a worrying 53 degrees before			2
the area also suffers sandstorms during the dry season			0
in december and january - should the tournament become a winter @entity5 - @entity21 can be hit by rain showers , but the temperature will drop between a more modest mid 30s to mid 20s			1
the three minutes , which also gave @entity3 boss @entity49 and @entity2 manager @entity63 time to talk tactics , were added to stoppage time at the end of the half			1
as were the three minutes taken in the 75th minute			0
the breaks would certainly be needed in @entity21 , given temperatures can rise to a worrying 50 degrees			0
it has been argued that such heat would prove dangerous for both players and supporters			0
elsewhere , though , former @entity76 and @entity75 defender @entity74 joined in , taking to social media to show off a selfie of himself taking his own drinks break			0
but one man who the seemed to not be bothered by the heat was @entity49 , who kept his suit jacket on throughout as he watched his team concede two goals in as many minutes to crash out			0
@entity49 , the least - paid manager at the @entity5 on Â £ 125,000 - a - year , coped well with the heat since the tournament began , leading @entity3 out of a tough group a at the expense of @entity89 and @entity90			2
@entity91 too ! @entity74 took his own drinks break , taking to @entity92 to pose with his drink in the sun warm ? @entity3 manager @entity49 kept his jacket on during the clash with the @entity2 in the @entity5 last 16 a little cooler : @entity63 just wore a shirt for the match against @entity3 but still felt the heat			1

temperature *measured* at 38.8 degrees in @entity1 at @entity14

@entity21 between may and september likely to reach 40 degrees or more , and has been recorded as high as 53 degrees

@entity2 beat @entity3 2 - 1 to reach *quarter* - final or @entity5
