there 's a new true detective in town			0
a @entity4 police department has hilariously spoofed @entity7 's @entity6 car commercials , adding their own spin to reflect a night on the squad			1
@entity7 's ads are famous for the @entity12 - winning actor staring pensively through his window , contemplating life 's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car			1
sgt. @entity17 of the @entity18 in @entity4 hilariously spoofed @entity7 's @entity6 ads , adding his own spin to reflect a night on the squad @entity7 's ads are famous for the @entity12 - winning actor staring pensively through his window , contemplating life 's existential mysteries or just talking about how much he loves his car ' sometimes you got ta go back to actually move forward , and i do n't mean go back and reminisce or chase ghosts , ' he says in twisty dialogue that would make his true detective character @entity28 proud			1
@entity29 put sgt. @entity17 behind the wheel of a cop van for the parody , and at first @entity17 repeats @entity7 's dialogue word for word , in the same pensive deadpan voice			1
but things soon veer off from their original course			0
while @entity7 wonders about ' going back to where you came from ' , @entity17 talks about taking ' a big step back , ' like ' from winning rookie of the year to getting a couple of reflection days off '			1
@entity17 pretends to nod off for a second as he wonders ' who am i ? why am i still on duty ? what is this on my fingers and why wo n't it come off ? is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy i searched ? ' a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance , asking @entity17 if he 's okay because he 's only going five miles an hour			1
@entity17 's response ? ' that 's pretty good for an explorer ' ' you do n't get into police work because it makes sense , ' @entity17 then says			2
' you do it cause you thought it really looked cool on tv , or cause med school was out of the question			0
' as @entity7 drives under the bright city lights , its gas stations and flashing sirens that reflect in @entity17 's window as he ponders yet another night on the job			1
' i like being in here , ' he says in the video			0
' driving around all night long contemplating the important questions in life like " who am i ? why am i still on duty ? what is this on my fingers and why wo n't it come off ? " ' ' is it mystery pocket goo from that last guy i searched ? ' and , in the spoof , a prisoner makes a guest starring appearance , asking @entity17 if he 's okay because he 's only going five miles an hour			1
@entity17 's response ? ' that 's pretty good for an explorer '			2
the video was posted on the @entity18 's @entity100 page to celebrate hitting 4,000 @entity100 likes			1
lt. @entity101 told @entity102 that he , @entity17 and fellow officer @entity103 came up with the idea after watching @entity106 's spoof of the ads on @entity108			2
the video has more than half a million views and has been shared over 12,000 times			2
@entity101 attributes the success to the fact that the video humanizes police officers			0
' i think people want to laugh at us and see us as real people , ' he said			0
' we want people to remember this video , it sheds a light not just on our city but on other officers as well , and remember that police officers are normal people like you and me			0
' ' we laugh at the same things and we want people to see us as they are - we just do a different job			0
' both @entity101 and @entity17 said they are happy they 've created a something that is much more positive and comedic than the recent controversial videos featuring policemen around the country			2
' police officers do n't like to be stereotyped either , ' said @entity17			2
' so when something bad happens in another city , you 're always going to have that percentage of the public , no matter what , think we 're all corrupt and ca n't do anything right			0
' he added that to be able to put something out to humanize policemen and prove they 're ' not all the same ' , and get such a response from the public , was ' outstanding '			0

@entity29 originally created video for department *awards* *banquet*
features sgt. @entity17 behind wheel of a squad car instead of a @entity6
unlike @entity7 , he does n't contemplate life 's existential questions
instead wonders why he 's ' still on duty ' and if the goo on his fingers came from a previous *suspect* he just searched
has been viewed more than half a million times after department posted it on @entity100
