a terrified father who killed a burglar by hitting him in the head with a meat cleaver was justified in his actions , a coroner ruled yesterday			1
@entity9 had been bludgeoned with a wheel brace and his wife punched in the face as she cradled their two - year - old daughter after @entity15 and his brother @entity16 raided their home on a notorious estate in the middle of the night			1
a court heard the brothers subjected taxi driver mr @entity9 and his family to a ‘ harrowing and brutal attack ’ lasting 15 minutes			1
the violence stopped only when mr @entity9 , now 33 , found a meat cleaver and hit @entity15 with it , causing a ‘ sharp force trauma ’ to his head			1
the burglar , 32 , was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital			0
police initially launched a murder inquiry and arrested four people , including @entity9 and mrs @entity35 , now 32 , and the victim ’s brother			1
but no charges were ever brought against the couple after it was accepted mr @entity9 had acted in self - defence			1
police established the brothers had been targeting another person they thought lived at the address			0
when they realised they had the wrong victim , they decided to demand money from the @entity48 anyway			0
@entity1 , 21 , later admitted aggravated burglary and was jailed for eight - and - a - half years in december			0
sentencing him at @entity51 , judge @entity50 said mr @entity9 had been ‘ fully entitled ’ to pick up the cleaver to defend his family			1
the incident happened after mr @entity9 was marched into the sitting room of his home on @entity51 ’s @entity57 to get cash for the burglars			2
he hit @entity1 with the cleaver a number of times as the burglar attacked his wife and daughter			2
recording a verdict of lawful killing at an inquest in @entity51 on monday , coroner @entity66 said : ‘ the defensive action taken by mr @entity9 was proportionate and justified			2
‘ this was a harrowing and brutal experience for them , and i understand they are still traumatised			0
’ the inquest heard @entity15 punched mrs @entity35 in the face and pulled her hair to force her to watch as her husband was assaulted			2
he was left with blood streaming into his eyes from a head wound			0
@entity15 and his brother @entity16 broke into a house in @entity82 ( pictured ) on the @entity57 in @entity51 in march last year toxicology reports found traces of cocaine and alcohol in @entity1 ’s bloodstream			1
miss @entity66 said : ‘ mr @entity9 and his family were subjected to extreme violence and trauma			1
in the course of the action , mr @entity9 assaulted @entity15 , causing catastrophic injuries which led to his death			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity96 said : ‘ when deciding whether to prosecute any offence , the @entity96 will consider the @entity98 and any relevant guidance			0
the @entity96 has published guidelines concerning the reasonable use of force in cases where householders choose to defend themselves or their property			0
‘ in this case , these guidelines were applied and the @entity96 accepted that the householder had acted in self - defence , and that the correct course of action was to proceed with charges of aggravated burglary against the intruder and to take no further action against the householder			0
’ residents in the street where the attack took place said police moved the @entity48 to a secret location after the incident , telling their former neighbours : ‘ you wo n’t be seeing them again			0
’ a spokesman for @entity128 said yesterday the family remained ‘ very traumatised ’ and had since moved out of the region to make a fresh start .			0
