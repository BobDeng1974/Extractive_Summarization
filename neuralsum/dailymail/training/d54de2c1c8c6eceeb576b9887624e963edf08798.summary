by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 13:29 est , 14 january 2014 tragic : @entity2 , aged three , on holiday in @entity4 , in august 2011 , just before his fourth birthday a senior nurse in charge of a ' shambolic ' ward has admitted she can not remember any events before a young boy almost died from a heart attack			1
@entity12 , who works at @entity13 , also told an inquest into the death of four - year - old @entity2 she did not know whether she removed a tube administering fluid to the four - year - old			1
the tube had become infected so it was removed and replaced but he died a month later from a brain haemorrhage			1
his parents allege that the poor standard of nursing on the ward ' contributed to his death '			0
@entity2 suffered the heart attack shortly after the line - which had become infected - was removed and replaced			1
mrs @entity12 said she believes colleagues who say she was there , but @entity2 's parents @entity30 , 47 and @entity32 , 45 , claim she was not			1
hospital protocol states that two nurses must carry out the procedure while the patient is lying down			0
but according to @entity37 and mrs @entity38 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity2 was sitting in his father 's lap while the procedure carried out			1
yesterday the inquest heard that during his time on @entity2 had become so dehydrated that he sucked on wet wipes for the moisture			2
it was also claimed that doctors missed a series of warning signs , including continuous vomiting , a high loss of fluid , huge blood clots and high blood pressure			0
hopeful : @entity2 , from @entity39 , in @entity40 , excitedly told friends that doctors were going to ' mend his heart ' care : @entity2 , shown here on holiday in @entity4 , died in part due to poor nursing , according to his parents speaking to the inquest about the removal of the line , mrs @entity66 said : ' i ca n’t recall anything from that so i do n’t know if i was involved in the removal of the line of not			1
' but if someone says i was involved then i believe them			0
' i do n’t think i could forget and i do n’t think i could remember because i take out quite a few of those lines during the course of my work			0
' condition : @entity2 suffered from heart complications after being born with the organ in the wrong side of his chest when it became infected on february 16 doctors made the decision to remove and replace the line - but just 15 minutes later @entity2 suffered a heart attack			1
dehydration : his parents say that at one point @entity2 was sucking on tissues meant to cool his head in order to rehydrate himself mr @entity2 shook his head in disbelief as mrs @entity66 insisted she was present at the removal - something he denies			1
' i can not recall being involved in the removal on the femoral line but i can not say i was not either , ' she said			0
' i can not recollect at all what happened			0
a femoral line can be taken out by just one nurse but it is usual that there are two people that do it			2
' @entity110 , acting for the family , asked mrs @entity66 why mr @entity2 ’s version of events was different and why he remembered only one nurse taking out the line			1
he said : ' if that is right , that would be in breach of protocol ... would it not ? ' she replied : ' you could take a femoral line out in a parent ’s lap because we do n’t know if the child was sat up at times or laid flat at times			0
' @entity126 , another nurse on the ward , also gave her version of events , in which she admitted failing to create a seal in a chest drain on the first attempt			2
she said : ' when changing the chest line i accept i made a mistake , i forgot to put the water in to create a seal and when i clamped it and looked down to check that the seal had been made i noticed the water was not there			2
' mrs @entity126 also told the court she had assisted by mrs @entity66 in removing the femoral line , although conceded no notes had been made on @entity2 ’s charts to document this			2
grief : @entity38 , 45 and her husband @entity30 , 47 , who spoke yesterday at the inquest ' @entity149 was distracting @entity2 and stood next to him , i was holding his legs so he was still while @entity12 took the line out , ' mrs @entity126 added			1
the inquest also heard from the doctor in charge of @entity2 , @entity156 , who said he ' did not have time ' to supervise the procedure			2
dr @entity156 said he had told the nurses to remove the line , but was not there at the time			0
' i was not present during the whole of the procedure , ' he said			0
remembering : mr and mrs @entity38 hold a photograph of their son in their @entity40 home harrowing : mr and mrs @entity38 gave an account to the inquest of watching their son worsen and die ' i had gone to the nurses ' station and i would have come back to check on @entity2			1
' there was clearly a deterioration in @entity2 ’s condition ... it was a busy time			2
i had to talk to my colleagues , arrange blood tests and arrange his care			0
' i did not have the time to spend in detail at @entity2 ’s bedside			0
' my role was to delegate tasks and oversee tasks and to delegate			0
i would have not been present at the bedside			0
' inquest : mr and mrs @entity38 arriving yesterday at court for the inquest @entity2 was born with his heart on the wrong side of his body and blocked arteries between his heart and lungs			1
he underwent elective @entity198 surgery - designed to help his heart work more efficiently - on january 24 , 2012			2
he was moved out of the @entity199 ( @entity199 ) after just 18 hours when nurses told his parents his bed was needed and he was passed between @entity203 and @entity199 following other surgery			0
