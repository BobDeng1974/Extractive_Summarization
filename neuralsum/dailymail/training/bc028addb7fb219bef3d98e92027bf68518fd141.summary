by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 06:29 est , 16 november 2012 @entity2 's management today refuted claims he could be heading @entity4 to play football			1
the 37 - year - old and his family currently live in @entity8 , where he plays for @entity9 , but @entity11 's @entity10 ( @entity11 ) said it has been approached by his representatives			1
it could mean the sight of @entity15 gliding through @entity16 in her trademark sunglasses with well - travelled children @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 in tow			2
popular trip for @entity26 : @entity2 and @entity15 could be about to make a move to the other side of the world @entity2 signed a two - year deal with his current side in january , tying him to the @entity32 , but he could head across the world during the gap between seasons in the @entity36			1
the former @entity39 captain 's family would therefore not have to make another permanent move			2
@entity2 moved to the @entity32 from @entity42 's @entity41 as part of a £ 20million deal in 2007			1
he has previously joined @entity45 on loan between @entity48 seasons , so this could be another chance for @entity15 to tour the designer stores of the world 's most glamorous cities			2
earlier this month , however , there were rumours that @entity15 wanted to move to @entity56 to pursue her flourishing fashion career			1
an @entity11 spokesperson said : ' the approach from @entity2 's people is another sign of how much the @entity62 has grown in stature on a global basis			2
family holiday : @entity2 could move the whole brood - @entity15 , @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity67 - to the other side of the world ' @entity2 is a superstar on the world stage and he would be another massive signing for the @entity62 after the arrivals of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
' but this approach remains at a very preliminary stage			0
' reports in @entity11 suggest that any move for @entity2 would likely see him agree a 10 - match stay			1
a spokesman for @entity2 , however , refuted the claim , saying : ' @entity2 is completely focused on the @entity48 play offs and winning another @entity84 with the @entity9			1
' there 's always enormous interest from clubs across world in signing @entity2			2
he has absolutely no plans to play in @entity11			0
' @entity2 could play his last @entity9 game of the season this weekend when his side meet the @entity93 in the second leg of their western conference championship play - off			1
@entity96 have already stated an interest in @entity2 and @entity98 , executive chairman of the @entity99 , said the former @entity101 and @entity41 star would have obvious commercial appeal			1
eye on the ball : @entity2 could be set to make a short - term move to @entity11 he told @entity105 : ' we have n't had formal or informal contact over this , but clearly we are aware of the iconic vale of @entity2			1
we 've seen him here before on a couple of occasions			0
there was an 80,000 sell - out at the @entity113 and he was here with the @entity9 the year before last for a game against the @entity116			1
' he would be a fantastic commodity to bring to @entity11			0
' on the contradictory statements from the @entity11 and the @entity2 camp , mr @entity98 added : ' it is puzzling is n't it ? ' my understanding is there have been informal approaches to other clubs			2
one or two have already come out and talked about their interest			0
clearly there has been some informal discussions			0
' head boy : a spokesperson for @entity2 has dismissed the story @entity96 chief executive @entity133 said : ' we are always happy to speak to players of the calibre of @entity2 , who would be great for the @entity62			0
' at the end of the day it 's the coach , @entity139 , who makes these decisions and we as a club , have a process that we follow when recruiting players			0
' but we would be mad not to seriously consider @entity2			0
' yet @entity146 coach @entity145 has ruled out making an approach for the football superstar			0
' that 's great if he is coming , ' said @entity145 in local media			0
' would we be interested ? nah			0
