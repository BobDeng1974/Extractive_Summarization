by @entity0 last updated at 5:58 pm on 10th february 2012 a @entity2 surgical equipment set owned by an @entity4 commandant and war criminal has been withdrawn from a sale today after phone and e-mail threats			1
the wooden box of tools belonged to @entity12 , a major in the @entity4 who worked at the @entity16 concentration camp between july 1943 and february 1944 , where 140,000 @entity18 were held - and 33,000 of them died			1
the set had been due to go under the hammer at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , tomorrow			2
the wooden box of tools belonged to @entity12 , a major in the @entity4 who oversaw the @entity16 concentration camp between july 1943 and february 1944 disturbingly , given the contents of the box , there is no evidence that @entity32 ever received medical training			1
a separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors the case is marked ' instrumente gemischte ' , @entity39 for ' mixed instruments '			2
this has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the @entity45 into thinking it was for musical instruments @entity48 - born @entity12 was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name , eventually dying in @entity52 in 1991 at the age of 80 the police said the messages prompted safety concerns for staff and there will be a police presence at the auction even though the controversial lot has been withdrawn			1
the set contains instruments that would have been used in amputations including a saw and scalpels			2
it belonged to a late @entity18 man whose wife is the current owner			0
the man 's own parents survived the camp where they were held and married			1
@entity73 , partner at the @entity23 auction house , said : ' we 've had phone calls and e mails which were not of a particular nice nature			0
' some were pretty threatening and the police were concerned that an activist group might turn up			0
some of the contact was from people who had lost family members during the war and were not happy with the auction			1
' but there were a few that were really unpleasant			0
one said " i hope you die of cancer "			1
' it 's shame as our vendor was going to donate the money to the @entity97 charity			1
none of us felt particularly comfortable about the sale but the money was going to a good cause			1
' the set had a guide price of £ 2,000 and it had been hoped a museum would have bought it			0
news of the sale provoked outrage in the @entity18 community			1
@entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , the main representative body of @entity112 , said that ' to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling '			0
other @entity18 groups , including the @entity115 and @entity116 , said that the collection should be placed in an educational context , such as a museum			0
@entity16 was used as a propaganda tool during the @entity121 , with the @entity52 trying to fool the world that it was a ' paradise camp '			1
@entity16 , near what is now the town of @entity16 in the @entity126 , acted as a ghetto for 140,000 jews , with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as @entity132 and murdered @entity133 , executive director of the @entity135 @entity134 ' inexplicably there are those who have a grotesque fascination with @entity2 memorabilia and instruments used to inflict suffering on innocent adults and children			1
' i therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or academic institution that will use it for educational purposes			2
' @entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 ' there is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent history , and along with the countless books and films on the subject , from time to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the @entity160			0
' these things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened , and incontrovertibly show the claims of @entity160 deniers for the lies that they are			0
' however , to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects , and to risk that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the @entity172 , is deeply troubling			0
a more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical archive somewhere			0
' @entity176 , chief executive of the @entity116 ' wherever possible we believe @entity160 - era items should be presented in an educational context , so that as many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling time			0
' they even made a film showing happy workers shoeing horses and making handbags , while children played football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception			0
@entity12 played a key role in covering up the true horrors of the camp during stage - managed visits by the @entity45 - which were used to help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the watching world			1
disturbingly , given the contents of the box , there is no evidence that @entity32 ever received medical training			2
the mostly monogrammed equipment was put up for sale by an anonymous seller			2
before the withdrawal , ms @entity73 explained that the husband of the vendor was @entity18 , and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in @entity48			1
ms @entity73 said : ' this set was always in their home while they were married			0
' he would n't talk about his history but he used to spend a lot of time researching the @entity121			0
' the vendor 's husband passed away some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know how he came to own the instruments			0
ms @entity73 added : ' the father [ of the vendor 's husband ] used to deal during the war in the black market so we do n't know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came through the black market somehow , ' she said			1
' it is something we are never going to know			0
' the camp , near what is now the town of @entity16 in the @entity126 , acted as a ghetto for 140,000 jews , with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as @entity132 and murdered			1
just 1,900 were still alive when the ghetto was liberated by @entity250 troops on may 7 , 1945			0
@entity12 was ordered by @entity4 leader @entity251 and @entity252 , the orchestrator of the mass movement of @entity18 to camps in @entity256 , to change the appearance of @entity16 to fool @entity45 members who had requested access to a @entity2 concentration camp			1
many inmates were temporarily removed from the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors			2
@entity265 from @entity266 holds the macabre box , which was expected to fetch £ 2,000 - £ 4,000 fake shops and cafes were erected to give the false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort			2
the @entity45 representatives seemed to fall for the deception and the @entity172 went on to make a propaganda film at the camp			2
the fact that the wooden instrument case is marked ' instrumente gemischte ' , @entity39 for ' mixed instruments ' , has led to the theory that this may have been made as part of the deception , to suggest it was for musical instruments			0
a man lights a candle at an oven used during @entity121 to burn human corpses as members of @entity126 jewish community observe @entity292 in the former @entity2 concentration camp of @entity16 ' @entity12 was charged with changing the appearance of the camp , and a lot of the @entity18 there were musical so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case , ' ms @entity73 said			1
@entity48 - born @entity12 was sentenced to death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name , eventually dying in @entity52 in 1991 at the age of 80			1
it was only three years after his death , in 1994 , that anyone found out who the dead man really was			0
museums and other institutions showed an interest in the sale and ms @entity73 said they hoped it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive , educational setting .			2

box was property of ss major @entity12 , who ran concentration camp
auctioneers threatened if sale went ahead
one *letter* said : ' i hope you die of cancer '
cash from the sale would have gone to a war charity
