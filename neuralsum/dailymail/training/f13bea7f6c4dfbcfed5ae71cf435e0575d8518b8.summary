a computer server hosting information for @entity3 , the flagship @entity5 website that millions of @entity6 have trusted with their social security numbers , income totals and other sensitive personal information , was the subject of a hacker attack earlier this summer , officials said thursday			1
the federal government was n't aware it had been hacked on july 8 until just ten days ago			0
the admission is fueling fires on @entity15			0
the powerful @entity16 announced thursday afternoon that it has ordered @entity17 ( @entity17 ) chief @entity18 to testify in a september 18 hearing about the @entity5 website 's security lapses			1
still need health coverage ? the main @entity5 website was vulnerable to attack for nearly 7 weeks but malicious code inserted by hackers was never activated ' considering this administration launched @entity3 over the objections of @entity17 , it 's unsurprising that the website has suffered a " malicious attack " , ' said committee chairman @entity32 , a @entity35 @entity34 lawmaker			1
' for nearly a year , the administration has dismissed concerns about the security of @entity3 , even as it obstructed congressional oversight of the issue			0
... @entity18 must testify on the subject of transparency , accountability , and information security alongside the @entity44 at our september 18th hearing			2
' a congressional staffer told @entity48 that a briefing from @entity18 's agency revealed that malicious code inserted by the hackers was still dormant when technicians discovered it on august 25			1
@entity53 and @entity55 investigators said there was no evidence consumer information was compromised , but conceded that some of the @entity61 addresses where the attacks originated were located overseas			2
this is n't the first computer security flaw found in @entity3 's miles of code			2
in late october 2013 , just four weeks after the website was switched on and became a butt of jokes for its crash - prone flailing , a private software tester showed it was easy to hijack an account by resetting its password			0
another computer glitch temporarily caused @entity3 users to see endless strings of garbled text instead of words when they tried to log into the system last november			0
a security expert told @entity48 at the time that the flaw was evidence that the sprawling federal government should n't be trusted with such a wide - ranging project that could leave millions of people without recourse if skeptics ' worst fears were realized			2
in this case , however , government officials claim sensitive information was never at risk			0
rep. @entity32 ( right ) used his @entity16 chairmanship to subpoena @entity17 chief @entity18 ( left ) for a september 18 congressional showdown ' our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information ; data was not transmitted outside the agency , and the website was not specifically targeted , ' the @entity17 said in a statement			1
' we have taken measures to further strengthen security			0
' an @entity108 official told @entity109 that although some of the @entity53 server 's attackers were believed to be foreigners , the government does n't believe a state - sponsored operation , like those well - documented to have come from @entity117 , was behind it			1
because of a security flaw , a server that was not supposed to be accessible from the @entity61 was available accessed was not meant to be connected to the @entity61 , the @entity109 reported			2
' there was a door left open , ' an official told the newspaper			0
that door was a password that was still set to its default factory - fresh value when hackers probed it			0
a senior homeland security official told the @entity109 that ' if this happened anywhere other than @entity3 , it would n't be news ' – a chilling suggestion that government servers are vulnerable more frequently than @entity6 know			1
the attacked @entity5 server has been disconnected from other systems , officials said thursday , and retired from use			1
still need @entity137 ? ? ? the @entity5 website 's login process was a mess last november , another sign that the government may not have been ready for prime time system down : @entity3 began its online life as a serial punchline after @entity6 could n't access its signup features and untold numbers were forced to sign up on paper @entity151 sen. @entity150 , the @entity153 health committee 's senior @entity34 , blasted @entity53 on thursday as more details of the tech failure emerged			1
' this security failure is unacceptable – this administration has an obligation to keep @entity6 ' personal information safe and secure from computer hackers , ' @entity150 said in a statement , and default passwords wo n’t cut it			1
' ' in the coming days , i will be seeking information from @entity166 on how she plans to guard against this kind of security breach			0
' the code inserted by the unknown hackers was of the type intended to lay in waiting , like a terrorist sleeper - cell , until it 's called upon later to bombard other servers with repeated requests designed to slow it down			1
@entity177 reported thursday that computer systems tied to state - based health insurance exchanges have also been targeted by malicious overseas hackers			0
in one case , the magazine recounted , ' a @entity182 hacker gained access to the health exchange ’s development server for a month ' before software developers managed to find out .			0

malicious code was inserted into an @entity5 server and lay dormant , waiting for a command to attack other computers
@entity196 administration claims there 's no evidence attack was sponsored by an *unfriendly* country or exposed @entity6 ' personal information
vulnerable server was left with its default password and was n't supposed to be accessible from the *internet*
@entity16 @entity34 have subpoenaed the @entity17 chief for a september 18 *grilling*
