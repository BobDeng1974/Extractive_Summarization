by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 13:37 est , 26 october 2012 oil tycoon @entity1 has won his lengthy legal battle to cut his ex-wife 's payout an oil tycoon who used @entity7 law to attempt to strip his ex-wife of a £ 17.5million divorce payout has won a landmark case to slash the money by £ 9million			1
multi-millionaire @entity1 , 50 , one of @entity13 's most successful black businessman , originally claimed under ' native ' @entity7 law his oil company did n't belong to him			1
and despite being slammed for his ' ingenious and dishonest ' attempts to conceal his huge wealth from the divorce courts , he has won his marathon legal fight			1
one of the country ’s top family judges said that ' there were almost no lengths to which he was not prepared to go ' in his fight to cut down his 49 - year - old ex-wife @entity25 ’s divorce settlement			0
although she insisted he was worth ' tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds ' and asked for an award of £ 30.4 million , he was adamant he was worse than penniless , with net debts of £ 48 million , and said his ex was entitled to only just over £ 2 million			0
after a marathon dispute that ran up ' astronomical ' legal costs of more than £ 3 million - and during which mr @entity1 ' repeatedly flouted ' his duty to fully and frankly disclose his assets - he was last year ordered to give his ex-wife money and assets worth £ 17.5 million			1
however , in a ruling today that award was cut by up to £ 9 million by the @entity40			0
in a majority decision - which exposed a gaping rift between family and commercial lawyers - the court ruled the divorce judge had been wrong to ' pierce the corporate veil ' and award @entity48 six @entity50 properties owned by companies that her ex-husband was said to control			0
family law specialist , @entity54 , said : ' once the marriage broke down , the husband resorted to an array of strategies , of varying degrees of ingenuity and dishonesty , in order to deprive his wife of her accustomed affluence			0
' amongst them is the invocation of company law measures in an endeavour to achieve his irresponsible and selfish ends			0
if the law permits him so to do it defeats the @entity75 judge ’s overriding duty to achieve fairness '			0
however , his powerful dissenting judgment was overruled by @entity78 , who said the divorce judge had simply been ' wrong ' to equate the companies that owned the properties with mr @entity1 and to regard their assets as his			1
even though mr @entity1 had been found to be in control of the companies , the divorce judge simply had no power to find that he was personally entitled to the properties they owned or to pierce the corporate veil and award them to his ex-wife			1
costly divorce : @entity94 outside @entity50 's @entity95 in an earlier court appearance lord @entity97 , who had the casting vote , agreed the appeal - which was brought by three companies that own a portfolio of flats and houses in @entity50 worth £ 9m - should be allowed			2
issuing a resounding warning to wealthy couples , the judge said that those tempted to transfer assets to companies for wealth protection or tax avoidance purposes ' can not ignore the legal consequences of their actions in less happy times '			0
the highly educated couple married in 1993 and had four children , now all teenagers , and enjoyed an ' extravagant lifestyle ' until their split in 2008			0
mr @entity1 told the divorce judge he needed £ 800,000 - a - year to live on and his ex said she required £ 730,000 - a - year to keep herself and the children in the style to which they were accustomed			1
despite his claims that he was £ 48m in debt , mr @entity125 found last year that mr @entity1 was worth ' conservatively ... at least £ 37.5m ' and had been treating the court proceedings ' as a game ' to defeat or minimise his ex-wife entitlements			1
mr @entity1 , who was named as one of the three most influential black men in @entity13 in 2007 , was also ordered to pay maintenance of £ 24,000 - a - year for each of his four children , along with their private school fees and medical bills			1
lawyers for the three companies that bought the appeal insisted that their assets did not belong to mr @entity1 but are ' held in trust ' for his children and the children of his four siblings in @entity7 , under @entity146 customary law			2
mr @entity1 , the court heard , received a gift of £ 10,000 ' seed money ' from his @entity146 father before he died in 1992 , and he used that cash as the foundation stone on which he built his oil and property empire			2
under customary law in @entity159 , his father ’s death left mr @entity1 as head of his family , with a responsibility to use his late father ’s money to look after his siblings and their children , his legal team argued			2
however mrs @entity48 ’s lawyers have always insisted that the companies , and the assets they hold , are ' 100 % owned and controlled ' by her ex-husband and that they are effectively his ' alter ego			0

@entity1 , slammed for being ' dishonest ' , is one of @entity13 's most successful black businessmen
