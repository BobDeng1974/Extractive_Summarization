by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 07:08 est , 13 january 2014 an elderly woman has revealed that she has handed over £ 200,000 to fraudsters after half a century of being targeted with letters claiming that she had won a fortune			1
@entity7 , 76 , became addicted to answering the scam letters , which demanded that she pay a small amount of money in order to receive the thousands of pounds she was supposedly owed			1
among the frauds she was caught up in were claims that she had won the lottery and a letter from a so - called psychic offering to pass on her powers to mrs @entity7			2
the pensioner says that her inability to ignore the fraudulent messages led to the break - up of her marriage and caused her to have a nervous breakdown			0
tricked : @entity7 has given £ 200,000 to fraudsters over half a century after receiving begging letters last year local officials were forced to step in and protect mrs @entity7 , saying that she had been exploited worse than anyone else they had ever encountered			1
the retired cleaner from @entity33 in @entity34 first started receiving begging letters from fraudsters at the age of 20 , and was soon sucked in to a series of scams			1
typically , they would tell her that she was eligible for a prize worth thousands of pounds , but first had to hand over a smaller sum such as £ 20 or £ 100 as a ' transaction fee '			0
some of the letters have been still more outlandish - one recent example claimed to come from a clairvoyant named ' @entity47 ' and told mrs @entity7 she could inherit the psychic 's mystical abilities			1
the victim said she was unable to stop responding to the letters even though they were obviously hoaxes , adding that the fraudsters sent her so many messages that she believed they had a personal relationship			2
anger : the scammers took advantage of the 76 - year - old because they knew she was vulnerable suffering : @entity61 said that mrs @entity7 's case was the worst one they had ever encountered ' the scammers used to write me personal letters , i 'd look forward to getting them , ' she told @entity68 's @entity67			1
' i thought they were my friends - but they were out to rip me off			0
' mrs @entity7 added : ' all the mail that i have been getting i realised was spam mail , spam letters - but it does get you all excited and they should n't do that to old people , it 's not right			2
' i can honestly say i 've never had one penny over all these years			0
but in your mind , if you 're a believer , you believe it and that 's it - it becomes like an addiction			0
' she said that she had suffered a number of medical issues - including a nervous breakdown - as a result of the letters , and her obsession with the bogus payouts destroyed her relationship with her first husband			0
the pensioner was one of 80 people identified by @entity61 as being particularly vulnerable to scammers , leading trading standards officials to intervene			1
pile : the pensioner still receives dozens of letters a week despite the council intervening mrs @entity7 now knows to ignore the begging letters , but still receives dozens of messages a week because fraudsters regard her as a promising target			1
@entity107 of @entity108 said : ' this is the worst case we have come across , but i would n't be surprised if there were worst out there that we have n't come across yet			0
' we want to encourage people to speak to their elderly neighbours and friends and if they are receiving these types of mail , to make sure they are not responding to them and to point out they are not going to get any money , they are just lining the pockets of fraudsters			2
' mr @entity107 added : ' sometimes people are quite lonely , it 's their only contact with the outside world , they do feel addicted and i know people find it hard to understand			0
' @entity7 is one of those people and it 's quite brave of her to come forward and be highlighted as a victim to warn others			2
' @entity129 , a government body which aims to help the victims of scams , warned @entity133 to beware of any messages asking them to hand over money in exchange for an unexpected reward .			0

@entity7 , 76 , began receiving letters from fraudsters when she was 20
she sent conmen small amounts of money in order to claim a payout
but the pensioner has never received any of the promised *winnings*
@entity61 stepped in to stop the scam after officials discovered her *plight*
