by @entity0 for the @entity1 plans for a new £ 10million @entity4 floodlit circuit at @entity5 , which would have opened next year , have been knocked off track by the @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s ruling body has refused to allow dispensation from a rule , designed to protect the sport ’s diversity , which states each individual fixture must include at least two races over a mile or further which total a minimum aggregate distance of two and a half miles			0
@entity5 needed the permission because planning restrictions mean their new track would only have lights on its straight mile and not the round course			2
out of @entity24 : @entity5 's plans for new all - weather circuit have been delayed by the @entity7 while the need for a new @entity30 track in the north is widely accepted , there is strong opposition to @entity5 digging up its turf circuit			1
in an increasingly bitter debate , the @entity7 have bought some time			2
@entity35 , the largest racecourse company in @entity36 which owns @entity5 , described the delay to its plans as ‘ unwelcome ’ but insisted it will press on with the project			0
however , any re-submitted proposals next year are likely to see their aspirations to build an aw track competing with rival plans being formulated by @entity44			1
the @entity7 is now committed to further talks with both courses			0
its chief executive @entity47 said : ‘ there is a general consensus among stakeholders that there would be benefits to the sport from an all - weather track in the north			1
‘ we weighed up the advantages of introducing a floodlit northern all - weather track at @entity5 in the latter part of 2015 against the negative race planning impact and associated implications for the sport as a whole of granting an exemption to a key rule of racing			1
‘ as a result , the @entity67 decided there was insufficient evidence at this time to justify granting an exemption to the rule for the @entity73			0
‘ @entity7 will continue discussions with @entity35 around its plans for @entity5 , including matters relating to the existing turf track , plus other interested parties , including @entity78			1
competition : @entity44 race course is expected to launch a rival bid for an @entity4 circuit ‘ this is clearly a significant issue for the long - term structure and development of @entity36 racing , and @entity7 is tasked with reaching the best outcome for the sport as a whole			1
’ @entity35 , limited by their planning restrictions , appear to have no scope to alter the @entity94 track lay - out			0
so , while they have more time to make their case , the facts are unlikely to alter much			0
but spokeswoman @entity97 insisted @entity5 , with the proposed development of its facilities for racegoers , remains the best option for a new @entity4 track , saying it would be a ‘ @entity105 of the north ’			2
she added : ’ as well as what we can offer the @entity109 , we would be a popular venue on thursday , friday and saturday evenings			0
i am not sure @entity44 would be			0

@entity5 plan new £ 10m all - weather circuit to be opened in 2015
@entity7 have delayed permission over rules concerning circuit length
rival bid for aw circuit in the north is expected from @entity44
