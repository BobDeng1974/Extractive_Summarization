@entity0 and @entity1 will be given the opportunity to challenge @entity4 ’s status as @entity6 ’s premier playmaker , as long as they emerge unscathed from @entity8 matches this weekend			1
national coach @entity9 is due to name his autumn test squad next wednesday and the five - way contest for no 10 places has been a subject of constant intrigue during the early stages of the season			1
@entity4 ’s place is assured , but @entity18 has learned that @entity19 and @entity1 have done enough to earn selection ahead of the other prime candidates ; @entity22 and @entity23			1
that pair are set to be named in the @entity26 squad , barring any fly - half injuries in the coming days			1
@entity29 fly - half @entity0 is expected to make the squad after missing @entity6 's summer tour through injury @entity22 is set to be left out after making his comeback on @entity6 's summer tour of @entity35 @entity36 's @entity4 ( left ) and @entity37 's @entity1 are expected to make the cut @entity40 fly - half @entity23 ( left ) is also expected to be left out of @entity9 's ( right ) squad @entity18 's sir @entity42 caught up with @entity44 fly - half @entity22 to exclusively talk all things @entity6 @entity19 is the form man , based on his exploits in the first six rounds of @entity50 matches			1
he has played every minute of every game for @entity29 – a total of 480 – and tops the scoring charts , with 84 points and 33 successful kicks			0
the 21 - year - old has recovered ground rapidly , having missed @entity6 ’s june tour of @entity35 , in order to have shoulder surgery			1
in his absence , and with @entity4 initially delayed and then injured , @entity23 started the first and third @entity62 – with @entity22 making replacement appearances on those occasions , in @entity65 and @entity66			1
both men returned from the trip with renewed hope about their @entity71 prospects , but the delayed announcement of the @entity6 squad has apparently counted against them			1
@entity22 has shone in patches but has been hampered by @entity44 ’s unconvincing start to the season , while @entity23 made a good early impact for new club @entity40 , but his momentum was knocked during the @entity40 ’ run of three defeats and @entity81 has taken over goal - kicking duties			1
on form alone , @entity19 would surely start the autumn opener against the @entity35 at @entity85 on november 8 , based on his all - court attacking game , allied to improved defence and composure under pressure			1
@entity1 would also be ahead of @entity4 on the basis of recent exploits alone – having added layers of subtle variety under the tutelage of @entity96 at @entity37 , while maintaining his trademark precision			1
@entity4 was eased into the new campaign gently after a knee injury ended his tour and he has played a total of just 99 minutes for @entity36 so far , scoring 21 points			2
but he has repeatedly proved his big - game credentials and providing he returns to action this weekend , as his club insist he will , then the @entity106 will no doubt force his way back to the head of the queue			2
@entity22 sits down and talks to sir @entity42 about his @entity6 career @entity22 , in action for sale against @entity37 , has been in good form for his club another often - discussed option would be for @entity6 to unleash @entity19 and @entity4 in tandem , as a 10 - 12 combination which was hugely effective at junior level			1
asked on monday if it was a possibility , @entity9 told @entity119 : ‘ yes , we did that in the @entity121 game ( at the end of last season ’s @entity123 )			2
‘ @entity4 was starting at 10 and @entity0 was on the bench			1
we brought @entity0 on and @entity4 moved to 12 , so it has been done and obviously as age - grade players they played together all the time so they understand each other and they are best mates as well			1
’ another man who may soon emerge as an @entity6 no 12 contender is the union convert - in - waiting , @entity133			1
the rugby league icon will join @entity29 in the coming weeks , when he has recovered from facial surgery and @entity9 knows that the newcomer is aiming high , saying : ‘ having spoken to him , his mind - set obviously is to make the @entity71 squad			1
‘ we have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn the game quickly			0
but he also does n’t want to come just for the @entity71 , we talked about the @entity123 2016 , the @entity145 tour at the end of 2016 , the @entity147 in 2017 ; these are all goals for him			0
’ @entity133 has been an rugby league star , and hopes his code switch will ready him for the union @entity71 @entity133 fractured his cheekbone and eye socket playing his last match for the @entity154 @entity155 is hugely enthused by @entity133 ’s potential , adding : ‘ what struck me when i met him is obviously he is an exceptional rugby player , but a leader too			0
he is mentally tough , mentally strong and when we talk about that experience and that leadership that you need in your team , if he can learn the game he will bring an invaluable amount to the group			2
obviously he has got to learn the game first but he is a very , very good player and an impressive person			0
‘ he has a desire to dominate his opposite number and he ’s played against some huge stars in rugby league			0
he ’s taken the decision to go out to @entity145 at 18 years old because he wants to test himself and that ’s a big thing to do			0
he ’ s done that , he ’s achieved it and now he sees another challenge in front of him and you ’ve got to admire someone who has that sense of mental strength			0
it will be fascinating to see how he goes			0
’ yet , one of those current @entity6 centres who will doing their utmost to block @entity133 ’s path to the top is another cross-code international and @entity29 player – @entity189			2
last week , he was named @entity190 for september and he has evidently made a strong impression on @entity155 after a disappointing end to his tour of @entity35			2
‘ he is rather good and he has really developed this season , ’ said the coach			0
‘ obviously he had a great first test and things did n’t go for us as a back line in the third test			0
i had a good chat with him afterwards and he had a steely determination in his mind , i could see him at that point saying , “ @entity207 , i ’ll be back next season and i ’ll be ready ”			0
@entity189 of @entity29 skips away from @entity210 prop @entity209 in the @entity50 on sunday @entity212 youngster @entity211 has also played himself into @entity6 contention with his club form @entity215 v @entity216 ‘ he said the same thing to @entity29 and he ’s been outstanding this season so he ’s really putting a marker down for the november internationals			2
but i watched @entity221 at the weekend and he was outstanding			0
there ’s also @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity211 ’s playing well at 13 ; the list goes on			0
’ @entity9 and his assistants will prepare for the gruelling series of four @entity62 next month with the added reassurance of new , long - term deals with the @entity230 , running until the end of the 2019 - 20 season			1
the union ’s announcement of the contract extensions prompted speculation about how they might respond in the event of @entity71 disappointment next year , but the management still expect to be judged on merit			0
‘ we ’re delighted that we ’ve got the support of the @entity230 and the board , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ i do n't think when you ’re a coach of a national side you ever get room for complacency			0
i do n’t want to leave any stone unturned so i do n't think there will be any complacency			0
we are judged , as we know , by results and we will be judged that way , and for me there will be no complacency			0
