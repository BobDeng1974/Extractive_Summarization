every time i say i believe in @entity3 , people look a bit embarrassed			1
it ’s become one of those subjects most people do n’t want to discuss			1
we can talk face - to - face and chat online about our sex lives , our children and our fantasy partners , but we hesitate to reveal whether we believe in life after death			1
at @entity17 , the most important religious festival for @entity18 , politicians go through hoops to avoid talk of the @entity21 ( @entity3 ) word , for fear of alienating voters			1
although @entity26 ( left ) has been visiting relatives in @entity28 , he calls himself a @entity30 atheist			1
@entity31 believes it is refreshing to hear @entity33 ( right ) admit he uses the @entity34 as a support system @entity26 , who has been visiting relatives in @entity28 , says he hopes to become the first @entity30 prime minister			1
he was born into a @entity30 family , but says he does n’t believe in @entity3 — calling himself a @entity30 atheist			1
i struggle with that ; it ’s religion - lite			1
how do other @entity30 feel about someone who is @entity30 , but does n’t believe in @entity3 ? is n’t it a bit of a pick ’ n ’ mix approach to fundamentals ? i imagine some are highly offended			1
@entity51 says he does n’t believe in @entity3 , but his three sons are being brought up as @entity53 to please his wife			1
@entity55 seems wet , as usual — i suspect he ’s an atheist because he ( mistakenly ) believes it will offend the least number of people			1
but , whether you are a @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 or @entity64 , you believe in something , a higher power			1
@entity51 has made the wrong call			1
@entity68 also brought up his children as @entity53 to please @entity70 , and made quite a show of his spirituality whenever i went to interview him			1
since leaving office he has attended @entity74 regularly , but has n’t commented on his faith since @entity76 once famously remarked that ‘ we do n’t do @entity3 ’			1
refreshingly , @entity33 recently admitted he turns to the @entity34 for support in difficult times — most notably after his son @entity80 ’s sad death			1
@entity33 says he finds ‘ a little bit of peace and hopefully a little bit of guidance ’ when he attends @entity84 at the church attached to his children ’s @entity64 school			1
@entity33 does n’t flaunt his beliefs — he ’s a typical , slightly embarrassed @entity64 , who turns up in church at feasts and festivals and only prays when the proverbial has hit the fan			1
there ’s nothing wrong in that			1
i ’m just pleased that @entity33 , who regularly attends state events with leaders of the @entity34 and the @entity103 , is n’t one of the two - faced cynics in government and is happy to say he believes in @entity3			1
in our modern world of sneerers , that takes a lot of guts			1
@entity31 could not resist a quick snap by this funny sign i ’ve just started filming a new @entity116 series about food with lovely chef @entity118			1
last week we were in @entity119 , where our hotel was of the @entity122 variety			1
i asked for an extra light for my dimly lit room — it never arrived			2
i asked for plain yoghurt — they did n’t have any			2
when we went for breakfast at 7.30am they were still putting out the buffet and there was no one to take our order			2
the walls were so thin i could hear a couple sneezing next door and someone going to the loo upstairs			2
luckily , the countryside is divine and i could n’t resist a quick snap by this sign : please do n’t send in your comments ! i resisted the urge to paint out the letters ‘ wo ’			2
@entity148 irritate me , it does n’t matter which voice i set , patronising female or prissy bloke			2
it ’s the way they repeat instructions over and over , as if the driver is utterly dumb — i ’ve even started talking to my partner like a sat nav , repeating all instructions ( ie orders ) , such as ‘ take the rubbish out ’ , three times			1
now , inventors in @entity162 have developed sat nav shoes — which come with an app that can be downloaded to a smartphone			2
not impressed : inventors in @entity162 have developed sat nav shoes using a @entity168 link to communicate with the phone - mapping system , the shoes emit a buzz if you go in the wrong direction			2
they can even be programmed to monitor how many calories you ’re burning , like my @entity176 , which is ‘ resting ’ on a shelf because i do n’t want to fail at more than one thing a day			2
maps are the joy of my life — i have collected hundreds over the years , and the last thing i need is a clever shoe			2
sadly , map sales have plummeted by 40 per cent thanks to sat navs , and in future @entity185 will only print some on demand			2
gps devices do n’t make for enjoyable walking — why spend your time staring at a screen when you can read a map and then pop it in your pocket ? when i started presenting telly shows in 1975 , the studio complexes had bars that were open all day and people drank vast amounts			2
i do n’t know how any work got done after 3pm			2
now , it ’s very different			0
working in a tv studio is like going into a factory			0
people grab a sandwich , dressing rooms get used for two or three different shows a day			0
the only time you might get a glass of cheap wine is after recording has finished around 10pm			0
back in the @entity215 , filming on location , we stopped for a proper lunch ; now , we grab something quick on the go as budgets have been slashed and working days extended			0
cleared : @entity220 this has been my experience of the past 40 years , so i was nauseated to read about what goes on in @entity225 — researchers and mps groping and getting sloshed night after night			0
it sounds as if they are living in a time warp			0
former deputy speaker @entity220 , cleared of sex allegations , now says he was ‘ drunk from time to time			0
but not plastered every night ’			0
even so , i ’d like to know why taxpayers are subsidising bars and canteens in @entity225			0
i ’d close half the bars for good , shut the rest during the day and charge premium prices			0
as for canteens , most of us get a quick lunch at @entity243 , @entity244 or @entity245			0
why should @entity227 be any different ? @entity246 ( pictured ) is hosting the new @entity116 follow - up to bake off : the @entity248 the sun came out at the weekend , so i succumbed to garden centre impulse purchasing			0
you know the story — a trip to get one ‘ essential ’ ( cleaner to remove the green slime brought on by the wet winter from the patio ) ends up with me pushing a trolley full of plants and a bill for £ 83			0
how did that happen ? tomorrow sees the start of @entity262 , with events taking place up and down the country , from @entity266 to @entity267 , @entity268 to @entity269			0
experts are on call to answer queries and before next friday i am bound to be back at another garden centre buying even more plants			0
tomorrow , the @entity116 is kicking off its much - publicised follow - up to @entity275 , hosted by @entity246 , with a judging panel including the @entity278 ’s former head gardener			0
i come from a family of vegetable growers : my paternal grandfather and father spent every free hour digging , nurturing rows of potatoes , leeks , wonderful lettuces and carrots , probably as a way to escape their carping wives			0
i ’ve already planted out some broad beans on my plot in @entity294 , as well as cabbages , leeks , lettuces and onions			0
baby beetroot plants are on stand - by in the cold frame			0
it could hail or snow right up to early may and i could lose the lot , but that ’s the risk we brave gardeners are prepared to take to get ahead			0
if the temperature drops , i shall be swaddling the plants in fleece and polythene , and telling them to buck up			0
it ’s weird the @entity116 are launching this show when we are eating less fruit and veg than ever — on average , just 3.9 portions out of our recommended five a day			0
meanwhile , some experts think five is not enough , claiming we really need seven or even ten			0
i think @entity246 will be presiding over the green fingers equivalent of cookery porn : we ’ll be salivating over the marrows and aubergines , but how many viewers will eat them , let alone grow them from scratch ? very few .			0

@entity33 admits he turns to the @entity34 for support in difficult times
@entity31 thinks his *admission* is refreshing and courageous
