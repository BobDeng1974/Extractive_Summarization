it was set to take place on 11 july , the day after his tagging order ended but the race was moved a week earlier			2
' he was rowing for the @entity17 against the lords			1
' he said the bulky nature of the tag would make it difficult for @entity6 to row , and that he was aware the press attention that would be brought by him wearing the tag , so he removed it			1

' you made a clear decision to breach the order			0
it ’s not a reasonable excuse			0
' @entity6 , who paid the fine before leaving court , said afterwards : ' it ’s quite a stiff penalty but i ’m an mp and it ’s perhaps an attempt to persuade others not to do the same			1
' the event was very high profile and for charity			2

if i turned up wearing my tag , that ’s what all the papers focus would be on			2
me and not the charity			2
i did n’t feel that was fair			0
