a time - lapse video of an mysterious optical phenomenon captured by @entity2 is certain to leave his fellow photographers green with envy			1
@entity2 was making a video of a @entity8 sunset on the north shore of @entity10 about two weeks ago when his @entity12 camera caught a rare green flash			1
the time - lapse footage depicts the sun descending from a bank of dark clouds and gradually dipping into the ocean as a pod of whales jump out of the water			0
just before the sun entirely vanishes below the horizon , a sliver of the ocean surface and the darkening sky are illuminated green for a brief moment			0
according to @entity39 , the almost - mythic spectacle is caused by the atmospheric bending and scattering of sunlight			1
acting like a prism , the atmosphere of the @entity44 breaks white sunlight into individual colors , bending red colors slightly , and green and blue hues through increasingly larger angles			0
the footage depicts the sun descending from a bank of dark clouds and gradually dipping into the ocean a pod of breaching whales are also captured in the 15 second time lapse footage as the sunsets on a clear day , a lucky observer can catch a glimpse of a green glint just above the sun 's edge for a split second			2
the phenomenon , which lasts only a few second , can also occur at sunrise .			0
