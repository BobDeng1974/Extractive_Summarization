by @entity0 @entity1 is primed and ready to make his long - awaited @entity3 comeback next month			1
the @entity5 star was pictured looking focused in training with @entity8 's side on monday ahead of their international against the @entity11 on june 1			1
while his inclusion in this squad does n't guarantee a place on next month 's tour to @entity16 , @entity1 appears to be knuckling down			1
telling them what 's what ! @entity1 is back in the @entity3 fold ahead of the tour of @entity16 having a dart : the @entity24 star was pit through his paces as @entity3 trained in @entity27 all smiles : @entity1 is in line to play against the @entity11 at @entity30 on june 1 and @entity8 does n't see bringing him back into the hold as a risk			1
‘ i do n’t view it as a risk , ’ he said			0
‘ it is an opportunity			0
ultimately , selection will be affected by how effective @entity1 is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan			2
‘ if he ’s good enough he ’ll get the opportunity to go to @entity16 and if he ’s not quite ready he ’ll hopefully play in the @entity11 game ( at @entity30 on june 1 ) as the beginning of his return to international rugby			1
‘ i ’ve spoken to him in part ( about team culture ) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp			0
i ’ll arrange a one - on - one with every player			0
@entity1 ’s might be a little bit longer			0
but of course he can train his way on to the plane			0
’ a new man ? picking @entity1 for this squad is n't a risk according to head coach @entity8			2
