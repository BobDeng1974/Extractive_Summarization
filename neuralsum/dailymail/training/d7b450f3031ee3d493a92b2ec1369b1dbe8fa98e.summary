by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 19 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:00 est , 19 november 2013 you might admire these exotic - looking bouquets dripping with delicate blooms , but you 'll never be able to buy one			0
this is because the flowers do not exist - they are entirely the product of complex mathematical equations teamed with an artist 's imagination			2
@entity16 - based designer and digital artist @entity14 recently created the portfolio of strange posies for an installation at the @entity20 at the @entity21			2
@entity22 : digital artist @entity14 's flowers do not exist - they are entirely the product of complex mathematics mixed with his imagination ' i have been working on my flower series since around 2000 , ' mr @entity14 told @entity30			1
' i realised that floral animation was a way that advanced computer technology could be related back to everyday culture			2
' in 2003 , however , mr @entity14 suffered a devastating spinal injury following a swimming accident that left him paralysed from the shoulders down			1
' it meant i could no longer draw or paint , but was fortunately still able to use an adapted computer , ' he said			0
' i find inspiration in many places , ' said mr @entity14			1
' much of my work involves working on computer graphics for fashion , and through that often see a shape or texture , or even just the way light falls on an object - and think it would look fantastic on a flower ' @entity16 - based designer and digital artist @entity14 recently created the portfolio of strange posies for an installation at the @entity20 at the @entity21 mr @entity14 used cutting edge 3d technology , more commonly used for computer games and cinema features , to create the realistic - looking flowers that resemble undiscovered orchids ' my flowers took on an extra significance then ; by creating these flowers i could still create art. ' mr @entity14 , who is unable to hold a pen , used cutting edge 3d technology that is more commonly used for computer games and cinema features			1
@entity71 was paralysed from the shoulders down after a swimming injury broke his neck			0
he is unable to use more than a finger to type so relies of formulae to ' paint ' the flowers ' much of my work involves working on computer graphics for fashion , and through that often see a shape or texture , or even just the way light falls on an object - and think it would look fantastic on a flower , ' said mr @entity14 @entity91 's head of computer design @entity92 said of @entity14 's work : ' @entity14 's work changes the way we look at and engage with digital imagery			1
it is technically innovative and emotionally engaging , but also gives us an extraordinary amount of freedom in the way we experience it ' sir @entity104 was a @entity105 biologist , mathematician , and classics scholar			1
@entity104 ’s master work was ' on growth and form '			0
in this book he argued that biological form could reflect physical and mathematical principles			1
for instance , he showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid			0
@entity14 's current series was originally entitled ‘ @entity124 ’ in homage to @entity104 ’s pioneering book			2
mr @entity14 uses a baseline algorithm to create a flower form that he adapts each time to create new , individual ' species ' - with no two flowers ever looking the same			1
the ' photographs ' were commissioned by the @entity131 with grant funding from the @entity133			0
the work uses shapes and textures taken from and inspired by exhibits in the museum and is part of the museum ’s ‘ renew ’ programme '			0
mr @entity14 was inspired by sir @entity104 's use of mathematical drawings to explain biology			1

' ' in many ways it is like creating artificial life			0
' the current series was originally entitled ‘ @entity124 ’ in homage to @entity104 ’s pioneering book written in 1915			0
in this book , sir @entity104 argued that biological form , and in turn evolutionary principles , could be explained with mathematical principles			1
the current series was originally entitled ' on growth and form ' in homage to @entity104 's pioneering book of the same name			0
in this book , sir @entity104 argued that biological form could reflect physical and mathematical principles previous pieces from mr @entity14 's series have been exhibited at the @entity179 and a three - story - high projected version was commissioned by the @entity182 as the entrance feature for their ' decode – @entity187 ' show that took place from december 2009 to april 2010			1
mr @entity14 was voted @entity189 in 2004 – the year after @entity91 's head of computer design @entity92 was also awarded this major national accolade			1
' @entity14 's work changes the way we look at and engage with digital imagery , ' said mr @entity92			2
' it is technically innovative and emotionally engaging , but also gives us an extraordinary amount of freedom in the way we experience it			0

pieces were created by @entity14 after he became paralysed from shoulder down following a swimming accident
mr @entity14 uses complex algorithms and 3d technology that is more commonly used for computer games and films
the technique means that the realistic - looking flowers grow on screen like time - lapse *documentary* photography
he was inspired by sir @entity104 who argued that nature could reflect physical and mathematical principles
