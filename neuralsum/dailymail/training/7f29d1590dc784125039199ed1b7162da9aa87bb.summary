by @entity0 if you 've ever been caught in a rainstorm , you may have thought there is nothing worse			0
however , researchers have revealed a major new insight into rain on the sun - and say it puts our own into perspective			0
just like on @entity12 , the @entity11 has spells of bad weather , with high winds and showers of rain			1
at the top left the @entity12 is depicted on the same scale			2
rain on the @entity11 is made of electrically charged gas ( plasma )			0
it falls at around 200,000 kilometres an hour from the outer solar atmosphere , the corona , to the @entity11 's surface			1
the thousands of droplets that make up a ' coronal rain ' shower are themselves each as big as @entity41			1
but unlike the all - too - frequent storms on @entity12 , rain on the @entity11 is made of electrically charged gas ( plasma ) and falls at around 200,000 kilometres an hour from the outer solar atmosphere , the corona , to the @entity11 's surface			1
and the thousands of droplets that make up a ' coronal rain ' shower are themselves each as big as @entity41			1
a team of solar physicists , led by dr @entity51 of @entity52 , have pieced together an explanation for this intriguing phenomenon , with imagery that shows a ' waterfall ' in the atmosphere of the @entity11 discovered almost 40 years ago , solar physicists are now able to study coronal rain in great detail thanks to state - of - the - art satellites like the @entity62 ( @entity63 ) and ground - based observatories like the @entity20 1 - m @entity65 ( @entity20 )			1
the scientists see regular and massive shifts in the solar ' climate ' , but despite decades of research have until now been unable to understand the physics of coronal rain			1
it turns out that the process through which hot rain forms on the @entity11 is surprisingly similar to how rain happens on @entity12			2
if the conditions in the solar atmosphere are just right , then clouds of hot , dense plasma can naturally cool and condense and eventually fall back to the solar surface as droplets of coronal rain			1
in another parallel with terrestrial weather , the material that makes up the hot rain clouds reaches the corona through a rapid evaporation process			2
but here the evaporation is caused by solar flares , the most powerful explosions in the solar system that are thought to help heat the @entity11 's outer atmosphere			0
the origins of solar coronal heating nonetheless remain one of the longest standing puzzles in solar physics			0
the torrential rain storms , driven by solar flares , may play a fundamental role in controlling the mass cycling of the solar atmosphere and act as a kind of ' solar - scale ' thermostat in regulating the temperature fluctuations of the solar corona			0
dr @entity51 and his team have now developed a new insight into how coronal rain forms			2
together with collaborators in @entity52 and the @entity115 in @entity116 , he suggests a model of ' catastrophic cooling ' , where an exceptionally rapid fall in temperature causes material to change from rarefied coronal gas to ' raindrops '			0
the team used images from the @entity20 based on @entity125 in the @entity126 , a telescope that produces some of the sharpest images of the @entity11 available			0
in june 2012 they observed a giant ' waterfall ' of solar material pouring down from the outer atmosphere of the @entity11 into a dark sunspot on its surface			0
another set of images have been assembled into a movie and show how a solar flare precedes a ' rain shower '			2
dr @entity51 comments : ' showers of ' rain ' and waterfalls on the @entity11 are quite something , though i would n't recommend taking a stroll there anytime soon			0
' but the parallels with weather on @entity12 are both striking and surprising			1

each droplet that makes up a ' coronal rain ' shower is as big as @entity41
plasma rain falls at around 200,000 kilometres an hour
parallels with weather on @entity12 are ' both striking and surprising '
