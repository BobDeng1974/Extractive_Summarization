@entity2 made his official debut for @entity1 in the 3 - 1 reverse at the @entity11 after his four - month ban for biting an opponent expired the day before , but made little impact and was replaced midway through the second half			1
although he was involved in @entity18 's opening goal and almost set up @entity19 to score , it was generally agreed that @entity2 lacked sharpness and he was well marshalled by @entity8 centre backs @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity2 made his @entity1 debut against @entity8 in @entity7 last week , but has been criticised @entity1 boss @entity0 has defended his new striker , and the decision to start playing him immediately some questioned @entity0 's decision to include @entity2 in the starting lineup but the former @entity31 and @entity1 midfielder , who also had a stint at @entity8 , insisted the 27 - year - old was close to peak fitness			1

' we thought that back in the summer when we decided to sign him and we will see that throughout the season			0
' @entity0 took over as @entity1 coach at the end of last term after guiding @entity43 to a ninth - place finish and earning plaudits for an entertaining playing style			1
@entity0 watches @entity19 in training , ahead of a game against his old club @entity43 this weekend @entity57 star @entity18 has started this season in great form for the @entity61 club , who have begun well under new @entity64 coach @entity63 , @entity43 have made a fine start to their latest campaign and are sixth after nine matches , six points behind joint leaders @entity1 and @entity70			1
' it 's a game that is more special to prepare for , ' @entity0 said			2
' it is even a bit strange as i know all their players so well , ' he added			0
' they are a very hard - working team , with a coach who wants them to keep the ball			0
a win for @entity1 on saturday would take them three points ahead of @entity70 at the top of @entity41 ' they do n't take risks , they go after the ball , they pressure you			2
