the team of researchers who caused uproar when they claimed a variety of genetically modified corn causes cancer has insisted the crop ' can not be regarded as safe '			1
leading scientists lined up to condemn the study after it was published two months ago , saying it lacked scientific rigour and had made a series of basic errors			0
@entity14 banned the import of the corn and a group of six @entity19 scientific institutions carried out an investigation which accused the study authors of playing on public fears to hype their own reputations			2
just too perfect ? two @entity25 corncobs ( right ) are compared to @entity27 corn ( left ) grown in @entity28 but @entity19 scientist dr @entity29 and his colleagues have now hit back maintaining the safety of the @entity33 variety of @entity25 corn remains unproven			1
they accused many of their critics of lacking credibility because of links to the @entity25 industry and said much of the criticism was led by ' plant biologists , some developing patents on @entity45 , and from @entity46 owning these products '			1
refusing to give in to demands to withdraw their study , they said their findings represented ' the most detailed test ' of genetically modified crops that are ' independent from the biotech and pesticide companies ' which develop them			0
they said in their rebuttal , published as a letter to the journal @entity60 , that unlike many other scientists involved in researching @entity25 foods they were free from industry influence because they had no intention of ' commercialising a new product '			1
it was also pointed out by the team that the research represented a ' first step ' rather than a final conclusion about the potential impacts of @entity33 corn and that further experiments may be able to establish its safety			1
for their original study they carried out experiments on rats and concluded that the @entity25 corn , developed by @entity81 biotech company @entity46 , increased the risks of breast cancer and liver and kidney damage			1
controversial : the introduction of @entity25 foods to our shops has been met with horror by some consumers experiments carried out by the team also suggested that tiny quantities of the widely available weedkiller roundup , also developed by @entity46 , was also associated with an increased risk of cancer			1
the experiments were carried out over two years whereas , they pointed out , biotech companies have usually based claims that their @entity25 products are safe after feeding new varieties to rats for 90 days			2
after publication of the study , in the peer reviewed @entity60 , a dozen senior scientists signed a letter to the journal saying it should never have been published			0
@entity25 food and feed is strictly regulated within the @entity111			2
labels must indicate to consumers when @entity25 ingredients are included in food all products that are @entity25 or include @entity25 ingredients must meet traceability rules so that all retailers are able to identify their suppliers			2
risk assessments for all new @entity25 products are carried out by the @entity121 before they can be sold in @entity122 ' this study does not provide sound evidence to support its claims			1
indeed , the flaws in the study are so obvious that the paper should never have passed review , ' they wrote			0
' this appears to be a case of blatant misrepresentation and misinterpretation of data to advance an @entity137 agenda by an investigator with a clear vested interest			0
' the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) ordered a @entity19 university to carry out a review of the research while in @entity14 the @entity143 was asked to conduct a similar exercise			0
@entity46 said in a statement in september : ' based on our initial review , we do not believe the study presents information that would justify any change in @entity121 ’s views on the safety of genetically modified corn products or alter their approval status for genetically modified imports			0
' read the rebuttal by dr @entity157 and his colleagues .			0

study found rats eating @entity25 corn @entity33 suffered *higher* risk of *tumours*
researchers hit back at critics who they suggest are too close to industry
