one direction : @entity1 was meant to pick up a friend at the station in @entity4 , but took a wrong turn and ended up 900 miles away in @entity6 a @entity8 woman took an astonishing 1,800 mile detour through six countries after her car navigation system went wrong			1
@entity1 , 67 , had intended to drive to @entity4 from her home in @entity13 to pick up a friend from the train station - a journey of just 38 miles			1
but she took a catastrophic wrong turn and eventually ended up 900 miles away in @entity6 , @entity18			1
despite crossing five borders and seeing multiple - language traffic signs , she did not stop to question her sat - nav until two days later when she realised that she may not be in @entity8 any more			1
although she stopped to refuel her car several times , ms @entity1 did not think her @entity23 could be leading her down the wrong path			2
‘ i saw all kinds of traffic signs			0
first in @entity27 , then in @entity29 - @entity28 , @entity30 , @entity31 , ’ she told a @entity8 news website			1
‘ but i did n't ask myself any questions			0
i was just distracted , so i kept my foot down , ’ she added			0
police believe she crossed through @entity35 , @entity29 , @entity36 and @entity37 before finally getting to @entity18			2
then she faced another 900 mile journey back to get to her home in @entity13			0
by this stage her worried son had reported her missing to police			0
officers searched her house and were about to launch a full scale manhunt when she phoned home to say she was in @entity6			2
she told police : ‘ i did n't really notice anything was wrong until i suddenly arrived in @entity6 and realised that i was no longer in @entity8			1
’ long journey : police believe ms @entity1 's @entity23 led her from @entity8 through @entity35 , @entity29 , @entity36 and @entity37 through to @entity18 when asked if she did not find the length of the journey - or the change in language - strange , ms @entity1 replied : ‘ maybe , but i was just preoccupied			1
' ' i did n't really notice anything was wrong until i suddenly arrived in @entity6 and realised that i was no longer in @entity8 ' @entity1 so preoccupied that even after being forced to stop for petrol several times - as well as a snooze on the side of the road - ms @entity1 still did not question her satnav			1
' i stopped several times for petrol and paid with my credit card			0
when i felt tired i stopped for a few hours sleep in the car on a lay - by , ' she said			0
' i was a bit absent - minded as i had a few things to think about , i suppose			0
' ms @entity1 finally made it home 60 hours after embarking upon her inadvertent odyssey			0
a spokesman for police in @entity8 , who had been on the brink of launching a hunt for ms @entity1 after being alerted by her son , said : ' this is an incredible story			2
' these gps systems cause problems from time to time but nothing like this			0
but this woman has done nothing wrong and we just have to believe her , ' he added			2
detour : following her satnav led ms @entity1 from her home in @entity88 , @entity8 ( left ) , all the way to the @entity18 capital @entity6 ( right ) , almost 900 miles away			1
