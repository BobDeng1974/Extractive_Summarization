these brightly coloured fish have been photographed happily operating an underwater car wash to help clean passing sea turtles			1
photographer @entity3 , 43 , described the fish as working ' like a car wash ' and said the electric yellow , purple and blue fish worked enthusiastically on each turtle that checked in for a scrub			1
