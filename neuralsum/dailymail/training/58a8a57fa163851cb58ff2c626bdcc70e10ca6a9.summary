different year same old problems for @entity1 as 2015 opened amid the sort of defensive chaos which has become an unwelcome trademark of @entity6 's team			1
@entity7 was the chief culprit by the @entity9 , directly responsible for both goals , as @entity11 strengthened their grip on a place in the top - four with a deserved victory			1
@entity7 abandoned his goal with a mindless charge for the first which was quite magnificently converted from a tight angle by @entity20 and , for the second , the keeper toed the ball straight to @entity23 in another manic moment			1

click here to see more from our brilliant @entity94 @entity68 described @entity23 's strike as a ' @entity98 gift ' and , after conceding it , @entity7 reached for his water bottle and took a long swig , perhaps wishing it contained something stronger			1
' it 's unfortunate but i do n't want to make too much of it today , ' said @entity6 , although he did confirm back - up keeper @entity107 would start in the @entity109 tie against @entity110 on sunday			2
this had always been the plan , apparently			0
@entity7 might be grateful for the mental break from keeping goal behind a team which folded to surrender a three - goal lead against @entity117 in the @entity118 and again to concede a late equaliser at @entity120 last month			1
@entity80 , played up front in the absence of @entity122 and @entity123 , tries to escape the attentions of @entity125 @entity126 , deployed in a holding midfield role against his former club , tries to stop a cross from @entity54 @entity76 started in the @entity1 midfield for the second game in a row , and battles with @entity11 's @entity56 injuries and instability have not helped but the mishaps at @entity11 came with a first - choice back four in position - and the defeat could easily have been heavier			1
@entity60 dominated @entity72 throughout the game			0
twice @entity60 hit the woodwork and was also thwarted by a goal - line clearance by @entity69 after @entity23 had intercepted an under - hit @entity72 back - pass which left @entity7 scrambling around on his hands and knees yet again			1
@entity11 's midfield were too strong for @entity76 and @entity126 , the inexperienced pair who did not perform badly but lacked the authority and confidence to convert possession into quick and efficient service for the front four			0
@entity1 offered very little beyond a 10 - minute flurry at the end and the ever - impressive menace of @entity80 – and yet they had clear chances at key moments which might have changed the game 's outcome			1
it was still goalless when @entity78 set up @entity79 , who was unmarked in front of goal but unable to angle his effort away from @entity49 , who pushed it clear			0
early in the second half , the @entity11 keeper made an even better save , low to his left , to deny @entity80 an equaliser			2
' the defence was outstanding and @entity49 made great saves , ' purred @entity68 , after reinforcing his team 's unexpected position inside the top four			0
at the other end of the pitch , @entity7 's goal was under attack from the opening minutes when @entity60 beat @entity72 in the air to reach a cross from @entity23 and nod it against the post			1
moments later , the big @entity180 striker outfoxed @entity72 again but his effort was blocked			0
@entity69 beats @entity56 to the ball and puts a cross in but @entity1 failed to create many chances at @entity184 's @entity185 holds off @entity77 during a first half that lacked quality with the exception of @entity20 's well - taken goal @entity7 storms out of his goal to confront @entity20 , before getting caught out of position for the @entity11 ' first goal @entity7 , whose rush of blood left @entity1 exposed for the goal , looks on as @entity27 lies on the floor disappointed this was @entity69 ’s first defeat in 13 games as an @entity1 player			1
@entity11 took the lead 11 minutes before half - time			2
@entity20 displayed terrific pace and determination to evade @entity72 and win the race to a long pass from @entity206 , which had inexplicably also lured @entity7 out of his goal			1
from where he collected the pass , wide on the right , @entity20 checked the ball onto his left foot , ignored the calls from @entity60 in the centre , and took aim with a curling shot which just evaded the outstretched leg of @entity27 as he raced back towards his own goal			2
it was a delightful , precision finish , tarnished somewhat when @entity20 's right knee seemed to buckle under a mob of jubilant team - mates			2
the @entity223 forward tried to continue but had to be replaced before half - time by @entity59			0
' he was in too much pain , ' said @entity68			0
' we had to change him but we do n't know exactly what is wrong , or if he will be available for the sunday in the @entity109 or for the @entity229 for his country			0
' in the few minutes while playing on lame , @entity20 still managed to create a chance for @entity232 to extend the lead , but @entity7 went some way towards making amends for his earlier mistake by blocking the low drive with his feet			2
the @entity11 goalscorer had to go off soon after opening the scoring , picking up an injury in his celebration @entity80 is crowded out as @entity23 and @entity54 combine to tackle the @entity243 forward , who was frustrated by the home defence @entity80 gets a shot away but @entity49 was equal to everything @entity1 could throw at him in the @entity11 goal the approach for @entity11 's second was much like the first with a long pass into the channel between left back @entity73 and centre half @entity72			1
it was delivered on this occasion by @entity258 and expertly brought under control by @entity125 , who then applied a second touch even better than his first by rolling an inviting low cross into the @entity1 goalmouth			0
@entity55 might as well have rolled a live grenade across the turf , the way panic descended			0
@entity69 cut out the cross but dropped the ball dead in front of goal and froze as @entity271 blundered in , attempting to clear but only stabbing a pass to @entity23 , who scored			2
@entity60 hit the woodwork again , beating @entity72 at the near post to another fine cross from @entity54 on the left , and @entity206 smashed the rebound over			0
@entity60 holds off @entity74 and @entity76 as @entity11 extended their lead over the @entity279 in the @entity281 table @entity69 clears acrobatically for the @entity279 but the visitors were undone by defensive errors during the disappointing defeat @entity69 then cleared off his own line before @entity1 summoned their too - little - too - late finish			1
@entity80 charged forward and drew a foul from @entity52 , which could easily have been interpreted by referee @entity89 as a denial of a clear goal - scoring opportunity			0
@entity52 got lucky , took a yellow card and @entity80 glanced the top of the net from the free - kick			0
' it was a definite red card , ' said @entity6			0
' only the referee can explain why he did not give it			0
' this decision was not , however , the reason for @entity1 's fifth defeat of the @entity281 campaign or the reason why they have ground to make up to extend their 17 - year run in the @entity118			2
@entity23 runs to the fans after scoring @entity11 's second goal , which came after @entity7 had prodded the ball into his path @entity80 's free kick , which landed on the roof of the net , was the closest @entity1 came to scoring in a really poor performance			1

@entity20 finishes well after @entity7 makes poor decision to charge out of his goal
@entity23 makes it 2 - 0 after a second error from the @entity1 *goalkeeper* in the second half
fan runs to the *dugout* to confront @entity6 after poor @entity279 performance
@entity11 move three points clear of @entity1 in fourth place in the @entity328
