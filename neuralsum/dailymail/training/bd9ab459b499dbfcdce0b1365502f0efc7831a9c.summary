this fearless adventurer appears so relaxed while dangling precariously above a waterfall that he 's even able to have a lie down			0
@entity3 carefully inches his way along a 100ft - long slackline as water from the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , gushes past him below			1
he has to ensure the loud noise from the plunging water surrounding him does n't detract from his intense concentration			0
@entity3 somehow manages to lie down on the slackline suspended 30ft above the @entity7 , appearing relaxed as he does so he inches his way carefully across the 100ft slackline as he prepares to perform the incredible stunt , seemingly without a care in the world but the daredevil ca n't retain his balance forever and ends up having to dive into the water 30ft below after slipping off the wire but as the daredevil appears to stop for a spot of meditation on his back , somehow managing to balance amid the spray and the din from the water , his poise finally deserts him and he has to dive into the spectacular pool 30ft below			1
the amazing moment was captured by keen snapper @entity35 , 30			1
he said : ' being in such a beautiful location certainly makes slacklining very tranquil and meditative			2
' however the challenge of walking over water and very close to the waterfall creates a lot of visual distraction and movement			0
' this can make it a lot harder to maintain balance and composure , especially since there 's mist in the air			0
@entity52 photographer @entity35 , 30 , captured this series of incredible images of @entity3 in action high above the churning water the adventurer appears totally unperturbed by the spray and the loud noise of the gushing water around him as he balances on the wire @entity3 had to get himself into position to perform the lie down which is no mean feat in itself , having to creep carefully across the 100ft wire the slackline is in a canyon with many different geological layers of conglomerate rock and sandstone surrounding the churning river @entity71 describes the spot as one of his favourite slacklining locations in the world , and often protects it by not telling people where it is ' the scenery is constantly moving with water so it 's difficult to focus , which makes @entity3 's skills that much more honed and impressive			1
' the slackline is in a canyon of many different geological layers of conglomerate rock and sandstone			2
@entity71 added : ' the cliff band changes as you get deeper into the canyon			2
' with the river cutting through the landscape it has formed this incredible waterfall and cliff jumping location			0
' the scenery is breath - taking and full of all sorts of different species of bird , deer and other wildlife wondering around freely			0
' it 's one of my favourite slacklining locations in the world			1
' i do n't often divulge the exact location in order to protect the area from being overdeveloped and polluted			1

@entity3 can be seen carefully inching his way along the 100ft - long line before lying down down on the wire
but then his poise finally deserts him and he plunges into the waters of the @entity7 in @entity8 , 30ft below
the amazing moment was captured by snapper @entity35 , 30 , at the stunning canyon in the north west @entity9
it is one of his favourite slacklining spots in the world , so he *rarely* divulges its exact location in order to protect it
