for a panel debating tax issues , economist @entity0 ought to be the perfect candidate			1
instead , @entity6 bosses chose fashion blogger @entity7 , 25 , and mr @entity0 ’s junior female colleague , @entity8 – all in the name of gender equality			1
yesterday mr @entity0 , 54 , a chartered accountant and the head researcher at the @entity12 , branded the decision to leave him off the programme as ‘ straightforward discrimination ’			1
mr @entity0 said @entity6 researchers contacted him while preparing thursday ’s programme , on corporation tax , because they wanted to use some of his extensive studies on tax avoidance by major companies			1
but when he offered to appear on the panel he was told it would not be possible because it would ‘ upset the gender balance ’			2
instead , he had to sit at home and watch miss @entity8 talk about his own research			0
to make matters worse , alongside her was @entity24 , an economics graduate and founder of the ‘ what i wore today ’ website			0
it features daily shots of her in outfits including plunging tops , bikinis , and , once , a @entity55 bunny costume			0
before thursday ’s show , she tweeted that she was heading to the studio straight from a waxing salon , joking that she was going from ‘ waxes to taxes ... i feel very legally blonde			2
’ she added : ‘ whenever i do n’t know the answer i ’ll just refer people to my amazing “ specially threaded for @entity6 ” brows			1
’ in the event @entity24 appeared a little nervous on air , giving composed if slightly rambling answers when asked by presenter @entity68 whether it was wrong for major firms to pay comparatively small amounts of tax			2
snubbed : @entity0 says he was discriminated against for being a man the two women were joined by @entity22 , head of tax policy at accountancy firm @entity76			1
before the debate , mr @entity68 interviewed treasury minister @entity78			2
according to mr @entity0 , the show ’s researchers told him he could n’t appear because mr @entity22 had been chosen to put the multinationals ’ view and , due to the @entity4 ’s strict ‘ gender balance ’ rules , they needed a woman – miss @entity8 – to put the opposing argument			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it ’s an utterly absurd situation where @entity6 will overlook a story about paedophilia but obsess about gender balance rules			1
‘ they were so desperate to have a woman they took someone less expert over someone more expert , and the person who had done the investigation and developed the techniques was deliberately not allowed on air			0
’ ‘ we are a tiny campaign			0
i do all the work – there ’s no credible alternative to talk about this kind of investigation			0
‘ @entity8 did quite a good job but she ’s not an accountant			0
she just talked about my work			0
’ miss @entity7 , a graduate of @entity113 , said she was also surprised by the decision not to invite mr @entity0 on the programme and said she had not been told about the selection criteria			1
she added : ‘ if he was willing to be on it and was n’t invited it was a bit mean			0
i was having a bit of a laugh with my friends about being on it			0
‘ there are certainly opportunities that i get for being a young businesswoman that young businessmen do n’t get			2
‘ i believe you should get the best person for the job , whoever that is			0
on a programme like @entity6 it should be the best person to speak on the subject			1
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 aims to have a varying range of voices			1
we contacted mr @entity0 to see if he could recommend other experts in this field to broaden the discussion			1
‘ we are sorry if he was disappointed not to have been asked to appear in this particular programme			0
’ the show focused on how the 19 biggest firms in @entity147 were paying as little as 3 per cent tax			2
experts estimate the @entity150 is missing out on £ 3.3billion in potential revenue .			0

@entity0 *claims* he has been discriminated against by @entity4 's @entity6
he was ' snubbed ' for the show 's debate on corporate tax over a younger female colleague
@entity7 , 25 , says she was chosen to tick the ' young , female ' box
