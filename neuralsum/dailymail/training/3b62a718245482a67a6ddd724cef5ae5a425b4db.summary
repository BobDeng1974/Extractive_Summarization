@entity1 's mayor @entity0 is famous for his ability to make people laugh but it would seem that he is n't the only @entity6 politician with a ready sense of humour			0
home secretary @entity9 also knows more than a thing or two about raising a smile - a talent she demonstrated for the benefit of a local police officer while waiting for the @entity15 outside a @entity17 school this morning			1
according to onlookers , a smiling mrs may chatted happily to a local policeman before treating him to a series of amusing facial expressions , among them a grimace and an eye - roll , and staring up at the heavens with a smile			0
the entertainer : the home secretary treated a police officer to an amusing series of grimaces as she waited for the @entity15 to arrive sense of humour : mrs may rolls her eyes towards the heavens - much to the delight of police officers and dignitaries all smiles : the home secretary had stopped joking by the time the @entity15 arrived and swept her a curtsey instead when the monarch arrived , mrs may , who was resplendent in a grey tweed suit and a pair of her favourite leopard print kitten heels , opted for a big smile and a curtsey and put jokes aside as she accompanied the royal couple on a tour of free school , @entity56			1
the @entity15 herself was elegant in a pretty pale pink ensemble , complete with one of her trademark @entity61 handbags , and was all smiles as she was welcomed to the school by headmaster , @entity65			2
joined by the @entity66 , the @entity15 was treated to a tour of the school , including a peep at lessons , the science laboratory and one of the boarding houses			1
once inside , the @entity15 joked about the proliferation of satellite navigation ahead of old fashioned map reading after joining a group of students studying geography			2
as the children crouched over maps following co-ordinates , the @entity15 watched intently and chatted to @entity82 , aged 11			0
he explained they had been set the task of finding a point on the map and the @entity15 joked : ' nowadays you probably have a sat - nav or something '			0
@entity90 to see you : mrs may also showed off a pair of her trademark leopard print kitten heels and a neatly tailored tweed suit much better : mrs may clearly enjoyed her encounter with the @entity15 and was left wreathed in smiles after the monarch moved away @entity100 : the @entity66 was on cheerful form but the @entity15 looked pensive as she prepared to meet @entity103 students pretty : the @entity15 was ravishing in a pretty pale pink ensemble and accessorised the outfit with a triple string of pearls one of the growing number of free schools , @entity56 is an all - ability , co-educational day and boarding school for students aged 11 to 19 , which opened this september			1
nearby @entity113 , which counts the @entity114 and prince @entity115 among alumni , is the new institution ’s educational sponsor and has helped to shape the school in the years leading up to its opening by taking a leading role on its governing body			2
pupils are able to use some of the facilities at the world famous college , particularly for sports activities , and @entity113 students volunteer at @entity103 helping their peers in a range of areas , especially with homework			0
the annual fees for children boarding at the school , 55 in total , are just over £ 11,000 a year			0
during the visit the @entity66 , who is known for his quips , could not resist making a joke about an elevator which slowly carried the royal couple to a first floor dormitory beeping as it went			2
he said to laughter from senior college staff : ' how did you manage to get an antique lift into the building ? ' @entity15 , meanwhile , chatted to a group of boys who told her their bedrooms were just along the corridor and she joked ' no excuses for being late '			0
top form : the @entity66 and the @entity15 toured @entity56 , a @entity17 free school sponsored by @entity113 very nice : the @entity15 was handed a posy made up of pale pink roses and purple lilies as she entered the school hero : the queen was introduced to @entity162 's @entity161 , sir @entity163 , 105 , as well as children from the school ( right ) what 's up there ? the queen is momentarily distracted while being introduced to a line of @entity56 pupils taking a tumble : the @entity66 looks impressed as he watches a young gymnast in action the visit comes hot on the heels of a row about private schools and the state sector , sparked by a column written by @entity181 's shadow education secretary @entity180 in which he threatened to strip the fee - paying sector of tax breaks worth £ 700m			1
writing in the @entity184 , mr @entity180 , who is himself privately educated , said private schools have not done enough to support state establishments and must do more if they wish to keep the tax break			1
' the next government will say to them : step up and play your part , ' said mr @entity180			0
because the time you could expect something for nothing is over			0
' the resulting row saw independent schools and conservative politicians hit back at mr @entity180 , who also opposes free schools , accusing him of fomenting class war and acting in a ' bigoted ' manner			1
@entity201 , headteacher of mr @entity180 's old school the independent @entity203 , said @entity181 should be considering ' new , helpful initiatives ' to raise standards in state schools instead of trying to ' tastelessly quantify ' the value of public benefit his former school generates each year			1
in a statement , mr @entity201 said : ' if the shadow education secretary were to visit his old school , what would he find ? a diverse pupil population from all creeds and backgrounds , with £ 1 million per annum granted for fee assistance , the vast majority for 100 per cent bursaries			2
' indeed , if mr @entity180 wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that @entity203 generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that @entity203 receives through its charitable status			0
' rather than rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector , is n't it time for @entity181 to come up with some new , helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry ? ' inspection : the @entity15 joined pupils for lessons as well as touring the dormitories and refectory can i join in ? during this geography lesson , the @entity15 joked about the popularity of sat - nav and the decline of maps what 's in there ? the @entity15 peers through a microscope during a tour of the school 's state - of - the - art science labs sporty : pupils studying at @entity103 can also use the sporting facilities at @entity113 , which sponsors the @entity17 free school well - wishers : the royal couple were greeted outside the school by a cheering crowd that included this adorable young well - wisher			1

her *majesty* was also introduced to ' @entity162 's @entity161 ' , sir @entity163 , 105
