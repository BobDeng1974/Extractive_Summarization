@entity0 , who promised that if @entity2 win the election , they would freeze energy bills for 20 months @entity0 plan to freeze energy prices is putting firms off cutting household bills before the election , experts say			1
the @entity12 firms have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers as the crude oil price has plummeted , dipping below 50 dollars a barrel this week compared with 115 last june			1
@entity18 has warned energy firms and airlines to cut their prices			2
some estimates suggest families should have seen average annual bills fall by £ 140 due to tumbling wholesale prices			1
but analysts now believe that @entity2 ’s promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months if they win office – to fix the ‘ broken energy market ’ – may be keeping prices high			1
@entity32 , founder of @entity33 , said energy firms buy their supplies up to two years in advance so can not pass on savings immediately , but the price freeze is also a big factor			2
he said : ‘ the risk is that by the time the energy firms are able to buy cheaply , we get towards the election in may			2
if there ’s a @entity2 government and they bring in the price freeze , the suppliers run the risk that they will be locked into those prices for 20 months , even if wholesale costs go up			1
it ’s a disincentive for them to cut prices			0
‘ @entity2 ’s policy has become a big factor in the price decisions energy companies are making			2
i ’m neutral , and i do n’t think freezing prices is a bad policy , but @entity2 should n’t have announced it in advance , as it allows the energy firms to game the system			1
‘ they are far more wary of cutting prices than they would have been , in the short - term			0
i ca n’t see the energy firms cutting prices before the election			1
’ a senior source at one @entity12 firm said : ‘ i would n’t completely rule out a cut in prices before the election , but the threat of the price freeze makes it a lot more difficult			1
‘ household bills are not just affected by wholesale prices , but also network costs , which are rising , and government policies such as smart meters			1
the price freeze gives us a fourth consideration			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s policy , announced at his party conference in 2013 was seen as a game changer for the @entity2 and polls show it is backed by voters			0
he claimed it would save households £ 120 each per year on a typical dual fuel deal , and that business would be £ 1,800 better off			0
the @entity12 firms have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers as the crude oil price has plummeted @entity94 , a utilities analyst at @entity95 said the election and also the competition inquiry into the energy market ordered by ministers which reports later this year , are holding up price cuts			1
‘ the price freeze is a damp squib for gas bills , because of falling wholesale prices			2
if it happens – the energy companies will just make money ’ , he said			0
‘ there is leeway for energy firms to cut gas bills now , but i do n’t think it will happen in 2015			0
but only gas – there is no leeway to electricity bills , on which energy firms are looking to make a loss this year because of the carbon taxes and green policies			0
’ @entity121 , @entity122 at @entity123 added : ‘ in most respects , it ’s a completely unworkable policy [ the price freeze ] ’ , he said			0
‘ it would be an unprecedented intervention by the government and it ’s difficult to see how it would be implemented			0

experts say firms are *n't* cutting household bills before the election
say it is down to @entity2 promise to freeze prices if they win office
some estimates say families should have seen bills fall by £ 140
comes as the price of crude oil had plummeted to below *$* 50 a barrel
