by @entity0 and @entity1 even before they took their seats for her show last night , mothers and their young daughters were left in no doubt about what @entity9 had in store for them			1
dozens of explicit images displaying the controversial star ’s body parts had been branded on to clothing , bags and underwear and displayed on merchandise stalls ready for the fans , some as young as six			1
and once @entity23 did appear on stage – via a long , pink slide designed to resemble her tongue – things only got more shocking			2

during her rendition of her godmother @entity61 ’s son @entity62 , towards the end of her set , she shouted the c - word , before telling fans : ‘ this is @entity43 , y’all can say c * * * here			1
’ she also simulated an orgy on a bed with six male and female dancers , before asking the audience if they were as slutty as her @entity70 fans			2
she then urged people to ‘ make out ’ with the person next to them , the ‘ dirtier the better ’ , before projecting images of her young fans passionately kissing onto a giant screen			1
later she spat bottled water onto the front row			0
not too worried : @entity79 , 37 , from @entity80 , @entity81 , took her eight - year - old daughter @entity82 and said her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery controversial from start : this merchandise stand featuring @entity9 in a series of explicit photographs with parental advisory and censoring signs met parents and their young children when they arrived at the @entity30 for the show she has n't changed : @entity9 performs provocative moves onstage at @entity31 's @entity96 arena some parents said they had taken their children to the concert on a school night after giving in to pressure from them			1

@entity79 , 37 , from @entity80 , @entity81 , took her eight - year - old daughter @entity82 and said that although the show was ‘ likely to be shocking ’ , her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery			1
she said : ‘ to her licking a hammer is just licking a hammer			0
plus a lot of these young girls loved @entity9 as @entity118			1
‘ i think she thinks her transformation is a bit weird but sex and shocking stunts like @entity9 ’s are all over the internet and news so children are much more unshockable now			2
’ ego show : miss @entity9 simulated an orgy , talked about watching pornography , asked the audience of mostly young girls if they were ' slutty ' , urged the crowd to ' make out ' with each other and joked about drinking , smoking and taking drugs they were warned : @entity9 has the phrase ' @entity156 ' projected onto the stage party hard : there was no trace of @entity118 in her performance bad role model : @entity9 made several references to taking drugs , including saying her band was ' stoned ' and asking the audience to take pills @entity167 , 41 , from @entity168 , north @entity31 , who brought her nine - year - old daughter @entity170 , said she felt ‘ conflicted ’			1
‘ i work in the entertainment industry so i understand what she ’s doing somewhat			0
she ’s young and pushing boundaries			0
but would i want my daughter acting like that and dressing like some of the fans here ? absolutely not			2
‘ though i would n’t want my child to behave like @entity9 i do n’t want my child to judge either and i do n’t think it ’s wrong for them to experience new and unusual things			2
‘ it develops their character and it ’s not good to have too much censoring			0
’ @entity187 , 38 , from @entity188 , @entity189 , took his 11 - year - old daughter			1
he said : ‘ it ’s not my cup of tea , but she wanted to come			0
it ’s going to be a late night and it ’s a shame , but she ’s promised to be good in school			0
’ but @entity196 , 37 , from @entity197 , said she had not wanted to bring her six - year - old @entity198 , but had eventually caved in to her daughter ’s pleas			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t think @entity9 is a very good role model			2
i do n’t like the idea of them selling suggestive underwear either			0
‘ the show will probably be very shocking , i ’ll probably have to cover @entity198 ’s eyes			2
some of the girls here are dressed very indecently			0
i would not want my daughter dressed like that at her age			2
