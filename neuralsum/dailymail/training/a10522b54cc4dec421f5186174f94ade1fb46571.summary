wrecked : police and firefighters arrived at the scene in @entity27 , near @entity28 , @entity29 to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame today @entity24 said the suspect who was arrested near the scene of the crash was being held at a police station after also escaping injury			1
they are investigating whether the car was driven at the house deliberately and then set on fire afterwards - or whether the vehicle caught fire as a result of the impact			1
an officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire			1
the remains of the front wall were piled up in front of the lounge window which had been shattered by the force of the impact			1
one neighbour said : ' it was about 7am when i heard a loud bang and i went out to see what happened from my front door			2
i could see the car had collided with the wall and there was smoke and flames everywhere			2
crime scene : an officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire ' the next thing we knew was there were police everywhere and a police helicopter flying around			1
if one of those kiddies had been in the front room we could have been looking at a fatality			2
' another neighbour said : ' there was a large bang and i came out and saw flames coming out of the front window			2
quite a few people came out too			0
' i only moved here in november last year and knew that a woman lived there with three kids and partner			0
they must have only recently split up because i thought i ’d seen them together			0
' i ’d never heard anything untowards coming from the house or an shouting or disturbances			2
the children are all very small , i think two are a nursery and one at primary school			0
' a police spokesman said : ' shortly after 7.05am on tuesday 24 july 2012 , police were called to @entity121 in @entity27 following a report that a car had collided with the front of a house			1
' police officers and firefighters attended and found that a @entity12 had collided with the house and was on fire			0
' three children and a woman were inside the house at the time of the incident but were not injured			1
a joint investigation is being carried out by police and @entity137 to look into the circumstances surrounding the fire			0
' ' a 37 - year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken into police custody for questioning			0
' roads were closed temporarily whilst forensic officers examined the scene			0
the incident occurred after @entity10 who runs his own design and architect practice campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter @entity153 - then aged two years old - was knocked down by a car outside their home in september 2010			1
she survived the impact and made a full recovery but mr @entity10 collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £ 500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area			1
as a result mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road last year			0
in an interview with his local paper @entity10 said : ' i get really emotional when i talk about what happened to @entity153 , and i am just so glad she is still here			2
' i want to thank everyone who is supporting me			0
the roads will be a lot safer if people are reminded about the 30mph speed limit and how to spot it			0
' on roads that have a lot of pedestrians and houses on each side , children can just run out into the road like my daughter did			0
' if the driver is doing more than 30 mph , it can be difficult for them to stop and there can be a serious accident			0
' @entity10 set up @entity192 and @entity193 pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages instead about his work designing loft and garage conversions			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
