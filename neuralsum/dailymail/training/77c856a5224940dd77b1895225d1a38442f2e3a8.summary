published : 12:35 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 16 september 2013 police have launched an investigation into claims that a woman who was held at an immigration removal centre was subject to inappropriate sexual behaviour from guards			1
the 23 - year - old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at @entity10 in @entity11 , which her lawyer said could amount to misconduct in public office			1
@entity14 of law firm @entity15 urged the government to investigate and said consent could be an issue in the matter			1
the 23 - year - old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at @entity10 in @entity11 ms @entity14 said the alleged case , involving a @entity23 woman who was released from the centre last march , was not an isolated one			1
' the government needs to look at what the hell is going on at @entity10 , that this could happen in such a widespread abuse , ' she said			1
' it 's not a one - off			1
they need to investigate the whole system there , because it has not worked			1
' she said the issue was whether individuals being detained at the centre were capable of giving consent , adding : ' the problem is that it is not an environment where they are making free choices at all			1
' if an officer conducts himself way outside the permitted rules of behaviour , that may amount to another offence of misconduct in public office , whether it was consensual or not , even if it is not an assault			2
ms @entity14 described the women at the centre as highly vulnerable , and said : ' these women are generally quite scared to come forward , and often they have moved or been deported before they are able to say anything			1
how widespread it is is difficult to know			2
' @entity58 , which runs the centre , has denied there is a widespread issue at @entity10 she added : ' this is precisely the kind of case the government says they are gong to remove legal aid from			1
it is a classic example of the government saying they are saving money but actually , they 're removing challenges to the abuse of state powers			2
' @entity58 , which runs the centre , has denied there is a widespread issue at @entity10			1
@entity78 , @entity58 's director at the 400 - bed centre near @entity80 , @entity11 , said : ' @entity58 absolutely refutes the allegations made that there is an environment at @entity10 where sexual intimidation or inappropriate behaviour is in any way tolerated			1
' we have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints and they are always fully investigated			2
' we expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our staff and any claims of misconduct are treated extremely seriously			2
on the occasion when an complaint of sexually inappropriate behaviour between staff and a resident was brought to our attention in 2012 the matter was properly investigated and the police were kept fully informed throughout			2
as a result three members of staff were dismissed			0
' a @entity107 spokeswoman said : ' we received a report at the end of august from a third party			0
no one has been arrested in connection with this investigation , but the investigation is ongoing			0
' shadow home secretary @entity115 described the allegations as ' extremely serious and disturbing '			0
she said : ' a full and thorough investigation into these specific charges of abuse must be undertaken by the police and the @entity121 immediately and testimony taken from all involved			0
this kind of alleged abuse is a serious criminal offence and should be treated as such			0
' the @entity121 needs to tell us whether and how long it has known of these allegations and what action it has taken to bring the police in			0
' and the independent @entity130 inspectorate needs to review urgently the operation of outsourced centres run by private contractors such as @entity58 and look at the handling of allegations of abuse			1
' staff are supposed to be trained to identify if people may have been trafficked or subject to abuse so they can be given support and help			0
that 's why allegations that staff have themselves perpetuated abuse are so disturbing , and why it is so important to get to the truth			0
' a @entity121 spokesman said : ' we take the welfare of our detainees very seriously			0
detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls , but it is vital that these are carried out with humanity and dignity , and we are committed to ensuring that this is the case			0
' we expect contractors to maintain the highest standards			0
any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and , if necessary , they will be reported to the appropriate authorities , including the police			0
' we operate a comprehensive complaints system for detainees who feel that they have not been treated in accordance with our published operating standards			0
