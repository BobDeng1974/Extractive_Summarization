@entity0 will attempt to tame a monster of his own creation on saturday , but fears talents such as @entity4 will remain rare so long as clubs and fans apply fickle judgements to their homegrown players			1
the @entity10 manager was instrumental in his 10 years at @entity11 in the rise and breakthrough of @entity4 , but on friday recalled the sort of attitudes that mean the 24 - goal striker remains something of an exception in this country			1
‘ we played him towards the end of the season last year and the fans were n't having him , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ they were trying to get the galacticos on the pitch			0
we stuck to our guns and got a lot of flak for it			0
@entity4 battles with @entity32 during @entity11 's clash with @entity34 on wednesday night @entity0 says that he is not surprised by @entity4 's remarkable rise to prominence at @entity11 @entity4 breaks away from the challenge of @entity38 during the @entity40 final at @entity41 last week ‘ clubs have to stick their necks out to get @entity45 players playing in the @entity46 , and getting them judged in the same way as players who cost a lot of money and do n't produce			1
’ in @entity4 ’s case , the bravery of @entity52 and @entity53 , his @entity55 successor , has been central to the 21 - year - old proving he can thrive in the higher reaches of the @entity46			2
the same can be said of players such as @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , who have all excelled at times this season			2
but @entity0 added : ‘ i know quite a lot of @entity11 fans			1
i used to tell them about the players coming in			2
i said to a friend of mine that @entity59 is probably the best footballer at the club			0
@entity0 ( right ) was part of @entity52 's backroom staff when @entity4 broke through to the first team many @entity11 fans were unhappy when @entity4 began to play in the first team ( he is pictured on his debut in august 2011 ) but @entity0 says they stuck with him and were rewarded football data analysts @entity75 predict that a @entity11 win at @entity10 is the most likely outcome on saturday ‘ they do n’t know what goes on in the background and they were like , “ we need this person from this country and we need that guy from that country ”			1
to @entity11 's credit and the manager 's ( @entity53 ) credit , he has come in and has been very brave			2
all credit to him for being very unbiased to expensive players and actually seeing the players who are on form			0
‘ what normally happens is a player will go in , not do very well on their first game and then you will never see that player again			0
and then people will go and buy a player who is similar , who can play 10 bad games and the fans or the people will say , “ oh , he ’s got to get used to the @entity46 ”			0
‘ why should a player that £ 20m be given more favour than the player that comes from down the road and cost less money ? that ’s one of the biggest problems we have in this country			0

@entity0 was at @entity11 before *joining* @entity10
he was part of the backroom staff when @entity4 broke into first team
now at @entity10 , @entity0 says he is not surprised by @entity4 's rise to fame
he revealed that some @entity11 fans were not happy when @entity4 was given his chance in the first team , instead calling for experienced players
