by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 25 july 2013 city dwellers could soon propel themselves through rush hour with just few kicks on a fat - wheeled scooter			1
described by the makers as a riding experience similar to ‘ going surfing or snowboarding through the city ’ , the @entity5 can zoom through the streets at 2mph to 15mph			1
the design is a cross between a child 's scooter , a @entity14 , and a bike and lets the rider stand or sit			1
it does n’t require a helmet or a licence to operate			2
they claim it takes only about three hours to charge the battery with the standard charger each time the rider kicks the ground , an intelligent impulse drive provides electric power support augmenting the amount of physical force the foot has pushed off the ground with			1
the impulse drive kicks in automatically when a speed of 2mph or greater is reached			2
the engine is a direct drive motor integrated into the rear wheel rim , which means that there are no gear belts , linkages or any other additional elements that could break			2
each time the rider kicks the ground , an intelligent impulse drive provides electric power support augmenting the amount of physical force the foot has pushed off the ground with founder @entity53 describes the invention as ' a completely new vehicle category '			0
he added that one of the biggest challenges during the development of the @entity5 was the frame geometry weight : 28kg capacity : 125kg engine 250w/1000w hub motor performance : @entity65 / @entity64 battery : li - ion battery management system charging : 1 - 3 hours depending on the charger speed : up to 25km/15mph range : up to 35km/22 miles @entity72 : range up to 55km/34miles according to the makers , a @entity76 company of the same name , while riding in @entity23 mode , one battery charge will last an estimated 25 days in the city environment			1
they claim it takes only about three hours to charge the battery with the standard charger			1
the group believe that traffic congestion can not be solved by @entity86 alone			0
instead , @entity5 aims to be more intelligent by moving riders through urban areas efficiently , saving time in covering short distances			1
founder @entity53 describes the invention as ‘ a completely new vehicle category ’			0
‘ you can ride it at 6mph , a perfect pace to manoeuvre through pedestrian - filled sidewalks , but feel free to race cyclists on bike paths at a maximum speed of up to 15mph , ’ said @entity53			1
@entity53 added that one of the biggest challenges during the development of the @entity5 was the frame geometry			1
the frame consists of two parts			0
each half is formed from one piece by a process called ' free - form @entity108 '			0
the design is a cross between a child 's scooter , a @entity14 , and a bike and lets the rider stand or sit			1
it does n't require a helmet or a licence to operate the stability is generated through the short successive radii and a high - strength aluminium alloy			0
in total the frame weights around 6lbs			0
having just landed a crowd - funded investment of $ 120,000 , the @entity76 group hopes to soon produce the vehicle for the mass market			0
the group is currently perfecting the electronics of the progressive impulse drive electric motor while finalising manufacturing logistics			0
the design has just been nominated in the category " mobility " for the @entity134 2013 , which honours pioneers who are committed to a more environmentally conscious future			2
video : in march 2012 , @entity53 and his team embarked upon the @entity140 project which has evolved from an idea into a fully functional riding prototype			0
this video takes a look at the final design			2

@entity5 can zoom through the streets at 2mph to 15mph
the design is a cross between a child 's scooter , a @entity14 , and a bike
one battery charge , which takes three hours , can last around 25 days
