by @entity0 the chancellor in @entity2 on monday : he has vowed to spend billions on a ' @entity3 ' to give an economic boost to @entity5 and @entity6 @entity7 says it is better to spend public money on transport links in the @entity11 than continuing to fund so many people on welfare			1
the chancellor yesterday pledged billions to fund a ‘ @entity3 ’ to prevent cities such as @entity5 and @entity6 from lagging behind @entity16 and the south			1
he said that although the plans could cost as much as £ 15billion , the benefits that would accrue in terms of prosperity would be better than spending so much on benefits			0
mr @entity7 said that if the gdp of the north of @entity26 was brought up to the @entity28 average , it would be worth an extra £ 56billion to the northern economy over the next 18 years – the equivalent of £ 1,600 per household			1
he told the @entity32 ’s today programme that governments should not have to choose between investing in the north or the south of the country			0
‘ i hope we do n’t have to make a choice between the two , ’ he said			2
‘ i think the real choice in our country is actually spending money on this big economic infrastructure , trans - @entity46 rail links , @entity48 2 in @entity16 and the like , and spending money on , for example , welfare payments which are not generating either a real economic return and at the same time , are trapping people in poverty			0
’ at an event in @entity5 , he backed a report by the leaders of the cities of @entity59 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity60 and @entity61 who call for £ 15billion of investment to improve road and rail links			1
the chancellor described cost in the @entity68 as ‘ affordable ’ – and that is was necessary to make it easier to travel between the cities to enable them to compete with @entity16			1
the report said that if adopted , the 15 - year investment plan , which complements the @entity76 proposals , could deliver benefits for the whole of the @entity11 including up to 150 per cent additional capacity on roads and as much as 55 per cent quicker journey times on a faster , more frequent interconnected rail network			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ of course £ 15billion is a lot of money – it ’s about the size of the @entity48 project in @entity16			1
‘ it ’s a project over a number of years , out to 2030			0
we have got a £ 100 billion capital budget to the end of the decade			0
i think this kind of proposal is affordable			0
’ mr @entity7 has said he wants to build a ‘ northern powerhouse ’ around the major cities of the @entity11 , whose legacy of heavy industry has led to an economic performance lagging behind the rest of the @entity28			1
the chancellor also said that this autumn there will be new proposals on transferring more power and a bigger say over how money is spent , from @entity108 , to the cities and regions in a ‘ new model of city governance ’			2
he added : ‘ i ’m prepared to roll up my sleeves and get it done , so let ’s get on with it ’			0
mr @entity7 said if the @entity118 and the cities could get the economic performance of the @entity11 to match the rest of the @entity28 , it would add billions to the wealth of the nation and ‘ rebalance ’ the economy from an over-reliance on the @entity125 , @entity16 and the @entity126			1
@entity48 construction workers on the @entity129 tunnel below the @entity130 in east @entity16 : public spending on infrastructure is £ 5,312 per person in @entity16 but in the @entity135 it is only £ 420 per person the one north plans also include increased road capacity for both freight and personal travel through extended motorways , improving links to ports and airports and fast and frequent intercity rail links , all interconnected with @entity76 , the super-fast @entity147 rail project from @entity16			2
@entity149 spokeswoman @entity148 said : ‘ only @entity149 will properly back our city and county regions with ambitious plans to devolve more funding and economic power to them			0
‘ mr @entity7 will be judged on his actions , not his words			1
he is failing to back the @entity159 report or @entity149 ’s plans to devolve billions of pounds of funding			0
’ figures from the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) show the @entity11 has fared badly in terms of investment in the past			2
@entity167 , director of @entity168 , said planned spending of public money on transport infrastructure in the @entity172 was £ 5,312 per person in @entity16 but in the @entity135 it was £ 420 per person and the @entity175 just £ 157 per person .			0

bringing the @entity11 *'s* gdp up to @entity28 average could boost economy by £ 56bn
the improvements could help northern cities compete better with the @entity147
mr @entity7 has *previously* said he wants to build a ‘ @entity186 powerhouse ’
