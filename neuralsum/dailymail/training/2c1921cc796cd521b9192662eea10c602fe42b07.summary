by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 13:38 est , 3 january 2014 from cracking the @entity5 enigma code to eavesdropping on @entity7 communications , the @entity3 code breakers contributed to some of the biggest @entity10 victories of the @entity11 but until relatively recently , much of the codebreakers ' work remained shrouded in mystery - and the role of women most of all			1
now @entity22 drama @entity20 is set to shine a light on the contribution of the 9,000 women who worked at @entity3 during @entity11 , although as historian and author @entity26 explains , fact , in this instance , is even more fascinating than fiction			1
drama : @entity22 's @entity20 is set to shine a light on the contribution of the 9,000 women who worked at @entity3 during @entity11 the real heroines : women played a key part in code - breaking that led to @entity10 victories ' women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes - the highest level of work you could do at @entity3 , ' he explains			1
among the women working at the highest level was @entity49 , a londoner who arrived at @entity3 aged just 19 years old , and who died last november at the age of 92			1
' she was one of the top codebreakers at @entity53 , ' explains @entity26			0
' she 's frequently described as one of the leading female codebreakers but i do n't think that 's fair – she was one of the leading codebreakers full stop			2
' working closely with @entity60 , at the time one of the world 's top experts in ciphers , she was instrumental in unearthing the intelligence that helped @entity66 to a spectacular naval victory over the @entity68 at @entity69			2
but her greatest triumph came in december 1941 when she deciphered a message sent from @entity72 to @entity73 that allowed @entity60 and his team to decrypt the output of the @entity76 [ @entity5 secret service ] enigma machine			2
vital work : women played a variety of roles from lowly clerks to operating machines and breaking into ciphers and codes thanks to @entity49 and @entity60 , @entity66 intelligence was able to monitor @entity76 activities and even plant false information – something that would later prove crucial to the success of @entity92			1
it could even , as @entity26 points out , have helped prevent nuclear war in @entity95			0
' the key thing in all of this is that [ decrypting @entity98 ] allowed @entity92 to go ahead , ' he reveals			2
' without it , it might well have been put back two years			0
@entity103 in mind , this was at a time when the @entity66 and @entity105 were developing the atomic bomb which was later used on @entity7			0
' it 's not at all clear they would n't have used it on @entity5 if they thought it necessary			0
' despite the heroic efforts of @entity49 and fellow code breakers such as @entity114 and @entity115 , the work of female code breakers was n't always given the recognition it deserved at the time			1
' in the 1940s and 50s , ordinary life meant getting married , having children but never again having the sort of life they had at @entity53 ' although there was what @entity26 describes as a ' collegiate atmosphere ' and women were free to challenge their male colleagues as they saw fit , they were paid a third less than the men and after the war ended , many melted back into ordinary life			1
by the 1950s , when the new series of @entity20 begins , most had become mothers and housewives - @entity49 among them			1
sadly , of the 9,000 women who worked at @entity3 during @entity11 , just 600 went on to join the fledgling @entity141 or other branches of the secret services			1
' these women had to really play down their amazing abilities , their strengths and minds , ' reveals actress @entity148 who plays former code breaker @entity149			2
' they had to pretend they had n't done anything special in the war and that means @entity149 has to downplay her intelligence			0
she is upholding the @entity156			0
' back to reality : of the 9,000 women who worked at @entity3 during @entity11 , just 600 went on to join the fledgling @entity141 or other branches of the secret services groundbreaking : but the work of female codebreakers was n't always given the recognition it deserved at the time			1
' unless they went on into @entity141 , most of the women went back into ordinary life , ' explains @entity26			1
' it became a brief thing that did n't reflect their ordinary lives			1
it meant most of them had more life experience , cultural interests and so on than they might have done			0
' but in the 1940s and 50s , ordinary life meant getting married , having children but never again having the sort of life they had at @entity53			0
' and it was n't only the women who missed the fascinating life they had enjoyed while working at @entity3			1
' one of great @entity105 who worked at @entity53 was @entity185 , who later became a senior policy advisor to president @entity187 , ' adds @entity26			0
' he once said nothing he did post-war matched up to what he did at @entity3			2
if he can say that , just imagine what it was like for an ordinary housewife			0
' it 's astonishing how people could do something so extraordinary for five years and then go back to being ordinary			1
' ordinary their later lives might have been but nothing can detract from the incredible contribution made by the 9,000 women who spent the war years at @entity3			1
the @entity20 starts on monday at 9pm on @entity22 until recently , the work of the men and women who worked at @entity3 in @entity206 was a well - kept secret			1
but thanks to the declassification of wartime documents , the exploits of the code breakers – and the magnificent contribution they made – have finally been given the recognition they deserve			2
the story of @entity3 began in late 1938 when a group of @entity220 operatives decamped to the house for a shooting party			2
museum : the house has now been taken over by the @entity225 among them were men from an organisation called the @entity141 ( @entity229 ) whose job it was to assess the @entity234 building 's suitability for becoming the headquarters of a secret group of top level code breakers			1
it was deemed ideal and by september 1939 , @entity229 , the forerunner of @entity141 , returned to start their work in earnest			0
by the end of 1940 , 12,000 people worked at @entity53 and its sub-camps , whether as cooks and support staff or as code breakers decrypting the military codes and ciphers that secured @entity5 , @entity7 , and other @entity252 nation 's communications			0
others operated the incredibly sophisticated machines that were the forerunners of modern computers , including the @entity256 , and the groundbreaking colossus machine			0
by the end of the war , @entity229 ' code breaking expertise had become a key part of intelligence operations and had helped bring @entity11 to a close			0
sadly , @entity3 itself was eventually deemed surplus to requirements with operations later moved to @entity268			0
abandoned by @entity141 , the house passed through several owners , including @entity271 , but by the 1990s was practically derelict and at risk of demolition			0
the buildings were rescued , after the site was declared a conservation area by @entity278 council in 1992 and taken over by the @entity225 which has since turned the building into a museum dedicated to the exploits of the men and women who helped @entity66 and its allies			0

@entity3 codebreakers contributed to biggest @entity10 victories
much of the codebreakers ' work remained shrouded in mystery till recently
@entity22 's @entity20 will shine a light on contribution of 9,000 women
among them working at the highest level was @entity49
she deciphered a message that led to cracking @entity98 code
after the war women had to go back to ordinary lives as housewives
