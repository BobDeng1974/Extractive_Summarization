for the first time , @entity0 has tested one of the explosively powerful boosters that will help its space launch system rocket reach space in 2019 , and eventually take humans to @entity7			1
the 126 - second static - fire test took place in @entity10 today at 11:30am edt ( 3:30pm gmt )			1
temperatures reached 2,500 ° @entity12 ) - enough to melt sand on the site into glass - as 3.6 million pounds of thrust poured out of the engine			1
that static - fire test ( seen in the animation above ) took place at 3:30pm gmt and lasted 126 seconds			1
the 3.6 million pounds of thrust produced temperatures of 2,500 ° c. when @entity21 eventually flies , two of these boosters will be used this was the first test of the redesigned booster for @entity21			1
when it ultimately flies , it will use two of these @entity34 ( @entity34 )			0
there will be two versions of the rocket			0
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity21 will stand 321ft ( 98 metres ) tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			2
towering a staggering 384ft ( 117 metres ) tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			2
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
in its final configuration the @entity21 will be the most powerful rocket ever launched , more powerful even than the @entity53 rocket that took men to the moon			2
during the test , flames exited the nozzle at about @entity59			0
the booster itself is an upgraded version of the same one that took the @entity64 into orbit , but it has an additional section to allow more fuel , and thus more power , to be added			0
known as @entity70 1 , the booster spent several days inside a chamber as it was heated up to a core temperature of 32 ° @entity73 )			0
it measures 117 ft ( 54 metres ) in length , 12.2ft ( 3.7 metres ) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons			0
the rocket is seen left getting ready to fire its engine , before it kicks in to gear ( right ) , providing nearby spectators with an incredible view for two minutes the booster is an upgraded version of the same one that took the @entity64 into orbit , but it has an additional section to allow more fuel , and thus more power , to be added known as @entity70 1 , the booster ( shown ) spent several days inside a chamber as it was heated up to a core temperature of 32 ° @entity73 )			2
it measures 117 ft ( 54 metres ) in length , 12.2ft ( 3.7 metres ) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons shown are engineers at @entity102 preparing to test the largest , most powerful booster ever built for @entity0 's new rocket , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , which fired up for a ground test today at @entity102 ’ test facilities in @entity106 , @entity10 the test was run by @entity0 in tandem with the rocket propulsion company @entity102			1
former astronaut and vice president for advanced strategic programs at @entity102 @entity112 said after the event that it was a ‘ really nice result ’			0
he added : ‘ it looked really clean and was very exciting			0
you could see the pressure coming off the motor			0
’ @entity0 's booster manager @entity118 added : ' we could n't be happier with what we know so far			0
today was about as successful as you can get ' towering a staggering 384ft ( 117 metres ) tall , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds when it eventually takes flight			1
it will be used to take astronauts to @entity7 sometime in the 2030s , with @entity0 ’s @entity129 spacecraft being carried on top			1
