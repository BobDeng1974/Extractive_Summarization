up to 4,000 good - natured travelling football fans transformed the @entity11 landmark into a blistering cauldron of @entity14 jingoism			1
but there was disappointment in the evening for the supporters when their team lost 3 - 2 in @entity11 , with @entity4 debutant @entity19 scoring the winner			1
brandishing inflatable swords , @entity56 flags and ginger wigs , many chanted ‘ there ’s only one @entity27 ’ to the sound of bagpipes			1
just hours before the celebrations began stern - faced local council officials insisted that the square ’s alcohol ban would remain in place			2
but any plans to enforce it were quickly abandoned as a throng of @entity14 appeared on the horizon before most pubs had even opened bearing crates of lager and cider			0
by the time kick - off arrived , the square was a ruin , the ground carpeted with smashed bottles , squashed cans and abandoned bags			2
its famous fountains were left hidden beneath foam after the water was filled with washing up liquid			0
aftermath : rubbish left behind by @entity14 football fans at @entity7 in @entity88 , after they partied all day ahead of their game against @entity4 and filled the fountains with washing up liquid upset : dejection for a lone @entity31 fan at full time after watching his side lose 3 - 2 to @entity4 at @entity5 ah well : a @entity31 fan faces up to defeat in the stands during the international friendly at @entity5 the first ‘ @entity99 ’ clash for 14 years was peppered with politics , as some took the opportunity to campaign for devolution			1
one @entity56 flag was emblazoned with the words ‘ general @entity107 ’s @entity106 ’ , a reference to the hardcore hooligan elements of some @entity111 clubs			1
' we are passionate and we like to party ' @entity113 , @entity31 fan other fans stuck posters bearing the word ‘ yes ’ in a bright blue font on two of the four lions that guard the square			1
their efforts were part of the fervent pro-independence campaign , backed by @entity107 ’s @entity124			0
but there could be no greater advert for @entity14 pride than the mass of up to 25,000 sports fans who travelled south of the border for the anniversary match			1
a sure fire symbol that something is unusual in @entity11 comes when black cab drivers slow down to take pictures with their iphones			2
couple : fans arrive at @entity5 ahead of a friendly match between @entity4 and @entity31 in @entity11 cheering them on : @entity31 fans show support for their team outside @entity5 before kick - off yesterday team : @entity145 and @entity146 of @entity147 show support for @entity31 at @entity5 yesterday , there was a queue of cabbies gazing in astonishment at the heaving number of @entity14 in @entity7			1
' @entity154 is ours ! @entity154 is ours ! you 've got @entity157 , but @entity154 is ours ! ' @entity14 chant they began to arrive shortly after 9am and by noon , the fountains were full of bare - chested men and the bagpipers in full flow			2
as the day wore on the fans became more sunburnt and less inhibited as they danced the conga and performed chaotic @entity166 waves			2
@entity14 flags were draped across statues and one group even attempted to inflate a small castle as footballs bounced above the crowd			2
as a bagpipe player entertained the crowd , one group of fans sang : ‘ @entity154 is ours ! @entity154 is ours ! you ’ve got @entity157 , but @entity154 is ours ! ’ bagpipes : @entity14 football fans gather in @entity7 ahead of the international friendly match taking over : @entity14 football fans enjoy themselves in @entity7 , @entity88 , ahead of the match up for it : @entity31 football fans outside @entity182 before the international friendly others chanted ‘ there ’s only one @entity27 ’ , a reference to the 13th century @entity14 warrior , portrayed by @entity189 in @entity190 , who led the @entity14 in the @entity191 against king edward i of england			1
amid the sea of blue and white , one presumably lost schoolboy unfurled an @entity4 flag next to one of the @entity7 ’s statues			1
he quickly pulled it down when it triggered a mass chant of ‘ what the f * * * * * * hell is that ? ’ from a sea of astonished faces			0
' it all comes out at an event like this			0
and you ca n’t blame us			0
we 've certainly been waiting a long time for it ' @entity212 , @entity31 fan sporting a traditional @entity215 hat , oil worker @entity212 , from @entity213 , said the singing was good natured			2

the ugly scenes which erupted when 100,000 @entity261 fans descended on @entity262 for the @entity264 cup final in 2008 remain fresh in their minds			0
