by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 26 july 2013 the birth of @entity2 earlier saw advertising firms spring into action as they rushed a succession of humorous ads onto billboards up and down the country			1
among them were @entity10 , temporarily renamed ' @entity11 ' and bakers @entity13 , which produced a cheeky ad that showed a bun being removed from an oven by a pair of @entity19 gloved hands and quipped : ' one 's bun is done '			0
but as these hilarious examples show , the birth of the royal baby is n't the only event to have inspired an ad			2
like his nephew , prince @entity28 has inspired some - though he probably wo n't want to dwell on the news behind them			1
prince @entity28 ’s birthday - suit shenanigans in @entity34 made international headlines			1
here , an alluring scent takes the blame for our royal lothario 's behaviour while things were tense at diplomatic and government level , @entity41 chose to unveil a mischievous take on @entity46 's arms initiative many honeymoons are likely to be booked by default of same sex marriage being legalised , @entity48 's cheery ad was quick to capitalise on this the media circus around the split of @entity54 and @entity55 presented a pun that this cruise liner could n't resist following @entity60 's disappointing exit from @entity61 , these advertisers felt the fans might need cheering up , and what better than catching some sun the never ending cycle of @entity66 's managers was the butt of the joke following the return of former manager @entity70 the now - infamous strip billiards game in @entity34 resulted in a succession of ads courtesy of the @entity34 tourist board , which followed up with one aimed at @entity2 this week which read : ' see you in 21 years '			1
another ad inspired by @entity28 's birthday suit shenanigans was created by deodorant brand @entity80			1
referencing the brand 's ' @entity83 ' , the strapline read : ' @entity85 ... if it had anything to do with us			0
' other brilliant ads that made the most of the news include @entity93 's famous @entity92 ad after the defender missed a penalty and sent @entity60 crashing out of @entity96			2
@entity97 followed suit when @entity60 's disappointing form at @entity61 ended in ignominious defeat , releasing an ad that read : ' tears dry faster in the sun. make @entity60 's exit easier to deal with			0
where are you going ? @entity107 is another travel company that 's no stranger to newsjacking			2
after @entity54 left @entity55 , it could n't resist a tongue - in - cheek campaign with a strapline that read : ' hey @entity54 , here 's a cruise you wo n't want to leave ! ' a double whammy riding the wave of @entity117 excitement in august 2012 and also having a joke at the spectacular pr stunt fail by @entity120 @entity121 went ' @entity122 - mad ' last year and there was much talk about his mod sideburns - what better time to promote a facial hair grooming product an ad by agency @entity130 saying what we all thought when enjoying our day off for @entity134 and prince @entity136 's wedding the nation rejoiced in the crowning of @entity139 as @entity141 champion just this month			1
this celebratory ad echoed everyone 's thoughts not quite reactive but clever nonetheless - @entity145 's ' no b * * * * cks ' approach demonstrated its thorough knowledge of prevailing regional attitudes while the horse - meat scandal in spring turned the stomach of a nation , there 's nothing wrong with lots of horse - power in a car mps'expenses have been the an insult to @entity121 taxpayers in recent years - this sharp - tongued ad rides the wave of discontent the images have been collated by advertising agency @entity166 which also runs a website , trendjacking , com , that contains an archive of newsjacking ads. ' brands can demonstrate that they ’re culturally relevant by tapping into the news agenda , ' revealed @entity166 's innovation director , @entity173			1
' by riding on the hype of current affairs brands can become part of the news			0
' people have become great at ignoring traditional advertising			0
clever advertising increasing turns to borrowed relevance , known as newsjacking or trendjacking			0
' ask any comedian and they 'll tell you that timing is everything , but in marketing , you need timing and relevance and a good brand fit			0
you have to get this balance right or potentially face a backlash or worse , be ignored			0
' the bigger the news story , the greater the payoff			0
most trendjacking ads fail to make any impact , but the good ones become part of the story for years to come			2
' other brands to have capitalised on memorable news include @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity145 , @entity48 and @entity205			2
but the award for the most entertaining ad of all probably has to go to @entity208			0
the ad , carried on the back of the company 's coaches , read : ' so cheap even an mp would n't claim it back : a month 's unlimited travel between @entity216 and @entity217 for as little as £ 3 per day '			1
few frustrated voters could fail to raise a smile at that			0
her death made it clearer than ever that you either loved @entity225 , or hated her ; rather like this iconic condiment another ad capitalising on the birth of @entity2 , @entity228 's clever concept makes it raise a smile when @entity233 went up , and down , from space in october 2012 , the whole world was watching and in awe			1
- here ’s @entity237 doing the same a simple , clever and very cheeky execution from @entity239 following president @entity240 losing the election to @entity242 in 2009 after @entity117 organisers displayed @entity46 flag , not @entity245 , @entity205 offered a witty explanation @entity93 had to hang his head in shame following hid decisive penalty miss in @entity60 's @entity96			1
luckily is @entity250 were soon able to make a joke out of it and this ad was @entity92 's most successful campaign to date			2

the birth of @entity2 has resulted in a slew of spoof ads for everything from *nappies* to air travel
companies have *cashed* in on everything from the expenses scandal to prince @entity28 's shenanigans in @entity34
among the *funniest* is @entity145 's clever campaign that mocks @entity271 ' *pretentious* ' *chalice* ' ads
even @entity46 *dictator* , @entity273 , is told to get a good body so he wo n't need such a big ' missile '
