@entity0 will look to extend @entity2 's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career			1
@entity5 confirmed on thursday that the @entity6 international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage , but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery			1
@entity2 has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months , not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments , and his position at @entity16 could be regarded as vulnerable , particularly as @entity0 will rekindle their long - standing interest in @entity18 in the summer			1
@entity0 midfielder @entity2 will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal @entity0 manager @entity5 expects @entity2 to return to pre-season in the best possible shape @entity18 , who has spent the season on loan at @entity25 , will become a free agent in july when his @entity28 contract expires and , given they have worked together before at @entity30 , he is a player @entity5 will consider recruiting			1
but @entity5 has moved to assure @entity2 he has a place in his plans			1
the 27 - year - old was signed by @entity35 in january 2012 and has 12 months remaining on his current deal but his manager is already looking at his situation			2
' this injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long - term injury but it 's something we 'll look at in the summer , ' said @entity5			1
' i 've been very pleased with @entity2			1
coming back from that sort of injury you do n't reach 100 per cent for a long time			1
@entity0 will look to extend @entity2 's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback @entity5 has moved to assure @entity2 he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in @entity18 ' but when he 's been on the pitch , he 's performed really well			1
from the @entity56 game , all his performances have been really influential			2
though he 's now injured , he 's been able to show his worth and for me he is an important player that we want here for the future			0
' we are going to see him			0
but i 'm not too worried			0
it is a tricky injury because if you do n't heal it properly , it could come back			2
we need to make sure he is 100 per cent			0
if he is fully fit for pre-season , that would be fantastic			2
we do n't have another player like him in the squad			0
' we are trying to support him			0
he can add that calm feeling , he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding			0
but it is tough , i wo n't lie			0
it is devastating for him			0
we just have to look at the positive that he does n't need surgery			0
at one point , it looked very likely			0
' @entity18 is a target of @entity5 and with his @entity28 contract running out a move could happen @entity18 played under @entity5 at @entity30 , on loan from @entity28 , and has been at @entity89 this season having won their last three matches against @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity0 have put together their best sequence of results in the @entity97 for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap			1
there is no chance , however , of them qualifying for @entity102 next season but @entity5 does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected			1
he feels the club 's progress over the last four years means they are strong enough to withstand this disappointment			0
@entity0 have put together their best sequence of results in the @entity97 in over a year @entity5 does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of @entity114 football ' within football when you face an opposition losing or winning does n't affect players , ' said @entity5			1
' it 's how you lose and i think every player who 's faced @entity0 this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club			1
' we do n't rely on 10 months of results , we 've got a bigger picture of what we 're trying to achieve and what we 've got in the squad , particularly in terms of the younger players who have been given incredible roles			0
so i think the perception of @entity0 has improved in the last 12 months			2
' we know the positions that we need to strengthen in the summer			2
it 's something we 've worked really hard on since january in order to identify those targets but a lot of decisions will depend on how we perform in the last seven games			0
it 's going to be a very important end of season for us			2
' @entity5 says he has ' got a bigger picture ' of @entity0 's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results			1

@entity2 has been ruled out for the rest of the season with injury
@entity2 has a metatarsal *problem* but will be back for pre-season
@entity5 wants to extend his contract despite *repeated* injuries
@entity0 will likely rekindle interest in @entity18 in the summer
