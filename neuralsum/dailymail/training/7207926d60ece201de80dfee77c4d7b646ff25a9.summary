mobile phone firms are warned today they will be forced to allow customers to swap freely between rival networks unless they end the scandal of blackspots afflicting a fifth of the country			2
culture secretary @entity7 revealed he favoured a system of ' national roaming ' to eliminate poor signals that leave millions unable to make calls			1
he also said the government will provide £ 150 million to fund ' hundreds ' of new mobile phone masts providing coverage to the most rural areas			1
culture secretary @entity7 , pictured checking his mobile as he arrived at the @entity17 on friday , said not being able to get a signal should be part of the modern world in an interview with the @entity22 ahead of the @entity24 ' annual conference , which starts this weekend in @entity25 , mr @entity7 said he backed campaigners who complain that in parts of the country telephone reception is worse than in @entity29 and @entity30			1
' when we first started using mobiles 25 years or so ago , it was a luxury			0
but today , the idea that you ca n't use a mobile to have a conversation wherever you are in the @entity38 is not part of the modern world			0
' i see this as a national utility that we should all be able to use			0
it 's not just about lifestyle , it 's absolutely vital for a modern economy , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' in the @entity38 , at a national level , we do n't have roaming			2
so a @entity48 person coming to @entity49 gets a better signal that someone does as a local			0
it is such a big problem that something needs to be done			0
' mr @entity7 said so - called ' not spots ' , where there is no signal at all , were mostly in remote , rural communities			1
' for that , we 're starting a specific programme with £ 150 million of government money , ' he said			1
' we 'll get a third party to put up masts in those areas and mobile operators have committed to plug into that			1
' obviously , they have to go through the planning process , but we are talking about hundreds of masts and we want to get moving quickly			1
unless we get the hardware up , we wo n't see any improvement			0
' the second issue is partial not - spots , where one provider might provide a signal , but others do n't			2
you might be able to make a call if you 're on @entity78 but someone on @entity80 ca n't			2
' in terms of numbers of people that are affected , it 's a bigger problem – about 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography			0
' i 've experienced it in my constituency in @entity92 , which has some very rural parts			2
i share people 's frustration			0
' i have been pushing a potential solution , which is the idea of national roaming			2
when you go to @entity101 , when you switch on your phone it will roam and find the nearest signal and lock onto it			2
' it 's a software change , not a hardware change			0
obviously the mobile phone companies already implement a system of roaming for international customers			1
the concept is n't new			0
' mobile phone firms could be forced to share their masts so customers can latch on to any signal , regardless of whether it is their provider 's the @entity115 said he had discussed the proposal with industry regulator @entity117 , who had ' made it clear to me that from a technical point of view , it 's feasible '			1
' from a commercial point of view , this would n't be the first choice of the operators , but @entity117 is telling me that it can be made to work , ' he added			0
' i am just not happy with how the mobile companies have behaved on this			2
i have said to them that unless they can come up with something equally compelling , that will work well and can be done in a reasonable timeframe , i 'm minded to push ahead with this			0
they should know that the government is absolutely serious			2
' unless they come up with something else , then this is my preferred option			0
there are various ways of doing it , whether through regulation or legislation			0
' @entity144 , now a cabinet office minister , attempted to change the law before the last election by introducing a ' right to roam ' @entity149 in the @entity150			0
as well as improving coverage in remote areas , the @entity151 believe that in areas where there are good signals , such as towns and suburbs , roaming would remove the need for duplicated mobile phone masts			1
prime minister @entity161 has voiced his frustration at not being able to make calls to world leaders while on holiday in @entity166 it would mean a phone call is transferred to the nearest mast , even if it is run by a rival company to that the caller is signed up to			1
mobile phone firms have been reluctant to agree to roaming because they have funded the costs of erecting masts themselves , and do not want to share them with rivals			1
prime minister @entity161 is understood to have become increasingly frustrated by dropped calls in his @entity180 constituency – and also in @entity181 , which is a notorious mobile phone blackspot even though it is in the heart of the capital			1
in june he revealed his struggle to keep in touch with world leaders while on holiday in @entity166 , because he could not get a mobile signal			0
the prime minister has been forced to drive to the top of a hill to get a connection on his phone to deal with the fall of @entity194 in @entity195 and the bloody civil war in @entity197			0
mr @entity161 , who holidays in @entity166 every year , said it was ‘ very frustrating ’ that parts of the country were still left in ‘ not - spots ’ without a decent phone signal			1
@entity205 , a former environment minister and @entity207 mp for @entity208 and @entity209 , said he had to ' squat against the sink ' to take phone calls from his office because of poor mobile phone coverage in his constituency .			1
