60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial led by @entity4 scientists @entity5 are to be the first in the world to test a new vaccine against the deadly ebola virus			1
altogether 60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial led by @entity4 scientists			1
if the vaccine performs as well in humans as in monkeys , the trial will be extended to 80 people in @entity17 and in @entity18			1
the entire trial programme is being fast - tracked – subject to ethical approval – with the intention of using the vaccine in people at high risk in @entity25 early next year			1
latest figures show that more than 1,550 people have died from the virus , with more than 3,000 confirmed cases - mostly in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			2
it is the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago and the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) predicts the outbreak will last for many months , affecting at least 20,000 people			2
at present there is no vaccine to prevent the disease and no proven treatment			0
the new vaccine contains a single ebola virus protein from the strain sweeping @entity25 – anyone inoculated with it can not develop the disease itself			1
it is different from the experimental medicine @entity50 being used to treat @entity51 , the first @entity52 to contract the virus while working as a nurse at a remote health centre in @entity32			0
the 29 - year - old is currently in isolation at @entity59 ’s @entity58			2
the new trial will be led by professor @entity61 , of the @entity62 at @entity4 , which has unprecedented experience in carrying out trials using similar types of vaccine			1
he said the speed with which arrangements had been made was unparalleled in 20 years of experience in the field			0
he said : ‘ the tragic events unfolding in @entity25 demand an urgent response			2
‘ in recent years , similar investigational vaccines have safely immunised infants and adults against a range of diseases including malaria , @entity79 and @entity80 ‘ we , and all our partners on this project , are optimistic that this candidate vaccine may prove useful against ebola			0
’ the vaccine is being co-developed by the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) and pharmaceutical giant @entity87 , along with a dual vaccine containing proteins against both @entity25 and @entity90 strains of ebola which is being trialled in the @entity93			1
the @entity5 initiative is backed by a £ 2.8 million grant from the @entity96 , the @entity97 and the @entity5 @entity98			0
the consortium ’s funding will also enable @entity87 to begin manufacturing up to around 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine at the same time as the initial clinical trials			0
each set of volunteers will be split into groups of 20 that will receive different doses of the vaccine so researchers can evaluate the best dose to use in terms of both safety and activity			2
the current @entity125 outbreak in @entity25 could infect more than 20,000 people , the @entity35 has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease			1
the @entity130 health agency issued plans to combat the outbreak in four @entity25 nations - @entity30 , @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity134 - where it said the actual number of cases could already be two to four times higher than the reported 3,069			1
the current death toll stands at 1,552			0
describing plans to tackle the @entity25 outbreak , the @entity35 said : ' this roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two - four fold higher than that currently reported			1
' the deadly @entity25 outbreak that began in @entity30 in march and has since spread to @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity134 , requires a massive and coordinated international response , the @entity35 said			2
it is being tested here and in @entity25 to take account of differences between the different populations that might affect safety or immune response			2
prof @entity61 said successful completion of both stages of the trial in healthy volunteers could mean the vaccine is ready for large - scale use early in 2015			1
he said results from studies in monkeys suggest a good safety profile from the single ebola virus protein , which produced high levels of antibodies and immune - boosting white blood cells			1
as it does not contain infectious virus material , it can not cause a person who is vaccinated to become infected with ebola			0
the duration of response could only be discovered in ‘ real - life ’ situations but even if it only lasted a few months it would be enough to contain outbreaks , he said			0
dr @entity179 , director of the @entity96 , said : ‘ this epidemic has shown how difficult it can be to control ebola			0
‘ how useful drugs and vaccines might be in complementing existing public health interventions can only be assessed in epidemics			0
‘ the initial safety work we ’re announcing today with our international partners will hopefully make that possible during this crisis and for inevitable future epidemics			0
’ chief medical officer , dame @entity192 said she was pleased @entity87 had chosen the @entity5 to apply for the first phase of human testing for the vaccine .			0

60 healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in @entity4 trial
if vaccine performs as well in humans as in monkeys , trial will be extended
entire trial programme is being fast - tracked – subject to ethical approval
hoped vaccine can be used in high - risk people in @entity25 early next year
