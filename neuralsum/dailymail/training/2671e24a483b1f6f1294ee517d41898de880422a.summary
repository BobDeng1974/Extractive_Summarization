in a pair of stunning 1993 memos from the @entity5 , advisers to @entity1 and @entity2 railed against physicians for putting personal greed ahead of ' @entity9 ' medical insurance reform , and wrote that scheduled listening - session meetings with health care stakeholders were political exercises organized purely for show			1
doctors suffer from an ' emotional irrationality ' and a sense that they have a ' " right " to be over-compensated , ' wrote attorney @entity18 to @entity2 and her health care guru @entity19			1
the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity20 released more than 4,000 pages of memos on friday as part of the lengthy process of opening previously secret materials to the public			1
those were the days : the @entity5 reasoned that doctors would only oppose the ' hillarycare ' insurance reform because they were greedy @entity32 is , and was , an antitrust specialist working for @entity22 's @entity34 , which was later implicated in the @entity36 real estate scandal when the @entity37 refused to produce billing records from mrs. @entity2 's tenure at the firm			1
@entity32 wrote of her perception ' that physicians are , on the whole , very agitated about what they perceive to be infringements on their ability to continue to make money which supports them in the lifestyle which they have anticipated and enjoyed over the last few decades			1
her complaint anticipated objections from the @entity54 , which favored antitrust exemptions for any doctors who banded together to cut costs in the wake of new regulatory costs			0
' they believe they are being ( or will be ) sandwiched between managed competition in which they have little power to protect their comfortable income and autonomy , ' @entity32 wrote , ' and increased taxes which will also reduce their spending power			0
' she also seemed to mock health care providers for a sense of entitlement about the income levels that follow years of education , internships and low - paying residencies			1
' their misperceptions about taxes , malpractice reform , managed care , antitrust enforcement and their " right " to be over-compensated must all be addressed as much as possible , ' @entity32 wrote			2
' their remaining emotional irrationality can not , and should not , be addressed by permitting anticompetitive behavior which will undermine the goals of reform			0
' reached at her law office , @entity32 told @entity90 that she was ' sorry that i ca n't be of any help			0
' ' you have caught me on a busy friday afternoon and are asking about something i worked on over 20 years ago , ' she said			0
@entity34 antitrust attorney @entity18 ( @entity97 ) and future labor secretary @entity98 ( r ) wrote frank memos at the outset of the doomed @entity9 effort which today sound callous first lady @entity2 would later move to @entity102 , win a seat in the @entity104 , and become the @entity106 > secretary of state -- and now she 's mulling a run for president in another memo , a staffer who ran the @entity110 – in charge of interfacing with special interest groups – and her assistant , briefed the first lady on a plan to host two days of public hearings about her health care push			1
' the primary goal for this two day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input , ' wrote @entity98 , the future @entity126 , and @entity127			0
' even though our primary goal is political inoculation , ' they counseled , ' we should not lose the opportunity for some public education			2
' ' some testifiers should be average people with horror stories , middle class families worried about the future , and senior citizens			0
these average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching			0
' the @entity22 documents were held back from public view for 12 years after the end of the @entity146 administration , and should have been released a year ago			2
now that they have hit the internet in large batches , @entity147 will likely mine them for material they can use against mrs. @entity2 , who is expected to be the @entity153 standard - bearer in the 2016 presidential election .			2

stunning memos shed light on back - room *cynicism* behind ' @entity9 ' plan in the 1990s
one adviser wrote that doctors only want to ' make money which supports them in the lifestyle which they have anticipated '
another said two days of planned public hearings about health care reform would be just for show , to generate ' political inoculation '
@entity21 is releasing thousands of pages of documents from the 1990s @entity173 just when @entity2 needs *transparency* the least
