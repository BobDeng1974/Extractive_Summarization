a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze will be introduced if the @entity6 win the election			1
@entity8 and media secretary @entity9 is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography amid fears that it is corroding childhood			1
he promised legislation to force distributors to put effective age verification technology in place that would apply to those based in the @entity22 as well as abroad			1
mr @entity9 's pledge is a victory for the @entity41 's long - running @entity40 campaign			1
ministers have already persuaded internet service providers to start contacting all 19million @entity22 households connected to the web and making them choose whether to apply family - friendly filters that block all porn sites			0
in addition , for any new broadband users , a block on pornographic websites is automatically applied by default			0
customers now have to specifically ask for this filter to be removed – or to ' opt in ' – in order to able to access adult material			2
but mr @entity9 said a more radical crackdown was necessary to prevent children freely accessing pornography			1
' even the most attentive and engaged parents can not know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they 're seeing , ' the minister told the @entity41			1
' in 2015 anyone , regardless of their age , is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street			2
' imagine a 12 - year - old - boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a dvd showing graphic , violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women , ' he said			0
' yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images – it 's happening online			1
' mr @entity9 , who is increasingly tipped as a potential future @entity6 leader , cited evidence that viewing hardcore porn can lead to children ' pressuring each other to try out things they 've seen , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos '			1
' it is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – magazines , tv , dvds or video - on - demand content			0
' such protections are taken for granted , and , as the @entity41 has argued for years , it 's time our approach to the online world caught up			1
' mr @entity9 said if the @entity28 win next month ' we will legislate to put online hardcore pornography behind effective age verification controls '			1
' if websites showing adult content do n't have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether , ' he added			1
an independent regulator will oversee the new system and determine how age verification controls will work			1
these are likely to involve similar software in place on gambling websites , which use credit card details or software to check passport details or driving licences to confirm users are over 18			2
mr @entity9 's pledge is a victory for the @entity41 's @entity40 campaign the regulator will also be given the power to require @entity22 service providers to block specific websites identified as distributing hardcore pornography without effective age verification controls in place			1
it will have the power to issue targeted sanctions , including financial penalties			0
mr @entity9 added : ' it is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline			1
if we fail to take action , there is every chance the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ' normal ' by the next generation			1
that is not the sort of society i want to see and certainly not the sort of society i want my children to live in			2
' @entity161 , of the @entity162 , said the group ' warmly welcomed ' the proposals			0
@entity165 , of the @entity166 , said : ' we do n't want children to learn about sex and relationships through the warped lens of adult pornography			1
' this week we warned that ten per cent of children aged 12 and 13 were addicted to porn and one in eight had taken part in a sexually explicit video			2
any action that makes it more difficult for young people to find this material is to be welcomed			0
' it 's time to protect children online by @entity182 , @entity183 , writing exclusively for @entity184 imagine a 12 - year - old - boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a dvd showing graphic , violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women			1
you would , quite rightly , ask whether society should allow such a young mind to view hard - core pornography			2
i ’m sure we ’d all agree that the answer would be an emphatic “ no ”			0
yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images			0
and it ’s happening online			0
the internet has been an amazing force for good in so many ways			0
but it also brings new threats and challenges for us to contend with			0
i ’m a father of four young children and i know all too well that the online world can be a worrying place for mums and dads			1
after all , even the most attentive and engaged parents can not know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they ’re seeing			0
@entity8 and media secretary @entity9 is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography in 2015 anyone , regardless of their age , is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street			1
and allowing young people to access pornography carries alarming consequences both for individuals and for society			1
it can lead to children pressuring each other to try out things they ’ve seen online , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos			1
and it can lead to children having unhealthy attitudes towards sex and relationships			0
it is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world – whether that is magazines , tv programmes , dvds or video - on - demand content			0
such protections are taken for granted , and , as the @entity41 has argued for years , it ’s time our approach to the online world caught up			1
so today we are announcing that , if the @entity6 win the next general election , we will legislate to put online hard - core pornography behind effective age verification controls			1
of course adults should be perfectly free to look at these sites			0
but if websites showing adult content do n’t have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material – they should and will be blocked altogether			1
no sex shop on the high street would be allowed to remain open if it knowingly sold pornography to underage customers , and there is no reason why the internet should be any different			0
an independent regulator will oversee this new system			0
it will determine , in conjunction with websites , how age verification controls will work and how websites that do not put them in place will be blocked			1
one thing is absolutely clear : the @entity6 ’s commitment to child safety online			1
for the past five years we have been working with industry on a voluntary basis , an approach that led to the creation of default - on family filters			0
but filtering is just one way in which we can keep our children safe online			2
now we can – and must – go further to give our children the best start in life			0
there will be some who say that this exercise is futile , that websites and children alike will find ways to get around this law			2
and i agree that there are always people who try to avoid legal restrictions			0
but we must not let the best be the enemy of the good			0
it is right that we act now and do what we can to restrict this content			0
it is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline			0
and it is right that we do everything we can to protect our children			2
if we fail to take action , there is every chance that the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ‘ normal ’ by the next generation			2
that is not the sort of society i want to see and it ’s certainly not the sort of society i want my children to live in			0
over time @entity22 ’s laws have evolved to reflect our most deeply held values and beliefs , and the protection of children has long been a sacrosanct principle at the heart of that			0
i do n’t believe that we should abandon such an important principle simply because the latest threat to our young people comes from a technology that also brings incredible benefits			0
there is a choice at this election , and it is between a party which backs families wants to give children the best start in life , and a chaotic @entity362 with no plan			2
we are clear : adults should and will be free to view legal content , but we would never stand by and allow that 12 - year - old boy to buy hardcore pornography from a sex shop			2
it ’s time to make sure our children are just as well protected online as they are on the high street .			2
