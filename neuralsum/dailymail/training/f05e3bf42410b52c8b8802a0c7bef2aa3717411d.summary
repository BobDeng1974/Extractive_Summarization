by @entity0 published : 02:52 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 13 june 2012 many a @entity2 holidaymaker has rubbed the sleep from their eyes to gaze in bewilderment at the rows of sunloungers requisitioned long before breakfast			1
now research may have solved the mystery of how @entity13 tourists always get their towels there first			1
according to a major study of sleeping habits , they spend less time asleep – and get out of bed more quickly when the alarm goes			0
scroll down for hilarious @entity21 video the @entity21 advert shows a @entity2 holidaymaker expertly throwing his towel onto the sun lounger , beating the @entity13 tourists to reserving the first sunbed while @entity2 sleep for an average of seven hours and 21 minutes each night , our counterparts in @entity13 get by with eight minutes fewer			1
and while we take advantage of the snooze button to get an average of 20 more minutes in bed , they are up and about after just 15			0
professor @entity34 , a neuroscientist at @entity35 , looked at the sleeping habits of more than 10,000 participants from both countries			0
he said his findings may be down to the fact that @entity13 begin to work earlier			1
they usually get to the office at 8.20am , while we are typically at our desks by 8.50am			2
towels down : @entity13 have a natural advantage getting to the sunloungers first because they sleep less , a study has found but while our later starts might cost us a comfortable poolside lounger , there is good news too			1
our sleeping habits are more in tune with our natural body clock , according to professor @entity54 , head of the @entity55 , who contributed to the study			0
he said that we have lower levels of ‘ social jetlag ’ – the difference between our actual sleeping habits and our natural sleep cycle – because our habits ‘ better suit our sleep needs ’			0
professor @entity34 said : ‘ the fact @entity2 are sleeping more and have less social jetlag would promote more creativity			2
in terms of quality wake time at work , this is good news			2
’ @entity13 abroad : but thsi time it 's football fans celebrating the @entity73 championships - at which towels are needed only to dry off the excess beer and without casting aspersions on the ability of the @entity13 to enjoy a joke , sleeping longer may also account for the famous @entity2 sense of humour			1
professor @entity34 said : ‘ sleeping longer is known to help us with memory but also language skills and creativity			0
that includes our sense of humour – our ability to look at the world and laugh is very much influenced by sleep			0

@entity2 *people* sleep for seven hours 21 minutes per night - and the @entity13 sleep for eight minutes less
