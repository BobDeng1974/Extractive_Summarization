this is the moment an adorable baby chimp took his first faltering steps away from his mother			1
his beard and wrinkles belying his tender years , the brave youngster looked a little unsteady on his feet as he determinedly approached the camera in a bid to show off his confidence			1
but his courage soon faded and he fled back to the safety of his family			2
brave explorer : the tiny chimpanzee wobbles slightly as he tries to look tough for the camera growing up : the young animal is clearly keen to become independent , left , but is still deeply reliant on his doting mother , right photographer @entity21 captured the sweet little chimp making his first forays out into the big wide world in the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27			1
the 59 - year - old 's incredible , close - up shots reveal the true depth of the wide - eyed baby 's heart - warming relationship with his family			2
in one photograph , the youthful chimp appears to smile as he is cradled in his devoted mother 's arms			1
in another , he cautiously eyes the camera while sticking close to his parent 's side			2
mr @entity21 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , was delighted to be able to photograph the young chimp from such close quarters			1
he said : ' as soon as the babies reach the age of six months they start to explore and leave the safe body of the mother and climb in the trees			0
nuts to this : @entity21 photographed the little chimp at the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 i 'd kill for a banana : the toddler relaxes with his mother in these rare and revealing close - up shots ' this baby was trying to intimidate me with short attacks , but before it reached me it ran back to mum and showed me grimaces			1
' within six days with the chimps i only had one close encounter with the baby and i was happy to get such nice shots			0
' he added : ' you are lucky to find a female group of chimps and even more if they have a small baby among them			0
' each tourist or photographer has a limited time the apes			0
you are only allowed around an hour per day			0
' the best time to see them is when they 're on the ground			0
if they 're up in the trees , it 's very difficult to photograph them			0
