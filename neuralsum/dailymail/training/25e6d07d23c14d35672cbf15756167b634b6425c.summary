by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 8 october 2013 a new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives , @entity2 experts have said			1
@entity8 , professor of immunology at the @entity10 , said the @entity13 , @entity12 malaria vaccine could have an ‘ enormous ’ public health impact , particularly in @entity15			2
results released today by @entity2 pharmaceutical giant @entity17 ( @entity17 ) showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination			1
a new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives , @entity2 experts have said the firm now plans to submit an application to @entity29 regulators with the hope of getting the vaccine approved - meaning its introduction could be less than two years away			1
over 18 months , the @entity13 , s vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17 - months			1
the study of more than 15,000 babies and young children found the vaccine reduced , by around a quarter , malaria cases in babies aged six to 12 - weeks at first vaccination			1
the youngsters received the jab in three separate doses one month apart			0
during follow - up , their immunity to malaria declined and a sample of the children were given a booster jab			1
experts are now awaiting results of the booster to see if it offered extended protection			0
professor @entity56 said the initial three doses had been shown to deliver between 30 per cent and 50 per cent protection			0
results released today by @entity2 pharmaceutical giant @entity17 showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination ‘ in public health terms , if you could vaccinate every child at risk of malaria you could reduce cases by a third to a half and you could reduce deaths by a third to a half , ’ she said			1
‘ it would have an enormous impact in terms of public health			0
’ professor @entity56 said 200,000 lives a year could be saved worldwide if every at risk child was vaccinated			0
and some 100 million cases a year worldwide could be prevented , mostly in @entity15			0
while it is too early to talk about eradicating the disease entirely , professor @entity56 said combining the malaria vaccine with other measures such as spraying homes with insecticides , using insecticide bed nets and improving drugs for treatment would have a huge impact on the numbers affected			2
over 18 months , the @entity13 , s vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17 - months ( image shows the micro-organisms that cause malaria ) the @entity13 , s vaccine works by triggering the immune system to defend against the malaria parasite when it first enters the bloodstream and / or when the parasite infects liver cells			1
it is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting , maturing and multiplying in the liver			0
professor @entity56 said the jab prevented 90 per cent to 95 per cent of malaria parasites getting into the bloodstream			2
but the remaining 5 per cent to 10 per cent of parasites were still enough to make people sick , which is why the jab does not offer complete protection			0
professor sir @entity114 , from the @entity10 , who is an investigator on the trial , said : ‘ results show that the malaria vaccine @entity13 , s / @entity118 continues to protect vaccinated children during an 18 month follow - up period , preventing many cases of malaria			1
‘ protection declined during the follow up period			0
however , one third of the children in the trial have now received a booster dose of vaccine			2
we will learn next year if this protects these children for a further period			2
’ eleven research centres in seven @entity136 countries are conducting the trial , together with @entity17 and the @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , with grant funding from the @entity141 to @entity139			0
sir @entity142 , chief executive of @entity17 , said : ‘ we 're very encouraged by these latest results , which show that @entity13 , @entity12 continued to provide meaningful protection over 18 months to babies and young children across different regions of @entity15			1
‘ while we have seen some decline in vaccine efficacy over time , the sheer number of children affected by malaria means that the number of cases of the disease the vaccine can help prevent is impressive			1
the @entity141 has provided funding for the vaccine trial which took place in seven @entity136 countries ‘ these data support our decision to submit a regulatory application for the vaccine candidate which , if successful , would bring us a step closer to having an additional tool to fight this deadly disease			0
we are grateful to the scientists across @entity15 and @entity17 and to our partners who have worked tirelessly for almost 30 years to bring us to this point			2
’ dr @entity171 , vice president of product development at @entity138 , said : ‘ given the huge disease burden of malaria among @entity136 children , we can not ignore what these latest results tell us about the potential for @entity13 , @entity12 to have a measurable and significant impact on the health of millions of young children in @entity15			1
‘ while we want to be careful about not getting ahead of the data , this trial continues to show that a malaria vaccine could potentially bring an important additional benefit beyond that provided by the tools already in use			0
’ the results of the trial were published in @entity188 , @entity189			0
the @entity190 ( @entity190 ) has indicated a policy recommendation for the @entity13 , @entity12 vaccine could be possible as early as 2015 if it is approved by @entity29 regulators .			2

the @entity17 jab protects young children for up to 18 months
the vaccine halves the number of malaria cases in babies and *toddlers* and reduces the number of malaria deaths by a third to a half
@entity17 is applying to regulators in the hope of getting the vaccine approved
if it is , it could be introduced for use within the next two years
