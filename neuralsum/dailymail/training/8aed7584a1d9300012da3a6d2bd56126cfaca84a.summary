less a television programme , more a way of life , @entity3 has played a special part in millions of people ’s lives for the past 50 years			1
and , as we celebrate the anniversary of its first programme , it is worth reflecting how a simple but brilliant format then remains a ‘ simply brilliant ’ format now			2
famous face : @entity16 made more than 600 appearances on @entity3 as presenter and analyst from its instantly recognisable theme tune , to its famous cast of presenters , pundits and commentators , it has tracked a remarkable football journey that spans from @entity27 to @entity28			1
the biggest star is the action itself ; the football has always come first , the talking after that , a principle the programme has stuck to down the years			1
and despite wall - to - wall live football , @entity3 remains the most famous brand in televised sport			1
@entity41 episode of @entity3 that 's entertainment : despite the proliferation of live @entity46 football , @entity3 still thrives lucky omen : a black cat runs across the pitch in front of the @entity51 during first game to be shown on @entity3 by the late 1970s i was a starry - eyed assistant producer on the programme			1
on my first saturday , i had a bit of lunch in the @entity58 canteen to settle my ‘ pre-match ’ nerves and found myself sharing a table with carry on star @entity61 and a green and purple alien straight off the dr who set			1
he had egg and chips , then went off to conquer the universe			2
a decade later i was editor of @entity3 , helping drive the programme ’s agenda			1
we strived to provide the first and most informed analysis of the day ’s events			2
on april 15 , 1989 , that desperate day of the @entity74 , i fought to keep our programme in the schedules so we could relay the developing story through our own experienced broadcasters , @entity79 and @entity16 , who had both been there that afternoon			0
i remain proud of that programme but wish it had never needed to be made			0
legend : tv commentator @entity85 covered top matches for over 30 years for the @entity58 where the show ’s football opinions led , others followed			1
and with @entity79 , the incomparable @entity16 , freshly retired @entity92 and future star presenter , @entity93 , in the pundits ’ chairs , life was never dull			0
on one typically frantic afternoon , a producer scribbled down instructions for post-match reactions			0
one was for the @entity58 director at @entity101 , who had just beaten @entity103			2
‘ get me an interview with @entity105 and @entity106 ! ’ it read			0
the @entity108 ’s actual manager , @entity107 , was obviously more difficult to get hold of than the late , much - loved @entity111 comedian ! video first time @entity3 theme tune broadcast in 1970 on monday mornings i would often field a phone call or two from irate managers who felt their team had been treated unfairly			2
and to this day , fans do n’t like their team being featured last			0
the show itself only came about because , in the early 1960s , @entity58 ’s ambitions to carry live league and cup football were repeatedly thwarted by football authorities			1
@entity126 chief @entity125 was concerned the game would be damaged by over-exposure on tv			0
ironically , now one pump primes the other			0
a deal was finally struck and a fee of £ 20,000 was agreed for 36 ‘ highlights ’ matches , and the new series ’ home was to be the fledgling @entity138 , then only broadcasting in @entity139			0
when the first programme went on air at 6.30pm on saturday , august 22 , the 47,620 crowd at @entity143 that had watched champions @entity103 beat @entity146 3 - 2 in ‘ @entity147 ’ , as commentator , @entity148 regaled us , was more than watched the tv show			2
favourite : @entity3 has played a special part in millions of people 's lives for the past 50 years a black cat ran across the pitch that day			1
a lucky omen for the new programme ? reviews were mixed			0
one tv critic claimed : ‘ it looks like a proper clanger to me			0
the real sporting breakthrough on tv will come when pay tv arrives			0
’ well , half right , because despite the proliferation of live football , @entity3 still thrives , this season with some new faces but an established format			1
as one ’s own life - cycle spins , i have found myself with two young sons hiding behind the settee waiting for it to start			0
and , as the years have flown past , we all now share a beer before settling down to watch @entity180 introduce the action			2
on saturday night , we ’ll raise a glass to @entity3 — a show with a clock that just keeps ticking @entity187 intro 2013/14 season			1
