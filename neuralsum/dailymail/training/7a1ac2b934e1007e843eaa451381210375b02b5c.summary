celebrities , civil rights campaigners and politicians today called for @entity3 to secure the release of a father from @entity6 who has spent 13 years languishing in @entity7 without trial			1
their plea , in a letter to the @entity11 , urges the prime minister to ‘ pick up the phone to president @entity3 , and bring @entity14 home ’			2
the letter comes days after the @entity11 exposed how the @entity18 resident – who has a @entity18 wife and four children – has been held without being tried for more than a decade in the notorious @entity22 jail			0
organised by the @entity37 campaign , the letter has been signed by mps from across the political spectrum , including former @entity41 shadow home secretary @entity40 , @entity43 mp and former home office minister @entity44 , and @entity46 mp @entity45			0
celebrity backers include @entity48 of @entity49 , tv presenter @entity50 and her singer daughter @entity51 , and the actress @entity52			1
it is also signed by journalist and author @entity56 , poet @entity57 , and novelist @entity58 as well as prominent human rights campaigners including the @entity61 director @entity60			0
appalled : supporters of his release include the actress @entity52 ( left ) and @entity49 's @entity48 they say mr @entity14 ’s continued detention without charge or trial is ‘ in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned that was enshrined in @entity72 ’			1
calling on the @entity74 to address the case ‘ urgently ’ , they say the @entity77 ’s ongoing imprisonment is ‘ all the more shocking ’ because he has twice been approved for release by the @entity80 government			0
journalist @entity81 is involved in the campaign they refer to a letter mr @entity87 sent to mr @entity14 ’s daughter @entity88 last june , in which he said the decision regarding release was ‘ ultimately in the hands of the @entity92 ’			1
their letter also refers to ‘ rumours ’ that the @entity80 would like to send mr @entity14 back to @entity96 , where he was born , claiming this would leave him ‘ unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment ’			2
it adds : ‘ what the @entity80 would like to do with mr @entity14 is irrelevant , as the @entity18 government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of mr @entity14 , given his status as a legal @entity18 resident			2
‘ we can find no reason why , given the special relationship between our two countries , the pm can not call president @entity3 and tell him that mr @entity14 must be returned to the @entity18 as swiftly as @entity113 urge mr @entity87 to pick up the phone to president @entity3 , and to bring @entity14 home			1
’ mr @entity14 ’s case was given new prominence following the release of a @entity80 @entity120 report into how the @entity122 tortured terror suspects			1
according to his family , who live in @entity125 , @entity6 , the 46 - year - old is desperate to stand trial over claims that he is a terrorist with close links to @entity129			0
his lawyers say he is being held at the @entity80 base because intelligence officials fear he could expose more evidence of torture in the presence of @entity18 intelligence officers			0
signatories : @entity138 @entity51 ( left ) and comedian @entity139 ( right ) are among the big names last week , @entity141 insisted that the @entity18 continued to press the case at the ‘ highest levels ’ – diplomatic code for the @entity145 a spokesman for mr @entity87 said the government was pushing for mr @entity14 ’s release ‘ as a matter of urgency ’			1
she said : ‘ we will keep pressing it			0
it is our objective to get him back to the @entity18			0
that decision is in the hands of the @entity80 government			0
’ mr @entity14 has twice been cleared for release , originally in 2007 , but his detention has been extended again and again because officials insist he must go back to @entity96 , rather than home to @entity18			1
torture : a @entity80 senate report last week laid bare the full , horrifying extent of detainees ' treatment at the base he was detained in @entity169 , in 2001			2
his representatives claim he had travelled to @entity171 to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an @entity174 charity			0
they say he was captured by bounty hunters and eventually handed to @entity80 forces , who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘ black site ’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at @entity183 air force base , near @entity169			0
he was then sent to @entity7 in february 2002 , where he remains with about 130 prisoners			0
the prime minister must make @entity3 free this @entity187 : read the campaign letter in full as we approach 2015 , the 800th anniversary of the signing of @entity72 , which introduced habeas corpus to the world , we call on @entity87 to urgently address the case of @entity14 , a legal @entity18 resident with a @entity18 wife and four @entity18 children			1
he continues to be imprisoned without charge or trial in the @entity80 prison in @entity7 , @entity22 , in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned which was enshrined in @entity72			0
mr @entity14 ’s ongoing imprisonment is all the more shocking because he has been approved for release by the @entity80 on two occasions — by a military review board under president @entity206 in 2007 and by a high - level , inter-agency task force under president @entity3 in 2009			1
the @entity18 government has been requesting his return since 2007 , and we received assurances from mr @entity87 in june 2013 that he had raised mr @entity14 ’s case with president @entity3			1
torture at @entity7 including waterboarding and rectal feeding was dubbed ' brutal and ineffective ' in a letter to mr @entity14 ’s daughter , @entity88 , last june , the @entity74 wrote : ‘ despite efforts to secure his release , it remains the case that he has been cleared for transfer but not for release			1
’ he added : ‘ it also remains the case that any decision regarding your father ’s release remains ultimately in the hands of the @entity80 government			0
’ does mr @entity87 ’s comment to mr @entity14 ’s daughter about being cleared for transfer refer to rumours that the @entity80 government would like to send mr @entity14 , a @entity187 , back to @entity96 , the country of his birth ? this would , no doubt , be convenient for the @entity80 , as from there mr @entity14 would be unable to talk about the torture and abuse he has witnessed and personally experienced during his long imprisonment			2
however , what the @entity80 would like to do with mr @entity14 is irrelevant , as the @entity18 government has a non-negotiable responsibility to secure the return of mr @entity14 , given his status as a legal @entity18 resident			2
we can find no reason why , given the special relationship between our two countries , the prime minister can not call president @entity3 and tell him that mr @entity14 must be returned to the @entity18 as swiftly as possible			1
we urge mr @entity87 to pick up the phone to president @entity3 , and to bring @entity14 home			1
