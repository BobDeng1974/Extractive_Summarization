it ’s very rare to look at a professional photograph these days and not assume it ’s been digitally altered			2
but one artist is bucking the digital trend – refusing to use @entity5 and taking his photographs with analogue cameras			1
@entity10 photographer @entity9 ’s photographs are born out of his imagination and bringing them to life takes more hard work than the average photo shoot			1
roll it up : one model rolls up what appears to be pre-grown grass and slings it under her arm , while another lays down a piece of fabric , while holding a vintage sewing machine flower children : a model is photographed with a bouquet of flowers on her head , while butterflies fly out of the other model 's book @entity9 commenced his career at 16 - years - old , where he would play around in his spare time while working at a photo lab. speaking with photography blog @entity41 , he admitted that the challenge of shooting on film is what excites him			1
‘ i see film photography as a game in a casino			2
you can win big or lose it all			0
i press the shutter release button and then i have to wait to find out the results when the film is processed , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a very cool feeling , addictive like a drug			0
’ @entity55 into the soul : one model is perched atop a crumbling shack , with the other standing next to a tree covered in intricate bird feeders the sea , the sea : both models are photographed near the ocean , birds circle above one and the other holds just one red balloon fielding out a landscape : both models stand in a field - one appears to be painting the grass green , while the other appears to be burning the crop to the ground captured using @entity76 and @entity77 88 medium format cameras , @entity9 uses a variety of lenses to get the effect he desires			1
with twelve shots captured to each roll of film , he ’s also unable to review the captured photographs until the film is developed			0
while the photographs are not created using @entity5 , he does admit to using them to digitally modify the images			1
not to create the sets or resize the props , merely to correct the colouring in the final images and remove specks of dust from the frame			1
deciding what he will shoot is n’t even the struggle , as it is for so many artists			0
preparing the shoot does n’t involve a keyboard and mouse , but a notepad and pen			0
painting the town red : red features prominently in both photographs - where one has flaming red hair hanging to the side of her cape , the other appears to be painting the leaves red shine a light on me : one model is walking out of a tunnel with a fire ball in her hand , while a male model struggles to kiss what appears to be his lover - her body shrouded in sheer material taking a trip : the model on the left rides through the sky , while the one on the right sits perched on top of a stack of oversized vintage luggage the props themselves would often take days to create – with the photos featured containing fake butterflies of varying sizes , oversized matchsticks , a stack of fake books , up to 21 light wooden bird feeders and pile of oversized vintage - style luggage			2
on top of that , there ’s hair , costumes and makeup to take into consideration			0
@entity9 is based in @entity10			1
anybody interested in purchasing his art can visit his website or @entity160 page			0
@entity161 : fire , the sea and butterflies feature in several photographs by @entity9 @entity166 left hanging on the telephone : both in autumnal landscapes , the model on the left 's hair hangs out of a vintage telephone box , while the model on the right holds on to two chords in a forest			2
