" ' and then other people started thinking " @entity69 how you will live without your hairdresser "			2
' ms @entity1 applied for the program before telling her partner of 11 years , @entity73 , who just laughed when she finally came clean			1
' she must have seen it somewhere as well so her attitude or comment was " yes , i saw that and of course you would apply for that			0
