@entity0 has the best comeback lines			1
he 's a soft touch , they 've been saying in @entity6 ; the club needs to be ruled with an iron fist , they add ; the players need tough love , they complain			1
@entity0 dealt with the issue last week in a press conference , arching his trademark left eyebrow into its most quizzical state of scepticism			1
' this soft touch has won three @entity17 , ' he said			1
and it 's hard to argue with that			0
they will argue with it , of course , at @entity6			1
tuesday 's @entity17 tie against @entity24 should be some blessed relief from domestic worries but then this has often been @entity0 's way			1
he is after all the @entity17 specialist			2
the debacle of @entity31 aside - when his team threw away a 3 - 0 lead to lose the 2005 final @entity34 – it is a competition which has been very good to him			2
@entity0 characteristically raises his eyebrow during a press conference on monday @entity0 's laid - back attitude means he is loved by the majority he comes into contact with it was the trophy that saved him last summer			1
the muttering at the club was that he would be dismissed but , having delivered the much - anticipated ' decima ' - @entity6 's tenth @entity17 after a gap of twelve years - even the powers that be at the @entity47 did n't quite have the stomach to sack him			1
but the credit @entity0 accrued for that historic win is now being called in			2
at the turn of the year @entity6 were considered the most - formidable team in world football ; they had a four - point lead at the top of @entity56 and the so - called @entity57 – @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 – looked unstoppable			1
whatever happened to the players over the @entity64 break , it was n't good			0
since then the club has been knocked out of the @entity66 by @entity67 , which was quickly followed by the 4 - 0 defeat at the @entity69 to their @entity6 rivals			1
then there was the under - par home draw to @entity73 last weekend and saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity75			2
@entity6 - and @entity60 - have struggled for results in recent weeks there are doubts over the suitability of @entity80 @entity58 at the @entity81 @entity75 players run off to celebrate with @entity83 after scoring during the win over @entity6 @entity85 with last season 's @entity17 trophy - which saved @entity0 's job the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity67 was the one that really stung president @entity92 and it elicited a presidential visit to the dressing room and promise from the team leaders that things would improve			1
but those captains include @entity99 , currently out injured , @entity100 , described by one commentator as being reduced to the status of a ' celebrity ' in goal , and @entity60 , whistled at the @entity47 for enjoying an extravagant birthday party on the immediate aftermath of that 4 - 0 defeat			2
when the president demands more and the result is a 1 - 1 home draw and a defeat to @entity75 , then it 's the manager who gets the blame			2
@entity0 is well used to this of course			2
he is a specialist in working for the most - demanding owners football can fathom , his cv including stints with @entity121 at @entity122 , who was eventually convicted of £ 6million fraud , former @entity126 prime minister @entity125 at @entity127 , @entity128 at @entity129 and now @entity92 at @entity130			1
and he has played this part before			0
his final year at @entity129 was also undermined by whispers that he was too friendly with the players , that he was n't tough enough on them , that the training was too soft			0
the fact that @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 loved @entity0 – they took him to the pub on the last day of the season in 2011 when @entity0 had found out he had been sacked – probably did n't help , given that those three players were not in the good books of the board at the time			1
@entity6 president @entity92 has made his feelings known in the @entity150 capital there is a deeper parallel between @entity129 and @entity6			1
both had tired of the antics and histrionics of @entity156 and eventually settled on @entity0 as the polar opposite			2
where @entity156 attacks at full throttle , @entity0 can make his point with a mere raising of those expressive eyebrows ; where @entity156 sees conspiracies , @entity0 simply smiles enigmatically ; and while @entity156 appears to value a state of perpetual conflict , @entity0 prefers to be a peacemaker			2
but while he is seen as the antidote to @entity156 , when things go wrong , what were once seen as strengths are suddenly picked on as weakness : he is too conciliatory , too consensual , too caring			0
it is hard not to like @entity0			2
not many managers at his level would have the self - depreciation to describe themselves as ' a fat boy with a bowful of @entity179 tortellini			0
' when @entity181 fans compared him to a pig , he objected on the grounds that it was insulting to pigs			0
after all , he had grown up on a pig farm and food is the other great passion of his life			0
he once took @entity190 on a 100 - mile round trip to @entity122 to ensure he tried a favourite restaurant			0
@entity60 heads home as @entity6 comfortably swept aside @entity24 in the last - 16 first leg in @entity195 @entity156 and @entity0 's feud was defused by the @entity126 in a matter of seconds @entity0 once took @entity190 ( centre ) on a 100 - mile drive to show him his favourite restaurant his playful humour is often lost in translation			1
but he is the man who once took up an entire team meeting at @entity127 to organise a practical joke on @entity206 , the punch line of which was unprintable and adolescent in its obscenity and yet funny nonetheless			0
his geniality wo n't save him of course			0
though progressing through to the @entity17 quarter - finals should be a breeze , with a 2 - 0 lead secured in @entity217 , there is a meeting with @entity219 at the @entity220 on sunday week which now looks ominous			1
being pleasant is never enough			0
but being good can be and fortunately @entity0 is			0
significantly all the signs are that the players at @entity6 are behind him but then he is hard man to fall out with for long			1
when he and @entity156 were trading barbs , when @entity0 was at @entity127 and @entity129 and @entity156 was at @entity224 , the @entity126 eventually wearied of the whole charade			0
when @entity129 and @entity224 met in the @entity17 that year @entity0 deliberately sort out @entity156 in the tunnel beforehand to shake hands and agree a truce			1
' we made a pact , ' said @entity0			0
' no more bickering , no more controversy			0
six words , a handshake and in ten seconds we had an understanding			0
' it 's hard to fight against grace			0
in quietly going about his business , he demonstrates that there 's more than one way to be an effective football manager			0
the big bosses who run football clubs may be un-nerved by his manner but they can not deny his record			0
and if he does need the @entity17 to save him yet again this year , starting with @entity24 , at least he knows the competition is like an old friend to him , always there to help him through the critical moments in his career .			1

@entity0 's laid - back style offers relief from other managers
@entity6 should progress in the @entity17 quarter - finals
they face @entity24 at the @entity81 with a two - goal lead
@entity0 is well - liked by the players but @entity92 wants results
