a @entity1 rancher has now found three of her cows mutilated in bizarre and unusual ways and after ruling out every explanation under the sun , she 's prepared to look further into the heavens toward a culprit more outlandish : aliens			1
@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity1 says the first example occurred back in 2011			1
that cow had its tongue completely excised , along with one of its ears			2
she assumed teenagers were to blame			0
but after she found two more cows with mutilated genitals and missing organs on her farm just this summer , she now believes something harder to explain could be to blame and local police agree with her			1
she first noticed its tongue was missing , which was appalling enough			2
but she then realized the cow ’s udders , anus , reproductive organs , and ears had all been removed			0
about two weeks later , it happened again			0
though she had n’t called a veterinarian to inspect the first two cows , she did get one in to see the third			0
whodunnit ? all three cows were female and had their tongues completely removed ‘ i ’m normally a very private person , ’ @entity31 told @entity47			1
‘ but i ’m willing to do this because it ’s just something i want some answers to			0
’ the vet ’s findings only served to disturb @entity31 even more			0
though he was unable to determine a cause of death , the vet told @entity31 that the cuts were extremely precise , almost surgically so			0
grotesque : pictured is the third mutilated cow			1
its heart had been removed and left to hang outside its body mysterious : beneath one of the cows was a mysterious char mark in a perfect outline of the mutilated animal what ’s more , despite the grievous injuries to the cows , no blood was found			1
underneath the third cow , there was a mysteriously charred outline of the cow itself			1
it ’s heart had also been cut from its body but left to hang outside the cow			1
‘ we could n’t see any signs of trauma , and it does n’t appear that there was any type of wild animal , such coyotes , that were involved , ’ @entity80 , @entity81 ’s chief deputy , told @entity82			0
faced with having found three of her cows , all female , all with their tongues removed , and two with missing reproductive organs dead on her farm , @entity31 is now searching for answers			1
precision : the incisions used to cut the cows were surgically precise and did not bleed utterly disgusting : the two cows killed this july were found with mutilated genitals and missing udders ‘ the more it happens , the more questions you get			1
and the more you learn , you find more and more things that make you ask more questions , ’ @entity31 said			0
@entity31 said some of those questions might have her looking toward the sky			0
‘ something happened to these cows and it 's not something that you see every day , it 's not in your normal , so something else is going on , ’ she said			2
and the local sheriff ’s office is n’t ruling aliens out , either			1
‘ we ’re having to look at this from two sides , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ some people believe that there are aliens that are involved in this or the possibility of the occult going to the other end of the spectrum			2
’ = open - minded : @entity31 says all the normal explanations have been debunked and is ready to believe aliens could be to blame			2
' the more it happens , the more questions you get , ' she said			0

all three of @entity9 's mutilated cows were missing their tongues
despite the *gruesome* injuries , none of the cows bled form their wounds
one cow 's outline was burned into the grass beneath its *desecrated* body
police are *n't* ruling out aliens or occult explanations , either
