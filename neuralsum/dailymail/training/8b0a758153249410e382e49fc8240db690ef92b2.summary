' speaking about his former girlfriend - who he had only been seeing for one week when @entity57 was murdered - @entity14 said he understands why @entity8 did not return to @entity15 for the trial and said he has no regrets			1
' it 's her decision [ to come back ] , she is an adult and can make whatever decision she wants , ' he said			0
' as i said before , i never regret it , it is not her fault what is happening			0
it is a big huge mistake against two human beings			0
' we are innocent and we are fighting for our innocence			0

' @entity14 had been dating @entity2 in @entity15 for just one week when the couple came under investigation for the murder of @entity50 university student @entity57 back in 2007 @entity8 was spotted taking a walk in the rain in her hometown of @entity83 yesterday seemingly without a care in the world			1
she said repeatedly in the run - up to the retrial that she will not return to @entity15 where she is accused of murdering her @entity50 roommate in 2007			2
the 26 - year - old and @entity14 served four years in jail for the murder of @entity10 , who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with @entity8 in @entity95 , @entity15			1
both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in march this year @entity15 ’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial			1
in june , judges published the reasons for that decision , saying the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘ deficiencies contradictions and illogical conclusions ’			0

‘ i was imprisoned as an innocent person and i just ca n’t re-live that , ’ said told the today show last week			0
