by @entity0 standing in front of the bathroom mirror , my mouth open as wide as it will go , i 'm attempting to warble vowel sounds , like a singer warming up before a performance			1
it 's a good thing the door is locked - and not just because my tuneless caterwauling means i wo n't be appearing on @entity11 any time soon			1
rather it 's because inside my mouth is a bizarre @entity14 device that promises it will firm my face and reduce my wrinkles			1
miracle wrinkle exterminator ? @entity0 with the @entity19 normally , i 'd welcome any chance to roll back the years			1
i 'd love to erase the lines that have come with having two children and turning 40 , and re-define a jawline that 's starting to sag			2
and this device has been causing a buzz on the internet			2
according to its manufacturers , the @entity19 is all i require for a more youthful look			1
' to get and maintain the perfect visage , you do n't need the cosmetic surgeon 's knife			2
all you need is the mouthpiece , ' they claim in their blurb			2
it 's quite a promise			1
i am on tenterhooks as i wait for the parcel to arrive			2
but it 's not just the cost of the mouthpiece - £ 49 - that gives me a shock			2
this secret weapon in the battle against age is a malleable silicone rubber mould that fits in the mouth behind the teeth and which is attached to oversized sugar - pink lips			2
it looks as if it would be more at home in a horror movie than in a family bathroom			2
the makers blithely claim it 's perfect for using ' in front of the mirror , in the bath or at any other convenient time every day '			1
but while i 'm happy to apply make - up and style my hair in my car as i wait at traffic lights , this is one aspect of my beauty routine that wo n't be put on public view			2
never mind the ridicule , i 'd be afraid of being arrested			2
winning smile ? @entity0 enunciates the five vowel sounds as part of the @entity19 exercise regimen the idea is that you put the mouthpiece in and then pull a series of facial expressions - the shapes you make when you enunciate the five vowel sounds			1
by repeatedly doing this you supposedly exercise your facial muscles and so tone and de-stress the face , relaxing wrinkles and firming saggy skin			1
the mouthpiece - which is hinged at the back like a pair of comedy false teeth - apparently provides extra resistance , making the exercises more effective			1
the manufacturers claim three minutes of exercising a day is all you need to reap the benefits			0
it does n't sound like much , but in a house with a five - year - old girl and a three - year - old boy , privacy is hard to come by			0
given that i do n't want to give my children nightmares by showing them my new ' look ' , it 's surprisingly difficult to find a time when i wont be interrupted			0
eventually , i decide to do my exercises in the evening once the children have gone to bed			1
the online pictures of a woman demonstrating the anti-ageing exerciser show her making exaggerated mouth shapes , so that 's what i do			0
she also opens her eyes very wide - making her look as if she 's being attacked by a pair of giant lips - so again i follow her example			0
there 's no explanation as to why widening your eyes is beneficial , but perhaps it helps erase crows ' feet			0
alternatively , it might just be an understandably natural reaction of horror when faced with having to wear the horrible - looking device			0
spot the difference ? maybe not i find that to ensure i ’m making the right expressions - smiling when i mouth the letter ' e ' , opening my mouth very wide for ' i ' and pushing my chin forward for ' u ' - it ’s best if i sing the vowels loudly			0
while it 's not painful to wear , the device is uncomfortable because it distends my mouth			0
sometimes i find it makes me dribble unattractively			0
doing my facial exercises does not become the favourite part of my day			1
my husband , passing the bathroom one evening and hearing my warbling , asks if i 'm feeling all right			0
i mumble ' i 'm fine ' as best as i can : there 's no way i ’m opening the door and showing him what i look like			0
i soon get into the habit of doing my facial exercises before going to bed			1
after a week i wonder if it 's making a difference			0
i would n't exactly say that i am seeing the ' more youthful , vibrant ' face as promised by the makers , but there is definitely a tightening sensation around my jawline			1
more worryingly , i think i am developing an intolerance to the mouthpiece			0
the more i wear it , the more uncomfortable it becomes , catching the back of my throat and making me gag			0
still , as we all know when it comes to beauty , there 's no gain without pain , so i battle on for a second week			0
but i am having to take short breaks between making the various vowel sounds , rather than doing them all in one go			0
@entity176 is a teacher of face yoga , which is a technique that combines acupressure , massage and facial exercises to give a more youthful look			1
she 's sceptical about the effectiveness of the @entity19			1
' there are 57 muscles in the face			0
the technique i teach isolates them , so it 's done in a controlled way , but i do n't think that repeating vowel sounds would be targeted enough , ' says @entity176			0
dubious : the odd @entity14 device ' and while i can understand the theory that resistance would help , i do n't think this is going to make your face look slimmer or erase wrinkles			1
' so , after two weeks of doing facial exercises with fake lips , what ’s my final verdict ? am i looking any younger ? friends say my face possibly looks a little plumper and more toned , though it has to be said the results are on the subtle side			1
perhaps if i can get over my aversion to the mouthpiece , i can keep it in for longer at a time and get more dramatic results			1
it 's either that or i ’m back to pinning my hopes for eternal youth on anti-ageing creams and positive thinking .			0

makers of @entity19 promise youthful results
idea is to do facial exercises while wearing it
this should tone the skin reducing wrinkles
but does it actually work ?
