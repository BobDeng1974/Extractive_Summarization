' i prescribe the @entity30 - step one , polish ; step two , cleanse ; step three , nourish - to all of my patients , regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics ' , he said			2
dr @entity11 says method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis ( the lower layer of the skin ) to the epidermis ( the outermost layer )			1
' @entity44 - focused skin care regimes are not effective because the ingredients , no matter how therapeutic , are not able to reach the dermis			0
instead , the skin must be stimulated to repair itself , ' he said			0
working his magic : new mother @entity2 tweeted to say she feels younger every time she visits dr @entity11 in @entity12 skin guru : as he launches his new book , @entity25 , dr @entity11 shared the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his a-list clients , including @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 the @entity57 reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing , or exfoliation , followed by cleansing , and then nourishing			1
he believes that by polishing first , the result is a deeper cleanse , a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal			0
' say , for example , you wanted to replace a tile floor			0
if your epidermis is the floor , then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old , worn out tiles			0
next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris , e.g. cleansing , and finally fresh tiles have to be laid , which represent the nourish step , ' he said			0
' exfoliation creates a " controlled injury " , ' he explains			0
' @entity84 exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed , expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis			0
' the controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process , giving skin a younger , fresher look			0
