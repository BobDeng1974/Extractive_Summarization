by @entity0 , political editor published : 18:39 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 24 april 2013 concerns : schools minister @entity2 claims half of all stay - at - home mothers want to work half of all stay - at - home mothers want to go out to work and the government is right to target tax breaks at working women , the education minister said last night			1
@entity2 said two - earner families were ‘ now the norm ’ and said she was concerned mothers were ‘ made to feel guilty ’ when they had no choice but to go out to work for financial reasons			1
miss @entity2 , a 37 - year - old mother - of - two , said @entity16 was ‘ the original working mum ’ and would support the government ’s efforts to enable more women to go into work by helping with the cost of childcare			1
‘ i think it is a problem where 50 per cent of stay - at - home mums say that they want to go out to work and ca n’t afford the childcare , ’ she told the @entity25 ’s @entity24 programme			1
‘ two - thirds of mums in @entity32 go out to work - for economic reasons , and this is a trend across the world			2
dual income families are now the norm			0
‘ i ’m very concerned those mums are made to feel guilty about a choice they do n’t really have			1
in a country like @entity42 , with very high quality early education , parents do feel less guilty , it ’s more of a normal thing			2
’ some @entity48 mps and a new pressure group , mothers at @entity51 , have criticised the government ’s policies on tax and childcare and risk the ‘ cohesion of society ’ by undermining the one earner family			0
last month ’s @entity59 confirmed the government ’s plans to reduce child benefit from families with a single earner on £ 50,000 , and axe it altogether for those with one on £ 60,000			0
two earner couples who each earn just under those thresholds will be able to keep on claiming			0
while the government has set out plans to offer tax breaks worth £ 1,200 per child for working couples , to come into effect from 2015 , a long - promised tax break for marriage , which would benefit both single and dual earner families , has yet to materialise			2
juggling act : @entity80 said many mothers were ' made to feel guilty ' when they had no choice but to go out to work for financial reasons miss @entity2 insisted the government was not discriminating against stay - at - home mothers by reducing child benefit for the top 15 per cent of earners			1
‘ what we ’re saying is , why should someone who works at @entity89 on a shift , why should they pay to support people who are very well off ? that ’s not right			0
what we ’re doing is we are targeting resources on where it is needed most , ’ she said			0
the minister said @entity16 was ‘ the original working mum and she introduced independent taxation for women which was a massive reform in its day ’			1
‘ rather than saying married women should be taxed according to their husband ’s income , [ she ] actually said women ’s income is valuable in itself			0
and that was a major change			0
@entity16 pictured with her children @entity111 and @entity113 in 1959			2
miss @entity2 described the late former prime minister as ' the original working mum ' ‘ it is obviously true that having a higher maternal employment rate does help a country ’s gdp			1
that ’s a decision @entity121 made when they had one of the lowest maternal employment rates			0
they were educating a lot of women and finding that they were dropping out of the labour force simply because the school day was half as long as in @entity32 such that they were not able to go out to work			2
@entity121 has now changed its system			0
’ miss @entity2 repeated her criticism of pre-school education in @entity32 , insisting more nurseries should adopt the more formal @entity42 model where children have structured sessions led by a graduate - level teacher .			1

@entity2 said half of all stay - at - home mothers want to go out to work
mother - of - two @entity2 said @entity16 was the ' original working mum '
mothers ' made to feel guilty ' when they had no choice but to go out to work
