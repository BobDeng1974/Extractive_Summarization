by @entity0 for @entity1 if investigating @entity3 ’s vast network of sewers does n’t sound like your idea of a romantic date , how about doing it search of great globules of fat blocking the drains ? as unappealing as that sounds to most of us , one couple celebrated their love under the streets of the capital while on the lookout for ‘ fatbergs ’			1
@entity22 decided to surprise girlfriend @entity23 with the excursion to mark their one year anniversary			1
@entity22 and girlfriend @entity23 share a tender moment during their one - year anniversary celebrations in @entity3 's sewer system the couple discovered their shared interest in greasy globules when a record 15 - tonne fatberg was discovered under @entity35 last year the pair first discovered their mutual passion for fatbergs when the notorious 15 - tonne , double decker bus - sized fatberg – the biggest ever found in the @entity42 – was found causing chaos in @entity35 a year ago			1
so mr @entity22 secretly wrote to @entity44 with the request to tour the sewers to celebrate their one - year anniversary			1
mr @entity22 , said : ‘ it was incredible to see real - life fatbergs			1
we 're very grateful to @entity44 for arranging this trip			2
it has been a dream come true - the perfect anniversary present ! ’ shocked @entity23 , said : ‘ it was an amazing experience , the sewer architecture was incredible			1
it was a fantastic surprise			0
’ @entity56 is the term used by @entity44 to refer to a congealed lump of fat , which can often contain other items which do n't break down , such as nappies , sanitary items and wet wipes the pair spent a couple of hours with the @entity44 sewer team as they carried out maintenance work in @entity68 , then went underground for forty minutes before resurfacing among the well - dressed crowds of @entity68 revellers			1
' @entity56 ' is the term used by @entity44 to refer to a congealed lump of fat , along with other items which do n't break down such as nappies , sanitary items and wet wipes			1
these masses collect and block the sewer pipes , causing clogs ortotal blockages			2
last year a record 15 - tonne fatberg was discovered under @entity35			2
the mass caused sewage flow through pipes to be reduced to 5 per cent of normal capacity			0
the blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets			0
engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it			0
in the @entity94 , @entity44 spent £ 2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £ 12million in 2012			1
it 's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to current fatbergs , a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our @entity103 sewers can not deal with			0
@entity105 of @entity44 , who organised the bizarre date , said : ‘ it was a pleasure to have @entity22 and @entity23 along with us last night to help us ‘ fight the fatberg ’			1
‘ while fatbergs are an unusual sight that few people get to see , the real and very unromantic side of it is they cause serious blockages that lead to sewer flooding			2
so help my sewer team have a happy ending too - and remember the only thing that should go down the loo is toilet paper and human waste			0
’ however , the man in charge of @entity3 ’s sewer network , @entity126 , was quick to dash the hopes of other couples hoping for a tryst in the bowels of @entity3			2
he says he does n't intend to open his manholes for anyone else			0
he added : ‘ these two are fatberg crazy , and once we were over the shock of the request we did n’t want to stand in the way of true love			0
but , we are definitely not tour guides			0
our sewers are dangerous and we have a serious job to do to keep them flowing			0
sorry , before anybody gets any ideas , this was strictly a one - off			0

@entity22 and @entity23 met in 2013 when a fatberg was causing havoc in @entity3
became *fascinated* by the sewer blockages made of congealed lumps of fat
@entity22 secretly arranged trip to @entity3 sewers to mark one - year anniversary
couple had to wear *safety* gear and *overalls* for the 40 - minute visit
@entity44 say this unusual date was a ' one - off '
