it 's not clear how much longer the director will be detained			0
the video titled ' happy in @entity38 ' features the group dancing in various locales just as in the original and is one of hundreds of covers of the hit made by fans around the world			2
but after the video hit @entity61 and racked up close to 200,000 views with the help of @entity65 news sites like the @entity66 , authorities hunted down its stars , interrogated them in footage seen across the country and threw them in jail			1

' following a series of intelligence and police operations and after coordinating with the judiciary , all the suspects were identified and arrested , ' said @entity82			0
the @entity3 ' rendition of the hit angered authorities who seemed to fear it was evidence of a new generation casting aside the old @entity102 lifestyle for @entity65 ideals ( a still from the remake is at left , with @entity6 at right ) islamic law requires women to cover their heads in public			1
authorities called the video ' vulgar ' their interrogations showed the women veiled and angry officers asking questions			2
