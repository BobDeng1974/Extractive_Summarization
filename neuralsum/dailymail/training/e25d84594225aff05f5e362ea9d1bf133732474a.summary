by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 8 november 2013 attorneys for the family of a @entity7 teenager who was found dead in a rolled - up wrestling mat have claimed video footage of his final moments was doctored			1
attorneys @entity9 and @entity10 argued that video released by authorities showing @entity14 's last moments at @entity15 appears to skip and that key footage showing the wrestling mats where his body was found was dark and blurry			1
their accusations come as a report written by the initial coroner in the case has also emerged , blasting authorities for their handling of the scene			1
coroner @entity27 wrote that the body had been moved by the time he arrived and that evidence bags were later opened			0
final moments : in footage released by authorities in @entity33 , @entity14 is seen running into the gymnasium just moments before he died			1
he was found in a rolled - up wrestling mat bizarre : but in the next frame , @entity14 is nowhere to be seen and other high school students are playing basketball , leading his family 's attorneys to accuse authorities of doctoring the footage the death of @entity14 on january 11 this year in @entity33 was initially ruled accidental , but his parents have been calling for justice ever since , claiming he was killed			1
after they disputed the coroner 's conclusion , they requested an independent autopsy that found @entity14 died of blunt force trauma			1
following the revelation , a judge ordered for the footage from the high school to be released but now the family 's attorneys have accused authorities of doctoring the footage			1
' we believe that the tape is proof that there is some conspiracy to conceal the truth from this family and the public as to who killed @entity14 , ' @entity9 said			2
' we believe that somebody corrupted this video			0
' the surveillance video shows @entity14 walking along a school hallway at 12.59pm on january 10 wearing a white t - shirt , jeans and white sneakers			2
he is also carrying a yellow folder or book			0
the next clip is 10 minutes later at 1.09pm when @entity78 in the gym where he was later found dead			2
missed : the death of @entity14 , 17 , was ruled accidental but his parents believe he was killed tragic : he is pictured heading to the gym , left , where he was found dead , right , after he failed to return home another student is seen walking in ahead of him			1
it is less than two seconds long and shows @entity14 walk out of the shot before what appears to be a dissolve edit between that clip and another showing students playing basketball			0
it 's unclear how much time has passed between the two clips			0
the attorney claims that time stamps were on freeze frames of the footage but not on the footage itself			0
attorney @entity10 added that @entity101 ’s officials had violated the judge 's ruling to provide key evidence collected in the case and accused them of tampering with the video , the @entity99 reported			0
' we feel that when you look at what photographs have been given , you must come to the conclusion that there were time codes that were part of the video that were either deleted or in some way made impossible to get any information from , ' @entity10 said			0
they added that one camera , which is pointed directly at where the wrestling mats are kept in the gym , only shows footage that is blurry and dark			0
questions : his family 's attorneys , @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) , pictured on @entity128 last month , said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark distraught : @entity132 and @entity133 have been calling for justice since their son died in january ' is it a coincidence that the one camera out of 36 cameras which we were given tape from … this is the only camera out of focus and does not give you a clear image ? ' @entity10 asked			1
@entity128 has also obtained a report in which the coroner slammed how the initial investigation was handled			0
he calls the investigative scene ' very poor '			0
' the body had been noticably [ sic ] moved , ' @entity33 coroner @entity27 wrote in a report dated january 22			2
' the scene had been compromised and there was no cooperation from law enforcement at the scene			0
furthermore the integrity of the evidence bag was compromised on january 13 , 2013 by opening the sealed bag and exhibiting the dead body to his father			0
' he continued : ' i do not approve of the manner this case was handled			0
' the 17 - year - old 's body was found stuck in an upright mat that had been rolled up and propped upright behind bleachers in the school gym after his parents reported him missing the night before			1
twist : when his body was exhumed for further investigations , it was found to be missing its organs and stuffed with newspaper instead			2
an independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma the sheriff has said he suspects @entity14 became trapped trying to retrieve a shoe that fell into the center of the large , rolled mat. a @entity191 medical examiner concluded that he died from positional asphyxia , meaning his body got stuck in a position in which he could n't breathe			1
despite @entity33 sheriff 's investigators concluding the death was a freak accident , his parents , @entity132 and @entity133 , insist that someone must have killed him			2
and in a further twist in the case , a private pathologist opened his body earlier this year to find his organs missing and replaced with newspaper			1
dr. @entity203 issued a report in august saying he detected hemorrhaging on the right side of @entity14 's neck			2
he concluded the teenager died from blunt force trauma near his carotid artery and that the fatal blow appeared to be non-accidental .			1

@entity14 , 17 , was found dead in a rolled - up mat in january and it was initially ruled an accident - but his parents believe he was killed
authorities have released footage of his final moments at the school
but the family 's attorneys say that the footage skips out parts and that other key moments are dark and blurry
it is just the latest twist in the case : an independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma and when his body was exhumed for tests , his organs were missing and his body was *filled* with newspaper
in further revelations , a report has emerged showing how the initial coroner *complained* about how investigators dealt with the scene
