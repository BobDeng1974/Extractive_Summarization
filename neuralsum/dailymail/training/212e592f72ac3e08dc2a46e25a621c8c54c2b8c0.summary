the bill designed to define when ' yes means yes ' to prevent sexual assaults was signed by @entity0 governor @entity6 ( pictured ) yesterday states and universities across the @entity2 are under pressure to change how they deal with sexual assault reports			1
campus sexual assault victims and women 's advocacy groups delivered petitions to @entity29 's office a fortnight ago urging him to sign the bill			2
senator @entity31 , who represents @entity32 , said the legislation will change how college campuses in @entity0 look in to sexual assaults			1
rather than using the refrain ' no means no , ' the definition of consent under the bill requires ' an affirmative , conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity			1
' he said : ' with one in five women on college campuses experiencing sexual assault , it is high time the conversation regarding sexual assault be shifted to one of prevention , justice , and healing			0
' lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal , and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person			1
advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault to have valid complaints			0
the bill requires training for faculty reviewing complaints so victims are not asked inappropriate questions when filing complaints			0
the bill also requires access to counselling , health care services and other resources			0

there was no opposition from @entity99 in the @entity107			0
@entity108 , an adviser to the @entity109 , wrote an editorial asking @entity29 not to sign the bill			0
