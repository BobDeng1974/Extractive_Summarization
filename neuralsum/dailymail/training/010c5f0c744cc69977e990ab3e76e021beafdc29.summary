' mr @entity0 has avoided campaigning for a no vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the border in the wake of the @entity16			1
in his autobiography , the former @entity18 leader claimed he was to blame for the party 's humiliating defeat by the @entity22 in 2007 , and the @entity23 have repeatedly described him as ' toxic '			1
but supporters insist he made one of the greatest all - time speeches in favour of the @entity28 in 2006 , when he warned @entity2 against turning in on itself with the nationalist ' politics of grievance '			1
speaking at a security conference in the @entity35 capital of @entity36 at the weekend , he said : ' to rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible , politically , economically or even emotionally			1
' born in @entity9 , mr @entity0 went to school in @entity41 before returning to @entity2 to attend @entity9 's @entity42			1
his father was born in @entity44 but grew up in @entity45			2
in his final speech to a @entity2 @entity18 conference in @entity48 in 2006 , he famously said : ' i detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope			2
' ex-chancellor @entity53 , leader of @entity54 , has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a ' call to arms ' to keep the @entity12 together			2
but mr @entity0 has been reluctant to speak out , in stark contrast with his successor , @entity59 , who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the @entity28			1
meanwhile , the journalist who first claimed mr @entity0 's government had ' sexed up ' a dossier on @entity64 has described the @entity22 's proposals for independence as ' every bit as dodgy '			1
in may 2003 , then - @entity69 journalist @entity68 said a claim that @entity64 could fire weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes had been included in a dossier even though the @entity74 knew it was probably ' wrong '			2
he said that originally the dossier had contained little that was new , but in the week before publication @entity75 had ordered it to be ' sexed up ' and new facts ' discovered ' to make it more exciting			0
' like the whole of @entity12 in 2003 , @entity2 in 2014 is being asked to fix a problem that does not exist			0
back then , it was an imaginary threat from @entity93			0
now , it is an imaginary threat to the @entity99 , 45 minutes from destruction if you vote no. ' back then , it was the supposed ' clash of civilisations ' between @entity104 and the @entity105			0
now , it is a supposed ' fundamental conflict of social values ' between two nations , @entity5 and @entity2 – whose social values , all surveys show , are extremely similar			0
' and just as in 2003 , @entity2 is also being asked to tackle another problem that is real and does exist – but in a way that will only make that problem worse , for itself , and for all of us			0
back then , we were told that invading @entity93 would protect us from international terrorism			0
