the @entity11 department store 's pet section opened in 1917 , and rivalled @entity11 zoo with a vast array of animals which it sold for more than 50 years until most were outlawed by the 1976 @entity16			1
barmy : @entity18 paid £ 3,000 in today 's money for @entity20 the lion cub , which he kept in his @entity22 flat the playwright @entity23 was one of its more famous customers , having an alligator bought for him for @entity27 in 1951 by the @entity29 actress @entity28			1

mr @entity18 told the @entity65 : ' it was a completely different time and the world has moved on			0
' after the @entity16 they could n’t have a zoo , and the pet shop was no longer a big draw so i understand they have to think of something more profitable but it ’s certainly the passing of an era			0
