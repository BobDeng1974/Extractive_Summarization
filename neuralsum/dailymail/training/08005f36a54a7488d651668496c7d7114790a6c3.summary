by @entity0 palace : the treehouse in @entity2 took a group of 25 people three years to build an award - winning treehouse which teenagers spent three years building 85ft up a lime tree will be torn down over health and safety fears			1
the group of boys built the lofty eight - storey - high home with a front door , windows , a spiral staircase and a viewing platform in a farmer 's field near the village of @entity21 , @entity2			1
but the farmer said it must be torn down because he could be sued if someone fell off - and it is so entwined in branches , the whole tree will have to be felled			1
the five main builders of the treehouse , which was worked on by 25 youngsters , said they were ' gutted ' at the demolition but understood why it had to happen			2
@entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 estimate 1,000 hours of work went into the hideout , which began modestly three years ago			1
work escalated last summer as they scavenged for materials from skips and built upon the 45ft home they had already constructed with no more tools than nails and a hammer			1
mr @entity32 , 19 , who hopes to study architecture at university , said : ' at the end of the day i will accept it but i will be pretty gutted about it as i put so much time into it			1
this summer could have been pretty awesome			1
' ' in about october we started building the top half and it coincided with the leaves falling off - that 's when villagers started to notice it			1
' i would say you have to be pretty reckless to ever fall or hurt yourself			0
we are always very careful with new people			0
mr @entity32 , who works at a shopping centre and with a carpenter , added : ' the worst injury i ever had there was i stood on a nail , that was when i was building it			1
i would not say it 's dangerous at all			0
' the astonishing palace in the sky was entered into a competition on @entity77 to find the nation 's best treehouse , and scooped the top prize			2
the judges of the @entity83 's @entity82 praised it for being ' ludicrously high up ' and reminded them of ' those halcyon days we all spent playing in a treehouse when we were younger '			2
who 'd live in a house like this ? from left , @entity36 , @entity35 and @entity32 , who built the tree a room with a view : the group built the 85ft home with nothing more than wood , nails and a hammer home comforts : they have even managed to haul a wicker sofa up into the tree - but the owner of the farm on which they built , @entity108 , fears he will be sued if someone falls to their death from the treetop home they also said it felt homely and had ' a strong feeling of the personality of everyone that created and continues to enjoy this treehouse			1
' farmer @entity108 said : ' i did n't know until it had been built			1
' they would have been alright if they had stayed [ at 40ft ] but it 's 80ft up			0
they went up above the canopy			0
' once i knew that , and people got on to me , i mentioned it to my insurance people and i dare not let it stay there			0
it 's just too ridiculous			0
you can see it from everywhere			0
' it 's very unfortunate			0
if i could see a way to leave it there i would have done			0
' but if someone falls and breaks something it will be my problem			2
' @entity142 neighbourhood : the young men said villagers started to notice the home late in its construction @entity147 : @entity32 , left with friends @entity36 and @entity35 , wants to be an architect the leafy home may be impressive , but it is far from the only ultra-ambitious treehouse in the world			2
the dense forests of @entity155 have several treetop homes which would not look out of place in fantasy novels			0
many were built as pet projects by carpenters or run as boutique hotels			2
at @entity164 in rural northern @entity165 , guests pay hundreds of pounds a night to stay in treehouses shaped like birds nests or made out of mirrors			0
those who want to take their lives in their hands by enjoying the @entity2 treehouse do not have long , however - as it is thought it will be felled in just a few weeks .			1

a 25 - strong group spent three years building palace in rural @entity2
it features spiral staircase , windows , front door and a viewing platform
but farmer @entity108 fears he will be held *responsible* if someone falls off
it is so well - built the entire lime tree will have to be felled within weeks
