by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 5 december 2012 postmen are threatening to deliver only half the mail , a militant union warned last night			0
thousands of vital letters such as energy bills and bank statements would fail to reach customers if the boycott went ahead – causing chaos for households and businesses			0
@entity12 has lost business to the likes of @entity15 and @entity16 over the past seven years			1
currently , half of all letters are handled by a rival company , with @entity12 responsible for only the final mile of the delivery			1
strike : @entity12 workers may ignore post sent via their ' unfair ' competitors who have caused job losses , price rises and fewer services the @entity29 said yesterday it will ballot its 200,000 members in the @entity31 about whether to boycott letters which have been handled by a rival firm			1
the ban would affect post from some of the country ’s biggest businesses			0
@entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are among those who use @entity12 ’s rivals to handle all or some of their letters			2
government departments such as @entity51 use @entity15			0
@entity29 members – the majority of whom work for @entity12 – will be asked a single question about whether they are prepared to boycott the delivery of mail handled by a rival			1
since 2005 , @entity12 has rapidly lost its key business customers , according to data published last month by postal regulator @entity62			2
just 5.2 per cent of all letters were handled by a rival in 2005			0
last year , the figure hit 44 per cent and @entity12 says it is now dangerously close to 50 per cent			1
this year , @entity15 expects to handle 3.8billion letters and @entity16 expects to handle 3billion			0
they pick up letters from their business customers , sort them , distribute them around the @entity69 and then pay @entity12 to put them through the letterbox , known as the ‘ final mile ’			1
boycott : @entity15 sent via competitors is still taken the ' final mile ' by postmen but this responsibility will be ignored if the strike goes ahead @entity78 , @entity29 deputy general secretary , said : ‘ what we are seeing is private companies being able to do what they want , with little concern for how it affects postal services in the round			2
’ concerns : @entity12 says all post must be delivered but admitted they are also worried by the rise cherry - picking competitors the union fears the impact on postal services could be ‘ catastrophic ’ if the problem is not dealt with , and leaves the crucial ‘ universal service obligation ( @entity96 ) ’ under threat			1
the @entity96 is the promise that @entity12 will pick up and deliver letters six days a week for a uniform price anywhere in @entity69			1
@entity15 poses an even bigger threat to @entity12 because it began a trial of its own postal service in @entity105 in april , in which it no longer uses @entity12 postmen			1
about 300,000 families and businesses in areas such as @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 get some of their mail delivered by @entity15 ’s 600 postmen dressed in their distinctive orange uniform			0
unlike @entity12 postmen , they have no obligation to meet targets set down by the regulator , such as the rule which says @entity12 must aim to deliver 93 per cent of first - class mail the next day			1
@entity15 wants to do more trials in cities across the @entity69 , which poses a major problem for @entity12 , because it will be left with the loss - making routes which no private business wants			2
@entity12 has already sharply hiked its stamp prices in a bid to make more money			2
a first - class stamp jumped from 46p to 60p in april , and could rise again at any time			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we are concerned about the impact of unfettered direct delivery competition			2
‘ currently , competitors are allowed to “ cherry - pick ” higher density , more profitable routes in urban areas and ignore lower density rural areas where delivery is more costly			0
’ @entity16 chief executive @entity143 said @entity15 had ‘ really upset the apple cart ’ with its @entity105 delivery trial			0
a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we disagree with the comments made in relation to @entity15 in this matter			0

strike could *happen* in @entity31 and all @entity153 post would just be ignored
unions say *commercial* competitors are costing jobs and do *n't* have to meet same *standards* of service or pay
@entity12 has been *criticised* for putting up price of stamps
its delivery *arm* made a profit for the first time in four years this year
