by @entity0 , education correspondent published : 14:44 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 03:00 est , 22 november 2012 teachers inflated children ’s marks in a new reading test and allowed half the questions to leak on to @entity7 and parenting websites , an official report revealed yesterday			1
nineteen of the 40 words used in the test were divulged on web forums popular with parents and teachers and even a national radio broadcast mid-way through the week - long testing period , according to exams watchdog @entity17			1
the ‘ phonics reading check ’ – taken for the first time this june by nearly 600,000 six - year - olds – was further compromised by ‘ skewed ’ and unreliable marking aimed at pushing as many pupils as possible over the pass mark of 32 out of 40			1
compromised : key words used in a new back - to - basics reading test for six - year - olds were leaked onto @entity7 and parenting websites nearly five times as many pupils achieved 32 marks as gained 31 , the report said , and the marks in the test were therefore ‘ significantly skewed ’			1
teachers were issued with the pass mark before they administered the test and @entity17 found this knowledge ‘ strongly influenced ’ marking			1
the @entity37 urged teachers to ‘ take professional responsibility for the accurate marking of the test so that the right children can be helped ’			2
the test involves checking how well pupils use the traditional ‘ phonics ’ method of reading , where children learn the letter sounds of @entity47 and how to blend them			2
as well as reading 20 real words , youngsters are expected to say 20 made - up words , such as ‘ pib ’ , ‘ queep ’ and ‘ groiks ’			2
the test was introduced by the @entity54 in an attempt to identify pupils at risk of falling behind in reading at an early stage so they could be given extra support			0
the test involves checking how well pupils use the traditional ' phonics ' method of reading , where children learn the letter sounds of @entity47 and how to blend them ( file picture ) this year 40 per cent – nearly 237,000 children – fell below the pass mark			0
the report published by @entity17 criticised the way the test had been run			0
schools are supposed to keep the questions secret since only one version of the test is used on each day of the testing week			0
but the report identified ‘ a number of breaches of the check ’s security in the course of the week ’			0
‘ these included check items being quoted in a national radio broadcast and referred to in forums and websites frequented by teachers and parents , ’ it said			1
a few also appeared on @entity7 posts			0
‘ in all , 19 of the 40 items had appeared in a variety of open locations by the end of the scheduled check week on 22nd june			1
’ @entity17 said the national testing agency had ensured the leaked words were taken down from websites as quickly as possible			2
it also said it did not believe the breaches were ‘ malicious ’ and said that there was ‘ negligible ’ likelihood of the leaks affecting children ’s chances in the test			0
the disclosure follows claims from @entity17 that ‘ over- marking ’ by teachers of coursework assignments was a major cause of the gcse @entity47 grading fiasco .			0
