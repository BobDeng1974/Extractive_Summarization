with its secluded yet central location , elegant grounds and distinguished history , it is , you might think , the perfect @entity7 home			1
add to that a @entity9 - themed nursery and a £ 4.5 million recent refurbishment ( courtesy of the taxpayer ) and @entity13 would appear to be the ideal place for the @entity15 and @entity16 to bring up baby @entity17			1
yet @entity18 has learned that despite all this – and the official protestations that @entity13 does indeed remain their long - term family home – the @entity19 have decided that they would rather be in @entity24			1

@entity69 may have only an ' apartment ' in the @entity13 - but with 20 rooms over four storeys , it 's hardly modest ‘ they enjoy the quiet life they can have there , and feel somewhat imprisoned in the @entity13			1
@entity75 is going to be perfect for a couple of years – that is the plan , ’ she explained			2
the @entity19 have already attracted controversy over the cost of @entity13 , not least when the @entity16 replaced the existing kitchen of their @entity65 residence – @entity87 at the @entity13 – at a cost of £ 170,000 , before opting to build a second one			1
