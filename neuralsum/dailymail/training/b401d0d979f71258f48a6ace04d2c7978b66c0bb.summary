royal method : @entity1 is reportedly considering hypnosis as a way of managing the pain of child birth without additional anesthetics @entity7 of @entity8 is reportedly considering hypnosis to deal with the pain of childbirth			1
the ‘ hypno - birth ’ would mean that her labour pains are lessened without using drugs , according to @entity15 magazine			2
advocates of the technique say that it helps women use their mind to seize control of the birthing process and learn techniques that allow the production of oxytocin , a pain relieving hormone which stimulates the uterus			2
women undergoing a hypno - birth may still use pain relief - such as an epidural , a pain - killing injection , many women find that they do n’t need any additional anaesthesia			1
@entity15 quoted a source who said : ‘ @entity1 has researched various birthing methods			2
' she wants it to be naturalso hypno - birthing is one option that appealed and she ahd been reading up on it and listening to cds to get into the right frame of mind			0
' some of her friends have used this method and swear by it			0
kate wants to do it her way and be relaxed			0
’ a royal spokeswoman said she was aware of the report , but declined to confirm or deny it			0
‘ we appreciate it ’s a happy occasion ... but there are some matters which should remain private to the duchess			0
’ if the story is true , @entity1 ’s tendency to set trends could lead many other women to follow her example			2
it is understood that the @entity1 is due to give birth in the private @entity69 wing at @entity70 in @entity71 , where prince @entity72 was born			1
@entity7 is believed to be taking prenatal yoga classes which focus on strengthening and increasing the flexibility of the muscles used during childbirth			1
she is also said to be keeping her fitness up with regular swimming sessions at @entity79			0
the @entity81 website which deal with hypno - birthing said in a blog that a number of hypno - birthing practitioners had ‘ spun ’ the news ‘ into a suggestion that the @entity1 is considering their particular approach			1
’ bump - in - waiting : @entity7 , pictured last week shopping in @entity91 's @entity90 , is said to have been inspired to go for a hypno - birth by her friends who have used the method but it added : ‘ regardless of the ultimate decision on natural birth techniques , i am grateful to the @entity7 for her willingness to explore options for a natural birth – especially as it was queen @entity104 who led the way for women to use drugs in labour			1
hypno - birthing encourages the father to become directly involved in the birth , something which is not exactly a traditional role for a royal father			1
the @entity116 says that the father acts as an ‘ anchor ’ throughout the birth			0
speaking on the website , @entity120 , a specialist , says the word ‘ hypno ’ actually does the technique a disservice			0
she adds : ‘ @entity126 helps you release the fears and gives you the tool so that your body can give birth efficiently and comfortably in the way it is designed to do			1
’ ‘ to have serious consideration from a well - educated , intelligent and progressive couple like @entity72 and @entity136 shows how far towards mainstream our profession has come over the last decade			0
