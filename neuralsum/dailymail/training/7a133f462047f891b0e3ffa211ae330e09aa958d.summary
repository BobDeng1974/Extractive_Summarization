@entity1 's hopes of taking part in next weekend 's @entity3 look doomed , even though her grandfather is ready to dip into his savings to help her become a @entity8 driver			1
@entity9 , 21 , from @entity10 , was in the reckoning to drive in the first practice session for @entity13 but the team 's administrators told @entity16 that they would sign two drivers for the full weekend rather than take on someone extra for one part of it			1
@entity1 was in reckoning to make her @entity8 debut for @entity13 in @entity23 next weekend @entity9 's grandfather offered to pay £ 35,000 for her to race in the first practice session @entity9 hoped to line up on the grid alongside fellow @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 @entity30 : the @entity31 became the first female to race in @entity8 at @entity33			1
@entity34 : another @entity31 , raced 17 times in 1974 - 76 and only female to achieve a top - six finish			2
@entity38 : the @entity39 was multi-talented , captaining women 's @entity41 ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix			0
desire @entity44 : @entity45 for home grand prix in @entity48 in 1981 , but retired after her car was damaged			0
@entity51 : @entity52 through @entity53 and f3000 ranks , though she never qualified for @entity8 grid			2
and the bid of £ 35,000 from @entity9 's grandfather is unlikely to be enough to secure her a race seat			1
' we have had five people show real interest in driving , ' said @entity64 , of administrators @entity65			0
' whichever two are picked will be involved in each practice session			0
' while @entity9 's chance looks to have gone , the door may yet open for another young @entity72 driver			1
@entity73 , son of former @entity8 driver dr @entity74 , is now a front - runner according to one well - placed source			1
@entity74 , 23 , certainly deserves his break after being crowned @entity79 champion last month , making him the first @entity72 winner of @entity8 's feeder series since @entity27 eight years ago			1
@entity13 's administrators launched a ' crowdfunding ' project last week in an attempt to raise enough money for the team to compete in @entity23 after missing the past two races			2
they are over halfway towards their £ 2.35m target but time is running out with the cars due to be transported this weekend			0
@entity64 said : ' i do believe we will be in @entity23 ' , adding that ' one individual and one group of investors have made contact about helping in the long term			0
@entity73 ( centre ) , son of former @entity8 driver dr @entity74 , is now a front - runner @entity9 's management are still working to secure her @entity102 super-licence in the hope she could yet get her chance			1
meanwhile , @entity107 has announced his departure from troubled @entity8 team @entity13 with immediate effect			1
@entity110 has already signed a contract to race for @entity112 in the 2015 season and will not now compete in the season finale in @entity23			0
the @entity115 had been forced to sit out the previous two races due to @entity13 going into administration , but the team is trying to crowd - source a return to the grid			2
in a statement posted on his official website , @entity110 said : ' following recent events re @entity127 and 1 @entity128 , my adviser @entity122 and i have decided to terminate , with immediate effect , all agreements connecting me to the @entity118			0
' this is a sad day as we have greatly enjoyed working with the team through a difficult and tough season			0
@entity134 boost for @entity135 as he edges out @entity27			0
