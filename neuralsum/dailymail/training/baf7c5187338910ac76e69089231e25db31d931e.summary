for more than a hundred years the traditional @entity1 milkman has been making doorstep deliveries			0
but now the daily pint is to be delivered by the @entity4 across much of the country			0
@entity7 - based @entity6 has sold all of its dairies and 3,000 milk floats to @entity12 ’s @entity11 for £ 80million			1
end of an era : @entity14 , chief executive of @entity6 , said it did n't matter who owns the company @entity11 – which sells dairy products around the world – will take control of four dairies at @entity22 , near @entity23 , @entity24 , east @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , in @entity29 , as well as around 70 depots			1
@entity14 , chief executive of @entity6 , said : ‘ it may be owned by a @entity4 firm but consumers love the milkman – it does n’t matter who owns the company			1
’ it marks an end of an era for @entity6 , as milk represented around 70 per cent of their business			1
the firm will now focus on their @entity6 butter and @entity45 cheese brands			1
mr @entity14 added : ‘ in the months ahead we will do all we can to minimise the uncertainty that we know today ’s news will bring for the many people associated with our business			0
’ @entity6 , @entity1 ’s largest dairy food company , has struggled to pass on higher raw milk prices it paid to farmers last year and has been losing customers to supermarket chains , which offer cheaper milk			1
the company ’s dairies swung to a loss of £ 4.4million for the six months to the end of september from a profit of £ 2.6million a year earlier			2
the deal adds to @entity11 ’s growing presence in the @entity1 dairy industry			2
in 2012 , the firm took over @entity66 ’s @entity65 and already owns nine dairies and ten depots nationwide , employing almost 6,000 people			2
@entity70 , chief executive of @entity11 & @entity71 , said : ‘ we are concerned that the dynamics of the @entity11 fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term			1
this acquisition will allow us to reduce our costs , increase our efficiencies and invest in the future			0
’ @entity6 is the latest in a string of once - proud @entity1 institutions sold to foreign firms			1
four years ago , @entity84 was sold to @entity87 processed cheese maker @entity85 while just this week @entity89 maker @entity88 was bought by a @entity91 firm			0
the @entity92 own @entity93 and the @entity94 own @entity96 ’s vinegar			0
in 2003 another @entity1 milk giant @entity97 suffered a similar period of poor profitability and was bought by @entity102 - @entity101 firm @entity100			2
they in turn sold it to @entity6 in 2006			2
the @entity1 milkman first appeared in the 1860s when the rail network meant fresh milk could be transported around the country cheaply and quickly , direct from the farm			0
milkmen took the milk door - to - door in churns on a three - wheeled ‘ milk pram ’			0
the pram has now evolved into an electric float and the milk is now decanted into pint bottles , but otherwise doorstep deliveries had , until now , withstood the tests of time .			0

@entity7 - based @entity6 has sold its dairies and milk floats to @entity11
@entity12 company will take control of four dairies as well as 70 depots
@entity6 will now focus on @entity6 butter and @entity45 brands
