the feet have been revealed to be the least appealing part of the anatomy by neuroscientists studying the links between sex and the brain			1
a study conducted jointly by @entity8 and the @entity9 in @entity10 found that feet were the lowest ranked of all 41 body parts in terms of sexual attractiveness , closely followed by kneecaps			1
the results , which debunked the commonly held theory that the feet have a sensual connection to the genitals , were published in neuroscientific journal @entity22 and a number of newspapers , including the @entity25			1
urgh ! feet were revealed to be the least appealing body part by neuroscientists in the @entity29 and @entity30 other findings included a male penchant for the backs of the legs ( although women were less impressed ) and also the hands - another body part that left the female sex drive unmoved			1
men were also revealed to have almost as many erogenous zones as women - a departure from the commonly held perception that they have just one ( the genitals )			1
' a lot of people assume that women 's bodies are just full of erogenous zones and that men only have one - the obvious one , ' professor @entity45 of @entity8 's @entity46 told the @entity25			1
females a woman 's mouth and lips was voted the most erotic body part with the highest rating of 7.9 out of 10			1
the nape of neck scored 7.5 out 10			2
nipples and breasts came in joint third with a rating of 7.3			2
bottoms came fourth with 4.5 out of 10			2
hips scored 3.5 and feet received a rating of just one out of 10			1
males the mouth and lips received the highest rating of seven out of 10			2
a man 's inner thigh received a rating of 5.8 out of 10			0
the nape of the neck scored 5.6			0
@entity78 received 4.8 out of 10			0
the lower back was rated as the fifth most erotic body part on a man with 2.8 out of 10			0
while the least erotic part of a man 's body was the forearm with a score of one out of 10			0
' but this is clearly not the case			0
it 's pretty equal , with just perhaps a modest advantage to women - but certainly nothing like the way sex differences have been so hugely exaggerated			2
' according to scientists , the results , which were collated from questioning 800 people in the @entity29 and @entity30 , were also remarkably consistent and held true regardless of race , gender and sexual orientation			0
the most popular body part was , inevitably , the genitals , followed by lips , ears , inner thighs , and the shoulder blades			1
' we have discovered from this that we all share the same erogenous zones in at least two very different continents , whether we are a white middle - aged woman sitting in a @entity113 office or a gay man living in a village in @entity30 , ' added professor @entity45			1
popular : lips topped the list after genitalia while the shoulder blades were found attractive by both sexes ' it suggests it is hardwired , built in , not based on cultural or life experiences			1
' thanks to the findings , scientists now suspect that sexual response is controlled by a different part of the brain to the sense of touch			0
@entity45 added : the @entity134 magazines of this world have been running half - baked surveys on this for years and years			0
' but we wanted to look at the question of why the side of the neck is interesting if nibbled but not the forehead or the head , which both have the same sensory receptors			0
as a result , @entity45 thinks that the sexual response may be controlled by the insula [ cortex ] , although he says that confirming his suspicions could be difficult			0
' there are a few ethical issues in trying to take the next step and measure that , as it obviously means that someone has to be stroking someone else whilst the brain is monitored , ' he added			0
it is highly unlikely , however , that feet will be involved in the process .			2
