the other sequence of events is a 13 - year - old girl carrying out acts of self harm taking photographs of her and having done so sending them to school friends with messages expressing thoughts of suicide and similar comments			1
a supportive message posted on the @entity167 website to @entity5 ' i find it difficult to believe that a 13 - year - old would understand the implications of what she was doing against a background of a young person who was clearly troubled or upset who had been self harming and who had had a disagreement with a young boy whom she had had some relations with			1
' i recognise that taking a large quantity of tablets may simply be an expression of the way she feels rather than a serious attempt to end her life			0
. in these circumstances i do n't believe for one minute @entity5 intended to kill herself			2
' what i think is a far more likely explanation is that what @entity5 did was either in the form of experimenting with tablets or an expression of her mood and unhappiness in the same way that she had been self harming			2
' it was a reflection of how she felt about herself and her relationship with the boy to whom she had been friends			2
i believe this was an impulsive act carried out shortly after a number of very brief internet searches			0
