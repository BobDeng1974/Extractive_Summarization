’ a twitter user called @entity106 wrote : ‘ @entity62 smoking weed is hot			1
i wan na try weed one day … ’ but despite the @entity59 yesterday making the band aware of the potentially harmful effect their actions have had on young fans , a @entity1 spokesman said their only comment was still : ‘ this matter is in the hands of our lawyers			1
’ @entity120 , of charity @entity121 , told the @entity59 : ‘ they ’ve got these young people that are hanging on to every word they say and instead of showing them how to behave , they are being the worst role models they could possibly be and encouraging young people to do something that could seriously damage their health			0
