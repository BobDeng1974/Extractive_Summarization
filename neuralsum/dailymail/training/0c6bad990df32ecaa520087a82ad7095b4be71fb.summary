when @entity3 was preparing to join @entity4 in 2011 , his @entity2 team - mate and close pal @entity0 told him : ‘ go to the @entity5 instead , it will suit your style far more ’			1
that advice will have come back to the 25 - year - old this summer as @entity4 usher him towards the exit to make way for @entity12			1
to say @entity3 has failed at the @entity13 would be wrong : last season only @entity14 scored more goals for @entity4 in @entity17 and only @entity18 and @entity19 managed more in the entire division , but he has struggled to fit the @entity4 mould			1
‘ i had to learn how to play football again			0
i could n’t do what i did in @entity42 , ’ he told @entity39 last year			2
@entity43 was a fan because he saw in him someone who could play with his back to goal holding the ball up but who also had the pace to be played in behind a rivals ’ defence			0
but the job demanded sacrifice — no longer could he live up to the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) nickname given to him in @entity42 as he took @entity2 by storm , having arrived from @entity57 in 2008 , where he won the league under @entity60			1
at times he struggled against defences that always sit deep against @entity4 , allowing little space behind			1
‘ sometimes i want to take people on but because the opposition is defending so deep i ca n’t and so i have to just play a pass back into midfield , ’ he said			0
there was also less scope for him to dominate and go where he saw fit on the pitch , as he did for @entity2 and for the national team			0
when he said , ‘ i work three times as hard for the @entity23 team as i do for @entity4 ’ , he was n’t revealing a lazy side to his game , he was just illustrating how at the club there was far less freedom for him to move around the pitch			1
at @entity26 or @entity25 , @entity82 or @entity83 will be more willing to play to his tune			1
he will have the lead role that was never possible at @entity4 alongside @entity14			2
away from the spotlight of one of @entity89 ’s most glamorous club he will also be more comfortable off the pitch			0
he is famous for being at a publicity shoot in @entity92 once and failing to notice the club ’s chief executive @entity93 at the table of a top city restaurant			0
the glitz of football ’s who ’s who tends to pass him by			0
youngster : @entity102 was advised to move to the @entity5 as a youngster , but chose @entity4 instead @entity104 studded : he has struggled to make an impact in a @entity4 team containing @entity14 up top @entity12 vs @entity3 forget the claims that he might struggle to adapt in @entity110			1
those who know him well from his @entity113 days say he is so driven and ambitious that he does n’t choose a city to live in , instead he chooses a coach to play for			0
‘ @entity43 made me feel like a @entity118 , ’ he said of the @entity4 coach who left only one season after @entity3 arrived			1
if a @entity5 coach can make him feel special again and can persuade him that he will be go back to being the @entity3 of old – the @entity120 where he still returns every summer to see old friends , then he will be convinced			1
and if he joins @entity25 or @entity26 this summer , while he might not drag them single - handedly to within a whisker of the league title scoring 31 goals along the way , he will bring many of the same qualities possessed by @entity12			1
main man : @entity83 ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) would build their teams around the 25 - year - old jump for joy : his nickname when growing up in @entity23 was ' squirrel ' , as he was always climbing trees his nickname as a boy growing up in @entity137 in northern @entity23 was ‘ squirrel ’ because he was always climbing trees or scaling buildings to retrieve lost footballs			1
he has that @entity142 on the pitch			0
it has been suppressed at @entity4 and it needs to be tapped into again			2
he will run all day for the cause , as one of the most famous stories from his days in @entity42 demonstrates			0
he lived near @entity2 ’s @entity149 outside the city			0
one day he drove into the centre to go shopping and managed to lose his keys			0
instead of asking to be picked up or to be given a lift home he simply ran the four miles home to get a spare set of keys and then ran back to his car			0
understand why that seemed the most logical thing for him to do and you begin to understand @entity3			2
the speed , skill and agression shown in his third season at @entity4 will mean some supporters are against the sale			2
he has suitors in @entity42 where he still has a home			0
but the @entity5 is calling and it seems this time he is about to listen to the advice of his friend @entity172			2
shines in @entity110 : @entity3 scored a goal against the @entity174 at @entity175 last year on his way : will he be waving goodbye to @entity178 soon ?			1

@entity25 are *interested* in signing @entity3 for *£* *32m*
@entity26 hoping to incorporate a deal into @entity12 transfer to @entity4
25 - year - old *'s* style suits the @entity5
