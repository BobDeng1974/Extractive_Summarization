chief superintendent @entity30 , of @entity7 , said : ' this is was an unbelievably stupid act of criminality which was extremely dangerous , not only for the police helicopter , but all other aircraft that use the nearby @entity11 airfields and the wider public			1
' had this flare caused an emergency situation it would not only have been catastrophic for the aircraft and its crew but potentially for numerous homes near the airfield , the @entity43 and a childrenâ € ™ s residential facility			1
' the protest camp appears to be a tight knit group who seem to be continually filming anything occurring on @entity50			2
' if one of the protesters is responsible , i suspect their identity will be known to others and i would expect those reasonable members of the anti-fracking campaign to provide any information they have to the police			1
' the camp was set up last month after gas company @entity61 received permission to start exploratory drilling for the controversial extraction process			2

the process is only at a test phase in @entity114 , but has already come under intense scrutiny			0
chief @entity116 added : ' an attack on the police of this nature has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not exploratory drilling is right or wrong			2
' whilst i recognise the genuine concerns of many of the protesters in relation to exploratory drilling , it is obvious that there is also an element of regular protesters from outside the @entity132 area who seem more interested in seeking confrontation with the police			1
' @entity7 continue to balance facilitating peaceful protest with the rights of others to go about their lawful business , whilst minimising disruption to the local community and businesses			2
' because of the way the camp is set up we have to systematically search the site under a warrant issued by a local court			1

she added : ' it 's just an excuse to go into the camp			2
' all along the behaviour of @entity7 has been outrageous			0
' they have been really aggressive and removed people 's right to protest from them			0
' more than 40 per cent of @entity114 could be opened up for fracking as the hunt for shale gas gathers pace @entity198 , who is currently living at the site , said : ' no flare was fired from this camp on saturday or any other day			1
' we would condem any such action as aggressive , violent and in breach of our very strict safe spaces policy			0
' we are peaceful people who wish to stop the destruction of this land by @entity61 and all of the other fracking companies			2

anyone seen firing a flare would have been asked to leave the camp and report themselves to the authorities ' - @entity153 , spokesman for @entity154 ' the behaviour of @entity7 has been outrageous throughout this whole campaign			1
