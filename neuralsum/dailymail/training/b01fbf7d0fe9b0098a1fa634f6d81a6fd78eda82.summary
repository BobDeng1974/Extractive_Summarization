he expressed the view that the canal incident was not an accident			0
' he expressed his concern that it was his belief that his son had tried to kill him and his wife when he had driven the car into the canal			0
' he gave a number of reasons for this belief			0
he was due to see his son later that day and he was intending to confront him about it but no meeting appear to have taken place			0
