by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 17:18 est , 19 december 2012 packs of ten cigarettes could be banned under a @entity4 proposal to crack down on smoking			1
the @entity7 ’s @entity6 also unveiled plans to ban menthol cigarettes and to force companies to cover three quarters of their packets with a picture warning			1
the idea is to make smoking less attractive to children , who are more likely to buy smaller packets of cigarettes with their pocket money			2
youngsters are also more likely to buy flavoured cigarettes such as menthol and strawberry			2
smoking : the @entity7 will not force all cigarettes to be sold in plain packets with graphic health warnings , as is now required in @entity28 , but individual governments will be free to insist on such packaging if they wish last night the @entity31 in @entity32 said ministers were considering the proposals , which will have to be agreed by all @entity4 ’s health ministers before they can go ahead			1
the @entity7 wants the new rules to come into force across the continent by 2016			0
under the proposals , packs of less than 20 cigarettes would be banned , as would ‘ slim ’ cigarettes			1
e-cigarettes , which are used by many people wanting to quit the habit , would also have to carry health warnings for the first time , because they contain nicotine			1
the moves were announced by @entity51 @entity7 commissioner @entity50 to reinforce an existing tobacco products directive			0
negotiations over the controversial plans have taken place with the tobacco industry and health campaigners for years , and they target the use in cigarettes , roll - ups and ‘ smokeless tobacco products ’ flavoured with menthol , vanilla and strawberry			1
such ‘ characterising flavours ’ will be banned under the new legislation , if approved by @entity66 and @entity7 health ministers			1
current pictorial health warnings will more than double in size and the rules will extend to products not specifically covered so far , such as ‘ electronic ’ cigarettes and herbal smoking products			1
chewing and nasal tobacco will have to have specific labelling and controls on ingredients			0
dr @entity50 said : ‘ the @entity79 had promised a proposal on tobacco products by the end of 2012 , and that ’s what i ’m presenting today			0
plans : the draft @entity79 legislation said the proposal ' foresees that combined warnings ( picture plus text ) of 75 per cent should be displayed on both sides of the packages of tobacco products ' ‘ the figures speak for themselves : tobacco kills half of its users and is highly addictive			1
with 70 per cent of the smokers starting before the age of 18 , the ambition of today ’s proposal is to make tobacco products and smoking less attractive and thus discourage tobacco initiation among young people			2
’ he added : ‘ consumers must not be cheated : tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products and this proposal ensures that attractive packaging and flavourings are not used as a marketing strategy			0
’ current rules are now more than a decade old and outdated , the @entity79 said			0
significant changes have taken place , such as new scientific evidence on the impact of flavourings used in tobacco , and clearer statistics about the effectiveness of health warnings			2
novel products such as electronic cigarettes have joined the sector , and @entity126 is concerned about the continued use of what it calls ‘ attractive ’ packaging and flavours			2
the new proposed labelling rules would require a combined picture and text health warning covering 75 per cent of the front and the back of cigarette packs			1
current information on tar , nicotine and carbon monoxide - now considered misleading - would be replaced by a warning on the side of each pack noting that tobacco smoke contains more than 70 cancer - causing substances			0
choice : seventy per cent of smokers start to smoke before 18			2
@entity7 health and consumer commissioner said ' the ambition is to discourage tobacco among young people			0
' newly - developed electronic cigarettes , used by many smokers as a healthier alternative , would have to carry health warnings , as they contain nicotine			1
if the nicotine content is above a certain threshold they would not be allowed unless authorised by a doctor as medicine , like nicotine replacement therapies			0
even herbal cigarettes would have to carry health warnings			1
the plans will now be considered by the @entity170 and @entity7 health ministers , with a target of adopting the new laws during 2014 and bringing them into force in 2016			1
the rules stop short of imposing plain packaging as has recently been introduced in @entity28			0
but individual e governments would be free to impose them if they wished			0
a spokesman for @entity180 - based @entity179 , @entity4 ’s biggest cigarette producer and a subsidiary of @entity182 , said the draft proposals were in breach of @entity186 and @entity4 law			2
‘ this is plain packaging by the back door , and by that token it is a deep intrusion into the intellectual property rights and trademark rights of the manufacturer , ’ she said			0
‘ it destroys brand values that companies have built up over time			0
’ last night , the @entity31 in @entity32 said ministers are considering the plan .			0

proposals will have to be agreed by all @entity4 *'s* health ministers
plans will also ban ' slim ' cigarettes and require packs are 75 per cent covered with warnings / / e-cigarettes will also have to carry warnings
