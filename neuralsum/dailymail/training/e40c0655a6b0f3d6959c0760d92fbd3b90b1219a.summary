a successful researcher and science writer was asked to contribute to an obscure blog , but when she turned down the offer she was accused of being a ' whore			1
' dr. @entity5 , a post-doctoral fellow in zoology at @entity7 , was asked via email on friday to write a science blog for biology - online.com by an editor who went only by ' @entity12			1
@entity13 has since posted lengthy written and video responses to @entity12 on the widely read @entity15 site , including screen grabs of her email interactions with the blog editor			1
the interaction with goes pleasantly enough at first			0
@entity12 asked @entity13 to contribute to ' one of the largest biology websites ' in order to gain exposure			1

@entity13 , whose blog is dubbed ' the urban scientist : a hip hop maven blogs on urban ecology , evolutionary biology & diversity in the sciences ' was n't specific in her reasons for not wanting to work with @entity12			1
nor was she soliciting another email from him			0
but she got one anyway			0
‘ because we do n’t pay for blog entries , ’ asked @entity12			2
‘ are you an urban scientist or an urban whore ? ’ @entity13 's response was quick and the wide internet exposure was immediate			1
' did you just call me a whore ? ' : @entity13 blogs on the widely read @entity15 site			2
she turned down the unpaid job and an editor named @entity12 asked ' are you an urban scientist or an urban whore ? ' write caption here ' thank you very much for your reply , ' wrote @entity13 in response			1
' but i will have to decline your offer			0
' offended : @entity13 's blog , called @entity79 is focused on urban science outreach			1
as a black woman , she took particular offense to ' @entity12 's ' accusations and created a widely viewed online response ' if you ¿ re a woman , a person of color , or from a lower socio - economic status , folks think they can get you , your talent , your expertise , and your energy for free , ' said @entity13			2
' that ¿ s not available			0

' ' i pimp game , ' @entity13 said in her video response			2
' i know how this works			0
' she was referring to the game of scientific research and blogging			0
but she could have just as easily meant the internet revenge game			0
' if you ’re a woman , a person of color , or from a lower socio - economic status , folks think they can get you , your talent , your expertise , and your energy for free , ' said @entity13			2
' that ’s not available			0
so i hope you know that from now on			0

@entity13 ended her video to biology - online and @entity12 with a smirk : ' @entity128 ’ll have a good day			1
' ' @entity128 'll have a good day ! ' : @entity13 ended her indignant response with a sarcastic adieu , but @entity12 will definitely not be having a good day			2
since his comments and @entity13 's viral response , the blog editor has been fired from biology - online.com			1

dr. @entity5 was asked to contribute to biology - online.org but turned it down , in part because it did n't pay
a blog editor referred to as ' @entity12 ' responded by *insinuating* @entity13 , whose own blog is called @entity79 , is an ' urban whore '
@entity13 's written and video response has since gone viral and @entity12 was fired
