by @entity0 @entity1 chose to have a preventative operation after discovering she carried the killer @entity5 gene - only to be told she already had cancer she lost her mother to cancer , and watched her sister fight the disease			1
the heartache prompted @entity1 to take action , determined to face the killer head on and do all she could to stop it in its path			2
doctors advised the 58 - year - old to have a preventative hysterectomy after tests revealed she carried a killer cancer gene , predisposing her to the disease			1
but when surgeons carried out the operation they discovered ms @entity1 already had ovarian cancer - which would otherwise could have gone unnoticed until it was too late			1
ms @entity1 , from @entity25 in @entity26 , said : ' i was totally in shock , it was not what i had expected			2
' i thought i was doing this to prevent the cancer but i already had it			2
' i was showing no symptoms so it would have gone unnoticed until it was too late			0
' if my mum had n’t died of cancer we would never have tested our genes when my sister @entity39 was diagnosed			1
it ’s thanks to my mum that i ’m still here			0
' ms @entity1 , a radiographic assistant , found that she possessed a killer cancer gene after her sister @entity39 was diagnosed with cancer , which is linked to breast cancer			1
seven of ms @entity1 ’s sisters decided to get tested for the life - threatening gene @entity5 , as their mother and grandmother had died of breast cancer			1
ms @entity1 was one of the four sisters to receive the life - changing news			1
the @entity55 worker said : ' i was devastated			0
the gene makes you 90 per cent likely to get cancer			2
' so when the doctor told me i carried it , i asked straight away for a hysterectomy			0
' as soon as she discovered she had the gene , ms @entity1 immediately requested a preventative hysterectomy			1
ms @entity1 ( left ) underwent her preventative hysterectomy at the same time as her sister @entity65 ( right )			1
after losing their mother to cancer , ms @entity1 and her six sisters were tested for the gene - four were found to be carriers a woman 's risk of developing breast and / or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a harmful mutation of the @entity77 or @entity5 gene			1
men who inherit the genes also have an increased risk of breast cancer , and both men and woman with the genes may face a greater risk of developing other cancers			0
genetic tests can check for @entity77 and @entity5 mutations , in people with a family history of cancer that suggests the presence of the genes			1
if the harmful mutations are found , patients face several options to help manage their risk of cancer , including preventative surgery			1
last may @entity99 star @entity98 revealed she had undergone a preventative double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing the disease			1
her mother @entity103 died of cancer in 2007			1
@entity98 , a mother of six and partner of @entity105 , said she took the decision to have the procedure because she found she carries @entity77 , which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer			1
source : @entity111 on january 8 , 2013 , she went in to @entity114 ’s @entity113 for her hysterectomy with her sister @entity65 , who also carried the gene			2
she said : ' we walked hand in hand into that hospital and our beds lay next to each other			0
' before our operations i was crying and she climbed straight into my bed where we cried together			0
' having her there got me through			0
' her sister @entity65 added : ' it ’s a massive thing having a hysterectomy so we wanted to go in together			0
' we needed to grab this by the bones and say " i will not be a victim "			0
' but for ms @entity1 , the operation was not the preventative surgery she had expected			1
she said : ' during the operation , they found a cyst on my ovaries			2
' they sent it off to be tested and it came back positive			0
' i already had cancer of the ovaries and the dreaded gene had caused it			2
' not in my wildest dreams could that have happened			0
' ms @entity1 had shown no signs of the cancer and her symptoms would have carried on unnoticed			2
without being tested and going for the operation ms @entity1 's ( pictured with her son @entity154 , who was found to carry the gene , and her two grandsons ) tumour could have gone unnoticed , lying undiscovered until it was too late she said : ' i was told that in a couple of years time if my symptoms began to show , it would have been too late			1
' i am just so thankful me and my sisters had that chance to get tested			2
' my mum did n’t , but it ’s thanks to her we ’ve been saved			0
' ms @entity1 started a course of chemotherapy to kill off the disease and the results were exactly what she was hoping for			2
' if my mum had n’t died of cancer we would never have tested our genes ' - @entity1 she said : ' my bloods showed that i was in remission			1
it was a fantastic day			0
' ms @entity1 returned to work cancer - free but still had another preventative operation to endure			1
' the only way to prevent getting breast cancer with this gene is to have a bilateral mastectomy , ' she said			2
' i had already diced with death once , i did n’t want to do it again			0
' so on march 14 , i went in once more for the mastectomy			0
' all six of my sisters were by my side as i went through what i hope will be my last surgery			0
' @entity192 may have taken my mum , but he left me with six wonderful sisters			2
ms @entity1 , 58 , said : ' if my mum had n't died of cancer we would never have tested our genes when my sister @entity39 was diagnosed			1
it 's thanks to my @entity200 ( pictured on her wedding day ) that i 'm still here ' ' i always have six strong , powerful women behind me			0
whether one of us has the gene or not we are all in it together			0
' ms @entity1 is now recovering from her double mastectomy at home with peace of mind			1
she said : ' all of the breast tissue they removed came back clear			0
' i can put that gene to bed now because i ’ve removed all the bits it can get			0
' ms @entity1 ’s two daughters have thankfully not been passed on the gene - but her son @entity154 , 38 , was one of the unlucky ones			1
she said : ' i am not going to let it worry me because i know he will be protected and screened			0
' it took my mum and i ’m not letting it take any more of us			0

@entity1 was tested for the gene after her mother died of cancer
after opting for a preventative hysterectomy doctors , found the mother - of - three had already developed a cancerous ovarian tumour
58 - year - old has since had a double mastectomy operation
four of her six sisters were also found to carry the @entity5 gene
her daughters are clear were given the all clear but her son is a carrier
she said : ' if my mum had n't died of cancer we would never have got tested '
