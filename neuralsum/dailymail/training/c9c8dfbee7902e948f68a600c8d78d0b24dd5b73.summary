by @entity0 if you found yourself overindulging to the point of tipsiness during the hot spell , you ’re in good company … with seagulls			1
experts say the birds are becoming ‘ drunk ’ by gorging on flying ants , which have been leaving their nests early due to the heat			1
councils around the country have started to take action to control the birds , which have been dive - bombing at people on the street and creating a mess by rummaging through bin bags to find food			0
how did i get up here ? @entity23 's seagulls have been getting ' drunk ' by eating flying ants it is believed that the gulls have been acting strangely because the formic acid in the ants ’ bodies has been reacting with their stomachs			1
dr @entity29 from the @entity30 , told the @entity31 : ‘ some of the slightly odd behaviour we are seeing could be as a result of these ants – it could leave the gulls slightly drunk			1
‘ it ’s possible because we know that some ants produce formic acid , and it could be having an effect			1
there have certainly been many , many more of them this summer			0
‘ the gulls can also get very excited and loud when they eat the ants , so that could be a contributing factor			2
’ last week in @entity45 , @entity44 the city council launched a campaign against the seagull attacks by targeting ‘ known feeders ’ of the birds			2
councillor @entity50 said : ‘ we ’ve seen a steady rise in the number of gulls and people complaining about their behaviour			0
’ while residents in @entity58 , @entity56 complained after dive - bombing seagulls turned their street into ‘ something out of @entity62 ’			1
gull expert @entity63 said seagulls have been moving into urbanised areas for years , so complaints about their bad behaviour came as ‘ no surprise ’			1
he said : ‘ it ’s the sheer number of gulls in built up areas now			0
they are right in our faces , and they are not scared			0
‘ the pest control industry has been trying their best , but they ca n’t outsmart seagulls			2
‘ people are trying anything - spikes , tension wires – i even saw a plastic eagle owl once			0
‘ but they are wasting money on this stuff because seagulls are just too clever			2
’ the seaside town , @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 , introduced a range of ‘ bird - proof ’ bags this summer to combat the problem of the seagulls eating waste food			1
the town clerk @entity93 , said @entity85 had become ‘ an all - you - can - eat buffet for the birds ’			0
he continued : ‘ we get so many complaints about them			0
they have just become a general nuisance			0
