by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 @entity2 today publicly snubbed @entity3 after thanking every @entity5 mp who campaigned against @entity7 independence – apart from the former @entity5 leader			1
mr @entity2 made an impromptu speech at the @entity5 conference to hail the efforts of those who defeated @entity13 last week			2
he welcomed onto the stage in @entity15 a host of mps while heaping praise on @entity5 activists and trade unionists who campaigned for the ‘ no ’ to independence group			1
but mr @entity2 pointedly failed to mention the former prime minister , whose intervention has been credited with helping to shore up leaking support for the @entity25 in the final weeks of the campaign			1
former prime minister @entity3 was credited with helping to get the ' no ' to independence campaign back on track it came after mr @entity2 yesterday shot down the suggestion of a return to the front bench for the former prime minister following his political come back during the referendum			1
mr @entity3 was acknowledged by @entity34 , the shadow scottish secretary , who said he had ‘ electrified this campaign ’			2
mr @entity3 intervened in the final week before polling day to bring together the main @entity38 political leaders to sign a joint ‘ vow ’ promising new powers for @entity7			1
@entity13 has since claimed that the no campaign ’s last minute promise of more powers for @entity44 , orchestrated by mr @entity3 , was crucial in winning the referendum for the ‘ no ’ campaign			1
but @entity5 leader mr @entity2 refused to acknowledge his predecessor ’s impact			2
speaking in @entity15 this afternoon , he said he particularly wanted to thank ‘ all of the people in the @entity50 ’ who helped defeat independence			0
he praised @entity7 @entity5 leader @entity53 , her deputy @entity54 and @entity56 chairman @entity57			2
mr @entity2 also thanked shadow ministers @entity34 , @entity59 and @entity60 – as well as the @entity50 and the @entity7 trade unionists in general			1
mr @entity57 , who led the @entity63 , also spoke during the session to attack mr @entity13 for failing to accept the result of last week ’s referendum			2
he also accused defeated @entity67 leader mr @entity13 of having ‘ lost the plot ’ for claiming @entity7 could declare independence without a referendum it came after mr @entity13 claimed ‘ a referendum is only one of a number of routes ’ to independence			0
better together chairman @entity57 was applauded for his efforts keeping the @entity25 together at the @entity5 conference today - but mr @entity3 was absent and unacknowledged @entity80 presenter @entity79 performed an impression of mr @entity3 during his interview with @entity2 yesterday			1
he asked the @entity5 leader if he would be prepared to give the former @entity84 a job - but mr @entity2 said it was not on the cards but addressing the @entity5 conference in @entity15 , mr @entity57 said : ‘ apparently , the first minister of @entity7 said today while he 'd lost the referendum , never mind , he might be able to seize power some other way			1
’ he added : ‘ i just say to mr @entity13 - you lost the argument , you lost the referendum , you 've lost office , and now you 've lost the plot			2
the people of @entity7 are sovereign and the people of @entity7 have said ‘ no thanks ’ to separation and you must accept that result			0
’ mr @entity13 has accused @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity2 of reneging on their word to hand @entity7 more powers			1
mr @entity13 said despite last week ’s referendum defeat the ‘ writing is on the wall ’ for the @entity25			0
mr @entity13 said : ‘ i think the destination is pretty certain , we are only now debating the timescale and the method			0
’ interviewed on @entity116 , mr @entity13 said : ‘ there are a whole range of ways @entity7 can improve its position in pursuit of @entity7 independence			0
’ he added : ‘ i think referendums are great , they have been my policy and even i have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement , but of course for many years there was a ‘ gradualist ’ attitude to independence			0
‘ that is to say you establish a parliament , you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you ’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent			0
many countries have proceeded through that route			0
‘ there is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes			0
‘ i think it ’s the best route incidentally , that ’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many			0

former prime minister has been credited with saving the ' no ' campaign
mr @entity3 intervened to rally ailing @entity163 team with just weeks to go
