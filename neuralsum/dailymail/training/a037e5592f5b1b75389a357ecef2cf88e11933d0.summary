phone hacking and other illegal information gathering was mostly committed on behalf of law firms , telecom companies and insurers – not by journalists , it has emerged			1
the @entity7 knew that businesses other than journalists hired criminals to access people ’s voicemails six years ago , but did nothing to intervene , according to a report by the agency			1
one of the main ‘ hackers ’ involved in the practice said 80 per cent of companies hiring criminals to hack phones were law firms , wealthy individuals and insurance companies , according to the report			2
one of the individuals was ‘ a celebrity who broadcasts to millions every week ’			0
' cover - up ' : @entity27 knew about an explosive report on phone - hacking but did not reveal its existence in the report issued by his inquiry just 20 per cent of hackers ’ clients were in the media – which came under fierce scrutiny from the @entity27 inquiry , costing taxpayers £ 6million			1
the other corrupt practices mentioned in the report included live phone interceptions , police corruption , computer hacking and perverting the course of justice			1
@entity7 ’s findings were privately presented to the @entity27 inquiry in 2012 , but the report was not made public or included in the @entity49			1
@entity51 mp @entity50 said : ‘ what is astonishing about this whole murky affair is that @entity7 had knowledge of massive illegal invasions of privacy in the newspaper industry – but also in the supply chains of so - called blue - chip companies			2
he said : ‘ i believe they are sitting on physical evidence that has still not been disclosed fully to forensic investigators at the @entity64			0
the law should also be rigorously applied to other sectors that have got away with it			0
’ police investigations reviewed by @entity7 found that 20 per cent of calls in the reports were being listened to by private detectives in real time			2
anger : mp @entity50 called for the report to be shared in order to uncover wrongdoing the report , seen by @entity79 , said a ‘ telephone interception specialist manufactured several devices which were physically attached to the target ’s landline at the relevant signal box by a @entity86 - trained telecommunications engineer ’			1
a document entitled the @entity88 was unearthed by another police inquiry			2
it gave advice on accessing personal details held by companies , banks , @entity95 , councils , utility providers and the @entity98			0
an extract said : ‘ it is probably a good idea to overcome any moral hang - ups you might have about “ snooping ” or “ dishonesty ”			1
the fact is that through learning acts of technical deception , you will be performing a task which is not only of value to us or our client , but to industry as a whole			0
’ the source who was aware of the report , codenamed @entity116 said clients who hired illegal private investigators included a major telecoms company , a celebrity broadcaster , a media personality and a businessman negotiating a £ 500million takeover			1
but the most prolific clients were law firms , particularly those involved in lucrative marriage and fraud litigation			2
the criminals , who were paid as much as £ 14,000 to hack phones and track bank transactions , were found to be ‘ developing and cultivating useful relationships ’ through ‘ socialising with law enforcement personnel ’			0
despite the trade in criminality identified in the report , which dates back to 2006 , none of the offenders hired to perform the illegal snooping was charged with criminal offences until after the phone hacking scandal			1
@entity51 mp @entity142 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ i am deeply concerned about these revelations			0
i will be seeking an explanation from @entity7 as to why this was not told to the committee when we took evidence from them about the issue of private investigators			0
‘ it is important we establish how widespread this practice was and why no action was taken to stop what amounted to criminal activity			0
’ a @entity7 spokesman told @entity79 : ‘ @entity7 produced a confidential report in 2008 on the issue of licensing the private investigation industry			1
this report remains confidential and @entity7 does not comment on leaked documents			0

vast majority of phone hacking was not carried out by newspapers
secret report was given to @entity27 inquiry but they did not act on it
