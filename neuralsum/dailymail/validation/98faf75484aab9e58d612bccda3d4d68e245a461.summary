but the anthology does n't take jabs at those who 've decided to have children , rather it takes a look at how others have come to the decision that parenthood is not for them in a culture that worships parenthood			0
being honest : @entity15 edited 16 writers ' essays about their decision to forgo having children in her new book @entity42 , @entity11 , and self - absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids just the two of us : ms @entity15 , who does n't have children , posed for this selfie with her husband ' these essays have so many people talking about the ways that they do have relationships with kids , nieces or nephews or kids that they mentor , ' ms @entity15 told @entity59			1
she added : ' you ’ve heard the cliché " it takes a village " , but there are so many ways of being a responsible villager			0
' the writers who contributed to the book candidly explained about how they came to the decision to live a child - free existence without judgement - which is a refreshing take on a unnecessarily controversial choice that is often met with confusion and criticism			1
for her book , ms @entity15 sought out the perspective of both men and women , although a majority of the essays in the collection are from female writers			1
' i think we could be wary of the assumption that parenthood is the only way to be an adult , ' ms @entity15 told the outlet , noting that ' it 's less taboo to say , " i 'm a shallow person " than to say that this is n't for me			2
' major debut : ms @entity15 's new collection of essays will be published on tuesday while most conversations about parenting revolve around how women ' can have it all , ' this book suggests that maybe they do n't want to - or even need to			1

most of the writers featured in the anthology are over the age of 30 , ms @entity15 said she ' did not have an age cutoff ' , but noted that it would be difficult to have someone in her twenties make a public declaration that she would never have children			2
ms @entity15 wrote about her own choice not to have children in an essay titled @entity127 , which appeared the @entity128 : and other subjects of @entity130 , her collection of persona essays that was published last year			0
' after more than a decade of being told that i ’d wake up one morning at age 30 or 33 - or , @entity135 forbid , 40 - to the ear - splitting peals of my biological clock , i would still look at a woman pushing a stroller and feel no envy at all , only relief that i was n’t her , ' she recalled in @entity127			0
throughout the essay , ms @entity15 recounted getting pregnant , miscarrying the baby and subsequently deciding that she did n't want to be a mother			0
in her new book , ms @entity15 does n't touch upon her own life with children beyond the introduction			0
