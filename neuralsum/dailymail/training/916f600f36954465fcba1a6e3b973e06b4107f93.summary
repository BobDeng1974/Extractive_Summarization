@entity0 today unveiled a ' soak the rich ' budget that hammered big business and the wealthy in a high - risk strategy ' to get the country back on the rails '			1
@entity7 – @entity0 ’s first @entity9 president since @entity10 in the 1980s – outlined a £ 24 billion austerity package in the harshest budget for 30 years			1
but to the dismay of business leaders who fear an exodus of top talent , the centrepiece was a 75 per cent super-tax on incomes over £ 800,000 a year			0
taxman : president @entity7 claims the spending plan for next year would win the ' battle ' against joblessness there was also a new 45 per cent band for earning over £ 120,000 and business lost a series of tax breaks			1
critics said it risked driving entrepreneurs and the wealthy overseas – including to @entity32 – and voiced alarm over the decision to impose £ 16 billion of tax rises and just £ 8 billion of spending cuts			1
but @entity0 prime minister @entity37 insisted it was ' a fighting budget to get the country back on the rails '			1
he said : ' it is a budget which aims to bring back confidence and to break this spiral of debt that gets bigger and bigger			0
' it 's true we ’re asking for an effort of the richest , the top 10 per cent and the top one per cent in particular			0
' @entity50 companies pay less than the small companies and sometimes do n't pay at all			0
so we ’re asking them for an effort too			0
' confirmation of the 75 per cent super-tax – the highest rate anywhere in the world , which by the government ’s own figures will only raise £ 160million next year – is likely to cause a stir in @entity61			2
in june , @entity62 promised to ' roll out the red carpet and welcome more @entity0 businesses to @entity65 ' if the tax hike went ahead			2
the comments sparked a furious reaction in @entity0 but business leaders warned that mr @entity7 is doing untold damage to the economy			1
@entity72 , head of the @entity73 in @entity0 , said austerity should have been more balanced towards spending cuts			1
' @entity0 is sick because of the model it has but is choosing to preserve it , ' he said			2
' the government is impeding investment and so will block innovation			0
' @entity80 : the tax announcement for the top 10 per cent of earners in @entity0 will see many of ' the most talented @entity0 workers ' heading to @entity32 , it is claimed dr @entity84 , a senior lecturer in sociology at @entity86 and an expert on the migration of highly - skilled workers from @entity0 to @entity32 , said @entity65 stood to benefit from the super-tax			1
' the tax announcement for the top 10 per cent of earners in @entity0 will lead to an exodus of some of the most talented @entity0 workers to @entity32 , ’ he said			1
' many highly skilled @entity0 workers are attracted by the @entity65 ’s economic and political model , and @entity32 is the prime destination for them and this rise will exacerbate this			1
' @entity101 , a partner at law firm @entity102 , said the @entity0 are already seeking advice on coming to the @entity65			2
' we may need to spruce up @entity65 's red carpet for the @entity0 sooner rather than later , given president @entity7 's latest announcement , ' she said			1
' since monsieur @entity7 's election we have seen a definite , and strong , increase in @entity0 individuals and corporates investigating the best , and most tax - efficient way to relocate to the @entity65 and minimise their @entity0 tax burden			1
' typically , we are asked how to avoid becoming @entity65 - resident for tax purposes , but it in this case @entity65 residence is highly favourable , whereas @entity0 tax ties are seen as a burden			2
' mr @entity7 swept to power in on an anti-austerity and pro-growth ticket but his approval rating has plummeted since he took office in the summer			0
the @entity0 economy is on the verge of recession having stagnated for the last nine months and unemployment has soared to its highest level this century			1
with the @entity0 national debt at a post-war record of 91 per cent of national income , any hopes that mr @entity7 would water down austerity were quickly dashed			2
as well as hiking taxes on the wealthy and targeting big business , the government froze government spending as it battled to get the country 's finances back under control			1
finance minister @entity143 said the ' unprecedented ' budget was needed to cut the deficit from nearly £ 70 billion or 4.5 per cent of national income this year to 3 per cent next year			2
' the 3 per cent target is vital for the credibility of the country , ' he said			0
' we are committed to it and we will meet it			0
' but economists are sceptical about the government ’s ability to meet the target – particularly as it is based on the assumption that the @entity0 economy will grow by 0.8 per cent in 2013 and 2 per cent in 2014 despite the debt storm tearing through the eurozone			1
' the 3 per cent target is not possible , ' said @entity161 , chief economist at credit insurer @entity162			0
' i do n’t believe they ’ll make it			0
' @entity166 , an economist at fund manager @entity167 , said : ' i have a hard time seeing how we ’re going to find the necessary growth in 2013 and afterwards			0
' mr @entity7 's soak the rich policies have already sparked a backlash in @entity0			1
@entity174 , chief executive of @entity175 , the world ’s biggest cosmetics company , this week said it would be ' very , very difficult to attract talent to work in @entity0 ' if taxes are hiked			2
earlier this month , @entity180 , head of the luxury goods group @entity181 , admitted he had applied for @entity183 citizenship			0
@entity184 , chief economist at investment manager @entity185 , said : ' the government has understood that the increase in the public debt has got to be halted but the way that they are doing it is not the right way			0
' it amounts to strongly increasing the tax burden on companies , their shareholders and executives , in other words those who create added value			0
' it will lead to an even bigger loss of competitiveness and so a reduction in long - term growth			0
that will in turn keep the deficit and debt from being reduced over the long term			0
