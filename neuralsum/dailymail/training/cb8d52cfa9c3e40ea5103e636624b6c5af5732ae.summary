by @entity0 @entity1 looked sensational at @entity2 this week in a dazzling beaded @entity4 gown			1
but it will not have escaped keen - eyed fashion observers that we have seen the dress before , on the back of @entity11 at the @entity12 in march			2
while the two women opted for different colorways ( ms @entity11 chose a champagne hue , while ms @entity17 ’s was deep red ) , the gowns were nearly identical in shape , silhouette , and construction			1
what is consistent is how well both women pull the design off – at 76 , ms @entity1 manages to hold her own against the 38 - year - old ms @entity11			0
360 view : ms @entity1 's gown has a dramatic back , which slopes down in the middle similar space : ms @entity11 's has a similar back , without netting over the sloping space ms @entity1 wore the gown with @entity46 jewelry at the @entity2 premiere of @entity48 on wednesday evening			0
ms @entity11 , 38 , wore her gown to the @entity12 in march			0
she paired her look with neutral hair and make - up and fiancé @entity52 by way of arm candy ( which , one might argue , gives her the edge )			0
the designs were both included in @entity4 ’s fall 2013 collection , which was presented in @entity59			1
on the runway : the gowns were part of mr @entity4 's fall 2013 couture collection @entity65 fans : both ms @entity11 and ms @entity1 have been spotted in mr @entity67 's gowns before , which were presented on the runway in @entity59 main definer : the only real difference between the gowns ( aside from their color ) is how ms @entity11 's hem is tutu - like and ms @entity1 's is heavily beaded but neither women is a stranger to mr @entity4 ’s designs			1
ms @entity1 wore one of his resort 2014 black lace gowns to the @entity83 gala in february this year			2
