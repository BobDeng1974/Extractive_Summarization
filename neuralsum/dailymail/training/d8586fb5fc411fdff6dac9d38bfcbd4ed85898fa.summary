@entity0 becomes new @entity2 boss as @entity3 thrash out £ 2million compensation deal with @entity2 why ? why would any manager swap @entity3 for a relegation scrap at @entity2 ? more still , why would @entity0 choose to do so ? here is a man who harbours ambition of managing @entity10 and prickles at suggestion he will not			1
he is the same man who once belittled the romantic notion of a return to @entity14			2
he was looking up , not down			2
that dismissal , however , was delivered back in august			2
it was pre-protest , pre-poison			2
@entity0 is set to be appointed as the new @entity2 manager @entity3 owner @entity19 , who is currently in @entity20 , will have the final say on @entity0 's future the @entity3 fans wanted @entity0 out after a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 @entity26 campaign four months on and , on the eve of 2015 , @entity0 ’s new year had promised the same old problems ; supporter unrest , a denial of transfer funds and the threat of star players being sold			1
for those who deal with him on an almost daily basis , last week ’s decision to voice concern over the strength of his striking options was not in keeping with the usual soundings of @entity0 the politician			1
it hinted at frustration , for never did he use a public platform to send a message to the boardroom			2
@entity0 ’s remit at @entity3 was two-fold : keep the club in the @entity26 and do not speak out against owner @entity19			1
to that end , he had been the perfect employee , evidenced by @entity19 ’s faith during the terrace uprising which followed a seven - game winless start to the campaign			1
@entity0 , though , had lost faith in his existence as black - and - white diplomat , caught in the middle of a disconnect between club and fanbase with the regime resented by supporters			1
@entity68 holds flyers for the protest website @entity71 as fans chased their manager from @entity74 @entity75 could leave in january after @entity76 and @entity77 declared an interest @entity79 fan and under pressure at @entity82			2
would work under @entity19 and gets on well with chief scout @entity83			2
4/1 @entity84 – out of work and an attractive proposition for @entity19 in that respect			0
7/2 @entity88 – would jump at the chance and possibility of bringing @entity3 favourite @entity91 with him would be popular with supporters			0
10/1 @entity94 – doing a fine job at @entity97 and is respected within @entity95			0
he would find lure of return to @entity26 hard to resist			0
16/1 @entity101 – has emerged as a popular choice among @entity3 and current @entity104 coach might fancy shot at top job			0
20/1 @entity107 - the 32 - year - old @entity108 has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis			1
15/8 the level of vitriol to which he was exposed earlier in the season may have been forgotten amid the winning run which followed , but clearly it was not forgiven			0
it hurt @entity0 , and he ’s as resilient as they come			1
when the abuse spilled over into his family life , his demeanour changed			0
he made a point of stating that a line had been crossed			0
on reflection , perhaps he crossed a line of his own that day			0
this , of course , came at a time when protest website @entity71 was dominating the news agenda and fans were being mobilised to chase the manager from @entity74			2
but @entity0 would not quit – not , at least , with his reputation having taken such a battering and his team bottom of the division			1
rather , he kept his counsel , praised the players who were underperforming and praised , too , those supporters who had chosen to stick with his team			0
he was dignified and won admirers because of it			0
the upshot was six wins on the spin and a manager of the @entity149 prize for november			2
@entity0 confronts @entity153 midfielder @entity152 during a @entity26 match in march the @entity3 manager headbutts @entity152 as fourth official @entity156 ( left ) looks on dec , 2010 : appointed @entity3 boss and enjoys 3 - 1 victory over @entity159 in first game at @entity95			1
may , 2011 : finishes his first season in 12th having lost @entity163 to @entity159 in £ 35m deal			1
may , 2012 : @entity165 and @entity166 after guiding @entity167 to fifth			0
aug , 2012 : pushes a linesman on opening day of season but later apologies and calls his behaviour ‘ ridiculous ’			0
sep , 2012 : signs new eight - year contract as reward for his success in the previous campaign			1
may , 2013 : @entity178 run ends at quarter - final stage but slump in league form sees @entity3 finish 16th			1
@entity183 , 2014 : verbally abuses @entity186 boss @entity185 , calling him a ‘ f * * * ing old c * * t ’			0
again , he later apologises			0
mar , 2014 : @entity82 ’s @entity152 and is fined £ 100,000 by the club and given seven - game touchline ban and £ 60,000 fine by @entity191			1
may , 2014 : @entity3 lose seven of final eight matches to finish in 10th and supporters call for @entity0 to be sacked			1
dec , 2014 : becomes the first manager in @entity3 ’s history to lose four consecutive @entity197 derbies			2
dec , 2014 : @entity198 after four years in charge and returns to former club @entity2			1
@entity0 might make a lot of mistakes – he ’s shoved a linesman , headbutted an opposition player and called another manager an ‘ old c * * t ’ – but he ’s not daft when it comes to his public perception			1
he did , after all , survive the fallout from the above crime sheet thanks to swift apology and self - imposed penalties			1
he knows , too , how quickly things can change			0
and , with the trials of autumn having ranked as ‘ the worst of his career ’ , he did not want to experience such ridicule again			0
before sunday ’s 3 - 2 victory over @entity221 , it was threatening to venture down that unsavoury avenue once more			2
@entity0 became the first @entity167 boss to lose four successive @entity197 derbies @entity225 ( centre ) and his @entity228 staff celebrate @entity228 's late win against @entity3 last weekend there had been four straight defeats , including a fourth consecutive loss in @entity197 derbies and the sorry surrender of their stay in the @entity237 , thrashed 4 - 0 at @entity238			1
in the wake of the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity228 on december 21 @entity0 had cut a weary figure and privately expressed fear of another revolt			1
to the backdrop of this there was a board meeting to determine the club ’s transfer strategy for january			0
with the team residing in the relative comfort of mid-table , investment in the playing squad was not deemed a priority			0
so what was ? keep things ticking over - stay in the @entity26 and do not speak out against the hierarchy , of course			2
it was a sad cycle which showed no signs of breaking under @entity19 and the new manager will have to sign up to this @entity263 mandate			1
@entity3 midfielder @entity264 ( left ) scores against @entity221 during what looks set to be @entity0 's last game in charge at @entity95 @entity0 played more than 100 games for @entity2 during a four - year spell at the south @entity272 club in short , there is no ambition			1
no ambition to be better than tenth and duck out of the cup competitions when they threaten to kill the cash cow which is top - flight football			2
he had operated within those confines for four years , all the while acting as a lightning rod should a storm brew on the terraces			0
but why @entity2 ? crucially , there is a vision which extends beyond a balance sheet			1
there is the promise of a dream , growth as opposed to endurance			0
there is control of transfers			0
there is love , admiration , respect			0
there is safety , for him and his family			0
but forget the pull of @entity2 , the push of @entity3 was the key to @entity0 ’s shock decision to quit the comfort of his eight - year contract			1
it should sound as a warning for any candidate readying a cv for delivery to @entity95 .			0

@entity0 will soon be announced as the new @entity2 manager
@entity0 will sign a four - year deal worth up to £ 2m a year
53 - year - old ready to face relegation scrap with @entity2
@entity0 sees a vision which extends beyond a balance sheet at @entity2
he played for @entity2 from 1987 until 1991
