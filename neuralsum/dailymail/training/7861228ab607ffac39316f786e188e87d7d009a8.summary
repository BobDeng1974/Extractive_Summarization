convicted double murderer @entity0 was sentenced to death by lethal injection the last words of convicted double murderer @entity0 were to prove pitifully ironic			1
as doctors inserted iv tubes into his arms in the death chamber at @entity8 in @entity9 on wednesday , @entity0 thanked @entity10 as his saviour — in his own mind at least — and made his peace with the world			1
strapped to a wheeled stretcher in an orange prison jumpsuit , he turned his head and grinned at the 20 or so witnesses watching him through a glass window from a small viewing room			2
they included his lawyers , the family of his victims and the prison chaplain , fingering his rosary as he mouthed silent prayers			2
‘ i take comfort knowing today my pain stops , and i said a prayer that , on this or any other day , you may find peace in all of your hearts , and may @entity36 forgive you all , ’ said 55 - year - old @entity0 , signally omitting to apologise for his crimes			2
‘ are those your last words ? ’ , asked the prison warden			2
‘ yes , sir , ’ he replied			0
as a controversial cocktail of lethal drugs coursed into his veins , @entity0 closed his eyes and appeared sedated			1
but whether his pain really had stopped as he expected , or whether he suffered prolonged agony was the subject of a fierce row yesterday			0
witnesses said @entity0 lay snorting and gasping for breath like a landed fish , and experts predicted his last moments may prove a watershed for the @entity55 way of execution			1
for @entity0 — convicted in 1989 of murdering his estranged girlfriend @entity57 and her father @entity58 in a shooting — took nearly two hours to die from a procedure that was supposed to kill him in ten to 15 minutes			1
as @entity64 ’s governor , @entity63 , ordered an independent investigation into why his execution took so long , @entity62 officials claimed that , although he may have taken a long time to die , there were no signs @entity0 suffered as he was ‘ deeply sedated ’ throughout			1
they insisted the execution had followed protocol , with a doctor checking @entity0 was deeply under seven times before he was pronounced dead			1
he did n’t grimace or move throughout , said officials			0
but independent witnesses begged to differ			2
@entity75 , a reporter for the @entity76 and an official media representative in the viewing room , had witnessed four previous executions			0
‘ usually it takes about ten minutes , the person goes to sleep			0
this was not that , ’ he said afterwards			0
@entity84 , right , of @entity85 , leads a group of death penalty opponents in prayer as they protest the execution of @entity0 at the state prison in @entity9 , @entity64 mr @entity75 said it started normally as @entity0 , who appeared to be smiling slightly , took a few gulps of air and then closed his eyes			1
four minutes into the process , a doctor appeared and checked @entity0 ’s pulse and then spoke to witnesses through a microphone to confirm he was sedated			1
but nine minutes after @entity0 ’s final words , witnesses say it was clear something was wrong			1
his mouth opened and , three minutes later , it opened again and his chest moved as if he had started to burp			0
then , he kept doing it — mr @entity75 said he counted this chest movement at least 640 times			0
he and @entity109 reporter @entity108 exchanged glances and agreed they did n’t think he was ever going to die			2
both compared @entity0 ’s breathing to a ‘ fish on land gulping for air ’			2
mr @entity108 described the procedure as ‘ very disturbing to watch ’ also saying that ‘ it was tough for everybody in that room ’			0
mr @entity75 said @entity0 appeared to be ‘ drowning in air ’			2
he added : ‘ the movement was like a piston : the mouth opened , the chest rose , the stomach convulsed			0
and when the doctor came in to check on his consciousness and turned on the microphone to announce that @entity0 was still sedated , we could hear the sound he was making : a snoring , sucking — similar to when a swimming - pool filter starts taking in air			2
’ witnesses said @entity0 lay gasping and snorting in his final moments ( file picture of a lethal injection chamber ) during the procedure , two of @entity0 ’s lawyers left the viewing room and phoned judges — including one in the @entity55 @entity144 — to try to get the execution stopped on the grounds that it breached the @entity55 @entity149 ’s ban on ‘ cruel and unusual punishment ’			1
at last , say witnesses , @entity0 ’s gasping became less frequent , and finally stopped as a doctor re-examined him and stated he was still sedated			1
at 3.49pm local time , an hour and 57 minutes after the procedure started , @entity154 , director of @entity64 ’s @entity155 , appeared in the window next to @entity0 ’s stretcher and announced that the execution had been completed			1
@entity0 ’s lawyer , @entity161 , said his client had ‘ gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes ’			2
his next statement was damning : ‘ the experiment failed			0
@entity64 appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror — a bungled execution			1
’ death penalty opponents said the worst thing about the prolonged death was that it was ‘ entirely predictable and avoidable ’			2
the family of @entity0 ’s victims , who had watched the execution , argued any agony he had gone through had been nothing to what he had inflicted on their relatives			1
‘ i do n’t believe he was suffering			0
it sounded to me like he was snoring , ’ said @entity180			0
‘ you do n’t know what excruciating is			0
what ’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood , seeing your sister laying there in a pool of blood			0
‘ this man deserved it			0
’ as her comments made all too clear , the case is unlikely to shake many @entity55 in their backing of the death penalty			1
supporters tend to argue no agony in the condemned ’s final moments can ever outweigh his or her awful crime			1
but @entity0 ’s protracted death is expected to have profound implications in the debate about how capital punishment is carried out			1
since @entity211 first used lethal injection for execution in 1982 , states have adopted it as a supposedly painless solution			1
however , the practice has been mired in controversy as supplies of the usual killer barbiturates have run out and executioners — often under - trained jail staff — have been forced to inject alternative drugs			2
those used in the @entity0 execution — a mix of a sedative called midazolam , that is supposed to bring on unconsciousness , and narcotic painkiller hydromorphone , that is designed to shut down breathing and stop the heart — have proved problematic before			1
controversy has focused on midazolam in two recent executions			0
in january , in @entity234 the same two drugs took more than 20 minutes to kill @entity235 , as he reportedly gasped , then started making snorting and choking sounds as he clenched his fists			2
@entity239 was used again in april by @entity241 prison chiefs putting to death killer @entity242			1
until blinds were lowered to block their view , witnesses said he writhed violently , at one point saying : ‘ man ’ , before dying after 43 minutes from a heart attack			0
it is now believed the catheter was placed incorrectly , allowing the lethal drugs to seep into @entity242 ’s tissue rather than into his veins			0
this would have meant he was only part - sedated when a final , painful heart - stopping drug was injected			0
the @entity64 state prison where the execution of @entity0 took place @entity55 ’s @entity260 has warned side effects of midazolam can include seizures , uncontrollable shaking and breathing problems			1
and @entity266 , associate professor in anaesthesia at @entity268 , compares the suffering @entity0 would have endured to the feeling of being punched in the stomach and gasping for air — in his case , for nearly two hours			1
he blamed a combination of rigid execution rules — that prevent staff responding if the procedure is going wrong — with the fact most of the executioners administering the drugs are unskilled , particularly in the difficult field of anaethesia			0
‘ with an unsafe system , bad things happen , ’ he said yesterday			0
while doctors check the state of the inmate and attach iv lines , the actual process of administering the lethal dose is left to prison staff			1
the executioners ’ biggest problem now is that many of the most effective drugs — including propofol , the sedative that contributed to @entity298 ’s death , and another , sodium thiopental — are now only made in @entity300			0
and the @entity301 , which has banned the death penalty , has told drug companies they can not export the chemicals to the @entity55 if they know they are to be used for lethal injections			1
in 2010 , campaign group @entity306 , which opposes capital punishment , discovered two @entity309 companies — archimedes pharma @entity309 and @entity312 ( based in offices above a driving school in west @entity315 ) — had unwittingly supplied @entity64 with execution drugs and business secretary @entity310 imposed an export ban			1
the drugs shortage has led some states to suspend executions and others to find back - door methods of getting the chemicals or to find new drugs companies			0
facing claims that they are using substandard , impure drugs , prison officials have refused to reveal their new suppliers			0
some states , meanwhile , are looking at older execution methods			0
@entity332 politicians support a return to the electric chair , while a @entity336 senator has demanded firing squads			0
however , experts predict that neither method is likely to meet the ban on ‘ cruel and unusual ’ punishment			0
campaign group @entity342 has compiled a list of @entity55 executions between 1982 and 2006 , which it says were ‘ botched ’			2
none took as long as that of @entity0			2
meanwhile , a major poll last year by the @entity348 found 55 per cent of @entity55 adults favour the death penalty for murder , while 37 per cent oppose it			1
this is a substantial fall on two years previously when 62 per cent said they supported it			0
with @entity55 at last wavering over capital punishment , could the lingering death of @entity0 be the final nail in its coffin ?			1
