the @entity0 are refusing to say why they are investigating last summer ’s £ 15million transfer of @entity2 international @entity3 from @entity4 to @entity5			1
the surprising probe for a deal that went through with no problems from either @entity10 club follows a complaint made to the @entity0 by , it is believed , a disgruntled third party to the deal			2
both clubs are aware the @entity0 are looking into the transaction but do not know why			2
the negotiations were amicable and handled directly by @entity18 of @entity4 and @entity5 ’s @entity19			2
@entity3 ' £ 15million move from @entity4 to @entity5 will be probed by the @entity0 chambers in conversation with his manager @entity23 ( left ) during a training session asked whether he was happy with the transfer , @entity23 on friday said : ' yes , i am very happy about his transfer			1
i made over 350 transfers since i am here			0
we have a lot of enquiries about them and we never had any problem			0
' suggestions of agents unrest would not normally be enough to warrant this type of @entity0 attention			2
@entity40 is on the books of @entity42 , whose agent @entity43 , a licensed lawyer , refused to return frequent calls because a legal colleague said it was company policy not to talk to the press			0
@entity49 ’s head of talent id and player recruitment is @entity52 , who is also @entity40 ’s stepfather			0
but there is nothing to stop an agency employing one of their client ’s family			0
@entity40 began his career at @entity4 before his move to the @entity62 last summer the issue is said by former team - mates of @entity40 to lie somewhere with @entity5 , but a club spokesman said on thursday : ‘ everything was open , cordial and above board with @entity4 throughout the @entity3 transfer			1
’ the @entity0 will not comment about any compliance department activity			2
@entity70 will have @entity72 ’s two most high - profile pundits with him in the studio when he makes his debut as axed @entity76 ’s successor for the @entity78 game between @entity79 and @entity80 on tuesday week			1
@entity70 has replaced @entity76 as football presenter on @entity72 @entity85 , after leaving his role as assistant manager at @entity84 , will be returning as an @entity72 analyst on a game - by - game basis and will have his former @entity89 team - mate @entity88 alongside			1
neither of them hold back with their often scathing opinions , which will give new presenter @entity70 a testing environment for his first game			2
@entity85 ’s demeanour will be fascinating as in the past his body language alone has shown what he thinks about daft questions from @entity76			0
@entity88 and @entity85 will team up again as pundits for @entity72 's @entity78 coverage leading football agent @entity103 has lost another of his big - name players to @entity106 , who is leaving @entity107 to set up on his own			1
following the defection of @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity5 have been informed that @entity2 ’s @entity111 will now be represented by @entity106 and @entity111 ’s father @entity70 , who also played for @entity2			1
@entity109 is all smiles during a @entity114 training session held on thursday at @entity115 @entity116 in action for @entity118 in the @entity10 against @entity119 last month @entity111 battles with @entity120 of @entity121 during the @entity10 clash last month the astonishment that has greeted @entity89 paying former manager sir @entity124 £ 2million a year for 20 days of ambassador work , first revealed by @entity126 , will be that much more with the knowledge the contract is open ended			1
this allows @entity124 to carry out such lucrative £ 100,000 - a - day engagements for as long as he wants			1
the club view is @entity124 ’s achievements at @entity136 warrant such largesse			0
sir @entity137 is being paid £ 2million a year for 20 days of ambassador work by @entity89 virgin threat derailed the @entity10 have played down the threat of @entity142 ’s complaint about the tv match selling process to broadcast regulators @entity144 — who have dismissed their attempts to derail today ’s rights bids deadline			1
but the issue was concern enough to be discussed at length at yesterday ’s club summit , with chairmen worried about where regulatory intervention is going to strike next			0
club meetings are often a foreign - owner free zone but at least @entity114 ’s @entity157 was there on thursday , while @entity160 ’s @entity159 has replaced @entity161 on the audit and remuneration committee that will select the next @entity10 chairman			0
@entity165 , @entity166 football presenter , is to become an executive director of @entity169 @entity168			0
his colleague @entity170 is president of @entity171 but hopefully @entity165 will not plug his allegiance on air as often as @entity170 bangs on about struggling @entity171			0
@entity166 presenter @entity170 is a well - known @entity171 fan as well as president at the club @entity176 , who has made clear his upset at @entity178 losing live @entity180 golf coverage , is one pundit that @entity166 are not interested in signing when they take over the rights in 2017			1
@entity176 will be 86 by then and will surely call it a day after the @entity180 in 2016 , if not at @entity184 this year			0
@entity176 will not be signed by @entity166 when they take over the rights to @entity186 from the @entity178			1

@entity0 refusing to say why they *'re* probing @entity3 ' @entity5 move
@entity70 to have @entity85 and @entity88 in first @entity72 broadcast
sir @entity124 receives £ 2m for 20 days ambassador work for @entity89
@entity176 will not be *joining* @entity166 when they show @entity186
