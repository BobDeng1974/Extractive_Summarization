it was only a small - sided game at the end of a session at @entity5 ’s @entity4 training ground , but heads were turned when teenage striker @entity7 , called over to join them , cut in from the left flank and curled the ball , side - footed , around the goalkeeper to score			1
the move echoed a former time and a former forward , as if the ghost of @entity16 was still haunting the centre ’s pitches with his trademark dribble and finish			2
@entity21 came running over to @entity7 , leaping around excitedly and shouting ‘ @entity16 , @entity16 , @entity16 , @entity16 ! ’ @entity5 's teenage striker @entity7 has been compared to club legend @entity16 @entity16 was @entity7 's idol growing up and the youngster is keen to emulate his success @entity7 ( left ) , walks to training with @entity5 team - mates @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity30 there is still a long , long way to go until the 19 - year - old gets anywhere near close to his idol @entity16 , but nicknames tend to stick around			1

” ' then the next morning he came to me and said “ @entity16			0
” i asked : ' hold on is this my new nickname ? ' that ’s how it came about and it ’s stuck since then			0
‘ now the lads just call me @entity16 or @entity16 - i ’ll take that			2
it ’s not a bad comparison to have			0
‘ he was my idol growing up			0
playing for the academy and watching @entity5 ’s first team i used to see players like @entity16 scoring every week and it really inspired me			1

‘ i ’m with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground , ’ he adds			1
‘ it ’s all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as i can			0
‘ a lot of them are international players , a lot are @entity65 players ; @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity27 , @entity30 , @entity102			1
i look up to them			0
' they ’ve made it into the @entity65 senior team			1
it ’s good to be around them and get good advice			0
’ @entity7 is a right - footed front man but likes to drop out wide to the left flank to torment full - backs			1
sound familiar ? his is quick and skilful with a sharp finish			0
most importantly , he scores goal			2
for @entity5 youth teams and @entity65 under 15 to under 20 level , bucketfuls of them			1
@entity7 in the thick of the action during @entity5 's @entity81 win over @entity119 last month the teenage striker celebrates after @entity121 converts the winning penalty in a @entity60 tie at @entity124 last season ‘ people keep telling me having a child is the best feeling , ’ he says			1
‘ i haven ’ t had that yet i ’m too young , but when i score goals - i ’d be surprised if you beat that feeling			2
’ he cites one of the game ’s greatest goal - scorers , the @entity138 ronaldo , as another idol and closer to home is aiming at the top			1

‘ he ’s the captain of the national team and that ’s something i would like to try to do			2
‘ i ’d love to be a captain - of @entity65 and @entity5			1
leading by example off the pitch and on it			0
it would be a dream			0
‘ right now , it ’s about getting in the squad first			2
you look at @entity159 , see him go to the @entity160 last summer , it shows you how fast things can change			0
‘ @entity162 is a good friend of mine , @entity162 ; young players are getting their chance			0
but now it ’s about taking it step - by - step			2
’ the together for @entity170 is a nationwide drive aimed at inspiring current and future @entity173 fans by strengthening the national side ’s relationship with local communities			0
