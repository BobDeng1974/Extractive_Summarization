seeing stripes : men along the river were kitted out in matching mustard striped blazers on the second day of @entity22 at @entity3 - on - @entity23 glossy - looking young women mingled with chaps in chinos and the brightly coloured jackets worn by rowing club members			1
ladies favoured a fashionable combination of maxi dresses teamed with oversized sunglasses , - and flat sandals seemed to be preferred to perilously high heels			1

old school : while @entity114 was renamed ' chavscot ' and the stands at @entity117 have become more rowdy , the @entity9 has stuck to its quintessential @entity119 traditions the officials who patrol the entrance of the private members club are known to refuse ' unsuitably dressed ladies ' who do not meet their strict rules			1
