regular visitor : @entity6 pictured visiting the patients and staff at @entity9 in 1972 ' we have investigated his claims today with other staff who were around at @entity9 at the time and we believe he is mistaken in his comments			1
' mr @entity0 appears to have been talking about a period in the 1980s before he started work at the hospital in 1990 and not from first - hand knowledge			1
' the assurance we have been given is that the porters did not have a key to unlock the nurses ' home			2
the building had a warden on duty 24 hours a day and we understand access was very strictly controlled to protect the staff living there			2
' the accusations against @entity106 are serious and naturally are of great concern			0
the police are continuing their national investigation and anyone with evidence should speak to them			0

' serious questions need to be asked and if after we find out what 's happened , it 's clear that people have turned a blind eye or , worse still , connived with it , then of course they 're going to have to be held to account and - if that turns out to be the case - heads will need to roll of course , ' he told @entity176 's @entity175			0
