the past nineteen years have been difficult for @entity3 the @entity2 orang - utan - she 's had a stillbirth and seen four of her infants die			2
but @entity8 staff are hoping this time her baby joy will not be marred with tragedy			1
on tuesday , the zoo 's senior primate keeper @entity12 announced @entity3 was expecting , with the baby due in late november			1
@entity3 the @entity2 orang - utan is expecting her sixth child in late november after the death of her fourth baby in 2011 , zookeepers found out @entity3 had trouble breastfeeding because of an anatomical issue			1
' the little one passed away four days ( after its birth ) and when we performed a post-mortem , we found it had passed away from an infection , but we also discovered there was no milk in its stomach , ' zoo spokeswoman @entity22 said			0
' that led to the eventual discovery that she had issues breastfeeding and why infants have not survived because they were not getting food			0
' steps have now been taken to ensure supplementary milk is deliver to new babies , and staff are hopeful her latest bub will have a better chance of surviving			2
' we 're extremely pleased @entity3 is pregnant and has the opportunity to become a mum again , something we believe she greatly deserves , ' ms @entity12 said			0
' nothing is being taken for granted and we are hoping this time around @entity51 will give us a chance to put our supplementary feeding program into practice and give her every chance of a successful outcome			0
she has had one stillborn baby and seen four of her infants die in the past nineteen years @entity3 is 31 years old and has been living at @entity8 since 1992 after coming from @entity60 ' at this point we believe @entity3 is physically , mentally and emotionally ready to try again and we ask the community for support and understanding as we head into the next part of this journey			1
' an infant was stillborn in january last year , while four other babies died soon after birth since 1995			0
ms @entity12 said @entity3 's difficulty with breastfeeding her infants may have contributed to her inability to raise them in the past			2
' since then we 've put the same training into place in the hopes that we will also be able to supplement feed future offspring and give @entity3 the opportunity to become a successful mother , ' she said			2
it was found in 2011 that @entity3 had an anatomical issue that prevented her from breastfeeding properly and now zookeepers are introducing her to a new program to supplement her breastfeeding ( left ) the technique used at @entity8 is modelled on another at @entity88 , where a @entity2 orangutan was having similar issues			1
later it was discovered the orangutan at @entity88 was @entity3 's sister , with staff hypothesising the breast feeding difficulty was genetic			1
ms @entity22 said the technique involved a fake nipple being attached to a garden hose with a syringe on the other end where supplementary milk can be passed through so the baby is able to be held in its mother 's arms while eating			0
@entity3 , 31 , has been at the zoo since 1992 , while @entity108 - the expected baby 's father - turns 19 next month and arrived at the zoo in 2007			1
the most recent estimates indicate there are as few as 6,300 wild @entity112 left			0
it 's estimated 50 are lost a week , due to the destruction of their natural habitat primarily because of the clearing of land for logging and palm oil plantations .			0

@entity8 staff announced the new arrival is expected in late november
the father of the baby is @entity108 who turns 19 next month while @entity3 is 31
it was discovered she was unable to breastfeed due to an anatomical issue
this may have contributed to why her babies were not surviving *longer*
zookeepers have started training @entity3 to get her babies more nutrients
