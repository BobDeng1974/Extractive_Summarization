employers are being urged to watch their staff for signs of domestic violence - with indicators including shifts in behaviour and changes in clothing to hide bruises			1
@entity10 ( @entity11 ) issued the warning and stressed that managers have a duty to spot people who are being abused and take steps to offer them support			1
the @entity11 guidance is part of its campaign , 16 @entity21 , which is running from november 25 to december 10 , to highlight the responsibilities that employers have to protect their workers			1
' this means you may well be involved in managing someone who has experienced or is experiencing domestic abuse , as well as those who are perpetrators of abuse			0
' research says 25 per cent of women and 16 per cent of men fall victim to some form of domestic abuse during their lives			2
as well as physical violence - this can also be verbal , emotional and financial abuse			0
more than half of those affected by domestic abuse are absent from work at least three days a month - and 56 per cent of abused women arrive late for work at least five times per month			2
a staggering two per cent of employees in the @entity61 actually lose their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence and 75 per cent of victims are targeted at work			1
this often includes harassing phone calls , text messages and emails - with abusive partners often turning up at the workplace			1
@entity11 's guidance tells companies to record any incidents that take place at work and ensure that staff do not have to work alone or in isolated areas			2
they are being encouraged to put up posters to highlight the support available for staff who disclose difficulties in their personal life			0
signs : @entity10 say managers should look out for shifts in behaviour or a change in attire that may be designed to hide bruising and employers are also advised to divert phone calls and emails from suspected abusive partners and offer employees a new phone extension number if required			1
professor @entity96 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity11 , said : ' it is unacceptable that in @entity10 and @entity101 , two women a week die as a result of domestic violence , and many more suffer physical and mental harm			1
' workplaces are a safe space for many people living in violence and are key for providing opportunities for disclosure and support into safety			0
' as it stands , companies can do more to support their employees who experience domestic abuse , train those who witness , and protect staff as a whole			2
' mr @entity96 believes companies which take steps to tackle the issue will actually benefit financially as there would be fewer unexplained absences and less staff turnover caused by violence at home			0
he adds : ' signing up to the pledge and using the toolkit not only means businesses are supporting their staff and securing safety in the workplace , but they will also save on financial loss due to absence and turnover			2
' it is a win win for businesses and we urge them to utilise this resource			0
' speaking to @entity145 he added : ' bringing discussions of domestic violence into the workplace is a crucial step in providing routes to safety for people enduring violence			1
' companies are being urged to sign the @entity156 pledge and join ' the global fight against domestic violence '			1
the @entity158 is one of the first organisations to train its staff in dealing with the issue			0
@entity163 , director of employment services at @entity165 , claimed guidance was crucial as most managers would not be confident enough to intervene			0
she said : ' it 's not about the workplace intruding into personal matters but helping to ensure the workplace does n't get in the way and can even speed up the process of recovery			0
' companies can sign the @entity176 pledge by visiting the campaign 's website .			0
