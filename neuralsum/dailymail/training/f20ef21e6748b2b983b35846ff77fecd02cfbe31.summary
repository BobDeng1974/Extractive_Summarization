ahead of @entity2 combat in @entity3 , the @entity0 blew a chance to provide @entity6 manager @entity5 with another encouraging pointer			0
six days after holding @entity10 scoreless , @entity8 were a goal in front through @entity13 , and a man to the good , against @entity15 deep into the second half of the @entity17 and seemed set fair for only their second win under @entity19			1
but then , things went horribly awry			0
after @entity22 converted a penalty in the 64th minute , @entity21 saw a penalty two minutes later saved by replacement ‘ keeper @entity25 – it was only @entity21 ’s second miss for @entity8			1
matchwinner : @entity13 hit the only goal of the game as @entity8 saw @entity6 's @entity31 foes @entity15 @entity0 : @entity32 ; @entity34 , @entity33 , @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 39 ) ; @entity38 ( @entity39 64 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 64 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 83 ) ; @entity21 ( @entity45 83 ) , @entity13 ( long 70 )			1
@entity15 : @entity48 ( @entity47 , 46 ) @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity22 , @entity54 ; @entity56 ( 87 @entity55 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 78 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 74 )			2
ref : @entity62 ( @entity63 ) referee : @entity65 ( @entity66 ) on a tempestuous night , which saw a spattering of cards , missiles thrown and post-match invasions by fans , @entity5 will have noted another incident which , unwittingly , may be of benefit to @entity6			0
after @entity76 ’s broken shin in @entity77 , @entity50 , the @entity15 central defender , faces a @entity2 ban after being sent off for violent conduct following an ugly aerial tangle with @entity13 before half - time			1
it was @entity8 who struck first through @entity13 in the 18th minute , when the @entity86 striker placed a glancing header into the bottom corner following a pin - point cross by @entity36			1
@entity13 ’s goal was almost fated as the @entity91 is under the shadow of the @entity93 , named after the founder of the @entity95 and , like @entity13 , a native of @entity97			2
it was @entity13 ’s 13th international goal and his first since september , 2012 , as he seized his recall moment			2
look out behind you : @entity15 's @entity103 fails to stop @entity13 's shot @entity8 seemed comfortable at half - time but the positioning of @entity37 at left - back for the injured @entity36 was a weakness which @entity15 seized on			1
after 64 minutes , they were level when @entity22 smashed in a penalty , awarded against ' keeper @entity32 for catching the busy @entity111 as he surged into the box			0
improbably , @entity8 were gifted a chance to restore their lead when referee @entity62 awarded a soft penalty after @entity43 tumbled under a challenge by @entity54			2
battle for possession : @entity15 wideman @entity56 controls the ball as @entity43 looks on but @entity21 , complete with trademark shuffle , was thwarted as @entity25 dived correctly to his right to push the ball away			0
@entity8 had time to regroup but apart from a late flurry , the win which manager @entity19 was seeking , eluded them			0
with one win in six games under @entity126 , @entity127 are up next for @entity8 in @entity128 on tuesday night .			0

@entity8 took the lead after @entity13 's *excellent* first - half header
@entity50 was sent off for the @entity133 for a foul on @entity13
@entity22 levelled from the spot before @entity21 missed from 12 *yards*
