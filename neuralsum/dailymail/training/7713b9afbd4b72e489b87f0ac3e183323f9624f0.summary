by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 13:15 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 17:58 est , 6 october 2013 families face having their bins collected just once a month under radical plans being considered by local authorities			2
@entity6 and black bag collections could be cut to just once every four weeks under proposals to reduce waste by @entity9			2
but its reforms could set a precedent and are being considered by other local authorities , according to the consultation document for the plans			2
outrage : @entity17 city council has caused a storm with the proposal to cut collections to one a month any such move would anger householders who have already seen a shift from weekly to fortnightly collections of their waste			1
the @entity28 - run council was immediately lambasted for its ‘ barmy ’ idea by @entity31 secretary @entity30			1
but the council has vowed to push ahead with controversial proposals to meet a target to have 70 per cent of all waste recycled by 2025			1
it will continue picking up recyclable materials , such as glass , plastics and paper , every week			1
general waste would only be collected 12 times a year , however , under one of the proposals			0
householders who put the wrong sort of rubbish into recycling bins would face fines			2
the local authority is also considering a ‘ pay as you throw ’ charge based on how much waste is collected			1
families that recycled more would pay less , while the council could impose standard fees for bin bags and wheelie bins			0
but such a charge would need a change in legislation first by the @entity61 government			2
smaller bins could also be introduced to force families to throw away less rubbish			0
the size of wheelie bins would almost halve , from a 240 litre capacity to 140 litres			0
cut backs : it is a bid to cut £ 125million in three years			1
residents may also be charged to bin their waste @entity72 : recycling will be picked up weekly in a bid to reach the council 's 2015 target of a 58 per cent increase black rubbish bags - which are still used across a third of the city - could be limited to two or three per household , to force families to cut down on waste			1
and residents could even see an annual limit to how many visits they can make to the dump or waste and recycling centre			2
residents could even be forced to put their rubbish into clear rather than black bin bags , to ‘ shame ’ them into recycling more			0
in its consultation document , @entity17 said it needs to make ‘ extremely serious ’ savings of £ 125 million over the next three years as well as meeting binding @entity97 targets for recycling of 58 per cent by 2015/16 rising to 70 per cent by 2024/25			1
' @entity99 ' : @entity30 , @entity100 , has lambasted the policy ‘ each of the following ideas is a potential scheme that @entity17 could use to meet the future recycling target of 70 per cent			1
all have been used or identified as options by other local authorities or central government to divert waste from landfill and increase reuse and recycling , ’ it said			1
@entity17 has already slashed its general waste collections to twice a month			0
mr @entity30 said : ‘ these barmy bin policies will harm the local environment by fuelling fly - tipping and back yard burning			1
‘ hard - working people will suffer from a derisory bin collection service in return for paying a fortune in council tax , which has not been frozen in @entity61			0
’ there are also fears that the piling up of nappies , sanitary and medical waste could pose a health hazard			0
but @entity9 said it would collect sanitary and food waste more frequently than its monthly general waste collections , to stop the growth in vermin			0
in its consultation document , the council said : ‘ as recycling becomes part of our daily lives , it ’s been argued that there should be little or no waste that needs to be thrown away			0
‘ with food and recycling all collected weekly , hygiene services , bulky collections and more and more materials being recycled , what is there left to throw away ? ‘ a number of local authorities that have well established fortnightly general waste collections are now considering smaller bin capacities or reducing the frequency of the general waste collections to once every three or four weeks			1
’ the document added : ‘ we do not yet know what will be implemented			0
’ a final decision on which of the options it will adopt is due next year .			0

the local authority has to cut back on £ 125million over the next three years
it is also *struggling* to increase recycling by 58 per cent to hit 2015 target
recyclable material would continue to be picked up once a week
local government secretary @entity30 *blasted* the proposal as ' barmy '
