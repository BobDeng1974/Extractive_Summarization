speaking to @entity9 , the brunette songstress said : ' i do n’t follow any strict diets , i just eat sensibly			0
' i ’m not eating @entity12 ’s or pizza every day but i do allow myself one cheat day a week , normally on a sunday			0
i have a really sweet tooth and love cupcakes , doughnuts			0
basically anything that ’s really bad for you			0
' how does she do it ! @entity4 says she loves anything that 's bad for her and has weekly cheat days where she eats doughnuts and cupcakes to burn off her sweet treats , the 30 - year - old sticks to a gruelling exercise regime			1
@entity4 says she swears by the @entity27 - the plan created by the author and multi-platform wellness entrepreneur whose clients also include @entity32 and @entity33 - to keep her body in shape			2
@entity4 explained that she uses the @entity37 dvd at home to tone up and help maintain her much - envied abs. as well as possessing a finely honed physique , @entity4 also regularly tops @entity42 polls - an honour she still ca n't get her head around			1
keeping in shape : @entity4 says she follows the @entity37 method and does the workout dvd 's at home ' i still do n’t get why people call me a beauty icon			1

citing ' stunning ' @entity54 as her icon , @entity4 maintains that she 'd never wear a full face of make - up if she had the day off , saying that she could n't think of anything worse			1
instead , she swears by a @entity59 ( being the spokesmodel for @entity61 she shows her brand loyalty by using their @entity64 5 - in - 1 @entity63 ) which she complements with a slick of mascara before heading out of the door			2
her top tip is to remove make - up at the end of the day with a face cloth to make sure every last trace is gone , and to use good night creams ( @entity4 uses @entity61 's @entity73 and @entity74 ) , because that 's when skin has time to regenerate and repair itself , she says			1
