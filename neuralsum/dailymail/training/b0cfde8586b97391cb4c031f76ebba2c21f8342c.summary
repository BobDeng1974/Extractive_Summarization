@entity48 boss @entity47 has told autumn test selection casualties @entity49 and @entity51 ‘ the door is not closed ’			2
despite boasting more than 170 caps between them , @entity10 prop @entity31 - a triple @entity64 @entity63 winner - and @entity33 fly - half @entity51 have not been chosen in a 34 - man squad for appointments with @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 next month			1
@entity47 , whose squad includes six props , said : ‘ it ’s important that he ( @entity31 ) continues to keep working			2
we have had that conversation with him			0
‘ he looks in reasonable shape physically and there are other aspects of his game , particularly around the field , that we want him to keep working on and improving			0
‘ definitely , the door is not closed for @entity49 or @entity51			0
we know what @entity49 is capable of giving us and i am sure if there is an injury or we need to look at bringing someone like @entity49 back , then we are able to do that			0
veteran @entity48 tight - head @entity49 , in action for @entity85 ( right ) , has been left out of the 34 - man squad @entity33 fly - half @entity51 has also failed to make the cut for the forthcoming @entity88 ‘ with the scrummaging rule changes , that put a lot of pressure on tighthead props			1
it probably dropped the value of tightheads by half overnight and what has become paramount is the ability of front rows to be more mobile			2
’ ospreys prop @entity100 is the solitary uncapped player , with @entity101 confirmed as captain			1
@entity104 - based players @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 also feature			1
but 33 - year - old @entity31 and 29 - year - old @entity51 — both @entity111 — find themselves on the outside looking in less than a year before the @entity114			0
@entity48 head coach @entity47 ( left ) has once again selected @entity101 as his captain			1

wales face @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 in *november*
head coach @entity47 includes uncapped @entity20 prop @entity100 in 34 - man squad
@entity122 , @entity10 *hooker* @entity123 and fly - half @entity124 also fail to make the cut
@entity104 - based players @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 all included
