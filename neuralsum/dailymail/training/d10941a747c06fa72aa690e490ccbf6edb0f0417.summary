they were the terrifying rockets that were n't unveiled until the final months of the @entity2 , yet still killed thousands			0
around 1,500 v2 rockets - the @entity5 stood for @entity6 , or @entity6 - were fired at @entity7 and the south east of @entity8 , in what was seen as @entity11 's last throw of the dice			1
as this interactive map shows , @entity7 bore the brunt of the @entity16 strikes , which began 70 years ago this week with an attack on @entity18 , in the west of the capital , and ended a year later , leaving more than 7,000 @entity21 dead			1
each strike site can be seen in more detail by zooming in and clicking on the yellow site markers			0
a work in progress , the map is still believed to be short of many strike sites , some of which can still be seen using the sat [ ellite ] tab in the top right hand corner			0
unlike its predecessor the @entity59 , this was a rocket you could n't see coming ; a space age piece of technology that laid the path for the post-war space programmes of the @entity65 and the @entity66			1
designed in @entity27 to attack @entity29 cities in retaliation for increased @entity29 bombing strikes against @entity27 cities , the @entity67 were also @entity11 's answer to his country 's disappointment that the @entity75 ( or doodlebugs ) did n't , as billed , knock @entity21 out of the war			1
launched from mobile units , the 46ft ( 14m ) tall rockets were fuelled by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 14 tons , and were the most advanced weapon used in the war until the @entity65 dropped atomic bombs on @entity86 in august 1945			1
the missile was launched vertically and could travel at more than 3,500mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away , making it the world 's first long - range combat - ballistic missile			1
a v2 rocket launch site in @entity27 - the @entity92 were launched vertically , going straight up 50 miles into the air , before flying in a trajectory of 120 miles desperate : the launch of the @entity92 against @entity29 targets was seen as @entity11 's last throw of the dice when it landed , it left a crater 60ft wide and 16ft deep , and threw up around 3,000 tonnes of rubble into the air			1
such was its speed , the noise of the rocket rushing through the air came after it landed			0
notable @entity16 strikes on @entity21 soil included the first one , which hit @entity18 , west @entity7 , on 8 september 1944 , killing three and injuring 17 , and an attack on a @entity112 store in @entity113 , south east @entity7 , in november that year which left 168 dead - @entity8 's worst death toll			1
in total , the @entity16 attacks resulted in the deaths of around 7,250 @entity21 military personnel and civilians			1
meanwhile more than 9,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in total in @entity16 attacks on the @entity124			0
that excludes the estimated 12,000 labourers and concentration camp prisoners killed while making the missiles			0
but despite the hype , and just like the @entity59 , the @entity16 did not quite live up to its propaganda			1
despite its sophisticated and pioneering guidance system , the @entity16 often missed its target			2
this situation was made worse when @entity21 leaked the misinformation that most @entity92 aimed at @entity7 were overshooting the capital by between ten and 20 miles			1
as a result , @entity27 modified the rockets ' guidance , and most subsequent rockets landed short of the city , often in underpopulated areas of @entity142			0
and the rocket was extraordinarily expensive to produce , using vast amounts of fuel alcohol when @entity27 was desperately short of it			0
at a point when the @entity27 army desperately needed cheap and effective weapons that could be manufactured en masse , production of the @entity92 required huge investment for relatively little return			0
one statistic shows that the average death toll per @entity16 dropped on @entity21 was just two people			2
compared to the hundreds of @entity29 bombers deployed in one air raid , which could leave thousands or tens of thousands dead , the @entity16 did not come up trumps			2
devastation : the worst @entity16 attack on @entity21 struck a @entity112 store in @entity113 , south east @entity7 , one afternoon in november 1944 , leaving 168 people dead designed by @entity27 engineer @entity164 , the @entity16 had four key points that marked the @entity166 out : large liquid fuel rocket engines , supersonic aerodynamics , gyroscopic guidance , and rudders in jet control			1
the automatic guidance system was perhaps the most important : this meant that once the rocket was in the air , with its destination programmed into the analogue computer , its gyroscopes could track its positioning , using the rudders to shift its course if needed			0
even today , rocket launchers still have similar engines and use gyroscopic guidance , and most are still rocket - fuelled			0
the technology that went into the @entity16 was so sophisticated , that once the war was over , @entity65 and @entity66 engineers picked the left over rockets to bits to understand how they worked			1
with the help of @entity164 , who surrendered to the @entity124 and later became a hero of the space age , the technology was harnessed to develop rockets that would go into space			2
@entity27 's solution to the expense was to get concentration camp prisoners to manufacture them			0
buried deep underground in a factory near the @entity205 concentration camp , the prisoners lived in filthy conditions			0
those who were n't executed for attempted sabotage - there were reports of prisoners hanged from cranes above the workers - died from lack of food , sleep and daylight			0
there was one positive legacy of the @entity16 rockets , though , and that was their contribution to the space race			2
given the @entity16 's ability to power 50 miles up into the air before arcing in a trajectory of 120 miles , it was effectively the world 's first space rocket			1
thus as soon as the war ended , the @entity65 and the @entity66 began a race to capture as many @entity92 as they could			2
@entity65 shipped 300 railcar - loads of @entity92 and their parts across the @entity234 , in what was known as @entity236 , and used the skill of @entity27 rocket engineers - many of whom had surrendered to the @entity124 in a bid to avoid being shot dead by the @entity240 to avoid their capture - to develop further rockets			2
they fired them in tests and studied their range and how to better it			0
meanwhile , the @entity66 used engineers to completely recreate a v2 rocket , called the @entity252 , before moving on to develop more powerful versions , the @entity250 and the @entity251			0
in october 1946 , the first photograph was taken from space using a @entity65 - fired @entity16 rocket			1
it was the first outward sign that the @entity124 had moved on from the war and were harnessing the technology of massacre to create more sophisticated rockets which would , ultimately , reach the moon			2
the first @entity16 strike ever came on the morning of 8 september 1944 , landing in @entity264 on the edge of a newly - liberated @entity266 , and killing six people			1
a few hours later that same day , a @entity16 struck @entity18 , in west @entity7 , killing three and injuring 17			2
a third strike just a few seconds later hit a field outside @entity270 , @entity271 , leaving no - one hurt or injured			0
initially @entity21 politicians tried to cover up the new threat to their people , blaming gas explosions , but this ruse was quickly seen through , and people began to refer to @entity278 sardonically as ' flying gas pipes '			0
another @entity16 attack on the capital : people gather round to help those trapped in the splintered wreckage of @entity286 market in @entity7 in march 1945 on 8 march 1945 , a @entity16 hit @entity287 in @entity7			2
many of the victims fell through the ruined building onto the railway below , and many women and children who had gone to the meat market to buy rabbits were killed , putting the final death toll for the bomb at 110			0
the worst attack on @entity21 came on 25 november 1944 , when a @entity16 hit a @entity112 department store in @entity113 , south east @entity7 , mid-afternoon , killing 168			1
the final two @entity16 attacks on @entity21 came on 27 march 1945 , and one of these attacks killed the last @entity21 civilian to be felled by a @entity16 - mrs @entity304 , 34 , who was at home in @entity306 , @entity142 .			1

first striking @entity21 in september 1944 , @entity5 for ' vengeance weapon - was @entity11 's last throw of the dice
around 1,500 ' vengeance weapons ' were fired at @entity7 and the south east , ultimately leaving around *7,250dead*
the rockets used *astonishingly* advanced technology to shoot 50 miles into air , before arcing in a 120 - mile trajectory
unlike the predecessor the @entity59 , you could not see - or hear - a @entity16 coming as it travelled faster than the speed of sound
the sophisticated technology from the @entity67 was later harnessed by the @entity65 and @entity66 to pioneer space travel
