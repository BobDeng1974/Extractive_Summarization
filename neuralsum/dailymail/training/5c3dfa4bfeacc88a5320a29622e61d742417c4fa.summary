@entity0 came off the bench to earn a dramatic draw for @entity3 on their return to the @entity6 after 10 years away			1
the 22 - year @entity8 striker slammed home late on to sent the home crowd wild and install a belief that perhaps this wo n’t be a campaign of struggle after all			0
@entity15 had threatened to burst the @entity16 ’ comeback bubble after taking two leads , first via @entity19 and then @entity20 , either side of a @entity3 goal on his debut from record £ 8m signing @entity24			1
but @entity0 ’s strike gave the hosts a point - and a 12th draw with @entity15 in 17 @entity6 meetings now , all - time			1
this was @entity3 ’s first @entity6 match after 10 long years in the wilderness			1
their last top - flight match was a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity34			1
their manager was @entity39 , their scorer was @entity40 , netting against the ‘ @entity43 ’ @entity42 team of @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity48 et al			0

goals : @entity19 20 , @entity20 45 booked : @entity86 attendance : 31 , 603 referee : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) since dropping at the end of that 2003 - 04 campaign , @entity3 have been as low as @entity103 , have changed owners to become part of a @entity109 empire - and been through 15 different managerial teams , caretakers included			1
@entity111 , in charge since late 2011 , has been transformative and his team started brightly , not bowed by the occasion			0
the first chance , albeit speculative , came as @entity71 floated a long shot from the left			0
it should n’t have troubled @entity80 but it was dipping just below the crossbar when he grabbed it shakily			0
@entity15 ’s @entity120 caught the eye at right - back with a decent understanding with @entity19 on the flank ahead of him			1
@entity19 ’s 11th - minute shot was straight at @entity61 but a sign of the danger ahead			2
the opener came in the 20th minute , impetus courtesy of @entity84 ’ low driven shot , deflected out to @entity83 , whose own shot was saved			0
the ball fell to @entity19 on the left , and with one look up he curled a precision shot to the top right - hand corner , going in net off the post			2
@entity3 were level within two minutes			2
@entity15 failed to deal with @entity71 ’ s corner and @entity24 , a summer signing from @entity139 , slammed home			1
the 28 - year - old @entity141 forward could make a huge difference to whether @entity3 sink or swim this season			2
certainly he he proved prolific one level down , scoring 23 league goals in 50 games for @entity139 after moving from @entity149 in @entity150 in january last year			0
expectations for @entity3 are high , among the ownership group at least , who are quite pleased with themselves for their work in getting their club to the @entity6			2
chairman @entity157 had a full - page photograph of himself on yesterday ’s match programme cover			0
there was another one filling page four			0
there was also a three - page interview with him where he talked about it being especially fitting for @entity3 to return to the @entity6 in 2014 as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the club ’s @entity170 parent company , @entity169			1
fantastic start : @entity15 winger @entity19 put his side ahead on 20 minutes against the @entity6 new boys roaring emotion : @entity19 celebrates scoring @entity15 's first goal of the 2014/15 @entity6 campaign @entity179 reply : @entity3 soon equalised when @entity24 ( centre ) finished past @entity80 to score landmark moment : @entity24 scored @entity3 's goal in the @entity6 since their relegation from the top flight in 2004 mad for it : @entity24 's goal caused pandemonium amongst the @entity3 fans and players inside the @entity58 @entity190 on the back : @entity15 captain @entity82 ( right ) congratulates @entity20 ( left ) after scoring @entity15 's second goal at @entity3 boom : @entity20 ( far right ) lashed home a left footed shot from the centre of the box into the corner to regain @entity15 's lead group hug : @entity83 ( left ) and @entity120 ( right ) congratulate with @entity20 ( centre ) for his blistering strike just before half - time see the build - up to @entity0 's late equaliser ... for more go to our brilliant @entity206 @entity208 miles @entity3 total 113.3 70.4 @entity70 90 12.1 7.5 @entity67 90 11.8 7.3 @entity73 90 11.6 7.2 @entity15 total 109.8 68.2 @entity20 90 12.5 7.7 @entity86 90 11.8 7.3 @entity85 90 10.9 6.8 there , in a snapshot , is the modern @entity6 : global commodity , meaning vastly different things to vastly different different			1
@entity157 ’s son , who is @entity3 ’s vice-chairman , used his own programme notes to opine : ‘ we ’re a club that can compete in this league , we have a team that has the potential to achieve great things			0
’ it would be more prudent to have survival as a first priority , although that will become apparent as the season wears on			0
a tough start continues with league games next at @entity226 , against @entity34 , at @entity227 and against @entity228			0
@entity15 took the lead just before the interval , after threatening again via @entity231 and @entity19 and being thwarted by lack of a finish from @entity89			1
@entity87 ’s scuffed shot ended up with @entity20 , who his a left - footed rising shot from 12 yards			2
@entity24 missed a header in the 54th half , wide , to spurn the host ’s best chance to that point of getting back into this but then substitute @entity242 blazed over with a comic mis - hit to put that in perspective			1
the lively @entity67 had put @entity242 through and might have elicited a red card later from @entity86 for a tough block but referee @entity99 did not hand out the second yellow necessary			0
with four minutes left , @entity0 picked up a loose ball after a @entity67 run and rushed forward to net			2
time to shine : @entity89 ( right ) made his @entity15 debut after signing for the club permanently from @entity226 in a £ 28million transfer meaty challenge : @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity86 ( right ) compete in a 50/50 tackle during their @entity6 encounter day to remember : @entity3 fans enjoyed themselves at the @entity58 on saturday after 10 years without top flight football @entity261 content with @entity3 start			1
