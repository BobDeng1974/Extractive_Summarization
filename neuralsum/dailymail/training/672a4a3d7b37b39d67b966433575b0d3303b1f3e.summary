the courtroom was cleared while the witness received medical treatment			0
court hearing : a 17 - year - old child soap star is on trial at @entity16 , pictured , for allegedly molesting a fellow student at a stage school in @entity30 over two months in 2010 the judge said he is now considering allowing the boy to give evidence via videolink as the experience appeared to be too much for him			1
the actor , who can not be named as he is underage himself , allegedly attacked the boy while they attended the same stage school in @entity30			1

jurors heard the tv star forced himself on the teenager in a stairwell and in three further attacks he molested his victim in a cellar , male changing room and the men ’s toilets			1
he now faces three counts of sexual assault and one count of rape on the boy between july and september 2010			0
opening the case at @entity16 , prosecutor @entity60 said the 17 - year - old actor admits having sexual encounters with the victim but claims it was consensual			1
he told the jury of seven men and five women the abuse started after the defendant ’s girlfriend , who was also a friend of the victim , asked him if he was gay			2
after hearing about their conversation the defendant later approached the victim , who is now 17 , and told him : ' i think i ’m bi '			1
mr @entity60 said : ' the victim took that to mean he was telling him he was bisexual			2
he then asked him to come downstairs with him but he refused			0

' during the first alleged attack at the school in july 2010 , where students at the 100 - year - old stage school were performing their end of year show , the defendant is said to have forced the victim down a staircase			1
the prosecutor continued : ' half way down he told him he had to prove [ he was bisexual ] because his girlfriend had been with a girl so he had to be with a boy			1
' the victim was not interested in returning the defendant ’s overtures ...			0
there were incidents on a weekly basis , none of which were wanted , but he was scared to stop the defendant doing what he did			0
