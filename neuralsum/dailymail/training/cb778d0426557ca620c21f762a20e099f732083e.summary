the 22 - year - old was four months into his tour with @entity53 the @entity54			2
mr @entity41 said : ' we are still dealing with the impact of losing our son and we valued his life above all else			2
if people like @entity8 are prepared to negotiate with these people , he clearly puts a low value on the lives of those who tried to help his country and his people			2
' clearly , he has little regard for the sacrifices they have made			0
' he needs to explain why he is doing this and if he can not justify it to the @entity10 and @entity1 , he certainly can not justify it to any parent who has lost their child there , or to his own people who have suffered at the hands of the @entity4			1
' relations with @entity7 have grown particularly strained over president @entity8 's refusal to sign a bilateral security deal the @entity10 is trying to block the release of the prisoners , which critics say is a concession to the @entity4 in the run - up to the country 's first presidential elections in april			1

the row will fuel concerns about the legacy that @entity1 will leave following the 13 - year conflict in @entity7 â€“ less than a month after @entity140 declared that @entity1 troops would accomplish their mission by the time their withdrawal is completed at the end of this year			1
@entity145 and former @entity147 defence spokesman @entity146 said : ' this is the unacceptable face of realpolitik			0
the allies ' precipitous departure from @entity7 is simply to mean those who have been killing our men are going to be free in the future			2

we have left him without support			0
