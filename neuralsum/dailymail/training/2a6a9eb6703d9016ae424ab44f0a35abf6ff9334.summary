cowboy surgery : @entity2 's simple procedure went horribly wrong @entity2 has made her career as an actuary – a discipline that assesses financial risk			1
so when the 47 - year - old decided to have cosmetic laser treatment in 2007 , she made sure she did some careful research			1
and it confirmed that the procedure – to get rid of thread veins around her nose – should be simple and safe			2
she chose a @entity16 clinic that appeared to be reputable and her first treatment with the yag laser was uneventful , leaving @entity2 pleased with the results			1
but her next appointment in january 2008 was not so straightforward			2
a different nurse arrived to carry out the treatment and @entity2 noticed there were a far greater number of laser ‘ shots ’ to her nose			1
‘ it felt like upwards of three times more than i ’d had during the previous appointment , ’ she says			2
‘ i think back to it now and i wonder why i did n’t tell her to stop			2
but it all happened very quickly and i trusted the clinic			0
‘ when i got home that evening , it felt as if my face was on fire			0
i slept really badly that night and i had this hot , burning sensation around my nose			0
’ @entity2 realised that something was terribly wrong			1
she went to work next day , but by lunchtime large blisters had begun to appear and she quickly returned to the clinic			0
she was told the injuries were superficial			0
but over the following weeks , the blisters turned into unsightly scabs and she had to take time off work			0
when the scabs came off , there were deep scars all around her nostrils			1
‘ i remember looking in the mirror and realising i had been scarred , ’ she says			0
‘ i just started crying			0
‘ i cried for days – i just could n’t believe this had happened to me			0
’ the clinic agreed to send her to a dermatologist , who confirmed she had suffered burns that had left her with ‘ quite severe scarring ’			1
more pain was to come when the @entity60 clinic denied responsibility , saying that it was an unfortunate skin reaction			0
in june 2009 , @entity2 finally got lawyers involved			1
the clinic admitted negligence and she received £ 15,000 compensation			0
she has had treatment to repair the scars but her emotional recovery may take far longer			1
‘ it ’s hard to get back on track			0
it all brought me so low , especially the way the clinic behaved			0
i absolutely regret having it done			0
’ burned : the damage on @entity2 's nose from the the @entity77 is calling for anyone who carries out laser treatment to have a minimum level of training and to be registered with an independent regulator			1
this would ensure that all staff know which setting the laser should be on and also how much the laser should be used in each session			1
this type of training and certification would reduce the risk of burns , such as those experienced by @entity2			1
the government shocked medics in 2010 by deregulating certain types of medical lasers that are strong enough to cause serious harm if not used properly			0
today , anyone can carry out a laser treatment – they no longer have to be a healthcare professional – and their premises are no longer inspected			1
according to @entity95 estimates , the @entity105 spends £ 2 million a year fixing botched laser operations			1
but the problem is set to get worse as more patients opt to have the quick - fix beauty treatment			2
a survey in 2008 estimated that six million women were considering laser therapy and 700,000 had already had it			2
but the @entity114 says there are at least 4,000 reports of adverse events following laser treatments every year .			2
