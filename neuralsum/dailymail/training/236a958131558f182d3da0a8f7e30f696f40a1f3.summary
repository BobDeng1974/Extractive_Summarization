ever questioned whether the moon landings were faked , whether aliens really crash landed at @entity3 or whether there was more to the @entity6 assassination than @entity7 and a lone rifle ? your view on popular conspiracy theories depends on your political affiliation , according to new findings			1
a study of registered voters in the @entity16 has found that whether you believe in @entity17 or think that global warming is a myth depends on which side of the political fence you sit			1
contentious : opinion was almost literally split in half when @entity16 voters were asked whether they though there was a bigger force than @entity7 , right , acting alone in the 1963 assassination of @entity6 , left sceptics : you 're more likely to be a @entity30 than a @entity31 if you think the @entity33 landings were faked according to the poll , carried out by the @entity35 , when it comes to some of the most famous conspiracy theories out there , @entity16 opinion is split right along party lines			1
while a staggering 37 per cent of those surveyed overall believe that global warming is a hoax , it is more likely that you are a @entity31 if you hold that view			1
for almost 60 per cent of @entity31 asked thought that the phenomenon was made up while just 11 per cent of @entity48 polled agreed			2
@entity31 are also more likely to believe that aliens crash landed at @entity3 in 1947			1
around a fifth of those surveyed in total believe that particular conspiracy theory , but just 18 per cent of @entity48 believe that a flying saucer came down in @entity55 , compared to 27 per cent of @entity31 asked			2
about 35 percent of @entity31 and @entity56 believe a secretive group of worldwide elite are trying to set up a totalitarian government known as the @entity60			2
but that number falls to just 15 per cent if you quiz a @entity30			0
party politics : naturally , more republicans believe that @entity65 president @entity65 , left , is the anti-christ than his own party 's supporters , but more democrats believe that @entity70 misled the @entity16 over @entity73 's @entity72 stock than republicans unsurprisingly , political affiliation influenced voters ' opinions on a number of conspiracy theories involving the @entity16 's two most recent leaders			1
asked if current @entity82 incumbent @entity65 is the anti-christ , a fifth of @entity31 said yes compared to a meagre six per cent of those polled who support president @entity65 's @entity48 party			0
and when it comes to the @entity89 war and whether @entity70 ex-president @entity70 misled @entity16 over @entity73 's wmds , more than 70 per cent of @entity48 say that he did and just 13 per cent of @entity31 agree			0
and questioned if former @entity89 leader @entity73 was connected with the 9/11 terrorist attacks , just over a fifth of @entity48 think he was compared to a third of @entity31			0
former @entity89 president @entity73 conspiracy ? the twin towers of the @entity96 pour smoke in @entity98 in this september 11 , 2001			0
many @entity16 believe @entity73 was involved in the attacks but when it comes to some of history 's most debated theories , opinion seems to be more divided regardless of political persuasion			1
around seven per cent of @entity16 believe that the 1969 moon landings were faked , with seven per cent of @entity48 quizzed believing that the iconic images of @entity108 taking one giant leap were mocked up , and four per cent of @entity31 holding similar views			0
just over half of those polled believe that there was a wider conspiracy involved in the 1963 assassination of president @entity6 , with both democrats and @entity31 split almost 50/50 in their views			1
and around 15 per cent of both democrats and @entity31 believe in @entity17			2
some of the more bizarre conspiracies bought by voters include the idea that sir @entity122 died in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike so that the @entity124 could carry on with their chart success - five per cent believe that is true - with nine per cent worried that the government is adding fluoride to the water deliberately for sinister means and , surprisingly , four per cent believing in lizard people			0
staggering : five per cent of @entity16 voters believe that @entity122 , left , died in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike in the @entity124			0

republicans more likely to believe that global warming is a hoax
democrats less likely to believe that aliens crash landed at @entity3
