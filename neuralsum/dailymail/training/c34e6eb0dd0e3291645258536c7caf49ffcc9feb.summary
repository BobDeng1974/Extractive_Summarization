by @entity1 reporter published : 09:03 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 09:04 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 , who was forced to give up her three - year - old son for adoption wrote to the @entity5 after its critic slammed a movie based on her life story the woman whose search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption inspired the film @entity14 has slammed a @entity16 critic who branded it ' anti-catholic and @entity18 '			1
@entity14 , which stars @entity20 and @entity21 , tells the story of @entity2 , an @entity23 woman who was forced by nuns to give up her three - year - old son @entity3 having fallen pregnant as a teenager			1
after keeping silent about her loss for 50 years she tells her story to journalist @entity28 , played by @entity21 , and the pair travel to @entity16 in an attempt to trace @entity3			1
in a scathing review in the @entity5 , @entity31 described the film as ' 90 minutes of organised hate ' , the sole purpose of which was to ' simultaneously attack @entity37 and @entity38 '			1
he brands the key characters as a ' ninny and a jerk ' and goes on to describe the film as ' a sugary slice of arsenic cake '			0
but the review prompted ms @entity2 to write to @entity31 in support of the film arguing that he had had missed the point entirely and pointing out that , despite her experience , she is a proud @entity51			1
ms @entity2 's letter , which was placed as full - page advert in the @entity54 by the film 's producer @entity55 , states the movie is supposed to be a ' testament to good things , not an attack '			1
she writes : ' your review of the movie paints its story as being a condemnation of @entity51 and conservative views			2
' it states that the relationship depicted between mr. @entity28 and myself comes across as contrived and trite , and funny for all the wrong reasons			0
forgive me for saying so , @entity31 , but you are incorrect			2
@entity20 and @entity21 in a scene from the film @entity14 , which was described in the @entity5 as ' 90 minutes of organised hate ' ' what @entity73 did with @entity28 ’s book is something extraordinary and quite real			1
@entity73 ’s take on the story of @entity28 and me searching for my long lost son , who i had n’t spoken of to a single soul in fifty years , has overwhelmingly spoken to those who have seen it in a very positive light			1
' for that i am intensely grateful , not just because people the world over have watched the movie with open hearts and embraced me for coming forward with the truth after all this time			0
' the story it tells has resonated with people not because it ’s some mockery of ideas or institutions that they ’re in disagreement with			2
@entity2 poses with @entity20 who played her in the film based on her hunt for her son @entity3 who was given up for adoption when he was three - years - old ' this is not a rally cry against the church or politics			1
in fact , despite some of the troubles that befell me as a young girl , i have always maintained a very strong hold on my faith			0
' the film is based on @entity28 's book @entity14 , which charts his and ms @entity2 's four year hunt to trace @entity3			1
he described the film , written by @entity21 and director @entity73 as ' beautifully wrought ' and ' steering a path between affecting pathos and laugh - out - loud humour '			2
the film is based on the book @entity14 , by journalist @entity28 speaking exclusively to the @entity1 earlier this year , ms @entity2 explained how she was sent off to work in a @entity51 laundry just eight weeks after giving birth			1
she described heartbreaking moment that she found out her son was being given up for adoption from one of the few nuns she considered a friend			2
she said : ' i did n’t even have a chance to give him a last cuddle			2
i saw his little face looking out of the back window of the black car that was taking him away			0
that ’s never left me , that image , in all my years			0
' i was there when they filmed that scene for the movie and it was exactly how i remembered it			0
the director @entity73 said : " what are you doing here today , are you mad ? " i did shed a tear			0
' after @entity3 was taken , oh , i cried and caused a right carry on			0
the nuns told me to shut up and to stop being stupid and that i was lucky i had my baby adopted			0
' the film has also prompted an angry response from the order of nuns , he @entity154 of @entity155 and @entity156 in @entity157 , who claim they were made to look like ‘ villains ’			0
sister @entity160 , the order ’s assistant congregational leader , said the film ‘ does not tell the whole truth , and in many ways is very misleading ’ .			0
