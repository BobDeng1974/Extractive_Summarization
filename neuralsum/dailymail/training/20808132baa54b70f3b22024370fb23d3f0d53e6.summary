earlier this week , charts revealed a number of rappers , including the group @entity3 , may have a wider vocabulary than @entity5 did - and now researchers have taken this lyrical analysis a step further			1
as part of the @entity11 in @entity13 project , researchers studied the prevalence of different drugs in rap lyrics to plot how the popularity of substances have changed since the late 1980s			2
it found that weed and cocaine have consistently been prevalent in rap music , alcohol is on the decline and pharmaceutical drugs have seen a dramatic rise in recent years			1
as part of the @entity11 in @entity13 project , researchers studied the prevalence of different drugs in rap lyrics to plot how the popularity of substances has changed			2
this graph tracks the historical references of weed in hip - hop music			2
it peaked in the early 1990s and has remained consistently high ever since			0
the researchers found weed is still the most commonly referenced drug in rap music today the top five rappers who made the most references to weed , cocaine , pharmaceutical drugs , codeine and @entity42 the charts also reveal how changes in political policy and society can directly influence rap lyrics			1
the researchers began by gathering data from the @entity51 site – the same one used in @entity53 ’s vocabulary study			1
in the context of the charts , prevalence of a drug was based on the total number of rap songs referencing that drug in a year , divided by the total number of songs released annually			1
the researchers excluded certain substances and slang phrases to prevent the results from becoming skewed			0
for example , heroin was left out because it is sometimes referred to as ‘ boy ’ - a common word used in other contexts			0
the stacked area graphs highlight the prevalence of different phrases , and therefore drug references , by nature of their vertical height			0
historically , weed and cocaine have been the most prevalent drugs in rap lyrics , according to the research			2
@entity83 equally came out on top as the most - mentioned substance in rap music today			1
the analysis revealed weed began its reign in the early 1990s with a steep increase from previous years , and has remained consistently high ever since			0
this was reflected in society			0
in 1977 , 11 states decriminalised marijuana possession , but during the 1980s political policies about illicit drugs and the prosecution of non-violent drug offenses increased			0
during the 1992 presidential election , @entity99 then voiced his opinion favouring treatment over incarceration			0
@entity104 was already popular in rap music during the late 1980s , the date the researchers began their analysis , but its prevalence dipped in the early 1990s			1
by 2004 , prevalence was the highest it had ever been but towards the end of the decade its popularity fell again in line with a rising popularity of pharmaceutical drugs			1
a drop in cocaine references were also mirrored with a drop in alcohol - related lyrics pharmaceutical drugs were hardly mentioned in rap songs during the 1990s but over the past 20 years - and in particular since 2007 - their prevelance has soared			1
@entity123 and oxy were the main pharmaceutical drugs mentioned in rap music prior to the mid- 1990s			1
since then , other prescription medications have become notorious for appearing in hip - hop songs including @entity128 and @entity129 example lyrics that include drug references include @entity132 's , pictured left , 2009 song @entity134 , in which he raps ' @entity42 got you feeling like a champion			1
' while @entity139 , previously known as @entity139 , pictured right , has consistently rapped about weed in songs including his ' @entity143 ' collaboration with @entity144 in 2011 , and references to ' real sticky icky ' in still d.r.e with dr @entity146 in 1999 and between 1992 and 2006 , official figures suggest the price of marijuana fell by 16 per cent while its potency shot up 53 per cent and this may have influenced the rise in related lyrics			1
@entity104 was already popular in rap music during the late 1980s , the date the researchers began their analysis , but its prevalence dipped slightly in the early 1990s			1
from 1996 to 2009 , cocaine then became the drug of choice for rap lyrics , and only marijuana proved more popular before and after this time period			2
the charts also reveal that the year 2000 marked the beginning of a steep rise in codeine syrup 's inclusion in rap songs			1
the prescription - strength cough syrup is also known as purple drank			0
despite a brief dip in the mention of the drug around 2008 , recent lyrics have shown an increased use of the syrup mixed with alcohol , soda , juice , or , as in the case of ' sizzurp , ' @entity183			2
its sale and use has reportedly led to an escalation in crime and pharmacy robberies , added the researchers according to the study , rapper @entity191 , pictured left , made the most references to cocaine , @entity42 , and codeine , including the i 'm @entity198 lyric ' yeah dough fiend , drink mean , like codeine			0
' @entity201 , pictured right , included the most references to the pharmaceutical drugs			2
for example , in i 'm having a relapse track he raps ' pop a @entity129 , relax ' alcohol 's prevelance in rap lyrics has been the most changeable , pictured			0
it 's consistently been popular , but particular brands have fallen in and out of favour			0
rappers still have a preference for @entity217 , also known as @entity217 , and its popularity began in the mid 1990s			0
while the prevalence of @entity220 and @entity221 , which peaked in the mid and late 2000s respectively , has begun to taper off			0

in addition , it seems that cocaine ’s popularity started to fall around the time codeine syrup became more popular			1
after experiencing a brief dip in the early 1990s , there was a significant shift in the prevalence of alcohol brand mentions in hip hop			0
