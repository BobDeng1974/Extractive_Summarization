by @entity1 reporter published : 04:49 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 05:24 est , 29 september 2013 appalled : @entity3 writer @entity2 says hit @entity5 shows like @entity6 are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women a leading @entity3 crime writer says @entity5 authors are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women , in a stinging criticism of ' gratuitous ' hit shows like @entity16 and @entity6			1
@entity2 , creator of the @entity18 and @entity19 novels , has expressed concern that prominent @entity22 writers are trying to outdo each other when it comes to portraying gruesome crimes against females			1
she believes there is a trend that has entered ever more morbid and misogynistic territory following the worldwide success of @entity32 's millennium trilogy			2
from the opening episode of the tv drama @entity16 , when the mutilated body of a female @entity39 politician is discovered , to the first season of @entity6 , which starts with a girl running for her life through a wood , and the serial killer targeting women in @entity47 's @entity46 , violence against females is prevalent in @entity5 noir			1
@entity55 , speaking to the @entity49 from an event in @entity51 where she was discussing her latest @entity19 novel , @entity54 , said that , although there had always been violence in crime fiction , it was now ' much more embedded '			1
she said : ' i especially do n't like the graphic violence against women and children , often depicted in novels such as @entity66 and others			1
i 'm not sure if it 's being done just to entertain , or whether it really is necessary for the characters involved			2
' in @entity66 , a character is anally raped			2
a teenage @entity32 witnessed three of his friends gang - raping a young girl , which he said inspired the theme of sexual violence against women in his work			1
@entity32 's original title for the first part of his millennium trilogy translates as ' @entity66 '			0
gruesome : @entity16 , starring @entity82 and @entity83 , has been a massive tv success but @entity2 says the level of violence is ' gratuitous ' graphic : another popular show to come in for criticism from @entity2 is the killing , starring @entity91 and @entity92 , pictured violent films like @entity66 are in contrast to the more gentle works of @entity55 cleeves said she had gone off @entity99 author @entity47 's work too			1
' i preferred his earlier books , which were much less violent			0
a lot of it is subjective , of course			0
my work is less violent because we tend to write what we want to read … and i 'm not that interested in gruesome books			0
any violence , to fit in well with a crime novel , has to have compassion			2
' @entity32 's @entity112 has been a worldwide smash hit various academic studies have investigated the much debated issue of violence against women in the genre , questioning whether it is necessary , or simply for entertainment value			1
@entity122 crime writer @entity121 has argued this form of violence reflects sexism in society			2
@entity2 has had huge success with her @entity18 and @entity19 novels			0
@entity129 recently finished screening the third series of @entity18 , with @entity131 in the title role , and has commissioned a fourth , now being filmed in the north - east and due to be broadcast next year			0
she says she is aware families are being entertained by her shows on a murder theme but says she tries not to make her work ' gratuitous '			0
a successful pilot of @entity19 on @entity138 earlier this year , with @entity139 as detective @entity140 , has led to a six - part series being filmed now , also going to air next year			0
cleeves praised a number of @entity3 and foreign crime authors , notably @entity39 writer @entity145 and @entity147 author @entity146 , both winners of the @entity149 , given by the @entity150 for the best translated crime novel of the year .			0
