@entity0 , 53 , siphoned off his parents ' cash and wound up a number of trusts by forging his brother and mother 's signatures a man has been jailed for four years after cheating his brother out of a £ 1.5million inheritance because he was fed up with him being the ‘ favourite ’ son			1
@entity0 , 53 , resented his brother @entity9 moving to @entity12 and @entity13 – leaving him to care for their elderly mother – and siphoned off cash from their parents ’ estate			1
@entity0 wound up a number of trusts and settlements by forging the signatures of his mother @entity23 and 55 - year - old brother			1
he also cashed in two life insurance policies , worth just under £ 100,000 together			0
the family estate should have been split equally between the brothers , but @entity0 transferred cash into a joint account with his mother , before moving it into a sole account in his name			1
the cash was then handed to his former partners and used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company			0
but the ploy unfolded when mrs @entity38 died aged 81 and @entity9 discovered his brother ’s deception during a conversation with lawyers			1
following a three - week trial @entity0 was found guilty of five counts of fraud			2
handing him four years and four months behind bars , recorder @entity46 described him as ‘ ruthless ’			0
‘ this is a case which involves an unusual blend of both tragedy and seriousness , and in light of … the seriousness of your dishonesty and scale of the sums involved , it seems to me that i have no choice but to adopt a lengthy period of custody			0
‘ on one level this case could be viewed simply as a breach of trust towards your mother , carried out in a systematic and methodical manner			0
throughout this period your mother and brother trusted you to look after her			2
‘ you did this in one respect but in terms of her finances you failed her dishonestly			0
you failed her in … your judgment and you have been convicted of dishonesty and abuse , and that word abuse can be used in its full sense of your role			0
’ @entity86 heard that @entity0 ’s father @entity87 set up a number of trusts in 2002			1
the brothers were told proceeds of the estate ‘ should be divided equally between them ’ if both parents died			0
@entity0 , of @entity95 , @entity96 , was given prime responsibility for the trusts ’ administration following his father ’s death in august 2004			2
he wound up one settlement and gave half the proceeds – £ 109,000 – to his brother , convincing him the rest was still in the trusts			1
@entity0 was found guilty of five counts of fraud following a three week trial at @entity86 ( pictured ) but @entity0 began to look into other accounts , faking his mother ’s signature to access the money and to close a settlement			1
it was only when mrs @entity38 died in november 2010 and emails were sent between a solicitor and @entity9 regarding family trusts , that he discovered what his brother had done			2
in a victim impact statement , he said he did not bring the case to have his brother punished , but to bring to light what had happened			0
he added that his parents had intended the money to go towards their grandchildren			0
@entity126 , prosecuting , told the trial : ‘ there is some talk of @entity9 always being the favourite son … but what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that [ @entity0 ] practised deceit , in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to … in excess of £ 1.5million			1

he wound up trusts and settlements by forging his mother 's signature
£ 1.5million was taken from what should have been brother 's inheritance
but ploy unfolded when their mother died and lawyers revealed deception
