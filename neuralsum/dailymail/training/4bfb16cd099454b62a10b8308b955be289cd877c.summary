by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 10:26 est , 13 march 2014 a former member of president @entity4 's @entity3 has revealed that he now expects to make $ 4million in his role as an executive at @entity7			1
@entity8 left his post as the @entity11 director in july 2010 and got a major salary boost when he joined the bank in 2011			2
now his ex-wife is fighting for a renegotiated child support package and the court documents showed how dramatically his pay has increased since joining the private sector			0
current wife : @entity8 , seen here with then - fiancee @entity21 at a @entity22 state dinner in may 2010 , is fighting with his first wife ( not pictured ) over child support payments for his two oldest children last year , he reportedly made $ 3.1milllion but he apparently expects to make $ 4million this year			1
mr @entity8 was married to @entity26 , whose maiden name @entity28 but has since adopted her mother 's name , until 2006 and the couple had two children together			2
at the time , they agreed that he would fund a $ 400,000 trust that would cover school tuition for their children and other unidentified major expenses			1
it is not clear if they had a separate alimony agreement but ms @entity28 has not been reliant on him for money as the @entity44 reports that she is a consultant for @entity45 and makes $ 350,000 on her own			0
the children 's fund has been depleted over the past eight years between tuition at @entity49 which ranges from $ 32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $ 36,890 for seniors in high school			0
renegotiating : @entity53 ( left ) , who now goes by her mother 's maiden name of @entity26 , was married to @entity8 from 1997 to 2006 and they have two children together			1
she is fighting for more child support together : @entity8 's children from his first marriage - @entity61 ( left ) and @entity63 ( right ) - live and go to school in @entity65 while he and @entity21 and their son @entity66 ( center ) live in @entity68 while he works for @entity7 and she for @entity69 tuition : @entity8 has offered to pay @entity49 tuition - which ranges from $ 32,100 for pre-kindergarten to $ 36,890 for seniors in high school - for this two children from his first marriage but his ex wants a monthly stipend @entity8 , who was president @entity4 's youngest @entity3 member and is now 45 , has offered to replenish the fund and pay the tuition bills directly so that they would not drain the fund			1
ms @entity81 has a different plan , however , and wants him to pay $ 22,000 - per - month			0
that plan would amount to him paying $ 264,000 - per - year as opposed to one lump fee for the trust			0
split : questions linger about when exactly @entity8 and @entity87 ( pictured in 2005 ) broke up , and whether or not he knew she was pregnant with their daughter @entity89 at the time his lawyers have nixed her proposal , slamming it as ' backdoor alimony cloaked as child support '			2
@entity8 fought the court to try to have the financial battle sealed but the @entity65 court ruled that it would be ‘ both inappropriate and untenable ’ to keep @entity8 ’s earnings private			0
the salary increase will also mark a blow for @entity102 as @entity8 was one in a string of @entity4 administration heads who left for more lucrative jobs on @entity106			2
this has been the biggest child support battle yet for the economist but it is not the first time that his personal life has played out on a public stage			0
after he and ms @entity81 split in 2006 , he was momentarily one of @entity65 's most eligible bachelors			0
the 6 foot 2 inch @entity116 native had something of a cult following with fans who launched a website called @entity121			0
his public profile became more about his personal life than public policy in 2010 when he got engaged to @entity126 anchor @entity125 weeks after his ex-girlfriend gave birth to his child			1
@entity8 split from his shipping magnate heiress girlfriend @entity87 in the spring of 2009 when she was three months pregnant			1
in november of that year , ms @entity87 gave birth to their daughter @entity133 , and less than six weeks later , ms @entity21 announced on air that she was engaged to @entity8			1
according to the @entity136 , friends of ms @entity87 began talking to the press , alleging that he had promised to marry her after she became pregnant but then left her after meeting ms @entity21			2
in the joint statement that @entity8 and @entity87 issued in january to deal with the gathering storm , they allude to the fact that they split months before the birth but never said exactly when			1
official : @entity143 , pictured with @entity8 at the @entity144 in may 2010 , announced their engagement on air and showed her ring which friends of @entity87 took as an insult newest addition : @entity8 and @entity21 live in @entity68 ( pictured during a visit to the @entity152 ) with their son @entity66 though he also has a residence in @entity65 ' we were in a committed relationship until the spring of 2009			1
in november , @entity87 gave birth to a beautiful baby girl			2
although we are no longer together , we are both thrilled she is happy and healthy , ' the statement read			0
some reports allege that @entity8 and ms @entity21 first met at the @entity144 which was held in may 2009			0
his lovelife was clearly a poorly kept secret at the time , as president @entity4 even made a joke at his expense the following year , saying that a new reality show would be launched called ' @entity168 @entity8 '			1
@entity8 and ms @entity169 have since added to his brood when their son @entity171 was born in april 2012 .			0

@entity8 has revealed that he expects to make $ 4million this year
he was the head of the @entity11 for president @entity4 before leaving for a more executive job at @entity7
he left the administration just months after his private life became an issue
the ' eligible bachelor ' was dating shipping heiress @entity87 before meeting @entity69 anchor @entity21
months after he and @entity87 split , she gave birth to his daughter @entity186 - and just six weeks later @entity143 announced they were engaged
now he is having issues with his ex wife @entity26 who he *divorced* in 2006 after having two children
she wants monthly payments of $ 22,000 because the $ 400,000 trust he agreed to when they split has run *dry*
