@entity2 series @entity0 is the tv phenomenon of the year			1
and while @entity4 and her @entity6 girls embraced @entity7 as an extra character in their show , detectives @entity14 and @entity15 have an imposing - if slightly dangerous - version of @entity11 as their backdrop			1
the southern @entity17 state is drenched in drama and history , and as the thrilling tv manhunt reveals a darker side to the sleepy @entity23 stretch travel fans are treated to a display of fascinating nature and architecture			1
the sweeping landscape shots including bayou banks , lush fields and sprawling trees play a huge part in adding to the show 's cinematic style			0
so taking inspiration from the hot show and its brooding stars we look at five ways to enjoy @entity11 ( that do n't involve serial killers , corduroy suits or @entity43 squads )			1
there 's also a lot of psychobabble from @entity14 that we ca n't really understand but the scenery is so pretty that we do n't mind			0
in their drives of a @entity70 book the @entity67 recommends taking a trip along the @entity72 , a 70mile loop that starts and ends in @entity74 and is the perfect way to learn about the state 's @entity57 culture , derived from @entity79 settlers and african slaves			0
the ' @entity81 : @entity11 app ' is also a brilliant way for foodies to explore the area by car , offering information on , and directions to , the best local restaurants from five - star eateries to mom - and - pop diners			1
grand : old plantations are dotted throughout the countryside and many are now serving as tourist sites take a cocktail tour : booze and bars feature heavily in the series and while we definitely would n't condone turning to the bottle with quite as much enthusiasm as detective @entity14 there 's no denying that the people of @entity11 know how to enjoy a drink			1
@entity107 is king when it comes to cocktails , holding the honour of inventing the drink in the form of the @entity114 , when local chemists mixed cognac with absinthe and bitters as a medicinal tonic			0
the @entity121 company offers a cocktail - based walking tour of the city 's pretty @entity123 that acts as a history tour with a twist , including tipples such as the @entity128 , the @entity129 and the @entity130			0
old booze in @entity107 : the @entity114 , the world 's first cocktail , was invented in the @entity11 city get woo 'd with voodoo : dark magic is an underlying theme of the show , taking the form of twig people , cult fiction and a exploration of @entity143			1
@entity11 , and more specifically @entity107 , is the home of @entity144 in the @entity17 and ' psychics ' and tarot readers line the streets of the city ready to swap your money for their insight			2
a more comprehensive way of learning about the @entity155 magic might be a visit to the quirky @entity157 , whose owner 's great - great - grandmother claimed to have been brought up with a @entity161 ( and if you ca n't make it all the way to @entity11 the museum offers handy telephone readings for just $ 40 )			2
@entity166 : voodoo , blues and booze rule in the @entity123 the agents spend most of their time on location in the fields and swamps of the ' @entity176 ' state spooky : abandoned houses and churches on the banks of the bayou feature throughout paddle the bayou : the slow - moving water of @entity11 is the perfect way to explore the area 's distinctive landscape and some of the waterways of the state parks feature protected wildlife areas that feature families of fierce - looking alligators			1
if rowing or paddling around reptiles is n't your idea of a good holiday then there are yacht charters galore , or a trip on one of the original @entity202 mud steamers is a more civilized way to watch @entity11 go by			2
request an official travel guide from the @entity205 at @entity206 which features information on all of these options			0
wild waterways : huge trees and alligator - infested rivers release your inner nature - lover at @entity214 : in the show the remote @entity214 is the setting for a rather terrifying cliff - hanger , in real life the island is just as remote , buried at the very @entity23 tip of the state , but you do n't need to visit @entity214 to see the birds in their natural habitat as they are all over the place			0
not a bird fan ? why not go and see the ' other ' @entity176 on the basketball court at @entity228 in @entity107 ( see @entity229 for game details )			0
