people quoted in the book report ' bruising experiences ' with @entity1 rampant feuding , squabbling and backstabbing among prince @entity0 ’s courtiers has seen the heir ’s household nicknamed @entity9			1
biographer @entity12 said a ‘ former householder ’ made the comparison to ‘ the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by @entity15 in her fictionalised account of the rise of @entity18 under @entity19 ’			1
the author claims that @entity22 has ‘ glaring systemic weaknesses ’ and is riven by intense rivalries between several staff factions			0
‘ it is hard to know who can be trusted , and criticism can send the prince into despair , ’ she adds			2
on one occasion , the divisions reportedly led to the collapse of a multi-million - pound deal to base all of @entity0 ’s charities in one site			1
more than £ 100,000 was said to have been wasted on the deal			0
one businessman who helped the household to organise an event said : ‘ no company would be expected to run along these lines			2
there was a lot of backstabbing			0
’ an insider added : ‘ there are certain people who , because they ’re pretty cunning in the dark arts but loyal and able and are good in their timing , also involve themselves in the dark arts of undermining other people			0
i think [ the prince ] has n’t always been best served by this			0
’ others quoted in the book recount ‘ bruising experiences ’ with @entity1 , @entity0 ’s former personal assistant who was rumoured to squeeze the prince ’s toothpaste for him			1
