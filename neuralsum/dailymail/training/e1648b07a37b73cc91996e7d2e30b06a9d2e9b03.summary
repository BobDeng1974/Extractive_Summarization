slow down ! @entity0 has added two minutes to every hour of flight in a bid to save on fuel costs slowing down @entity0 planes below 600mph adds two minutes to the average hour of flying , but has reduced the company 's fuel bill by 15 per cent - and executives insist it will have no effect on flight safety			1
the no - frills airline , famous as much for its revenue - boosting hidden charges as its publicity stunts , will also offer businesses the chance to advertise on its fleet of 303 @entity39			0
firms will be able to place their adverts for 12 months at a time on the plane ’s inner and outer winglets , or on its front and rear fuselage , where plane - spotters and airport users can see them			0

@entity0 blamed a six per cent surge in fuel costs and the early @entity56 for a 21 per cent decline in first - quarter profit to £ 67million before tax			1
the fall , which @entity0 said was in line with its guidance to the market , came despite a three per cent increase in passenger numbers to 23.2million and a five per cent rise in revenue to £ 1.16billion			1

@entity0 has been locked in a dispute with the @entity122 , which wants it to sell off a 29.8 per cent stake in compatriot airline @entity124			1
