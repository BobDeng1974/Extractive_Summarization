the third tier has housed a clutch of former @entity3 sides in recent seasons including a couple of @entity8 football 's heavyweights , with @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and wednesday , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 all dipping their toes in @entity17 waters			1
only three of those - @entity14 , @entity13 and , last season , @entity10 - were promoted back to the @entity21 at the first time of asking , with @entity9 spending three years in the third tier			2
this season , @entity23 go one better , or worse , than @entity9 as they embark on their fourth successive season in @entity17 , and it is a stay they will be quadruply determined to end			1
rebuilding : @entity27 has overhauled the @entity23 squad since taking over in late october returning to @entity17 after just one season in the @entity21 are @entity30 and @entity31 , while @entity33 's eight - year stay in the second tier came to an end in may			1
coming up from @entity36 are three familiar faces to this level in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , and one not so familiar one in @entity42 , who start only their third season in the @entity45			1
intriguingly , no club in the division has changed their manager this summer - though that statistic is bound not to last very long once the new season kicks off			1
here , @entity51 previews the @entity17 season ahead of the opening fixtures ... the favourites if @entity23 replicate the form they showed in the second half of the last campaign they will surely be in the automatic promotion places			1
@entity27 has reshaped the @entity61 squad to give it a younger feel and despite losing star man @entity63 to @entity64 this summer they have clearly improved on the whole			0
case for the defence : @entity63 only turned 21 in march but made 166 appearances for the @entity61 similarly , @entity70 have lost a key player in winger @entity72 to @entity73 but look a better unit			2
@entity70 just missed out on automatic promotion last season and look well set for another push for the top two after signing several players proven at @entity80			1
the 85 points fifth - placed @entity82 had racked up last season would have been enough to win @entity17 the campaign before			1
while he has not made any eye - catching signings , manager @entity84 has managed to cling on to his key men and @entity82 are therefore again likely to challenge for automatic			0
@entity88 flirted with a second successive relegation last season but had a revival once @entity91 took charge in december			0
they have also strengthened and if they can keep hold of their strikeforce of @entity97 and 23 - goal @entity98 they will be in the automatic promotion hunt			0
top of the charts : @entity98 scored more goals than anyone else in @entity17 last season @entity30 are lacking strength in depth at the moment but their starting @entity110 is as good as any at this level and with a few additions they will be ready to challenge for an immediate and automatic return to the @entity21			1
dark horses the relegated duo of @entity33 and @entity31 have rebuilt sufficiently over the summer to render them both promotion contenders but neither have the personnel nor the resources to have aspirations of dominating the division as @entity10 did last season			1
they will both , nonetheless , be targeting promotion , but may have to settle for the play - off route			0
@entity125 flew out of the blocks last season before falling away badly and eventually being beaten in the play - off semi-finals by @entity70			2
automatic promotion looks a bridge too far again for @entity131 's side but if they can reinvest some of the £ 5m paid by @entity134 for star striker @entity135 they should be assured another top - six finish			0
@entity135 of all right : @entity125 striker @entity135 ( middle ) has moved to @entity134 for £ 5m @entity138 finished in the top six in 2011 and 2012 but have missed out in the last two seasons after selling many of their prizes assets			0
but @entity144 has been able to improve his squad over the summer for the first time in years and they look in a position to challenge again			0
@entity42 's financial clout has seen them improve what was already a very strong squad after their @entity36 play - off final win over @entity153 and a third promotion in four years is not entirely out of the question			2
@entity157 , free from the 10 - point deduction that hampered them last season , will have one eye on the top six despite losing top scorer @entity162 to @entity163			0
relegation battle @entity17 is the most treacherous division in the @entity45 by virtue of the fact that four go down rather than three in the championship and two in @entity36			2
that being said , @entity170 , who survived on the final day of last season , would have been relegated in @entity36 with their 50 - point tally			2
the @entity173 won six of their last nine games under @entity176 last season and should survive more comfortably this time around with a mix of youth and experience added to the squad			0
great escape : @entity176 ( left ) with his new player - coach and former @entity184 international @entity183 conversely , fellow strugglers from last season @entity186 look to have gone backwards over the summer and their fans will be fearing the drop unless they can unearth another gem or two from their academy - which history proves is not entirely out of the question			0
@entity40 and @entity41 - promoted automatically from @entity36 in may - have both lost vital goals with @entity195 and @entity196 moving to @entity33 and @entity73 respectively			1
they could be joined in a relegation fight with @entity36 champions @entity39 , who have been frustrated in the transfer market so far			0
elsewhere , @entity201 and @entity202 have been hit hard by summer departures and look set for a relegation battle along with perennial strugglers @entity205 and @entity206			0
@entity23 13/8 , @entity82 12/5 , @entity88 5/2 , @entity125 11/4 , @entity70 10/3 , @entity138 9/2 , @entity33 5/1 , @entity30 11/2 , @entity31 6/1 , @entity157 7/1 , @entity42 8/1 , @entity207 9/1 , @entity39 9/1 , @entity40 9/1 , @entity208 10/1 , @entity201 10/1 , @entity206 12/1 , @entity202 14/1 , @entity209 14/1 , @entity170 14/1 , @entity41 14/1 , @entity205 22/1 , @entity210 22/1 , @entity186 28/1			1

@entity17 season kicks off with 12 fixtures on *saturday* , *august* 9
@entity30 , @entity33 and @entity31 were all relegated from the championship
promoted were @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42
