by @entity0 caught in a deadly firefight , a combat doctor stumbles towards a wounded soldier soaked in blood			0
with only a charred metal panel as his operating table , the medic knows he has 90 seconds to stop the bleeding before the soldier dies			0
with this in mind , a veteran combat surgeon has developed the first inflatable tourniquet that controls circulation and stems blood loss at the waist , caused by bomb blasts and other injuries - and it can be deployed in just 25 seconds			1
based on his experiences , dr @entity20 teamed up with @entity31 design firm @entity21 to develop a tourniquet specifically designed to save lives in battle			1
tourniquets are medical devices used for the temporary control of circulation , and on the battlefield , are vital to preventing blood loss			2
but this particular tourniquet is different			0
it is the first field dressing that can be used at the waist to stabilise the pelvis and stop bleeding			2
the only field treatment previously available was a rigid armature - and - clamp contraption which was slow , clumsy and lacked the benefit of pelvic stabilisation ( right )			0
the new system ( left ) is far simpler to use simple instructions are printed on the device in the event that the medic is also suffering trauma from injury the ‘ @entity59 ’ is placed at or near the injury site , strapped on and pumped up until the bleeding stops			1
the nylon surface of the strap hides pneumatic air balls that are inflated to stop bleeding			1
a shut - off valve is included to prevent medics from over-inflating the device			2
a buckle provides clear visual and sound cues to make sure the the medic knows when it is properly set			0
simple instructions are also printed on the device in the event that the medic is also suffering trauma from injury			2
‘ research continues to show that high - on - the - thigh and groin - level injuries sustained in these blasts are the leading preventable cause of death in @entity81 , combat situations , ’ @entity75 wrote on its website			0
‘ the only field treatment previously available was a rigid armature - and - clamp contraption which was slow , clumsy and lacked the benefit of pelvic stabilisation			0
’ dr @entity20 gave @entity75 complete design freedom with his only caveat being that it should be ‘ brain dead and bomb proof			1
’ according to @entity93 , @entity21 designers got rid of their sketchpads and instead opted to create a prototype by crawling on the floor of their studio and dodging imaginary mortar shells			2

a shut off valve is included to prevent medics from over-inflating the device what they came up with was something known as the ‘ @entity59 ’ which weighs around a pound ( 0.45kg ) and can be deployed in under 25 seconds			0

over 1,200 systems have now been shipped to active battle zones and just a month after it was sent into the field , this new version of a tourniquet saved a life in @entity131 .			1
