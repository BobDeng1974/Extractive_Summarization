@entity0 today compared himself to action hero @entity1 in his mission to overhaul @entity4 's relationship with @entity5			1
the prime minister said a @entity8 victory in the @entity9 would give him a ' very powerful mandate ' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible			2
it came after @entity14 , the @entity15 president of the @entity16 which represents @entity18 leaders , said rewriting the @entity18 treaties to curb migration would be ' close to @entity21 ' for mr @entity0			1
but the @entity6 told a press conference in @entity23 : ' @entity1 normally prevails in the end			1
he 's a little bit smaller than me , but i hope to be just as effective			2
' @entity0 , pictured in @entity23 today , has compared himself to action hero @entity1 in his bid to overhaul @entity4 's relationship with @entity5 mr @entity0 urged voters to the election as an ' opportunity to make sure the problems that bedevil @entity4 's relationship with the @entity18 are dealt with ' , he said			1
he said : ' the moment of truth is fast approaching , ' he said			0
' one of two people will represent @entity4 in @entity5 after the election			2
it 's either me or @entity40			2
' if you send me back here as prime minister on 8 may , i have a very clear plan			0
i want to sit at that negotiating table with a mandate from the @entity48 people to reform the @entity18 and fundamentally change @entity4 's relationship with it			1
' for too long this issue has been swept under the carpet and i believe it is time to deal with it			2
if i am returned as prime minister , that is what i will do			0
' so i say to the @entity48 people : give me another term and i will give you your say on @entity5			0
' mr @entity0 said there were other @entity18 leaders ' who will breathe a sigh of relief ' if he is not re-elected			1
the prime minister 's remarks came after mr @entity14 said he was ' ready to help @entity0 ' – but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new @entity5 treaty within the next two years before holding an @entity18 referendum			1
the former @entity15 prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 @entity18 leaders that would satisfy mr @entity0			1
he said : ' i have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework			0
we have to help @entity0 because he is obviously pro-european			2
but mr @entity14 added : ' i am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty			1
' @entity14 , the @entity15 president of the @entity16 which represents @entity18 leaders , greeted mr @entity0 today after claiming that his bid to rewrite the @entity18 treaties to curb migration would be ' close to @entity21 ' mr @entity0 wants a new @entity23 treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing @entity4 to limit benefits for @entity18 migrants			1
the pm has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis - hit @entity88 , giving @entity4 the chance to renegotiate its relationship with @entity23			1
but mr @entity14 said : ' my intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it 's not only about rationality , about good argument			1
' we need unanimity between 28 member states , in the @entity5 parliament , in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification			0
to say that it is a @entity105 is too little			0
' mr @entity14 said : ' first of all we need more precise concrete [ details ] about @entity48 demands			1
' when we have more information about details , about legal problems , then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary			0
' for me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question			0
it 's not only about the arguments of @entity0			1
i can agree or disagree with some of them			0
' but at the end of the day i would like to ask him ' what is your concrete proposal ? ' and then i can consult with the other member states			0
' but he said : ' we need , also for the @entity48 , a good solution for @entity0 and @entity4 under existing law , ' he said			1
' we need the @entity48 in @entity5			0
for me there 's no more obvious political thesis than this one			0
and i feel , but it 's not my role to decide about it , but i feel that the @entity48 needs @entity5			0
' the former @entity15 prime minister 's remarks are the first since he took over as european council president in december			0
he also admitted , in an interview with the @entity138 , that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration – because of the number of @entity15 living and working abroad			0
he said : ' it 's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems , which means also the huge @entity15 minority in @entity4			2

@entity18 chief @entity14 said it would be ' @entity21 ' for @entity0
@entity6 wants to renegotiate @entity4 's relationship with @entity23 before 2017
mr @entity0 has vowed to hold an in - out referendum on the new deal
today he insisted he wanted to be ' just as effective ' as @entity1
