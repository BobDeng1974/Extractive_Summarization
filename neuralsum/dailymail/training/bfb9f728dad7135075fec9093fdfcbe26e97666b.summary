i ’m in the middle of a beautiful dream			1
in this vision , i am lying on a wide , deserted beach			1
the @entity5 is ringing through my headphones ( ‘ oh , sweet nothing ! ’ ) and the afternoon sun is warming the backs of my arms and legs			1
‘ perhaps i 'll swim in the ocean , i think to myself			1
or fish around in my bag for a book			1
or maybe i should go inside and fetch a cold beer from the fridge			1
’ i smile inwardly with a sort of zen - like smugness			1
i have come to an important decision : i 'm going to do nothing			1
nothing seems by far the best option			1
and then we can play @entity23 : @entity24 is a splendid spot for a family holiday i am rudely awoken by a four - year - old boy pulling violently on my thumb			1
‘ can we play @entity23 now ? ’ he asks me			1
i glance at my phone			1
suddenly , i can not seem to remember : a ) who i am b ) where i am or c ) why i ’m here			2
after some soul - searching , i come up with : a ) a middle - aged man from @entity34 b ) @entity24 , @entity36 c ) on a family holiday with my wife and two kids			1
after i have grasped these three salient facts , things begin to fall into place again , and i ’m able to distract my youngest son with a box of apple juice			2
within a minute or two of playing @entity47 to his @entity23 , we both fall asleep again - and i ’m back on my fantasy sun lounger			2
if you are planning on doing nothing - or at least trying to - @entity24 could well be your dream destination			1
in this sleepy , prosperous corner of southern @entity36 , nothing is on the menu every day - and it is invariably delicious			1
this is where @entity56 comes to do nothing			2
where @entity58 comes to do nothing			2
where @entity60 and @entity61 came to do nothing			1
it is where infamous stockbroker and conman @entity64 convinced his victims to part with their life savings			2
and in return , he offered them , well , nothing , as it turns out			2
a place for relaxation : @entity24 offers white sands and sunshine 70 miles north of @entity74 it is also extremely expensive			1
@entity24 is one of the richest towns in the @entity78 , which goes some way to explaining why the guests at our hotel ( we ’re staying at @entity83 ) do n’t seem in the slightest bit phased by the $ 25 ( £ 15 ) cost of the cocktails			1
still , there really is no arguing with the beauty of the hotel ’s private beach			2
on our first morning , i am gripped with a giddy euphoria			2
it is as though all this white sand were a drug entering my system through the pores of my pallid , city - dweller 's skin			1
the sky is perfect , the sand is perfect , the temperature of the sea , perfect			2
my shoulders drop about three inches from their default , hunched - up , hassled parent position , and any trace of angst seems to wash away in the broad , clean waves of the @entity111			1
the kids are having a ball , too			2
we spend hours switching from ocean to pool , then pool to ocean			2
there is a wonderful , lolling rhythm to it all , and as smiling hostesses unfurl umbrellas and serve ice - cold lemonade to our ocean - view table , i feel no pain			2
to top it all , there is hot and cold running childcare			2
the boys fall instantly in love with our 19 - year - old babysitter @entity131			2
and as my wife and i head out of the door later that evening , they seem positively delighted to see the back of us			2
we take a taxi along eight miles of winding coastal road , spotting @entity60 ’s ex-pad and @entity58 ’s private club along the way			1
i wonder if @entity58 is familiar with @entity141 ’s old adage : ' i do n’t care to belong to any club that would have me as a member			2
' a magnet for celebrities through the ages : former @entity78 president @entity147 ( left ) used to bring his young family to @entity24 for holidays ; @entity60 and @entity61 ( right ) also had a holiday home in the area arriving in the centre of town , we feast on fire - roasted pizza at the posh but relaxed @entity156 , then head out onto the street in search of adventure			1
presumably the real parties happen behind the high walls of celebrity mansions , because the place is dead by 10pm			0
not that i ’m complaining			0
it ’s a beautiful , balmy evening , and we take a stroll through the wide streets , wandering into a restaurant - bar called @entity168			0
in the corner , a pianist is murdering @entity171 ( not literally ) , while the immaculately dressed clientele sits in virtual silence			1
it feels like a @entity176 retirement home			0
we are on the verge of giving up when a smiley lady approaches us			0
she introduces herself as @entity180 and begins to talk animatedly about turtles			0
‘ you must visit the sanctuary , ’ she insists			0
‘ your boys will love it ! ’ @entity180 introduces us to her husband , @entity187 , an eyewear mogul from @entity188			0
we make small talk for a while as they settle down at the bar to eat dinner			0
‘ you ’re not in @entity195 , right ? ’ @entity187 asks , suddenly suspicious			0
‘ @entity197 forbid , ’ i reply			0
he seems somewhat placated and very nearly smiles at me			0
‘ those hedge fund guys keep coming down here , ’ he offers , and returns to his smoked salmon without further comment			0
on the money : @entity24 exudes an affluent vibe , with sports cars and palatial homes the following morning , the four of us manage to tear ourselves away from the beach for a few hours to explore the local area			1
after a stop - off at the @entity211 ( @entity180 was right			0
it ’s fantastic ) we take a short drive to the marina for a dolphin - spotting trip on a catamaran			0
the kids are overjoyed - it ’s their first time on a boat			0
and as if on cue , a group of five or six dolphins pop up from the waves directly in front of us			0
' they ’re a little late , ' says @entity226 , our captain for the day			0
' we ’re gon na have to dock their wages			0
' when the dolphins have disappeared into the deep , @entity226 fills us in on some local history			0
‘ see that ? ’ he says , pointing to a creamy white mansion house by the water			0
‘ that ’s the old @entity147 estate			1
@entity236 would come down here twice a year with the whole family			0
’ ‘ i remember once when i was just out of college , they closed up the roads and he came tearing through town with his motorcade			0
they must ’ve been doing eighty miles an hour			1
i mean he was hauling ass ! ’ ‘ as a matter of fact , ’ says @entity226 ‘ he spent his last weekend down here in @entity24			1
just before he was assassinated in @entity250			0
” i feel a sudden stab of pity for @entity147 – and also for his kids			1
millions of @entity78 may have mourned the death of their president , but only two children mourned the death of their dad			0
tempting : @entity24 's monied vibe is visible in the boutique shops of @entity262 watching my own boys kicking their feet in the surf , i ’m acutely aware of how lucky i am			1
i do n’t mean that i ’m lucky to be in sunny @entity36 , or even to be staying in a fancy hotel - although i ’m grateful for both those things			1
no. more than anything , i feel lucky to be right here in this moment with the people i love the most			0
i do n’t go with all that rubbish about the devil and idle hands			0
do nothing , i say			0
do it while you can			0
