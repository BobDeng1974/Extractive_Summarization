by @entity0 last updated at 12:29 pm on 17th november 2011 shocking tragedy : @entity2 was kidnapped from a @entity4 shopping centre and killed two young boys apparently tried to lure a young girl away from her mother in a supermarket , in a chilling echo of the @entity2 abduction			1
police have arrested an 11 - year - old and a 12 - year - old in connection with the incident			1
they are now trying to trace the girl 's mother , who reported the incident to a security guard at a branch of @entity21 in the @entity23 area of @entity4 - just a few miles away from where two - year - old @entity24 was kidnapped and killed by @entity25 and @entity2 in 1993			1
@entity24 's mother , @entity2 , said the disturbing echo of her son 's case made her blood run cold			1
' hearing of the incident from police sent a chill down my spine , it 's so similar to what happened to my @entity24 , ' said mrs @entity39			1
' it 's so important that this mother comes forward to tell the full story of what happened			2
' the police must have some real concern about what is shown on the @entity46 and it 's right they should treat this seriously			2
they need to get to the bottom of this and she is a vital witness			2
' the two who abducted and murdered my son were ten , but they did the worst things imaginable			1
sick : this @entity46 image shows the abduction of two - year - old @entity2 from the @entity59 shopping mall on february 12 , 1993 by @entity2 , holding @entity24 ' hand here , and @entity25 ' i 've been told that the pair involved in this are eleven and twelve but age should never be an excuse			1
' i 've seen some very calculating children			2
these days some kids are so hard and knowing about the world , they are not like normal children at all			2
they act like little adults			2
' these two could have been intending to do something terrible to the child they tried to lure away			0
the thought of it made my blood run cold			0
appeal : a @entity46 image of the mother who reported that her girl was allegedly enticed away by two boys ' in this case , thank @entity82 , nothing bad happened , but it could very easily have been a different story			0
' mrs @entity39 urged mothers who are likely to be shopping with their children over the festive period to be vigilant when heading into crowded places with their kids			0
she said that the lesson of history should be a warning sign to mothers who , now more than ever , need to be on their guards			0
mrs @entity39 said : ' people know how something like this can happen and we all need to be on our guard			0
' it only takes a few seconds and a child can be lured away as it did with my @entity24			0
' so often you see " lost children " in supermarkets and yet people walk past them			0
i say that should never happen			0
' if there is a lost child or anything suspicious it is up to any adult to take an interest and alert the responsible authorities			0
' most of all , it is essential to challenge any children who claim to be left in charge of much younger ones in public			0
these days that just should not happen			0
' if the people who saw @entity24 when he was led away had stepped - in , as they should have done , he could be alive today			1
' child killers : @entity2 , left , and @entity25 , who kidnapped toddler @entity2 at a @entity4 shopping centre and murdered him in 1993 the two youths aged 11 and 12 arrested in connection with this incident have been released on police bail pending further enquiries			1
@entity134 police confirmed they are still unsure as to the ' full circumstances ' which led to the mother reporting the school - aged children to a store guard , who in - turn called police , on november 6			1
@entity141 released a @entity46 image of the mother and urged her to step forward to help with their investigations			0
the girl is believed to be aged between three and five			0
the branch of @entity21 on @entity148 , in @entity4 , where a mother reported to an in - store security guard that two youths had attempted to coax her child away ' this is a very disturbing incident , and i 'm sure it would have caused a great deal of distress for this woman and her child , ' said a police spokesman			1
' we are treating this report very seriously and are very keen for this woman to come forward , so we can piece together the full circumstances of this incident			1
' thankfully incidents such as this are rare and while we are not sure of the intentions of the two youths , we would urge members of the public to always reports any incident of this nature to police immediately by calling 999			1

11 - year - old and 12 - year - old arrested
