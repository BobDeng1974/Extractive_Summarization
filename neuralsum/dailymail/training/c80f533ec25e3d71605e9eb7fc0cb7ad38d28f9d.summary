@entity0 might be spearheading @entity2 's quest for three trophies this season , but manager @entity5 is still demanding more from his star player			1
@entity2 face @entity7 on tuesday night with @entity0 fresh from signing a new five - and - a - half - year deal at @entity9 - and @entity5 now expects the playmaker to step up his goalscoring exploits to match the best players in the world			1
the @entity15 's benchmarks for the @entity16 are @entity17 ( with 38 goals in 35 appearances this season ) and @entity21 ( 37 in 36 ) - although @entity0 's ratio of 13 goals in 39 games show he has some way to go yet			1
@entity0 trains ahead of facing @entity7 - and @entity5 wants him to start scoring more for @entity2 hazard has scored 13 goals in 39 appearances this season - some way off the world 's best players ' @entity5 would like for me to score more , ' @entity0 told @entity34 tv station @entity33			1
' @entity36 forwards need to score and to pass			0
but i think i compensate for that given how many chances i create			0
' i 'm fouled a lot , there are a lot of free - kicks and penalties that i win			0
but he 'd like me to score more , like those great players ( @entity21 and @entity17 ) who score two or three times each game			1
' hazard is in his third season at @entity9 following a £ 32million move from @entity51 in the summer of 2012 and he admits that for a player of his talent he should be scoring more			2
the @entity16 playmaker feels the number of free - kicks and penalties he wins compensates for his lack of goals @entity17 and @entity21 are still some way clear of @entity0 in the goalscoring stakes ' apart from my last season in @entity34 i was always reproached for not being clinical enough , a good player but not clinical			1
progressively i ’ve taken that on board and i ’ve often managed to be clinical in the big games			2
' i ’m continuing to improve			0
i ’m only 24 and i ’ve done some pretty good things in football already			0
so i hope it continues like this , that we ’ll win trophies this year and again next year			0
we ’ll be able to get better every season			0
' hazard is hoping for trophies this season with @entity2 top of the @entity77 and still in two cups			2
