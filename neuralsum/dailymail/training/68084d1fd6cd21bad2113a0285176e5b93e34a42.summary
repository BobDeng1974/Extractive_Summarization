@entity0 , who died on monday after suffering a fatal heart attack in a downmarket @entity3 coffee shop @entity5 was her great - niece , @entity4 had been her sister - in - law , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were among her mother ’s lovers , and she grew up in a @entity12 mansion once owned by billionaire @entity13 and @entity14			1
but it was in a downmarket 24 - hour coffee shop that former @entity17 princess @entity0 , 67 , suffered a fatal heart attack on monday and later died in hospital			1
friends of @entity0 , the only child of screen siren @entity21 , claim she had felt depressed for weeks and kept repeating that she wanted to die			1
for @entity0 was down and out , living sometimes in a car and sometimes in a sleazy @entity17 motel			2
as the ghost - writer of her mother @entity28 ’s autobiography , one @entity29 is not enough , i first met @entity0 in the early @entity30			1
she had last contacted me two months ago			0
for years she had been working on her own autobiography , tentatively entitled hotels , diamonds and me , and there was talk that she might want to work with me on the book , though nothing came of it			0
it ’s a shame , because @entity0 had one hell of a story to tell			2
the only child born to @entity28 — one of @entity45 sisters the @entity46 , who specialised in marrying rich men and collecting magnificent jewellery along the way — @entity0 would appear to have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth			1
her blonde bombshell mother had starred in the 1952 hit film @entity53 and then made a name for herself as a tv personality , uttering such bon mots as : ‘ i ’m a great housekeeper			0
when i divorce a man , i always keep his house			0
’ but she was n’t worth a fortune			0
as for @entity61 , the hotel magnate whose name @entity0 bore , he never even mentioned her in his 1957 memoir and left her just $ 100,000 of his fortune , worth about $ 6 billion ( nearly £ 4 billion ) in today ’s money , when he died in 1979			1
in the decades that followed , @entity0 devoted her life and any money she had to fighting her father ’s will , but lost resoundingly — and even , under a quirk of @entity74 law , forfeited the original $ 100,000			1
those who knew her believe her fight was n’t just for money but to establish without doubt that @entity61 was her father — which he once disputed to her but not to @entity28 , who said that if he did ‘ i would have killed him ’			1
back in the @entity97 , the right - hand woman of @entity61 ’s son , @entity96 , told me that @entity0 ’s father was not conrad but the actor @entity99			1
the resemblance to @entity99 is startling			0
to the end , @entity0 considered herself a @entity61			1
but if she was on shaky ground there , anyone who saw her with her mother felt that she did n’t resemble her much , either			0
with her matchless allure , which had captivated billionaire @entity112 ( who wanted to marry her ) , the @entity106 and two @entity108 presidents , @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity28 was dedicated to her beauty , glamour and sex drive ( she once confided to me that she liked a man to be rough in bed )			2
as a child , @entity0 adored her mother , but @entity28 did her best to turn her little girl into a live - in photo opportunity , throwing her lavish birthday parties to which she invited reporters from @entity123			1
@entity28 with her daughter , left , in the 1950s and right in the 1960s			2
as @entity0 grew up , though , @entity28 was dismayed when she balked against wearing make - up and losing weight , and rejected the glamorous @entity21 image as @entity0 grew up , though , @entity28 was dismayed when she balked against wearing make - up and losing weight , and rejected the glamorous @entity21 image			1
instead , @entity0 was honest , funny , cynical and bright , so that when young reality tv star @entity5 hit the headlines , she remarked : ‘ i ’m the original @entity61 heiress			1
i ’m older , wiser , smarter			0
and i ’m damned wider			0
’ although @entity0 did n’t grow up to be a man - eater like her mother , she had a crush on singer @entity133 , dated @entity134 and once infuriated @entity135 by flirting openly with @entity135 ’s then husband , @entity136			1
as a child , @entity0 adored her mother , but @entity28 did her best to turn her little girl into a live - in photo opportunity yet love , happiness and career success eluded her			1
@entity61 refused to pay her an allowance and would n’t even let her stay one night on his luxurious estate			2
only once did he grant her a temporary role in his hotel empire , as a receptionist at the @entity147 , where guests flatly refused to believe she was a member of his family			0
after that , @entity0 tried valiantly to become a professional photographer , then an actress , and managed to play a few bit parts in films			0
her last career was as a stand - up comedienne , in an act that consisted of poking fun at @entity28 ( ‘ my mother and i , we ’re the best of friends now we ’re the same age ’ ) , her heritage and , above all , herself			1
towards the end of her life , though , @entity0 had very little to laugh about			0
after marrying and divorcing eight men , in 1986 @entity28 married her final husband			2
born @entity171 , a policeman ’s son from @entity173 , her new spouse — who purported to be 27 years her junior — had been adopted as an adult by the elderly @entity177 princess @entity176			0
now going by the title of @entity171 , which is his legal right , he paid a contact $ 5,000 to introduce him to @entity28 , then married her			2
@entity28 and @entity171 fought constantly , but she was proud of their bawdy sex life and even prouder that she — ‘ a little girl from @entity182 ’ — bore one of the most ancient titles in @entity185			0
@entity171 fought a dogged battle to keep @entity0 away from @entity28			1
on the few occasions when he allowed them to meet , @entity0 found her mother his virtual prisoner			2
stricken with dementia and with one leg amputated , @entity28 was able only to squeeze @entity0 ’s hand to let her know she knew who she was			1
‘ she once called me @entity196 , so that ’s how i announce myself , ’ @entity0 said wryly			0
‘ i say : “ mother , the brat ’s here			0
” ’ @entity21 pictured with her husband @entity171 in 2011			2
@entity171 fought a dogged battle to keep @entity0 away from @entity28 but @entity0 was far from being a brat			1
she was a tortured woman who grew up with very little love , grappling with a mother more concerned with herself than with her child			0
‘ do i have breakfast with my mother ? of course not			0
she always has it in bed , ’ she once said , without bitterness			0
since her death was announced , @entity171 has said openly that he has no intention of letting his wife , now 97 , know that her only daughter is dead			0
so even in death , @entity0 is denied access to the mother who never gave her the reassurance she craved , but whom @entity0 loved so much .			2

@entity0 , 67 , died on monday after suffering from fatal heart attack
said she was depressed for weeks and kept repeating she wanted to die
was the only child of @entity21 and her father was @entity61
@entity28 mother was dismayed when her daughter refused to wear make - up
has had little contact with her mother whose husband kept her away
