by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 18:08 est , 26 april 2013 @entity3 taxpayers are to fund a prison building programme in poor countries such as @entity6 and @entity7 so more foreign inmates languishing in @entity3 jails can be sent home , @entity1 announced yesterday			1
the prime minister admitted that too many foreign prisoners remained in this country and said ‘ helping to build prisons in their own country ’ would ensure more were kicked out			1
despite promises to cut the number of foreign inmates behind bars in @entity3 , the numbers have increased in recent years			1
@entity1 argued that helping improve prisons abroad could mean that more foreign prisoners in the @entity3 can be sent back home ministers have struggled to remove even hardened criminals because jails abroad are overflowing or do not comply with human rights laws			1
by paying for building new jails or making existing ones more ‘ comfortable ’ so they approach @entity3 standards it is hoped more will be repatriated			1
but sending money abroad to lock up prisoners there , in addition to the billions spent in foreign aid , while budgets are being cut at home , will prove highly controversial			1
mr @entity1 made his comments during a ‘ @entity44 ’ event on the local elections campaign trail in @entity43			0
he said : ‘ when people are sent to prison in the @entity3 we should do everything we can to make sure that if they ’re foreign nationals , they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison			1
‘ and i ’m taking action in @entity54 to say look we have strong relationships with all of the countries where these people come from			2
‘ many are coming from @entity7 , many from @entity6 , many from other countries in @entity61			1
( @entity64 image ) prisons in poorer countries can fail to meet human rights standards and can be overcrowded ‘ we should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries			1
even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home			1
‘ i ’m going to be setting out a programme of how we do that , country by country by country			0
because it is not good enough , the situation we have in @entity3 today			1
’ since 2010 there has been a sharp fall in the number of serious criminals sent home			2
that year , 5,342 were deported			0
the following year - the first full 12 months of coalition government - the figure was down 13 per cent to 4,649			0
in the first nine months of 2012 some 3,382 were deported - suggesting the annual total would fall even further			0
there are now 10,861 foreign inmates in @entity3 jails , who now make up around 14 per cent of the prison population			1
each costs an average of around £ 40,000 a year to keep inside			0
entire prisons have been handed over to the immigration estate to keep inside prolific offenders after the end of their sentence , and every month around 110 are released out on to the streets			2
more than two years ago mr @entity1 pledged to ‘ intervene personally ’ in the issue , but there has been little progress			0
there are more prisoners from @entity7 ( pictured ) than any other foreign nationality , followed by @entity106 and @entity107			2
this week the @entity108 revealed hundreds of foreign criminals could be given cautions instead of jail if they agree to leave the country for at least five years			0
yesterday mr @entity1 hailed a transfer agreement with @entity115 countries designed to send more home			2
he said that as a result of the deal ‘ those prisoners should be sent back to the country of their origin to serve out their sentence in prison therefore taking the cost away from us			2
’ but the @entity108 revealed that as of december last year , not a single inmate from another @entity115 country has been sent back to their homeland			0
risibly , the two countries with the most inmates in @entity106 and @entity107 - were given opt - outs by the previous @entity132 government			2
and @entity3 has been sent two prisoners by other countries - meaning the deal has actually increased our ‘ @entity138 ’ prison population			1
@entity7 top the nationality table , with 900 last year , followed by @entity106 on 750 , and @entity107 737			0
@entity3 should be able to say ‘ good bye ’ to @entity141 as a result of a deal with @entity144 , @entity1 said yesterday			1
and the pm did not rule out leaving the @entity147 to ensure the radical cleric can be removed			0
he said : ‘ he should be in @entity144			0
we ’ve got an agreement with the @entity144 that he ’ll be properly treated			0
‘ we should now be able to say good bye to @entity141			0

taxpayers will fund prisons in poorer countries such as @entity6
the @entity146 admitted that too many foreign prisoners remain in the @entity3
the move could result in more inmates being sent home
number of prisoners has increased despite promises to reduce the figures
