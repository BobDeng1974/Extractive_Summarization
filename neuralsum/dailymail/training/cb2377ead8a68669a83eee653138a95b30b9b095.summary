by @entity0 relieved @entity1 was last night told he would not require facial surgery after suffering extensive damage to his nose when a short - pitched delivery from @entity6 smashed through the protective grille of his helmet			1
the @entity10 fast bowler top - edged a delivery into his face after hitting @entity6 for successive sixes and was forced to retire hurt for 12 , helped from the field by the team ’s medical staff with blood pouring from his nose			1
the 28 - year - old was taken to a nearby @entity21 hospital shortly afterwards with his badly swollen nose heavily bandaged but was referred to a second hospital where a specialist in facial reconstructive techniques was able to assess the damage			1
he is still expected to be fit for the fifth test next friday			0
@entity1 confirmed this week he will have surgery at the end of the series on a condition called patella tendinitis , caused by wear and tear on the knee joint but , if he is unable to play at @entity50 , he could fly to @entity62 this week for a second bout of surgery			1
the gruesome damage to his nose , caused when the ball slipped between the protective grille and the peak of his helmet , caused questions to be raised about the safety of modern headwear			1
he was wearing a relatively new helmet design made by @entity76 - based company @entity75 , which havs become increasingly popular among international players in recent years and claims to employ a unique ‘ @entity78 ’ ( @entity78 )			2
the manufacturers also claim the sharper peak to the helmet makes it less likely for a ball to sneak between the grille and the lid			2
yesterday it emerged that a new @entity87 safety standard is being finalised aimed at making cricket helmets safer in an attempt to prevent similar injuries in future			0
‘ the old @entity94 did n’t even test the grille impacts and that was an obvious flaw , ’ said @entity92 , the chief executive of the @entity93			0
‘ so we have been working with the @entity98 , the @entity99 and @entity94 over the last couple of years and that new standard is ready to be implemented			2
’ the new safety standards will limit the ability of players to adjust their protective grille settings — with a maximum of 55mm recommended			0
‘ one of the things in the new standard is that it changes the ability of a user to set the protective grille and leave an unsafe gap , ’ said @entity92			0
‘ with the new designs there is often no ability to adjust the gap between the peak and the grille which is not necessarily popular with the players but which is necessary			0
