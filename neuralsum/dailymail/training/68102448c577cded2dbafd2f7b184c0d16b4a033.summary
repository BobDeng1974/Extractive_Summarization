by @entity0 the @entity1 has launched a major probe into why @entity4 consumers often suffer with slow internet connection while watching online video			0
the inquiry announced by @entity1 chairman @entity8 will dissect the routes that video and other data travel to reach internet service providers such as @entity13 and @entity14			0
@entity15 and other critics have accused the two internet service providers of deliberately slowing incoming traffic from websites unwilling to pay for a less congested entry point			1
@entity1 chairman @entity8 today pledged to unravel the mystery behind the internet traffic jams bogging down the delivery of @entity15 videos and other online content			1
@entity13 and @entity14 contend @entity15 should bear some of the cost for handling the heavy traffic caused by its 36 million @entity4 subscribers watching video over high - speed internet connections			1
at peak viewing hours , @entity15 accounts for about one - third of the internet traffic in the @entity4 , according to the research firm @entity33			1
the picture quality of @entity15 video , though , has been increasingly erratic during the past year at several major internet service providers , including @entity13 and @entity14 , which have a combined 30 million subscribers in the @entity4 while @entity15 has been streaming more smoothly at @entity13 since those two companies forged their partnership in february , some problems have still been occurring on @entity14 's network			1
@entity15 ceo @entity42 has continued sniping at both @entity13 and @entity14 , arguing they should be able to afford to deliver whatever online content that their subscribers want , given that their customers pay $ 50 to $ 80 per month for their internet service			2
@entity15 charges $ 8 to $ 12 per month for its internet video service			2
with the @entity1 inquiry , @entity8 hopes to get a better understanding of how @entity15 and other websites are reaching the internet service providers through interconnection , or ' peering , ' arrangements			2
' the bottom line is that consumers need to understand what is occurring when the internet service they 've paid for does not adequately deliver the content they desire , especially content they 've also paid for , ' @entity8 said in a statement			0
@entity15 's most recent @entity64 speed chart revealing the fastest and slowest providers			0
it has accused providers such as @entity13 and @entity14 of throttling its service			0
in the process , the @entity1 also could shed more light on whether @entity15 is saving money in its peering deals with @entity13 and @entity14			0
although the terms of the partnerships have n't been disclosed , both @entity13 and @entity14 have suggested @entity15 is paying them less for a direct connection to their network than what it previously cost @entity15 to deliver video through other intermediaries			2
in a rare show of unanimity , @entity15 and @entity13 both said they welcomed the @entity1 's inquiry in the interests of greater transparency			0
@entity14 reaffirmed its support for the status quo and pointed out that ' @entity88 traffic exchange has always been handled through commercial agreements			1
' the tensions over peering arrangements is part of a much larger debate over internet neutrality , the concept that all online traffic should be treated equally so service providers ca n't set up a system that gives special preference to their own content or websites willing to pay for privileged access			0
the @entity1 's previous guidelines for so - called net neutrality were scrapped by a federal appeals court in january , requiring @entity8 to draw up new rules			1
@entity8 's initial blueprint for net neutrality raised fears that he was going to empower @entity88 service providers to charge for toll roads , a fear that @entity8 has sought to quell in his public statements			1
@entity113 in @entity114 : the huge popularity of @entity15 shows has caused problems for some providers who claims there is too much traffic			2
now regulators plan to find out exactly where the bottleneck is			0
peering deals have n't been considered to be part of net neutrality , but @entity127 is pushing for interconnection to become part of the equation			1
@entity127 ' critics believe he is seizing an opportune time to publicly skewer @entity88 service providers in an attempt to eliminate all peering fees and boost @entity15 's earnings			1
he has been escalating his attacks while @entity13 has been trying to win government approval of its politically sensitive $ 45 billion acquisition of @entity141 , another major @entity64			0
@entity127 is urging regulators to reject that deal on the grounds that it might make it even easier for @entity13 to impose internet tolls on content providers			0
former @entity1 commissioner @entity148 , now president of @entity149 , blasted @entity15 and other unnamed @entity88 companies for trying to ' move the goal posts ' to suit their own interests			1
' they want to protect their profits by ensuring that the disproportionate impact caused by delivering traffic to their customers is spread across all broadband subscribers and not just those who actually use the service , ' @entity148 wrote in a blog post earlier this week .			0
