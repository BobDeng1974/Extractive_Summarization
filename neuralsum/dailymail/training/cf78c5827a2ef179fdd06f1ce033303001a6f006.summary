by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 26 november 2013 a photographer has won a landmark legal battle with retail giant @entity3 after his picture of a stunt biker was taken off the internet , adapted and printed on children 's t - shirts without his permission			1
father - of - three @entity10 , 55 , captured the image of rider @entity12 at the annual @entity13 in @entity14 in june 2010			1
it shows the 23 - year - old in mid-air with both his hands off the handlebars and his legs to one side of the red bike			0
but mr @entity10 admitted he was stunned when he spotted his photograph on a child 's t - shirt while out shopping , with the biker 's head replaced with that of a chimp			1
spot the difference : @entity33 motorcycle photographer @entity10 ' picture , left , was stolen and printed on t - shirts by @entity3 , right , who have settled over the matter a supplier for the high street chain had found the original picture on the internet and taken it without his permission			1
the extreme sports photographer launched a legal battle with @entity3 this summer over the unauthorised use of his picture			0
and in a landmark victory on friday @entity3 accepted his ownership of the photo and agreed to pay him undisclosed damages			1
offending item : @entity3 has accepted mr @entity10 ' his ownership of the photo and agreed to pay him undisclosed damages after selling this t - shirt the company will now send all remaining stock of the shirt - which had appeared in its directory , online and in its 500 @entity58 stores - to aid charity @entity59 for its overseas work			1
it has also emerged @entity3 has even offered more money to buy the image - but he refused ' on principle			0
' mr @entity10 , from @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , said : ' the original image is so easy to recognise , there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that they ripped off my shot and mass produced it on a t - shirt selling for £ 5 to £ 10			2
' it was fortunate that my original copyrighted image was so easily recognisable by @entity79 ( freestyle motocross ) followers			0
' so i was soon alerted to the misuse of this photograph and felt it was vital to take action to stop its use as soon as possible			0
' donating the remaining t - shirts to @entity59 means that some good has come from this episode and will mean that it remains a much more pleasant memory for me than it otherwise could have been			1
' @entity94 , from law firm @entity91 who represented him , added : ' @entity10 was understandably worried that it could harm his reputation if it was thought he had sold this picture to the fashion chain			2
' we therefore had to act fast to protect his reputation			0
' in this case , @entity10 was able to produce a photograph which was timed and dated as evidence he owned copyright in the image			2
' it was also accepted that the photograph was used without his consent when it became apparent that @entity3 's supplier had simply found the original image online			1
' those factors all meant the matter could be resolved promptly by agreement			0
' a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' the t - shirts have been withdrawn from sale			2
' the remaining stock is being collated in our warehouse ready to be donated to @entity59			0
' dispute : @entity119 won a battle with @entity121 over a t - shirt bearing the picture of her face , seen left , which she claimed is similar to one of her album covers and could mislead fans into believing the item was ' genuine ' earlier this year pop superstar @entity119 won a permanent ban on @entity121 selling t - shirts using her image			2
sir @entity133 's high street fashion chain were also ordered to pay her estimated legal costs of almost £ 1million .			0

@entity10 , 55 , spotted his photo in a next store while out shopping
image had a chimp 's head added by a supplier who saw the photo online
next accepted he owned image and agreed to pay him undisclosed damages
remaining t - shirts will be sold to raise money for @entity59 's work abroad
