by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 4 july 2013 scientists have grown a tiny liver in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients scientists have grown a tiny liver – in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients			1
the technique could one day be used to patch up diseased and damaged organs , removing the agonising – and sometimes unsuccessful – wait for a transplant			0
the manmade tissue could also be used to test new medicines , preventing disasters such as the ‘ @entity19 ’ drug trial , in which six men were left fighting for their lives			1
new kidneys , lungs and pancreases could be grown using the same technique			2
the research is still at a very early stage but @entity27 experts have described it as a ‘ huge step forward ’ and as holding out ‘ real promise ’ for an alternative to organ transplants			1
more than 7,000 @entity27 are on the transplant list , including 154 children			2
the vast majority are waiting for new kidneys but almost 500 are in need of a liver and around 250 are waiting for healthy lungs to become available			2
the @entity41 researchers used the three types of cell that generate the liver in a human embryo to grow a tiny piece of tissue in a dish			1
it was then grafted on to a mouse ’s brain , where it hooked up to the blood supply and grew for at least two months			0
the manmade tissue had many of the hallmarks of a working human liver , including the ability to break down drugs			1
in experiments , the manmade tissue also extended the life of rodents with fatal liver disease , the journal @entity63 reports			1
the scientists chose the brain because it was easy for them to attach the piece of liver and watch it at work			1
however , with human patients , the pieces would actually be used to patch up the liver			1
it is hoped the first tests on people can be done in a decade			1
researcher @entity75 , of @entity76 , said the first patients are likely to be babies and children with severe liver disease			2
but , in time , adults could also benefit			0
he added that he believes that his recipe for growing patches of liver is more natural than those being perfected by other scientists and holds ‘ enormous therapeutic potential ’ for transplant patients			2
dr @entity89 , a stem cell scientist from @entity91 , said : ‘ the strategy is very promising and represents a huge step forward			0
’ dr @entity94 , of @entity95 , cautioned that the technique wo n’t be suitable for all transplant patients , but added : ‘ nevertheless , the study holds out real promise for a viable alternative approach to human organ transplants			1

more than 7,000 @entity27 are on the transplant list , including 154 children			0
almost 500 people are in need of a liver professor @entity115 , an expert in regenerative medicine from @entity117 , said the manmade pieces of tissue may be most useful when testing new medicines			1
if the patches of liver struggle to break down the chemicals , the treatments could be shelved before they do harm			2
in 2006 , six previously healthy young men were admitted to intensive care after taking part in trials of a new drug at @entity130 in north @entity131			0
one man ’s head swelled up so much that his fiancée to likened him to the @entity19			0
another spent five months in hospital with heart , liver and kidney failure			0
he lost some fingers and all his toes were amputated			0
in other cases , drugs have been withdrawn after they have hit the market			0
@entity146 , of @entity147 , which runs the organ donor register , said : ‘ the work currently being carried out in the field of regenerative medicine to “ engineer ” organs for transplant is very exciting			0
‘ with further development , it could one day help to tackle the acute shortage of organs available for transplant here in the @entity27			0
' however , it is likely to be many years before these scientific advances translate into a form of widespread , readily - available treatment for patients			0
‘ in the meantime , if we are to reduce the number of people who die every year due to the lack of available organs , we need more people to discuss organ donation with their families and join the @entity147 organ donor register			2
