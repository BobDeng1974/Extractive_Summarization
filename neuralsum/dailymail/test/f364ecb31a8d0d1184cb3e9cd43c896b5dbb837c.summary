@entity0 are preparing bids for @entity3 trio @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity5 as part of a summer @entity7 of their squad			1
the club are well aware of a lack of homegrown talent at senior level with the departure of @entity15 and uncertainty over @entity18 's future exacerbating the problem			1
@entity21 chiefs have moved to address the situation and are expected to lodge offers for @entity24 winger @entity2 , @entity25 midfielder @entity4 and @entity26 striker @entity5			1
@entity2 would cost in region of £ 50million but the forward could buy out the final year of his contract @entity25 midfielder @entity4 has been inconsistent this season but would command a hefty fee @entity26 striker @entity5 has not played this season but @entity0 are monitoring his return from injury club bosses believe the young pair on @entity39 , aged 20 and 21 , can not only make an impact at fist - team level but can inject youth into an ageing squad			1
@entity2 has refused to sign a new £ 100,000 - a - week contract at @entity45 , with the player and his advisers believing they can get £ 150,000 elsewhere			1
the @entity49 flyer is valued at £ 50m			0
however , he can buy out the final year of his contract for £ 1.7m , which may force @entity24 to accept an effectively half - priced bid of £ 25m			0
@entity4 has had an inconsistent season , summed up by his penalty miss in saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity56 , but is still expected to command a hefty fee			1
city are long - term admirers of @entity5 , 25 , and have been monitoring his comeback from a injury			2
the @entity63 lad suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury against @entity0 and @entity26 boss @entity65 revealed he could return to action in the final game of the season against the same side			2
@entity15 was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this season , but will leave in the summer @entity74 rules state that clubs must have eight homegrown players in squads of 25			1
to achieve homegrown status , players born outside the @entity79 can qualify as long as they have been at a club 's academy for three years before their 21st birthday			2
if clubs can not find eight they have to reduce their squads accordingly			0
@entity0 's list featured six homegrown players this term including @entity15 , who will join sister club @entity88 in july and @entity18 who is still pondering his future			1
their contract offer to former @entity94 and @entity95 man @entity18 remains on the table , however , there is interest from @entity74 rivals @entity24 and @entity99 and a host of clubs from @entity102 and @entity103			0
despite rumours to the contrary , the 29 - year - old @entity104 is yet to decide where his future lies			0
@entity49 international @entity18 is out of contract in the summer and is considering his options @entity18 can now speak @entity110 after enlisting the help of a private tutor and regularly tests his newly - attained skill out on the likes of @entity115 and @entity116 , although the arrival of a baby daughter last summer may keep him on home soil			2
after a poor run of form @entity0 , whose under 18s take on @entity124 in the first leg of the @entity126 on monday night , will not retain their @entity74 title and securing a @entity129 place is paramount to their plans			0
should they fail to do so an under - pressure @entity133 will face the axe			0
despite intense speculation linking outgoing @entity137 manager @entity136 with the post , @entity133 is expected to see out the final year of his contract should his side finish in the top four .			0

@entity0 will make a *concerted* effort to sign @entity3 players
@entity2 , @entity4 and @entity5 are all on the *wanted* list
city chiefs are concerned about lack of homegrown players at senior level
@entity15 will leave in summer and @entity18 's future is uncertain
