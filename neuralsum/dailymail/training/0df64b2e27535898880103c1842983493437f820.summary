@entity0 turned the @entity1 into class warfare , claiming that his humble origins make him ' hungrier ' than his privileged @entity5 team - mate @entity4			1
@entity0 , who is the richest sportsman in @entity6 with an estimated fortune of Â£ 68million and joined girlfriend @entity8 at a star - studded @entity10 event on thursday , grew up in an end - of - terrace house on a tough council estate in @entity14			1
he once talked of watching drug dealers from his window			2
speaking ahead of sunday 's @entity17 , @entity0 said : ' i come from a not great place in @entity14 and lived on a couch in my dad 's apartment			1
' and @entity4 grew up in @entity33 with jets and hotels and boats			1
so the hunger is different			0
i 've got to be the hungriest guy in the cockpit to win the @entity1			2
' the pair have tried to keep their rivalry friendly this season to help them cope with the pressure of being first and second in the standings			0
@entity0 now lives in @entity33 and previously spoke of how he and @entity4 played table tennis while sharing a @entity33 apartment block			1
@entity4 has since moved out and @entity0 has changed apartments			2
despite living so close to the track , @entity0 ' overslept ' on thursday			2
he had to be taken by boat to the paddock			0
he then ran along the harbour front to get into his overalls for first practice , in which he set the fastest time of the day			0
home from home : @entity4 grew up in @entity33 and walked the roads , which form the track , to get to school all eyes on me : the @entity63 has won the last four races , all with his team - mate @entity4 finishing second the second session was a damp squib			1
it rained beforehand , and with eight minutes remaining only nine cars had set times - why not introduce a regulation demanding cars do a minimum of , say , 30 laps per session unless the rain is so extreme the officials ban running ? nobody expects anything other than @entity5 coming first and second in qualifying tomorrow and in the race on sunday			0
asked for his ideal result , he said : ' @entity82 , me finishing first , @entity85 second and @entity86 third			0
' the dream result for the team would be the @entity5 cars finishing one - two and one of those guys in third .			0

@entity0 says his modest *upbringing* in @entity14 is *vastly* different to the formative years @entity4 spent in @entity33
' if i were to come here *believing* @entity4 is hungrier than me then i might as well go home . so i 've got to be the hungriest , ' he says
@entity0 heads up the *dirvers* championship , leading @entity4 by three points after four *consecutive* *victories*
