if you 're planning to go to the @entity1 of the @entity2 in @entity3 this saturday , you might be in for a bit of a surprise with the final talk of the day			2
because that 's when plasma physicist dr @entity8 will present his theory that an ancient civilisation on @entity11 was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race			1
in his bizarre theory , dr @entity8 says ancient @entity16 known as @entity17 and @entity18 were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today			1
dr @entity8 is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in @entity3 at the @entity2			1
he says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on @entity11 ( image from his paper shown ) back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity11 could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion			1
' the martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on @entity11 , ' he told @entity43 at the time			1
' a nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet			0
' aside from this outlandish theory , dr @entity8 has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career			1
he has a phd in @entity50 from the @entity51			0
currently he works as a plasma physicist at @entity53 in @entity54			0
he has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on @entity58 and @entity59			0
dr @entity8 has authored a number of books with his latest , death on @entity11 : the @entity64 , to be published in february 2015			1
but since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race			0
according to @entity70 , the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests ' may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space			2
' his research centres around the ' high concentration ' of @entity80 in the @entity11 atmosphere , and uranium and thorium on the surface , spotted by @entity87 's @entity86 spacecraft			1
scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising , as they are natural elements found everywhere			0
but dr @entity8 is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface			1
he will lay out his research tomorrow in his talk titled ' evidence of @entity97 in @entity11 past , the @entity98 , and @entity99 '			1
and he is also apparently set to have a paper published in the @entity101			0
dr @entity8 says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past , including @entity17 , the location of the famous ' face on @entity11 ' spotted from orbit ( left )			1
however , later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes ( right ) back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on @entity11 ( pictured ) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race he says @entity11 once had an @entity118 - like climate home to animal and plant life , and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient @entity122 on @entity118			1
this is based on his analysis of two regions , one being @entity17 , where the infamous - and later discredited - ' face on @entity11 ' was found			2
this , according to dr @entity8 , is an artefact from the ancient alien race			2
here , one of the supposed nuclear explosions wiped out the civilisation at @entity132 and another , smaller one destroyed a civilisation at a region called @entity135			2
' analysis of new images from @entity86 , @entity138 and @entity139 orbiters now show strong evidence of eroded archeological objects at these sites , ' he writes in the abstract for his research to be presented tomorrow			0
' taken together , the data requires that the hypothesis of @entity11 as the site of an ancient planetary nuclear massacre , must now be considered			2
' dr @entity8 says @entity11 once had an @entity118 - like climate home to animal and plant life , and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient @entity122 on @entity118 dr @entity8 says his theory could explain the @entity99 - namely why , if the universe is abundant with life , we have n't heard anything from anyone else yet			1
he warns , though , that we need to be fearful of an attack on our own planet , and should mount a manned mission to @entity11 to know what we 're up against			0
' providentially , we are forewarned of this possible aspect of the cosmos , ' he writes			0
' the author therefore advocates that a human mission to @entity11 is mounted immediately to maximise knowledge of what occurred			0
' @entity171 expert @entity170 , author of the @entity172 , told @entity173 that dr @entity8 is not the first to suggest @entity11 was ' murdered ' by nuclear explosions			1
' these stories and many variations of them present a view that our solar system was the home of several nuclear battles raged between alien visitors and settlers , ' he said			0
' much of the evidence is either channeled through automatic writing , psychic messages or the interpretation of ancient texts			0
' although @entity8 's theory is on more solid ground , it still amounts to speculation based on our present day awareness of the power of nuclear weapons and our fear of its misuse			2
' it is a warning that we could do the same to our own planet , and underlines the belief of many scientists that we have not detected intelligent life elsewhere in the universe because at some point civilisations will become extinct either through catastrophe or self - destruction			0

scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on @entity11 was massacred
dr @entity8 is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in @entity3
he says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on @entity11
these apparently wiped out two races - the @entity17 and @entity18
detection of uranium and thorium on the surface is evidence for these past explosions , he claims
and he warns we should be wary of a similar attack on @entity118
