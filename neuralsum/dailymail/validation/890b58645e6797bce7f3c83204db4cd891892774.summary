the sun that attracts most people to southern @entity2 was torture for @entity4 on wednesday but she refused to wilt in her best unyielding fashion			2
the @entity7 no 1 was resilient in the fierce mid-day heat , and edged closer to beating her career - high ranking with a sometimes agonising 3 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 victory over @entity13 ’s @entity12 to make the @entity15 second round			1
having beaten a host of highly regarded players to reach the fourth round of @entity20 last week , she nearly came unstuck against the nuggety @entity13 , ranked a modest 95 in the world			1
it was a testament to @entity4 ’s fighting qualities , rather than an advert for the silky skills of the @entity26 , but hardly less worthy for that			0
@entity4 celebrates during her three sets victory over @entity13 qualifier @entity12 @entity4 is currently ranked 41 in the world , three off her all - time best			2
she now faces @entity33 ’s @entity32 , the number fifteen seed , who has tumbled out of the top ten and is scratching around for any kind of form in 2015			2
the @entity7 no 1 is having to do it solo as well , as the only female player from @entity43 ’s host nation to inhabit the top 150 in @entity45 ’s absence			0
it is a bleak situation , and there seems little in the way of any coherent performance plan from the @entity50 to improve things			0
the 22 year - old from @entity53 usually benefits in these conditions from having spent much of her teenage years in @entity2 , although not much can make the kind of steaming heat encountered on wednesday much more comfortable 26 - year - old @entity12 hits a forehand during the prolonged contest in @entity59 with @entity4 @entity7 no 1 @entity4 with coach @entity60 during her @entity15 round one win @entity4 keeps her eye on the ball during a tough three sets victory in sweltering conditions in @entity59 after recovering from a start that made it hard to believe she had beaten @entity69 last week – her first top ten scalp – @entity4 appeared to have cracked her opponent by forging a 5 - 2 lead in the third			1
when serving for it at 5 - 3 , however , she could not finds a first serve and was broken			0
she just about squeezed through when she broke @entity12 at 6 - 5 , the @entity13 hurling her racket across the court on the final point that she lost via a net cord			1
earlier @entity79 had found out his opponent in the second round of the men ’s event to be played on friday after receiving a bye			0
@entity86 @entity85 , who he beat recently in the @entity87 , went through when his opponent @entity88 defaulted with injury at 1 - 5 down			1

@entity4 shakes hands with her @entity13 opponent having prevailed 3 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 in the @entity15 first round			1
