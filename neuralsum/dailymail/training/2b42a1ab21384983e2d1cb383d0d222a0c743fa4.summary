by @entity1 reporter published : 07:31 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 07:43 est , 11 july 2012 brandishing two handguns in a @entity5 nightclub , this scantily - clad woman shows off her new acquisition - an official sheriff 's badge proudly displayed on her cleavage			2
the image has caused uproar as the badge belongs to a @entity14 councilman at the centre of an @entity17 corruption probe who had been given the credentials by the @entity20			1
sheriff @entity21 has now decided to recall some 200 badges his department has handed out to local politicians just two weeks after the picture was released by the @entity28 attorney 's office in support of bribery charges against three city officials			1
' vulgar display ' : this picture of a woman brandishing two guns while wearing an official sheriff 's badge has re-ignited the debate about the abuse of credentials handed out to civilians with no law - enforcement roles abused : the badge , which is similar to the official ones worn by @entity46 law enforcement officials ( left ) , had been given to @entity14 councilman @entity47 ( right ) , who has been accused by the @entity17 of taking bribes the sheriff 's department has long faced criticism for dishing out badges to civilians with no law - enforcement duties because of fears it could lead to abuse			1
with the same six - pointed star design , they are very similar to the ones worn by deputies , although they read ' @entity63 @entity46 ' instead of ' deputy sheriff '			1
the department said the badges were handed out so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies , but some believe they are issued as rewards for political contributions			2
the gun - toting woman was pictured in the @entity74 nightclub in @entity14 wearing the badge given to councilman @entity47 , one of three officials accused of taking a total of $ 17,000 in bribes from the owner of a medical marijuana dispensary who wanted to open a store in the city			1
under pressure : @entity46 county sheriff @entity21 ( pictured ) is now recalling some 200 badges given to politicians , but insists the timing of the move was not linked to the release of the picture of the gun - toting woman the practice of giving out sheriff 's badges to city officials has been around since 1986 , according to an internal policy memo seen by the @entity98			1

sheriff spokesman @entity111 insisted the timing of the recall was coincidence and had actually been prompted by a warning by the state attorney general in 2007			2

but when questioned by the @entity98 about why it had taken more than four years to take action , he replied : ' that 's a good question			0
' @entity111 admitted the picture was a ' vulgar display ' , but said he was not aware of any other incident when a badge had been misused			0
the @entity98 reports , however , that it had been a problem in the past			0
one of the most notable was the case of the ' @entity136 ' @entity135 who had used a county emblem to pose as a police officer when luring his victims in the 1980s			0
one political contributor revealed previously how they used their honorary badge to gain access to a secure area of @entity145 in @entity146 .			0
