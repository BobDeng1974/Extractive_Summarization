it ’s great @entity1 is contemplating a move to the @entity3 , for him and the game in @entity6			1
i have been out in the @entity6 with @entity8 for half a season and loved every second			1
you can relax and enjoy a calm way of life			2
@entity14 would have gone out in @entity15 and been asked for pictures and autographs but will be able to walk around whichever city he choses in relative anonymity			1
i can understand if he goes for @entity21			2
we played there last season and were able to go out on the beach the day before the game as people went rollerblading up and down			0
what better way to spend your remaining years ? @entity1 has decided to leave @entity15 and his most likely destination appears to be the @entity3 @entity1 kisses the 2005 @entity31 trophy alongside @entity32 but will leave the club @entity34 says it 's a great move for @entity1 and the @entity3 that he is contemplating a move he could probably play on for another two years in the @entity37 , so it is an indication of how much the @entity3 has grown that he would think about joining			1
it is a complement to the league			0
@entity42 and @entity43 have paved the way and he can create just as big an impression			0
he is a @entity37 great and his presence will only bring the @entity3 on again			1
there will be more interest in @entity49 and highlights every time he scores			0
people may think @entity6 are only interested in sports like baseball and the @entity55 , but the fans at football matches are fantastic			0
they will tailgate for hours before kick - off and create atmospheres like @entity49 derbies every time			2
they bounce and sing for 90 minutes			0
coming from @entity62 , @entity14 will like that			0
i ’ve been able to explore @entity8 , a quirky city i would never have seen otherwise , live by a lake and spend afternoons chilling out on my boat , and get right into @entity6 fantasy football			1
@entity14 should come over with his family and get the experience too			0
@entity34 says @entity1 should definitely move across the pond to experience life in @entity6			1
