while young children must be shown the highway code to cross roads safely , it seems chimpanzees have taught themselves			1
researchers studying chimps in @entity7 say the apes are having to adapt to cope with increasingly busy roads cutting across their territory			1
they found at a busy asphalted road through the @entity14 area of @entity15 in @entity7 , the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing			1
chimpanzees crossing a busy road in @entity15 in @entity7 ( above ) have learned to look for traffic scientists discovered the chimps will also often run across roads , while dominant males will wait to ensure younger chimps cross safely			1
it is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to change their behaviour to adapt to busy roads			0
chimpanzees appear to flavour their food with herbs , researchers have suggested			0
dr @entity32 , a lecturer at the @entity34 in @entity35 , and her colleagues have found that wild chimpanzees in @entity7 eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught			2
they reason that if this was for medicinal purposes , different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments			0
however , the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat , suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead			0
dr @entity32 and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at @entity59 and @entity15 ate plants while chewing meat			1
@entity62 , a biologist at the @entity34 in @entity35 , who led the work , said the spread of road infrastructure in @entity67 was posing a growing threat to wildlife in many countries			0
she said : ' although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals , chimpanzees took into account this risk			2
' more than 90 per cent of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing			1
' chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups			2
whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups			1
' the researchers say the road in @entity14 sees around 89 motor vehicles an hour racing down it at speeds of between 40mph and 60mph			0
the researchers said they saw several different primates killed on the roads in the past year			0
however , chimpanzees living in the surrounding forests appear to have learned about the danger it poses			0
they watched 122 chimps cross the road over the course of two and half years			1
they found most of the chimps looked for traffic before crossing and as they crossed			1
adult chimps , like this one , tended to wait for younger chimps to cross and checked they got over safely females with young and injured adults tended to cross less frequently			2
around 20 per cent of the chimps that crossed would turn to check on other members of the group to ensure they were crossing safely			1
they also tended to form small groups of between two to three chimpanzees that crossed at a time			1
chimps have been noticed to cross in similar ways on other non-asphalted roads			2
however , on quieter roads , adults tend to lead the group in a similar way as they do when checking for predators rather than splitting up into smaller groups			0
the researchers , whose work is published in the @entity128 , have appealed for measures to help reduce the impact roads were having on wildlife			0
miss @entity62 , who worked on the study with dr @entity32 , a lecturer at the @entity34 in @entity35 and the @entity133 in @entity7 , said bridges or underpasses could be provided to help keep chimps safe			1
the team are hoping to work with the @entity7 authorities to test new safety measures			2
miss @entity62 said : ' these observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human - impacted habitats			0
' further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories			0
' mitigation measures , like bridges , underpasses , reduced speed limits , speed - bumps , signposts , or police controls , should be established in this area			0

chimps were observed crossing busy road in @entity15 , @entity7
most of the chimps looked left , right or both ways before crossing the road
the chimps crossed in small groups , often running to get across quickly
scientists want to test underpasses and bridges to let chimps cross safely
