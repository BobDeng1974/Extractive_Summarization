a stay of execution was ordered on wednesday morning for a schizophrenic killer who was set to face lethal injection within hours amid outcry that he is not mentally fit to be put to death			1
the judgement from the 5th @entity7 in @entity8 ordered that the execution of @entity10 , 56 , be postponed ' to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions '			1
the condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm ( @entity15 ) in @entity16			0
he was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife @entity18 's parents in front of her and their three - year - old daughter in @entity23 in 1992			1
in a sworn affidavit in 1999 , ms @entity18 said that although she hated what her ex-husband did , he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death			1
he is due to be executed later on wednesday - as attorneys made 11th hour pleas to save him , claiming he is too delusional to stand trial one of @entity10 's self - portraits on death row			1
attorneys who contend the condemned @entity8 inmate set to die today is too delusional for execution have asked the @entity47 @entity46 to halt his lethal injection the prisoner 's attorneys made an eleventh - hour appeal for their client saying he ' stands on the razor 's edge of competency ' and needs psychological evaluations to illustrate that his severe mental illness has worsened since he last was examined seven years ago			1
state attorneys contended @entity60 's condition ' has not markedly changed ' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection			1
no court has ruled @entity60 mentally incompetent or insane			2
the 56 - year - old native of @entity65 , @entity66 , was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1978			2
he had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting @entity70 and @entity71 at their home in the @entity74 in 1992			2
their daughter @entity75 , who was married to @entity60 , and her three - year - old daughter , @entity77 , had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep @entity60 away			2
ms @entity18 filed for divorce because of her husband 's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house			2

he was allowed to act as his own lawyer at trial and characterized himself as a cowboy			2

@entity60 was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls , believing that they were running with blood			0
on the morning of september 8 , 1992 , @entity60 armed himself with a rifle , a sawed - off shotgun and knives , dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife 's parents ' home in @entity23 , about 60 miles north of @entity116			1
both @entity70 and @entity71 were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter , before @entity60 allowed them to leave			1
he later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police			0
@entity60 's attorneys also have asked the @entity47 @entity46 to review the broader question of whether executing people who have mental illnesses violates the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment			2
in 1986 , the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they ca n't understand why they 're being put to death			2
in 2002 , the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired			0
five years later , ruling on an appeal from @entity60 , the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they 're being punished			1
@entity60 has insisted @entity142 is working through @entity8 prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the @entity144			1
both @entity70 and @entity71 ( pictured left ) were shot dead at close range in front of @entity60 's estranged wife @entity75 ( right ) and the couple 's three - year - old daughter @entity60 's attorneys want the death date withdrawn or at least delayed to allow for a new round of psychological testing to determine if he 's competent to receive the lethal injection			1
the prisoner is pictured with his parents , @entity157 and @entity158 , on death row testimony from @entity10 's 1995 murder trial showed the depth of his delusions when he insisted on representing himself in court			1

@entity60 's delusions ' have become more pervasive , ' according to one of his attorneys , @entity231 , who met with the inmate last week			1
@entity231 said @entity60 told him devices implanted in his teeth by prison system dentists were sending command messages to his brain , that in the sixth grade he had a fight with future president @entity241 at a @entity243 museum and that his tooth told him to write a letter of apology to @entity241			1
@entity247 , an assistant @entity8 attorney general , told the @entity46 on tuesday that records failed to support claims that @entity60 's mental condition had deteriorated and that some of his odd behavior could be deliberate			1
' @entity60 's mental health condition has long been exaggerated to his benefit and he continues this long established pattern here , ' @entity253 said			2
at his 1995 trial , @entity60 acted as his own attorney , testified as alternate personality ' sarge ' to describe the @entity18 slayings and tried to subpoena @entity262 , the pope and the late president @entity264			1
@entity60 wore a purple cowboy outfit , including a big cowboy hat , and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him			1

his mother said warning signs of her son 's mental illness appeared in his youth but she associated them with ' teenager weirdness ' during a prison interview in 2006 , @entity60 claimed he had been taken over by an alter ego he called @entity281 , the @entity282 reported			1

' my mother and i begged the police to take the rifles			0

' even though the police were told to take the guns , they did not			0
@entity168 had made threats against my parents			1
' she said that her initial police statement was made on the day of her parents ' shooting before she had received medical care and was completely traumatized			0
ms @entity18 said that she called the @entity321 about a week later when she felt her state of mind was more clear and wanted to add to her statement			0
she said : ' he [ the @entity321 ] told me it was best to leave things as they were and they would stick to the original statement given ...			0
i feel this was wrong of him ... i feel now that i was used on the stand so that i would cover up for the law enforcement mistakes and the sheriff of knowing @entity168 â€™s mental illness for years , not to mention all the other reports that were not written out			2
' she added : ' i do not hate @entity168			1
i hate what @entity168 did			0
@entity168 was a good person except when he changed ... i know now that @entity168 is mentally ill and should not be put to death			1
