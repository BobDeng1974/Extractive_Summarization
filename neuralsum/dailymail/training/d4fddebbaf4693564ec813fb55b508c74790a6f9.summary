scientists have found that oxygen in the air we breathe may play a role in triggering lung cancer oxygen in the air we breathe may play a role in triggering lung cancer , new research suggests			1
scientists found that rates of the disease decrease at higher altitudes , where there is less oxygen in the air			0
although oxygen is essential for life , the @entity20 researchers suggest the way our bodies process it is potentially carcinogenic			1
@entity7 is known to be highly reactive			0
when cells in the body use oxygen atoms to harness the energy stored in food , they produce a natural by - product called oxygen free radicals			1
these free radicals can cause damage to cell structures and dna , which in turn can trigger cancer			1
@entity41 , from the @entity42 , and @entity43 , from the @entity44 , compared cancer rates across 250 western counties in the @entity20 with varying altitude levels			0
they found that incidence of lung cancer fell by 7.23 cases per 100,000 individuals for every 1,000 metre ( 3,281 feet ) rise in altitude			0
although there was a strong association between elevation and lung cancer , they did not see the same link with breast , prostate or bowel cancer , suggesting a role played by the inhalation process			1
they said if the entire population of the @entity20 lived in @entity68 , which is at 3,470 metres ( 11,400 feet ) , there would be 65,496 fewer lung cancer cases every year			2
lung cancer kills an estimated 160,000 people in the @entity20 and 35,000 in the @entity72 every year			2
writing in the journal @entity75 , the scientists said there was ‘ substantial evidence ’ for an inhaled cancer - trigger ‘ tied directly to elevation ’			0
researchers from universities in @entity82 and @entity83 found that incidence of lung cancer fell by 7.23 cases per 100,000 individuals for every 1,000 - metre ( 3,281 feet ) rise in altitude			2
lung cancer kills an estimated 160,000 people in the @entity20 and 35,000 in the @entity72 every year they said exposure to sunlight and pollution , both of which are affected by elevation , was taken into account in their calculations			1
they added : ‘ viewing our findings through the lens of the literature , atmospheric oxygen emerges as the most probable culprit			0
‘ overall , our findings suggest the presence of an inhaled carcinogen inherently and inversely tied to elevation			0

@entity20 researchers suggest way our bodies process oxygen is potentially carcinogenic
free radicals in body can cause damage to cell structures and dna , which in turn can trigger cancer
link between elevation and lung cancer not seen with breast , prostate or bowel cancer
