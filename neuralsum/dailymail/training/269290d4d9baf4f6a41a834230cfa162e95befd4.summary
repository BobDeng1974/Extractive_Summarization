global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880 , @entity1 scientists claim			1
temperatures across the world averaged 0.8 ° @entity6 ) above 20th century averages - making 2014 the warmest year in records dating back 134 years			1
the @entity9 has already announced that 2014 was the hottest year for the @entity10 in records dating back to 1910			1
with the exception of 1998 , the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2010			2
in an independent analysis of the raw data , released today , @entity16 ( @entity16 ) scientists also found 2014 to be the warmest on record			1
@entity15 scientists claim their analysis of surface temperature measurements suggests the long - term warming of the planet			2
@entity27 , associate administrator for the @entity28 at @entity29 in @entity30 , said : ‘ the observed long - term warming trend and the ranking of 2014 as the warmest year on record reinforces the importance for @entity15 to study @entity13 as a complete system , and particularly to understand the role and impacts of human activity			1
’ since 1880 , @entity13 ’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 0.8 ° @entity6 ) over the 20th century average , which @entity15 ’s scientists said is a trend that ’s largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide , and other human emissions into the planet ’s atmosphere			1
the majority of that warming has occurred in the past three decades , they claim			0
@entity51 , director of @entity15 ’s @entity52 ( @entity53 ) in @entity54 , said : ‘ this is the latest in a series of warm years , in a series of warm decades			2
@entity16 's data also revealed that 2014 was the hottest year since records began			1
this map is made up of provisional data from 2014 up to october			0
it said , at the time , that there was no realistic scenario where the temperatures in november and december would not make it the hottest year last week , the @entity66 ( @entity67 ) claimed that 2014 was the hottest on record it said it was 0.27 ° c warmer than the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c warmer than the 20th century average - without the help of an @entity74 weather event			1
it too , found that 10 of the hottest years occurred since 1998			0
the @entity67 , @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity9 all made their calculations separately , but came to the same conclusion			1
experts say the rate at which it is warming is alarmingly quick , and heavily suggests the emission of co2 by humans is causing man - made global warming			0
the @entity67 's findings also reveal there has been no warming slowdown in the past decade , despite claims to the contrary by sceptics			0
‘ while the ranking of individual years can be affected by chaotic weather patterns , the long - term trends are attributable to drivers of climate change that right now are dominated by human emissions of greenhouse gases			0
despite 2014 temperatures continuing the planet ’s long - term warming trend , scientists still expect to see year - to - year fluctuations in average global temperature caused by events such as @entity74 or @entity105			1
these phenomena warm or cool the tropical @entity107 and are thought to have played a role in the flattening of the long - term warming trend over the past 15 years			0
however , 2014 ’s record warmth occurred during an @entity74 - neutral year			0
@entity16 analysis found that regional differences in temperature are more strongly affected by weather dynamics than the global average			2
for example , in the @entity1 last year , parts of the @entity118 and @entity119 were unusually cool , while @entity121 and three western states - @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 - experienced their warmest year on record			2
@entity15 ’s analysis incorporated surface temperature measurements from 6,300 weather stations including from @entity131 research stations and sea surface temperatures from ship and buoy - based operations			2
scientists analysed the raw data using an algorithm that takes into account the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heating effects that could skew the calculation			0
since 1880 , @entity13 ’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees @entity145 ( 0.8 degrees @entity146 ) , a trend that is largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet ’s atmosphere the result is an estimate of the global average temperature difference from a baseline period of 1951 to 1980			2
while @entity16 researchers used much of the same raw temperature data , they used a different baseline period and their own method to estimate global temperatures , but came to the same worrying conclusion			1
@entity15 scientists claim that their analysis of surface temperature measurements suggests the long - term warming of the planet , due to an increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet ’s atmosphere			0
a stock image of smoke emitted from smokestacks is shown @entity176 , policy director of the @entity177 at the @entity178 , said : ‘ the new global temperature record announced today completely exposes the myth that global warming has stopped			0
‘ there is mounting evidence all around the world that the @entity13 is warming and the climate is changing in response to rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere			0
a stock image of a green shoot in cracked , dry soil is pictured ‘ no politician can afford to ignore this overwhelming scientific evidence or claim that global warming is a hoax			0
’ the average temperature across @entity10 in 2014 was 9.9 ° c ( 49.8 ° f ) , some @entity198 ( 2 ° f ) above the long term average of 8.8 ° @entity200 ) , making it warmer than the previous record year of 2006			1
the @entity9 said the weather record of one individual year can not be attributed to man - made global warming			1
but it also points out that climate change makes warm years more likely than not			0
last week , @entity205 's @entity66 released its data for 2014 ( shown )			0
it said 2014 was the hottest year on record , at 0.27 ° c above the average from 1981 to 2010 , and 0.63 ° c above the 20th century average			1

@entity15 and the @entity16 both said that last year was the hottest since 1880
global temperatures averaged at 0.8 ° c ( 1.4 ° f ) above 20th century averages
this made 2014 the warmest year on records dating back 134 years
the @entity9 had already announced 2014 was the hottest year for the @entity10 in records dating back to 1910
