in my online q&a this morning there was a lot of focus on poor performances in the @entity6 but also on the current state of defending in the @entity8			1
one question in particular got me thinking : @entity10 were awful in defence again against @entity12			1
but are there any good centre backs any more ? i bet you ca n’t name 10 really good ones in the @entity8 ! @entity17 in @entity18 you ’re right , @entity19			1
i ca n’t ! at the moment i can only really think of five defenders in the @entity8 who are in good form , and even they are often dependent on their team - mates in front of them			1
per @entity25 and @entity10 endured a miserable collapse against @entity12 in the @entity6 @entity27 & @entity28 @entity27 is still such a reliable force for @entity30 and enjoying life again under @entity32			1
he has been important in the development of @entity28 who i now feel is the most important player in the @entity30 back four			1
he has an excellent combination of mobility and physicality but he reads the game so well			1
they make a formidable pair and are a large part of @entity30 ’s success this season			2
but even they can be troubled if they do n’t get the proper amount of midfield protection			2
@entity49 were able to isolate them and when they did , @entity51 went past @entity28 – the most consistent defender in the league – as if he was n’t even there			2
that shows the importance of defending as a team			1
@entity27 and @entity28 are the defensive rock holding up @entity32 's @entity8 leaders @entity60 & @entity61 @entity62 started as @entity60 ’s primary partner but now @entity61 , on loan from @entity65 , has taken his place			1
between them they have conceded just five goals in the league			2
only @entity71 ( three ) and @entity72 and @entity73 ( both four ) have conceded fewer this season			2
not bad for a side who were supposed to be relegated ! under @entity79 they are well drilled , they deal with crosses well and they are competent in possession			2
as individuals they may not stand out but with either @entity85 or @entity86 dropping in to cover , they work well within an effective system			2
@entity88 defender @entity61 ( left ) has impressed since joining the club on loan in the summer @entity60 ( left ) has formed a formidable partnership with @entity61 at the heart of the @entity88 back line @entity94 @entity95 are in form and @entity94 has been solid in their defence			1
@entity98 and @entity99 have been good but @entity94 is the most impressive member of their back line			0
even then he has mostly just been getting the basics right rather than doing anything spectacular as an individual			0
@entity95 are flying as a team , which always helps any defence , but @entity94 has been compact and consistent			0
@entity94 is solid and not spectacular but is enjoying a fine season for @entity95 it is a defender ’s responsibility to help shape and set up the team in front of him			0
you have to help build that barricade			0
if a midfielder is charging forward , you need to have words and make sure he does his job , otherwise you can be left exposed			0
you have to be prepared to open your mouth and ask for some help			0
i fell out with @entity121 on a few occasions at @entity10 when we disagreed about our positioning			1
but it was always over in a flash and we respected each other for being brave enough to speak up			0
i ’d like to see defenders demand more from those around them			0
@entity130 ( bottom ) suffered a painful end to the @entity134 derby and has not shored up @entity136 's defence @entity137 ( centre ) is @entity139 's captain and centre back but is not shutting out the opposition even @entity143 captain @entity142 is not playing at his best this season if you are under pressure , you need to make sure gaps in front of you are filled and the game settles otherwise you ’re in danger of letting the momentum change			1
that ’s what happened against @entity12 – @entity10 gave away the impetus and they were punished			1
every team these days is stocked with players capable of embarrassing you , not just the top sides			1
it ’s up to you as a defender to want to keep them out more than they want to score			0
good defending is all linked to your mentality and your desire			1
a lot of players spend time doing weights to build up their strength , but that inner strength does n’t come from the gym			0
you need an attitude of : i want to win			0
i want to clear every ball and win every battle			0
if you want it badly enough all over the pitch then you create that physical energy , which makes you look more powerful than you are			0
if you ’ve got that hunger and drive then it becomes infectious			0
you just need to let your team - mates know you expect them to back you up .			0

@entity10 suffered embarrassing defensive collapse against @entity12
other @entity185 clubs were also defensively poor in @entity6
they *reflect* a wider drop in *standards* of defending in @entity8
only five centre backs are in top form in the top flight
