by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 9 september 2012 when you think how much it costs the likes of @entity5 to take astonishing images like this , it ’s even more impressive what a teenager can do on a £ 200 budget			1
@entity11 , 19 , of @entity12 , @entity13 , managed to capture these incredible views of the earth from space - using little more than a balloon and a second - hand £ 30 camera bought on @entity18			1
with a scientific background consisting of just a physics a-level , @entity11 spent 40 hours working on a homemade box with a gps tracker , radio and microprocessor - which he released last thursday			1
cheap device : @entity11 managed to capture these incredible views of the earth from space using little more than a balloon and a second - hand £ 30 camera bought on @entity18 aerial : this photo was taken as the device , which took @entity11 40 hours to build , found its way up to space spectacular : the images look like they could be the latest taken from a multi-million pound @entity5 satellite after taking two - and - a - half hours to float more than 20 miles up into the earth 's stratosphere , the impressive device captured these amazing views from space			1
he used a gps tracker similar to a car 's satellite - navigation unit to follow its progress and located it with a radio transmitter following its fall back to earth , having reached speeds of more than 150mph			1
but the modest teenager , who is now an engineering student at the @entity52 , said today that the results were nothing more than ' a little project ' and a ‘ bit of a hobby ’			2
he said : ‘ i just wanted to set myself a challenge - but i 'm amazed at the results			0
i saw a guy who did a similar thing a couple of years back and i just wanted to recreate them - but better			2
modest : @entity11 , who is now an engineering student at the @entity52 , said today that the results were nothing more than ' a little project ' and a ' bit of a hobby ' technological prowess : the built - in circuit board allowed @entity11 to record the speed , g - force and altitude his balloon was reaching at all times found : @entity11 is pictured with his brother @entity75 , 12 , and his balloon contraption , which climbed to three times the height of a commercial plane before it burst ' i have no background in astrophysics - i 'm just an engineering student			2
people think it ’s something that costs millions of pounds but i 've proved you can do it on just a £ 200 budget			1

people think it ’s something that costs millions of pounds but i 've proved you can do it on just a £ 200 budget ' @entity11 @entity11 bought a standard @entity95 camera on @entity18 around 18 months ago when he first had the idea for the project			1
he placed it in an insulated box along with a small video camera , two temperature sensors , two high - performance solar panels , a tracking device , microprocessor and radio			1
the student then attached it to a high - altitude two metre latex balloon with a parachute - and named his contraption ‘ @entity111 ’			0
following the launch , he tracked the balloon as it climbed to three times the height of a commercial plane before it burst and landed in @entity116 , @entity13 - 30 miles from his home			2
amazing : this photograph snapped by @entity11 's device after take off shows the city of @entity121 in view landscape : this photo taken after take off shows the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity121 in the distance soaring : video footage taken alongside the photos shows it swirling through the clouds to dizzying heights the built - in circuit board allowed @entity11 to record the speed , g - force and altitude his balloon was reaching at all times			1

' i just wanted to set myself a challenge - but i 'm amazed at the results			0
i saw a guy who did a similar thing a couple of years back and i just wanted to recreate them - but better ' @entity11 he added : ‘ when i retrieved the camera i was stunned - it had captured some incredible photos and footage			2
the exposure settings were different to my previous two attempts			0
‘ i used materials which would be more robust in extreme temperatures and this led to clearer photos at altitude			0
the onboard video camera recorded great footage close to the ground after launch			0
‘ however the lens fogged up at about 3km ( 1.9 miles ) in altitude because moisture got in - but it still looked rather impressive			0
‘ i 'm now working on project , which will allow me to control where the box lands when it falls back to earth			1
but that 's work in progress at the minute and i 'll have to be content with this for now			0

device costing £ 200 launched by @entity13 teenager @entity11
spent 40 hours working on box with gps tracker , radio *&* microprocessor
located device after fall back to earth having reached speeds of 150mph
