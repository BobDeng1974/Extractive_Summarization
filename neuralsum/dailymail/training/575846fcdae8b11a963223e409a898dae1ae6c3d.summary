by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter crews are battling to clean up a major @entity5 shipping channel in @entity6 after a barge carrying almost one million gallons of thick , sticky oil collided with a ship in @entity10 near @entity11 , threatening an important shorebird habitat			1
no timetable has been set to reopen the waterway after nearly 170,000 gallons of tar - like oil spilled on saturday , creating a huge oil slick			1
but on monday , more help was being called in to contain the spill and protect wildlife			2
a barge carrying about 900,000 gallons of the heavy oil collided with a ship in the busy @entity23 , spilling as much as a fifth of its cargo into one of the world 's busiest waterways for moving petrochemicals , according to the @entity31			1
oil had been detected 12 miles offshore in the @entity33 by sunday , and as many as 60 vessels were either waiting to get in or out			2
the @entity31 - which called it a ' significant spill ' - said it expected to deploy more containment booms on monday , with 24 vessels working to skim the oil			1
two decades on and the coast remains polluted by the oil			2
environmental groups said the @entity6 spill occurred at an especially sensitive time			1
the channel in @entity64 , about 45 miles southeast of @entity11 , has important shorebird habitat on both sides , and tens of thousands of wintering birds are still in the area			1
' the timing really could n't be much worse since we 're approaching the peak shorebird migration season , ' said @entity72 , conservation director of the @entity73			2
he noted that just to the east is the @entity75 , which attracts 50,000 to 70,000 shorebirds to shallow mud flats that are perfect foraging habitat			2
fewer than 10 oiled birds had been found and recovered for transfer to a wildlife rehabilitation center as of sunday afternoon , according to the @entity31			0
the @entity82 has also deployed a bird rehabilitation trailer in the area for quick response			0
' this is a significant spill , ' capt. @entity86 , commander of the @entity31 at @entity11 - @entity10 , said			1
but he said the emptying the remaining oil from the barge on sunday , a process known as lightering as contents are transferred to other vessels , was an important step and eliminated the risk of additional oil spilling			1

some black tar - like globs , along with a dark line of a sticky , oily substance , could be detected along the shoreline of the @entity133 , a 5 - mile - long jetty that juts into @entity10 across from a tip of @entity136			0
' that is the consistency of what the cargo looks like , ' @entity140 , executive vice president of @entity11 - based @entity141 , said when the substance was described to him at a news conference			2
@entity140 said the company - the nation 's largest inland barge company and owner of the barge that spilled the oil - was taking responsibility for the costs			1
' we 're very concerned			0
we 're focused on cleaning up , ' he said			0
the barge has been moved to a shipyard and is no longer at the scene of the spill , according to a statement sunday evening from @entity6 gov. @entity159 's office			2

but it will remain closed for a third day monday , and the @entity31 said there was no timetable on when it may reopen			0
if the bottleneck of vessels in the @entity33 eases in a day or so , there likely would n't be much impact on fuel prices			0
but a more prolonged backup could push up prices briefly , said @entity211 , president of energy consultancy @entity212 and @entity214 in @entity215			0
the contents of the torn tank , equal to about 4,000 barrels , were lost or displaced into other vacant areas of the barge			0
@entity86 said currents , tides and wind were scattering the spill			0
' containment was never a possibility in this case , ' he said			0
the @entity31 and @entity228 are still investigating what happened			0
' it will take quite a bit of time , given the complexity of the vessels and a very busy waterway , ' @entity86 said			1
