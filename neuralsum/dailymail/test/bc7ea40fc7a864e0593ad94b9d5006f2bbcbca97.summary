@entity4 , who was a @entity5 minister from 1963 to 1967 , is urging world powers to release what he believes to be hidden data on @entity9 ' you just have to keep working away and hope that someday you get a critical mass , ' he said , according to a report by @entity25			1
' [ the public ] will say , in one way or another , " mr president or mr prime minister we want the truth and we want it now because it affects our lives			2
" ' @entity4 , 91 , first went public with his belief in aliens on @entity37 in 2005 , becoming the first high ranking politician to do so			1
he claims that the aliens have ' been visiting our planet for thousands of years ' and are unimpressed with how we live			1

@entity4 is the first high ranking politician to publicly state that aliens are real watch the full interview here last year , the former @entity5 defence minister declared on @entity55 tv that aliens are walking among us			1
but he said they are refusing to share their advanced technologies until we change our polluting and warring ways			0
he told @entity63 's program @entity64 there are 80 different species of extra-terrestrials some of whom ' look just like us and they could walk down the street and you would n't know if you walked past one			2
' in the bizarre interview , @entity4 made a series of pronouncements about aliens which grew increasingly outlandish and sounded closer to the plot of @entity79			1
' we have a long history of ufos and of course there has been a lot more activity in the last few decades since we invented the atomic bomb , ' he said			0
' they are very concerned about that and that we might use it again , because the whole cosmos as a unity , and it affects not just us but other people in the cosmos			0
' they are very much afraid that we might be stupid enough to start using atomic weapons again			0

another group of aliens are called ' @entity133 ' who have very slim arms and legs and are about five feet high with large heads			0
a third group are called ' @entity139 ' and @entity4 said that if you meet one you 'd probably say , ' i wonder if she 's from @entity143 or somewhere			2
