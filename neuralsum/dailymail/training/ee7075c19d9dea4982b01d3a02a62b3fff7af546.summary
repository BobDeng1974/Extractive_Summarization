the @entity18 are not the only one opposing the new cuts and payments			0
the @entity94 and the @entity95 are also opposed to the measures mr @entity31 went on further to say the government was using the state 's cuts to schools and hospitals funding as a smokescreen to hit taxpayers with another tax			2
