for seven years , the @entity0 has faked repatriations where military personnel carry honored dead soldiers off of planes as part of their ceremonial return to the @entity7 while the @entity0 insists the coffins indeed contain the remains of @entity12 soldiers returned to @entity7 from foreign wars , it now admits that the @entity15 arrival ceremonies often attended by a tearful audience are n’t actually arrivals at all			1
in fact , the coffins are toted out of planes that can no longer even fly , but must be towed onto the runway for the phony ceremonies and the remains have sometimes been back in the country for months			1
the @entity0 admits that most remains in the ' arrival ceremonies ' had been back in the @entity7 for a long time the ceremonies are handled by the @entity28 , an agency charged with recovering some 83,000 missing service men and women from @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34			1
until now , agency has allowed the public to believe that flag - draped boxes pulled from @entity39 military planes contained the rediscovered dead from those countries			1
but the @entity0 acknowledged to @entity42 wednesday that , in fact , the remains had only just been removed from a lab at @entity46 in @entity47			1
now , the events will be known as ‘ honor ceremonies			2
’ ‘ the name changed because they 've already arrived , technically , ’ @entity51 staff sergeant @entity50 told @entity42			0
@entity54 : ceremonies like the one pictured ahve been revealed as having taken place as long as months after remains were recovered from @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity32 battlefields @entity28 identifies around 80 soldiers per year			1
after their ceremonies — during which buglers play taps and audience members sing the @entity66 following a chaplain ’s prayer — the remains are returned to the lab. a military official thanks attendees for ‘ welcoming them home ’ before they ‘ begin the identification process			1
’ on average , it takes about 11 years and a $ 1million to identify each of them			2
helping further dupe attendees is the use of an airplane that many believed had actually just flown the remains home			1
a plane is towed to where the ceremony will take place prior to doors opening to the public			0
it is often a plane that can no longer even fly			0
duped ? while attendees watched believing the remains had just arrived , they were carted off planes that do n't even fly and back to the same labs they were carted out of prior to the ceremony ‘ many times , static aircraft are used for the ceremonies , as operational requirements dictate flight schedules and aircraft availability , ’ @entity0 spokesperson , navy commander @entity95 told @entity42			1
though they defended the practice , military officials took the blame for any misconceptions that have come of the so - called arrival ceremonies			2
‘ based on how media announcements and ceremony remarks are currently written , it is understandable how these “ arrival ” ceremonies might be misinterpreted , leading one to believe the ceremonies are “ dignified transfer ceremonies , ” which they are not , ’ @entity115			0
one ceremony bagpiper told @entity42 that even he believed the remains were just delivered from abroad			0
weeping attendees would sing and buglers would sound taps , followed by a chaplain 's prayer			1
@entity123 's were thanked for helping to welcome the men home ‘ it was a very humbling experience for me , ’ said bagpiper @entity125			0
‘ the thing that i remember most vividly is the silence			0
... it meant respect and a feeling that these soldiers are welcomed home			0
’ @entity133 who once worked for @entity28 said the agency has always known of their deceit			2
‘ it 's an open fraud inside @entity28 , ’ he said of the bogged down agency			2
‘ but it 's more than just the arrival ceremony			0
the fraud is really their inability to bring closure to more families			0
our noble mission is to go find some of these kids , and this thing is so fouled up we do n't even recognize the mission			0
’ the military stands by the spirit of the ceremonies , however			0
regardless of how or when the remains got to the base , the @entity0 said they ‘ reat the remains with the utmost of care , attention , integrity , and above all , honor ’ once here			1
costly : after their ceremonies , the average specimen takes around 11 years and $ 1 million each to identify			2

the @entity28 has handled the identification and repatriation of soldiers from old battle fields for seven years
remains were taken off planes in coffins draped with flags while taps played and then attendees sang the @entity66 , *suggesting* the fallen soldiers had just been returned
the @entity0 now admits that the ceremonies were held on *defunct* planes after remains had been in a lab for months
the ceremonies in a @entity15 base honored pows and @entity185 from @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity32
