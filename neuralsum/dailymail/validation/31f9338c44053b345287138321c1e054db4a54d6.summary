the mystery surrounding the demise of @entity2 - an @entity4 setter which died under suspicious circumstances after returning from a dog show in @entity7 - could finally be solved			1
the beloved dog died days after returning from the @entity9 show in @entity7 , sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was ' murdered ' by a bitter rival			1
and just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast - acting illegal pesticide , residents of his hometown of @entity16 , @entity17 , have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer			1
his devastated owner @entity42 , 34 , was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone			0
however , toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in @entity17 as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast - acting			1
now locals have claimed ten dead cats have been found in the past two months alone			2
one resident , @entity55 , claimed she had lost three since january and her neighbour two , according to @entity57 , reporting for @entity58			0
local @entity59 said she was now too scared to take her dogs out for walks in the village , claiming a pet killer unhappy about dogs ' barking could operate quickly by simply throwing poison out into the streets and parks			0
prize - winning @entity69 was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of @entity17 local veterinarian @entity72 , ( unrelated to ms @entity59 ) , said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats , but said there were ' symptoms suggestive of intoxication '			1
their claims are backed up by the evidence - @entity82 , secretary for the @entity84 which organises @entity9 , said this week two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for @entity2 's death			2
' there has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at @entity9 and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to @entity9 that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons , thought to be on a piece of beef , were eaten in @entity17 , shortly before @entity2 's death			1
' we have had confirmation , including from independent toxicologists , that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting			2
' severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours			0
' considering we are told that @entity2 showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in @entity17 , late on friday march 6 night , leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention , we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at @entity9 on thursday march 5 , some 28 to 36 hours earlier			1
' the family 's vet dr @entity72 reiterated this - telling the @entity114 fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died			0
' i doubt that it happened at @entity9			0
i think it 's unlikely because of the long time delay			0
i am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case			0
' @entity42 ( pictured with her son @entity122 and the litter @entity2 was born part of ) said they were struggling to cope with the dog 's death			2

@entity2 , an @entity4 setter , died 24 hours after returning from @entity9 dog show
