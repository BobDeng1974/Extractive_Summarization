like most people who lose a beloved pet , @entity0 is grieving for her cat @entity4			1
the playful tabby arrived in @entity0 ’s life 15 years ago as a lively kitten and soon became a big part of her family			1
‘ @entity4 was always such a boisterous little thing , ’ says @entity0 , 38 , an insurance underwriter from @entity11 , @entity12			1
‘ she loved being out in the garden and every summer i ’d look out of the window and see her flying through the air trying to catch butterflies			0
then at night she ’d be so loving and would curl up close to me on my bed			0
that ’s the thing i miss most , our snuggle time			0
’ mourning : @entity0 , 38 , is grieving for her cat @entity4 , 15 , who was diagnosed with dementia last december @entity0 , who is married to @entity24 , 31 , a fireman , and has three children , @entity26 , 14 , @entity27 , seven , and @entity28 , eight weeks , admits that she wells up when she reminisces about her pet			1
but @entity4 is n’t dead			1
she is one of more than 1.3 million @entity32 cats and dogs with dementia , which has a devastating effect on their lives — and those of their owners			1
‘ every night it takes me two or three hours to try to settle her to sleep because she ’s so distressed and does n’t know where she is , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ she ’ll miaow loudly and pace up and down for ages before she sleeps			0
‘ in the morning i ’ll come downstairs and whereas before she used to jump off the table and come purring around my legs , now she simply does n’t respond			0
she just stares blankly back at me and it ’s obvious she has no idea who i am			0
‘ she never used to have toilet accidents but now it happens most nights			0
sometimes when the back door opens she will wander outside and i feel a huge sense of panic because if she gets lost , she wo n’t be able to find her way home again			0
she ca n’t even find her bowl			0
’ @entity62 time : @entity0 cuddling @entity4 ( left ) and @entity4 as a kitten ( right ) recent research from the @entity65 found that half of all cats over the age of 15 and a third of those aged 11 to 14 suffer from dementia			1
another study found that 41 per cent of dogs aged 14 and over and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over also suffer			1
although most studies so far have focused on cats and dogs , owners are reporting behaviour similar to dementia in a variety of animals , including rabbits , guinea pigs and even parrots			1
if your pet is eight or older , and you answer yes to one or more of these questions , consult your vet : does your pet pace or wander aimlessly , finding it hard to settle ? does it stare blankly as if unaware of surroundings ? does it fail to recognise or respond to familiar people such as family and friends ? does it get lost or confused in the home or garden ? is it forgetful — for example , forgetting to go to the toilet or repeatedly seeking attention ? does it vocalise repeatedly or for no reason ? the irony is that the disease is actually a result of domestic animals living beyond their natural life expectancy , as loving owners pay out for expensive food , medication and surgery to keep their pets alive			1
‘ the main form of dementia in animals is called @entity125 , which is a degenerative brain disease remarkably similar to @entity127 ’s in humans , ’ explains @entity117 , honorary lecturer in @entity119 at the @entity120 , @entity121			1
‘ as with humans , areas of the brain stop working properly which leads to problems with learning , memory , sleep patterns , social interaction and continence			0
’ @entity117 believes that , just as humans are increasingly suffering from dementia due to our rising life expectancy , our pets are being stricken by the disease because they are living longer than ever			1
the average dog now lives to the age of 12 and a cat to 14			1
so , to some extent , animal - loving owners are responsible for the rise in dementia			2
‘ years ago we were n’t seeing pets live until 17 or 18 years of age and nowadays we do , ’ says mr @entity117			2
‘ their brains are n’t evolved to live so long — they wear out			0
’ the rise is so sudden that animal insurer @entity156 recently revealed claims for vet appointments regarding dementia have increased by 23 per cent for dogs and 48 per cent for cats over the last three years			1
@entity163 , associate professor in @entity164 at the @entity165 , says — as with humans — experts are still in the dark as to why some animals are afflicted and not others			0
‘ loss of cognitive function with age in dogs and cats is associated with similar structural changes in the brain to people — an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain tissue			1
‘ the amyloid accumulates within the nerve cells in the brain , altering how it functions			0
’ heartache : @entity0 says the affect of dementia on your pet , and your life as an owner , can be devastating @entity0 found out that @entity4 had dementia last december			1
vets usually diagnose the condition after hearing about the change in the pet ’s behaviour , and undertaking a full physical examination and a range of tests			0
loving friend : as @entity4 is not in pain @entity0 and her family plan to make her comfortable until the end putting down a pet with serious dementia may be an option , particularly if they are in physical pain or injuring themselves			1
however , it is not always the kinder option , as senile pets can live perfectly comfortable lives			2
‘ some days @entity4 does n’t even remember what she likes eating any more , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ a few weeks ago she left a bowl of her favourite cat food and went into the living room and lapped baked beans off my son ’s plate			2
she never liked them before			0
she also gets disorientated and walks round and round the garden like she ’s trying to get her bearings			0
‘ three months ago @entity4 managed to squeeze through a gap in the fence and i found her wondering in the grounds of the local hospital looking lost			1
‘ we were told that there ’s no medication we can give her			0
she ’s not in pain so the kindest thing is to make her comfortable at home and spoil her			0
i ’ll be her best friend to the end			0
she has been a loving friend to me			0
’ as well as the one million cats with dementia in the @entity32 , there are 300,000 dogs who suffer from the condition , too			1
@entity242 ’s 12 - year - old @entity241 , @entity243 , was diagnosed a year ago			1
‘ she was such an energetic and playful little dog , ’ says @entity242 , 45 , a housewife who is married to @entity244 , 48 , a furniture manufacturer , and mum to @entity247 , 21 , @entity248 , 18 and @entity249 , 16			2
‘ as she got older , she started to sleep more			0
then a year ago we noticed her bumping into furniture and getting lost on walks , which was heartbreaking			2
heartbroken : @entity242 , 45 , and her @entity241 terrier @entity243 , 12 , who was diagnosed with dementia a year ago ‘ we took her for a check - up and discovered she ’d gone partially deaf and blind in her old age			1
‘ but something still did n’t add up and six months later @entity243 started behaving oddly and barking for no reason			2
’ @entity242 , from @entity259 , @entity12 , took @entity243 back to the vet , who diagnosed dementia			1
‘ we were n’t told about any medication that could help @entity243 so we just got on with caring for her ourselves			2
it helps that we also have @entity264 , a three - year - old schnoodle ( a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle ) , and she encourages @entity243 to get up and play			1
she even helps guide her round the house			0
’ elderly pets : @entity243 is one of 300,00 dogs in the @entity32 who suffer from the condition , with 41 per cent of dogs aged over 14 suffering and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over @entity276 , 56 , a research manager from @entity277 , @entity278 , cares for her mother @entity279 , 88 , who has @entity127 ’s			1
@entity276 realised her 20 - year - old cat toffee had dementia when he started displaying similar symptoms to her mother			1
cat protection : @entity276 , 56 , with her cat toffee , 20 ( left ) and @entity287 as a young cat ( right ) ‘ my mother would often eat her dinner , i ’d take the plate away , then sit down to eat mine and she ’d shout and ask me , “ where ’s my dinner ? ” she thought she had n’t had it and wanted it again			2
‘ toffee would do the same			0
he ’d eat his dinner and instead of curling up and sleeping , he ’d go back and stand by his bowl and miaow for it all over again			0
‘ i volunteer as a welfare officer for @entity305 and i ’m trained in cat health so my heart sank			2
i knew it was dementia			2
’ surprisingly , despite the rise in pet dementia , it often goes under - reported by vets			2
symptoms : @entity276 recognised @entity315 was suffering from dementia because he started displaying similar behavior to @entity276 's mother , a dementia sufferer ‘ we may be detecting only about one in eight cases because signs of dementia just are n’t visible in a consultation , ’ says @entity117			2
‘ we rely on owners to spot the signs and tell us			0
if you diagnose a senile pet early , you can get in quickly and start treating them sooner with much better results			0
just six months can see a pet decline rapidly			0
’ some owners say pet dementia can be slowed down using games to exercise and stimulate their animals , although there is no cure			2
gently stroking @entity4 , who is now purring softly , @entity0 knows only too well the heartache of suddenly ‘ losing ’ a pet to dementia			1
she says : ‘ this is something every animal lover should be aware of			0
the impact on your pet — and your own life — can be devastating			0

@entity0 's cat @entity4 is one of 1.3m @entity32 cats and dogs with dementia
half of all cats aged over 15 suffer from dementia , and 41 per cent of dogs aged over 14
@entity359 's dog @entity243 was diagnosed with dementia last year
pets are being stricken by the disease because of rising life expectancy
research shows that rabbits , guinea pigs and parrots also suffer
