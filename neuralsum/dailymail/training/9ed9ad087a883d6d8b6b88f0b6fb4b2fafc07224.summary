the @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 is paying $ 544,000 for a shiny new @entity4 profile , in the wake of a partial government shutdown that followed a top @entity8 's assurance that ' the cupboard is bare , there 's no more cuts to make			2
' while @entity14 was wrangling in december over how many billions to trim from future budgets , @entity13 bureaucrats were spending like teenagers with their first credit cards			0
according to the ' @entity19 for government ' website @entity20 , the federal government has issued more than 1,300 procurement contracts since the beginning of december , including six - figure outlays for valet parking , portable toilets , expensive lamps , and special boxes to ship fruit flies from one government facility to another			1
the @entity33 will soon have a new @entity4 page complete with an easier way to attract job - seekers -- who could presumably find @entity38 if they were motivated anchors aweigh ! @entity40 will be able to go anywhere -- literally -- now that the government has requisitioned an expensive set of porta - potties ' more awesome , less suck ' -- the firm contracted to publish the government 's flagship environmental science journal is a specialist in social media targeting female consumers the @entity4 contract , first reported in the @entity52 , includes ' work with @entity0 ' banner ads and ' gold ' - level user pages commonly purchased by private companies , all designed to drive job - seekers to attorney general @entity60 's law enforcement agency			1
the @entity33 provided its contractor , the @entity63 , @entity64 - based @entity61 , with a not - so - helpful table of prices for @entity4 's services , in which all the costs were listed as $ 0			0
the agency contracting officer responsible for the award did not respond to a request for an explanation			0
@entity73 is also busily spending on other projects , from portable toilets to valet parking			2
the @entity77 green - lighted $ 450,000 for valet parking at @entity80 buildings in @entity81			1
broken @entity83 machines at the @entity84 will keep cranking this year , thanks to a $ 252,000 copier repair contract with a @entity89 , @entity88 company			0
did you know the federal government operates a fruit fly production facility in @entity93 ? now you do your 284,000 tax dollars at work : it 's reassuring to know that fruit flies are shipped in boxes labelled ' live insects , ' judging from this customized cardboard box when the @entity84 's copiers go on the fritz , they do n't have anyone in - house who can fix them -- so here come the contractors ! the @entity109 is spending $ 68,000 on disposable , biodegradable food trays to feed inmates			1
the @entity113 's @entity112 must be shredding a lot of worn - out currency , judging from the $ 791,000 contract it issued last month for hauling away trash and recyclables in @entity120			1
which lamps will the @entity121 buy ? the $ 498,000 purchase order does n't say and the @entity124 has agreed to spend more than $ 284,000 on an order for 5,400 shipping boxes to send fruit flies across the country from one facility to another			1
' each box consists of one ( 1 ) @entity132 , one ( 1 ) @entity133 , two ( 2 ) @entity135 , two ( 2 ) level stands , two ( 2 ) @entity137 , and one ( 1 ) @entity134 , ' according to the contract			0
' the finished boxes are to be delivered to the government 's ' fruit fly production facility ' in @entity142 , @entity93			2
in @entity81 , the @entity121 is set to pay $ 409,000 for portable toilets at the @entity144 in the town of @entity144			2
the contract is 106 pages long			0
the same agency is spending $ 498,000 on lamps , and sending $ 196,000 to @entity150 for ' 8gb flash memory ' – thumb drives – and other computer parts			2
the most expensive contract among those @entity155 flagged from december was an $ 11 million outlay from the @entity157 for a company to publish @entity159 , the agency 's academic journal			1
arrive for that x-ray in style : the @entity77 will shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for valet parking attendants at @entity81 hospitals how much does a recruitment ad on @entity4 cost ? do n't ask the @entity2 -- it appears to think they 're free federal prisoners are eating off of these disposable and biodegradable food trays -- instead of something that can be washed and reused -- judging from one 68,000 contract the @entity174 company that won the contract , @entity176 & partners @entity177 , advertises itself online as an expert in social media marketing to women with the tagline , ' more awesome , less suck			1
' @entity159 was accused in 2012 of participating in a human - experimentation study that exposed 41 people to airborne particles that the @entity157 says can cause death just hours after exposure			0
one subject was taken to the hospital after experiencing hart trouble during the experiment			0
the journal also caused a stir in 2012 when it published a widely mocked study claiming that fluoride in drinking water was poisoning children 's nervous systems .			0
