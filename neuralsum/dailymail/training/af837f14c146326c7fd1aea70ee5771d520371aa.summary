less than a week after he lifted the @entity5 trophy in @entity6 , @entity3 captain @entity2 has retired from international football			1
yes , there had been the odd report prior to the @entity5			1
@entity2 himself had admitted in february that he would not rule it out as a possibility			1
but it did n’t seem like a real consideration			0
many still did n’t believe it as @entity17 reported the story on friday morning			0
it would n’t have been the first time that the newspaper ’s anonymous sources had been mistaken			0
the @entity35 player was stepping down from international duties with immediate effect			1
' it is the right time for me to go , ' said @entity2			1
with 30 years and 113 caps , @entity2 is certainly not leaving in his prime			1
his departure will nonetheless be a hammer blow for @entity3			2
throughout the tournament in @entity46 , he proved himself not only to be one of the most tactically intelligent and diverse players on the planet , but also a worthy leader			0
he had to fight for that accolade , with many questioning his strength and leadership qualities along the way			0
others saw him as a little too arrogant			0
when he officially inherited the captaincy from @entity58 in 2010 , many were unhappy with the manner in which he did so			0
since then , though , @entity2 has proved time and again that he is the perfect leader for this team			2
he was quiet but confident , leading his team by example , whether playing at left back , right back or in central midfield			0
captain fantastic : @entity2 played in midfield and at right back as @entity3 won the @entity5 winner : @entity68 grabbed the only goal of the @entity5 final in extra time against @entity72 he has been greeted with overwhelming praise , with compliments from @entity75 , @entity76 and even chancellor @entity77			1
' i would like to articulate my huge respect for @entity2 and what he was done for our national team , ' said @entity77			2
his critics will no doubt see the same old arrogance in his decision to step down now , just days after his finest hour			0
@entity17 claimed that @entity2 was ' quitting while he is ahead ' , while @entity87 mused that he is a ' perfectionist '			2
but this decision was not a spontaneous act of vanity			0
the decision was allegedly made in the autumn of last year , and he informed coach @entity94 of his plan the morning after the @entity96			0
@entity97 , president of the @entity99 fa , said that ' it was clear within minutes of speaking to @entity2 that there was no way i was going to talk him out of it '			2
like his football , @entity2 's decision was considered and confident			1
where it all began : @entity2 made his debut for @entity3 in a 2 - 1 win over @entity111 in 2004 dejected : @entity2 was part of the @entity3 side that lost to @entity114 in the @entity116 final there are also footballing reasons to step down			1
the move into midfield is something which has seen less success for @entity3 than it has for @entity35			1
at 30 , he can no longer make the marauding runs up and down the right that he used to			0
for the national team , though , he is still more of a right back than a midfielder			2
@entity2 is leaving the national team as world champions , with no shortage of defensive talent that can be raised to replace him over the next two years			2
he is also leaving them with a captain			0
@entity134 has shown , not least in the @entity96 , that he can lead this @entity99 side as much as anyone , and is almost certain to take over the armband			0
as @entity2 himself said , " i am leaving this team in complete harmony "			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , will continue to play for @entity35 at least until his contract runs out in 2018			1
@entity142 rates him as the finest player he has ever coached , and will certainly not allow him to let up before then			0
@entity3 will survive without @entity2 but he will leave a gap			1
as a leader and a footballer , @entity2 was without doubt one of @entity3 ’s finest captains			1
playing on : @entity2 will continue to play for his club side , @entity99 champions @entity35			1

@entity2 has retired from international football
he won 113 caps for @entity3 , scoring five goals
@entity2 captained his side to victory in the @entity5 final this *summer*
midfielder will continue to play for club side @entity35
