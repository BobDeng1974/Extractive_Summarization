by @entity0 a little boy with a severe allergy to tomatoes was rushed to hospital after ketchup nearly killed him			1
@entity6 , two , from @entity7 in @entity8 , went into anaphylactic shock after he stuck his finger in one of his sibling ’s dinner			1
his parents @entity15 and @entity16 say they will never take him to @entity17 after fearing he would die during the reaction			1
the moment little @entity6 , two , was rushed to hospital by ambulance after touching the tomato ketchup @entity23 , 24 , feared son @entity6 , two , would die after he swelled up so much he could hardly breathe the toddler was just a year old when his face and tongue swelled so badly he could no longer breathe properly			1
mrs @entity23 , 24 , said : ‘ when i saw his face was so swollen i honestly thought he was going to die			2
' it was in september 2013 when she served her other children dinner with tomato ketchup that @entity6 touched the sauce and got a small bit on the end of his finger			1
his mother wiped off the ketchup and put him to bed			2
later that night when his brother , @entity39 , four , began making a lot of noise upstairs mr @entity6 , 40 , went to check on him			1
he quickly returned with @entity42 in his arms who had gone into anaphylactic shock			0
@entity6 ( left ) was diagnosed with eczema which he would scratch until it bled and ( right ) with his mother @entity15 his worried mother said : ‘ i was hysterical			1
i could n’t look at him			0
‘ my husband had to stay with him while i waited outside and called the ambulance			0
i was so scared that we might lose him			0
’ he was rushed to hospital by ambulance where medics gave him steroids and antihistamines			1
within 20 minutes his face had settled down and he was able to breathe normally			1
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ we were discharged quite quickly as his face stopped being as puffy			0
‘ it was n’t until the next morning when he started to look like himself again			2
’ doctors suggested that the tomatoes may have been the cause			0
to prevent the toddler facing a severe reaction again all of his food has to be specially prepared for nursery			2
@entity6 ( centre ) with his dad @entity74 , brother @entity39 , four , mother @entity15 , newborn 10 - week - old baby sister @entity72 and older sister @entity71 , five			1
the family feared the little boy might die after getting the ketchup on his finger the boy was initially diagnosed with acne but doctors later discovered he was suffering from eczema ‘ the thought of him touching one of the other children ’s tomatoes or ketchup still scares me and we are always on edge			1
‘ we steer clear or places like @entity92 ’s because we know there is going to be ketchup everywhere			2
’ she added : ‘ i was amazed that something as simple as ketchup could have such a reaction			1
’ developing an allergy to tomatoes or tomato - based products is ' extremely rare ' , according to @entity101			0
doctors believe an individual with a tomato allergy is also prone to allergic reactions with other nightshades , including potatoes , tobacco , and eggplant			0
@entity101 also say people with a tomato allergy will have a cross-reaction to latex as well ( latex - fruit syndrome )			0
despite its rarity there has been some tragedy with tomato allergies			0
in 2004 , a woman from @entity120 suffered a freak allergic reaction to tomatoes and died while preparing dinner for her four children			2
@entity127 @entity126 was opening a tin of spaghetti bolognese when the tomatoes in the sauce sent her into anaphylactic shock			2
the 37 - year - old , from @entity134 in @entity120 , was taken to hospital after she collapsed , but never regained consciousness			2
she was allowed to die four days later when the family decided that she had no chance of survival			1
it took a year for the family to realise that @entity6 had an allergy to the red fruit as he was initially diagnosed with acne			1
the toddler would scratch the spots that appeared when he was a few weeks old to such an extent he would be covered in blood			0
this later led doctors to diagnose him with eczema and he was prescribed emollient @entity151 and then steroids , but the skin problems got progressively worse			2
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ it was horrible for us seeing him like that			0
he was one of the happiest babies you could ever see when he was n’t scratching , but he was very distressed by it			0
’ his parents then noticed that meals containing tomatoes left the toddler with hives all over his skin			0
‘ we cut all tomatoes out of his diet , and this seemed to help with the majority of his symptoms , ’ added mrs @entity23			0
since the ketchup incident , he has had another three anaphylactic incidents despite his eagle - eyed parents keeping a constant watch over him			1
‘ he went into shock after eating a single baked bean			0
‘ he put it in his mouth and he started getting hives and other symptoms			0
’ the incidents were not as severe as with the tomato ketchup but he was still rushed to hospital			1
mrs @entity23 ’s other children @entity39 , four , and @entity71 , five , know how serious @entity6 ’s allergy is so make sure to keep anything containing tomato away from him			1
the couple ’s latest addition , 13 - week old baby @entity72 , will be taught when she is old enough that @entity6 can not be touched by what could be a deadly tomato			2
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ he is an amazing little boy and i would n’t change him at all			0
‘ i do worry about tomatoes coming into contact with him , but i think as he gets older he will just stay out of their way			0
’ @entity6 , two , pictured with his older brother @entity39 , four , who raised the alarm on the night of the allergic reaction his parents ( pictured ) have decided not to take @entity6 to @entity17 because there is ' ketchup everywhere '			1
